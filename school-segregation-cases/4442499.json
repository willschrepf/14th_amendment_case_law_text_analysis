F).\r\n\r\nDuring roughly the period of      Feb~~f;» 8,    2010,   through about February   27, 2012,\r\n\r\nMorris took various female e * e s with him on business-related trips to cities\r\n\r\noutside Texas. On each trip,   ~Qhis victims were thus isolated, far from home and all\r\nthe more vulnerable,   Q~ date-rape        drugged and, without their consent, sexually\r\n\r\nabused, molested anlhtook nude photographs of his unconscious and completely\r\n                    o~@>v\r\n\r\ninsensate and   d~eless victims. Although each trip arose out of Morris' capacity as\r\nPresident a~ of Edible and the supervisor of each of his victims, and the company\r\n\r\nshould be hcla liable for the intentionally tortious acts of its principal, Morris' predatory\r\n\r\nacts had nothing whatever to do with his victims' work conditions. Among his victims\r\n\r\nwas Ms. Farmer and Defendants' instant effort to characterize her claims as workplace\r\n\r\ncomplaints is franldy both cynical and delusional.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             3\r\n\f       In confirmation of that, it's important for the Court to note that in their instant\r\n\r\nM/MSJ, Defendants' entire Section II, \"Statement ·of Facts,\" (M/MSJ, pgs. 2-8),\r\n\r\naddresses the alleged nature and scope of Ms. Farmer's recollections of her violation by\r\n\r\nMorris, with numerous citations to her Original Petition, (Response Ex. A), her.\r\n\r\nstatement to the FBI, (Motion Ex. D), and her deposition, (Motion Ex. ~espouse Ex.\r\n                                                                       £~@;\r\nI), as though those documents constitute the exclusive factual    univ~ upon       which this\r\n\r\ncase and Ms. Farmer's claims are based. Moreover, such factu#entation adds much\r\n\r\nthat has no actual role in this case, namely Ms. FarmQ~iscussions of workplace\r\n\r\nconditions. First, she discusses such only in response .fu. Defendants' counsel's direct\r\n                                                     0~\r\nquestioning in her discovery deposition. Second, ~ facts might be very important\r\n\r\nwere Ms. Farmer asserting an employment        sexu~arassment\r\n                                                ~~\r\n                                                              or discrimination claim.\r\n\r\nHowever, regarding her actual claims, all ~ facts are completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n    Conversely, not a single word or re&nce is therein contained regarding the bigger\r\n\r\npicture of this case, which is, again,~ically important to each of the bases Defendants\r\n\r\nassert in support of their disne'fand/or summary judgment motion. Absent is any\r\n\r\nreference to the   Supersedi~dictment,        (Response Ex. F), Morris' Plea Agreement,\r\n                           IQJ~                                                .\r\n(Response Ex. G), and ~rris' persistently cynical denial of any responsibility for his\r\n                      ·~\r\nactions   whatsoever~reflected in Response Ex. H. 2 Careful examination of the fuller\r\npicture of wha#. Farmer had to say in her Original Petition, FBI statement and\r\n\r\ndeposition,$n considered in the context of the Superseding Indictment, Plea\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n See \"Software Exec Pleads Guilty to Drugging, Abusing Female Employees,\" December 3, 2014,\r\nhttp: l/www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article, \"Morris's attorney, Dan Cogdell, had said\r\nthat the women were consenting adults who willingly drank with Morris, and that Morris never\r\ndrugged anyone or intended to break any laws. He also said they [the women accusers, including\r\nMs. Farmer] were only making accusations against him to bolster civil suits pending in Harris\r\nCounty.\" (Such article is admissible pursuant to Tex. R. Evid. 902(6)).\r\n\r\n                                              4\r\n\fAgreement and media accounts of Morris' criminal lawyer's summary of Morris'\r\n\r\ncategorical denial of responsibility will demonstrate Morris to be a callous predator,\r\n\r\nwhose actions stunned Ms. Farmer and deeply affected her perceptions of what actually\r\n\r\nhappened to her. Defendants concentrate solely upon her representations in a vacuum\r\n\r\nbecause by doing so they cleverly attempt to diminish the emotional a~j'lsychological\r\n                                                                  f2~rf!!\r\nimpacts of her victimization. When those serious consequences are ~unably and quite\r\n                                                                      ~\r\nproperly factored in, Defendants' statute of limitations a~~xas Commission on\r\n\r\nHuman Rights Act, (\"TCHRA\"), preemption argument~upport of dismissal or\r\n                                          .                   Q·\r\nsummary disposition are revealed to be utterly untenabl~herefore, Ms. Farmer will, as\r\n                                                           0~\r\nbriefly as possible, present the fuller facts of this   c~nd then apply to those facts the\r\ncontrolling law. In doing so, she will        demon~~~to the Court's satisfaction that the\r\ninstant M/MSJ should be denied in each a~ry particular.\r\n\r\n        B. The complete facts.                 ~\r\n          In her deposition, (Respo~~· I),a Ms. Farmer testified in relevant part that\r\n\r\nshe went with Morris to Phil~j)hia and Newark about two weeks after she started\r\n\r\nworking at Edible, (75:18- ~), [in May, 2011]. She flew by herself and met Morris at\r\n\r\nthe Philadelphia       airpo~7:7-17). Morris had a rental car he used to pick her up,\r\n                           ~\r\n(77:18-21). This     w~ a Sunday evening, (77:25- 78:3);        and, they drove to the hotel,\r\n\r\n(78:2-4), (a    Ma~, (79:23)). Morris wanted to meet in the concierge lounge, but it was\r\n           ~ in the hotel bar, (79:2-8). They stayed there about an hour and a half,\r\nclosed so ~et\r\n\r\n(79:18-19); then she went to sleep, (79:20-21). However, the next night, they went to the\r\n\r\nNewark Marriott, (81:14-17); in order to see a New Jersey client the following day,\r\n\r\n(81:23-24). Later, she could vaguely remember being at dinner and that a comedian was\r\n\r\n3   Transcript citations are by page and line(s).\r\n                                                    5\r\n\fthere whose picture Morris kept taking, (84:13-22). She has no idea where they were or\r\n\r\nwhat she had for dinner, or any other details, (86: 9-13). She remembered going through\r\n\r\na tunnel on the way to dinner, but little else, (89:6-13). That evening, she and Morris\r\n\r\nhad met in the hotel concierge lounge and had drinks, (89:14-18). She drinks wine and\r\n\r\nasked for a glass of it, but Morris insisted she have a mixed drink, ~:18-25). She\r\n                                                                      _e~(fjj\r\ninsisted on wine and he poured her a glass, but, then he told her th~1ould get another\r\n\r\ndrink to-go and go to dinner in Manhattan and he insisted sh~~ a mixed drink, and\r\n\r\nhe fixed her a drink in a to-go cup, (90:17-25). Howeve~drink was so strong she\r\n\r\ncouldn't drink it, and she told him iliat. He then added ~·e soda to it and insisted iliat\r\n                                                         o;JEF\r\nshe drink it, (91:1-22). Shortly, she began to feel    v~dizzy,   (92:1-10). In the elevator,\r\n\r\nMorris began to massage her neck and back,      wh~ she thought was weird, (93:4-16);\r\n                                                o~JI\r\n\r\nshe told him that was not necessary      as~as         making her uncomfortable, and he\r\n\r\nstopped. But, later he put his hands o~r shoulders anyway, (93:16-25). By the time\r\n\r\niliey arrived in Manhattan, she wa~~oriented, (92:11-13); and, Morris began holding\r\n\r\nher hand which made her feel   ~~comfortable, (93:1-3).\r\n       Ms. Farmer has absoh~y no memory of anything about ilie dinner or going to it\r\n                           ~g~\"\"\r\nor getting home, (95:2{il6:15). At some point that night, she awoke in her hotel bed\r\n\r\nwith a pillow and\r\n                    .JJ!covers over her head and her blanket\r\n                    s~~~\r\n                                                      . down around her anldes.\r\nThen, she hear# click of a phone camera and she looked and realized she was naked\r\n\r\nand MorriSs standing over her, (81:23- 82:4). She was so tired she had trouble\r\n\r\nadjusting to what was going on and she muttered, \"Wait, I'm not ... like what is going\r\n\r\non?\" Then, she sat up and asked Morris if he had just taken a nude picture of her, (82:5-\r\n\r\n11); which he hastily denied, (82:12). She became upset and asked him what he was\r\n\r\ndoing there, and she told him to leave and to give her the picture she knew he had taken,\r\n\r\n                                            6\r\n\f(82:12-15). She was disoriented and confused, but she told him he could not have the\r\n\r\npicture, but he just said \"it was fine,\" (82:19-23). Then, Morris left the room and came\r\n\r\nright back in to show her his Blackberry, with no picture in it. She tried to index it, but\r\n\r\ncouldn't, (83:8-17). Then, he left again and she went back to sleep for four hours, (84:6-\r\n\r\n9).\r\n       She very vaguely recalls that when she awoke in her hotel\r\n                                                                        ~\r\n                                                                         *\r\n                                                                    ~ bed nude, with\r\nMorris standing over her, it was about 4:00am, (99:4-8). She# a d an apprehension\r\n\r\nthat he was taking nude pictures of her because she heaQ~ click of the Blackberry,\r\n\r\n(97:15-20). That he actually did so was not confirmed n~J much later after Morris was\r\n                                                            0~-\r\n\r\narrested and they found several nude photos of her~ locked flash drive in his office,\r\n\r\n(101:1-13). She clearly remembers him in her rlil;;J and herself naked in bed, (98:1-5).\r\n                                                       ~~\r\nHe left her room about 4:00 am and she t r e p t until about 8:oo am, (99:4-11). She\r\n\r\nemphatically denied giving Morris co~t to take nude pictures of her, (104:4-24).\r\n\r\nMore importantly, in addition to b~i?'Zil~ng she had been photographed nude, she also\r\n                                     ~~r'\r\nfeels certain that she was physi~'§ violated because she had redness in her vaginal area\r\n\r\nand bruises on her arm anch\"\\ip area\". (99:12-22). Although she did not feel she had\r\n                             ©~\r\nbeen raped, she felt li~she had \"been touched\" and she was sore in her \"female\r\n                      ~~\r\nregions\", especially(J),_,-...e outside, (100:1-10).\r\n\r\n       The nex#ning, incredibly, Morris was at the door of her hotel room asking\r\n\r\nwhy she   w~~ready to see the client! (102:7- 103:8). She met him downstairs and it\r\nwas she who was apologizing for being unprofessional, (103:11-15); she blamed herself\r\n\r\nfor losing control, (103:22- 104:3). In response, Morris dismissed her concern by saying\r\n\r\nit \"was no big deal\", (106:11-15). She felt terrible that day and continued to feel\r\n\r\ndisoriented, (107:1-7). Later, he told her he had \"never done anything like this before\r\n\r\n                                                 7\r\n\fand he really liked her.\" (113:4-7). Then, he claimed he had a bad marriage, (113:10-12).\r\n\r\nShe told him their relationship had to be professional; but, he told her he would hug her\r\n\r\nwhenever he felt like it, (113:13- 114:1). She started looking for another job immediately,\r\n\r\n(114:18-20) .. Ms. Farmer took one more business trip with Morris. On that trip, once\r\n\r\nagain, Morris had her meet him in the concierge lounge of their hote~6:9~10). He\r\n                                                                        ~®i\r\nasked her if she wanted a drink and she asked for a chardonnay. B1~tter he brought it\r\n\r\nto her, it tasted disgusting, like strong medicine, with a #itter alkaline taste,\r\n\r\n(116:18-25). She said the taste was definitely not a norm~, (118:3-25). She tried a\r\n\r\nfew sips and then said she couldn't drink it, (119:16-iRl. They went to dinner; and,\r\n\r\nafterwards, Morris pressured her to have       anothe~nk,\r\n                                                         ·~'   but this time she refused,\r\n\r\n(121:1-6). After they returned to Houston, she    ~~~y learned that Morris refused to talk\r\n                                                  ~\r\nto her anymore, for a pretextual reason~:14-25). And, he remained distant and\r\n\r\nstandoffish to her, (125:6-10).          ~\r\n       Contrary to Morris' deceitf~lil>resentation to Ms. Farmer that \"he had never\r\n\r\ndone anything list this before,   ~is criminal lawyer's comment that Ms. Farmer and\r\nthe other victims were    mo.v~\r\n                           ~JU\r\n                                making     allegations up to aggrandize their civil suits,\r\n\r\n(obviously including tl~one), ((Response Ex. H), it should be noted that in the\r\n                     ~\r\nSuperseding Indict~, he was criminally charged with very similarly violating four (4)\r\n\r\nother female   e&~yee victims, (Response Ex. F). And, while charge does not equal\r\nconviction,~gard to Ms. Farmer, in the Plea Agreement, (Response Ex. G), Morris\r\nexplicitly agreed to the truth and validity of the facts alleged in Count Five thereof, that:\r\n\r\n\"On or about May 8, 2011, Morris traveled in interstate commerce and committed, and\r\n\r\nattempted to commit, the drug-facilitated sexual assault of [Ms. Farmer].\" (Id., pg. 6-7).\r\n\r\nAnd, Morris further plead guilty to the offenses of \"violating 18 U.S.C. § 2421, as well as\r\n\r\n                                              8\r\n\fNew Jersey Statutes Annotated 2C:14-9(b), Invasion of Privacy.\" (Id.). Morris further\r\n\r\nagreed that he was arrested by the FBI on February 27, 2012, at IAH, when he was\r\n\r\nattempting to leave on another business trip. He had with him three bottles of the\r\n\r\n\"unknown liquid\" he used to dilute the drugs he administered to Ms. Farmer by means\r\n\r\nof alcoholic beverages he supplied to her. He also had four Viagra table~d four Cialis\r\n\r\ntablets for himself and five pills of the type he administered\r\n                                                                 _c;'il.~!f!j; Farmer, which\r\n                                                                 t~.\r\n\r\nincluded sleeping pills and sedatives, which according      t~~         analysis and a\r\n                                                            ~\r\nsupervisory FBI Forensic Chemist and Toxicologist were ~tent with the symptoms\r\n\r\nshe described when she was attacked by Morris, which~luded drowsiness, dizziness,\r\n                                                    0~~\r\n\r\nloss of muscle control, slurred speech,       deere~   inhibitions, memory loss or\r\n\r\n                                              ~~orris agreed that he drugged Ms.\r\nimpairment, loss of consciousness.

So, it's\r\n\r\nimperative for   ~ourt to observe that while she was very confused that night and\r\nafterwards,~ore story has been confirmed by forensic evidence and the confession of\r\nMorris!\r\n\r\n      In Ms. Farmer's statement to the FBI, dated February 22, 2013, (Motion Ex.

J). Jackson testified in her deposition,4 in re~t part, that\r\n                   .                                                          /?._'@\r\nShe drinks 2-3 mixed drinks daily, (28:3-9); and, she has often            be~put      drinking with\r\n\r\nDefendant Morris, (22:1-5; 27:19-21; 30:3-8; 33:25- 34:3).

This relationship included\r\n\r\nsexual intercourse, (50:1-4), ~tal penetration, (53:6-8), and allowing him to\r\n\r\nphotograph her nude,         (53:~~), on numerous occasions and in numerous locations,\r\n                        0~\r\n(53:24- 54:5).

The\r\n\r\nFBI now has the photos, (61:1-7). She also conceded that Morris confided to her\r\n\r\nthat he also took nude photos ofAndrea Farmer, (61:8-19).\r\n\r\n4   Citations to the transcript thereof are by page and line(s).\r\n                                                    10\r\n\f       Jackson said Morris often travels with small \"airplane\" bottles, (63:8-10); which\r\n\r\nshe assumed he used to \"re-cycle\" liquor, (63:24- 64:4); and, she has seen Morris often\r\n\r\nmake drinks for others, (68:12-14), including the use of \"to-go\" cups, (69:1-3).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she obdurately disagrees with Andrea Farmer's testimony \"too%\", (67:14-\r\n\r\n16). The Court can evaluate the credibility of such testimony.             '*\r\n                                                                         !f!1\r\n       Finally, in her Original Petition on file herein, (Response    rfi1' A), Ms. Farmer\r\nmade very clear that the factual basis of her claims was that:   \"~ant Morris drugged\r\nFarmer by putting an unknown substance into a drink, u~~ownst to Farmer. During\r\n\r\nthis time, Morris attempted to sexually assault     Farmer~~\r\n                                                       o;!f[F took pictures of her while\r\nshe was unconscious.\" (Id., pg. 2). Thus, while          t~aims   asserted are assault and\r\n\r\ninvasion of privacy, the gravamen thereof are dm2nduced unconsciousness and sexual\r\n                                                   O~J\r\n\r\nassault, the very crimes Morris has pled g~ in federal court.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, on the basis of this ~ of supporting evidence and information, it\r\n\r\nseems remarkably disingenuous tl),vfendants, in their instant M/MSJ, (filed January\r\n\r\n16, 2015, over five (5) weeks    ae~orris' entry of his sworn guilty plea), are even now\r\ncontending: (1) \"plaintiff WJili~Ware of the alleged assault and impermissible pictures\r\n                              g~\r\ntaken of her at the time~ events occurred,\" (M/MSJ, Pg. 3); (2) \"she could remember\r\n                      ~\r\n... Morris allegedly~aging in sexually inappropriate and/or offensive behavior with\r\n\r\nher,\" (Id.); (3)   \"~ad reason to believe that she had been physically violated,\" (Id., pg.\r\n4); and,   (4~'Ye allegedly saw, was aware of and observed these things at that time.\"\r\n(Id.). First, there is nothing whatever \"alleged\" about what Morris did to Ms. Farmer. He\r\n\r\nhas pled guilty to every lurid detail of it under oath! Second, Defendants want to lock\r\n\r\nMs. Farmer into specific recollections, when the thrust of her entire testimony was that\r\n\r\nshe was drugged and completely out of it during her violation and has only the vaguest\r\n\r\n                                              11\r\n\frecollections of it. Such a distortion is especially reprehensible where Morris admitted\r\n\r\nthe sophisticated nature of his carefully plotted and executed drugging of Ms. Framer to\r\n\r\nachieve exactly the intoxication and disorientation Defendants now contend she doesn't\r\n\r\nhave! Third, not only does her testimony support her claims, even Defendants admit\r\n\r\nthat when she was questioned by the FBI, she expressly denied memo~ recollection\r\n\r\nof the pictures taken or what they depicted until the FBI showed\r\n                                                                     ~e~!@\r\n                                                                     ~n to her, (Id., pg.\r\n                                                                    ~\r\ns).                                                             ~\r\n                                              II.             ·~\r\n                          ARGUMENTANDAUTHO~\r\n       Given the truly egregious nature of this      case:~ Farmer and her undersigned\r\ncounsel believe it's both necessary and     approp~«fc, bluntly respond to the defenses\r\nasserted in Defendants' instant M/MSJ,       base~on five (5) critically important issues.\r\n                                               ~\r\nFirst, in Defendants' Motion to        Dismi~(ttey   only infer a two (2) year limitations\r\n\r\ndefense, per Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code      ~~003(a), yet the Court should note how strange\r\nit is that Defendants never once ~at statute, merely discussing case law applying it.\r\n\r\nIf they are so confident of its   ~9-cation, why would they be so coy? Obviously, because\r\nin both law and equity,   ~~3(a) does not apply. Instead, this case is clearly governed\r\nby the provisions of~v. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.0045(a), which provides for an\r\n                     ·~©r\r\napplicable five   ~~ar limitations period, pursuant to which Ms. Farmer's claims are\r\nmanifestly~~ asserted.        Second, even if § 16.003(a) did control, which is not the\r\n\r\ncase, .that statute's two (2) year limitation period has been tolled under the doctrine of\r\n\r\nfraudulent-concealment. Third, even if§ 16.003(a) applied and had been timely asserted\r\n\r\nas a basis for dismissal, neither of which is the case, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\r\n\r\nis not timely, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 91.a3(a). Fourth, in Defendants' Traditional\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               12\r\n\fMotion for Summary Judgment, virtually all of the factual assertions are at stark\r\n\r\nvariance with the appalling \"Factual Basis for Guilty Plea,\" as contained in the Plea\r\n\r\nAgreement Morris has now entered into in his federal criminal prosecution, (Response\r\n\r\nEx. G). The total facts of this case literally cry out for a jury trial of Ms. Farmer's claims.\r\n\r\nFifth, Defendants' attempt to fit this case within the parameters of ~CHRA is a\r\n                                                                  ~@)\r\ncomplete distortion of that law. Ms. Farmer is not making an(Jl'ort of workplace\r\n\r\ncomplaint; she was sexually abused, molested and photograp#ude by Morris, after\r\n\r\nher drugged her unconscious in a hotel room in New J ersel!_f\r\n\r\n       The fact that the instant M/MSJ has been very r~ssionally prepared is a fitting\r\n                                                          ~\r\ntribute to opposing counsel's fine professional    rep~on. But, its glossy polish should\r\nnot in any way distract the Court from the     harib~th\r\n                                                 ~~\r\n                                                        that Morris is a convicted sexual\r\n\r\npredator who, on the one hand, will no     do~ll the federal court how contrite he is at\r\nhis pending February 27,    2015   sentenc~for crimes against Ms. Farmer specifically,\r\nwhile here, he is the same smug, a~ant bully who drugged and abused Ms. Farmer\r\n\r\nand numerous other       victims 1~ and denying as strongly as ever. How utterly\r\ncontradictory that he will b~~doubtedly remorseful to Ms. Farmer in the court where\r\n                            rg~\"'\r\nhe faces federal prison ~ yet, here, he is still denying everything and trivializing Ms.\r\n                      ~\r\nFarmer's humiliati~ his cruel hands. Therefore, Ms. Farmer now addresses each of\r\n\r\nthe forgoing   fi~) issues seriatim, in the fervent hope that this Court will hold\r\nDefendant~~e same accountability here as Morris has been compelled, by the awful\r\nfacts he authored, to submit to in the federal court.\r\n\r\n   A. Ms. Farmer's Claims Are Governed by Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\r\n      16.0045(a)'s Five (5) Year Limitation Period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              13\r\n\f      Ms. Farmer agrees that in her Original Petition on file herein, (Response Ex. A),\r\n\r\nshe has asserted causes of action against Morris based upon the torts of \"intentional\r\n\r\nphysical contact... directly and through the instrumentality of drugs,\" (Id., '1! 10), and\r\n\r\n\"intruding on... seclusion when tak[ing] photographs of [Ms. Farmer] when she was\r\n\r\nunconscious.\" (Id., '1l 12). These were further characterized as claims f~sault, (Id.,     '1f\r\n                                                                   __ e_,rt@\r\nn), and invasion of privacy, (Id., '1!13), as regards Edible. Defendar~ant to take these\r\n\r\nterms at face value, in a factual vacuum, to lock them into   t~~ (2) year limitation\r\nperiod provided by Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.003(a). ~ver, these claims do not\r\n\r\narise from a punch in the nose, a car wreck or a routin~lip-and-fall. They arise from\r\n                                                       o~F\r\ntruly insidious sexual abuse facts which shock     th~nscious.    Therefore, Ms. Farmer\r\n\r\nvigorously asserts that her claims fall more     re~ably\r\n                                                 ~~\r\n                                                         Within the parameters of Civ.\r\n\r\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 16.0045(a), which    p~s for a five (5) year limitation period in\r\ncases involving sexual abuse; and, it is t~longer period which should control here.\r\n\r\n      Defendants cite a number of R@lles regarding the application of§ 16.003(a)'s two\r\n                               ~'f:J\"\"\r\n(2) year limitation period to ~ion of privacy claims, but a close reading thereof\r\n\r\nreveals them to be   disting\"\"'~ble\r\n                           ~·&<\r\n                                    from Ms.     Farmer's instant claims.

However, it was there defied as \"A judicially\r\n\r\napproved defin, of the right of privacy is that it is the right to be free from the\r\n\r\nunwarrant~):propriation or exploitation of one's personality, the publicizing of one's\r\nprivate affairs with which the public has no legitimate concern, or the wrongful\r\n\r\nintrusion into one's private activities in such manner as to outrage or cause mental\r\n\r\nsuffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.\" I d., at 859. What\r\n\r\nhappened to Ms. Farmer is far more egregwus that any of that.

In\r\n\r\nStevenson v.

QJff;\r\n     And, it's particularly interesting to note thq~efendants cite Ramirez v.\r\n                                                 ·~\r\nMansour, No. 04-06-00536-CV, 2007 WL 21871~t *6, (not reported in S.W.3d)\r\n\r\n(Tex.App.- San Antonio Aug. 1, 2007, no        pet,-}~r the proposition that assault and\r\n                                                   ·~\r\nbattery actions are limited by a two-years~ oflimitations, (M/MSJ, pg. 9, n. 39).

Nothing about that case begins to rise to the level of Ms.\r\n\r\nFarmer's   ~        assault claims while she was drugged unconscious. Similarly,\r\n\r\nMarburger v.

And, in stark confirmation of\r\nDefendants' obdurate refusal to acknowledge Ms. Farmer's entire claims, one of the Movants\r\nhere, Morris, has pled guilty to the entire gruesome scope of what Ms. Farmer claims!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     16\r\n\findicating to her at least some degree of penetration, although she did not believe she\r\n\r\nhad been raped, (see Response Ex.

And, the circumstances surrounding her\r\n\r\nviolation and Morris' subsequent arrest absolutely confirm his successful intention to\r\n\r\nrender her unconscious and unable to resist him. Again, in his Ple~reement, he\r\n\r\nexplicitly confessed to such!                                        u\"i\"'-@)\r\n       Thus, while he has not been formally charged         unde~~s      criminal law, his\r\n\r\nfederal criminal conviction is the functional equivalent ~~f. And, justice requires\r\n\r\nthat victims such as Ms. Farmer should be accn~d a reasonably expansive\r\n                                                Q~\r\ninterpretation of the applicable limitations pe11~ instead of applying a rigid\r\n\r\ninterpretation, like an Old English form of      oo~, which distinctly favors a craven\r\n                                                 Q~\r\n\r\npredator like Morris or his enabling     em~,         Edible. And, her invasion of privacy\r\n\r\nclaim is actually a part and parcel of   & sexual violation. Morris took his salacious\r\nliberties with Ms. Farmer while ~ was in a helpless condition and then took\r\n\r\nphotographs of her nude    bodyG~ding close-ups of her vaginal area, as proof of his\r\nsadistic conquest, which   he~· bragged about to his mistress Jackson.

Thus, by reasonable extension a Rule\r\n\r\n91a motion is equally the proper vehicle to assert a limitations defense. Similarly, in\r\n\r\nWooley, 447 S.W.3d at 75-76, the Houston 14th CCA explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              24\r\n\f      \"Although we aclmowledge that Rule 91a motions to dismiss are unique,\r\n      we find them to be analogous to pleas to the jurisdiction, which require a\r\n      court to determine whether the pleader has alleged facts demonstrating\r\n      jurisdiction. See Tex. Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\r\n      217, 225-26 (Tex.2004). In that context, we construe the pleadings\r\n      liberally in favor of the plaintiff, look to the pleader's intent, and accept as\r\n      true the factual allegations in the pleadings to determine if the pleader has\r\n      alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate the trial court's ju~i      diction\r\n      over a claim.

First, have Defenda~aived limitations by failing to timely assert it, by\r\n\r\nmeans of a Rule 91a.3(a) moti#econd, even if not, can Ms. Farmer assert a tolling\r\n\r\nexception to § 16.003(a)? ~\"\\ the answer to both questions is emphatically Yes, the\r\n\r\ninstant Motion to   Dism~~ould be denied.\r\n                     ~\r\n      Prior to the ~~tive date of Rule 91a, (March 1, 2013), Defendants could have\r\n\r\nasserted a limi#ns affirmative defense much like they have attempted here. But,\r\n\r\nunder the   ~~c terms of Rule 91a.3(a), they were procedurally obligated to do so in\r\nconformity therewith. s Factually, such an oversight seems particularly significant\r\n\r\nbecause, since this entire series of appalling events came to light, Morris has steadfastly\r\n\r\n8See Rule 91a.3(a)(motion to dismiss must be filed within \"6o days\" of movant's service with\r\npleading containing allegedly baseless action).\r\n\r\n                                            26\r\n\fdenied every allegation asserted against him. Instead, Defendants now move for\r\n\r\ndismissal ostensibly pursuant to two-year limitations period set out in Civ. Prac. & Rem.\r\n\r\nCode § 16.003(a).9 Such statute does mandate that tort claims based upon \"personal\r\n\r\ninjury\" must be brought \"not later than two years after the day the cause of action\r\n\r\naccrues.\" Id.

Defendants contend Ms. Farmer was aw~of the nude\r\n\r\nphotos of her on the night they were taken, citing a mere\r\n                                                                       R,rfl/! her deposition\r\n                                                                   snip~\r\n\r\ntestimony, (M/MSJ, pg. 15, n. 70 and 71).

In that regard, it is   mos~~s that Defendants cite Bell v. Philadelphia Int'l\r\nRecords, 981 F. Supp. 2d    621,~      (S.D. Tex. 2013), (M/MSJ pgs. 14-15, n. 68). While\r\n\r\nthe Bell court did state that •~laintiffs allegations that a record label misappropriated\r\n                            ©~{P\r\nhis name, image and lil~ss for gain was a claim based on invasion of privacy and that\r\n                       ~\r\nsince he failed to ~nt evidence or argument as to when the claim arose, but the\r\n\r\napparent event#urred \"long ago\", the claim was time-barred, (Id.); the court also\r\n\r\nsaid:   \"Clo~'1!lated to the discovery rule is the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.\r\nUnlike the discovery rule, fraudulent concealment is an equitable doctrine that is fact-\r\n\r\nspecific. Shell Oil Co. v. Ross, 356 S.W.3d 924, 927 (Tex.2011). To invoke this exception,\r\n\r\nBell must show that the defendants 'actually knew a wrong occurred, had a fixed\r\n\r\npurpose to conceal the wrong, and did conceal the wrong.' Id. Even then, '[f]raudulent\r\n\r\n                                               40\r\n\fconcealment only tolls the statute of limitations until \"the fraud is discovered, or could\r\n\r\nhave been discovered with reasonable diligence.\" 'Id. (quoting B.P. Am. Prod. Co. v.\r\n\r\nMarshall, 342 S.W.3d 59, 67 (Tex.2011)).\" Thus, Bell supports the timeliness of Ms.\r\n\r\nFarmer's invasion of privacy claim, even were the Court to decide it was not part and\r\n\r\nparcel of her sexual abuse. She learned of the photos and what they slo~d only after\r\n                                .                                           ;Fv\r\nthe FBI seized them from Morris and showed them to her in           May~2.

This motion is asserted because, despite the ruling\r\n\r\non the summary judgment motion, this Court does not have subject matter      j~~ion over the\r\nclaims assetted in this lawsuit. Because of the Jack of subject matter jurisYon, the case must\r\n                                                                         ~\r\nbe dismissed,                                                        ~r!;j\r\n       The Motion for Summary Judgment relied heavily on the~ Supreme Comt's holding\r\n\r\nin Wafjle House v. Williams, 313 S.W.3d 796, 803 (Tex. 2010),   ~equent to   Wajjle House, there\r\n                                                              ~\r\nhave been several comt of appeals opinions that cited   Q~~t injected a jurisdictional approach\r\nto the analysis in holding for employers in claims0 w!w.re employees assert common law claims\r\n                                                     §:df\r\nthat are pre-empted by specifically written ~ment discrimination statutes. One of these\r\n\r\ncases, Pruitt v. International Association/J!tFire Fighters, 366 S.W. 3d 740 (Tex. App         ~\r\nTexarkana, 2012 (no pet.) took     th~*oach,      holding that in fact patterns such as the ones\r\n\r\nbefore this Court, there is no j t~tion to hear the claims asserted by the Plaintiffs. Pruill\r\n\r\nrelied on several cases that   !~hat a failure to file employment based discrimination claims,\r\nincluding those alleging   ~1lous instances of sexual harassment, with the proper administrative\r\n                      ~\r\nagency (In this case~ Texas Workforce Commission- Civil Rights Division \"TWC-CRD\")\r\n\r\ndeprives the co#Jurisdiction to hear the case.\r\n\r\n       D~ts' Plea to the Comt's Jurisdiction should be granted purely as a matter of law\r\nbecause Plaintiffs have inconectly brought forth common law claims of assault for alleged\r\n\r\nconduct that falls within the scope of the Texas Commission for Human Rights Act's\r\n\r\n(\"TCHRA\") exclusive remedy for workplace sexual harassment. Defendants are cognizant of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 2\r\n\fthe severity of the allegations being asserted by each of the Plaintiffs in tllis suit. Regardless,\r\n\r\neven if the allegations of assault of a sexual nature were ttue, the exclusive remedy lies within\r\n\r\nthe confines of the TCHRA. This co uti has no jurisdiction to bear them because administrative\r\n\r\nprerequisites were circumvented by Plaintiff Ked Hill, or in the case of plaintiffs Michelle\r\n\r\nBarnett and Stacy Stewati, wholly ignored.                                                       ~~\r\n                                         STATEMENTOFFACTS 1      ~U\r\n    I.

In any such case, the plaintiff could\r\n                claim that a physical contact, even if not actionable as statut01y sexual\r\n                harassment, and even if not normally actionable as a common-law battery,\r\n                was 'offensive or provocative' because it occurred in the context and\r\n                course of the coworker's sexual harassment of the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n   Any excuse that the Plaintiffs would advance as an explanation\r\n\r\nrequirements of a TCHRA claim based on the same gravamen would\r\n                                                                                *\r\n                                                                               f~~\r\n                                                                           al~Qem\r\n                                                                                       meeting the\r\n\r\n                                                                                      to circumvent\r\n                                                                        o(b\r\nits unique standards and procedures, including the statutory req~ents of exhaustion of\r\n                                                                     o§@\r\nadministmtive remedies, the relatively shol1 statute of       limitati~~he   limits on compensatory\r\n\r\nand punitive damages, and the requirement that the             ~~ff prove      an abusive working\r\n\r\nenvironment.

In the opinion's\r\nsecond paragraph, the Supreme Colll't makes very clear that it is considering a core question of\r\nfirst impression: \"may a plaintiff recover negligence damages for harassment covered by the\r\nTCHRA?\" 313 S. W.3d at 798-99. Plaintiffs herein bring no such claim. In the very next paragraph,\r\nthe Court admonishes: \"the TCHRA does not foreclose an assault-based negligence claim arising\r\nfrom independent facts unrelated to sexual harassment.\" Id., at 799· Here, Plaintiffs assert assault\r\nclaims against Morris and negligence claims against Edible for allowing a predator to victimize\r\nthem. Neither claim is in any way precluded by the TRCHA or its application in Waffle House.\r\n                                                 2\r\n\fjurisdiction, see Tex. Dep't ofParks & Wildlife v.

The evidentiary facts the Court may and should consider.\r\n\r\n        In their Plaintiffs' Third Amended Petition, the specific      assault~ery      claims\r\n\r\nasserted by the Assault Victims are as follows:                           ~~\r\n   1.   During a November, 2011 trip to New· Orleans, Louisiana,    M~~·ugged Plaintiff\r\n                                                                    ¢~\r\n        Michelle Barnett by putting an unknown substance int~ drink, unbeknownst\r\n                                                                 o@j\r\n        to her. During this time, Morris attempted to ~\"1\\lly assault Barnett and\r\n\r\n        attempted to forcefully remove her clothing, ( P~~ ~ 9);\r\n\r\n   2.   During a January,   2012   h•ip to New York,   N~k, Morris drugged Plaintiff Keri\r\n        Hill by putting an unl<nown substance itlrliJ!r drink, unbeknownst to her. Hill lost\r\n                                                    ~\r\n        consciousness and awoke some fiv~x hours later, having no memory of the\r\n\r\n        intervening time period, (Petitiobn). Later in January,        2012,   during a trip to\r\n\r\n        Chicago, illinois, Morris a~~th_gged Hill by putting an unknown substance into\r\n\r\n        her drink,   unbeknowns~er. This time, she awoke from being unconscious to\r\n        find Morris' face   p1~ against hers        while she was being sexually assaulted,\r\n\r\n        (Petition ,!12);   UQ\r\n   3. During a    M~o11 trip to Boston, Massachusetts, Morris drugged Plaintiff Stacy\r\n        Stewart~tting au unlmovm substance into her drink, unbeknownst to her.\r\n        Wh~~1e was semi-conscious, Morris attempted to sexually assault her and\r\n        attempted to forcefully remove her clothing, (Petition , 14);\r\n\r\n    4· On the basis of these respective factual allegations, eacll and all of said Plaintiffs\r\n\r\n        claimed that Morris, individually, intentionally caused physical contact directly or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                5\r\n\f       through the instrumentality of drugs, while he knew or reasonably should have\r\n\r\n       known that each Plaintiff would find that contact offensive or provocative;\r\n\r\n    5· Further, each Plaintiff claimed against Edible because the basis for each b·ip arose\r\n\r\n       out of Morris' capacity as President and CEO of Edible and the sup,ervisor of each\r\n\r\n       Plaintiff and the company should be held liable for the       intentio~~rtious acts\r\n       of its principal; (Petition ~~ 18-20, inclusive). However, no ~Wtiff asserted any\r\n\r\n       claim against either Morris, individually, or Edible    aris~t of any contention\r\n       of sexual discrimination. Instead, every claim         a~ arises directly out of\r\n       intentionally tortious conduct of Morris and        l;b~xual     assault of each of the\r\n                                                             ~\r\n       victims; and,                                  Qi/lj?\r\n    6. As a result of these several intentional 0 ~al assault torts, each Plaintiff claims\r\n\r\n       damages for: physical pain, suffeef.nd impairment from tlte time of the\r\n\r\n       incidents described through tria&~tal anguish and anxiety from the time of the\r\n\r\n       incidents through trial; men~guish and anxiety to be experienced in the future;\r\n\r\n       and, loss of earnings   a~ing capacity sustained from the date of each incident\r\n       to time of trial.    ~       Plaintiff also seeks exemplary damages for Morris'\r\n\r\n       outrageous, ma~s and intentional conduct, (Petition~~ 21-26, inclusive).\r\n\r\nAnd, each and all   ~Assault Victims' claims and theh· asserted damages are copiously\r\nsupported by    ~ition testimony obtained in the discovety which has thus far been\r\n               cg\r\nundertal~·ein.7\r\n\r\n1 In Defendants' Plea, the deposition transcripts of the three Assault Victims are appended, as\r\nExhibits \"1\", (Barnett), \"2\", (Hill), and \"3\" (Stewart\"). To avoid confusion, the same exhibits are\r\nadopted and incorporated herein by reference, per Tex. R. Civ. P. 58. Citations thereof are to page\r\nand line. As did Defendants, the Assault Victims set out virtually the same factual summary as\r\nwas contained in their Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. They apologize\r\nfor this seeming imposition upon the Court's time and precious judicial resources, but, feel that\r\nfor completeness and ease of analysis such facts are here relevant as well.\r\n                                                6\r\n\f      In her discovery deposition, Plaintiff Michelle Barnett testified that she is a\r\n\r\nJanuary, 2000 graduate of San Francisco State University, with a bachelor's degree in\r\n\r\nhistory, (10:19-24). She lives in Cypress, Texas with her husband and two children, an 8-\r\n\r\nyear-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, (13:13- 14:2). She resigned from Edible late in\r\n\r\nFebruary, 2012, (12:2-5); having been hired in about June, 2011,     (16~1she became\r\naware of the company from use of its software at a prior job, begin~ about January,\r\n\r\n2009, (17:1-10). She interviewed for her job at Edible with De~~t Hemi Morris and\r\n                                                             o@;i;\r\nhis son Trevor, (20:20-23). She began work at Edible~l\\ugust 1st, 2011, as the\r\n\r\nOperations Office Manager, (24:5-8). She understood j~ravel would be a part of her\r\n\r\njob, (27:13-20). Her first trip for the company w~~lanta, in October, 2011, (29:17-\r\n\r\n25); she was accompanied by Morris, Trevm;, ~ Beth Jackson, (30:1-6). Beth was a\r\n\r\nsoftware implementation specialist, (30:7#· Barnett reported to Defendant Morris,\r\n\r\n(30:13-16). They left on the trip on a Fr&, (30:17-24); and, they returned the following\r\n\r\nSunday, (31:4-7), She flew to Atlan~ herself and stayed in a Marriott hotel; the travel\r\n\r\narrangements having been    m~~ someone else, (31:7-16). Trevor, Morris and Beth\r\nwere already there when s~\\rived at the hotel, (32:6-9).\r\n\r\n       Ms. Barnett weUdinner that Friday night with Trevor and Morris, (34:17-25).\r\n\r\nShe had two alcoh~rinks, (35:3-18). She also went to a buffet dinner on Saturday, with\r\n                oU\r\na lot of peopl~n the trade show, (35:25- 36:10); and, there was drinking there too,\r\n              ©1\r\nalthough~ould not remember what she drank or the number of drinks, although she\r\nassumed it was wine or vodka, her usual choices, (36:10- 37:10). These two dinners were\r\n\r\nthe only occasions when she drank alcohol on that trip, (37:15- 38:6). Both Morris and\r\n\r\nTrevor drank at the Friday night dinner, (38:7-16), and at the Saturday buffet, (38:17-20);\r\n\r\nbut, she could not recall what the two men drank at those functions, (38:15-16, 21-22).\r\n\r\n                                             7\r\n\fShe was not under the influence of alcohol on Friday night, (39:2-8); but, on Saturday\r\n\r\nnight, she did, (39:9-10), She felt \"tipsy\", (39:11-12). She was driven back to the hotelfrom\r\n\r\nthe buffet by Morris, (16-19). Trevor was with them and he might have driven, (39:21-\r\n\r\n40:10). But, she was neither drugged nor had any complaints about that trip, (40:16-25).\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to work, everything was fine, (41:6-8).\r\n                                                                            *\r\n                                                                         ~ri/j\r\n       In response to very adroit q~estioning by seasoned opposin~~sel, Ms. Barnett\r\n\r\nadmitted that she had harassment training at the          compan~~:17-22); and if she\r\nobserved it, she was supposed to report it,        (57:5-10). ~~as given a copy of the\r\n\r\ncompany's \\ITitten harassment policy, (67:2-21); and, s~ew who to report problems\r\n\r\nto, (68:18- 69:23). She went to a \"lunch and      lea1Q~t it, (70:1-11). Early in her time\r\nwith the company, (17 days after beginning), &)).~bserved Andrea Farmer at work when\r\n\r\nshe appeared to be intoxicated, and       s~ed Beth about it, (65:12- 66:7). She\r\nunderstood the policy and what       wor~ce        sexual harassment was, which included\r\n\r\nunwanted sexual advance, touc~~~ents, (70:15- 71:8), She understood the policy\r\n\r\napplied to anyone she worked~~ (71:12-23). But, very importantly, she did not feel that\r\n\r\nthe policy had an effect re~'j,ng the president of the company, Morris, (73:25-74:8). In\r\n\r\nfact, she expressly   fel~~ could not be protected if the sexual harassment came from\r\nMorris, (74:19);   s~~r she was attacked in New Orleans, she decided to not to report it\r\nto the compa~ich she believed would be futile, (75:7-16); and, instead she reported\r\n\r\nit to the ~74:23- 75:1). However, even that report was not made until the following\r\n\r\nFebruary, (75:2-3), three month after she was attacked in New Orleans, because it took\r\n\r\nher that long to sum up the courage to do sol\r\n\r\n       In this regard, it is imperative that the Court understand two critical aspects of\r\n\r\nsuch testimony. First, the deposition of Ms. Barnett was not to preserve her trial\r\n\r\n                                              8\r\n\ftestimony; rather it was for discovery pUl'poses only. Undersigned counsel for Ms.\r\n\r\nBarnett reserved all question until time of trial, (281:19-21). Thus, all of her testimony\r\n\r\nwas in response only to the questions opposing counsel artfully chose to ask. Second, even\r\n\r\nso, during her protracted deposition, which began at 9:33am, (6:1), and concluded more\r\n\r\nthan seven hours later at 4:36 pro, (281:25), the magnitude of what    ha~ to her and\r\nthe devastatingly traumatic effect it had upon her come vividly thr~ven in response\r\n\r\nonly to wily interrogation by opposing counsel. In the face of ~right physical attack\r\n\r\nby company president and CEO Morris, all of the normal ru~arding workplace sexual\r\n\r\nharassment went completely out the window.         Therefo~o hold Ms. Barnett to solely\r\nthose rules in analyzing this case can only serve tQvi/fl:a manifestly gross injustice, The\r\n\r\nsuperb skills of opposing counsel in framing      h~inquiries   simply cannot be allowed to\r\n                                                  ~\r\nmask over the horrific nature of Monis'~edations and the injuries it proximately\r\n\r\ncaused.                                 ~\r\n       About two or three weeks a~the Atlanta trip, Ms. Barnett was asked to travel\r\n\r\nagain, in November, 2011,    (4~~:3); this time to New Orleans, (42:4-5). Morris told\r\nher that the purpose of he~ticipation on this trip was to implement software for Aunt\r\n\r\nSally's Pralines,   (42:6~She was excited about the trip because it was her first client\r\nimplementation, ~-22); and, also it was her first trip there, (77:13-17). Morris made\r\n                o(\\J\r\nthe travel   arr~ments, (57:24-25), They departed on November 141h, 2011, in the\r\n              (Ql\r\nafternoo~:17-22); she flew ·with Morris, (58:23-24), on Southwest, (58:25- 59:2). She\r\nthough it was unusual that the trip details were not given to her until just before the trip,\r\n\r\n(59:3-21), She asked Morris about it and he told her not to wony and seemed annoyed\r\n\r\nthat she asked, (59:22- 60:2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              9\r\n\f       They left on a Monday, (60:12-13); she and Morris drove separately from work to\r\n\r\nthe airport, (60:14-25). On the flight to New Orleans, she sat next to Morris, (77:20-25;\r\n\r\n78:22-24; 79:3-9). During that flight both she and Morris had one drink, hers a red wine,\r\n\r\n(79:9-24). Once they arrived, Morris rented a car, (81:25- 82:2), and they drove to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecked them both in, (82:3-25). Then, they went up to their\r\n                                                                          *\r\nMarriot hotel in the French Quarter, (8o:8-2o). When they arrived a~~otel, Morris\r\n\r\n                                                                 res~Qe rooms, on the\r\n                                                                  o(lj\r\nsame floor, (83:1-23). They had rooms on the concierge floor, (~11); and, this was the\r\n\r\nfirst time she had ever been to a concierge lounge,   (81:12-1~ere, the hotel provided a\r\nTV, hor d'oeuvres, and drinks, (81:18-22). By the time   ~~et in the lounge it was early\r\n                                                     >)}l~\r\nevening, (84:2-8); and, they stayed there about 30'V tes or less, (84:9-13). She went to\r\n\r\na setup buffet and obtained some appetizers on~@ate, (84:18-19), and she poured herself\r\n                                              '\"'~\r\na vodka soda drink, (84:20-23), at a self-~catt, (85:2-14). However, she only drank\r\n\r\nabout half of it, (86:16-19).           ~\r\n       That day, before arrivingJR\"'~41ounge, Ms. Barnett had eaten breakfast, a salad\r\n\r\nfor lunch and two bags of   pea~~ the plane, (85:16-25);, then, in the lounge, she had\r\nthe appetizers,   (85:19-21).~e Morris arrived in the lounge, they only stayed there a\r\nshort time,   (86:12-16).~9ris wanted to go to a restaurant for dinner and he made to-go\r\n                    ~\r\ncup drinks to take ~e drive there, (86:19- 87:10). Morris poured the remaitung half on\r\n\r\nher drink into  ~fo-go cup and then he added to it, (87:9-16); and, he prepared a to-go\r\ndrink for~lftoo, (88:4-5). Importantly, Morris took her drink from her to make her\r\n\r\nto-go cup drink, (88:6-9); and, during the time he made it, he went behind her so that she\r\n\r\ncould not see what he was doing, (88:6-20). They did not have reservations, (89:7-18);\r\n\r\nso, they then wentto Mr. B's for dinner, which was across the streetfrom the hotel, (88:19-\r\n\r\n89:6). There was no wait at the restaurant and they were seated immediately, (89:19-25).\r\n\r\n                                            10\r\n\f       Ms. Barnett only had a sip or two of her to-go drink because it was very strong,\r\n\r\n(90:8-11). When they went into the restaurant, the drinks were taken from them, (89:24-\r\n\r\n90:7); so, they ordered more drinks, hers again being a vodka soda, (90:15-18). Up until\r\n\r\nthat time, Manis had done nothing assaultive, (91:25- 92:6); but, near the end oftheir\r\n\r\nmeal, significant events occurred, (93:8-11), During the course of her     di~\"'toth of them\r\ndrank and she consuming a total ofthree drinks, (92:10-24); the  d~Qasting about two\r\nhours, (92:25- 93:1). Near the end of dessert, a waitress asked ~~fthey wanted more\r\n                                                                   o@;J)\r\ndrinks, and she said no, (93:8-14); however, she excused h~o go to the restroom and\r\n\r\nwhen she returned to the table, two drinks were           sit~ere, one for her, (93:14-16;\r\n95:13-16). Morris claimed the waitress had just        br~em, (93:19-24). Since she didn't\r\nwant this new drink, she only had a few sips of~'bJ4:12-24); then she dumped it out into\r\n\r\nher water glass, (94:21-25; 95:17-24), bec~e didn't want it, (95:22-25).\r\n       Then, they left to walk on          Bou~ Street to look at the      customer's building,\r\n\r\n(96:20-24); but they never got th~doing into a piano bar called PJ's instead, (96:25-\r\n\r\n97:7). (She later corrected        t!Q~e to Pat O'Brien's, (145:15- 146:2)).Going in was\r\nMorris' idea, (97:8-21); sh~tipsywhen they arrived there, (97:22-24). Morris ordered\r\n\r\nmore drinks even      tho~1fe did not ask her if she wanted one of, if she did, what kind,\r\n                  ~\r\n(98:18-25), The dt~he received, she later learned, was a \"Hurricane\", (99:1-15). She\r\n                 nq;~G                 .\r\ndidn't refuse   ~'e;;lft•ink,   but she felt Morris was intentionally trying to get her to drink\r\n\r\nmore tha~vanted to, (99:20- 100:4), because she had specifically told him at the end\r\n\r\nof dinner that she didn't want to drink more because they had to see the elient in the\r\n\r\nmoming, (100:5-10). But, she felt compelled to dt·ink more at the piano bar because she\r\n\r\nwas with her boss and she was trying to \"go along\", (100:17-21; 101:19-23). The Hmricane\r\n\r\nwas a very big drink, (100:22- 101:8); and, she didn't !mow he was ordering it and\r\n\r\n                                                  11\r\n\ftherefore didn't have a chance to say she didn't want it, (102:6-21). Once it came, she a\r\n\r\nthird to a half ofit, (103:6-7), because it was very \"alcohol intensive\", (103:8-13); but, even\r\n\r\nso, while she was again in the restroom, Morris ordered another one, (103:16-23). This\r\n\r\ntime, she told him directly she didn't want another and asked him why he had ordered it,\r\n\r\n(104:21-24); in response, he told her to drink the new, full Hurricane     a~ moved the\r\nhalf-full one away from her, (104:25- 105:3)!                          ~a\r\n                                                       s~~ compelled to drink\r\n       She again told him she didn't want it, (105:6-8); but,\r\n\r\nsome of it and she drank about a quarter of it, (106:2-~e later learned tbat tbe\r\n\r\nprinciple alcohol in such drinks is Bacardi 151 proof ru~o6:7-17); and, she could not\r\n\r\nrecall ever before having drunk such potent    alcoh~~:l-6). She has no recollection of\r\nleaving the piano bar; she can only remember ani'llrm pulling her out of her chair and that\r\n                                                 {!?\r\nis the last thing she remembers, (105:17~08:9-13). Later, she discovered the next\r\n\r\nmorning tbat it was Morris, who had p~ on her arm, (108:18-23). The next thing she\r\n\r\nremembers is Morris pulling he~~er off, (109:19-22); then, she remembers running\r\n\r\nto the bathroom in her hotel~ to throw up, (110:1-5; 110:25- 111:3). She remembers\r\n\r\nsaying, 'Oh, this isn't hap~g to me.\" (111:7-9); and she remembers someone pulling\r\n\r\nher clothing off and sh@fearful for her safety, (111:10-14). But, she doesn't have a vivid\r\n\r\nrecollection of   ~~g else, (116:10-12). And, it is here that the real horror of her\r\nexperience   b~es       exquisitely clear. This good and decent woman was rendered\r\n\r\nincohere~~the intentional drugging of Morris; and, she is left now to forever wonder\r\nabout what vile things he did to her while she was unconscious. Did he rape her? Sodomize\r\n\r\nher? Photograph her naked as he did others? Share those salacious photos with others?\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are extensive and the implications foul and odious. And, despite\r\n\r\nDefendants' persistent assertions to the contrary, her awful victimization is not erased\r\n\r\n                                               12\r\n\fbecause she has no memory of it; in the same way that a surgeon's malpractice blunders\r\n\r\nare not negated by the fact that the patient was asleep when his tort occurred!\r\n\r\n       In the morning, she called her husband, (116:13-15). She told him about the\r\n\r\nprevious evening and that she felt uncomfmtable and didn't want to go see the client,\r\n\r\n(117:12-15). Her husband advised her to go to the client's in a   separa~~nd to write\r\nwhat she could remember down and to tell Morris that what had ha~gd made her very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable, (117:18- 118:1); which she did, (118:2-3).   Lat~ notes upset her so\r\n                                                      oci@\r\nmuch she threw them out, (118:4- 119:3). Opposing coun~essed Ms. Baxnett about\r\n\r\nwhy she didn't call 911 or otherwise report that night; h~e said she couldn't be sure a\r\n\r\ncrime had been committed, 122:3-23); and, she     ~nted to go home and make the\r\nevening go away, (123:12-18). But, she didn't gg~me immediately; she prepared herself\r\n                                                  ~\r\nfor the day ahead even though she didn't ~o, (123:19- 124:25); and, then she texted\r\n\r\nMorris that she was uncomfortable ab~he previous night and she wanted to go home\r\n\r\nand would get herself to the airpo~~h5:1-4; 126:10). Morris' breathtakingly deceitful\r\n\r\nresponse was to show up     im~ly at her door indicating that he was very unhappy,\r\n(126:11-25)! He knocked ~r door, but at first she didn't answer because she wanted\r\n\r\nhim to go away,     (127:~but, he kept knocking \"like forever\", (127:4-5). Through the\r\ndoor, she told   him~~ away, (127:11-14); but, as she entered the hallway with her packed\r\nbag, he was   st~e, so she had to talk to him, (127:13-25),\r\n       81~ him she was uncomfortable and wanted to go home, (127:25- 128:5); she\r\nwas not 100% sure it had been Morris; but, she felt that he had assaulted her and tried to\r\n\r\nruin her clothing, (128:13-25). She was certain she was with him and left the piano bar\r\n\r\nwith him, (129:1); and, she felt he had done this to her, (129:7-9). In response to her\r\n\r\ndiscomfort, suave predator that he is, he told her he didn't understand her concern\r\n\r\n                                             13\r\n\fbecause she had come to his room and laid in his bed, where he didn't touch her, (129:18-\r\n\r\n20); but, she adamantly disagreed with this version of the events because she didn't even\r\n\r\nknow where his room was, (129:21-24; 131:9-14); and, she told him so, (131:6-14). He\r\n\r\nresponded that he \"respected her and didn't want to lose her\", 131:15-18). Very\r\n\r\ninterestingly, Morris gave her back the sweater he had taken         o~~ffering no\r\nexplanation as to why he had it, (136:14-19). He asked her to go see it,Yient, and though\r\n\r\n                                                          ~he did, (132:11-12).\r\nshe didn't want to, she finally agreed to do so, (132:1-10);\r\n\r\nHowever, because of their conversation tlley were late arr~t the client's, so Morris\r\n\r\nlied and said tlley had problems getting the car out oft~rage, (134:1-7).\r\n\r\n       Defendants, just as they did in their MSJ,   ~~uch of the fact that Ms. Bamett\r\ntestified that her claims against Morris arise ftQ~ns role as her supervisor in the course\r\n                                              ~\r\nand scope of employment, (137:18-21); b~ectfully, she is not a legal expert and has\r\n\r\nno basis to make such a legal assertion~ey also focus on her testimony that her claims\r\n\r\nconcern her employment and M~$~onduct in a work context, (198:11-16); but, again,\r\n\r\nshe is not qualified to make   s~etermination. Ms. Barnett is the highly traumatized\r\nvictim of a vicious assault ~1e is not a qualified expe1t on Texas or federal employment\r\n\r\nlaw. Moreover, Defen~9offer not one word of explanation as to how drugging a woman\r\n                    ~\r\nat dinner for pu~s of sexual molestation relates in any conceivable way to job\r\n               o(!:J'\r\nperformance ~~rkplace conditions; for the obvious reason that it does not.\r\n\r\n       W~e returned home, she talked to her husband, (145:7-9); because she just\r\ncouldn't understand how she went from being in control of herself to having no\r\n\r\nrecollection, (145:10-14). She decided then she needed to look for another job, (146:8-14);\r\n\r\nand, she began to look for one, (146:15-16). She liked Beth Jackson, but didn't trust her\r\n\r\nand tlley did not discuss what happened, (147:22- 148:10); and, she not discuss it with\r\n\r\n                                            14\r\n\fany other Edible employees until a few weeks later, when she talked with a new employee,\r\n\r\nErin Bjork, (148:11-22). She specifically told her she thought she had been drugged and\r\n\r\nthat Morris had attempted to sexually assault her, (149:25- 150:18). She also told her\r\n\r\nhusband that, (150:19-21). She made no attempt to preserve a urine sample or other\r\n\r\nevidence because she just didn't have the opportunity to do so,\r\n\r\nfurther conversations with Morris about the matter until about\r\n                                                                         *\r\n                                                                   (151:~. She had no\r\n                                                               a~M later, which he\r\ninitiated, (153:21-25); he said he was concerned for her and ~~plied she was fine,\r\n                                                            o!?@\r\n(154:1-7). A similar exchange occurred on another occasio~4:8-14). She just tried to\r\n\r\navoid him, (155:11-19), unless contact with him was re~®a, (155:20-22).\r\n\r\n      Ms. Barnett never discussed the matter     wi~v employee Michelle Byrd, who\r\ndealt with sexual harassment matters,   becau~~e     felt it would be unsafe to do so as\r\n\r\nMorris was the company president, 158:~9:2); thus the anti-harassment plan was\r\n\r\n\"unsafe\" for her, (159:9-24). She thougl~e idea that Morris would lose his job while she\r\n\r\nkept hers was ridiculous,   (159:3-~ owned the company and she was a hireling, and\r\nany complaint she made wo4e gone directly to him, (160:1-24). After Morris had\r\n\r\nbeen arrested for the    cri~~ charges against him,    (including one flowing from her\r\n\r\ncomplaint), she told   M~~nk Lettieri, with her former employer, what happened to her,\r\n                   ~\r\n(163:4-8). After r~ng her assault to the FBI, she had a difficult time, (170:6-7). But,\r\n\r\nshe couldn't j~it until she found another job because she couldn't afford it, (172:21-\r\n\r\n173:1). L~~en she did quit, she needed family assistance to make ends meet, (187:15-\r\n\r\n22). She finally talked to Keri Hill about her assault, at the suggestion of Erin Bjorl<,\r\n\r\n(173:8-16). Their mutual allegations were remarkably similar: both traveled with Morris\r\n\r\nearly in their tenure with the company; both met Morris in a hotel concierge lounge; both\r\n\r\nreceived to-go cups from him, containing drinks he had mixed; both completely lost their\r\n\r\n                                            15\r\n\fmemories; both had no history of excessive drinking; and, both were terribly\r\n\r\nuncomfortable about what happened to them, (174:14-25; 175:1-6). Ms. Hill specifically\r\n\r\ntold her about Morris pressing his face to hers and telling her what a good employee she\r\n\r\nwas and that he wanted her to be with him for a long time, (175:11-14). However, even\r\n\r\nwhen she resigned fl'Om the company, she did not give the attack as a ~~because she\r\nfeared for her physical safety, (190:7-16).                          ~U\r\n       After she left the company, she sought unemployment ~s and told the Texas\r\n\r\nWorkforce Commission she had been a crime victim,           ~4-24),       (not a victim of\r\n\r\nworkplace discrimination). She told them all she coulcb~mber, (193:22-194:6); she is\r\n\r\nnow certain she was drugged by Morris because      sQ~consciousness and later when he\r\nwas arrested, blackout drugs were reported in~ news to be on him, (194:18- 195:19).\r\n                                               ~\r\nAgain, opposing counsel pressed Ms. Bar~ the fact that she really has no memOl'y of\r\n\r\nwhat happened to her, (199:4-     200:1~ut, that speaks to the efficacy of his assault\r\ntechnique, it doesn't negate its oai{Vce or legitimate claims arising therefrom. Indeed,\r\n\r\nshe eloquently explained tha~ day since the attack, she has suffered panic attacks,\r\n\r\nanxiety, fear, panic, bein~~~mt from her family, having to think about this \"shit\" every\r\n\r\nsingle day and not   b~~ere for her children when they need her, (201:12-21; 204:6-\r\n            .        ~·\r\n20); for whiCh s~~s seen the FBI counselor, (203:1- 204:3). She has also lost work,\r\n\r\n(204!23-25).~~efore,         her testimony completely supports the prima facie\r\n\r\nassaultf~y claims she herein asserts.\r\n       Plaintiff Keri Hill testified in her eight and a half hour long discovery deposition,\r\n\r\n(in which undersigned counsel for Ms. Hill again reserved all questions until time of trial),\r\n\r\nin relevant part, that she lives in Houston, v.1th her husband and two children, a 13-year-\r\nold son and a 5-year-old daughter, (5:15- 6:8). She graduated from Texas Tech University\r\n\r\n                                              16\r\n\fwith a bachelor's degree in social work, (27:14-23; 28:4-5). She left her employment at\r\n\r\nEdible on April 30, 2012, (20:3-8); and, did not find a new job until August 2, 2012,\r\n\r\n(18:10-12). She first learned of a job at Edible in November, 2011, (31:13-15). Slightly later,\r\n\r\nshe had an interview and met Defendant Morris, (37:10-15). They hired her, but before\r\n\r\nshe began worldng there, on December 12, 2011, (40:3-4), she            att~their office\r\nChristmas party, (39:17-25). There was drinldng at the party,(43:1~~~.\r\n       About a month after she began worldng there, a u·ip to ~qork came up, (45:9-\r\n                                                                o@;j)\r\n19). Morris made all the travel arrangements, (48:6-7). ~ flew to New York on a\r\n\r\nSunday, (50 :12-14), and she drove herself to the airport~~et Morris in the Continental\r\n\r\nPresident's Club, (50:21- 51:5). She got to the   airp~~ and ate lunch by herself, (51:10-\r\n17). As soon as they entered the VIP lounge, 1~s ordered two Bloody Marys, (52:1-5);\r\n\r\nMorris obtained the drinks at a bar and ~ht hers to her, (52:10-15). The choice of\r\n\r\ndrinks was Morris', (53:7-12); and, she ~nd up drinking two of them, over about 30-45\r\n\r\nminutes, both ordered by Morri~~6- 55:1). She also ate a plate of snacks during that\r\n\r\ntime, (55:2-4). On the    plane,~    sat next to Henri in first class, (55:7-10); as he had\r\n\r\nupgraded her to ticket,   (5~0). During the flight, she drank two vodka and cranberry\r\ndrinks, 57:22- 58:9);   ll[~espite having four drinks during that day, she felt fine, (58:6-\r\n12), as she also   at~~al\r\n                   o{»\r\n                          during the flight, (58:13-25).\r\n\r\n       When ~~ane landed, they obtained a rental car, (59:10- 60:12); which Morris\r\n\r\ngot to pi~~d in doing so she felt he was showing off, (60:16- 61:9). Then, they drove to\r\n\r\na Marriott hotel, which was so close to the airport she thought it would have been just as\r\n\r\neasy to walk there from the airport, (61:15- 62:1). When they checked in, Morris was very\r\n\r\njovial, knew many of the employees by name and went behind the counter to hug several\r\n\r\npeople, (63:3-8); from this she assumed he traveled there a lot, (63:20-24). During such,\r\n\r\n                                               17\r\n\fMorris advised her that Beth Jackson would also be arriving, (63:8-17), He checked both\r\n\r\nof them in, (64:11-20); they had rooms on the same floor, (64:21-22). They got to their\r\n\r\nrooms at about 5 pro, (65:13-15). Since she had never been to Manhattan before, Morris\r\n\r\nsaid he would drive her there for diner, (65:18- 66:23). She wanted to see the lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad time, (68:10-24). Weirdly, there was a single photo of it in\r\n                                                                          *\r\nCenter skating rink, (67:10-20).; and, since there was business plann~t night, they\r\n\r\n                                                                   he~Yne the next day,\r\nbut, she had no memory of being there, (111:1- 5).              ·~\r\n                                                                ~\r\n                                                           ..~~\r\n       Before dinner, Ms. Hill called her husband to tell ~e had arrived safely and\r\n\r\nthat they were going into the city to eat at a deli, (69: 1•~and, she also talked with her\r\n\r\nkids, (70:3-7). After that, as instructed, she met   ~in the hotel's concierge lounge,\r\n(70:22). There were a Jot of snacks there and sh&li1•anted some; but, Morris told her not\r\n                                                  ~&\r\nto fill up because they wonld be eating a b~er, (71:16-22). Dming that time, Morris\r\n\r\nordered two vodl{a and cranberry and ~ixed both his and hers and handed her drink\r\n\r\nto her, (71:21-25), She drank abo];!t~# of her drink, (72:14-15); when Morris told her it\r\n\r\nwas time to leave for dinner,   ~~went up to the bar and got two to-go cups, (72:16-\r\n25). He said the cups won~em take their drinks in the car, (73:1-4), Importantly, he\r\n\r\ntook her half-empty   d~from her and replaced it 11oith a new drink which she didn't\r\n                  ~\r\nwant and didn't a~r; then he turned his back to her and made the to-go cup drinks\r\n\r\nwhile she coul#see what he was doing, (73:7-11). She knew drinking in a car was not a\r\n\r\ngood ide~he said she wouldn't have done it herself, but, she was 11oith her boss in a\r\n\r\nnew job, so she didn't protest about it, (73:22- 74:24). Morris brought three cups, on\r\n\r\nwhich he had written his name on one, her name on another and \"spare\" on the third,\r\n\r\nwhich struck her as ve1y odd, (74:25-75!4). Morris carried two and she carried her own,\r\n\r\n(75:8-10); and, they walked to the ear, (75:11- 76:1). She had two sips from her drink\r\n\r\n                                             18\r\n\fduring this walk, (76:2-7). After that, she has absolutely no recollection of the entire\r\n\r\nevening, until she remembered trying to get out of the car back at the hotel, much later,\r\n\r\nand trying to find her room, (77:1-19). She has a vague recollection of getting into the car\r\n\r\nand the car moving, but none of anything else that night, (78:2-25).\r\n\r\n       She has a one-two second flash memory of trying to get out      of~' (79:9-18).\r\n                                                              (79:2~-f. She remembers\r\nShe can't recall eating or drinking anything that entire night,\r\n\r\ntrying to find her room because she felt uncomfortable and lo~~ couldn't figure out\r\n\r\nwhere she was, (80:1-13). She felt like a little ldd who was ~and dreaming; saying, \"I\r\n\r\nhad zero ability or control over what was happening, a~ remember that I don't know\r\n\r\nwhere I was, but I remember that I wet my     panQ~5-10). The next recollection she\r\nhas is standing in her hotel room, with    Mo~~tanding       over her saying he had been\r\n\r\nlooking for her, (82:15-20). She had no~ how he got into her room, (82:21-22).\r\n\r\nOpposing counsel asks her if it is true tl~orris was expressing concern for her, and she\r\n\r\nagrees that this is what he said, ~V 84:6); but, with due respect to opposing counsel\r\n\r\nfor doing his job, the total pict~~ich emerges from this nightmare is horrific. Ms. Hill,\r\n\r\na wife, mother and     colle~duate, on her first company trip, has been reduced to a\r\nterrified, confused,   in~qnent mess because she was drugged into insensibility; and,\r\nhere is her   attacl~~pressing his crocodile tear concern for the awful predicament he\r\n                 0~\r\nhas malicious~tentionally put her in! Bluntly, it's difficult to imagine a more fiendish\r\n\r\nexploita~~ trust or the dignity of another human being. Moreover what he did to her\r\non still another trip only confirms her darkest fears of what he did to her on this one.\r\n\r\n       Ms. Hill remembers asking him to leave, (84:14-15); he responded by telling her to\r\n\r\nsit on the bed and watch TV with him so she would feel better, (84:16-21). She refused\r\n\r\nand asked him again to leave, and he did. (85:5-8). But, he likely did so because by then,\r\n\r\n                                             19\r\n\fshe had her husband on the phone, (85:9-13). She was later told by him that she said\r\n\r\nMorris was in her room and she had walked into the bathroom because she felt very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable that he wanted to stay to watch TV. Her husband told her to ask Morris to\r\n\r\nleave; but, she has no direct memory ofthat conversation, (85:14-25). At that point, she\r\n\r\ndidn't feel physically violated or in danger, (86:14-25); but the next   ~~~g, Monday,\r\nMorris made a comment about her drinking the previous          evenin~Y she felt terribly\r\nembarrassed that she had ruined her new job, (89:2-6); so,       ~pologized profusely,\r\n                                                               0~\r\n(89:7-8; 89:22- 90:3; 90:16-19). Morris told her he had~\"Relp her walk around the\r\n\r\nprevious evening, but, she had no memory of that,      (89•~~·\r\n      After breakfast, they went to see the client,   ~~24); and, she was functional that\r\nday, (93:17-20). Late that afternoon, they   retu~:o the hotel and Morris decided he\r\n                                               ~\r\nwanted to take her back into Manhattan a~or dinner, which he did, (94:3-11). Before\r\n\r\nthey went, she again talked to her hus~ and apologized as she had never before had\r\n\r\nan \"alcohol issue\" before,    (94:~~).      Her husband was perplexed about what had\r\n\r\nhappened because that was n~bo she was\", (95:10-21). Even then, she didn't believe\r\n\r\nMorris was responsible fo~ previous night, (95:22- 96:1); but after her trip with him\r\n\r\nto Chicago, she   compW~ changed her mind, (96:2-6), However, that second night in\r\nManhattan was     tl.~ntfnl, (96:24- 97:12); although when he again brought up the\r\n                o\\0)\r\nprevious   eve~~ she told him what happened to           her was scary as it was so out of\r\n\r\ncharact~~er,        (97:17-21), Also, while she did agree to have a beer in the concierge\r\n\r\nlounge, Morris offered to make her stronger drinks a couple of times which this time she\r\n\r\nflatly refused, (98:10-18).\r\n\r\n       The next day they worked with another client and Beth ,Tackson arrived at the\r\n\r\nairport late that day and theywentto pick her up, (102:23-103:16). She met Beth the first\r\n\r\n                                             20\r\n\ftime then, (103:20-21). That evening, she, Morris and Beth met in the hotel restaurant for\r\n\r\ndinner; but, during the meal, Morris left and when he retumed, he had drinks he said he\r\n\r\ngot from the concierge lounge, which she again thought was vety odd, (105:23- 106:6,\r\n\r\n106:23-25). She left the next morning by herself and didn't see Morris again until later\r\n\r\nthat week, (107: 10-19).                                                   '*\r\n                                                                        ~([7$\r\n       Her next trip with Morris was to Chicago, to meet a client i~~ria, (108:12-20).\r\n\r\nHe initially asked Erin Bjork to go; but, she refused, (109:8-18)~~s. Hill volunteered,\r\n                                                              0   \"@,\r\n(109:19-110:18). This trip was in February and they flew o~tnwest, (113:6-12). At the\r\n\r\nairport, she ate lunch and had a beer, (114:4-17). She ~rum and coke on the plane,\r\n\r\n(115:5-6), and Morris had a drink too, (116:3-4).#when she went to the restroom,\r\n\r\nMorris ordered her another drink and was po~ it into a new cup when she returned,\r\n                                              ~\r\n(117:8-21). After that, she has no more r~ctions of the rest of the day, (119:10-16),\r\n\r\nexcept that she could recall that the ne,~ink looked \"muddy\" or \"foggy\" and that Morris\r\n\r\npoured it really quickly and hand~e first cup off to the flight attendant, (119:19-23;\r\n\r\n120:3-15; 120:24). She     finally~ to be conscious of her surroundings again about 10\r\npm that night, (121: 20-25~ has flash memories of Morris had her hands intertwined\r\n\r\nor locked together wit~ris', (122: 1-6); and, this may have happened a couple of times,\r\n\r\n(123:1-2). She   als~embers Morris' face being pressed against the side of her face and\r\nher feeling   v~~comfortable physically and emotionally. He told her she had a long\r\ncareer a~t she was a valuable member of his team, and he \"had ahold of my hand\r\n\r\nthat was nowrubbingin my vaginal area as well as up and down my leg.\" (123:9-20; 124:1-\r\n\r\n8). This contact was outside of her clothing, (123:24-25). During this attack, she got\r\n\r\nphysically sick several times and she felt the need to try to get up and get away from where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             21\r\n\fshe was, and she again felt like a little kid, (124:19-25). When his face was pressed agaulSt\r\n\r\nhers, she also recalled seeing a square condom packet, (132:1-7).\r\n\r\n       This time, she was certain she had been drugged because she was on a business\r\n\r\ntrip in the daytime and she got on a plane to go to Peoria, yet she was there without any\r\n\r\nmemory of how she got there; and it definitely was not a dream or      nigh~(125:7-20).\r\nShe firmly believes her drink was drugged, (126:9-10). And,  a~JlVrorris' criminal\r\nattorney, Chip Lev.>is admitted in a news broadcast that MolT~~s arrested with such\r\n\r\ndrugs on his person, (126:20-25). Her next recollection w~g in her hotel room and\r\n\r\nMorris was there too and a to-go cup was on her dres~~he asked Morris to leave and\r\n\r\nhe did so, (129:17-23). Based upon his         druggi~~ on the flight on this trip, she\r\nconcluded that he had drugged her before in th~ew York concierge lounge before they\r\n                                                  ~\r\nwent to dinner, (130:14-24). The govern~ld her that tests confirmed such drugs on\r\n\r\nMorris' person, (131:10-16).                ~\r\n       The next day was spentwi~client, (135:9-10); and throughout the day, Morris\r\n\r\nmade several sarcastic      comme~at the trip took a long time because \"they had to stop\r\nseven times\" for her, (135~). That night, they went to dinner \\lith the client and she\r\n\r\nhad a glass of wine,   (~~19). On the way to dinner, Morris grabbed her hand and she\r\npulled it back   qui~ecause she felt extremely uncomfortable and he told her she was\r\nbeing silly,   (1f:'9:).   Then, as they entered the restaurant, he told her he would hold her\r\n\r\nhand du~nner under the table, but she ignored him, (137:18-23). When they got back\r\n\r\nto the hotel, he asked her to go to the casino. When she refused, he got very frustrated and\r\n\r\nsarcastic and began whining and pouting that he would have to sit by himself, so she\r\n\r\nrelented and said she would have one drink with him, (138:6-15). They went into a bar\r\n\r\nand Morris ordered two drinks; but, when they came, he took them behind a dessert menu\r\n\r\n                                                22\r\n\fwith his back to her, so she walked over and got her drink, a glass of wine, and sat down.\r\n\r\nHe was on the phone. (138:16- 139:5). She was worried he might do something to it,\r\n\r\n(139:10-15). She knew at that point that something was seriously wrong, but she had\r\n\r\ntrouble \"getting her head around it\", (139:16-23).\r\n\r\n       Even so, she was scared to report what had happened,     (140:4~~d, she was\r\nvery confused and trying hard to make sense of what had   actu~appened to her,\r\n(140:17-22). However, she told her husband about it when sh~ome, (140:11-16). In\r\n\r\nthe meantime, she went with Morris back to Chicago fro~·ia to see another client,\r\n\r\n(141:2-25); and, there were no more problems,        (142~®). When she did talk to her\r\nhusband, he saw a bruise on her arm; but, she    tolQ~he hit a wall because she ·wanted\r\nto \"wrap my head around a much bigger conve~tion that I knew we were going to have\r\n                                              ~\r\nto have,\" (143:12-15). She first noticed th~se when she awoke in Peoria the morning\r\n\r\nafter her bizarre previous day,   (144:7~. Finally, she and her husband discussed the\r\nmatter frankly, (15-17). They m~~unch and she told him she was ve1y upset about\r\n\r\nhaving major memmy losses ~o successive business trips, (145:3-11). He told her that\r\n\r\nwhen they talked on the ~ while she apparently was in the car ·with Morris enroute\r\n\r\nto dinner, her        r?.r;»\r\n                 speec~as      slurred and he was astonished at the extent of her ve1y\r\n                  ~\r\nuncharacteristic ~dng, if that was what the problem was; and even then he told her\r\n\r\nshe might ha «f-in drugged, (145:15- 146:1). She had no recollection of even having that\r\n          ~\r\nphone c~~ation, (146:4-13).\r\n\r\n       She then told her husband all the rest that had happened in both New York and\r\n\r\nChicago; and, he became very sad and upset and suggested that she discuss the matter\r\n\r\nwith a friend of theirs who is a narcotics investigators with the Houston Police\r\n\r\nDepartment, (146:15-24). She did have that conversation and was referred to the FBI,\r\n\r\n                                            23\r\n\f(147:16- 148:9). As a result of that, a sting was arranged with her at the Houston airport,\r\n\r\nso Morris could be arrested, (149:23- 150:3). Not surprisingly, the day after Morris was\r\n\r\narrested, she was placed on leave of absence and less than two weeks later, she was fired,\r\n\r\n(154:23- 155:13). Needless to say, her abrupt termination for reporting Morris' repeated,\r\n\r\ndepraved violations of her stands as profound and eloquent             ~on          of her\r\n\r\napprehensions about ever reporting Morris' conduct. She believ~Wt would be both\r\n\r\npointless and dangerous and she was absolutely right! Since th~~cidents, Ms. Hill has\r\n                                                              o~ci@\r\nsuffered lots of anxiety, panic attacks and \"fear of movem~\"tts7:11-16).\r\n\r\n       Both Monis' civil and criminal lawyers pressed~ Hill for long hours on many\r\n\r\ndetails surrounding these matters; but, while     De~~~s seized upon various aspects of\r\nher answers in their MSJ and continue to do SQ~ the instant Plea, they at the very most\r\n                                                ~\r\npresent only a broad range of relevant fa~out which reasonable minds could differ.\r\n\r\nMs. Hill has pt·esented more than eno~testimony to support her prima facie liability\r\n\r\nallegations.

The meeting lasted an hour and she also met Trevor Morris and Beth\r\n\r\nJackson, (23:14-18); and, she understood travel would be required in this job, (23:3-10).\r\n\r\n                                             24\r\n\fShe was offered the job there and she accepted, (24:3-10); and, this was in late February,\r\n\r\n2011, (24:12-20).\r\n\r\n       Her testimony in regard to her abuse by Morris is a bit curious in that opposing\r\n\r\ncounsel chose to question her in the context of what she told the FBI when she was\r\n\r\nsubsequently interviewed by them about it; so in transcripted form     i~third-party\r\nfeel. But, in that contest, she stated that she travelled to Boston wit~J·ris to attend the\r\n                                                                  0~\r\nBoston Seafood Show, (46:1-8), on March 18, 2011,          (57:3-~   she went at Morris'\r\n\r\ninvitation, (57:12- 58:8). Morris made all of the travel   ~ments, 59:10-15). They\r\nstayed in a Maniott hotel while there, (61:2-6). At     ~~ouston airport, she drank a\r\nTanqueray & tonic, (62:14-21); and, during the     fl~Boston, she had a glass of wine,\r\n(61:24- 65:7).                                    §!P\r\n       After she arrived in Boston, she ~orris in the lobby and they checked in\r\n\r\ntogether, (63:3-6); then, as   instructed~~met him in the hotel's concierge lounge for\r\ndrinks, (63:10-16). There, she n~~ris, Beth Jackson and Beth's mother, who lives in\r\n\r\nthe Boston a1•ea, {64:2-10 ). S~ another Tanqueray & tonic, (64:8-11). She made that\r\n\r\ndrink herself; but, a short\"'~\"' later Morris made her another one and brought it to her,\r\n                         g~:~;f'''\r\n(64:22- 65:3), She als~ some snacks, (65:19-20; 66:2-4), Then, they went to dinner at\r\n                   ~\r\nLegal Seafood, (~-21). At dinner, she had a glass of wine, (67:8-9). They left the\r\n\r\nrestaurant   at~ 8:45pm because she wanted to walk to an adjacent mall to buy a shirt\r\nbefore t~es closed, (67= 12- 68 :2). From then on, her recollections were very sketchy,\r\n\r\n(69!15-70:1).\r\n\r\n       The next morning, she woke up with a severe hangover, (46:18-19; 47:3-6); and,\r\n\r\nshe went to a nearby mall to look for a Colee and some food to make herself feel better,\r\n\r\n{52:14-16). She explicitly stated that her hangover was caused by Morris' drugging her by\r\n\r\n                                             25\r\n\fputting something in her drink, (73:3-24; 73:25- 75:7). Her hangover felt like she had\r\n\r\nbeen run over by a truck, (75:8-13). She did not see Morris put the substance in her drink,\r\n\r\n(83:25- 842); but, she is certain that he did, (84:3-7).\r\n\r\n       Later that morning, she attended the food show, which lasted all day, (85:3- 86:9).\r\n\r\nWhen they all returned to the hotel, they, (meaning herself, Morris,    ~~ackson and\r\nanother man), again gathered in the concierge lounge, (87:4-    88:~Kere, she had two\r\nTanqueray & tonics, (88:11-17). Manis made the second      dr~ut of her sight and\r\nbrought it to her, (89:4-9; 89:23- 90:4). Then, they went ~~er at a pizza restaurant,\r\n\r\n{90:4-10). Beth's mother joined them at dinner,      (90~>~). There was no drinking at\r\ndinner, (90:22-25); and, she could recall that     s~~·ned to the hotel where Morris\r\ninstructed her to join him in the bar while he :~he others to \"go ahead\", (91:2-9). They\r\n\r\nhad a conversation during which Morris t~r how important she was to the company,\r\n\r\n(92:10-14); then, the conversation turn~~irdlyto another woman's breasts, (92:15-18).\r\n\r\n       Then, Morris went to    ge~~~ for them at the bar; and, after he returned,        he\r\n\r\nbegan to massage her should~92:18-21). This was out of the blue, (48:17-20; 11-14);\r\n\r\nand, it mad.e her very unc~~rtable. But, before she could protest about it, he stopped,\r\n\r\n(49:17-20). Later,   wh~ywent up to their respective rooms, Manis asked if he could\r\n                 ~\r\ncome into her roo~ continue the massage, (44:19- 45:4; 46:1-6; 51:3-9; 93:13-18). She\r\n\r\nquickly   decli~d Morris left, (51:10-15); although she thinks he may have tried to get\r\ninto her~' (93:21-25). During that evening, she had two Tanqueray & tonic drinks,\r\n\r\nboth of which Morris brought to her, (46:9- 47:2). The next morning, she again awoke\r\n\r\nwith a severe hangover, (99:14-18); which she again attributes to being drugged, (101:12-\r\n\r\n17i 101:24- 102:15).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              26\r\n\f      It deeply upsets her that about the first night she no recollections and has no idea\r\n\r\nwhat happened to her; and, on the second night, Morris offensively touched and\r\n\r\npropositioned her, and on both following mornings, she awoke with severe hangovers,\r\n\r\n(102:8-12), Also, she feels that because Morris' arrest \"with drugs that co~o that\" on\r\n\r\nhis person proves her darkest fears, (103:8-11). It worries her that she ~@t know if she\r\n\r\nwas raped, (104:10-11). Once again, opposing counsel asked          M~wart if she was\r\n                                                                    0~\r\nsexually harassed and she agreed, (55:20-25; 93:5-12; 116:13-2~:5-15); however, she\r\n                                                                o<i@\r\nis not qualified to make that purely legal determination.    I~d, she conceded that she\r\n                                                     ~\r\ndoesn't even understand what the specific legal goals>~er suit are, (149:18- 150:7);\r\n\r\n                                                    J\r\ntherefore, she is not qualified to discuss its legal ~ s. She can only speak to the facts\r\n\r\nshe knows. Moreover, it is unfortunate in the~eme that while she is plagued by the\r\n\r\nhaunting fear that she was raped while in~e and totally vulnerable through no fault\r\n\r\nof her own, Defendants' only focus i~ dismiss the matter as a routine matter of\r\nworkplace misconduct which sho~~ disposed of on irrelevant technicalities,\r\n\r\n      Mter she returned to~ston, from the Boston trip, Morris criticized her\r\n\r\n                         a~t.e didn't tell him she was offended by his conduct because\r\nperformance, (125:7-22); ~Ml\r\n\r\n\"she felt the time to ~o was with a lawyer in a courtroom\", (129:3-22). While the\r\n                       ~·\r\ncompany had a h~ resources department, she felt it would have been futile to talk to\r\n\r\nit because it   w~aded by Allen, Morris' son, (129:23- 130:17); and, she never received\r\nthe comp~~exual harassment policy, (130:18- 131:9). However, when Morris fired her\r\n\r\nin April, only six weeks after she began, she bluntly asked him if it was because she\r\n\r\ndeclined the massage proposition and he cut her off, saying, \"We're not going there.\"\r\n\r\n(131:25- 132:19). In regard to her overall testimony, it should be noted that there are\r\n\r\ndisturbing consistencies in the facts alleged by all three of the Plaintiffs; each was isolated\r\n\r\n                                              27\r\n\fon a trip with Morris shortly after beginning work at Edible; drinking was a prominent\r\n\r\nfeature of every trip; Morris encouraged the drinking and brought drinks he made to each\r\n\r\nwoman; each suffered blackouts and memmy loss; each alleges physical offensive contact;\r\n\r\neach was primed with virtually identical soothing assurances; each was made to feel ve1y\r\n\r\nuncomfortable; and, each fears she was raped while unconscious.            An~~ this was at\r\nthe hands of the company president and CEO, many years theikYor and married.\r\n\r\nIndividually and in toto, they clearly state viable prima fa~saultjbattery claims\r\n\r\nagainst the Defendants, which have nothing                 what~o           do with workplace\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.                                                o,jjff\r\n         In addition to the facts presented in the     d~ depositions of the three Assault\r\nVictims, additional depositions have been,             ~rein    obtained as well. Interestingly,\r\n                                                   ~\r\nDefendants made no mention whateve1· ~m in their previously denied Motion for\r\n\r\nSumma1y Judgment and they            persis~ that glaring        omission in their instant Plea.\r\n\r\nHowever, their testimony is velyore.ant to the Court's instant analysis, so they too are\r\n\r\nsuccinctly summarized.            Q~\r\n         Andrea Farmer te~8 that Morris was frequently inappropriate in the office,\r\n\r\nsuch as hugging      wo...k'-~nployees\r\n                       ~~/\r\n                                       and drank excessively, (22:6-15); and, she saw him\r\n\r\npour something ~eth Jackson's drink in Chicago, (22:16-19). Indeed, she felt he was\r\n\r\n\"constantly    it&~ropriate\", (24:3-5). She worked at Edible for three months, (24:14-15);\r\n(May,    ~~ugust, 2011, (68:23- 69:2)), and, in fact she complained to Morris' sons,\r\nTrevor and Allen and she was told, \"That's just the way he is. Just ignore him.\" (24:16-\r\n\r\n26:6). On two trips, she observed him being sexually inappropriate with Beth Jacl<son,\r\n\r\n\r\n8   Deposition transcript of Fanner is attached hereto as Exhibit \"D\". Citations thereto are by page\r\nand line.\r\n                                                  28\r\n\fclients and herself, (27:13-16). She told the FBI she saw Morris pour something in Beth\r\n\r\nJackson's drink in Chicago and she decided that, \"Oh my gosh, something's gone terribly\r\n\r\nwrong.\" She felt that pouring something into a woman's drink without her knowledge was\r\n\r\ndeeply immoral, (29:8-20). They were in Chicago for a convention, including Morris, his\r\n                                                                          ~\r\nson Trevor, Beth Jackson and herself, (32:3-14). At the end of one day~§ gathered for\r\n\r\ndrinks, (32:22-25). Morris had been drinking liquor out of a   Peps~Ye during the day\r\n                                                                  o0\r\nand was quite drunk, (35:16- 36:2). They ordered drinks and wl~hey came to the table,\r\n\r\nMorris made a big deal of yelling for them to all look out   ~~ndow; while they did so,\r\nhe poured something in Beth's drink, (37:5- 38:10). Sll~rted to question him about it\r\n\r\nbecause she was alarmed, and he said, \"Shh, it's   fi~kay, don't say anything.\" (38: 11-\r\n\r\n                                          u\r\n17). Then, Beth mentioned that the dink tastOOcstronger and she stopped drinking it,\r\n                                              ~d\r\n(38:18-21).\r\n       At the time, she thought he mig~ve just added alcohol to Beth's drink, (43:23-\r\n\r\n44:1); but, later she decided it w~8ug. This was based upon seeing Beth with Morris\r\n\r\n                        ~or she could barely hold herself up and another time\r\nin Washington, D.C. in such\r\n\r\nin Houston when Beth w~~th him and appeared ve1y ill, grayish-green and looking\r\n                         (1_)~\r\nterrible, (44:2- 45:2o)~'§he said Morris' encouragement of excessive drinldng by others\r\n                     ~\r\nseemed very su;f$Ws, (47:11-19). On another occasion, she observed Morris and the\r\n\r\nfemale   comp1;l~r\r\n             !Q.\r\n                   at Aunt Sally's pralines in New Orleans. They met for drinks in the\r\n\r\nconcier~ge of their hotel. Shortly after that, they went out to walk on Bourbon Street\r\nand the woman appeared so drunk she could barely walk, which made her very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable. They went to Pat O'Brien's and Morris left her there, saying he was going\r\n\r\nto find the woman a cab, (53:13- 55:15); but, he was gone for over an hour and he had\r\n\r\nbeen inappropriately touching her, so she believed he took her back to his hotel room for\r\n\r\n                                            29\r\n\fillicit purposes, (59:3-18). This suspicion was enhanced when later he told her he had\r\n\r\ntaken the woman back to the hotel, which made no sense because she wasn't staying there,\r\n\r\n(61:16-22). Also, when they got back together, Morris' clothes were disheveled, he was\r\n\r\nvery sweaty and his hair was amuck, and he was over-excited and almost disoriented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlater, the woman apologized profusely for being so drunk, adding\r\n                                                                          *\r\nabout where they had been, (63:1-10). Then, when she talked to the co~~ller two days\r\n\r\n                                                                   ~n1le had no memo1y\r\n                                                                 o(ij\r\nof that night or how she wound up getting home and into bed, \\~1-20).

Morris   h~~ntal car he used to pick her up, (77:18-21).\r\nThis was on a Sunday evening, C7T25~8:3); and, they drove to the hotel, (78:2-4), (a\r\n                                    .

Then, she heard the click of a phone camera and she looked and\r\n\r\nrealized she was naked and Morris was standing over her, (81:23- 82:4). She was so tired\r\n\r\nshe had trouble adjusting to what was going on and she muttered, \"Wait, I'm not ... like\r\n\r\nwhat is going on?\" Then, she sat up and asked Morris if he had just taken a nude picture\r\n                                              30\r\n\fof her, (82:5-11); which he hastily denied, (82:12). She became upset and asked him what\r\n\r\nhe was doing there, and she told him to leave and to give her the picture she knew he had\r\n\r\ntaken, (82:12-15). She was disoriented and confused, but she told him he could not have\r\n\r\nthe picture, but he just said it was fine, (82:19-23). Then, Morris left the r * and came\r\n\r\nright back in to show her his Blackbeny, v.ith no picture in it. She tr~~ index it, but\r\n\r\ncan't, (83:8-17). Then, he left again and she went back to sleep for   f~Qours,\r\n                                                                         (84:6-9).\r\n                                                                   0~\r\n        Morris denied it, but, she was certain he took nude pi~s of her in her hotel\r\n                                                                olf@\r\nroom, (97:15-20). And, of course this was confirmed after~is was arrested and they\r\n\r\nfound several nude photos of her in a locked flash   drive~ office, (101:1-13).

On that trip, once again, Morris had\r\nher meet him in the conciel!~Unge oftheir hotel, (116:9-10).

She tried a few sips and then said she couldn't\r\n\r\ndrink it,   ~~6-18). They went to dinner; and, afterwards, Morris pressured her to have\r\nanother drink, but this time she mfused, (121:1-6). After they returned to Houston, she\r\n\r\nshortly learned that Morris refused to talk to her anymore, for a pretextual reason,\r\n\r\n(124:14-25). And, he remained distant and standoffish to her, (125:6-10).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             31\r\n\f       Later, she could vaguely remember being at dinner and that a comedian was there\r\n\r\nwhose picture Morris kept taking, (84:13-22).

That evening, she and Morris had\r\n\r\nmet in the hotel concierge lounge and had drinks, (89:14-18). She    dri~e and asked\r\nfor a glass of it, but Morris insisted she have a mixed drink,   (89:1~Q. She insisted on\r\n                                                                   o(\\j\r\nwine and he poured her a glass, but, then he told her they sho~t another drink to-go\r\n\r\nand go to runner in Manhattan and he insisted she have a   ~~drink, and he fixed her a\r\ndrink in a to-go cup, (90:17-25). However, the drink w~ strong she couldn't drink it,\r\n\r\nand she told him that. He then added some   soda~£ insisted that she drink it, (91:1-\r\n22). Shortly, she began to feel very dizzy, (92ffi10). In the elevator, Morris began to\r\n                                              ~C'\r\nmassage her neck and back, which she t~t was weird, (93:4-16); she told him that\r\n\r\nwas not necessary as it was making he~comfortable, and he stopped. But, later he put\r\n\r\nhis hands on her shoulders   an~~~Jih:16-25). By the time they arrived in Manhattan,\r\nshe was Clisoriented, (92:11-16d, Morris began holding her hand which made her feel\r\n\r\nvery uncomfortable, (93 :1~\r\n                      efJJ\r\n      This next morn~; incredibly, Morris was at the door of her hotel room asking why\r\n                  ~\r\nshe wasn't ready ~~e the client! (102:7- 103:8). She met him downstairs and it was she\r\n\r\nwho was   apo~ng for being unprofessional, (103:11-15); she blamed herselffor losing\r\ncontrol! ~22- 104:3). This is a creepy aspect of evmy one of Morris' victims: what\r\n\r\nhappened to them is so outlandish and bizarre; it is always they who take responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd, that is one of the most heartrending aspects of this case. Morris has already\r\n\r\nconfessed to federal felonies; but, even now he refuses to take any moral or civil legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility whatever for these heinous attacks. She emphatically denied giving Morris\r\n\r\n                                             32\r\n\fconsent to take nude pictures of her, (104:4-24). In response, Morris dismissed her\r\n\r\nconcern by saying it \"was no big deal\", (106:11-15). She felt terrible that day and continued\r\n\r\nto feel disoriented, (107:1-7), They went to dinner in Connecticut that night, but there\r\n\r\nwere no problems, (108:2- 110:8). On the final night of the trip, Morris *tioned the\r\n\r\nnight of her attack by saying he \"didn't want her to feel    uncomfortabl~use they had\r\ndone nothing wrong.\" (111:24- 112:3); he added that he felt a      consi~<;Jle \"attraction\" to\r\n                                                                       0~\r\nher, and that he wanted her to stay with the company for a~ time, (112:4-9). She\r\n                                                                  o0\r\nreplied that even if she had consented to what had happ~it was wrong because he\r\n\r\nwas married, (112:10-15); but, he said he had \"never     do~ything like this before and he\r\nreally liked her.\" (113:4-7). Then, he claimed he    h~ marriage, (113:10-12). She told\r\nhim their relationship had to be professional; ~~e told her he would hug her whenever\r\n\r\nhe felt like it, (113:13- 114:1). She   sta1ted~ng fOl' another job immediately, (114:18-\r\n20).                                       ~-\r\n       Erin Bjork testified9    that~orked for Edible from November, 2011, to mid-\r\nFebruary, 2012, (7:3-13). She r@ent!yinteracted with Defendant Morris, (14:14-16). He\r\n\r\nmade her feel very tmcom~le, (15:2-5); for instance, one day he came into her office,\r\n                        ,prpJ\r\nshut the door and beg~scussing her bathroom habits, (15:9-11; 15:16-21). On a day\r\n                    ~ wanted a sandwich in her room or whether she wanted to \"go out\r\ntrip, he asked her ~e\r\n\r\nbecause they #on the road\", whicll she thought was very weird, (17:1-6). Morris asked\r\n\r\nher to tr~~th him, but she firmly declined, (18:20-19:13). He did not come onto her,\r\n\r\nbut, she received a detailed complaint that he had from Michelle Barnett, which shocked\r\n\r\nher and made her sad, (20:12- 22:17). She was certain that the complaint was true, (23:10-\r\n\r\n\r\n9Deposition transcript of Bjork is attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\".

She told her husband the story and he advised her to leave the company and she told\r\n\r\nher mother, who was equally shocked, (24:20- 25:8). She felt Ms. Barnett should report\r\n\r\nthe matter, because she had been violated and she believed her, but it wasn't her call,\r\n\r\n(25:9- 26:1).\r\n\r\n         Then, later, Keri Hill came back from a trip with Morris,        loold~ted and all\r\nout of sorts\". At first, she denied any problems, but then said she ~roubled because\r\n\r\non the trip she blacked out and had no memory, (30:19- 31:14t~ had a rape kit d~ne\r\n                                                         0 '!@~\r\n\r\nand said her husband told her she had been drugged, (3~~ 32:5); and, she was very\r\n\r\ndistraught, (32:17-19). This second story about         Morri~~ply disturbed her, (32:9-10);\r\nbecause the two stories were so similar,        (34:4-8~ that, she refused to travel with\r\nMorris, and she was let go by him, (35:6-16;        3~~16).\r\n\r\n          Further, Samantha Gluck testified(f'her discovery deposition, in relevant part,\r\n\r\nthat Defendant Morris assaulted her b~~hing her and trying to get her to do things she\r\n\r\ndidn't want to do and she report~* to the FBI, (29:2-10). Very interestingly, opposing\r\n\r\ncounsel asked most of the 11'.it~s about sexual harassment, which is a manifestly legal\r\n\r\nterm; yet, when Ms. Glue!~~ she had been assaulted, he questioned her at length about\r\n\r\nthe fact that she had     ~al\r\n                         training to allow her to define that term, (29:11- 30:1). She\r\n                    ~\r\ncountered that s~~ant that Morris had tried to kiss hel' and had toucl!ed her breasts,\r\n\r\nrubbed his h #up and down her sides and grabbed her, \"on her breasts, evmywhere\",\r\n\r\n(30:2-8~lso tried to get her to both drink alcohol and to drink more of it than she\r\nwanted, (30:13-16).

She was very shocked and\r\n\r\npushed him away and said no; but, he was very persistent and kept grabbing her. She told\r\n\r\nhim to stop, but, he just kept at it. Finally, he stopped and she         ~lro her room\r\ndevastated, (66:11- 67:25). She called her husband, crying and up~~9:5-13); and, he\r\n\r\ntoo became upset, (69:13-14). He said he \"wanted to kill the b~\", (76:2-17). But, the\r\n\r\nnext day, she did not talk to Morris about the matter   becau~was afraid, (80:25- 81:6).\r\nHowever, she was adamant that he attacked her and sh~'t initiate the contact, (81:18-\r\n\r\n82:2). Morris was quiet all day, (82:8-17).         Q~\r\n        Then, there was a second trip to Phila:fl~hia, (89:12-14). And, the first incident\r\n\r\nwas essentially repeated: Monis       invitee(~to his room after dinner and when she\r\narrived, he had his shirt off and   starte~ on her again, (95:19-23). He had earlier made\r\n                                      .. @!\r\nher a drink, but it didn't taste~ (96:23- 97:6). (Later, she came to believe he had\r\n\r\ndrugged it, (109:4-12)). EvenQ he l<ept telling her, drink up, drink up, no matter how\r\n\r\nbadly it tasted,   (97:17-1~\"'1a, he continued to pressure her about it, which she found\r\nvery odd,   (99:9-10)~oon as she got to his room, he tried to get to sit on the bed and\r\nhe began aggr~~ kissing her and touching her all over. She repeatedly told him no;\r\n\r\nbut, he said   ~dy would know. Finally, she bolted out of the room, (107:4-18).            She\r\n\r\ndrank   ve1~;a1h1e that night, but the next morning, she felt terrible, so she believes Morris\r\nput something in her funny tasting drink, (109:25-110:14). But, she never reported these\r\n\r\nincidents because offear, (137:19-24).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               35\r\n\f      Still later, Morris resuscitated her after she fainted; and, when she awoke, her bra\r\n\r\nwas undone; he said that was to allow her to breathe easier, which she thought ridiculous,\r\n\r\n(142!16-24).\r\n\r\n       During the discovery deposition of Ms. Beth Jackson, the onl*e of those\r\n\r\ndiscussed herein in which the undersigned counsel for Plaintiffs          as~uestions, she\r\ntestifiedu in relevant part that she is a graduate of Boston      Colleg~\\Jh a bachelor's in\r\nfinance, (8:9-12).

Initially~e said she reviewed no documents before her\r\ndeposition, (26:13-15); but, then~nceded that before her own deposition, she in fact\r\n\r\nread the statements of Keri~, Michelle Barnett, Andrea Farmer, Stacy Stewart,\r\n\r\nBrannen DeVille, Diedra Ml.\\~eoud and Samantha Gluck, as well as the depositions of\r\n                           ~~\r\nKeri Hill and MichelleUnett, (26:13- 27:14).

She stated that initially,\r\n\r\nshe had a business relationship with Morris, (32:10-12); but, she later conceded that even\r\n\r\nthough she knows he is married to Ruth, whom she has met, (35:3-10), she has travelled\r\n\r\nwith him at least once a month since 2009, (37:4-11), and she        h~~ng-running\r\n\"personal relationship\" with him since about 2005, (49:4-22), lasili\"to 2011, (51:21-\r\n                                                                  0~\r\n52:4); which specifically included a sexuall·elationship with h~~9:20- 50:4). During\r\n\r\nthis time, both of them were married to other people,   event~ their respective spouses\r\ndid not lmow of their illicit relationship, (50:5-20).   ~relationship included sexual\r\nintercourse, (50:1-4), digital penetration,   (53:6-~allowing him to photograph her\r\nnude, (53:21-23), on numerous occasions anl~Jilumerous locations, (53:24- 54:5). He\r\n\r\ntook these nude photos with his cell pho~ich he would then save by downloading\r\n\r\nthem onto hard drives or flash drives, (~-8); her only restriction being that in the fully\r\n\r\nnude photos, her face not be shpfb4:16- 55:2).

The FBI now has the photos,\r\n(61:1-7). She also   con~q that Morris confided to her that he also took nude photos of\r\n                      ~\"\r\nAndrea Farmer, (~~19).              .\r\n       She   sa~orris often travels with small \"airplane\" bottles, (63:8-10); which she\r\nassume~~ed to \"re-cycle\" liquor, (63:24- 64:4); and, she has seen Morris often make\r\ndrinks for others, (68:12-14), including the use of \"to-go\" cups, (69:1-3). Therefore,\r\n\r\nthough she disagrees with Andrea Farmer's testimony \"too%\", (67:14-16); and also 100%,\r\n\r\n(83:12-13), ·with that of Keri Hill, (76:22- 80:15), and even v.>ith that of Stacy Stewart,\r\n\r\n (85:17- 88:3), Samantha Gluclc, (88:8-25) and, even Ms. Farmer's allegations about the\r\n\r\n                                               37\r\n\fAunt Sally's comptroller, (91:20- 93:2); such multiple disagreement must be filtered\r\n\r\nthrough her obvious bias in favor of her longtime lover, (107:20- 108:8), Defendant\r\n\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n       On the basis of this mass of testimony, it was clear to the Court in its denial of\r\n\r\nDefendants previously filed MSJ and its should continue to be clear in   t~nt analysis\r\n                                                              Am~~ Petition claims,\r\nof Defendants' equally flawed Plea that, as set out in their Third\r\n\r\nwhat Morris did to the Assault Victims is morally and legally ~~trous. Morris didn't\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against the Assault Victims, whether in or    o~e workplace; rather, he\r\nphysically attacked and sexually violated them!     Mor~~ expressly confessed that he\r\ninvited or induced the deferential and trusting    ~$victims across state lines; where\r\nin remote cities he mendaciously       drugged~         and all of them into intentional\r\n\r\ninsensibility, with the explicit intent offor~y removing their clothing, photographing\r\n\r\nthem naked and sexually     assaultin~em while they were completely inert and\r\nvulnerable. He treated each of ~.J;?fJas slabs of meat, to be abused while completely\r\n\r\ninsensate and defenseless, fm~sole purpose of gratifying his perverse, deviant sexual\r\n\r\nappetites. And, because hi\"~n-practiced drugging technique was ve1y effective, he now\r\n                         ~~\r\ncomes to this Court ~ng that the claims of the Assault Victims be trivialized and\r\n                     ~~\r\ndisposed of nude~ rubric of the TCHRA, which was intended by the Legislature to\r\n\r\nprovide an or# mechanism to deal with workplace discrimination and most certainly\r\n\r\nnever in~d as a procedural means to protect deviant sexual predators. In seeking such\r\n\r\na result, the Defendants brazenly ask for perfect immunity from personal, moral and legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility for Morris' overtly criminal and intentionally tortious acts. What an\r\n\r\nastonishing extremis to twist a \"Human Rights Act\" into!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              38\r\n\f         Both the previously denied MSJ and the instant Plea are factually predicated upon\r\n\r\nthe Assault Victims' physical inability to remember all of the details of their victimization.\r\n\r\nBut, such chemically induced diminished memory does not erase either the occurrence or\r\n\r\nmagnitude of their violation; it only emphasizes just how appallingly awfully they were\r\n\r\ntreated. Defendants' persistent pursuit of summary and/ or           proced~\"~ief on this\r\ndismissive basis defies logic and common sense and is fatally defec~~r four important\r\n\r\n                                                          nea~~entical, even though\r\nreasons. First, the stories of all of the Assault Victims are\r\n\r\nthey were separate in time, place and victim; which very ~~cingly establish Morris'\r\n\r\nmodus opemndi, as well as his malevolent, confessed ~~anal conduct. Second, these\r\nallegations are further confirmed by the     depositi~rin McMullan, Andrea Farmer,\r\nand Samantha Gluck, the latter two being ad~~al assault victims who do not happen\r\n\r\nto be plaintiffs in this case. So, thus f~y five victims corroborate Morris' vile\r\n\r\nconduct.' 2 Third, no less than a grand j~f the United States of America considered the\r\n\r\nfractured memories of the thoro~~raumatized Assault Victims and came to the polar\r\n\r\nopposite perception of  such~ch Defendants now urge upon this Court; finding\r\nsufficient cause to indict~ on multiple federal felony charges which precisely mirror\r\n\r\nthe actual claims   eac~~ntiff makes. And, fifth, Morris has already pled guilty to this\r\n                    ~\r\nentire disgusting ~~rio!\r\n\r\n    b.   PlaintL~ssert\r\n             g\"'l'     valid assault claims against Morris under Texas law.\r\n\r\n         T~~ should be clear that not one single Plaintiff asserted any claim whatsoever\r\nwhich is based upon or arises out of sexual harassment in tllEi worl<place; and, Defendants'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12 Still other victims have rendered statements to the FBI; but, as they have not been deposed in\r\n\r\ndiscovery herein, there stories are not herein discussed. However, they are out there as further\r\ncorroboration of Morris' heinous conduct.\r\n                                                39\r\n\fpersistent contentions that their claims are all so intertwined with sexual harassment in\r\n\r\nthe workplace as to be controlled by the TCHRA and Waffle House is a distortion of the\r\n\r\nfacts and claims herein and a misstatement of that law. It is true that each Plaintiff was\r\n\r\nenticed, directed or induced to travel with Morris on a \"business trip\". But, his intentional\r\n\r\ndrugging of each Assault Victim had nothing to do with work or job     du~~atsoever. If\r\nMorris had travelled to each of the stated cities on business; and, w~~ere he had gone\r\n\r\nout into the night and knoeked some stranger on the head        a~ile that person was\r\nunconscious he sexually assaulted him or her, it would be   ~ous to allege that he did\r\nso as a part of his business. The exact same logic    app~o the instant claims.

Moreover, in separating out the battery claim which was not b~~ it, the Court\r\n\r\nnoted that: \"We have recognized that the legislative creation of a\r\n                                                                   0~\r\n                                                                      s~Yory remedy is not\r\npresumed to displace common-law remedies.

There, the plaintiff was an African-American\r\n\r\n municipal fire chief who alleged a conspiracy to deprive him of his job.

Morris wasn't \"acting in his capacity as an employee,\" (Plea, pgs. 24-\r\n\r\n25), he was acting as a deviant, sexual predator which had nothing to      ~th      his job\r\n\r\n                                                               withA~le, objective\r\nwhatsoever!

(f\r\n       In that regard, the authority cite&;efendants in suppmt of denying the Assault\r\n\r\nVictims their right to assert   thei~s is singularly unavailing. In Hoffman-La Roche\r\n                            ~ 438, 448 (Tex. 2008), the Texas Supreme Court\r\n                           ..\r\nInc. v. Zeltwange1•, 144 S. v~\r\n\r\nconsidered a clearly work~~situation where a worker's supervisor repeated made off-\r\n\r\ncolor jokes and rem~U her and after she complained, he retaliated in the workplace\r\n\r\nby screaming at h~d otherwise belittling her. The Court determined that the plaintiff\r\n\r\nthere could nf,sert both a sexual harassment claim and an intentional infliction of\r\n\r\nemotion~~ress tort. As Defendants note, (Plea, pg. 31), the Court did say, \"If the\r\ngravamen of a plaintiffs complaint is the type of wrong that the statutory remedy was\r\n\r\nmeant to cover, a plaintiff ca1mot maintain an intentional infliction claim regardless of\r\n\r\nwhether he or she succeeds on, or even makes, a statutory claim.\" Id, at 448. But, they\r\n\r\nmiss the point of that quote entirely. The operative factor was the type of wrong a\r\n\r\n                                             68\r\n\f\"statutory remedy was meant to cover.\" Here, there is no such statutmy remedy\r\n\r\nmandatorily applicable!\r\n\r\n      Similarly, every single decision Defendants' cite in purported support of the\r\n\r\napplicability of Wqffle House is distinguishable from or inapposite to the ~~nt analysis.\r\n\r\nIn Taylor v. Seton Healthcare, 2012 WL 13680 (W.D. Tex. 2012),        1;\\,~aintiffs were\r\nhospital employees who alleged hair pulls, smelling of hair,    sh~Q. touches, hugs,\r\n                                                                0~\r\nbrushing contact, a possible buttocks touching, touching of ~;ts, sexual innuendo\r\n                                                         o<f@\r\ncomments, inappropriate private questions and        sugg~ movements,          which all\r\n                                                     ~\r\noccurred on the job, in the context of daily duties ~e physical workplace.

While certainly serious allega~, these are classic workplace sexual\r\n\r\nharassment contentions. Therefore, the C~ decision that such complaints supported\r\n\r\nTCHRA claims, but not assaultclai~ply has no relevance to the instant claims.\r\nForbes v. A.G. Edwards & Sons,~~ o. o8-CV-552, 2009 WL 424146, at *8 (S.D .N.Y.\r\n\r\nFeb. 18, 2009), is distinguis~e because there the court's prima1y focus was the\r\n\r\nenforcement of a broad aE~tion clause, which is of course not present in this case.\r\n                           ©!~\r\nLikevl'ise, in Jones v. ~burton Co., 791 F. Supp. 2d 567,581 (S.D. Tex. 2011), the court\r\n                       ~\r\napplied the Defen~ses Act, (DBA), which extends the LHWCA, 33 U.S. C. § 901, et seq\r\n\r\nto injuries or   ~s occurring on overseas milita1y bases. The plaintiff alleged she was\r\nraped on~~y a fellow contractor employee and the court determined that her remedy\r\n\r\nwas under the exclusive provisions of the Act. Once again, that simply has nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith the instant analysis, where the TCHRA does not apply. Finally, in City of Waco v.\r\n\r\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 149 (Tex. 2008), the Supreme Comt considered a claim by the\r\n\r\nCity's Chief Plumbing Inspector, who was transferred and demoted. The Court noted that\r\n\r\n                                            69\r\n\fany claim he had was under the TCHRA and not the Texas Whistleblower Act.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, so what? That factual scenario has absolutely no relevance whatever to the\r\n\r\ninstant analysis. Indeed, Defendants fail to cite one single case in which the TCHRA was\r\n\r\napplied in facts such as those involved here. The reason for that is obvious: ~e are none!\r\n\r\n      Why do Defendants work so hard to bring Plaintiffs' claims          u~the TCHRA?\r\nDefendants make clear that these claims must fall within the      TC~n order to argue\r\n                                                                   o(Q5\r\nthat they are time-barred.

This mirrored the Court's prior ruling in Mimnda, \"If the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             78\r\n\fpleadings affu·matively negate the existence of jurisdiction, then a plea to the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nmay be granted without allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.\" I d., at 227. But,\r\n\r\nno such negation has here occurred and the Assault Victims' Third Amended Petition\r\n\r\nclearly states the viable claims of each of them. See Kess ling v. Friendswood Indep.

F).\r\n\r\nDuring roughly the period of      Feb~~f;» 8,    2010,   through about February   27, 2012,\r\n\r\nMorris took various female e * e s with him on business-related trips to cities\r\n\r\noutside Texas. On each trip,   ~Qhis victims were thus isolated, far from home and all\r\nthe more vulnerable,   Q~ date-rape        drugged and, without their consent, sexually\r\n\r\nabused, molested anlhtook nude photographs of his unconscious and completely\r\n                    o~@>v\r\n\r\ninsensate and   d~eless victims. Although each trip arose out of Morris' capacity as\r\nPresident a~ of Edible and the supervisor of each of his victims, and the company\r\n\r\nshould be hcla liable for the intentionally tortious acts of its principal, Morris' predatory\r\n\r\nacts had nothing whatever to do with his victims' work conditions. Among his victims\r\n\r\nwas Ms. Farmer and Defendants' instant effort to characterize her claims as workplace\r\n\r\ncomplaints is franldy both cynical and delusional.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             3\r\n\f       In confirmation of that, it's important for the Court to note that in their instant\r\n\r\nM/MSJ, Defendants' entire Section II, \"Statement ·of Facts,\" (M/MSJ, pgs. 2-8),\r\n\r\naddresses the alleged nature and scope of Ms. Farmer's recollections of her violation by\r\n\r\nMorris, with numerous citations to her Original Petition, (Response Ex. A), her.\r\n\r\nstatement to the FBI, (Motion Ex. D), and her deposition, (Motion Ex. ~espouse Ex.\r\n                                                                       £~@;\r\nI), as though those documents constitute the exclusive factual    univ~ upon       which this\r\n\r\ncase and Ms. Farmer's claims are based. Moreover, such factu#entation adds much\r\n\r\nthat has no actual role in this case, namely Ms. FarmQ~iscussions of workplace\r\n\r\nconditions. First, she discusses such only in response .fu.

Second, ~ facts might be very important\r\n\r\nwere Ms. Farmer asserting an employment        sexu~arassment\r\n                                                ~~\r\n                                                              or discrimination claim.\r\n\r\nHowever, regarding her actual claims, all ~ facts are completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n    Conversely, not a single word or re&nce is therein contained regarding the bigger\r\n\r\npicture of this case, which is, again,~ically important to each of the bases Defendants\r\n\r\nassert in support of their disne'fand/or summary judgment motion. Absent is any\r\n\r\nreference to the   Supersedi~dictment,        (Response Ex. F), Morris' Plea Agreement,\r\n                           IQJ~                                                .\r\n(Response Ex.

He also said they [the women accusers, including\r\nMs. Farmer] were only making accusations against him to bolster civil suits pending in Harris\r\nCounty.\" (Such article is admissible pursuant to Tex.

In doing so, she will        demon~~~to the Court's satisfaction that the\r\ninstant M/MSJ should be denied in each a~ry particular.\r\n\r\n        B. The complete facts.                 ~\r\n          In her deposition, (Respo~~· I),a Ms. Farmer testified in relevant part that\r\n\r\nshe went with Morris to Phil~j)hia and Newark about two weeks after she started\r\n\r\nworking at Edible, (75:18- ~), [in May, 2011]. She flew by herself and met Morris at\r\n\r\nthe Philadelphia       airpo~7:7-17). Morris had a rental car he used to pick her up,\r\n                           ~\r\n(77:18-21). This     w~ a Sunday evening, (77:25- 78:3);        and, they drove to the hotel,\r\n\r\n(78:2-4), (a    Ma~, (79:23)). Morris wanted to meet in the concierge lounge, but it was\r\n           ~ in the hotel bar, (79:2-8). They stayed there about an hour and a half,\r\nclosed so ~et\r\n\r\n(79:18-19); then she went to sleep, (79:20-21). However, the next night, they went to the\r\n\r\nNewark Marriott, (81:14-17); in order to see a New Jersey client the following day,\r\n\r\n(81:23-24). Later, she could vaguely remember being at dinner and that a comedian was\r\n\r\n3   Transcript citations are by page and line(s).\r\n                                                    5\r\n\fthere whose picture Morris kept taking, (84:13-22). She has no idea where they were or\r\n\r\nwhat she had for dinner, or any other details, (86: 9-13). She remembered going through\r\n\r\na tunnel on the way to dinner, but little else, (89:6-13). That evening, she and Morris\r\n\r\nhad met in the hotel concierge lounge and had drinks, (89:14-18). She drinks wine and\r\n\r\nasked for a glass of it, but Morris insisted she have a mixed drink, ~:18-25). She\r\n                                                                      _e~(fjj\r\ninsisted on wine and he poured her a glass, but, then he told her th~1ould get another\r\n\r\ndrink to-go and go to dinner in Manhattan and he insisted sh~~ a mixed drink, and\r\n\r\nhe fixed her a drink in a to-go cup, (90:17-25). Howeve~drink was so strong she\r\n\r\ncouldn't drink it, and she told him iliat. He then added ~·e soda to it and insisted iliat\r\n                                                         o;JEF\r\nshe drink it, (91:1-22). Shortly, she began to feel    v~dizzy,   (92:1-10). In the elevator,\r\n\r\nMorris began to massage her neck and back,      wh~ she thought was weird, (93:4-16);\r\n                                                o~JI\r\n\r\nshe told him that was not necessary      as~as         making her uncomfortable, and he\r\n\r\nstopped. But, later he put his hands o~r shoulders anyway, (93:16-25). By the time\r\n\r\niliey arrived in Manhattan, she wa~~oriented, (92:11-13); and, Morris began holding\r\n\r\nher hand which made her feel   ~~comfortable, (93:1-3).\r\n       Ms. Farmer has absoh~y no memory of anything about ilie dinner or going to it\r\n                           ~g~\"\"\r\nor getting home, (95:2{il6:15). At some point that night, she awoke in her hotel bed\r\n\r\nwith a pillow and\r\n                    .JJ!covers over her head and her blanket\r\n                    s~~~\r\n                                                      . down around her anldes.\r\nThen, she hear# click of a phone camera and she looked and realized she was naked\r\n\r\nand MorriSs standing over her, (81:23- 82:4). She was so tired she had trouble\r\n\r\nadjusting to what was going on and she muttered, \"Wait, I'm not ... like what is going\r\n\r\non?\" Then, she sat up and asked Morris if he had just taken a nude picture of her, (82:5-\r\n\r\n11); which he hastily denied, (82:12). She became upset and asked him what he was\r\n\r\ndoing there, and she told him to leave and to give her the picture she knew he had taken,\r\n\r\n                                            6\r\n\f(82:12-15). She was disoriented and confused, but she told him he could not have the\r\n\r\npicture, but he just said \"it was fine,\" (82:19-23). Then, Morris left the room and came\r\n\r\nright back in to show her his Blackberry, with no picture in it. She tried to index it, but\r\n\r\ncouldn't, (83:8-17). Then, he left again and she went back to sleep for four hours, (84:6-\r\n\r\n9).\r\n       She very vaguely recalls that when she awoke in her hotel\r\n                                                                        ~\r\n                                                                         *\r\n                                                                    ~ bed nude, with\r\nMorris standing over her, it was about 4:00am, (99:4-8). She# a d an apprehension\r\n\r\nthat he was taking nude pictures of her because she heaQ~ click of the Blackberry,\r\n\r\n(97:15-20). That he actually did so was not confirmed n~J much later after Morris was\r\n                                                            0~-\r\n\r\narrested and they found several nude photos of her~ locked flash drive in his office,\r\n\r\n(101:1-13). She clearly remembers him in her rlil;;J and herself naked in bed, (98:1-5).\r\n                                                       ~~\r\nHe left her room about 4:00 am and she t r e p t until about 8:oo am, (99:4-11). She\r\n\r\nemphatically denied giving Morris co~t to take nude pictures of her, (104:4-24).\r\n\r\nMore importantly, in addition to b~i?'Zil~ng she had been photographed nude, she also\r\n                                     ~~r'\r\nfeels certain that she was physi~'§ violated because she had redness in her vaginal area\r\n\r\nand bruises on her arm anch\"\\ip area\". (99:12-22). Although she did not feel she had\r\n                             ©~\r\nbeen raped, she felt li~she had \"been touched\" and she was sore in her \"female\r\n                      ~~\r\nregions\", especially(J),_,-...e outside, (100:1-10).\r\n\r\n       The nex#ning, incredibly, Morris was at the door of her hotel room asking\r\n\r\nwhy she   w~~ready to see the client! (102:7- 103:8). She met him downstairs and it\r\nwas she who was apologizing for being unprofessional, (103:11-15); she blamed herself\r\n\r\nfor losing control, (103:22- 104:3). In response, Morris dismissed her concern by saying\r\n\r\nit \"was no big deal\", (106:11-15). She felt terrible that day and continued to feel\r\n\r\ndisoriented, (107:1-7). Later, he told her he had \"never done anything like this before\r\n\r\n                                                 7\r\n\fand he really liked her.\" (113:4-7). Then, he claimed he had a bad marriage, (113:10-12).\r\n\r\nShe told him their relationship had to be professional; but, he told her he would hug her\r\n\r\nwhenever he felt like it, (113:13- 114:1). She started looking for another job immediately,\r\n\r\n(114:18-20) .. Ms. Farmer took one more business trip with Morris. On that trip, once\r\n\r\nagain, Morris had her meet him in the concierge lounge of their hote~6:9~10). He\r\n                                                                        ~®i\r\nasked her if she wanted a drink and she asked for a chardonnay. B1~tter he brought it\r\n\r\nto her, it tasted disgusting, like strong medicine, with a #itter alkaline taste,\r\n\r\n(116:18-25). She said the taste was definitely not a norm~, (118:3-25). She tried a\r\n\r\nfew sips and then said she couldn't drink it, (119:16-iRl. They went to dinner; and,\r\n\r\nafterwards, Morris pressured her to have       anothe~nk,\r\n                                                         ·~'   but this time she refused,\r\n\r\n(121:1-6). After they returned to Houston, she    ~~~y learned that Morris refused to talk\r\n                                                  ~\r\nto her anymore, for a pretextual reason~:14-25). And, he remained distant and\r\n\r\nstandoffish to her, (125:6-10).          ~\r\n       Contrary to Morris' deceitf~lil>resentation to Ms. Farmer that \"he had never\r\n\r\ndone anything list this before,   ~is criminal lawyer's comment that Ms. Farmer and\r\nthe other victims were    mo.v~\r\n                           ~JU\r\n                                making     allegations up to aggrandize their civil suits,\r\n\r\n(obviously including tl~one), ((Response Ex.

F). And, while charge does not equal\r\nconviction,~gard to Ms. Farmer, in the Plea Agreement, (Response Ex. G), Morris\r\nexplicitly agreed to the truth and validity of the facts alleged in Count Five thereof, that:\r\n\r\n\"On or about May 8, 2011, Morris traveled in interstate commerce and committed, and\r\n\r\nattempted to commit, the drug-facilitated sexual assault of [Ms. Farmer].\" (Id., pg. 6-7).\r\n\r\nAnd, Morris further plead guilty to the offenses of \"violating 18 U.S.C. § 2421, as well as\r\n\r\n                                              8\r\n\fNew Jersey Statutes Annotated 2C:14-9(b), Invasion of Privacy.\" (Id.). Morris further\r\n\r\nagreed that he was arrested by the FBI on February 27, 2012, at IAH, when he was\r\n\r\nattempting to leave on another business trip. He had with him three bottles of the\r\n\r\n\"unknown liquid\" he used to dilute the drugs he administered to Ms. Farmer by means\r\n\r\nof alcoholic beverages he supplied to her. He also had four Viagra table~d four Cialis\r\n\r\ntablets for himself and five pills of the type he administered\r\n                                                                 _c;'il.~!f!j; Farmer, which\r\n                                                                 t~.\r\n\r\nincluded sleeping pills and sedatives, which according      t~~         analysis and a\r\n                                                            ~\r\nsupervisory FBI Forensic Chemist and Toxicologist were ~tent with the symptoms\r\n\r\nshe described when she was attacked by Morris, which~luded drowsiness, dizziness,\r\n                                                    0~~\r\n\r\nloss of muscle control, slurred speech,       deere~   inhibitions, memory loss or\r\n\r\n                                              ~~orris agreed that he drugged Ms.\r\nimpairment, loss of consciousness.

So, it's\r\n\r\nimperative for   ~ourt to observe that while she was very confused that night and\r\nafterwards,~ore story has been confirmed by forensic evidence and the confession of\r\nMorris!\r\n\r\n      In Ms. Farmer's statement to the FBI, dated February 22, 2013, (Motion Ex.

Jackson testified in her deposition,4 in re~t part, that\r\n                   .                                                          /?._'@\r\nShe drinks 2-3 mixed drinks daily, (28:3-9); and, she has often            be~put      drinking with\r\n\r\nDefendant Morris, (22:1-5; 27:19-21; 30:3-8; 33:25- 34:3).

This relationship included\r\n\r\nsexual intercourse, (50:1-4), ~tal penetration, (53:6-8), and allowing him to\r\n\r\nphotograph her nude,         (53:~~), on numerous occasions and in numerous locations,\r\n                        0~\r\n(53:24- 54:5). He took ~e nude photos with his cell phone, which he would then save\r\n                           ~\r\nby downloading         t~i?onto    hard drives or flash drives, (55:3-8); her only restriction\r\n\r\nbein)l; that in   t~ly nude photos, her face not be shown, (54:16- 55:2). She said she\r\nintended     M@-~ to use the photos to arouse himself with his wife because while she\r\neasily aroused him, his wife did not, (54:9- 56:2; 57:8- s8:s; 58:25- 59:19; 60:5-19). The\r\n\r\nFBI now has the photos, (61:1-7). She also conceded that Morris confided to her\r\n\r\nthat he also took nude photos ofAndrea Farmer, (61:8-19).\r\n\r\n4   Citations to the transcript thereof are by page and line(s).\r\n                                                    10\r\n\f       Jackson said Morris often travels with small \"airplane\" bottles, (63:8-10); which\r\n\r\nshe assumed he used to \"re-cycle\" liquor, (63:24- 64:4); and, she has seen Morris often\r\n\r\nmake drinks for others, (68:12-14), including the use of \"to-go\" cups, (69:1-3).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she obdurately disagrees with Andrea Farmer's testimony \"too%\", (67:14-\r\n\r\n16). The Court can evaluate the credibility of such testimony.             '*\r\n                                                                         !f!1\r\n       Finally, in her Original Petition on file herein, (Response    rfi1' A), Ms. Farmer\r\nmade very clear that the factual basis of her claims was that:   \"~ant Morris drugged\r\nFarmer by putting an unknown substance into a drink, u~~ownst to Farmer. During\r\n\r\nthis time, Morris attempted to sexually assault     Farmer~~\r\n                                                       o;!f[F took pictures of her while\r\nshe was unconscious.\" (Id., pg. 2). Thus, while          t~aims   asserted are assault and\r\n\r\ninvasion of privacy, the gravamen thereof are dm2nduced unconsciousness and sexual\r\n                                                   O~J\r\n\r\nassault, the very crimes Morris has pled g~ in federal court.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, on the basis of this ~ of supporting evidence and information, it\r\n\r\nseems remarkably disingenuous tl),vfendants, in their instant M/MSJ, (filed January\r\n\r\n16, 2015, over five (5) weeks    ae~orris' entry of his sworn guilty plea), are even now\r\ncontending: (1) \"plaintiff WJili~Ware of the alleged assault and impermissible pictures\r\n                              g~\r\ntaken of her at the time~ events occurred,\" (M/MSJ, Pg. 3); (2) \"she could remember\r\n                      ~\r\n... Morris allegedly~aging in sexually inappropriate and/or offensive behavior with\r\n\r\nher,\" (Id.); (3)   \"~ad reason to believe that she had been physically violated,\" (Id., pg.\r\n4); and,   (4~'Ye allegedly saw, was aware of and observed these things at that time.\"\r\n(Id.). First, there is nothing whatever \"alleged\" about what Morris did to Ms. Farmer. He\r\n\r\nhas pled guilty to every lurid detail of it under oath! Second, Defendants want to lock\r\n\r\nMs. Farmer into specific recollections, when the thrust of her entire testimony was that\r\n\r\nshe was drugged and completely out of it during her violation and has only the vaguest\r\n\r\n                                              11\r\n\frecollections of it. Such a distortion is especially reprehensible where Morris admitted\r\n\r\nthe sophisticated nature of his carefully plotted and executed drugging of Ms. Framer to\r\n\r\nachieve exactly the intoxication and disorientation Defendants now contend she doesn't\r\n\r\nhave! Third, not only does her testimony support her claims, even Defendants admit\r\n\r\nthat when she was questioned by the FBI, she expressly denied memo~ recollection\r\n\r\nof the pictures taken or what they depicted until the FBI showed\r\n                                                                     ~e~!@\r\n                                                                     ~n to her, (Id., pg.\r\n                                                                    ~\r\ns).                                                             ~\r\n                                              II.             ·~\r\n                          ARGUMENTANDAUTHO~\r\n       Given the truly egregious nature of this      case:~ Farmer and her undersigned\r\ncounsel believe it's both necessary and     approp~«fc, bluntly respond to the defenses\r\nasserted in Defendants' instant M/MSJ,       base~on five (5) critically important issues.\r\n                                               ~\r\nFirst, in Defendants' Motion to        Dismi~(ttey   only infer a two (2) year limitations\r\n\r\ndefense, per Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code      ~~003(a), yet the Court should note how strange\r\nit is that Defendants never once ~at statute, merely discussing case law applying it.\r\n\r\nIf they are so confident of its   ~9-cation, why would they be so coy? Obviously, because\r\nin both law and equity,   ~~3(a) does not apply. Instead, this case is clearly governed\r\nby the provisions of~v. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.0045(a), which provides for an\r\n                     ·~©r\r\napplicable five   ~~ar limitations period, pursuant to which Ms. Farmer's claims are\r\nmanifestly~~ asserted.        Second, even if § 16.003(a) did control, which is not the\r\n\r\ncase, .that statute's two (2) year limitation period has been tolled under the doctrine of\r\n\r\nfraudulent-concealment. Third, even if§ 16.003(a) applied and had been timely asserted\r\n\r\nas a basis for dismissal, neither of which is the case, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\r\n\r\nis not timely, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 91.a3(a). Fourth, in Defendants' Traditional\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               12\r\n\fMotion for Summary Judgment, virtually all of the factual assertions are at stark\r\n\r\nvariance with the appalling \"Factual Basis for Guilty Plea,\" as contained in the Plea\r\n\r\nAgreement Morris has now entered into in his federal criminal prosecution, (Response\r\n\r\nEx. G). The total facts of this case literally cry out for a jury trial of Ms. Farmer's claims.\r\n\r\nFifth, Defendants' attempt to fit this case within the parameters of ~CHRA is a\r\n                                                                  ~@)\r\ncomplete distortion of that law. Ms. Farmer is not making an(Jl'ort of workplace\r\n\r\ncomplaint; she was sexually abused, molested and photograp#ude by Morris, after\r\n\r\nher drugged her unconscious in a hotel room in New J ersel!_f\r\n\r\n       The fact that the instant M/MSJ has been very r~ssionally prepared is a fitting\r\n                                                          ~\r\ntribute to opposing counsel's fine professional    rep~on. But, its glossy polish should\r\nnot in any way distract the Court from the     harib~th\r\n                                                 ~~\r\n                                                        that Morris is a convicted sexual\r\n\r\npredator who, on the one hand, will no     do~ll the federal court how contrite he is at\r\nhis pending February 27,    2015   sentenc~for crimes against Ms. Farmer specifically,\r\nwhile here, he is the same smug, a~ant bully who drugged and abused Ms. Farmer\r\n\r\nand numerous other       victims 1~ and denying as strongly as ever. How utterly\r\ncontradictory that he will b~~doubtedly remorseful to Ms. Farmer in the court where\r\n                            rg~\"'\r\nhe faces federal prison ~ yet, here, he is still denying everything and trivializing Ms.\r\n                      ~\r\nFarmer's humiliati~ his cruel hands. Therefore, Ms. Farmer now addresses each of\r\n\r\nthe forgoing   fi~) issues seriatim, in the fervent hope that this Court will hold\r\nDefendant~~e same accountability here as Morris has been compelled, by the awful\r\nfacts he authored, to submit to in the federal court.\r\n\r\n   A. Ms. Farmer's Claims Are Governed by Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\r\n      16.0045(a)'s Five (5) Year Limitation Period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              13\r\n\f      Ms. Farmer agrees that in her Original Petition on file herein, (Response Ex. A),\r\n\r\nshe has asserted causes of action against Morris based upon the torts of \"intentional\r\n\r\nphysical contact... directly and through the instrumentality of drugs,\" (Id., '1! 10), and\r\n\r\n\"intruding on... seclusion when tak[ing] photographs of [Ms. Farmer] when she was\r\n\r\nunconscious.\" (Id., '1l 12). These were further characterized as claims f~sault, (Id.,     '1f\r\n                                                                   __ e_,rt@\r\nn), and invasion of privacy, (Id., '1!13), as regards Edible.

Code § 16.003(a). ~ver, these claims do not\r\n\r\narise from a punch in the nose, a car wreck or a routin~lip-and-fall. They arise from\r\n                                                       o~F\r\ntruly insidious sexual abuse facts which shock     th~nscious.    Therefore, Ms. Farmer\r\n\r\nvigorously asserts that her claims fall more     re~ably\r\n                                                 ~~\r\n                                                         Within the parameters of Civ.\r\n\r\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 16.0045(a), which    p~s for a five (5) year limitation period in\r\ncases involving sexual abuse; and, it is t~longer period which should control here.\r\n\r\n      Defendants cite a number of R@lles regarding the application of§ 16.003(a)'s two\r\n                               ~'f:J\"\"\r\n(2) year limitation period to ~ion of privacy claims, but a close reading thereof\r\n\r\nreveals them to be   disting\"\"'~ble\r\n                           ~·&<\r\n                                    from Ms.     Farmer's instant claims.

Based upon the com~d logic of this collective authority, two issues\r\n\r\nare presented. First, have Defenda~aived limitations by failing to timely assert it, by\r\n\r\nmeans of a Rule 91a.3(a) moti#econd, even if not, can Ms. Farmer assert a tolling\r\n\r\nexception to § 16.003(a)? ~\"\\ the answer to both questions is emphatically Yes, the\r\n\r\ninstant Motion to   Dism~~ould be denied.\r\n                     ~\r\n      Prior to the ~~tive date of Rule 91a, (March 1, 2013), Defendants could have\r\n\r\nasserted a limi#ns affirmative defense much like they have attempted here. But,\r\n\r\nunder the   ~~c terms of Rule 91a.3(a), they were procedurally obligated to do so in\r\nconformity therewith. s Factually, such an oversight seems particularly significant\r\n\r\nbecause, since this entire series of appalling events came to light, Morris has steadfastly\r\n\r\n8See Rule 91a.3(a)(motion to dismiss must be filed within \"6o days\" of movant's service with\r\npleading containing allegedly baseless action).\r\n\r\n                                            26\r\n\fdenied every allegation asserted against him. Instead, Defendants now move for\r\n\r\ndismissal ostensibly pursuant to two-year limitations period set out in Civ. Prac. & Rem.\r\n\r\nCode § 16.003(a).9 Such statute does mandate that tort claims based upon \"personal\r\n\r\ninjury\" must be brought \"not later than two years after the day the cause of action\r\n\r\naccrues.\" Id.

However, Ms. Farme~'hstant claims are\r\n\r\nnot time-barred, under the doctrines of equitable             estopp~~/or          the fraudulent\r\n\r\nconcealment doctrine, as will be discussed at length infra.J;fly, while the Defendants'\r\n\r\nhaving pled limitations in their Answer may have preserill.A it as an asserted affirmative\r\n                                                     0~\r\ndefense, 10 subject to tolling as hereinafter discusse~ey waived the right to move to\r\n\r\ndismiss this case on the basis thereof,    pursuantAo~ule 91a.3(a) and the foregoing cases\r\n                                                      0~\r\n\r\napplying such.

W.3d at 798-99. Plaintiffs herein bring no such claim. In the very next paragraph,\r\nthe Court admonishes: \"the TCHRA does not foreclose an assault-based negligence claim arising\r\nfrom independent facts unrelated to sexual harassment.\" Id., at 799· Here, Plaintiffs assert assault\r\nclaims against Morris and negligence claims against Edible for allowing a predator to victimize\r\nthem.

This time, she awoke from being unconscious to\r\n        find Morris' face   p1~ against hers        while she was being sexually assaulted,\r\n\r\n        (Petition ,!12);   UQ\r\n   3. During a    M~o11 trip to Boston, Massachusetts, Morris drugged Plaintiff Stacy\r\n        Stewart~tting au unlmovm substance into her drink, unbeknownst to her.\r\n        Wh~~1e was semi-conscious, Morris attempted to sexually assault her and\r\n        attempted to forcefully remove her clothing, (Petition , 14);\r\n\r\n    4· On the basis of these respective factual allegations, eacll and all of said Plaintiffs\r\n\r\n        claimed that Morris, individually, intentionally caused physical contact directly or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                5\r\n\f       through the instrumentality of drugs, while he knew or reasonably should have\r\n\r\n       known that each Plaintiff would find that contact offensive or provocative;\r\n\r\n    5· Further, each Plaintiff claimed against Edible because the basis for each b·ip arose\r\n\r\n       out of Morris' capacity as President and CEO of Edible and the sup,ervisor of each\r\n\r\n       Plaintiff and the company should be held liable for the       intentio~~rtious acts\r\n       of its principal; (Petition ~~ 18-20, inclusive). However, no ~Wtiff asserted any\r\n\r\n       claim against either Morris, individually, or Edible    aris~t of any contention\r\n       of sexual discrimination. Instead, every claim         a~ arises directly out of\r\n       intentionally tortious conduct of Morris and        l;b~xual     assault of each of the\r\n                                                             ~\r\n       victims; and,                                  Qi/lj?\r\n    6. As a result of these several intentional 0 ~al assault torts, each Plaintiff claims\r\n\r\n       damages for: physical pain, suffeef.nd impairment from tlte time of the\r\n\r\n       incidents described through tria&~tal anguish and anxiety from the time of the\r\n\r\n       incidents through trial; men~guish and anxiety to be experienced in the future;\r\n\r\n       and, loss of earnings   a~ing capacity sustained from the date of each incident\r\n       to time of trial.    ~       Plaintiff also seeks exemplary damages for Morris'\r\n\r\n       outrageous, ma~s and intentional conduct, (Petition~~ 21-26, inclusive).\r\n\r\nAnd, each and all   ~Assault Victims' claims and theh· asserted damages are copiously\r\nsupported by    ~ition testimony obtained in the discovety which has thus far been\r\n               cg\r\nundertal~·ein.7\r\n\r\n1 In Defendants' Plea, the deposition transcripts of the three Assault Victims are appended, as\r\nExhibits \"1\", (Barnett), \"2\", (Hill), and \"3\" (Stewart\"). To avoid confusion, the same exhibits are\r\nadopted and incorporated herein by reference, per Tex. R. Civ. P. 58. Citations thereof are to page\r\nand line. As did Defendants, the Assault Victims set out virtually the same factual summary as\r\nwas contained in their Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. They apologize\r\nfor this seeming imposition upon the Court's time and precious judicial resources, but, feel that\r\nfor completeness and ease of analysis such facts are here relevant as well.\r\n                                                6\r\n\f      In her discovery deposition, Plaintiff Michelle Barnett testified that she is a\r\n\r\nJanuary, 2000 graduate of San Francisco State University, with a bachelor's degree in\r\n\r\nhistory, (10:19-24). She lives in Cypress, Texas with her husband and two children, an 8-\r\n\r\nyear-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, (13:13- 14:2). She resigned from Edible late in\r\n\r\nFebruary, 2012, (12:2-5); having been hired in about June, 2011,     (16~1she became\r\naware of the company from use of its software at a prior job, begin~ about January,\r\n\r\n2009, (17:1-10). She interviewed for her job at Edible with De~~t Hemi Morris and\r\n                                                             o@;i;\r\nhis son Trevor, (20:20-23). She began work at Edible~l\\ugust 1st, 2011, as the\r\n\r\nOperations Office Manager, (24:5-8). She understood j~ravel would be a part of her\r\n\r\njob, (27:13-20). Her first trip for the company w~~lanta, in October, 2011, (29:17-\r\n\r\n25); she was accompanied by Morris, Trevm;, ~ Beth Jackson, (30:1-6). Beth was a\r\n\r\nsoftware implementation specialist, (30:7#· Barnett reported to Defendant Morris,\r\n\r\n(30:13-16). They left on the trip on a Fr&, (30:17-24); and, they returned the following\r\n\r\nSunday, (31:4-7), She flew to Atlan~ herself and stayed in a Marriott hotel; the travel\r\n\r\narrangements having been    m~~ someone else, (31:7-16). Trevor, Morris and Beth\r\nwere already there when s~\\rived at the hotel, (32:6-9).\r\n\r\n       Ms. Barnett weUdinner that Friday night with Trevor and Morris, (34:17-25).\r\n\r\nShe had two alcoh~rinks, (35:3-18). She also went to a buffet dinner on Saturday, with\r\n                oU\r\na lot of peopl~n the trade show, (35:25- 36:10); and, there was drinking there too,\r\n              ©1\r\nalthough~ould not remember what she drank or the number of drinks, although she\r\nassumed it was wine or vodka, her usual choices, (36:10- 37:10). These two dinners were\r\n\r\nthe only occasions when she drank alcohol on that trip, (37:15- 38:6). Both Morris and\r\n\r\nTrevor drank at the Friday night dinner, (38:7-16), and at the Saturday buffet, (38:17-20);\r\n\r\nbut, she could not recall what the two men drank at those functions, (38:15-16, 21-22).\r\n\r\n                                             7\r\n\fShe was not under the influence of alcohol on Friday night, (39:2-8); but, on Saturday\r\n\r\nnight, she did, (39:9-10), She felt \"tipsy\", (39:11-12). She was driven back to the hotelfrom\r\n\r\nthe buffet by Morris, (16-19). Trevor was with them and he might have driven, (39:21-\r\n\r\n40:10). But, she was neither drugged nor had any complaints about that trip, (40:16-25).\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to work, everything was fine, (41:6-8).\r\n                                                                            *\r\n                                                                         ~ri/j\r\n       In response to very adroit q~estioning by seasoned opposin~~sel, Ms. Barnett\r\n\r\nadmitted that she had harassment training at the          compan~~:17-22); and if she\r\nobserved it, she was supposed to report it,        (57:5-10). ~~as given a copy of the\r\n\r\ncompany's \\ITitten harassment policy, (67:2-21); and, s~ew who to report problems\r\n\r\nto, (68:18- 69:23). She went to a \"lunch and      lea1Q~t it, (70:1-11). Early in her time\r\nwith the company, (17 days after beginning), &)).~bserved Andrea Farmer at work when\r\n\r\nshe appeared to be intoxicated, and       s~ed Beth about it, (65:12- 66:7). She\r\nunderstood the policy and what       wor~ce        sexual harassment was, which included\r\n\r\nunwanted sexual advance, touc~~~ents, (70:15- 71:8), She understood the policy\r\n\r\napplied to anyone she worked~~ (71:12-23). But, very importantly, she did not feel that\r\n\r\nthe policy had an effect re~'j,ng the president of the company, Morris, (73:25-74:8). In\r\n\r\nfact, she expressly   fel~~ could not be protected if the sexual harassment came from\r\nMorris, (74:19);   s~~r she was attacked in New Orleans, she decided to not to report it\r\nto the compa~ich she believed would be futile, (75:7-16); and, instead she reported\r\n\r\nit to the ~74:23- 75:1). However, even that report was not made until the following\r\n\r\nFebruary, (75:2-3), three month after she was attacked in New Orleans, because it took\r\n\r\nher that long to sum up the courage to do sol\r\n\r\n       In this regard, it is imperative that the Court understand two critical aspects of\r\n\r\nsuch testimony. First, the deposition of Ms. Barnett was not to preserve her trial\r\n\r\n                                              8\r\n\ftestimony; rather it was for discovery pUl'poses only. Undersigned counsel for Ms.\r\n\r\nBarnett reserved all question until time of trial, (281:19-21). Thus, all of her testimony\r\n\r\nwas in response only to the questions opposing counsel artfully chose to ask. Second, even\r\n\r\nso, during her protracted deposition, which began at 9:33am, (6:1), and concluded more\r\n\r\nthan seven hours later at 4:36 pro, (281:25), the magnitude of what    ha~ to her and\r\nthe devastatingly traumatic effect it had upon her come vividly thr~ven in response\r\n\r\nonly to wily interrogation by opposing counsel. In the face of ~right physical attack\r\n\r\nby company president and CEO Morris, all of the normal ru~arding workplace sexual\r\n\r\nharassment went completely out the window.         Therefo~o hold Ms. Barnett to solely\r\nthose rules in analyzing this case can only serve tQvi/fl:a manifestly gross injustice, The\r\n\r\nsuperb skills of opposing counsel in framing      h~inquiries   simply cannot be allowed to\r\n                                                  ~\r\nmask over the horrific nature of Monis'~edations and the injuries it proximately\r\n\r\ncaused.                                 ~\r\n       About two or three weeks a~the Atlanta trip, Ms. Barnett was asked to travel\r\n\r\nagain, in November, 2011,    (4~~:3); this time to New Orleans, (42:4-5). Morris told\r\nher that the purpose of he~ticipation on this trip was to implement software for Aunt\r\n\r\nSally's Pralines,   (42:6~She was excited about the trip because it was her first client\r\nimplementation, ~-22); and, also it was her first trip there, (77:13-17). Morris made\r\n                o(\\J\r\nthe travel   arr~ments, (57:24-25), They departed on November 141h, 2011, in the\r\n              (Ql\r\nafternoo~:17-22); she flew ·with Morris, (58:23-24), on Southwest, (58:25- 59:2). She\r\nthough it was unusual that the trip details were not given to her until just before the trip,\r\n\r\n(59:3-21), She asked Morris about it and he told her not to wony and seemed annoyed\r\n\r\nthat she asked, (59:22- 60:2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              9\r\n\f       They left on a Monday, (60:12-13); she and Morris drove separately from work to\r\n\r\nthe airport, (60:14-25). On the flight to New Orleans, she sat next to Morris, (77:20-25;\r\n\r\n78:22-24; 79:3-9). During that flight both she and Morris had one drink, hers a red wine,\r\n\r\n(79:9-24). Once they arrived, Morris rented a car, (81:25- 82:2), and they drove to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecked them both in, (82:3-25). Then, they went up to their\r\n                                                                          *\r\nMarriot hotel in the French Quarter, (8o:8-2o). When they arrived a~~otel, Morris\r\n\r\n                                                                 res~Qe rooms, on the\r\n                                                                  o(lj\r\nsame floor, (83:1-23). They had rooms on the concierge floor, (~11); and, this was the\r\n\r\nfirst time she had ever been to a concierge lounge,   (81:12-1~ere, the hotel provided a\r\nTV, hor d'oeuvres, and drinks, (81:18-22). By the time   ~~et in the lounge it was early\r\n                                                     >)}l~\r\nevening, (84:2-8); and, they stayed there about 30'V tes or less, (84:9-13). She went to\r\n\r\na setup buffet and obtained some appetizers on~@ate, (84:18-19), and she poured herself\r\n                                              '\"'~\r\na vodka soda drink, (84:20-23), at a self-~catt, (85:2-14). However, she only drank\r\n\r\nabout half of it, (86:16-19).           ~\r\n       That day, before arrivingJR\"'~41ounge, Ms. Barnett had eaten breakfast, a salad\r\n\r\nfor lunch and two bags of   pea~~ the plane, (85:16-25);, then, in the lounge, she had\r\nthe appetizers,   (85:19-21).~e Morris arrived in the lounge, they only stayed there a\r\nshort time,   (86:12-16).~9ris wanted to go to a restaurant for dinner and he made to-go\r\n                    ~\r\ncup drinks to take ~e drive there, (86:19- 87:10). Morris poured the remaitung half on\r\n\r\nher drink into  ~fo-go cup and then he added to it, (87:9-16); and, he prepared a to-go\r\ndrink for~lftoo, (88:4-5). Importantly, Morris took her drink from her to make her\r\n\r\nto-go cup drink, (88:6-9); and, during the time he made it, he went behind her so that she\r\n\r\ncould not see what he was doing, (88:6-20). They did not have reservations, (89:7-18);\r\n\r\nso, they then wentto Mr. B's for dinner, which was across the streetfrom the hotel, (88:19-\r\n\r\n89:6). There was no wait at the restaurant and they were seated immediately, (89:19-25).\r\n\r\n                                            10\r\n\f       Ms. Barnett only had a sip or two of her to-go drink because it was very strong,\r\n\r\n(90:8-11). When they went into the restaurant, the drinks were taken from them, (89:24-\r\n\r\n90:7); so, they ordered more drinks, hers again being a vodka soda, (90:15-18). Up until\r\n\r\nthat time, Manis had done nothing assaultive, (91:25- 92:6); but, near the end oftheir\r\n\r\nmeal, significant events occurred, (93:8-11), During the course of her     di~\"'toth of them\r\ndrank and she consuming a total ofthree drinks, (92:10-24); the  d~Qasting about two\r\nhours, (92:25- 93:1). Near the end of dessert, a waitress asked ~~fthey wanted more\r\n                                                                   o@;J)\r\ndrinks, and she said no, (93:8-14); however, she excused h~o go to the restroom and\r\n\r\nwhen she returned to the table, two drinks were           sit~ere, one for her, (93:14-16;\r\n95:13-16). Morris claimed the waitress had just        br~em, (93:19-24). Since she didn't\r\nwant this new drink, she only had a few sips of~'bJ4:12-24); then she dumped it out into\r\n\r\nher water glass, (94:21-25; 95:17-24), bec~e didn't want it, (95:22-25).\r\n       Then, they left to walk on          Bou~ Street to look at the      customer's building,\r\n\r\n(96:20-24); but they never got th~doing into a piano bar called PJ's instead, (96:25-\r\n\r\n97:7). (She later corrected        t!Q~e to Pat O'Brien's, (145:15- 146:2)).Going in was\r\nMorris' idea, (97:8-21); sh~tipsywhen they arrived there, (97:22-24). Morris ordered\r\n\r\nmore drinks even      tho~1fe did not ask her if she wanted one of, if she did, what kind,\r\n                  ~\r\n(98:18-25), The dt~he received, she later learned, was a \"Hurricane\", (99:1-15). She\r\n                 nq;~G                 .\r\ndidn't refuse   ~'e;;lft•ink,   but she felt Morris was intentionally trying to get her to drink\r\n\r\nmore tha~vanted to, (99:20- 100:4), because she had specifically told him at the end\r\n\r\nof dinner that she didn't want to drink more because they had to see the elient in the\r\n\r\nmoming, (100:5-10). But, she felt compelled to dt·ink more at the piano bar because she\r\n\r\nwas with her boss and she was trying to \"go along\", (100:17-21; 101:19-23). The Hmricane\r\n\r\nwas a very big drink, (100:22- 101:8); and, she didn't !mow he was ordering it and\r\n\r\n                                                  11\r\n\ftherefore didn't have a chance to say she didn't want it, (102:6-21). Once it came, she a\r\n\r\nthird to a half ofit, (103:6-7), because it was very \"alcohol intensive\", (103:8-13); but, even\r\n\r\nso, while she was again in the restroom, Morris ordered another one, (103:16-23). This\r\n\r\ntime, she told him directly she didn't want another and asked him why he had ordered it,\r\n\r\n(104:21-24); in response, he told her to drink the new, full Hurricane     a~ moved the\r\nhalf-full one away from her, (104:25- 105:3)!                          ~a\r\n                                                       s~~ compelled to drink\r\n       She again told him she didn't want it, (105:6-8); but,\r\n\r\nsome of it and she drank about a quarter of it, (106:2-~e later learned tbat tbe\r\n\r\nprinciple alcohol in such drinks is Bacardi 151 proof ru~o6:7-17); and, she could not\r\n\r\nrecall ever before having drunk such potent    alcoh~~:l-6). She has no recollection of\r\nleaving the piano bar; she can only remember ani'llrm pulling her out of her chair and that\r\n                                                 {!?\r\nis the last thing she remembers, (105:17~08:9-13). Later, she discovered the next\r\n\r\nmorning tbat it was Morris, who had p~ on her arm, (108:18-23). The next thing she\r\n\r\nremembers is Morris pulling he~~er off, (109:19-22); then, she remembers running\r\n\r\nto the bathroom in her hotel~ to throw up, (110:1-5; 110:25- 111:3). She remembers\r\n\r\nsaying, 'Oh, this isn't hap~g to me.\" (111:7-9); and she remembers someone pulling\r\n\r\nher clothing off and sh@fearful for her safety, (111:10-14). But, she doesn't have a vivid\r\n\r\nrecollection of   ~~g else, (116:10-12). And, it is here that the real horror of her\r\nexperience   b~es       exquisitely clear. This good and decent woman was rendered\r\n\r\nincohere~~the intentional drugging of Morris; and, she is left now to forever wonder\r\nabout what vile things he did to her while she was unconscious. Did he rape her? Sodomize\r\n\r\nher? Photograph her naked as he did others? Share those salacious photos with others?\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are extensive and the implications foul and odious. And, despite\r\n\r\nDefendants' persistent assertions to the contrary, her awful victimization is not erased\r\n\r\n                                               12\r\n\fbecause she has no memory of it; in the same way that a surgeon's malpractice blunders\r\n\r\nare not negated by the fact that the patient was asleep when his tort occurred!\r\n\r\n       In the morning, she called her husband, (116:13-15). She told him about the\r\n\r\nprevious evening and that she felt uncomfmtable and didn't want to go see the client,\r\n\r\n(117:12-15). Her husband advised her to go to the client's in a   separa~~nd to write\r\nwhat she could remember down and to tell Morris that what had ha~gd made her very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable, (117:18- 118:1); which she did, (118:2-3).   Lat~ notes upset her so\r\n                                                      oci@\r\nmuch she threw them out, (118:4- 119:3). Opposing coun~essed Ms. Baxnett about\r\n\r\nwhy she didn't call 911 or otherwise report that night; h~e said she couldn't be sure a\r\n\r\ncrime had been committed, 122:3-23); and, she     ~nted to go home and make the\r\nevening go away, (123:12-18). But, she didn't gg~me immediately; she prepared herself\r\n                                                  ~\r\nfor the day ahead even though she didn't ~o, (123:19- 124:25); and, then she texted\r\n\r\nMorris that she was uncomfortable ab~he previous night and she wanted to go home\r\n\r\nand would get herself to the airpo~~h5:1-4; 126:10). Morris' breathtakingly deceitful\r\n\r\nresponse was to show up     im~ly at her door indicating that he was very unhappy,\r\n(126:11-25)! He knocked ~r door, but at first she didn't answer because she wanted\r\n\r\nhim to go away,     (127:~but, he kept knocking \"like forever\", (127:4-5). Through the\r\ndoor, she told   him~~ away, (127:11-14); but, as she entered the hallway with her packed\r\nbag, he was   st~e, so she had to talk to him, (127:13-25),\r\n       81~ him she was uncomfortable and wanted to go home, (127:25- 128:5); she\r\nwas not 100% sure it had been Morris; but, she felt that he had assaulted her and tried to\r\n\r\nruin her clothing, (128:13-25). She was certain she was with him and left the piano bar\r\n\r\nwith him, (129:1); and, she felt he had done this to her, (129:7-9). In response to her\r\n\r\ndiscomfort, suave predator that he is, he told her he didn't understand her concern\r\n\r\n                                             13\r\n\fbecause she had come to his room and laid in his bed, where he didn't touch her, (129:18-\r\n\r\n20); but, she adamantly disagreed with this version of the events because she didn't even\r\n\r\nknow where his room was, (129:21-24; 131:9-14); and, she told him so, (131:6-14). He\r\n\r\nresponded that he \"respected her and didn't want to lose her\", 131:15-18). Very\r\n\r\ninterestingly, Morris gave her back the sweater he had taken         o~~ffering no\r\nexplanation as to why he had it, (136:14-19). He asked her to go see it,Yient, and though\r\n\r\n                                                          ~he did, (132:11-12).\r\nshe didn't want to, she finally agreed to do so, (132:1-10);\r\n\r\nHowever, because of their conversation tlley were late arr~t the client's, so Morris\r\n\r\nlied and said tlley had problems getting the car out oft~rage, (134:1-7).\r\n\r\n       Defendants, just as they did in their MSJ,   ~~uch of the fact that Ms. Bamett\r\ntestified that her claims against Morris arise ftQ~ns role as her supervisor in the course\r\n                                              ~\r\nand scope of employment, (137:18-21); b~ectfully, she is not a legal expert and has\r\n\r\nno basis to make such a legal assertion~ey also focus on her testimony that her claims\r\n\r\nconcern her employment and M~$~onduct in a work context, (198:11-16); but, again,\r\n\r\nshe is not qualified to make   s~etermination. Ms. Barnett is the highly traumatized\r\nvictim of a vicious assault ~1e is not a qualified expe1t on Texas or federal employment\r\n\r\nlaw. Moreover, Defen~9offer not one word of explanation as to how drugging a woman\r\n                    ~\r\nat dinner for pu~s of sexual molestation relates in any conceivable way to job\r\n               o(!:J'\r\nperformance ~~rkplace conditions; for the obvious reason that it does not.\r\n\r\n       W~e returned home, she talked to her husband, (145:7-9); because she just\r\ncouldn't understand how she went from being in control of herself to having no\r\n\r\nrecollection, (145:10-14). She decided then she needed to look for another job, (146:8-14);\r\n\r\nand, she began to look for one, (146:15-16). She liked Beth Jackson, but didn't trust her\r\n\r\nand tlley did not discuss what happened, (147:22- 148:10); and, she not discuss it with\r\n\r\n                                            14\r\n\fany other Edible employees until a few weeks later, when she talked with a new employee,\r\n\r\nErin Bjork, (148:11-22). She specifically told her she thought she had been drugged and\r\n\r\nthat Morris had attempted to sexually assault her, (149:25- 150:18). She also told her\r\n\r\nhusband that, (150:19-21). She made no attempt to preserve a urine sample or other\r\n\r\nevidence because she just didn't have the opportunity to do so,\r\n\r\nfurther conversations with Morris about the matter until about\r\n                                                                         *\r\n                                                                   (151:~. She had no\r\n                                                               a~M later, which he\r\ninitiated, (153:21-25); he said he was concerned for her and ~~plied she was fine,\r\n                                                            o!?@\r\n(154:1-7). A similar exchange occurred on another occasio~4:8-14). She just tried to\r\n\r\navoid him, (155:11-19), unless contact with him was re~®a, (155:20-22).\r\n\r\n      Ms. Barnett never discussed the matter     wi~v employee Michelle Byrd, who\r\ndealt with sexual harassment matters,   becau~~e     felt it would be unsafe to do so as\r\n\r\nMorris was the company president, 158:~9:2); thus the anti-harassment plan was\r\n\r\n\"unsafe\" for her, (159:9-24). She thougl~e idea that Morris would lose his job while she\r\n\r\nkept hers was ridiculous,   (159:3-~ owned the company and she was a hireling, and\r\nany complaint she made wo4e gone directly to him, (160:1-24). After Morris had\r\n\r\nbeen arrested for the    cri~~ charges against him,    (including one flowing from her\r\n\r\ncomplaint), she told   M~~nk Lettieri, with her former employer, what happened to her,\r\n                   ~\r\n(163:4-8). After r~ng her assault to the FBI, she had a difficult time, (170:6-7). But,\r\n\r\nshe couldn't j~it until she found another job because she couldn't afford it, (172:21-\r\n\r\n173:1). L~~en she did quit, she needed family assistance to make ends meet, (187:15-\r\n\r\n22). She finally talked to Keri Hill about her assault, at the suggestion of Erin Bjorl<,\r\n\r\n(173:8-16). Their mutual allegations were remarkably similar: both traveled with Morris\r\n\r\nearly in their tenure with the company; both met Morris in a hotel concierge lounge; both\r\n\r\nreceived to-go cups from him, containing drinks he had mixed; both completely lost their\r\n\r\n                                            15\r\n\fmemories; both had no history of excessive drinking; and, both were terribly\r\n\r\nuncomfortable about what happened to them, (174:14-25; 175:1-6). Ms. Hill specifically\r\n\r\ntold her about Morris pressing his face to hers and telling her what a good employee she\r\n\r\nwas and that he wanted her to be with him for a long time, (175:11-14). However, even\r\n\r\nwhen she resigned fl'Om the company, she did not give the attack as a ~~because she\r\nfeared for her physical safety, (190:7-16).                          ~U\r\n       After she left the company, she sought unemployment ~s and told the Texas\r\n\r\nWorkforce Commission she had been a crime victim,           ~4-24),       (not a victim of\r\n\r\nworkplace discrimination). She told them all she coulcb~mber, (193:22-194:6); she is\r\n\r\nnow certain she was drugged by Morris because      sQ~consciousness and later when he\r\nwas arrested, blackout drugs were reported in~ news to be on him, (194:18- 195:19).\r\n                                               ~\r\nAgain, opposing counsel pressed Ms. Bar~ the fact that she really has no memOl'y of\r\n\r\nwhat happened to her, (199:4-     200:1~ut, that speaks to the efficacy of his assault\r\ntechnique, it doesn't negate its oai{Vce or legitimate claims arising therefrom. Indeed,\r\n\r\nshe eloquently explained tha~ day since the attack, she has suffered panic attacks,\r\n\r\nanxiety, fear, panic, bein~~~mt from her family, having to think about this \"shit\" every\r\n\r\nsingle day and not   b~~ere for her children when they need her, (201:12-21; 204:6-\r\n            .        ~·\r\n20); for whiCh s~~s seen the FBI counselor, (203:1- 204:3). She has also lost work,\r\n\r\n(204!23-25).~~efore,         her testimony completely supports the prima facie\r\n\r\nassaultf~y claims she herein asserts.\r\n       Plaintiff Keri Hill testified in her eight and a half hour long discovery deposition,\r\n\r\n(in which undersigned counsel for Ms. Hill again reserved all questions until time of trial),\r\n\r\nin relevant part, that she lives in Houston, v.1th her husband and two children, a 13-year-\r\nold son and a 5-year-old daughter, (5:15- 6:8). She graduated from Texas Tech University\r\n\r\n                                              16\r\n\fwith a bachelor's degree in social work, (27:14-23; 28:4-5). She left her employment at\r\n\r\nEdible on April 30, 2012, (20:3-8); and, did not find a new job until August 2, 2012,\r\n\r\n(18:10-12). She first learned of a job at Edible in November, 2011, (31:13-15). Slightly later,\r\n\r\nshe had an interview and met Defendant Morris, (37:10-15). They hired her, but before\r\n\r\nshe began worldng there, on December 12, 2011, (40:3-4), she            att~their office\r\nChristmas party, (39:17-25). There was drinldng at the party,(43:1~~~.\r\n       About a month after she began worldng there, a u·ip to ~qork came up, (45:9-\r\n                                                                o@;j)\r\n19). Morris made all the travel arrangements, (48:6-7). ~ flew to New York on a\r\n\r\nSunday, (50 :12-14), and she drove herself to the airport~~et Morris in the Continental\r\n\r\nPresident's Club, (50:21- 51:5). She got to the   airp~~ and ate lunch by herself, (51:10-\r\n17). As soon as they entered the VIP lounge, 1~s ordered two Bloody Marys, (52:1-5);\r\n\r\nMorris obtained the drinks at a bar and ~ht hers to her, (52:10-15). The choice of\r\n\r\ndrinks was Morris', (53:7-12); and, she ~nd up drinking two of them, over about 30-45\r\n\r\nminutes, both ordered by Morri~~6- 55:1). She also ate a plate of snacks during that\r\n\r\ntime, (55:2-4). On the    plane,~    sat next to Henri in first class, (55:7-10); as he had\r\n\r\nupgraded her to ticket,   (5~0). During the flight, she drank two vodka and cranberry\r\ndrinks, 57:22- 58:9);   ll[~espite having four drinks during that day, she felt fine, (58:6-\r\n12), as she also   at~~al\r\n                   o{»\r\n                          during the flight, (58:13-25).\r\n\r\n       When ~~ane landed, they obtained a rental car, (59:10- 60:12); which Morris\r\n\r\ngot to pi~~d in doing so she felt he was showing off, (60:16- 61:9). Then, they drove to\r\n\r\na Marriott hotel, which was so close to the airport she thought it would have been just as\r\n\r\neasy to walk there from the airport, (61:15- 62:1). When they checked in, Morris was very\r\n\r\njovial, knew many of the employees by name and went behind the counter to hug several\r\n\r\npeople, (63:3-8); from this she assumed he traveled there a lot, (63:20-24). During such,\r\n\r\n                                               17\r\n\fMorris advised her that Beth Jackson would also be arriving, (63:8-17), He checked both\r\n\r\nof them in, (64:11-20); they had rooms on the same floor, (64:21-22). They got to their\r\n\r\nrooms at about 5 pro, (65:13-15). Since she had never been to Manhattan before, Morris\r\n\r\nsaid he would drive her there for diner, (65:18- 66:23). She wanted to see the lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad time, (68:10-24). Weirdly, there was a single photo of it in\r\n                                                                          *\r\nCenter skating rink, (67:10-20).; and, since there was business plann~t night, they\r\n\r\n                                                                   he~Yne the next day,\r\nbut, she had no memory of being there, (111:1- 5).              ·~\r\n                                                                ~\r\n                                                           ..~~\r\n       Before dinner, Ms. Hill called her husband to tell ~e had arrived safely and\r\n\r\nthat they were going into the city to eat at a deli, (69: 1•~and, she also talked with her\r\n\r\nkids, (70:3-7). After that, as instructed, she met   ~in the hotel's concierge lounge,\r\n(70:22). There were a Jot of snacks there and sh&li1•anted some; but, Morris told her not\r\n                                                  ~&\r\nto fill up because they wonld be eating a b~er, (71:16-22). Dming that time, Morris\r\n\r\nordered two vodl{a and cranberry and ~ixed both his and hers and handed her drink\r\n\r\nto her, (71:21-25), She drank abo];!t~# of her drink, (72:14-15); when Morris told her it\r\n\r\nwas time to leave for dinner,   ~~went up to the bar and got two to-go cups, (72:16-\r\n25). He said the cups won~em take their drinks in the car, (73:1-4), Importantly, he\r\n\r\ntook her half-empty   d~from her and replaced it 11oith a new drink which she didn't\r\n                  ~\r\nwant and didn't a~r; then he turned his back to her and made the to-go cup drinks\r\n\r\nwhile she coul#see what he was doing, (73:7-11). She knew drinking in a car was not a\r\n\r\ngood ide~he said she wouldn't have done it herself, but, she was 11oith her boss in a\r\n\r\nnew job, so she didn't protest about it, (73:22- 74:24). Morris brought three cups, on\r\n\r\nwhich he had written his name on one, her name on another and \"spare\" on the third,\r\n\r\nwhich struck her as ve1y odd, (74:25-75!4). Morris carried two and she carried her own,\r\n\r\n(75:8-10); and, they walked to the ear, (75:11- 76:1). She had two sips from her drink\r\n\r\n                                             18\r\n\fduring this walk, (76:2-7). After that, she has absolutely no recollection of the entire\r\n\r\nevening, until she remembered trying to get out of the car back at the hotel, much later,\r\n\r\nand trying to find her room, (77:1-19). She has a vague recollection of getting into the car\r\n\r\nand the car moving, but none of anything else that night, (78:2-25).\r\n\r\n       She has a one-two second flash memory of trying to get out      of~' (79:9-18).\r\n                                                              (79:2~-f. She remembers\r\nShe can't recall eating or drinking anything that entire night,\r\n\r\ntrying to find her room because she felt uncomfortable and lo~~ couldn't figure out\r\n\r\nwhere she was, (80:1-13). She felt like a little ldd who was ~and dreaming; saying, \"I\r\n\r\nhad zero ability or control over what was happening, a~ remember that I don't know\r\n\r\nwhere I was, but I remember that I wet my     panQ~5-10). The next recollection she\r\nhas is standing in her hotel room, with    Mo~~tanding       over her saying he had been\r\n\r\nlooking for her, (82:15-20). She had no~ how he got into her room, (82:21-22).\r\n\r\nOpposing counsel asks her if it is true tl~orris was expressing concern for her, and she\r\n\r\nagrees that this is what he said, ~V 84:6); but, with due respect to opposing counsel\r\n\r\nfor doing his job, the total pict~~ich emerges from this nightmare is horrific. Ms. Hill,\r\n\r\na wife, mother and     colle~duate, on her first company trip, has been reduced to a\r\nterrified, confused,   in~qnent mess because she was drugged into insensibility; and,\r\nhere is her   attacl~~pressing his crocodile tear concern for the awful predicament he\r\n                 0~\r\nhas malicious~tentionally put her in! Bluntly, it's difficult to imagine a more fiendish\r\n\r\nexploita~~ trust or the dignity of another human being. Moreover what he did to her\r\non still another trip only confirms her darkest fears of what he did to her on this one.\r\n\r\n       Ms. Hill remembers asking him to leave, (84:14-15); he responded by telling her to\r\n\r\nsit on the bed and watch TV with him so she would feel better, (84:16-21). She refused\r\n\r\nand asked him again to leave, and he did. (85:5-8). But, he likely did so because by then,\r\n\r\n                                             19\r\n\fshe had her husband on the phone, (85:9-13). She was later told by him that she said\r\n\r\nMorris was in her room and she had walked into the bathroom because she felt very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable that he wanted to stay to watch TV. Her husband told her to ask Morris to\r\n\r\nleave; but, she has no direct memory ofthat conversation, (85:14-25). At that point, she\r\n\r\ndidn't feel physically violated or in danger, (86:14-25); but the next   ~~~g, Monday,\r\nMorris made a comment about her drinking the previous          evenin~Y she felt terribly\r\nembarrassed that she had ruined her new job, (89:2-6); so,       ~pologized profusely,\r\n                                                               0~\r\n(89:7-8; 89:22- 90:3; 90:16-19). Morris told her he had~\"Relp her walk around the\r\n\r\nprevious evening, but, she had no memory of that,      (89•~~·\r\n      After breakfast, they went to see the client,   ~~24); and, she was functional that\r\nday, (93:17-20). Late that afternoon, they   retu~:o the hotel and Morris decided he\r\n                                               ~\r\nwanted to take her back into Manhattan a~or dinner, which he did, (94:3-11). Before\r\n\r\nthey went, she again talked to her hus~ and apologized as she had never before had\r\n\r\nan \"alcohol issue\" before,    (94:~~).      Her husband was perplexed about what had\r\n\r\nhappened because that was n~bo she was\", (95:10-21). Even then, she didn't believe\r\n\r\nMorris was responsible fo~ previous night, (95:22- 96:1); but after her trip with him\r\n\r\nto Chicago, she   compW~ changed her mind, (96:2-6), However, that second night in\r\nManhattan was     tl.~ntfnl, (96:24- 97:12); although when he again brought up the\r\n                o\\0)\r\nprevious   eve~~ she told him what happened to           her was scary as it was so out of\r\n\r\ncharact~~er,        (97:17-21), Also, while she did agree to have a beer in the concierge\r\n\r\nlounge, Morris offered to make her stronger drinks a couple of times which this time she\r\n\r\nflatly refused, (98:10-18).\r\n\r\n       The next day they worked with another client and Beth ,Tackson arrived at the\r\n\r\nairport late that day and theywentto pick her up, (102:23-103:16). She met Beth the first\r\n\r\n                                             20\r\n\ftime then, (103:20-21). That evening, she, Morris and Beth met in the hotel restaurant for\r\n\r\ndinner; but, during the meal, Morris left and when he retumed, he had drinks he said he\r\n\r\ngot from the concierge lounge, which she again thought was vety odd, (105:23- 106:6,\r\n\r\n106:23-25). She left the next morning by herself and didn't see Morris again until later\r\n\r\nthat week, (107: 10-19).

Hill volunteered,\r\n                                                              0   \"@,\r\n(109:19-110:18). This trip was in February and they flew o~tnwest, (113:6-12). At the\r\n\r\nairport, she ate lunch and had a beer, (114:4-17). She ~rum and coke on the plane,\r\n\r\n(115:5-6), and Morris had a drink too, (116:3-4).#when she went to the restroom,\r\n\r\nMorris ordered her another drink and was po~ it into a new cup when she returned,\r\n                                              ~\r\n(117:8-21). After that, she has no more r~ctions of the rest of the day, (119:10-16),\r\n\r\nexcept that she could recall that the ne,~ink looked \"muddy\" or \"foggy\" and that Morris\r\n\r\npoured it really quickly and hand~e first cup off to the flight attendant, (119:19-23;\r\n\r\n120:3-15; 120:24). She     finally~ to be conscious of her surroundings again about 10\r\npm that night, (121: 20-25~ has flash memories of Morris had her hands intertwined\r\n\r\nor locked together wit~ris', (122: 1-6); and, this may have happened a couple of times,\r\n\r\n(123:1-2). She   als~embers Morris' face being pressed against the side of her face and\r\nher feeling   v~~comfortable physically and emotionally. He told her she had a long\r\ncareer a~t she was a valuable member of his team, and he \"had ahold of my hand\r\n\r\nthat was nowrubbingin my vaginal area as well as up and down my leg.\" (123:9-20; 124:1-\r\n\r\n8). This contact was outside of her clothing, (123:24-25). During this attack, she got\r\n\r\nphysically sick several times and she felt the need to try to get up and get away from where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             21\r\n\fshe was, and she again felt like a little kid, (124:19-25). When his face was pressed agaulSt\r\n\r\nhers, she also recalled seeing a square condom packet, (132:1-7).\r\n\r\n       This time, she was certain she had been drugged because she was on a business\r\n\r\ntrip in the daytime and she got on a plane to go to Peoria, yet she was there without any\r\n\r\nmemory of how she got there; and it definitely was not a dream or      nigh~(125:7-20).\r\nShe firmly believes her drink was drugged, (126:9-10). And,  a~JlVrorris' criminal\r\nattorney, Chip Lev.>is admitted in a news broadcast that MolT~~s arrested with such\r\n\r\ndrugs on his person, (126:20-25). Her next recollection w~g in her hotel room and\r\n\r\nMorris was there too and a to-go cup was on her dres~~he asked Morris to leave and\r\n\r\nhe did so, (129:17-23). Based upon his         druggi~~ on the flight on this trip, she\r\nconcluded that he had drugged her before in th~ew York concierge lounge before they\r\n                                                  ~\r\nwent to dinner, (130:14-24). The govern~ld her that tests confirmed such drugs on\r\n\r\nMorris' person, (131:10-16).                ~\r\n       The next day was spentwi~client, (135:9-10); and throughout the day, Morris\r\n\r\nmade several sarcastic      comme~at the trip took a long time because \"they had to stop\r\nseven times\" for her, (135~). That night, they went to dinner \\lith the client and she\r\n\r\nhad a glass of wine,   (~~19). On the way to dinner, Morris grabbed her hand and she\r\npulled it back   qui~ecause she felt extremely uncomfortable and he told her she was\r\nbeing silly,   (1f:'9:).   Then, as they entered the restaurant, he told her he would hold her\r\n\r\nhand du~nner under the table, but she ignored him, (137:18-23). When they got back\r\n\r\nto the hotel, he asked her to go to the casino. When she refused, he got very frustrated and\r\n\r\nsarcastic and began whining and pouting that he would have to sit by himself, so she\r\n\r\nrelented and said she would have one drink with him, (138:6-15). They went into a bar\r\n\r\nand Morris ordered two drinks; but, when they came, he took them behind a dessert menu\r\n\r\n                                                22\r\n\fwith his back to her, so she walked over and got her drink, a glass of wine, and sat down.\r\n\r\nHe was on the phone. (138:16- 139:5). She was worried he might do something to it,\r\n\r\n(139:10-15). She knew at that point that something was seriously wrong, but she had\r\n\r\ntrouble \"getting her head around it\", (139:16-23).\r\n\r\n       Even so, she was scared to report what had happened,     (140:4~~d, she was\r\nvery confused and trying hard to make sense of what had   actu~appened to her,\r\n(140:17-22). However, she told her husband about it when sh~ome, (140:11-16). In\r\n\r\nthe meantime, she went with Morris back to Chicago fro~·ia to see another client,\r\n\r\n(141:2-25); and, there were no more problems,        (142~®). When she did talk to her\r\nhusband, he saw a bruise on her arm; but, she    tolQ~he hit a wall because she ·wanted\r\nto \"wrap my head around a much bigger conve~tion that I knew we were going to have\r\n                                              ~\r\nto have,\" (143:12-15). She first noticed th~se when she awoke in Peoria the morning\r\n\r\nafter her bizarre previous day,   (144:7~. Finally, she and her husband discussed the\r\nmatter frankly, (15-17). They m~~unch and she told him she was ve1y upset about\r\n\r\nhaving major memmy losses ~o successive business trips, (145:3-11). He told her that\r\n\r\nwhen they talked on the ~ while she apparently was in the car ·with Morris enroute\r\n\r\nto dinner, her        r?.r;»\r\n                 speec~as      slurred and he was astonished at the extent of her ve1y\r\n                  ~\r\nuncharacteristic ~dng, if that was what the problem was; and even then he told her\r\n\r\nshe might ha «f-in drugged, (145:15- 146:1). She had no recollection of even having that\r\n          ~\r\nphone c~~ation, (146:4-13).\r\n\r\n       She then told her husband all the rest that had happened in both New York and\r\n\r\nChicago; and, he became very sad and upset and suggested that she discuss the matter\r\n\r\nwith a friend of theirs who is a narcotics investigators with the Houston Police\r\n\r\nDepartment, (146:15-24). She did have that conversation and was referred to the FBI,\r\n\r\n                                            23\r\n\f(147:16- 148:9). As a result of that, a sting was arranged with her at the Houston airport,\r\n\r\nso Morris could be arrested, (149:23- 150:3). Not surprisingly, the day after Morris was\r\n\r\narrested, she was placed on leave of absence and less than two weeks later, she was fired,\r\n\r\n(154:23- 155:13). Needless to say, her abrupt termination for reporting Morris' repeated,\r\n\r\ndepraved violations of her stands as profound and eloquent             ~on          of her\r\n\r\napprehensions about ever reporting Morris' conduct. She believ~Wt would be both\r\n\r\npointless and dangerous and she was absolutely right! Since th~~cidents, Ms. Hill has\r\n                                                              o~ci@\r\nsuffered lots of anxiety, panic attacks and \"fear of movem~\"tts7:11-16).\r\n\r\n       Both Monis' civil and criminal lawyers pressed~ Hill for long hours on many\r\n\r\ndetails surrounding these matters; but, while     De~~~s seized upon various aspects of\r\nher answers in their MSJ and continue to do SQ~ the instant Plea, they at the very most\r\n                                                ~\r\npresent only a broad range of relevant fa~out which reasonable minds could differ.\r\n\r\nMs. Hill has pt·esented more than eno~testimony to support her prima facie liability\r\n\r\nallegations. Therefore, the Plea ~·ly defective as a matter of both fact and law and\r\n\r\nshould be denied in all of its ~~Iars.\r\n\r\n       Plaintiff Stacy Stew~stified in relevant part, in her discovery deposition which\r\n\r\nlasted in excess of   fiv~rs, that she lives in Austin, (4:23-24), with her husband and\r\n                 ~\r\ntwo children, \\8~2), a 13-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son, (9:3-12). She\r\nworked at E.:lq,f~\r\n            '§Sy only about six weeks, (11:4-7). She was a software implementation\r\nspeciali~4-15). She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993, with a\r\nbachelor's in business administration, concentrating in business information\r\n\r\nmanagement computing systems, (18:8-19). To get her job at Edible, she interviewed with\r\n\r\nMorris, (21:7-25). The meeting lasted an hour and she also met Trevor Morris and Beth\r\n\r\nJackson, (23:14-18); and, she understood travel would be required in this job, (23:3-10).\r\n\r\n                                             24\r\n\fShe was offered the job there and she accepted, (24:3-10); and, this was in late February,\r\n\r\n2011, (24:12-20).\r\n\r\n       Her testimony in regard to her abuse by Morris is a bit curious in that opposing\r\n\r\ncounsel chose to question her in the context of what she told the FBI when she was\r\n\r\nsubsequently interviewed by them about it; so in transcripted form     i~third-party\r\nfeel. But, in that contest, she stated that she travelled to Boston wit~J·ris to attend the\r\n                                                                  0~\r\nBoston Seafood Show, (46:1-8), on March 18, 2011,          (57:3-~   she went at Morris'\r\n\r\ninvitation, (57:12- 58:8). Morris made all of the travel   ~ments, 59:10-15). They\r\nstayed in a Maniott hotel while there, (61:2-6). At     ~~ouston airport, she drank a\r\nTanqueray & tonic, (62:14-21); and, during the     fl~Boston, she had a glass of wine,\r\n(61:24- 65:7).                                    §!P\r\n       After she arrived in Boston, she ~orris in the lobby and they checked in\r\n\r\ntogether, (63:3-6); then, as   instructed~~met him in the hotel's concierge lounge for\r\ndrinks, (63:10-16). There, she n~~ris, Beth Jackson and Beth's mother, who lives in\r\n\r\nthe Boston a1•ea, {64:2-10 ). S~ another Tanqueray & tonic, (64:8-11). She made that\r\n\r\ndrink herself; but, a short\"'~\"' later Morris made her another one and brought it to her,\r\n                         g~:~;f'''\r\n(64:22- 65:3), She als~ some snacks, (65:19-20; 66:2-4), Then, they went to dinner at\r\n                   ~\r\nLegal Seafood, (~-21). At dinner, she had a glass of wine, (67:8-9). They left the\r\n\r\nrestaurant   at~ 8:45pm because she wanted to walk to an adjacent mall to buy a shirt\r\nbefore t~es closed, (67= 12- 68 :2). From then on, her recollections were very sketchy,\r\n\r\n(69!15-70:1).\r\n\r\n       The next morning, she woke up with a severe hangover, (46:18-19; 47:3-6); and,\r\n\r\nshe went to a nearby mall to look for a Colee and some food to make herself feel better,\r\n\r\n{52:14-16). She explicitly stated that her hangover was caused by Morris' drugging her by\r\n\r\n                                             25\r\n\fputting something in her drink, (73:3-24; 73:25- 75:7). Her hangover felt like she had\r\n\r\nbeen run over by a truck, (75:8-13). She did not see Morris put the substance in her drink,\r\n\r\n(83:25- 842); but, she is certain that he did, (84:3-7).\r\n\r\n       Later that morning, she attended the food show, which lasted all day, (85:3- 86:9).\r\n\r\nWhen they all returned to the hotel, they, (meaning herself, Morris,    ~~ackson and\r\nanother man), again gathered in the concierge lounge, (87:4-    88:~Kere, she had two\r\nTanqueray & tonics, (88:11-17). Manis made the second      dr~ut of her sight and\r\nbrought it to her, (89:4-9; 89:23- 90:4). Then, they went ~~er at a pizza restaurant,\r\n\r\n{90:4-10). Beth's mother joined them at dinner,      (90~>~). There was no drinking at\r\ndinner, (90:22-25); and, she could recall that     s~~·ned to the hotel where Morris\r\ninstructed her to join him in the bar while he :~he others to \"go ahead\", (91:2-9). They\r\n\r\nhad a conversation during which Morris t~r how important she was to the company,\r\n\r\n(92:10-14); then, the conversation turn~~irdlyto another woman's breasts, (92:15-18).\r\n\r\n       Then, Morris went to    ge~~~ for them at the bar; and, after he returned,        he\r\n\r\nbegan to massage her should~92:18-21). This was out of the blue, (48:17-20; 11-14);\r\n\r\nand, it mad.e her very unc~~rtable. But, before she could protest about it, he stopped,\r\n\r\n(49:17-20). Later,   wh~ywent up to their respective rooms, Manis asked if he could\r\n                 ~\r\ncome into her roo~ continue the massage, (44:19- 45:4; 46:1-6; 51:3-9; 93:13-18). She\r\n\r\nquickly   decli~d Morris left, (51:10-15); although she thinks he may have tried to get\r\ninto her~' (93:21-25). During that evening, she had two Tanqueray & tonic drinks,\r\n\r\nboth of which Morris brought to her, (46:9- 47:2). The next morning, she again awoke\r\n\r\nwith a severe hangover, (99:14-18); which she again attributes to being drugged, (101:12-\r\n\r\n17i 101:24- 102:15).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              26\r\n\f      It deeply upsets her that about the first night she no recollections and has no idea\r\n\r\nwhat happened to her; and, on the second night, Morris offensively touched and\r\n\r\npropositioned her, and on both following mornings, she awoke with severe hangovers,\r\n\r\n(102:8-12), Also, she feels that because Morris' arrest \"with drugs that co~o that\" on\r\n\r\nhis person proves her darkest fears, (103:8-11). It worries her that she ~@t know if she\r\n\r\nwas raped, (104:10-11). Once again, opposing counsel asked          M~wart if she was\r\n                                                                    0~\r\nsexually harassed and she agreed, (55:20-25; 93:5-12; 116:13-2~:5-15); however, she\r\n                                                                o<i@\r\nis not qualified to make that purely legal determination.    I~d, she conceded that she\r\n                                                     ~\r\ndoesn't even understand what the specific legal goals>~er suit are, (149:18- 150:7);\r\n\r\n                                                    J\r\ntherefore, she is not qualified to discuss its legal ~ s. She can only speak to the facts\r\n\r\nshe knows. Moreover, it is unfortunate in the~eme that while she is plagued by the\r\n\r\nhaunting fear that she was raped while in~e and totally vulnerable through no fault\r\n\r\nof her own, Defendants' only focus i~ dismiss the matter as a routine matter of\r\nworkplace misconduct which sho~~ disposed of on irrelevant technicalities,\r\n\r\n      Mter she returned to~ston, from the Boston trip, Morris criticized her\r\n\r\n                         a~t.e didn't tell him she was offended by his conduct because\r\nperformance, (125:7-22); ~Ml\r\n\r\n\"she felt the time to ~o was with a lawyer in a courtroom\", (129:3-22). While the\r\n                       ~·\r\ncompany had a h~ resources department, she felt it would have been futile to talk to\r\n\r\nit because it   w~aded by Allen, Morris' son, (129:23- 130:17); and, she never received\r\nthe comp~~exual harassment policy, (130:18- 131:9). However, when Morris fired her\r\n\r\nin April, only six weeks after she began, she bluntly asked him if it was because she\r\n\r\ndeclined the massage proposition and he cut her off, saying, \"We're not going there.\"\r\n\r\n(131:25- 132:19). In regard to her overall testimony, it should be noted that there are\r\n\r\ndisturbing consistencies in the facts alleged by all three of the Plaintiffs; each was isolated\r\n\r\n                                              27\r\n\fon a trip with Morris shortly after beginning work at Edible; drinking was a prominent\r\n\r\nfeature of every trip; Morris encouraged the drinking and brought drinks he made to each\r\n\r\nwoman; each suffered blackouts and memmy loss; each alleges physical offensive contact;\r\n\r\neach was primed with virtually identical soothing assurances; each was made to feel ve1y\r\n\r\nuncomfortable; and, each fears she was raped while unconscious.            An~~ this was at\r\nthe hands of the company president and CEO, many years theikYor and married.\r\n\r\nIndividually and in toto, they clearly state viable prima fa~saultjbattery claims\r\n\r\nagainst the Defendants, which have nothing                 what~o           do with workplace\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.                                                o,jjff\r\n         In addition to the facts presented in the     d~ depositions of the three Assault\r\nVictims, additional depositions have been,             ~rein    obtained as well. Interestingly,\r\n                                                   ~\r\nDefendants made no mention whateve1· ~m in their previously denied Motion for\r\n\r\nSumma1y Judgment and they            persis~ that glaring        omission in their instant Plea.\r\n\r\nHowever, their testimony is velyore.ant to the Court's instant analysis, so they too are\r\n\r\nsuccinctly summarized.

Indeed, she felt he was\r\n\r\n\"constantly    it&~ropriate\", (24:3-5). She worked at Edible for three months, (24:14-15);\r\n(May,    ~~ugust, 2011, (68:23- 69:2)), and, in fact she complained to Morris' sons,\r\nTrevor and Allen and she was told, \"That's just the way he is.

She told the FBI she saw Morris pour something in Beth\r\n\r\nJackson's drink in Chicago and she decided that, \"Oh my gosh, something's gone terribly\r\n\r\nwrong.\" She felt that pouring something into a woman's drink without her knowledge was\r\n\r\ndeeply immoral, (29:8-20). They were in Chicago for a convention, including Morris, his\r\n                                                                          ~\r\nson Trevor, Beth Jackson and herself, (32:3-14). At the end of one day~§ gathered for\r\n\r\ndrinks, (32:22-25). Morris had been drinking liquor out of a   Peps~Ye during the day\r\n                                                                  o0\r\nand was quite drunk, (35:16- 36:2). They ordered drinks and wl~hey came to the table,\r\n\r\nMorris made a big deal of yelling for them to all look out   ~~ndow; while they did so,\r\nhe poured something in Beth's drink, (37:5- 38:10). Sll~rted to question him about it\r\n\r\nbecause she was alarmed, and he said, \"Shh, it's   fi~kay, don't say anything.\" (38: 11-\r\n\r\n                                          u\r\n17). Then, Beth mentioned that the dink tastOOcstronger and she stopped drinking it,\r\n                                              ~d\r\n(38:18-21).\r\n       At the time, she thought he mig~ve just added alcohol to Beth's drink, (43:23-\r\n\r\n44:1); but, later she decided it w~8ug. This was based upon seeing Beth with Morris\r\n\r\n                        ~or she could barely hold herself up and another time\r\nin Washington, D.C. in such\r\n\r\nin Houston when Beth w~~th him and appeared ve1y ill, grayish-green and looking\r\n                         (1_)~\r\nterrible, (44:2- 45:2o)~'§he said Morris' encouragement of excessive drinldng by others\r\n                     ~\r\nseemed very su;f$Ws, (47:11-19).

They met for drinks in the\r\n\r\nconcier~ge of their hotel. Shortly after that, they went out to walk on Bourbon Street\r\nand the woman appeared so drunk she could barely walk, which made her very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable. They went to Pat O'Brien's and Morris left her there, saying he was going\r\n\r\nto find the woman a cab, (53:13- 55:15); but, he was gone for over an hour and he had\r\n\r\nbeen inappropriately touching her, so she believed he took her back to his hotel room for\r\n\r\n                                            29\r\n\fillicit purposes, (59:3-18). This suspicion was enhanced when later he told her he had\r\n\r\ntaken the woman back to the hotel, which made no sense because she wasn't staying there,\r\n\r\n(61:16-22). Also, when they got back together, Morris' clothes were disheveled, he was\r\n\r\nvery sweaty and his hair was amuck, and he was over-excited and almost disoriented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlater, the woman apologized profusely for being so drunk, adding\r\n                                                                          *\r\nabout where they had been, (63:1-10).

Morris   h~~ntal car he used to pick her up, (77:18-21).\r\nThis was on a Sunday evening, C7T25~8:3); and, they drove to the hotel, (78:2-4), (a\r\n                                    .

Then, she heard the click of a phone camera and she looked and\r\n\r\nrealized she was naked and Morris was standing over her, (81:23- 82:4). She was so tired\r\n\r\nshe had trouble adjusting to what was going on and she muttered, \"Wait, I'm not ... like\r\n\r\nwhat is going on?\" Then, she sat up and asked Morris if he had just taken a nude picture\r\n                                              30\r\n\fof her, (82:5-11); which he hastily denied, (82:12). She became upset and asked him what\r\n\r\nhe was doing there, and she told him to leave and to give her the picture she knew he had\r\n\r\ntaken, (82:12-15). She was disoriented and confused, but she told him he could not have\r\n\r\nthe picture, but he just said it was fine, (82:19-23). Then, Morris left the r * and came\r\n\r\nright back in to show her his Blackbeny, v.ith no picture in it. She tr~~ index it, but\r\n\r\ncan't, (83:8-17). Then, he left again and she went back to sleep for   f~Qours,\r\n                                                                         (84:6-9).\r\n                                                                   0~\r\n        Morris denied it, but, she was certain he took nude pi~s of her in her hotel\r\n                                                                olf@\r\nroom, (97:15-20). And, of course this was confirmed after~is was arrested and they\r\n\r\nfound several nude photos of her in a locked flash   drive~ office, (101:1-13). She clearly\r\n                                                        ,§:;'\r\nremembers him in her room and herself naked i~ (98:1-5). He left her room about\r\n\r\n4:00am and she then slept until about 8:oo ~(99:4-11). More importantly, she also\r\n\r\nfeels certain she was raped because she    ~edness and bruises on her arm and \"hip\r\narea\". (99:12-22), She also felt like she ~een touched\" and she was sore in her \"female\r\n\r\nregions\", especially on the inside~~1-10).\r\n\r\n       Ms. Farmer took one ~rip with Morris. On that trip, once again, Morris had\r\nher meet him in the conciel!~Unge oftheir hotel, (116:9-10). He asked her if she wanted\r\n                           ©!~\r\na drink and she aske~\r\n                    ~chardonnay. But, after he brought it to her, it tasted disgusting,\r\nlike strong medic~~th a very bitter alkaline taste, (116:18-25). She said the taste was\r\n\r\ndefinitely not#mal taste, (118:3-25). She tried a few sips and then said she couldn't\r\n\r\ndrink it,   ~~6-18). They went to dinner; and, afterwards, Morris pressured her to have\r\nanother drink, but this time she mfused, (121:1-6). After they returned to Houston, she\r\n\r\nshortly learned that Morris refused to talk to her anymore, for a pretextual reason,\r\n\r\n(124:14-25). And, he remained distant and standoffish to her, (125:6-10).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             31\r\n\f       Later, she could vaguely remember being at dinner and that a comedian was there\r\n\r\nwhose picture Morris kept taking, (84:13-22). She has no idea where they were or what\r\n\r\nshe had for dinner, or any other details, (86: 9-13). She remembered going through a\r\n\r\ntunnel on the way to dinner, but little else, (89:6-13). That evening, she and Morris had\r\n\r\nmet in the hotel concierge lounge and had drinks, (89:14-18). She    dri~e and asked\r\nfor a glass of it, but Morris insisted she have a mixed drink,   (89:1~Q. She insisted on\r\n                                                                   o(\\j\r\nwine and he poured her a glass, but, then he told her they sho~t another drink to-go\r\n\r\nand go to runner in Manhattan and he insisted she have a   ~~drink, and he fixed her a\r\ndrink in a to-go cup, (90:17-25). However, the drink w~ strong she couldn't drink it,\r\n\r\nand she told him that. He then added some   soda~£ insisted that she drink it, (91:1-\r\n22). Shortly, she began to feel very dizzy, (92ffi10). In the elevator, Morris began to\r\n                                              ~C'\r\nmassage her neck and back, which she t~t was weird, (93:4-16); she told him that\r\n\r\nwas not necessary as it was making he~comfortable, and he stopped. But, later he put\r\n\r\nhis hands on her shoulders   an~~~Jih:16-25). By the time they arrived in Manhattan,\r\nshe was Clisoriented, (92:11-16d, Morris began holding her hand which made her feel\r\n\r\nvery uncomfortable, (93 :1~\r\n                      efJJ\r\n      This next morn~; incredibly, Morris was at the door of her hotel room asking why\r\n                  ~\r\nshe wasn't ready ~~e the client! (102:7- 103:8). She met him downstairs and it was she\r\n\r\nwho was   apo~ng for being unprofessional, (103:11-15); she blamed herselffor losing\r\ncontrol! ~22- 104:3). This is a creepy aspect of evmy one of Morris' victims: what\r\n\r\nhappened to them is so outlandish and bizarre; it is always they who take responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd, that is one of the most heartrending aspects of this case. Morris has already\r\n\r\nconfessed to federal felonies; but, even now he refuses to take any moral or civil legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility whatever for these heinous attacks. She emphatically denied giving Morris\r\n\r\n                                             32\r\n\fconsent to take nude pictures of her, (104:4-24). In response, Morris dismissed her\r\n\r\nconcern by saying it \"was no big deal\", (106:11-15). She felt terrible that day and continued\r\n\r\nto feel disoriented, (107:1-7), They went to dinner in Connecticut that night, but there\r\n\r\nwere no problems, (108:2- 110:8). On the final night of the trip, Morris *tioned the\r\n\r\nnight of her attack by saying he \"didn't want her to feel    uncomfortabl~use they had\r\ndone nothing wrong.\" (111:24- 112:3); he added that he felt a      consi~<;Jle \"attraction\" to\r\n                                                                       0~\r\nher, and that he wanted her to stay with the company for a~ time, (112:4-9). She\r\n                                                                  o0\r\nreplied that even if she had consented to what had happ~it was wrong because he\r\n\r\nwas married, (112:10-15); but, he said he had \"never     do~ything like this before and he\r\nreally liked her.\" (113:4-7). Then, he claimed he    h~ marriage, (113:10-12). She told\r\nhim their relationship had to be professional; ~~e told her he would hug her whenever\r\n\r\nhe felt like it, (113:13- 114:1). She   sta1ted~ng fOl' another job immediately, (114:18-\r\n20).                                       ~-\r\n       Erin Bjork testified9    that~orked for Edible from November, 2011, to mid-\r\nFebruary, 2012, (7:3-13). She r@ent!yinteracted with Defendant Morris, (14:14-16). He\r\n\r\nmade her feel very tmcom~le, (15:2-5); for instance, one day he came into her office,\r\n                        ,prpJ\r\nshut the door and beg~scussing her bathroom habits, (15:9-11; 15:16-21). On a day\r\n                    ~ wanted a sandwich in her room or whether she wanted to \"go out\r\ntrip, he asked her ~e\r\n\r\nbecause they #on the road\", whicll she thought was very weird, (17:1-6). Morris asked\r\n\r\nher to tr~~th him, but she firmly declined, (18:20-19:13). He did not come onto her,\r\n\r\nbut, she received a detailed complaint that he had from Michelle Barnett, which shocked\r\n\r\nher and made her sad, (20:12- 22:17). She was certain that the complaint was true, (23:10-\r\n\r\n\r\n9Deposition transcript of Bjork is attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\".

She told her husband the story and he advised her to leave the company and she told\r\n\r\nher mother, who was equally shocked, (24:20- 25:8). She felt Ms. Barnett should report\r\n\r\nthe matter, because she had been violated and she believed her, but it wasn't her call,\r\n\r\n(25:9- 26:1).\r\n\r\n         Then, later, Keri Hill came back from a trip with Morris,        loold~ted and all\r\nout of sorts\". At first, she denied any problems, but then said she ~roubled because\r\n\r\non the trip she blacked out and had no memory, (30:19- 31:14t~ had a rape kit d~ne\r\n                                                         0 '!@~\r\n\r\nand said her husband told her she had been drugged, (3~~ 32:5); and, she was very\r\n\r\ndistraught, (32:17-19). This second story about         Morri~~ply disturbed her, (32:9-10);\r\nbecause the two stories were so similar,        (34:4-8~ that, she refused to travel with\r\nMorris, and she was let go by him, (35:6-16;        3~~16).\r\n\r\n          Further, Samantha Gluck testified(f'her discovery deposition, in relevant part,\r\n\r\nthat Defendant Morris assaulted her b~~hing her and trying to get her to do things she\r\n\r\ndidn't want to do and she report~* to the FBI, (29:2-10). Very interestingly, opposing\r\n\r\ncounsel asked most of the 11'.it~s about sexual harassment, which is a manifestly legal\r\n\r\nterm; yet, when Ms. Glue!~~ she had been assaulted, he questioned her at length about\r\n\r\nthe fact that she had     ~al\r\n                         training to allow her to define that term, (29:11- 30:1). She\r\n                    ~\r\ncountered that s~~ant that Morris had tried to kiss hel' and had toucl!ed her breasts,\r\n\r\nrubbed his h #up and down her sides and grabbed her, \"on her breasts, evmywhere\",\r\n\r\n(30:2-8~lso tried to get her to both drink alcohol and to drink more of it than she\r\nwanted, (30:13-16). All of these things happened on out-of-town trips, (30:17-20).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10   Deposition transcript of Gluck is attached hereto as Exhibit \"F\".

She was very shocked and\r\n\r\npushed him away and said no; but, he was very persistent and kept grabbing her. She told\r\n\r\nhim to stop, but, he just kept at it. Finally, he stopped and she         ~lro her room\r\ndevastated, (66:11- 67:25). She called her husband, crying and up~~9:5-13); and, he\r\n\r\ntoo became upset, (69:13-14). He said he \"wanted to kill the b~\", (76:2-17). But, the\r\n\r\nnext day, she did not talk to Morris about the matter   becau~was afraid, (80:25- 81:6).\r\nHowever, she was adamant that he attacked her and sh~'t initiate the contact, (81:18-\r\n\r\n82:2). Morris was quiet all day, (82:8-17).         Q~\r\n        Then, there was a second trip to Phila:fl~hia, (89:12-14). And, the first incident\r\n\r\nwas essentially repeated: Monis       invitee(~to his room after dinner and when she\r\narrived, he had his shirt off and   starte~ on her again, (95:19-23).

EvenQ he l<ept telling her, drink up, drink up, no matter how\r\n\r\nbadly it tasted,   (97:17-1~\"'1a, he continued to pressure her about it, which she found\r\nvery odd,   (99:9-10)~oon as she got to his room, he tried to get to sit on the bed and\r\nhe began aggr~~ kissing her and touching her all over. She repeatedly told him no;\r\n\r\nbut, he said   ~dy would know. Finally, she bolted out of the room, (107:4-18).

She stated that initially,\r\n\r\nshe had a business relationship with Morris, (32:10-12); but, she later conceded that even\r\n\r\nthough she knows he is married to Ruth, whom she has met, (35:3-10), she has travelled\r\n\r\nwith him at least once a month since 2009, (37:4-11), and she        h~~ng-running\r\n\"personal relationship\" with him since about 2005, (49:4-22), lasili\"to 2011, (51:21-\r\n                                                                  0~\r\n52:4); which specifically included a sexuall·elationship with h~~9:20- 50:4). During\r\n\r\nthis time, both of them were married to other people,   event~ their respective spouses\r\ndid not lmow of their illicit relationship, (50:5-20).   ~relationship included sexual\r\nintercourse, (50:1-4), digital penetration,   (53:6-~allowing him to photograph her\r\nnude, (53:21-23), on numerous occasions anl~Jilumerous locations, (53:24- 54:5). He\r\n\r\ntook these nude photos with his cell pho~ich he would then save by downloading\r\n\r\nthem onto hard drives or flash drives, (~-8); her only restriction being that in the fully\r\n\r\nnude photos, her face not be shpfb4:16- 55:2). She said she intended Morris to use\r\n\r\nthe photos to arouse himself ~~is wife because while she easily aroused him, his Vl>ife\r\n\r\ndid not, (54:9- 56:2;   57:~:5; 58:25- 59:19; 60:5-19). The FBI now has the photos,\r\n(61:1-7). She also   con~q that Morris confided to her that he also took nude photos of\r\n                      ~\"\r\nAndrea Farmer, (~~19).              .\r\n       She   sa~orris often travels with small \"airplane\" bottles, (63:8-10); which she\r\nassume~~ed to \"re-cycle\" liquor, (63:24- 64:4); and, she has seen Morris often make\r\ndrinks for others, (68:12-14), including the use of \"to-go\" cups, (69:1-3). Therefore,\r\n\r\nthough she disagrees with Andrea Farmer's testimony \"too%\", (67:14-16); and also 100%,\r\n\r\n(83:12-13), ·with that of Keri Hill, (76:22- 80:15), and even v.>ith that of Stacy Stewart,\r\n\r\n (85:17- 88:3), Samantha Gluclc, (88:8-25) and, even Ms. Farmer's allegations about the\r\n\r\n                                               37\r\n\fAunt Sally's comptroller, (91:20- 93:2); such multiple disagreement must be filtered\r\n\r\nthrough her obvious bias in favor of her longtime lover, (107:20- 108:8), Defendant\r\n\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n       On the basis of this mass of testimony, it was clear to the Court in its denial of\r\n\r\nDefendants previously filed MSJ and its should continue to be clear in   t~nt analysis\r\n                                                              Am~~ Petition claims,\r\nof Defendants' equally flawed Plea that, as set out in their Third\r\n\r\nwhat Morris did to the Assault Victims is morally and legally ~~trous. Morris didn't\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against the Assault Victims, whether in or    o~e workplace; rather, he\r\nphysically attacked and sexually violated them!     Mor~~ expressly confessed that he\r\ninvited or induced the deferential and trusting    ~$victims across state lines; where\r\nin remote cities he mendaciously       drugged~         and all of them into intentional\r\n\r\ninsensibility, with the explicit intent offor~y removing their clothing, photographing\r\n\r\nthem naked and sexually     assaultin~em while they were completely inert and\r\nvulnerable. He treated each of ~.J;?fJas slabs of meat, to be abused while completely\r\n\r\ninsensate and defenseless, fm~sole purpose of gratifying his perverse, deviant sexual\r\n\r\nappetites. And, because hi\"~n-practiced drugging technique was ve1y effective, he now\r\n                         ~~\r\ncomes to this Court ~ng that the claims of the Assault Victims be trivialized and\r\n                     ~~\r\ndisposed of nude~ rubric of the TCHRA, which was intended by the Legislature to\r\n\r\nprovide an or# mechanism to deal with workplace discrimination and most certainly\r\n\r\nnever in~d as a procedural means to protect deviant sexual predators. In seeking such\r\n\r\na result, the Defendants brazenly ask for perfect immunity from personal, moral and legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility for Morris' overtly criminal and intentionally tortious acts. What an\r\n\r\nastonishing extremis to twist a \"Human Rights Act\" into!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              38\r\n\f         Both the previously denied MSJ and the instant Plea are factually predicated upon\r\n\r\nthe Assault Victims' physical inability to remember all of the details of their victimization.\r\n\r\nBut, such chemically induced diminished memory does not erase either the occurrence or\r\n\r\nmagnitude of their violation; it only emphasizes just how appallingly awfully they were\r\n\r\ntreated. Defendants' persistent pursuit of summary and/ or           proced~\"~ief on this\r\ndismissive basis defies logic and common sense and is fatally defec~~r four important\r\n\r\n                                                          nea~~entical, even though\r\nreasons. First, the stories of all of the Assault Victims are\r\n\r\nthey were separate in time, place and victim; which very ~~cingly establish Morris'\r\n\r\nmodus opemndi, as well as his malevolent, confessed ~~anal conduct. Second, these\r\nallegations are further confirmed by the     depositi~rin McMullan, Andrea Farmer,\r\nand Samantha Gluck, the latter two being ad~~al assault victims who do not happen\r\n\r\nto be plaintiffs in this case. So, thus f~y five victims corroborate Morris' vile\r\n\r\nconduct.' 2 Third, no less than a grand j~f the United States of America considered the\r\n\r\nfractured memories of the thoro~~raumatized Assault Victims and came to the polar\r\n\r\nopposite perception of  such~ch Defendants now urge upon this Court; finding\r\nsufficient cause to indict~ on multiple federal felony charges which precisely mirror\r\n\r\nthe actual claims   eac~~ntiff makes. And, fifth, Morris has already pled guilty to this\r\n                    ~\r\nentire disgusting ~~rio!\r\n\r\n    b.   PlaintL~ssert\r\n             g\"'l'     valid assault claims against Morris under Texas law.\r\n\r\n         T~~ should be clear that not one single Plaintiff asserted any claim whatsoever\r\nwhich is based upon or arises out of sexual harassment in tllEi worl<place; and, Defendants'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12 Still other victims have rendered statements to the FBI; but, as they have not been deposed in\r\n\r\ndiscovery herein, there stories are not herein discussed. However, they are out there as further\r\ncorroboration of Morris' heinous conduct.\r\n                                                39\r\n\fpersistent contentions that their claims are all so intertwined with sexual harassment in\r\n\r\nthe workplace as to be controlled by the TCHRA and Waffle House is a distortion of the\r\n\r\nfacts and claims herein and a misstatement of that law. It is true that each Plaintiff was\r\n\r\nenticed, directed or induced to travel with Morris on a \"business trip\". But, his intentional\r\n\r\ndrugging of each Assault Victim had nothing to do with work or job     du~~atsoever. If\r\nMorris had travelled to each of the stated cities on business; and, w~~ere he had gone\r\n\r\nout into the night and knoeked some stranger on the head        a~ile that person was\r\nunconscious he sexually assaulted him or her, it would be   ~ous to allege that he did\r\nso as a part of his business. The exact same logic    app~o the instant claims. Morris\r\nwholly deviated from any arguable job purpose      ~e elected to drug and violate his\r\nvictims for his corifessed personal,   sociopath~~ual    gratification; and, for Defendants\r\n\r\nto persist in arguing that he should be abl~o so with impunity, hiding behind a Texas\r\n\r\n                                 jo~ace discrimination, is completely unavailing.\r\nstatute designed solely to address\r\n\r\nAlternatively, even if Morris w~~ehow in the course and scope of his employment\r\n\r\nwhen he committed the ass~ they were assaults, not acts of discrimination; and\r\n\r\nWaffle House explicitly ~~erved \"an assault-based negligence claim arising from\r\n                     ~~\r\nindependent facts u~ed to sexual harassment.\" 313 S.W.3rd at 799· And, as discussed\r\n\r\ninfra, under ven~4!Jle Texas Supreme Court authority, both Defendants remain fully\r\nliable for   bo~al and exemplaty damages for the damages proximately caused to each\r\nand all ~~Plaintiffs.\r\n       Moreover, Defendants' contention that the TCHRA and Waffle House control this\r\n\r\nanalysis is fundamentally misplaced for a second important reason. If Texas substantive\r\n\r\nlaw does control these actions, there is a considerable body of such which supports the\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs' assaultjbattery claims, expressly preserved to them by Wqffle House, at 799.\r\n\r\n                                              40\r\n\f       In In 1'e VarTec Telecom, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936928\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936928/in-re-vartec-telecom-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (Bankr.

Both\r\nparties appealed that decision, arguing that:   \"the~approach is the most significant .\r\nrelationship methodology of the Restatement~ond) of Conflict of Laws, which w[as]\r\n\r\nadopted in Gutierrez v.
