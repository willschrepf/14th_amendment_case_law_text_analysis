Barner, a federal prisoner who was formerly incarcerated at the Federal\n\nCorrectional Institution in Allenwood, Pennsylvania (“FCI-Allenwood”), challenged his\n\nconfinement in administrative detention, the initiation of that confinement through a\n\ndetention order, and the disciplinary proceedings whereby he was sanctioned with a loss\n\nof 13 days good time credit, a 15-day term in disciplinary segregation, and a loss of\n\ncommissary and visitation privileges for six months. For the reasons that follow, we will\n\naffirm the order of the district court.\n\n       Barner was placed in the prison’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) in May 2003\n\npending investigation into an unrelated disciplinary infraction. On July 18, 2003, another\n\nSHU resident overdosed on medication, and correctional officials opened an investigation\n\ninto that matter. As part of that investigation, officials searched that inmate’s cell and\n\nretrieved several notes indicating that other SHU inmates had provided the pills.\n\nCorrections officials questioned Barner as well as several other inmates concerning their\n\npossible involvement and seized some of Barner’s personal property, including a\n\nprescription bottle. Barner began serving a disciplinary segregation sentence on an\n\nunrelated charge on August 7, and then, on August 20, officials issued a detention order\n\nto Barner notifying him that he would remain on administrative detention status pending\n\nthe investigation of the July 18 incident. On November 13, 2003, the investigation into\n\nthe overdose incident was closed and officials issued a misconduct report to Barner\n\ncharging him with misusing authorized medication in connection with the overdose. A\n\nhearing was held on November 20, 2003, before a disciplinary hearing officer (“DHO”).\n\fBarner declined representation and did not call any witnesses on his behalf. The DHO\n\nfound Barner guilty of the charge and imposed a sanction of a 13-day loss of good time\n\ncredit, as well as other penalties.\n\n       Barner filed a habeas petition in June 2005, alleging several due process\n\nviolations. He argued that (1) corrections officials did not serve him with a timely\n\nadministrative detention order, (2) his extended stay in the SHU for 115 days exceeded\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”) regulations and was not authorized by the warden\n\nas required under BOP’s policy, (3) the November 2003 disciplinary report was untimely\n\nissued, and (4) the disciplinary proceedings which resulted in his loss of good time credits\n\ndid not comport with due process requirements. The district court found that several of\n\nBarner’s claims were not capable of review under habeas corpus because they did not\n\ndeal with the fact or duration of his sentence. The court further concluded that\n\ncorrections officials’ actions throughout in his disciplinary proceedings, including the\n\ninitial filing of the disciplinary report, met due process requirements under Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974). Barner filed a timely notice of appeal.1\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). Our review of\n\nthe district court’s denial of a habeas petition is plenary. See Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     Barner filed his notice of appeal on the same day that he filed a motion under Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 60(b) in the district court. That motion has now been denied\nand is the subject of a separate appeal. See Barner v. Williamson, C.A. No. 07-1447.\n\f121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).2 Using this standard of review, we will affirm the district court’s\n\norder.\n\n         Regarding Barner’s claims that concern the loss of good time credits, we have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and agree with the district court that they are without merit.\n\nBarner was entitled to certain procedural protections for his loss of good time credit: (1)\n\nan impartial decision-making body; (2) twenty-four hour advance written notice of the\n\ncharges; (3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (4)\n\nassistance from a representative; and (5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied\n\nupon. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67. In addition, the decision must have support, but only\n\nby “some” evidence in the record. Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985).\n\nBarner does not strenuously contend that he was not afforded the protections under\n\nWolff; rather, the crux of Barner’s complaint is that the DHO’s decision was not\n\nsupported by “some” evidence. We do not agree.\n\n         In his report,3 the DHO noted that he relied upon several different types of\n\n\n   2\n   We also agree that Barner has properly exhausted his administrative remedies. See\nMoscato v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).\n   3\n     Barner makes much of the fact that, in response to Freedom of Information Act\nrequests, he received two different copies of the DHO’s report, one of which notes the\ninclusion of an investigating officer’s memorandum while the other does not. On appeal,\nBarner vigorously opposes the district court’s reliance on the version of the DHO report\nthat the warden maintained was the “final” report. But the information from the\ninvestigating officer’s memorandum had apparently already been made a part of the\nrecord, so the substance of that evidence–that Barner had admitted writing a note to the\noverdosed inmate and that he admitted providing the medication–was already contained\nin the DHO’s “draft” report. The differences between the two versions are negligible.\nPractically speaking, using either version of the report, there is ample evidence to support\n\fevidence: the statements by an investigating officer contained in the incident report,\n\nstatements in a memorandum from an intelligence officer, and Barner’s own admission\n\nwhen questioned by the DHO at the hearing. Specifically, both of the investigating\n\nofficials reported that Barner had written a note to the overdosed inmate recovered from\n\nthe overdosed inmate’s cell in which he stated: “Chucky, . . . these are Teretol, they are\n\nlike Elavil only not quite as strong.” Barner had a prescription for Teretol. Barner\n\nadmitted that he wrote the note when questioned by one of the officials. Furthermore, the\n\nDHO report reflects that Barner admitted the charge when he was questioned at the\n\nhearing, and that he elaborated by saying that he gave the other inmate his medication.4\n\nWe find that this certainly provides “some” evidence to support the DHO’s finding and\n\nmeets the criteria of Hill.\n\n       Finally, Barner contends that the November disciplinary report was untimely\n\nissued under BOP regulations. That provision provides: “Staff shall give each inmate\n\ncharged with violating a Bureau rule a written copy of the charge(s) against the inmate,\n\nordinarily within 24 hours of the time staff became aware of the inmate’s involvement in\n\nthe incident.” 28 C.F.R. § 541.15(a). In this instance, prison officials confiscated items\n\nfrom Barner’s cell and questioned him on July 19, a day after the overdose incident.\n\nHowever, officials did not issue the charge against Barner until November 13, 2003,\n\n\n\n\nthe DHO’s finding. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.\n   4\n     Barner now contends that he never made such an admission to the investigating\nofficer or the DHO.\n\fwhich was six hours after the investigation into the overdose closed.\n\n       Certainly, Barner cannot claim that officials violated the procedures required by\n\nWolff, i.e., that an inmate receive written notice of the charge(s) 24 hours before a\n\nhearing, because Barner clearly had adequate and proper notice before the hearing.\n\nRather, Barner contends that a violation of 28 C.F.R. § 541.15(a) constituted a\n\ndeprivation of due process.5 In making this claim, Barner assumes that once he was\n\ninterviewed and his property was confiscated, the investigation should have concluded,\n\nbut he ignores the fact that other inmates were also suspects in the investigation. We\n\nagree with the district court’s conclusion that no actionable due process claim occurred as\n\nthere was no unwarranted delay in issuing the charge within hours of the close of the\n\ninvestigation in November. 6\n\n\n   5\n     Notably, the regulation states that “ordinarily” the officials shall provide the inmate\nwith a charge within 24 hours of knowledge of his involvement. See 28 C.F.R. §\n541.15(a). Ordinarily, prison officials are given wide discretion to adopt and execute\ntheir policies needed to maintain internal order. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547\n(1979). Moreover, while Barnes would have a liberty interest in the good time credits,\nBarnes has not shown that the regulation specifying the time at which a person must be\nnotified of the charge either itself creates a liberty or property interest, or that its violation\nnecessarily abridges the constitutional protections established in Wolff. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Connor, 515 U.S. 472, 487 (1995).\n   6\n     We will not disturb the district court’s determination that Barner’s first and second\nclaims dealing with his administrative detention and the initiation of that detention were\nincapable of review under § 2241 as challenges to the “execution” of Barner’s sentence,\nor whether they should have been asserted in a § 1983 complaint. See Woodall v. Fed.\nBureau of Prisons, 432 F.3d 235, 242 n.5 (3d Cir. 2005). Barner has already filed a\nseparate civil rights complaint, which alleges in part that corrections officials untimely\nserved the detention order, and the district court has already issued an opinion on the\nmerits of the claims in that action. See Barner v. Williamson, M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 05-cv-\n001972 (Order, Mar. 27, 2007). Even if the claims were cognizable on habeas review, we\n\f      We will affirm the district court’s order denying Barner’s petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\nwould deny them because they lack merit. See Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 708 (3d\nCir. 1997) (continued detention in administrative custody did not deprive prisoner of\nliberty interest triggering federal procedural due process rights).\n\f",

No. 07-1447.\n\f121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).2 Using this standard of review, we will affirm the district court’s\n\norder.\n\n         Regarding Barner’s claims that concern the loss of good time credits, we have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and agree with the district court that they are without merit.\n\nBarner was entitled to certain procedural protections for his loss of good time credit: (1)\n\nan impartial decision-making body; (2) twenty-four hour advance written notice of the\n\ncharges; (3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (4)\n\nassistance from a representative; and (5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied\n\nupon. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67. In addition, the decision must have support, but only\n\nby “some” evidence in the record. Superintendent v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (1985).\n\nBarner does not strenuously contend that he was not afforded the protections under\n\nWolff; rather, the crux of Barner’s complaint is that the DHO’s decision was not\n\nsupported by “some” evidence. We do not agree.\n\n         In his report,3 the DHO noted that he relied upon several different types of\n\n\n   2\n   We also agree that Barner has properly exhausted his administrative remedies. See\nMoscato v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728093\"><a href=\"/opinion/728093/phillip-b-moscato-08126-050-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons-lsci/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).\n   3\n     Barner makes much of the fact that, in response to Freedom of Information Act\nrequests, he received two different copies of the DHO’s report, one of which notes the\ninclusion of an investigating officer’s memorandum while the other does not. On appeal,\nBarner vigorously opposes the district court’s reliance on the version of the DHO report\nthat the warden maintained was the “final” report. But the information from the\ninvestigating officer’s memorandum had apparently already been made a part of the\nrecord, so the substance of that evidence–that Barner had admitted writing a note to the\noverdosed inmate and that he admitted providing the medication–was already contained\nin the DHO’s “draft” report. The differences between the two versions are negligible.\nPractically speaking, using either version of the report, there is ample evidence to support\n\fevidence: the statements by an investigating officer contained in the incident report,\n\nstatements in a memorandum from an intelligence officer, and Barner’s own admission\n\nwhen questioned by the DHO at the hearing. Specifically, both of the investigating\n\nofficials reported that Barner had written a note to the overdosed inmate recovered from\n\nthe overdosed inmate’s cell in which he stated: “Chucky, . . . these are Teretol, they are\n\nlike Elavil only not quite as strong.” Barner had a prescription for Teretol. Barner\n\nadmitted that he wrote the note when questioned by one of the officials. Furthermore, the\n\nDHO report reflects that Barner admitted the charge when he was questioned at the\n\nhearing, and that he elaborated by saying that he gave the other inmate his medication.4\n\nWe find that this certainly provides “some” evidence to support the DHO’s finding and\n\nmeets the criteria of Hill.\n\n       Finally, Barner contends that the November disciplinary report was untimely\n\nissued under BOP regulations. That provision provides: “Staff shall give each inmate\n\ncharged with violating a Bureau rule a written copy of the charge(s) against the inmate,\n\nordinarily within 24 hours of the time staff became aware of the inmate’s involvement in\n\nthe incident.” 28 C.F.R. § 541.15(a). In this instance, prison officials confiscated items\n\nfrom Barner’s cell and questioned him on July 19, a day after the overdose incident.\n\nHowever, officials did not issue the charge against Barner until November 13, 2003,\n\n\n\n\nthe DHO’s finding. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.\n   4\n     Barner now contends that he never made such an admission to the investigating\nofficer or the DHO.\n\fwhich was six hours after the investigation into the overdose closed.\n\n       Certainly, Barner cannot claim that officials violated the procedures required by\n\nWolff, i.e., that an inmate receive written notice of the charge(s) 24 hours before a\n\nhearing, because Barner clearly had adequate and proper notice before the hearing.\n\nRather, Barner contends that a violation of 28 C.F.R. § 541.15(a) constituted a\n\ndeprivation of due process.5 In making this claim, Barner assumes that once he was\n\ninterviewed and his property was confiscated, the investigation should have concluded,\n\nbut he ignores the fact that other inmates were also suspects in the investigation. We\n\nagree with the district court’s conclusion that no actionable due process claim occurred as\n\nthere was no unwarranted delay in issuing the charge within hours of the close of the\n\ninvestigation in November. 6\n\n\n   5\n     Notably, the regulation states that “ordinarily” the officials shall provide the inmate\nwith a charge within 24 hours of knowledge of his involvement. See 28 C.F.R. §\n541.15(a). Ordinarily, prison officials are given wide discretion to adopt and execute\ntheir policies needed to maintain internal order. See Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547\n(1979). Moreover, while Barnes would have a liberty interest in the good time credits,\nBarnes has not shown that the regulation specifying the time at which a person must be\nnotified of the charge either itself creates a liberty or property interest, or that its violation\nnecessarily abridges the constitutional protections established in Wolff. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1995).\n   6\n     We will not disturb the district court’s determination that Barner’s first and second\nclaims dealing with his administrative detention and the initiation of that detention were\nincapable of review under § 2241 as challenges to the “execution” of Barner’s sentence,\nor whether they should have been asserted in a § 1983 complaint. See Woodall v. Fed.\nBureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 n.5 (3d Cir. 2005). Barner has already filed a\nseparate civil rights complaint, which alleges in part that corrections officials untimely\nserved the detention order, and the district court has already issued an opinion on the\nmerits of the claims in that action. See Barner v. Williamson, M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 05-cv-\n001972 (Order, Mar. 27, 2007). Even if the claims were cognizable on habeas review, we\n\f      We will affirm the district court’s order denying Barner’s petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\nwould deny them because they lack merit. See Griffin v. Vaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (3d\nCir. 1997) (continued detention in administrative custody did not deprive prisoner of\nliberty interest triggering federal procedural due process rights).\n\f</pre>",
