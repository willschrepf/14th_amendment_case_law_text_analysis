Art. 37.071, ยง 2(h).  After\r\nreviewing appellant's forty-seven points of error, we find them to be without merit. \r\nConsequently, we affirm the trial court's judgment and sentence of death.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>STATEMENT OF FACTS</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, but a brief statement of\r\nthe facts is helpful for an understanding of his claims.  Appellant was charged with\r\nintentionally and knowingly causing the deaths of Raekwon Agnew<sup> (3)</sup> and Harold Sublet, Jr.,\r\nby stabbing and cutting them with a knife, during the same criminal transaction.  The record\r\nshows that on September 15, 2007, appellant murdered his wife, Chare Agnew, and his 9-\r\nand 10-year-old stepsons, Harold and Raekwon, and he raped his 12- and 14-year-old\r\nstepdaughters, Garysha Brown and LaKenya Agnew.<sup> (4)</sup>  Some time after midnight, when\r\neveryone else in the house was asleep, appellant put his hand over Chare's mouth and\r\nstabbed her eighteen times as she lay in her bed.  He then went into the boys' bedroom.  As\r\nRaekwon lay sleeping, appellant woke Harold and took him to the kitchen, where he stabbed\r\nhim at least 45 times.  He then woke Raekwon, took him to the kitchen, and killed him in the\r\nsame manner.  Appellant dragged the boys' bodies to the living room and covered them with\r\na comforter.  He then went into the girls' bedroom and woke LaKenya.  He pulled her out\r\nof bed at gunpoint, tied her up with bedsheets, and told her he had killed her mother and\r\nbrothers.  He showed her their bodies and told her it was her fault they were dead.  Next, he\r\nwoke Garysha and tied her up with electrical cords, and he tied a washcloth around her\r\nmouth.  He then told LaKenya that in order to save her and her sister's life, one of the girls\r\nwould have to have sex with him.  LaKenya said that she would do it.  Appellant took her to\r\nthe living room and raped her on the living room couch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen he had finished raping LaKenya, appellant took Garysha to the living room and\r\nraped her on the couch, next to her sister.  Then, he made the girls stay in the bathroom with\r\nhim while he took a shower.  He apologized to the girls for the rapes and murders.  He told\r\nthem that their mother had been trying to poison him and that her death was their fault.  Next,\r\nhe forced both girls to go with him into the garage, where he tried, unsuccessfully, to change\r\nthe license plate on his car.  He took the girls back to the living room, where he lifted the\r\ncomforter and showed the girls their brothers' bodies.  He remarked that Raekwon was\r\nstronger than he had expected him to be.  Appellant made the girls walk into their mother's\r\nbedroom and kiss her face, and then he put them into the bedroom closet.  He started a CD\r\nplayer and told them that help would come when the music ended.  He then locked the closet\r\ndoor and moved a dresser in front of it.  Finally, appellant left the house.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant drove to his mother's house to borrow her car.  He then drove to the home\r\nof his former girlfriend, Shunta Alexander, and their teenaged daughter, Brianna.  He told\r\nShunta what he had done.  He gave her some money for Brianna and remarked that if there\r\nwas a reward for catching him, Brianna should have it.  Shunta begged him to call the police. \r\nAppellant called the police on his cell phone and briefly reported that he had killed his wife\r\nand two boys and he had left two girls locked in a bedroom closet.  He provided the address\r\nand stated that he knew the police would trace the call if he stayed on the phone too long. \r\nHe then hung up, broke his cell phone, and left Shunta's home.  Later that morning,\r\nappellant's cousin drove him to the Greyhound bus station, where he bought a bus ticket\r\nunder an assumed name and traveled to Austin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant returned to Dallas a few days later.  He called a police detective and asked\r\nhim if the police had found an audiocassette tape he had left in the house, which he believed\r\ncontained a recording of Chare or one of the children admitting that they had been conspiring\r\nagainst him.  He thought that this tape would help his case.<sup> (5)</sup>  After his arrest, appellant made\r\na statement to police in which he requested testing for the presence of poison in his body, and\r\nhe said that LaKenya and Garysha should be polygraphed about whether Chare had been\r\npoisoning him.  He provided buccal, blood, hair, and fingernail samples to be tested for\r\nevidence of poisoning, but the lab that received the samples was not able to conduct the\r\nrequested tests, and investigators were unable to locate a lab with that capability.<sup> (6)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A. \tJury Voir Dire</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error one through seventeen, appellant complains that the trial court erred\r\nby denying the defense's challenges for cause to seventeen potential jurors.  The record\r\nshows that appellant used a peremptory strike to exclude each of the challenged potential\r\njurors.  He exhausted all of his peremptory strikes and was granted two additional peremptory\r\nstrikes.  After the trial court denied his request for a third additional peremptory strike,\r\nappellant identified an objectionable juror whom he was forced to accept.  Therefore,\r\nappellant preserved error.<sup> (7)</sup>  However, because the trial court granted him two additional\r\nperemptory strikes, appellant must show that the trial court committed error in denying his\r\nchallenges for cause to three potential jurors to demonstrate that he was harmed. <sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe look at the entire record of voir dire to determine if there is sufficient evidence\r\nto support the court's ruling on a challenge for cause.<sup> (9)</sup>  We give great deference to the trial\r\njudge's  decision because he is present to observe the venireman's demeanor and to listen to\r\nhis tone of voice.<sup> (10)</sup>  Particular deference is due when the potential juror's answers are\r\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory.<sup> (11)</sup>   In addition, \"[w]hen the record is confused, and\r\nwithout a clearly objectionable declaration by the venireman, . . . we must defer to the trial\r\ncourt's understanding of what actually occurred.\"<sup> (12)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA potential juror is challengeable for cause if he has a bias or prejudice against the\r\ndefendant or against the law upon which either the State or the defense is entitled to rely.<sup> (13)</sup> \r\n The test is whether the prospective juror's bias or prejudice would substantially impair his\r\nability to carry out his oath and instructions in accordance with the law.<sup> (14)</sup>  Before a\r\nprospective juror may be excused for cause on this basis, the law must be explained to him,\r\nand he must be asked whether he can follow that law, regardless of his personal views.<sup> (15)</sup>  To\r\nestablish that the challenge for cause is proper, the proponent of the challenge must show that\r\nthe prospective juror understood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his\r\nprejudice well enough to follow the law.<sup> (16)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tProspective jurors are not challengeable for their particular views about specific \r\nevidence.<sup> (17)</sup>  The law does not require a juror to consider a specifically enumerated type of\r\nevidence as either mitigating or aggravating.<sup> (18)</sup>  Therefore, a trial court does not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in overruling a defendant's challenge for cause based on a prospective juror's\r\nopinion that a particular type of evidence is not <em>per se</em> mitigating.<sup> (19)</sup>  Indeed, a trial court does\r\nnot abuse its discretion by disallowing questioning concerning a prospective juror's views\r\nabout the mitigating value of particular evidence.<sup> (20)</sup>  What is constitutionally required is that\r\njurors must not be precluded or prohibited from considering any relevant evidence offered\r\nin mitigation of punishment.<sup> (21)</sup>  This requirement is satisfied so long as a defendant is allowed\r\nto present relevant mitigating evidence and the jury is provided a vehicle to give mitigating\r\neffect to that evidence, if the jury finds it to be mitigating.<sup> (22)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's first point of error concerns prospective juror Lawrence Allen.  The\r\nrecord shows that, at the beginning of voir dire, Allen indicated that he generally favored the\r\ndeath penalty as an appropriate punishment for an intentional murder.  However, when he\r\nwas asked if, after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder, he could presume at the\r\nbeginning of the punishment phase that the answer to the future dangerousness question\r\nshould be negative, he replied that he would \"have no problem with that.\"  When Allen was\r\nasked if, after answering the future dangerousness question affirmatively, he could keep an\r\nopen mind concerning the mitigation question, he again stated that he would \"have no\r\nproblems with that.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel asked Allen if he thought that poverty would be a mitigating\r\ncircumstance, and Allen replied, \"Probably not.\"  Counsel then asked Allen whether he\r\nwould consider a mental defect to be mitigating.  Allen answered, \"I think I'd have to\r\nconsider that.  Any answer I give, it depends upon the circumstances taking place at the time\r\nof the trial, I think.\"  At the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Allen for\r\ncause on the ground that he was an \"automatic death penalty juror,\" in that he would always\r\nanswer the future dangerousness issue affirmatively and would not consider any mitigating\r\nfactors, particularly poverty.  The trial judge denied the challenge for cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  Regardless of his personal views,\r\nAllen affirmed that he could follow the law once it had been explained to him.  Additionally,\r\nhis statement that he did not think that poverty would be a mitigating circumstance did not\r\nmake him challengeable for cause.  Point of error one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's second point of error concerns prospective juror Anthony Stephenson. \r\nThe record reflects that the prosecutor explained to Stephenson that, if the defendant were\r\nfound guilty and they moved to the punishment phase, the jurors would have to presume that\r\nthe answer to the future dangerousness question would be no.  Stephenson stated that he\r\ncould make that presumption.  He also stated that he could keep an open mind concerning\r\nmitigation.  Later, defense counsel asked Stephenson whether, after he found a defendant\r\nguilty of a heinous capital murder, he would think that the defendant was a future danger. \r\nStephenson responded, \"Generally speaking, yes.\"  Counsel then asked, \"In that situation,\r\nwhen it comes to Special Issue Number 1 you're gonna always answer that in the way that\r\nwould be yes, if you found someone guilty of capital murder, that they would be a future\r\ndanger[]; is that right?\"  Stephenson responded, \"I would say yes.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the end of voir dire, counsel challenged Stephenson for cause on the ground that\r\nhe would always answer Special Issue Number 1, the future dangerousness special issue,\r\naffirmatively.  The State asked that Stephenson be brought back for clarification on that\r\npoint.  The trial court then brought Stephenson back and questioned him:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court: \tWhen [the prosecutor] was asking you questions, you understand that\r\nafter you found a defendant guilty of a capital offense, then you\r\nproceed into the punishment phase of the trial, or punishment part of\r\nthe trial?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson: \tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court: \tYou find out more evidence, and in going into that you would have to\r\nassume that the correct verdict before you heard anything from the state\r\nwould be that a life sentence would be the appropriate sentence in the\r\ncase.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\t Right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAnd then the state has to overcome that presumption, like the\r\npresumption of innocence, by proving to you beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that there is a probability that the defendant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.  Or be a continuing threat to\r\nsociety.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\t Right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\t Kind of predicting the future, so to speak.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAnd what is your opinion? . . . After having found-if you find him\r\nguilty, then can you presume the appropriate sentence is a life sentence\r\nuntil the state-and have the state prove to you beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt of the future-dangerousness issue . . . before you would invoke\r\nthe death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOr would you always, having found a person guilty of a heinous crime\r\nsuch as a capital-murder case, that you would always find [S]pecial\r\n[I]ssue [1] yes, because if he killed two or more it was so heinous that\r\nyou would always think that person would be a continuing threat to\r\nsociety?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tNo, I would not always think that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOkay.  So you could make the state do their job, assume that a life\r\nsentence was an appropriate sentence, and then make the state prove to\r\nyou, if they can, the future-dangerousness issue?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOne other thing.  Are you telling me you would or would not\r\nautomatically find Special Issue Number 1, the answer to be yes?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYes is the one that invokes the death penalty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(Pause in proceedings)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tHave I confused you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tI have to say I would not always find yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tIn other words, you could follow the law and make them prove Special\r\nIssue Number 1 to you before you would make that finding of yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tChallenge for cause is denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYour honor, I have two things on the record.  I did forget about the\r\nmitigation.  He specifically indicated he would not consider poverty or\r\neducation as a mitigating factor.  We submit for cause on those, also.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tChallenge for cause is denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThis record shows that Stephenson arguably gave inconsistent answers concerning the\r\nfuture dangerousness question.  We afford particular deference to the trial court's\r\ndetermination that Stephenson was not challengeable for cause on this basis.  Further,\r\nStephenson was not challengeable for cause based on his statements that he did not think that\r\npoverty and education were mitigating.  Point of error two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fifth point of error concerns prospective juror William Triola.  The record\r\nreflects that, when the prosecutor explained the penalty phase and asked Triola whether, after\r\nfinding the defendant guilty, he could presume that the future dangerousness question should\r\nbe answered negatively, Triola affirmed that he could do so.  He stated that he would listen\r\nto all the evidence and keep an open mind before answering that question.  Concerning\r\nmitigation, Triola stated that he would consider how the defendant lived his life, and what\r\nthoughts or reasons might have driven him to commit the offense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel examined Triola about his written questionnaire.  In response to the\r\nquestion of whether some crimes, just because of their facts, called for the death penalty,\r\nTriola had written, \"Premeditated murder or murder[] of an innocent person in the\r\ncommission of a crime deserves the death penalty whether the [defendant] committed\r\nprevious acts or not.\"  When questioned about this response, Triola affirmed that that was\r\nhow he felt, and he stated that he believed that someone who committed a premeditated\r\nmurder \"pretty much\" deserved the death penalty.  However, he also explained that those\r\nwere his personal feelings, and he had not known about the applicable law and the penalty-\r\nphase questions until voir dire.  He stated that, until the prosecutor explained the penalty\r\nphase to him, he had believed that the jurors' job was done once they found a defendant\r\nguilty of premeditated or \"first degree\" murder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel asked Triola what he would want to know when he answered the\r\nspecial issues.  Triola said that he would want to know about the defendant's past to make\r\na decision concerning future dangerousness.  He stated that a defendant's history of violent\r\nbehavior for most of his adult life would indicate a probability that the defendant would\r\ncommit future acts of violence.  He also stated that he agreed with the presumption that a life\r\nsentence would be appropriate until the State proved future dangerousness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel explained that neither party had a burden of proof on the mitigation\r\nquestion.  He asked Triola what would be important to him in considering the mitigation\r\nspecial issue, and Triola answered that a sufficient mitigating circumstance could be \"almost\r\nanything.\"  He affirmed that he would keep an open mind and consider whatever evidence\r\nwas presented.  When counsel asked for examples, Triola answered, \"What might have\r\nhappened to the defendant in the past would be possibly mitigating circumstances.\"  Counsel\r\nasked him whether poverty or substance abuse would be mitigating circumstances.  Triola\r\nreplied that he did not think that they would be.  He believed that physical abuse and possibly\r\nmental-defect evidence could be mitigating, but he stated that he would have to hear the\r\nevidence before he could make a decision.  He stated that he would be open to testimony\r\nfrom a psychiatrist or psychologist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel then challenged Triola for cause on the ground that he was an\r\n\"automatic death penalty juror,\" who would always find future dangerousness and who stated\r\nthat someone who committed premeditated murder would deserve the death penalty\r\nregardless of any special issues on that point.  Counsel also challenged him as being\r\n\"mitigation-impaired\" because he did not consider poverty and substance abuse to be\r\nmitigating factors.  The prosecutor responded that Triola had stated that he would make the\r\npunishment decision based on the evidence and argument presented in the penalty phase, not\r\njust the facts of the offense, and that he had indicated he would listen to the evidence\r\npresented during each phase of the trial and give each step of the process due consideration. \r\nThe trial court denied the challenge for cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  Triola indicated that he could set aside\r\nhis personal feelings and follow the law concerning the special issues.  Triola's statements\r\nthat he did not think that poverty and substance abuse would be mitigating did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Point of error five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's sixth point of error concerns prospective juror Myrna Conde.  When\r\nquestioned by the State, Conde consistently affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty of\r\ncapital murder, she would keep an open mind and follow the law with respect to the future\r\ndangerousness and mitigation issues.  When questioned by defense counsel as to whether \r\nfinding the defendant guilty would cause her to favor the death penalty, she initially\r\nresponded, \"If it was presented that the defendant did commit the crime[,] that the severity\r\nof it was horrendous, the circumstances were premeditation, I believe that the State of Texas\r\ndoes impose the death penalty, I would be in favor of that.\"  She then indicated that she did\r\nnot mean to say that in such a case the State \"imposes\" the death penalty, but rather the State\r\nof Texas \"allows\" the death penalty.  Defense counsel asked Conde several times whether,\r\nafter finding the defendant guilty, she would presume that the defendant would be a future\r\ndanger, and each time Conde affirmed that she would answer the future dangerousness\r\nquestion affirmatively.  When counsel asked Conde if there was anything that she thought\r\nwould be mitigating or important to her, she stated that there was nothing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCounsel then challenged Conde for cause on the grounds that after having found\r\nsomeone guilty, she would always presume the defendant to be a future danger and she\r\nwould not consider anything to be mitigating.  The State responded that the way counsel had\r\nasked the questions had led Conde to give those answers.  The trial court then called Conde\r\nback for additional questioning.  The court again explained the phases of the trial and the law\r\napplicable to the punishment phase.  Conde indicated that, after finding the defendant guilty,\r\nshe would not presume that the future dangerousness question should be answered\r\naffirmatively, and she would keep an open mind and consider any mitigating circumstances. \r\nThe court then denied defense counsel's challenge for cause.  Counsel objected to the court's\r\nrehabilitation of Conde and re-urged his challenge for cause, which was again denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Conde vacillated depending on who was asking the questions. \r\nWhen the law was explained to her, she affirmed that she would follow the law.  In this\r\nsituation, we afford particular deference to the trial court's determination.<sup> (23)</sup>  Point of error\r\nsix is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's seventh point of error concerns prospective juror Peter Cavazos.  At the\r\nconclusion of voir dire, appellant challenged Cavazos on the ground that he would always\r\nanswer the mitigation special issue in a way that the death penalty would result because he\r\nwould not consider poverty or substance abuse to be mitigating factors.  Cavazos's\r\nstatements that particular types of evidence were not mitigating to him did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.<sup> (24)</sup>  Point of error seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's eighth point of error concerns prospective juror Patrick Norton.  Norton\r\nopined that, in general, the death penalty would be a just penalty for any murder.  However,\r\nwhen questioned by the prosecutor, he affirmed that he would keep an open mind and follow\r\nthe law concerning the future dangerousness and mitigation issues.  When defense counsel\r\nquestioned Norton about his written responses to the jury questionnaire, he stated that his\r\nown feelings were that if someone takes a life, his own life ought to be taken.  However,\r\nNorton affirmed that, after the law had been explained to him, he would follow the law and\r\nnot prejudge the case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNorton also stated that he would consider mitigating circumstances.  He\r\nacknowledged that he had written on his questionnaire that background was \"not an excuse\"\r\nin assessing punishment, but he affirmed that, after he was made aware of the context for that\r\nquestion, he could \"probably\" take into consideration anything that would \"be leading up to\r\nwhy [the defendant was] doing this crime.\"  When counsel asked Norton whether he would\r\nconsider poverty and education to be mitigating, Norton responded that they were not\r\nmitigating.  Counsel also asked Norton whether he would consider a mental defect to be\r\nmitigating.  Norton first stated that he was not sure, and then later he indicated that a mental\r\ndefect would not be sufficiently mitigating.  Defense counsel challenged Norton for cause\r\non the grounds that he would always answer the future dangerousness question affirmatively\r\nafter finding the defendant guilty, and he would not give any meaningful consideration to any\r\nmitigating factor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConcerning future dangerousness, the record shows that Norton stated that he could\r\nset aside his personal views and follow the law.  Concerning mitigation, Norton's statements\r\nthat particular types of evidence were not mitigating to him did not render him challengeable\r\nfor cause.<sup> (25)</sup>  Point of error eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's ninth point of error concerns prospective juror Harold Wheeler.  The\r\nrecord shows that, after the prosecutor explained the law concerning the special issues,\r\nWheeler indicated that he would keep an open mind and follow the law.  He said that he\r\nwould presume a negative answer to the future dangerousness question until the State proved\r\notherwise.  The prosecutor pointed out that Wheeler had given a written response on the jury\r\nquestionnaire, stating that mitigation is \"never an issue\" in a murder case.  However, after\r\nthe prosecutor explained the mitigation issue, Wheeler again confirmed that he would follow\r\nthe law and keep an open mind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the defense's examination, Wheeler was somewhat less sure of his ability to\r\nset the defendant's guilt aside when considering the future dangerousness issue, but he\r\ncontinued to maintain that he would not always answer the future dangerousness question\r\naffirmatively, and that he would keep an open mind.  Concerning the mitigation issue,\r\nWheeler reiterated that he had not understood the law when he filled out the jury\r\nquestionnaire, but he now understood the law and could consider mitigating evidence.  When\r\ncounsel questioned him about particular types of mitigating evidence, Wheeler stated that he\r\nwas willing to consider mental illness as a mitigating factor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of voir dire, counsel challenged Wheeler on the ground that he\r\nequivocated on the future dangerousness issue, was inclined to answer it affirmatively, and\r\nwould not presume a negative answer, which effectively lessened the State's burden to prove\r\nfuture dangerousness.  Counsel also challenged Wheeler on the ground that he would be\r\nunable to give fair consideration to mitigation, based on his written questionnaire answer that\r\nhe did not think mitigation was appropriate in a murder case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  After the law pertaining to the future\r\ndangerousness question had been explained to him, Wheeler indicated that he would set aside\r\nhis personal feelings and follow the law.  Although Wheeler wrote on his juror questionnaire\r\nthat mitigation was \"never an issue,\" after the law was explained to him, he affirmed that he\r\nwould follow the law and consider mitigating evidence.  Point of error nine is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's tenth point of error concerns prospective juror Stacy Chadwick.  The\r\nrecord reflects that at the beginning of voir dire, Chadwick indicated that she generally\r\nfavored the death penalty.  She stated that she did not have any problem with assessing the\r\ndeath penalty because, in her view, someone who made the decision to take the lives of\r\nothers \"brought [the death sentence] upon himself.\"  However, after the prosecutor explained\r\nthe penalty phase and the special issues to her, Chadwick indicated that she could presume\r\nthat the appropriate sentence would be life without parole until the State proved the\r\ndefendant's future dangerousness to her.  Concerning mitigation, she stated that she could\r\nkeep an open mind.  She indicated that drug use would not be \"an excuse\" for committing\r\nan offense.  She acknowledged that after finding a defendant guilty and also answering the\r\nfuture dangerousness issue affirmatively, she would have to see \"something massive\" to\r\ncause her to find sufficient mitigation in order to change the death sentence to life.  She\r\nagreed, however, to listen to the evidence and keep an open mind.  Her answers during the\r\ndefense's examination were consistent with these responses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Chadwick on several\r\ngrounds: she was death-prone and would \"equate finding of guilty with the result of death\";\r\nafter an hour and a half of explaining, she still did not \"seem to fully understand or appreciate\r\nthe mitigation scheme put in place by the legislature\"; and she would not properly consider\r\nthe mitigation question.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record does not support appellant's assertion that Chadwick would \"equate\"\r\nfinding guilt with a death sentence.  Chadwick initially said that someone who killed\r\nsomeone else had brought the death penalty upon himself, but after the law was explained\r\nto her, she affirmed that she would set aside her personal feelings and follow the law\r\nconcerning future dangerousness.  Nor does the record support appellant's assertions that\r\nChadwick did not understand or appreciate the mitigation scheme and would not properly\r\nconsider mitigation.  Chadwick's statements that drug use was \"not an excuse\" and that she\r\nwould have to see \"something massive\" in order to find sufficient mitigation did not render\r\nher challengeable for cause.<sup> (26)</sup>   Point of error ten is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's eleventh point of error concerns prospective juror Phillip Magee.  Magee\r\nexpressed the view that he did not think that poverty \"in and of itself\" could be sufficiently\r\nmitigating.  He also stated that he did not think that mental illness \"by itself\" would be\r\nmitigating.  At the conclusion of voir dire, counsel challenged Magee, asserting that he was\r\n\"mitigation impaired\" because he could not consider defendant's specific mitigators,\r\nspecifically poverty and mental illness.  However, Magee's statements that he did not think\r\nparticular types of evidence were mitigating \"by themselves\" did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.<sup> (27)</sup>  Point of error eleven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's twelfth point of error concerns prospective juror Catherine Roberts.  The\r\nrecord shows that, at the beginning of voir dire, Roberts indicated that she generally favored\r\nthe death penalty.  When the prosecutor explained the punishment phase to her, she said that\r\nshe would keep an open mind at punishment and make the State prove future dangerousness. \r\nShe also affirmed that she could keep an open mind concerning mitigation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRoberts's answers to defense counsel's questions were generally consistent with her\r\nanswers to the prosecutor's questions.  When defense counsel asked Roberts whether she\r\nthought that poverty or education would be sufficiently mitigating, she responded that they\r\nwould not.  When counsel asked her whether mental illness, child abuse, and spousal abuse\r\nwould be sufficiently mitigating, Roberts answered that they could be, \"depending on all the\r\nevidence.\"  Defense counsel then challenged Roberts on the grounds that she would not be\r\nable to \"presume a life sentence\" and that she was mitigation-impaired because she would\r\nnot consider poverty and education as mitigating factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record does not support appellant's assertion that Roberts would be unable to\r\npresume that a life sentence would be appropriate after she found appellant guilty but before\r\nshe heard the evidence at the penalty phase.  When the law was explained to her, Roberts\r\naffirmed that she would make the State prove future dangerousness.  Roberts's views as to\r\nwhether particular types of evidence would be sufficiently mitigating did not render her\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Point of error twelve is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's thirteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Billy Esparza.  At the\r\nbeginning of voir dire, Esparza indicated that he generally favored the death penalty.  When\r\nthe prosecutor explained the punishment phase and the special issues to him, he indicated that\r\nhe would presume that a sentence of life without parole would be appropriate until the State\r\nproved the defendant's future dangerousness.  Initially, Esparza did not see a difference\r\nbetween the terms \"possibility\" and \"probability,\" but he indicated that he understood the\r\ndifference after the prosecutor explained it to him.  Esparza affirmed that he would keep an\r\nopen mind and listen to all the evidence before he decided the mitigation issue.  He stated\r\nthat he did not think that substance abuse, poverty, or education would be mitigating, but he\r\nsaid that he would keep an open mind and listen to all the evidence before making a decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen defense counsel asked Esparza about the distinction between probability and\r\npossibility, Esparza hesitated to give a direct answer.  However, Esparza eventually affirmed\r\nthat the term \"probability\" signified something more than \"possibility\":</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tLet me talk about one other thing. . . . The prosecutor talked to you about the\r\ndefinition of \"probability.\" Do you remember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tWhat was your definition of \"probability?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tI think I said 50/50.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tOne of the things that concerned me, you said possibility and probability were\r\nthe same thing.  You remember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tI don't think I said they were the same thing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tTell me, you see the difference between probability and possibility?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tHow could they be the same?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tNo, the difference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tThe difference?  I don't know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tYou understand the law says that it's a probability?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tThere are no definitions for these words. . . . I submit there's a definite\r\ndistinction between probability and possibility[.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes, okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tDo you see any distinction after the prosecutor went over it with you and\r\ntalked about more than a mere possibility as far as definition of \"probability\"? \r\nDo you understand that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tDo you have any questions for me, Mr. Esparza?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \tNo, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>At the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Esparza on the grounds that he\r\nwas mitigation-impaired in that he was unable to consider poverty or education as a\r\nmitigating factor.  Counsel also challenged Esparza on the ground that he had \"a problem\r\n[with] the definitions of 'possible' and 'probable.'\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEsparza's views that poverty and education were not mitigating did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Although he expressed some initial confusion concerning the\r\ndistinction between \"probability\" and \"possibility,\" he understood and accepted the\r\ndistinction once it had been explained to him.  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the challenge for cause.<sup> (28)</sup>  Point of error thirteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fourteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Michael Davis. \r\nDuring the State's examination, Davis said that he could keep an open mind and consider all\r\nthe evidence in answering the future dangerousness and mitigation questions.  During the\r\ndefense's examination, counsel asked Davis what the result would be if he found the\r\ndefendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness question affirmatively.  Davis\r\nreplied, \"[P]robably the death penalty.\"  Counsel asked Davis if his mind would be made up\r\nat that point, and he agreed that it would be.  However, Davis then said that the death penalty\r\nshould be invoked at that point \"unless there's just mitigating circumstances to sway me the\r\nother way.\"  Counsel asked Davis, if he found defendant guilty and a future danger, \"[N]ow\r\ncan you go forward and look at that [mitigating evidence] and unring the bell?\"  Davis\r\nanswered, \"Yes.\"  But then, when counsel asked, \"There isn't anything you would ever\r\nconsider to be mitigating to unring that bell, so to speak?\"  Davis responded, \"Uh, yeah.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court questioned Davis in order to clarify his responses.  During this questioning,\r\nDavis indicated that after he found a defendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness\r\nquestion affirmatively, the result would be a death sentence if he did not find sufficiently\r\nmitigating evidence, but a life sentence if he found sufficient mitigation.  At the conclusion\r\nof voir dire, counsel challenged Davis on the grounds that he was \"mitigation-impaired,\" and\r\nthat once he found the defendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness question\r\naffirmatively, he would not consider mitigating factors.  Counsel also asserted that after\r\nfinding the defendant guilty, Davis would always find the defendant to be a future danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Davis gave inconsistent answers with regard to whether he\r\nwould consider mitigating evidence, but he affirmed on several occasions that he would\r\nfollow the law and consider mitigating evidence.  Appellant's assertion that Davis would\r\nalways find the defendant to be a future danger is not supported by the record.  We afford\r\nparticular deference to the trial court's determination that Davis was not challengeable for\r\ncause.<sup> (29)</sup>  Point of error fourteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fifteenth point of error concerns prospective juror John Reeves.  In\r\naddition to setting out the grounds for defense counsel's challenge to Reeves, appellant\r\n\"submits that the use of the phrase 'trips up juror[s]' by the State influenced this juror's\r\nanswers in that it made him aware of how he needed to answer the question of future\r\ndangerousness to be qualified as a juror rather than expressing his true feelings concerning\r\nthe death penalty.\"  We understand appellant to mean that the prosecutor's use of this phrase\r\nimpeded the defense's ability to develop a challenge for cause by discouraging Reeves from\r\nanswering defense counsel's questions candidly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring voir dire, the prosecutor discussed the law applicable to the guilt phase, and\r\nthen explained that, if the jurors found the defendant guilty, they would be given two\r\nquestions at the punishment phase.  The prosecutor explained that, after finding the defendant\r\nguilty and before hearing any evidence at the punishment phase, the jury would have to\r\npresume that life in prison would be the appropriate punishment.  Reeves stated that he\r\nwould keep an open mind in answering the future dangerousness question and not\r\nautomatically assume that the defendant would be a future danger.  The prosecutor then\r\ncontinued:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol type=\"A\">\r\n  <li><span>\tI'm gonna go back here.  Never fails, once I have no further questions\r\nfor you and [defense counsel] gets to ask you questions, he always trips\r\nup jurors on this.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAt the point you have found someone guilty.  Think where we\r\nare on this.  The point you have actually found him guilty.  And you\r\nfound him guilty of a horrendous, horrible murder, multiple people,\r\nwith no justification, not an accident, not self-defense; [he's] not\r\ndefending a third person; he's not insane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWhat are your thoughts on the death penalty at that point?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI certainly would be leaning in that direction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tOkay.  Now, I think that's normal.  That's where he trips 'em up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYour honor, I object to comments on counsel as far as --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tThey just have different points of view when they ask you questions,\r\nMr.-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWhy should I get tripped up?  Why should I be any different?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYour opinions are fine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAt this point, as a juror, though, you haven't heard punishment\r\nevidence yet.  So you, as a juror, cannot be leaning towards the death\r\npenalty.  In fact, just the opposite; you have to be leaning towards life\r\nuntil the state proves to you it should be death.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tYou see what I mean?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tYes.  I assume you're saying you almost-if you can, you're almost\r\nwiping the slate almost clean to proceed to the next basic trial part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tUntil you can hear everything.  Then you can consider the fact that you\r\nfound him guilty.  You can't automatically lean towards death.  The law\r\nwants you to listen to everything.  May be something in his background.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI took your question to mean: If that's all there was at that point, what\r\nwould your feelings be?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tI can tell you that if the state weren't seeking the death penalty and you\r\nfound someone guilty of the same crime it's an automatic life sentence. \r\nMaybe it's easier to think in terms of that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tThat's probably a better way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tAt the point you found him guilty, that's a life sentence, okay?  That's\r\na life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tNow, if the state puts on evidence . . . that convinces you beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that he's probably gonna continue being a danger,\r\neven in prison, at that point you get to change that to a death sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tDoes that - </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tMakes more sense, yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tIf I come back and ask you again: At the point you just found him\r\nguilty, as a juror, what are you thinking?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tAs a juror.  Right now I'm at life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tSo you-you know, it is a mental exercise.  What it really comes down\r\nto, is it a mental exercise that you feel you can give more than lip\r\nservice, that you could actually do as a juror?  Or would you have\r\nfeelings you really would be leaning towards a death sentence,\r\nhonestly, and it may not be something you could actually give more\r\nthan lip service to?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I could do the right way, as you explained.  I think not knowing\r\nanything about the procedure before coming here, not knowing what\r\nthe circumstances were with regards to the death penalty and that type\r\nthing-regardless what my answers were, I didn't know.  And I said, just\r\na layman, we would think a horrendous crime, you would lean.  Now\r\nyou explained there's two procedures and the proper way to do it.  But\r\njust coming in here, I would [lean toward the death penalty].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tObviously, it would be unfair to get into the facts at this point, try to\r\ncommit you one way or the other.  I can, however, assure you it's\r\ncapital murder.  It's gonna be a horrific crime, no matter which way you\r\nlook at it, by the nature of the crime. . . . The law says you still go with\r\nthat automatic assumption it's a life sentence unless you hear something\r\nin either phase of the trial that convinces you he's gonna be a\r\ncontinuing danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tSo you're telling me, \"If the law requires that of me, I can d[o]\r\nit\"?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tOr, \"I think I can do it\"?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI can do it, yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor then discussed the mitigation issue, and Reeves said that he would\r\ngive it fair consideration if the jury reached that question after finding the defendant guilty\r\nand finding that the defendant would be a future danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel remarked on the prosecutor's use of the words, \"trips 'em up\" during\r\nhis examination of Reeves:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou know, it's funny.  [The prosecutor] used the words \"tripped you up.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tI want to use words they use: \"follow the law,\" \"be fair and impartial.\" \r\nThose are all words that I think sometimes, even the judge points out, it makes\r\nsomeone answer in a way they think they're supposed to answer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIf I came up and said, \"Mr. Reeves, this is the law.  You can follow the\r\nlaw, can't you,\" that implies that the answer is yes and it's harder to say no in\r\nthat situation.  That's what the judge was talking about when he talked to you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAll we want is honest answers here.  There are laws that people\r\ndisagree with.

All right.  So what I want to look at is put you in a hypothetical.  You\r\nanswered this originally one way with the prosecutor.  She had used the words\r\n\"tripped up.\"  It's not.

If that's the way\r\nsomeone leans, one way or another, that's what we need to know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tSure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tThe hypothetical gets to this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIf you're on a jury, hypothetically, you and 11 other individuals find\r\nsomeone guilty of capital murder.  As the prosecutor explained to you, it's\r\ngonna be a heinous crime.  It's a capital murder.  You can imagine it's horrific. \r\nPerson intended to commit the crime, meant to kill two people.  Wasn't self-defense[;] wasn't defense of another person; individual wasn't insane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAs the prosecutor said, at that point what are your thoughts on the death\r\npenalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWe have already decided?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou have determined he's guilty of capital murder.  See I used it four times,\r\nbut it's tripped up-but people are-if you found someone guilty, people\r\ntypically say, \"You know what?  The death penalty.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think not knowing what I know now, you assume that's what you would think\r\nin a death-penalty case.  Been explained a little differently to me.  The real\r\nquestion is can I change my thinking, in the second phase.  I feel I can.  My\r\nanswer is quite honest.  Coming in here, that's my normal reaction. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tThat's what I want to get to.  When the rubber hits the road, can you do it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tA lot of people said, \"I might be able to.\"  I give the example like\r\ngetting on a plane flying to Austin and the pilot says, \"I think I can get us\r\nthere.  I might be able to.\"  You don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling at that point\r\nand might be heading for the exit door.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tThat's where it's difficult; can someone really do that?  The prosecutor\r\nused the words of a \"mental exercise.\"  It's more than that.  It's really looking\r\nintrospectively at yourself: \"Can I do this?  Setting aside my initial reaction,\r\nwhich is leaning towards the death penalty or something, that you know what? \r\nI'm probably gonna get in there and will probably lean towards that side.  I\r\nknow the law tells me to do one thing.  I'm supposed to presume life.  I don't\r\nknow if I can.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tPush comes to shove, that's what I'm trying to find out.  It extends to\r\nthe next question.  Tell me your thoughts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I'm on board with the special issue question so I think that helps me in\r\nseparating myself from the guilty to the punishment phase.  The second board\r\nup there with the special issue, that helps me say yes, I'm able to do it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou used a couple [of] terms that perk my ears up: \"I think I can,\" \"I can\r\nprobably.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWell, it's a tough one.  This is all new to me of-I'm not there.  You are.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tI understand.  That's the dilemma people get in with the answers. \r\nUnfortunately, the law requires yes-or-no answers.  I'm not saying-I told you\r\nthe law.  Someone's supposed to, but the question is, can you do that?  If you\r\ncan, that's fine.  If you can't, I need to know i[t].  Unfortunately, can't accept\r\n\"I think\" or \"probably.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I can.  I know I can do it.  I can do this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tReeves continued to agree that he could follow the law concerning future\r\ndangerousness.  He also stated that he would consider mitigating circumstances.  When\r\ndefense counsel questioned him about specific types of potentially mitigating evidence,\r\nReeves indicated that he would consider poverty and education \"to a small degree\" as\r\nmitigating factors, and he would consider mental illness to a greater degree.  Counsel then\r\nchallenged Reeves for cause on the grounds that he would be leaning towards death and\r\nwould always find future dangerousness after finding the defendant guilty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record reflects that, once the law was explained to him, Reeves agreed that he\r\ncould set aside his personal feelings and follow the law, and he would not automatically lean\r\ntoward the death penalty.  In addition, the record does not support appellant's assertion that\r\nReeves would always find future dangerousness after finding the defendant guilty.  Point of\r\nerror fifteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's sixteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Ronald Jarvis.  Counsel\r\nchallenged Jarvis on the ground that he was \"mitigation impaired\" and would not consider\r\npoverty as a mitigating factor.  The record shows that Jarvis indicated that he would place\r\nthe burden on the defense to show sufficiently mitigating evidence, and he did not consider\r\npoverty to be a mitigating factor.  Neither of these facts rendered him challengeable for\r\ncause.<sup> (30)</sup>  Point of error sixteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's seventeenth point of error concerns prospective juror Susan Cassel.  He\r\ncontends that Cassel was challengeable for cause under Article 35.16(a)(5), which provides\r\nthat a challenge for cause may be made by either the state or the defense for the reason that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>the juror has such defect in the organs of feeling or hearing, or such bodily or\r\nmental defect or disease as to render the juror unfit for jury service, or that the\r\njuror is legally blind and the court in its discretion is not satisfied that the juror\r\nis fit for jury service in that particular case[.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A \"mental defect\" may be present when the prospective juror's responses show an inability\r\nto understand the jury's role in capital proceedings.<sup> (31)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring voir dire, Cassel said that she understood and would follow the law concerning\r\nthe State's burden of proof at the guilt phase.  She also stated that after finding a defendant\r\nguilty, she could presume that a life sentence was the proper punishment.  She affirmed that\r\nshe could presume that the defendant would not be a future danger, unless and until the State\r\nproved future dangerousness during the punishment phase.  Cassel also said that she would\r\nbe open to considering mitigating circumstances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNear the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel asked Cassel if she had any\r\nquestions for him.  Cassel asked for clarification about the timing of the different parts of the\r\ntrial.  Counsel explained that the guilt phase would come first, and then, if the jury found the\r\ndefendant guilty, the punishment phase would follow.  During punishment, the jury would\r\nhear evidence concerning both future dangerousness and mitigation, all at the same time. \r\nThe jury would then retire to deliberate on the future dangerousness question and then, if the\r\njury found that the defendant was a future danger, the jury would deliberate on the mitigation\r\nquestion.  Cassel thanked defense counsel for this information.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCounsel then challenged Cassel for cause, asserting,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJudge, at this time we spent over an hour and a half speaking to this\r\njuror.  It's clear she does not have the mental capacity to fully understand the\r\nnature of the issues before her and we do not feel that-I mean, we have had to\r\ngo back and cover these things in depth on every point that applies and she's\r\nbeen very-wavered back and forth as far as whether or not she has an\r\nunderstanding what's being asked as well as an appreciation of the issues\r\ninvolved.  We feel that her inability to understand the issues, to understand- </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI'm talking to her about the special issues in punishment and she's\r\ngoing back asking how the trial works.  That's not the kind of juror that the\r\nlaw envision[s] sitting on this type of case. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe would challenge the juror for cause for a lack of appreciation and\r\nunderstanding of the process and we would ask the court to excuse this juror\r\nfor cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The trial court responded, \"I'm not sure, Mr. Johnson, whether you and I just observed the\r\nsame juror [for] an hour and a half.  Be that as it may, your motion that she be stricken for\r\ncause is denied.\"  Counsel then requested an additional peremptory strike, which was denied,\r\nand he identified Cassel as an objectionable juror.  Cassel was seated as the twelfth juror.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis record does not demonstrate that Cassel had any bodily or mental defect that\r\nrendered her unfit for jury service.  The record shows only that, when defense counsel asked\r\nCassel if she had any questions, she asked him for clarification about the timing of the\r\ndifferent parts of the trial.  Counsel answered her question, and she thanked him.  The trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's challenge for cause.  Point of error\r\nseventeen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause appellant must show that the trial court erred by denying his challenges for\r\ncause to three prospective jurors, we need not consider his third and fourth points of error,<sup> (32)</sup>\r\nand they are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error eighteen and nineteen, appellant asserts that, as a result of the errors\r\nalleged in points one through seventeen, the jury as constituted was biased or prejudiced, thus\r\ndepriving appellant of a fair trial in violation of the United States Constitution and the Texas\r\nConstitution.<sup> (33)</sup>  We have found no error with respect to appellant's individual jury selection points of error,\r\nand so these points, complaining of cumulative error, are also without merit.  Points of error\r\neighteen and nineteen are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B. \tMotion for Separate Juries</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twentieth point of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying\r\nhis pretrial motion to impanel separate juries for the guilt phase and the penalty phase. \r\nAppellant urges that the effect of the death-qualification process on appellant's jury violated\r\nhis right to a fair trial \"as embodied in the concepts of equal protection [and] due process\r\nunder both the Texas and United States Constitution[s].\"<sup> (34)</sup>  He cites to social-science studies\r\nreporting that death-qualified jurors are more conviction-prone and more likely to believe\r\nthat the law favors the death penalty as an appropriate punishment than jurors who have not\r\ngone through the death-qualification process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Supreme Court has rejected similar claims that relied, in part, on\r\nthe same social studies cited by appellant.<sup> (35)</sup>  After identifying \"some of the more serious\r\nproblems\" with those studies, the Supreme Court held that, even if those studies established\r\nthat the death-qualification process does in fact produce juries that are somewhat more\r\nconviction-prone, \"the Constitution does not prohibit the States from 'death qualifying' juries\r\nin capital cases.\"<sup> (36)</sup>  This Court has also rejected the argument that the death-qualification\r\nprocess unconstitutionally influences jurors to favor the death penalty.<sup> (37)</sup>  Furthermore, there\r\nis no constitutional impediment to a determination of sentence by the same jury that\r\ndetermined guilt.<sup> (38)</sup>  Point of error twenty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C. \tSpecial Issues Not Charged in Indictment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-first point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred by denying\r\nhis pretrial motion to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option because the\r\nindictment did not include notice of the penalty-phase special issues, and these issues are\r\nelements of the offense that must be pleaded in the indictment.  He acknowledges that we\r\nhave rejected similar claims.<sup> (39)</sup>  We are not persuaded to reconsider our prior decisions.  Point\r\nof error twenty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tSpectator Outburst at the Punishment Phase</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts in his twenty-second point of error that the trial court committed\r\nerror by not declaring a mistrial after a spectator caused a disturbance in the presence of the\r\njury.  He argues that the disturbance was an external influence on the jurors, and that the trial\r\ncourt's refusal to grant a mistrial violated his constitutional right to be tried by impartial\r\njurors whose verdict is based solely on the evidence at trial.  He further asserts that the\r\nspectator's conduct was \"designed to deny appellant a fair trial.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's denial of a request for a mistrial is reviewed under an abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard.<sup> (40)</sup>  An appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe trial court's ruling, considering only those arguments before the court at the time of the\r\nruling.<sup> (41)</sup>  The ruling must be upheld if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement.<sup> (42)</sup> \r\n A mistrial is an extreme remedy that should be granted \"only when residual prejudice\r\nremains\" after less drastic alternatives have been explored.<sup> (43)</sup>  When the party requesting a\r\nmistrial does not first request a lesser remedy, we will not reverse the court's judgment if the\r\nproblem could have been cured by a less drastic alternative.<sup> (44)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSpectator conduct that impedes normal trial proceedings will not result in reversible\r\nerror unless the defendant shows a reasonable probability that the conduct interfered with the\r\njury's verdict.<sup> (45)</sup>  Injury to a defendant is measured on a case-by-case basis.<sup> (46)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the record shows that, during the prosecutor's closing argument at the\r\npunishment phase, the proceedings were interrupted when a man rushed toward a break in\r\nthe rail that separated the spectators from the \"attorney-accessible-only area\" of the\r\ncourtroom.  The prosecutor had been arguing that mercy was not appropriate in this case:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe know Robert Sparks' background, how he grew up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYou know, Robert Sparks' mom came and testified yesterday and she\r\ntestified that Robert was two or three years old and would wake up in the\r\nmiddle of the night.

This is the second time this individual has\r\ndisrupted the court proceedings during portions of the descriptions of the\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd if the court will allow, I'll make an offer of proof it's my\r\nunderstanding this is the same individual that during testimony in the guilt/\r\ninnocence phase of the trial, jumped up, started yelling and had to be escorted\r\nout of the courtroom by the prosecution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWe objected at that time.  The court-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tThis case?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYes.  In fact, the court told members of the jury [sic; audience] if there was any\r\nmore outbursts in regards to testimony, they would be barred from the\r\ncourtroom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter an off-the-record discussion at the bench, appellant's counsel continued:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense: \tJudge, there's been discussion at sidebar in regards to the exact timing of when\r\nthis-the exact events occurred.  There was an outburst in the testimony of the\r\nguilt/innocence phase, and due to that outburst, my recollection, the court was\r\ngoing to excuse the jury to admonish the jury-or admonish the audience any\r\nfurther outbursts would result in any individuals being barred from further\r\nadmittance into the courtroom, which time the jury was standing up at-the\r\nprosecutor Heath Harris was required to get up and take Harold Sublet, Sr.,\r\nand escort him out of the courtroom because he again approached the rail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIt's my recollection, Judge, and I believe it to be accurate, and would\r\ncall Heath Harris to testify.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tAfter arguments you can make your bill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tWhat's your motion?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tJust let the record to reflect that now, in the conclusion or portion of [the\r\nprosecutor's] argument in regards to the infliction of wounds on Harold Sublet,\r\nSr.-Jr., this same individual's now rushed the jury rail in front of the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tWe believe this type of thing has prejudiced the defendant in the eyes\r\nof the jury.  This individual again has been escorted out of the courtroom by\r\nthe prosecutor Heath Harris, as well as several members of the bailiff[']s staff. \r\nWe believe that. . . in the jury's eyes we have been prejudiced and ask the\r\ncourt to grant a mistrial at this time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAll right. [A]ny response?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tAsk the court to deny the motion.  The jury doesn't know who this fella is,\r\nwho he's related to.  They can draw their own conclusion and has got nothing\r\nto do with their deliberations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tI'm gonna deny your motion for mistrial.  So the record's clear, I'll give each\r\nside a chance to supplement the record later with their recollection of prior\r\noccurrences.<sup>[</sup><sup> (48)</sup><sup>]</sup>  Mine's a little different than [defense counsel's].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The court admonished the members of the audience that any further outbursts would result\r\nin the person who caused the outburst being jailed and held in contempt.  The jury was then\r\nescorted back into the courtroom, and the prosecutor continued his closing argument without\r\nfurther interruption.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the past, we have found that an emotional outburst from members of the victim's\r\nfamily was not harmful when the outburst was non-verbal and the jury was immediately\r\nremoved from the courtroom.<sup> (49)</sup>   In <em>Landry,</em> the decedent's family members testified during\r\nthe trial with such emotion that the court recessed at several points in order to allow them to\r\nregain their composure before continuing.<sup> (50)</sup>  Later, during the defendant's closing argument,\r\nthe decedent's widow and brother caused a commotion in the audience, and the judge retired\r\nthe jury.<sup> (51)</sup>  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, noting for the record that he had been\r\ninterrupted by an emotional outburst from the decedent's widow, who \"was in the process\r\nof fainting and leaving the courtroom,\" and also by an outcry from the decedent's brother that\r\nwas loud enough to be heard near the jury rail.<sup> (52)</sup>  Finding it significant that these outbursts\r\ndid not involve any verbal outcries and that the jury was immediately removed from the\r\ncourtroom, we held that appellant had failed to demonstrate how these emotional responses\r\nreasonably could have interfered with the jury's verdict.<sup> (53)</sup></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMore recently, we held that a spectator's verbal, emotional outburst did not require\r\na mistrial.  In <em>Gamboa,</em> during a State's witness's testimony, a family member of the murder\r\nvictim shouted, \"You did this for 200 dollars?\"<sup> (54)</sup>  We determined that the trial court's\r\nstatement to the jury that the outburst was made by someone who was not a witness and not\r\nunder oath, coupled with the court's instruction to disregard what was said, was sufficient\r\nto cure the impropriety.<sup> (55)</sup>  We held that nothing in the record suggested that the outburst was\r\nof such a nature that the jury could not ignore it and fairly examine the evidence in arriving\r\nat a verdict.<sup> (56)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, Harold Sublet, Sr., never testified.  As the prosecutor pointed out, the jurors did\r\nnot know who he was, but could \"draw their own conclusions.\"  Further, the conduct at issue\r\nwas Sublet's non-verbal, emotional response to the prosecutor's closing argument.  Rushing\r\ntoward the jury rail was, arguably, more disruptive than the conduct at issue in <em>Landry</em> and\r\n<em>Gamboa,</em> but Sublet was quickly escorted out of the courtroom, and the jury was immediately\r\nremoved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the harm, if any, could have been cured by an instruction to disregard,\r\nappellant did not request this \"lesser remedy.\"<sup> (57)</sup>  Further, appellant has not carried his burden\r\nof showing a reasonable probability that the outburst interfered with the jury's verdict or\r\nposed a reasonable probability of injury to himself.  Appellant offers only conclusory\r\nassertions that this disturbance violated his constitutional right to an impartial jury and was\r\n\"designed\" to deny him a fair trial.  Point of error twenty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E. \tJury Instructions at the Guilt Stage</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error twenty-three, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury instruction at the guilt phase on temporary insanity caused by involuntary\r\nintoxication.  He argues that evidence of his belief that Chare had been giving him \"yard\r\ntreatment poison\" was evidence of involuntary intoxication.  He also points to Shunta's\r\ntestimony that, when appellant showed up in front of her house shortly after the offense, he\r\nwas behaving strangely and she thought he was on drugs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Section 8.01 of the Penal Code, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution that,\r\nat the time of the conduct charged, the defendant, as a result of severe mental disease or\r\ndefect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.<sup> (58)</sup>  We have held that Section 8.01(a)\r\nimplicitly encompasses the defense of temporary insanity due to involuntary intoxication.<sup> (59)</sup> \r\nAccordingly, in deciding whether the evidence raises the defense of involuntary intoxication,\r\nwe examine whether (1) the defendant exercised no independent judgment or volition in\r\ntaking the intoxicant; and (2) as a result of a \"severe mental disease or defect\" caused by the\r\ninvoluntary intoxication, the accused did not know that his conduct was wrong.<sup> (60)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the requested jury instruction did not correctly recite the applicable law. \r\nInstead, the requested instruction recited the law as it existed prior to legislative amendments\r\nin 1983:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>You are instructed that involuntary intoxication is a defense to prosecution for\r\nan offense when it is shown that the accused has exercised no independent\r\njudgment or volition in taking the intoxicant and that as a result of his\r\nintoxication the accused did not know that his conduct was wrong, or [was\r\nin]capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law allegedly\r\nviolated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When appellant committed this offense, it was no longer an affirmative defense to\r\nprosecution that the defendant, as a result of involuntary intoxication, was incapable of\r\nconforming his conduct to the requirements of the law.<sup> (61)</sup>  Therefore, appellant was not\r\nentitled to the specific instruction that he requested.<sup> (62)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the record shows that, during the charge conference at the guilt phase,\r\ndefense counsel explained that he was requesting the instruction on temporary insanity due\r\nto involuntary intoxication because appellant wanted it.  Counsel did not distinctly specify\r\nthe ground or basis for this requested instruction as required by Article 36.14.  Further, we\r\nare unable to find any evidence in the record that would support a finding that appellant did\r\nnot know that his conduct of stabbing his wife and two stepsons to death was \"wrong.\"<sup> (63)</sup>  In\r\nhis brief on appeal, appellant points to evidence that he believed his family was poisoning\r\nhim, but he fails to cite any record evidence that would support a rational jury finding that\r\nhe did not know that his murderous conduct was \"wrong.\"  Nor did he cite any such evidence\r\nto the trial judge when he requested this jury instruction.  Having failed to point out the\r\nfactual basis for his requested instruction to the trial judge, appellant failed to preserve this\r\nissue for appeal.<sup> (64)</sup>  Point of error twenty-three is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error twenty-four, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury charge at the guilt phase on self-defense.  He argues that his belief that he was\r\nbeing poisoned entitled him to this instruction, and that denying the instruction denied him\r\nthe right to present his defenses to the jury and therefore denied him his right to a fair trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA person is justified in using deadly force against another when and to the extent that\r\nhe reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect himself against another's\r\nuse or attempted use of unlawful deadly force.<sup> (65)</sup>  A defendant is justified in defending against\r\ndanger as he reasonably apprehends it.<sup> (66)</sup>  If the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable\r\nto the defendant, does not establish self-defense, the defendant is not entitled to an\r\ninstruction.<sup> (67)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant was not entitled to a self-defense instruction under the facts of this case. \r\nAppellant was charged with the murders of Harold and Raekwon, but he does not assert that\r\nhe reasonably believed that deadly force against his nine- and ten-year-old stepsons was\r\nimmediately necessary to protect himself.  At trial, there was no evidence that appellant\r\nreasonably apprehended any deadly force from his stepsons.  Appellant confessed that the\r\nboys were asleep in their bedroom when he decided to kill them, and that he went into their\r\nroom and woke them up, one by one,  to kill them.  Under these circumstances, the trial court\r\ndid not err in refusing appellant's requested instructions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the record shows that, during the charge conference at the guilt phase,\r\ndefense counsel requested a jury instruction on self-defense.  Counsel explained that he was\r\nrequesting the instruction because appellant wanted it.  Counsel did not specify the facts or\r\nlegal theory that supported the submission of this defense.  Therefore, the error was forfeited\r\non appeal.<sup> (68)</sup>  Point of error twenty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>F. \tExpert Witness at the Punishment Phase</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-fifth point of error, appellant asserts, \"The trial court erred in overruling\r\nappellant's objection to the proffered expert testimony of witness A.P. Merillat.\"  Appellant\r\nargues that Merillat testified about subjects-the prison classification system and opportunities\r\nfor violence in the penitentiary-that were beyond his expertise.<sup> (69)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Evidence 702 permits a witness qualified by knowledge, skill,\r\nexperience, training, or education to testify on scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\nsubjects if the testimony would assist the trier of fact in understanding or determining a fact\r\nissue.  The party presenting the witness as an expert has the burden of proving that the expert\r\nis qualified.<sup> (70)</sup>  A witness's qualification to give an expert opinion may be derived from\r\nspecialized education, practical experience, a study of technical works, or a varying\r\ncombination of these things.<sup> (71)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen addressing fields of study that are based primarily upon experience and training\r\nas opposed to the scientific method, the appropriate questions are: (1) whether the field of\r\nexpertise is a legitimate one; (2) whether the subject matter of the expert's testimony is\r\nwithin the scope of that field; and (3) whether the expert's testimony properly relies upon\r\nand/or utilizes the principles involved in the field.<sup> (72)</sup>  The fact that the general subject matter\r\nis within the comprehension of the average jury does not require the exclusion of expert\r\ntestimony.<sup> (73)</sup>  \tThe question of whether a witness offered as an expert possesses the required\r\nqualifications is a question resting largely in the trial court's discretion.<sup> (74)</sup>  Absent a clear\r\nabuse of discretion, the trial court's decision to admit or exclude testimony will not be\r\ndisturbed.<sup> (75)</sup>  The appellate court must uphold the trial court's ruling if it was within the zone\r\nof reasonable disagreement.<sup> (76)</sup>  Appellate courts may consider several criteria in assessing\r\nwhether a trial court has clearly abused its discretion in ruling on an expert's qualifications,\r\nincluding the complexity of the field of expertise, the conclusiveness of the expert's opinion,\r\nand the centrality of the area of expertise to the case.<sup> (77)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the Rule 705 hearing, A.P. Merillat testified that he was a criminal investigator for\r\nthe Special Prosecutions Unit, which investigates and prosecutes offenses within the prison\r\nsystem.  Merillat testified that he had been investigating such crimes for almost twenty years\r\nand that he had testified in court many times concerning (1) the prison classification system\r\nthat would apply to convicted capital murderers who received life sentences; and (2) the\r\nopportunities for convicted capital murderers to be violent in prison.  Merillat acknowledged\r\nthat his knowledge of these subjects was mostly anecdotal, derived from his own\r\ninvestigations of prison crimes.  He testified that the Special Prosecutions Unit is not part of\r\nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"), but that he spent a year working with\r\ninternal affairs at TDCJ on use-of-force cases.  Merillat testified that he would not be giving\r\nan expert opinion particular to appellant's case but instead would testify generally about\r\nopportunities to be violent in the prison system.  Defense counsel questioned the need for\r\nexpert testimony on this subject, asserting that it was \"just common sense\" that there were\r\nopportunities for violence in prison.  Merillat responded that he had learned things through\r\nhis job that the general public, as well as most prison officials and politicians, did not know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel repeatedly expressed concern that Merillat would testify about\r\nspecific bad acts by individual prisoners in order to scare the jury.  Counsel argued that he\r\nwould have no way to verify the facts of these offenses if Merillat testified about them. \r\nCounsel also argued that Merillat was not qualified to testify about general classification and\r\nprison operations.  The trial court indicated that Merillat would not be allowed to testify\r\nabout particular incidents, but he would be allowed to answer general questions and testify\r\nabout numbers or statistics.  Counsel then questioned Merillat about his qualifications to\r\ntestify concerning numbers and statistics.  Merillat responded by referring to a list containing\r\nthe names of convicted capital murderers and the offenses they had committed while they\r\nwere in prison.  He stated that he expected to use that list as proof of his knowledge of the\r\nopportunities for violence in prison.  The only statistics he proposed to discuss were\r\ncontained in a report prepared by TDCJ.  Merillat acknowledged that anyone could testify\r\nabout what the report said, as it was widely available and no special expertise was required\r\nto interpret it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tToward the end of the hearing, counsel argued, \"He's not an expert in the field.  All\r\nhe's here to do is scare them about some anecdotal information he has about particular cases\r\nhe investigated in the past.  That's just a job, not expertise.\"  The trial court disagreed, stating\r\nagain that Merillat would be able to answer general questions, but also noting that the court\r\nwould be receptive to counsel's objections to testimony concerning specific incidents.  The\r\ncourt did not grant counsel's written motion in limine concerning specific bad acts because\r\nthe court had not had an opportunity to read through it.  The record does not reflect that\r\ncounsel re-urged his motion in limine before Merillat testified in the presence of the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the jury's presence, the prosecutor began to question Merillat about the prison\r\nclassification system, and defense counsel asked for an opportunity to conduct additional voir\r\ndire.  Counsel then questioned Merillat about his expertise on prison classification.  Merillat\r\ntestified that he had received the same classification training as TDCJ classification\r\nemployees.  Counsel objected again to Merillat's lack of formal training, pointing out that\r\nhe was never employed by TDCJ even though he spent a year working with TDCJ internal\r\naffairs.  Counsel's objection was overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMerillat then described the prison environment experienced by life-sentenced capital\r\nmurderers classified as G-3 inmates: they could go to chow hall and the library with other\r\ninmates, and they could go to school, medical facilities, and visitation.  They could not work\r\noutside the prison walls without direct armed supervision.  Merillat acknowledged that\r\nTDCJ's classification board could impose additional restrictions based on its review of an\r\ninmate's criminal history and records of bad acts, and in very limited circumstances an\r\ninmate might start out in administrative segregation or with a classification that was more\r\nrestrictive than G-3.  Even with restrictions, however, a significant level of violence occurred\r\nwithin the prison system.  Merillat testified that there were over 14,000 disciplinary\r\nconvictions for assaults by inmates on other inmates, over 5,000 disciplinary reports of\r\nassaults by inmates on staff, and 156 murders in prison between 1984 and 2008.  He also\r\nstated that inmates had escaped from prison.  He described the restrictive environment of\r\ndeath row and testified that even on death row, it was possible to commit crimes.  Merillat\r\nstated  that an inmate could choose to be violent or choose to be peaceable, and he specified\r\nthat he was not expressing any opinions about this particular case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMerillat's testimony was generalized educator-expertise information designed to\r\n\"assist\" the jury under Rule 702.  Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\r\nadmitting it after determining that Merillat was qualified to testify as an expert regarding the\r\nprison classification system and opportunities for violence in prison.  Point of error\r\ntwenty-five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>G. \tVictim-Impact Evidence</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh points of error, appellant asserts that the trial\r\ncourt erred in overruling his objections to State's Exhibits 115 and 116-the \"progress notes\"\r\nwritten by LaKenya and Garysha's therapist-which were admitted at the punishment phase. \r\nAppellant argues, \"The proffered evidence is not relevant as it amounts to extraneous victim\r\nimpact evidence.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that when the prosecutor offered Exhibits 115 and 116 into\r\nevidence, defense counsel objected generally that the information in them was not admissible\r\nand not relevant to any issue before the jury.  He did not specifically object that the exhibits\r\nwere extraneous victim impact evidence.  The trial court instructed counsel for both parties\r\nto approach the bench.  Following an off-the-record discussion, the court overruled the\r\nobjection and admitted the exhibits.  The prosecutor then called Garysha and LaKenya to\r\ntestify about the impact the offense had on them.  Appellant did not object to their\r\ntestimony.<sup> (78)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's specific complaint on appeal that Exhibits 115 and 116 were inadmissible\r\nextraneous victim impact evidence is not preserved by his general relevance objection at\r\ntrial.<sup> (79)</sup>   As appellant failed to preserve error, points of error twenty-six and twenty-seven are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>H. \tSufficiency of Future Dangerousness Evidence</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-eighth point of error, appellant contends that the evidence of his future\r\ndangerousness was legally insufficient.  He asserts that he had no prior violent criminal\r\nbackground and that the defense experts testified that he was a low risk for future\r\ndangerousness.  Appellant further argues that none of the evidence presented at the\r\npunishment phase showed a probability that he would be a continuing threat to society if he\r\nwere sentenced to life in prison.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen reviewing the future dangerousness special issue, we view the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society.<sup> (80)</sup>  The circumstances of\r\nthe offense \"can be among the most revealing evidence of future dangerousness and alone\r\nmay be sufficient to support an affirmative answer to that special issue.\"<sup> (81)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the record contains ample evidence of appellant's future dangerousness.  The\r\nfacts of the offense alone would have been sufficient.  However, the State did not rely solely\r\non the facts of the offense.  At the punishment phase, the prosecutor introduced appellant's\r\njuvenile record, penitentiary packet, and disciplinary records.  The jury learned that, as a\r\njuvenile, appellant had been \"convicted\" of criminal mischief, theft, unlawful carrying of\r\nweapons, and burglary.<sup> (82)</sup>  As an adult, he had been convicted of aggravated robbery.  While\r\nhe was in prison for that offense, his disciplinary violations included failure to obey\r\nreasonable orders, masturbation in public, fighting, assaulting guards, and sodomy.  An\r\ninmate who had been housed with appellant in prison testified that appellant beat him up and\r\nraped him on several occasions.  Several officers testified about appellant's confrontational\r\nand violent behavior while he was in jail awaiting trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo former girlfriends testified that appellant physically assaulted them without\r\nwarning.  Garysha and LaKenya, as well as Chare's sister Nicole, testified about appellant's\r\ncontrolling and abusive behavior towards Chare and her children.  Nicole and LaKenya had\r\nurged Chare to leave appellant.  Nicole testified that, a few days after appellant killed Chare\r\nand the boys and fled to Austin, she was warned by appellant's daughter to stay away from\r\nher house because he had returned to Dallas to kill her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, a rational jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was\r\na probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing\r\nthreat to society.  Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's answer to the\r\nfuture dangerousness special issue.  Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I. \tMitigation Special Issue</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's twenty-ninth point of error, he asserts that due process requires this\r\nCourt to review the sufficiency of mitigation evidence on appeal.  Appellant acknowledges\r\nthat this Court has held that a jury's negative answer to the mitigation special issue in capital\r\ncases will not be reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence, and we have rejected the claim\r\nthat this deprives a defendant of \"meaningful appellate review.\"<sup> (83)</sup>  He further acknowledges\r\nthat we have rejected the claim that, because meaningful appellate review of the jury's\r\nmitigation determination is impossible, the mitigation special issue violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment.<sup> (84)</sup>  We have likewise rejected the claim that it violates the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment.<sup> (85)</sup> <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNotwithstanding precedent, in his thirtieth point of error, appellant asserts that the\r\njury's answer to the mitigation special issue was so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence as to be unjust.  In support of this claim, he describes\r\ntestimony from his mother and aunt \"concerning [his] upbringing and mental illness,\"\r\nincluding his statements to them that Chare was poisoning him and that others were\r\nfollowing him or trying to kill him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe mitigation special issue \"confers upon the jury the ability to dispense mercy, even\r\nafter it has found a defendant eligible for the death penalty.\"<sup> (86)</sup>   There is no evidence that\r\nmust be considered to have mitigating value.<sup> (87)</sup>  \"Whether a particular piece of evidence is\r\nmitigating in the context of [the mitigation special] issue is a normative judgment that is not\r\namenable to appellate review.\"<sup> (88)</sup> </span><span>  We decline to attempt such a review here.  Points of error\r\ntwenty-nine and thirty are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>J. \tConstitutionality of Article 37.071</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-first point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in \"not\r\nconcluding the punishment hearing and imposing a life sentence based on the trial court\r\nbeing made aware of the issues supporting the reversal of the recent death-penalty case of\r\n<em>Smith v. [Texas</em>,<em>]</em> 543 U.S. 37 (2004).\"  Appellant argues that the current punishment scheme\r\nin Texas violates \"the doctrines pronounced\" in several Supreme Court cases<sup> (89)</sup> because the\r\nmitigation special issue is \"nothing more than a nullification issue\" to the future\r\ndangerousness special issue.  Appellant asserts that the jury charges set forth in Article\r\n37.071 compare unfavorably with guidelines promulgated by the American Bar Association.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court cases cited by appellant concern jury instructions that were given\r\nprior to the 1991 amendment to Article 37.071.  That amendment set forth the mitigation\r\ninstruction that was given in appellant's case.<sup> (90)</sup>  Other than his conclusory statement that the\r\ncurrent mitigation issue is \"nothing more than a nullification issue,\" appellant makes no\r\nattempt to explain how the reasoning of cases involving jury instructions from before the\r\n1991 amendment operates to invalidate the jury instructions given in his case.<sup> (91)</sup>  In addition,\r\nappellant does not allege that the jury instructions in his case prevented the jury from giving\r\nmeaningful consideration and effect to any mitigating evidence.  Finally, appellant offers no\r\nsupporting legal authority or argument for his assertion that the trial court had a <em>sua sponte</em>\r\nduty to take the punishment decision away from the jury.  Thus, this claim is inadequately\r\nbriefed.<sup> (92)</sup>  Point of error thirty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-second point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing\r\nto provide a rational process for the jury to decide between a life sentence and the death\r\npenalty.  Appellant's entire argument is that the mitigation issue</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>is made vaguely conditional on the [special issue] on future dangerousness,\r\nburdening the consideration of mitigating circumstances that are not related to\r\nfuture dangerousness with a vague presumption in favor of death if the\r\nmitigating circumstances are somehow not \"sufficient\" in comparison to\r\nsomething not stated in the special issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant fails to specify any action that the trial court was required, but failed, to take.  Nor\r\ndoes he specify any statutory or constitutional violation.  This claim is inadequately briefed,\r\nand we decline to address it.<sup> (93)</sup>  Point of error thirty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-third, thirty-fourth, and thirty-fifth points of error, appellant asserts that\r\nthe trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it should answer \"yes\" to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue so long as 10 jurors agreed that one or more mitigating circumstances exist,\r\nseparately or in conjunction, sufficient to warrant a life sentence.  He complains that the jury\r\nshould have been instructed that the mitigation issue should be answered affirmatively so\r\nlong as 10 jurors agreed, even if they disagreed as to which mitigating circumstance or\r\ncircumstances were sufficient to warrant a life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle 37.071, section 2(f)(3), requires the trial court to instruct jurors that they need\r\nnot agree on what particular evidence supports an affirmative answer to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue.  In this case, the trial court instructed the jurors in accordance with this\r\nrequirement.  To the extent that appellant urges that the instruction required by Article\r\n37.071, and given in his case, is unconstitutional because it does not comply with <em>Mills v.\r\nMaryland, </em>486 U.S. 367 (1988), we have rejected such claims in the past.<sup> (94)</sup>  Points of error\r\nthirty-three, thirty-four, and thirty-five are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error thirty-six and thirty-seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erred\r\nby not informing the jury that a failure to agree unanimously on the mitigation special issue\r\nwould have \"the same dignity and respect\" as a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer and would have the\r\nsame legal effect as a \"no\" answer.  He argues that the failure to give this charge violated\r\nArticle 36.14, which gives effect to the \"due course of law\" provision of the Texas\r\nConstitution and the \"due process\" provision of the United States Constitution by requiring\r\nthat the jury charge distinctly set forth the law applicable to the case.  He asserts that the last\r\nsentence of Article 37.071, section 2(a)(1),<sup> (95)</sup> seeks to suppress and conceal important\r\ninformation from the jurors because they are not informed that a life sentence, rather than a\r\nmistrial, will result from a failure to answer the special issues.  Similarly, in his thirty-eighth\r\nand forty-third points of error, appellant asserts that the \"12/10\" rule in Texas capital jury\r\ncharges is a misrepresentation of the law and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as\r\nwell as a violation of due process because jurors never learn that if the jury as a whole cannot\r\nagree on an answer to one of the special issues, a life sentence will result.  This Court has\r\nrepeatedly rejected similar claims.<sup> (96)</sup>  We are not persuaded to revisit them here.  Points of\r\nerror thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and forty-three are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's thirty-ninth<sup> (97)</sup> point of error, he claims that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option.  He argues that\r\nArticle 37.071 is unconstitutional because it fails to provide a method for the State to\r\ndetermine the deathworthiness of the defendant.  Appellant complains that the method of\r\ndetermining which cases shall be prosecuted as capital offenses, and in which capital cases\r\nthe death penalty will be sought, varies from county to county.  He asserts that the failure of\r\nthe State to set forth uniform and specific standards to determine against whom a death\r\nsentence will be sought violates the principles set forth in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, 531 U.S. 98 (2000),\r\nas well as his rights to equal protection and due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, Sections 13 and 19, of the Texas\r\nConstitution, and Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 1.04.<sup> (98)</sup>  This Court has\r\nrepeatedly rejected similar claims, and we are not persuaded to reconsider them here.<sup> (99)</sup>  Point\r\nof error thirty-nine is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fortieth point of error, appellant claims that Article 37.071 \"is unconstitutional\r\nin violation of the cruel and unusual punishment prohibition because it allows the jury too\r\nmuch discretion to determine who should live and who should die and because it lacks the\r\nminimal standards and guidance necessary for the jury to avoid the arbitrary and capricious\r\nimposition of the death penalty.\"  Appellant argues that, under the present Texas statute, the\r\njury has unfettered discretion that invites and permits arbitrary application of the death\r\npenalty in violation of <em>Furman v. Georgia,</em> 408 U.S. 238 (1972).  He complains that the\r\nmitigation instruction unconstitutionally allows the jury to impose a life sentence \"if, in their\r\nsole discretion, they choose to do so.\"  As such, he reasons, the Texas scheme does not insure\r\na reasonably consistent application of the death penalty.  Appellant also complains that the\r\njury has unfettered discretion because the jury can decide what evidence, if any, is mitigating,\r\nand can choose to completely disregard mitigating evidence.  This Court has repeatedly\r\nrejected claims that the mitigation special issue gives the jury unfettered discretion and\r\npermits the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty, and we are not persuaded\r\nto revisit those decisions here.<sup> (100)</sup>  Point of error forty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-first point of error, appellant claims that Article 37.071 violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution as interpreted in <em>Penry II</em>, 532 U.S. 782 (2001),\r\nbecause the mitigation special issue sends \"mixed signals\" to the jurors, thereby rendering\r\nany verdict intolerable and unreliable.  We have repeatedly rejected similar challenges, and\r\nwe decline to review our prior decisions on this issue.<sup> (101)</sup>  Point of error forty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-second point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying\r\nhis motion to hold that Article 37.071, subsections 2(e) and (f), violate Article I, Sections 10\r\nand 13, of the Texas Constitution, which guarantee that any punishment for an offense will\r\nbe in accordance with the law.  He asserts that subsections 2(e) and (f), which set forth the\r\njury instructions for the mitigation special issue, are not in accordance with the law and are\r\nunconstitutional because they shift the burden of proof to the defendant and essentially\r\nreduce the State's burden of proof concerning punishment.  We have previously rejected\r\nthese claims, and we will not revisit them here.<sup> (102)</sup>  Point of error forty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-fourth point of error, appellant claims that the Texas death penalty scheme\r\nviolated his \"rights against cruel and unusual punishment, [his right to] an impartial jury, and\r\n[his right] to due process\" under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the\r\nUnited States Constitution because of vague and undefined terms in the jury instructions. \r\nSpecifically, appellant argues that the terms \"probability,\" \"continuing threat to society,\" and\r\n\"criminal acts of violence,\" should have been defined in the jury charge at punishment\r\nbecause these terms \"are so vague and indefinite as to be violative of [a]ppellant's\r\nfundamental constitutional rights.\"  We have repeatedly rejected these arguments, and we are\r\nnot persuaded to reconsider them here.<sup> (103)</sup>  Point of error forty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-fifth and forty-sixth points of error, appellant claims that the Texas death\r\npenalty scheme is contrary to the United States and Texas Constitutions because it is\r\nimpossible to simultaneously restrict the jury's discretion to impose the death penalty while\r\nalso allowing the jury unlimited discretion to consider all evidence mitigating against\r\nimposition of the death penalty.<sup> (104)</sup></span><span>  Relying on Justice Blackmun's dissent in <em>Callins v.\r\nCollins</em>, 510 U.S. 1141 (1994), appellant declares that the death penalty scheme is\r\nunconstitutional because it fails to adhere to principled guidelines in weighing punishment\r\nevidence.<sup> (105)</sup>  This Court has repeatedly rejected this claim, and we are not persuaded to\r\nreconsider it.<sup> (106)</sup>  Points of error forty-five and forty-six are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-seventh point of error, appellant claims that the mitigation special issue\r\nis unconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the State with regard to\r\naggravating evidence, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\r\nStates Constitution.  He argues that the mitigation special issue is a conduit for aggravating\r\nas well as mitigating factors, and that by instructing jurors to determine whether there are\r\n\"sufficient\" mitigating circumstances, the mitigation issue in effect tells jurors to consider\r\nany aggravating factors that may outweigh the mitigating factors.  He reasons that the\r\nlanguage of the statute is unconstitutional because it implies that the defense has a burden\r\nto disprove aggravating circumstances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy the time a jury considers the mitigation special issue, jurors cannot increase a\r\ndefendant's maximum punishment because they have already found him guilty and made an\r\naffirmative finding on the future dangerousness special issue.<sup> (107)</sup>  At that point, the jury has\r\nalready determined that aggravating circumstances render the defendant eligible for the death\r\npenalty.<sup> (108)</sup>  Therefore, a trial court does not err in declining to assign the burden on the\r\nmitigation issue to the State.<sup> (109)</sup>  Point of error forty-seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Delivered: October 20, 2010</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do not publish\r\n<p>1.

Witnesses and counsel sometimes referred to Harold as \"Troy\" or \"Junior Mac.\"\r\n</p><p>48.  The record does not reflect that either party supplemented the record with regard to any\r\nprior outbursts.  Our independent review of the record reveals that during a portion of the\r\nprosecutor's opening argument that described Harold's murder, there was crying in the audience\r\nand a pause in the proceedings.  The prosecutor stated, \"I'm sorry.  But [appellant] wasn't\r\nthrough yet,\" and went on to describe the murder of Raekwon.  Later, during the State's\r\nexamination of Chare's sister, Nicole, at the punishment phase, someone in the audience called\r\nout, \"Bring it on.\"  The examination then continued.  We are unable to locate any objection or\r\nmotion responsive to either of these prior outbursts.  We decline to infer preservation or harm\r\nfrom this sparse record.  <em>Cf.

As the State points out, there is considerable evidence that appellant knew that his\r\nconduct was wrong: he repeatedly apologized to Lakenya and Garysha for killing their mother\r\nand brothers and for raping them; he called 911 from Shunta's house and confessed to the\r\ndispatch operator; he told Shunta that, if there was a reward for catching him, his daughter\r\nBrianna should get it; he tried to avoid capture by attempting to change the license plate on his\r\ncar; when he did not succeed in changing the plate, he drove to his mother's house and borrowed\r\nher car; he fled to Austin, but then returned and called a detective to ask about the death penalty\r\nand turning himself in.  \r\n</p><p>64.  <em>See Mays v.

Although appellant, as a juvenile, would have been \"adjudicated delinquent\" rather\r\nthan \"convicted\" of these offenses, in the presence of the jury the prosecutor referred to\r\nappellant's \"certified juvenile conviction record.\"  In addition, appellant's mother testified that\r\nappellant had been \"convicted\" of these offenses as a juvenile.  Appellant's juvenile record,\r\nState's Exhibit 99, reflects that appellant was adjudicated delinquent of possessing prohibited\r\nweapons, unlawful carrying of a weapon, and burglary.  Additionally, his juvenile probation\r\nreport, State's Exhibit 102, reflects that appellant paid restitution in a criminal mischief case and\r\na theft case.

Appellant's brief cites to Article 37.0711, ยง 3(3)(i), which is applicable to convictions\r\nfor offenses committed before September 1, 1991.  Because appellant's offense was committed\r\nin 2007, we presume that he means to cite to the last sentence of Article 37.071, ยง 2(a)(1), which\r\nis the analogous provision applicable to convictions for offenses committed on or after\r\nSeptember 1, 1991.

Appellant was charged with\r\nintentionally and knowingly causing the deaths of Raekwon Agnew<sup> (3)</sup> and Harold Sublet, Jr.,\r\nby stabbing and cutting them with a knife, during the same criminal transaction.  The record\r\nshows that on September 15, 2007, appellant murdered his wife, Chare Agnew, and his 9-\r\nand 10-year-old stepsons, Harold and Raekwon, and he raped his 12- and 14-year-old\r\nstepdaughters, Garysha Brown and LaKenya Agnew.<sup> (4)</sup>  Some time after midnight, when\r\neveryone else in the house was asleep, appellant put his hand over Chare's mouth and\r\nstabbed her eighteen times as she lay in her bed.  He then went into the boys' bedroom.  As\r\nRaekwon lay sleeping, appellant woke Harold and took him to the kitchen, where he stabbed\r\nhim at least 45 times.  He then woke Raekwon, took him to the kitchen, and killed him in the\r\nsame manner.  Appellant dragged the boys' bodies to the living room and covered them with\r\na comforter.  He then went into the girls' bedroom and woke LaKenya.  He pulled her out\r\nof bed at gunpoint, tied her up with bedsheets, and told her he had killed her mother and\r\nbrothers.  He showed her their bodies and told her it was her fault they were dead.  Next, he\r\nwoke Garysha and tied her up with electrical cords, and he tied a washcloth around her\r\nmouth.  He then told LaKenya that in order to save her and her sister's life, one of the girls\r\nwould have to have sex with him.  LaKenya said that she would do it.  Appellant took her to\r\nthe living room and raped her on the living room couch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen he had finished raping LaKenya, appellant took Garysha to the living room and\r\nraped her on the couch, next to her sister.  Then, he made the girls stay in the bathroom with\r\nhim while he took a shower.  He apologized to the girls for the rapes and murders.  He told\r\nthem that their mother had been trying to poison him and that her death was their fault.  Next,\r\nhe forced both girls to go with him into the garage, where he tried, unsuccessfully, to change\r\nthe license plate on his car.  He took the girls back to the living room, where he lifted the\r\ncomforter and showed the girls their brothers' bodies.  He remarked that Raekwon was\r\nstronger than he had expected him to be.  Appellant made the girls walk into their mother's\r\nbedroom and kiss her face, and then he put them into the bedroom closet.  He started a CD\r\nplayer and told them that help would come when the music ended.  He then locked the closet\r\ndoor and moved a dresser in front of it.  Finally, appellant left the house.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant drove to his mother's house to borrow her car.  He then drove to the home\r\nof his former girlfriend, Shunta Alexander, and their teenaged daughter, Brianna.  He told\r\nShunta what he had done.  He gave her some money for Brianna and remarked that if there\r\nwas a reward for catching him, Brianna should have it.  Shunta begged him to call the police. \r\nAppellant called the police on his cell phone and briefly reported that he had killed his wife\r\nand two boys and he had left two girls locked in a bedroom closet.  He provided the address\r\nand stated that he knew the police would trace the call if he stayed on the phone too long. \r\nHe then hung up, broke his cell phone, and left Shunta's home.  Later that morning,\r\nappellant's cousin drove him to the Greyhound bus station, where he bought a bus ticket\r\nunder an assumed name and traveled to Austin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant returned to Dallas a few days later.  He called a police detective and asked\r\nhim if the police had found an audiocassette tape he had left in the house, which he believed\r\ncontained a recording of Chare or one of the children admitting that they had been conspiring\r\nagainst him.  He thought that this tape would help his case.<sup> (5)</sup>  After his arrest, appellant made\r\na statement to police in which he requested testing for the presence of poison in his body, and\r\nhe said that LaKenya and Garysha should be polygraphed about whether Chare had been\r\npoisoning him.  He provided buccal, blood, hair, and fingernail samples to be tested for\r\nevidence of poisoning, but the lab that received the samples was not able to conduct the\r\nrequested tests, and investigators were unable to locate a lab with that capability.<sup> (6)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A. \tJury Voir Dire</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error one through seventeen, appellant complains that the trial court erred\r\nby denying the defense's challenges for cause to seventeen potential jurors.  The record\r\nshows that appellant used a peremptory strike to exclude each of the challenged potential\r\njurors.  He exhausted all of his peremptory strikes and was granted two additional peremptory\r\nstrikes.  After the trial court denied his request for a third additional peremptory strike,\r\nappellant identified an objectionable juror whom he was forced to accept.  Therefore,\r\nappellant preserved error.<sup> (7)</sup>  However, because the trial court granted him two additional\r\nperemptory strikes, appellant must show that the trial court committed error in denying his\r\nchallenges for cause to three potential jurors to demonstrate that he was harmed. <sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe look at the entire record of voir dire to determine if there is sufficient evidence\r\nto support the court's ruling on a challenge for cause.<sup> (9)</sup>  We give great deference to the trial\r\njudge's  decision because he is present to observe the venireman's demeanor and to listen to\r\nhis tone of voice.<sup> (10)</sup>  Particular deference is due when the potential juror's answers are\r\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory.<sup> (11)</sup>   In addition, \"[w]hen the record is confused, and\r\nwithout a clearly objectionable declaration by the venireman, . . . we must defer to the trial\r\ncourt's understanding of what actually occurred.\"<sup> (12)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA potential juror is challengeable for cause if he has a bias or prejudice against the\r\ndefendant or against the law upon which either the State or the defense is entitled to rely.<sup> (13)</sup> \r\n The test is whether the prospective juror's bias or prejudice would substantially impair his\r\nability to carry out his oath and instructions in accordance with the law.<sup> (14)</sup>  Before a\r\nprospective juror may be excused for cause on this basis, the law must be explained to him,\r\nand he must be asked whether he can follow that law, regardless of his personal views.<sup> (15)</sup>  To\r\nestablish that the challenge for cause is proper, the proponent of the challenge must show that\r\nthe prospective juror understood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his\r\nprejudice well enough to follow the law.<sup> (16)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tProspective jurors are not challengeable for their particular views about specific \r\nevidence.<sup> (17)</sup>  The law does not require a juror to consider a specifically enumerated type of\r\nevidence as either mitigating or aggravating.<sup> (18)</sup>  Therefore, a trial court does not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in overruling a defendant's challenge for cause based on a prospective juror's\r\nopinion that a particular type of evidence is not <em>per se</em> mitigating.<sup> (19)</sup>  Indeed, a trial court does\r\nnot abuse its discretion by disallowing questioning concerning a prospective juror's views\r\nabout the mitigating value of particular evidence.<sup> (20)</sup>  What is constitutionally required is that\r\njurors must not be precluded or prohibited from considering any relevant evidence offered\r\nin mitigation of punishment.<sup> (21)</sup>  This requirement is satisfied so long as a defendant is allowed\r\nto present relevant mitigating evidence and the jury is provided a vehicle to give mitigating\r\neffect to that evidence, if the jury finds it to be mitigating.<sup> (22)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's first point of error concerns prospective juror Lawrence Allen.  The\r\nrecord shows that, at the beginning of voir dire, Allen indicated that he generally favored the\r\ndeath penalty as an appropriate punishment for an intentional murder.  However, when he\r\nwas asked if, after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder, he could presume at the\r\nbeginning of the punishment phase that the answer to the future dangerousness question\r\nshould be negative, he replied that he would \"have no problem with that.\"  When Allen was\r\nasked if, after answering the future dangerousness question affirmatively, he could keep an\r\nopen mind concerning the mitigation question, he again stated that he would \"have no\r\nproblems with that.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel asked Allen if he thought that poverty would be a mitigating\r\ncircumstance, and Allen replied, \"Probably not.\"  Counsel then asked Allen whether he\r\nwould consider a mental defect to be mitigating.  Allen answered, \"I think I'd have to\r\nconsider that.  Any answer I give, it depends upon the circumstances taking place at the time\r\nof the trial, I think.\"  At the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Allen for\r\ncause on the ground that he was an \"automatic death penalty juror,\" in that he would always\r\nanswer the future dangerousness issue affirmatively and would not consider any mitigating\r\nfactors, particularly poverty.  The trial judge denied the challenge for cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  Regardless of his personal views,\r\nAllen affirmed that he could follow the law once it had been explained to him.  Additionally,\r\nhis statement that he did not think that poverty would be a mitigating circumstance did not\r\nmake him challengeable for cause.  Point of error one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's second point of error concerns prospective juror Anthony Stephenson. \r\nThe record reflects that the prosecutor explained to Stephenson that, if the defendant were\r\nfound guilty and they moved to the punishment phase, the jurors would have to presume that\r\nthe answer to the future dangerousness question would be no.  Stephenson stated that he\r\ncould make that presumption.  He also stated that he could keep an open mind concerning\r\nmitigation.  Later, defense counsel asked Stephenson whether, after he found a defendant\r\nguilty of a heinous capital murder, he would think that the defendant was a future danger. \r\nStephenson responded, \"Generally speaking, yes.\"  Counsel then asked, \"In that situation,\r\nwhen it comes to Special Issue Number 1 you're gonna always answer that in the way that\r\nwould be yes, if you found someone guilty of capital murder, that they would be a future\r\ndanger[]; is that right?\"  Stephenson responded, \"I would say yes.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the end of voir dire, counsel challenged Stephenson for cause on the ground that\r\nhe would always answer Special Issue Number 1, the future dangerousness special issue,\r\naffirmatively.  The State asked that Stephenson be brought back for clarification on that\r\npoint.  The trial court then brought Stephenson back and questioned him:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court: \tWhen [the prosecutor] was asking you questions, you understand that\r\nafter you found a defendant guilty of a capital offense, then you\r\nproceed into the punishment phase of the trial, or punishment part of\r\nthe trial?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson: \tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court: \tYou find out more evidence, and in going into that you would have to\r\nassume that the correct verdict before you heard anything from the state\r\nwould be that a life sentence would be the appropriate sentence in the\r\ncase.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\t Right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAnd then the state has to overcome that presumption, like the\r\npresumption of innocence, by proving to you beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that there is a probability that the defendant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.  Or be a continuing threat to\r\nsociety.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\t Right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\t Kind of predicting the future, so to speak.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAnd what is your opinion? . . . After having found-if you find him\r\nguilty, then can you presume the appropriate sentence is a life sentence\r\nuntil the state-and have the state prove to you beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt of the future-dangerousness issue . . . before you would invoke\r\nthe death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOr would you always, having found a person guilty of a heinous crime\r\nsuch as a capital-murder case, that you would always find [S]pecial\r\n[I]ssue [1] yes, because if he killed two or more it was so heinous that\r\nyou would always think that person would be a continuing threat to\r\nsociety?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tNo, I would not always think that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOkay.  So you could make the state do their job, assume that a life\r\nsentence was an appropriate sentence, and then make the state prove to\r\nyou, if they can, the future-dangerousness issue?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tOne other thing.  Are you telling me you would or would not\r\nautomatically find Special Issue Number 1, the answer to be yes?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYes is the one that invokes the death penalty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(Pause in proceedings)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tHave I confused you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tI have to say I would not always find yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tIn other words, you could follow the law and make them prove Special\r\nIssue Number 1 to you before you would make that finding of yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Stephenson:\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tChallenge for cause is denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYour honor, I have two things on the record.  I did forget about the\r\nmitigation.  He specifically indicated he would not consider poverty or\r\neducation as a mitigating factor.  We submit for cause on those, also.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Court:\tChallenge for cause is denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThis record shows that Stephenson arguably gave inconsistent answers concerning the\r\nfuture dangerousness question.  We afford particular deference to the trial court's\r\ndetermination that Stephenson was not challengeable for cause on this basis.  Further,\r\nStephenson was not challengeable for cause based on his statements that he did not think that\r\npoverty and education were mitigating.  Point of error two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fifth point of error concerns prospective juror William Triola.  The record\r\nreflects that, when the prosecutor explained the penalty phase and asked Triola whether, after\r\nfinding the defendant guilty, he could presume that the future dangerousness question should\r\nbe answered negatively, Triola affirmed that he could do so.  He stated that he would listen\r\nto all the evidence and keep an open mind before answering that question.  Concerning\r\nmitigation, Triola stated that he would consider how the defendant lived his life, and what\r\nthoughts or reasons might have driven him to commit the offense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel examined Triola about his written questionnaire.  In response to the\r\nquestion of whether some crimes, just because of their facts, called for the death penalty,\r\nTriola had written, \"Premeditated murder or murder[] of an innocent person in the\r\ncommission of a crime deserves the death penalty whether the [defendant] committed\r\nprevious acts or not.\"  When questioned about this response, Triola affirmed that that was\r\nhow he felt, and he stated that he believed that someone who committed a premeditated\r\nmurder \"pretty much\" deserved the death penalty.  However, he also explained that those\r\nwere his personal feelings, and he had not known about the applicable law and the penalty-\r\nphase questions until voir dire.  He stated that, until the prosecutor explained the penalty\r\nphase to him, he had believed that the jurors' job was done once they found a defendant\r\nguilty of premeditated or \"first degree\" murder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel asked Triola what he would want to know when he answered the\r\nspecial issues.  Triola said that he would want to know about the defendant's past to make\r\na decision concerning future dangerousness.  He stated that a defendant's history of violent\r\nbehavior for most of his adult life would indicate a probability that the defendant would\r\ncommit future acts of violence.  He also stated that he agreed with the presumption that a life\r\nsentence would be appropriate until the State proved future dangerousness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel explained that neither party had a burden of proof on the mitigation\r\nquestion.  He asked Triola what would be important to him in considering the mitigation\r\nspecial issue, and Triola answered that a sufficient mitigating circumstance could be \"almost\r\nanything.\"  He affirmed that he would keep an open mind and consider whatever evidence\r\nwas presented.  When counsel asked for examples, Triola answered, \"What might have\r\nhappened to the defendant in the past would be possibly mitigating circumstances.\"  Counsel\r\nasked him whether poverty or substance abuse would be mitigating circumstances.  Triola\r\nreplied that he did not think that they would be.  He believed that physical abuse and possibly\r\nmental-defect evidence could be mitigating, but he stated that he would have to hear the\r\nevidence before he could make a decision.  He stated that he would be open to testimony\r\nfrom a psychiatrist or psychologist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel then challenged Triola for cause on the ground that he was an\r\n\"automatic death penalty juror,\" who would always find future dangerousness and who stated\r\nthat someone who committed premeditated murder would deserve the death penalty\r\nregardless of any special issues on that point.  Counsel also challenged him as being\r\n\"mitigation-impaired\" because he did not consider poverty and substance abuse to be\r\nmitigating factors.  The prosecutor responded that Triola had stated that he would make the\r\npunishment decision based on the evidence and argument presented in the penalty phase, not\r\njust the facts of the offense, and that he had indicated he would listen to the evidence\r\npresented during each phase of the trial and give each step of the process due consideration. \r\nThe trial court denied the challenge for cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  Triola indicated that he could set aside\r\nhis personal feelings and follow the law concerning the special issues.  Triola's statements\r\nthat he did not think that poverty and substance abuse would be mitigating did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Point of error five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's sixth point of error concerns prospective juror Myrna Conde.  When\r\nquestioned by the State, Conde consistently affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty of\r\ncapital murder, she would keep an open mind and follow the law with respect to the future\r\ndangerousness and mitigation issues.  When questioned by defense counsel as to whether \r\nfinding the defendant guilty would cause her to favor the death penalty, she initially\r\nresponded, \"If it was presented that the defendant did commit the crime[,] that the severity\r\nof it was horrendous, the circumstances were premeditation, I believe that the State of Texas\r\ndoes impose the death penalty, I would be in favor of that.\"  She then indicated that she did\r\nnot mean to say that in such a case the State \"imposes\" the death penalty, but rather the State\r\nof Texas \"allows\" the death penalty.  Defense counsel asked Conde several times whether,\r\nafter finding the defendant guilty, she would presume that the defendant would be a future\r\ndanger, and each time Conde affirmed that she would answer the future dangerousness\r\nquestion affirmatively.  When counsel asked Conde if there was anything that she thought\r\nwould be mitigating or important to her, she stated that there was nothing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCounsel then challenged Conde for cause on the grounds that after having found\r\nsomeone guilty, she would always presume the defendant to be a future danger and she\r\nwould not consider anything to be mitigating.  The State responded that the way counsel had\r\nasked the questions had led Conde to give those answers.  The trial court then called Conde\r\nback for additional questioning.  The court again explained the phases of the trial and the law\r\napplicable to the punishment phase.  Conde indicated that, after finding the defendant guilty,\r\nshe would not presume that the future dangerousness question should be answered\r\naffirmatively, and she would keep an open mind and consider any mitigating circumstances. \r\nThe court then denied defense counsel's challenge for cause.  Counsel objected to the court's\r\nrehabilitation of Conde and re-urged his challenge for cause, which was again denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Conde vacillated depending on who was asking the questions. \r\nWhen the law was explained to her, she affirmed that she would follow the law.  In this\r\nsituation, we afford particular deference to the trial court's determination.<sup> (23)</sup>  Point of error\r\nsix is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's seventh point of error concerns prospective juror Peter Cavazos.  At the\r\nconclusion of voir dire, appellant challenged Cavazos on the ground that he would always\r\nanswer the mitigation special issue in a way that the death penalty would result because he\r\nwould not consider poverty or substance abuse to be mitigating factors.  Cavazos's\r\nstatements that particular types of evidence were not mitigating to him did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.<sup> (24)</sup>  Point of error seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's eighth point of error concerns prospective juror Patrick Norton.  Norton\r\nopined that, in general, the death penalty would be a just penalty for any murder.  However,\r\nwhen questioned by the prosecutor, he affirmed that he would keep an open mind and follow\r\nthe law concerning the future dangerousness and mitigation issues.  When defense counsel\r\nquestioned Norton about his written responses to the jury questionnaire, he stated that his\r\nown feelings were that if someone takes a life, his own life ought to be taken.  However,\r\nNorton affirmed that, after the law had been explained to him, he would follow the law and\r\nnot prejudge the case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNorton also stated that he would consider mitigating circumstances.  He\r\nacknowledged that he had written on his questionnaire that background was \"not an excuse\"\r\nin assessing punishment, but he affirmed that, after he was made aware of the context for that\r\nquestion, he could \"probably\" take into consideration anything that would \"be leading up to\r\nwhy [the defendant was] doing this crime.\"  When counsel asked Norton whether he would\r\nconsider poverty and education to be mitigating, Norton responded that they were not\r\nmitigating.  Counsel also asked Norton whether he would consider a mental defect to be\r\nmitigating.  Norton first stated that he was not sure, and then later he indicated that a mental\r\ndefect would not be sufficiently mitigating.  Defense counsel challenged Norton for cause\r\non the grounds that he would always answer the future dangerousness question affirmatively\r\nafter finding the defendant guilty, and he would not give any meaningful consideration to any\r\nmitigating factor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConcerning future dangerousness, the record shows that Norton stated that he could\r\nset aside his personal views and follow the law.  Concerning mitigation, Norton's statements\r\nthat particular types of evidence were not mitigating to him did not render him challengeable\r\nfor cause.<sup> (25)</sup>  Point of error eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's ninth point of error concerns prospective juror Harold Wheeler.  The\r\nrecord shows that, after the prosecutor explained the law concerning the special issues,\r\nWheeler indicated that he would keep an open mind and follow the law.  He said that he\r\nwould presume a negative answer to the future dangerousness question until the State proved\r\notherwise.  The prosecutor pointed out that Wheeler had given a written response on the jury\r\nquestionnaire, stating that mitigation is \"never an issue\" in a murder case.  However, after\r\nthe prosecutor explained the mitigation issue, Wheeler again confirmed that he would follow\r\nthe law and keep an open mind.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the defense's examination, Wheeler was somewhat less sure of his ability to\r\nset the defendant's guilt aside when considering the future dangerousness issue, but he\r\ncontinued to maintain that he would not always answer the future dangerousness question\r\naffirmatively, and that he would keep an open mind.  Concerning the mitigation issue,\r\nWheeler reiterated that he had not understood the law when he filled out the jury\r\nquestionnaire, but he now understood the law and could consider mitigating evidence.  When\r\ncounsel questioned him about particular types of mitigating evidence, Wheeler stated that he\r\nwas willing to consider mental illness as a mitigating factor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of voir dire, counsel challenged Wheeler on the ground that he\r\nequivocated on the future dangerousness issue, was inclined to answer it affirmatively, and\r\nwould not presume a negative answer, which effectively lessened the State's burden to prove\r\nfuture dangerousness.  Counsel also challenged Wheeler on the ground that he would be\r\nunable to give fair consideration to mitigation, based on his written questionnaire answer that\r\nhe did not think mitigation was appropriate in a murder case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, we find no abuse of discretion.  After the law pertaining to the future\r\ndangerousness question had been explained to him, Wheeler indicated that he would set aside\r\nhis personal feelings and follow the law.  Although Wheeler wrote on his juror questionnaire\r\nthat mitigation was \"never an issue,\" after the law was explained to him, he affirmed that he\r\nwould follow the law and consider mitigating evidence.  Point of error nine is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's tenth point of error concerns prospective juror Stacy Chadwick.  The\r\nrecord reflects that at the beginning of voir dire, Chadwick indicated that she generally\r\nfavored the death penalty.  She stated that she did not have any problem with assessing the\r\ndeath penalty because, in her view, someone who made the decision to take the lives of\r\nothers \"brought [the death sentence] upon himself.\"  However, after the prosecutor explained\r\nthe penalty phase and the special issues to her, Chadwick indicated that she could presume\r\nthat the appropriate sentence would be life without parole until the State proved the\r\ndefendant's future dangerousness to her.  Concerning mitigation, she stated that she could\r\nkeep an open mind.  She indicated that drug use would not be \"an excuse\" for committing\r\nan offense.  She acknowledged that after finding a defendant guilty and also answering the\r\nfuture dangerousness issue affirmatively, she would have to see \"something massive\" to\r\ncause her to find sufficient mitigation in order to change the death sentence to life.  She\r\nagreed, however, to listen to the evidence and keep an open mind.  Her answers during the\r\ndefense's examination were consistent with these responses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Chadwick on several\r\ngrounds: she was death-prone and would \"equate finding of guilty with the result of death\";\r\nafter an hour and a half of explaining, she still did not \"seem to fully understand or appreciate\r\nthe mitigation scheme put in place by the legislature\"; and she would not properly consider\r\nthe mitigation question.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record does not support appellant's assertion that Chadwick would \"equate\"\r\nfinding guilt with a death sentence.  Chadwick initially said that someone who killed\r\nsomeone else had brought the death penalty upon himself, but after the law was explained\r\nto her, she affirmed that she would set aside her personal feelings and follow the law\r\nconcerning future dangerousness.  Nor does the record support appellant's assertions that\r\nChadwick did not understand or appreciate the mitigation scheme and would not properly\r\nconsider mitigation.  Chadwick's statements that drug use was \"not an excuse\" and that she\r\nwould have to see \"something massive\" in order to find sufficient mitigation did not render\r\nher challengeable for cause.<sup> (26)</sup>   Point of error ten is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's eleventh point of error concerns prospective juror Phillip Magee.  Magee\r\nexpressed the view that he did not think that poverty \"in and of itself\" could be sufficiently\r\nmitigating.  He also stated that he did not think that mental illness \"by itself\" would be\r\nmitigating.  At the conclusion of voir dire, counsel challenged Magee, asserting that he was\r\n\"mitigation impaired\" because he could not consider defendant's specific mitigators,\r\nspecifically poverty and mental illness.  However, Magee's statements that he did not think\r\nparticular types of evidence were mitigating \"by themselves\" did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.<sup> (27)</sup>  Point of error eleven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's twelfth point of error concerns prospective juror Catherine Roberts.  The\r\nrecord shows that, at the beginning of voir dire, Roberts indicated that she generally favored\r\nthe death penalty.  When the prosecutor explained the punishment phase to her, she said that\r\nshe would keep an open mind at punishment and make the State prove future dangerousness. \r\nShe also affirmed that she could keep an open mind concerning mitigation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRoberts's answers to defense counsel's questions were generally consistent with her\r\nanswers to the prosecutor's questions.  When defense counsel asked Roberts whether she\r\nthought that poverty or education would be sufficiently mitigating, she responded that they\r\nwould not.  When counsel asked her whether mental illness, child abuse, and spousal abuse\r\nwould be sufficiently mitigating, Roberts answered that they could be, \"depending on all the\r\nevidence.\"  Defense counsel then challenged Roberts on the grounds that she would not be\r\nable to \"presume a life sentence\" and that she was mitigation-impaired because she would\r\nnot consider poverty and education as mitigating factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record does not support appellant's assertion that Roberts would be unable to\r\npresume that a life sentence would be appropriate after she found appellant guilty but before\r\nshe heard the evidence at the penalty phase.  When the law was explained to her, Roberts\r\naffirmed that she would make the State prove future dangerousness.  Roberts's views as to\r\nwhether particular types of evidence would be sufficiently mitigating did not render her\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Point of error twelve is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's thirteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Billy Esparza.  At the\r\nbeginning of voir dire, Esparza indicated that he generally favored the death penalty.  When\r\nthe prosecutor explained the punishment phase and the special issues to him, he indicated that\r\nhe would presume that a sentence of life without parole would be appropriate until the State\r\nproved the defendant's future dangerousness.  Initially, Esparza did not see a difference\r\nbetween the terms \"possibility\" and \"probability,\" but he indicated that he understood the\r\ndifference after the prosecutor explained it to him.  Esparza affirmed that he would keep an\r\nopen mind and listen to all the evidence before he decided the mitigation issue.  He stated\r\nthat he did not think that substance abuse, poverty, or education would be mitigating, but he\r\nsaid that he would keep an open mind and listen to all the evidence before making a decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen defense counsel asked Esparza about the distinction between probability and\r\npossibility, Esparza hesitated to give a direct answer.  However, Esparza eventually affirmed\r\nthat the term \"probability\" signified something more than \"possibility\":</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tLet me talk about one other thing. . . . The prosecutor talked to you about the\r\ndefinition of \"probability.\" Do you remember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tWhat was your definition of \"probability?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tI think I said 50/50.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tOne of the things that concerned me, you said possibility and probability were\r\nthe same thing.  You remember that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tI don't think I said they were the same thing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tTell me, you see the difference between probability and possibility?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tHow could they be the same?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tNo, the difference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tThe difference?  I don't know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tYou understand the law says that it's a probability?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tThere are no definitions for these words. . . . I submit there's a definite\r\ndistinction between probability and possibility[.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes, okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tDo you see any distinction after the prosecutor went over it with you and\r\ntalked about more than a mere possibility as far as definition of \"probability\"? \r\nDo you understand that?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \tDo you have any questions for me, Mr. Esparza?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \tNo, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>At the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel challenged Esparza on the grounds that he\r\nwas mitigation-impaired in that he was unable to consider poverty or education as a\r\nmitigating factor.  Counsel also challenged Esparza on the ground that he had \"a problem\r\n[with] the definitions of 'possible' and 'probable.'\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEsparza's views that poverty and education were not mitigating did not render him\r\nchallengeable for cause.  Although he expressed some initial confusion concerning the\r\ndistinction between \"probability\" and \"possibility,\" he understood and accepted the\r\ndistinction once it had been explained to him.  Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the challenge for cause.<sup> (28)</sup>  Point of error thirteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fourteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Michael Davis. \r\nDuring the State's examination, Davis said that he could keep an open mind and consider all\r\nthe evidence in answering the future dangerousness and mitigation questions.  During the\r\ndefense's examination, counsel asked Davis what the result would be if he found the\r\ndefendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness question affirmatively.  Davis\r\nreplied, \"[P]robably the death penalty.\"  Counsel asked Davis if his mind would be made up\r\nat that point, and he agreed that it would be.  However, Davis then said that the death penalty\r\nshould be invoked at that point \"unless there's just mitigating circumstances to sway me the\r\nother way.\"  Counsel asked Davis, if he found defendant guilty and a future danger, \"[N]ow\r\ncan you go forward and look at that [mitigating evidence] and unring the bell?\"  Davis\r\nanswered, \"Yes.\"  But then, when counsel asked, \"There isn't anything you would ever\r\nconsider to be mitigating to unring that bell, so to speak?\"  Davis responded, \"Uh, yeah.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court questioned Davis in order to clarify his responses.  During this questioning,\r\nDavis indicated that after he found a defendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness\r\nquestion affirmatively, the result would be a death sentence if he did not find sufficiently\r\nmitigating evidence, but a life sentence if he found sufficient mitigation.  At the conclusion\r\nof voir dire, counsel challenged Davis on the grounds that he was \"mitigation-impaired,\" and\r\nthat once he found the defendant guilty and answered the future dangerousness question\r\naffirmatively, he would not consider mitigating factors.  Counsel also asserted that after\r\nfinding the defendant guilty, Davis would always find the defendant to be a future danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Davis gave inconsistent answers with regard to whether he\r\nwould consider mitigating evidence, but he affirmed on several occasions that he would\r\nfollow the law and consider mitigating evidence.  Appellant's assertion that Davis would\r\nalways find the defendant to be a future danger is not supported by the record.  We afford\r\nparticular deference to the trial court's determination that Davis was not challengeable for\r\ncause.<sup> (29)</sup>  Point of error fourteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's fifteenth point of error concerns prospective juror John Reeves.  In\r\naddition to setting out the grounds for defense counsel's challenge to Reeves, appellant\r\n\"submits that the use of the phrase 'trips up juror[s]' by the State influenced this juror's\r\nanswers in that it made him aware of how he needed to answer the question of future\r\ndangerousness to be qualified as a juror rather than expressing his true feelings concerning\r\nthe death penalty.\"  We understand appellant to mean that the prosecutor's use of this phrase\r\nimpeded the defense's ability to develop a challenge for cause by discouraging Reeves from\r\nanswering defense counsel's questions candidly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring voir dire, the prosecutor discussed the law applicable to the guilt phase, and\r\nthen explained that, if the jurors found the defendant guilty, they would be given two\r\nquestions at the punishment phase.  The prosecutor explained that, after finding the defendant\r\nguilty and before hearing any evidence at the punishment phase, the jury would have to\r\npresume that life in prison would be the appropriate punishment.  Reeves stated that he\r\nwould keep an open mind in answering the future dangerousness question and not\r\nautomatically assume that the defendant would be a future danger.  The prosecutor then\r\ncontinued:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol type=\"A\">\r\n  <li><span>\tI'm gonna go back here.  Never fails, once I have no further questions\r\nfor you and [defense counsel] gets to ask you questions, he always trips\r\nup jurors on this.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAt the point you have found someone guilty.  Think where we\r\nare on this.  The point you have actually found him guilty.  And you\r\nfound him guilty of a horrendous, horrible murder, multiple people,\r\nwith no justification, not an accident, not self-defense; [he's] not\r\ndefending a third person; he's not insane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWhat are your thoughts on the death penalty at that point?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI certainly would be leaning in that direction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tOkay.  Now, I think that's normal.  That's where he trips 'em up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYour honor, I object to comments on counsel as far as --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tThey just have different points of view when they ask you questions,\r\nMr.-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWhy should I get tripped up?  Why should I be any different?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYour opinions are fine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAt this point, as a juror, though, you haven't heard punishment\r\nevidence yet.  So you, as a juror, cannot be leaning towards the death\r\npenalty.  In fact, just the opposite; you have to be leaning towards life\r\nuntil the state proves to you it should be death.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tYou see what I mean?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tYes.  I assume you're saying you almost-if you can, you're almost\r\nwiping the slate almost clean to proceed to the next basic trial part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tUntil you can hear everything.  Then you can consider the fact that you\r\nfound him guilty.  You can't automatically lean towards death.  The law\r\nwants you to listen to everything.  May be something in his background.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI took your question to mean: If that's all there was at that point, what\r\nwould your feelings be?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tI can tell you that if the state weren't seeking the death penalty and you\r\nfound someone guilty of the same crime it's an automatic life sentence. \r\nMaybe it's easier to think in terms of that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tThat's probably a better way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tAt the point you found him guilty, that's a life sentence, okay?  That's\r\na life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tNow, if the state puts on evidence . . . that convinces you beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that he's probably gonna continue being a danger,\r\neven in prison, at that point you get to change that to a death sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tDoes that - </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tMakes more sense, yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tIf I come back and ask you again: At the point you just found him\r\nguilty, as a juror, what are you thinking?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tAs a juror.  Right now I'm at life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tSo you-you know, it is a mental exercise.  What it really comes down\r\nto, is it a mental exercise that you feel you can give more than lip\r\nservice, that you could actually do as a juror?  Or would you have\r\nfeelings you really would be leaning towards a death sentence,\r\nhonestly, and it may not be something you could actually give more\r\nthan lip service to?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I could do the right way, as you explained.  I think not knowing\r\nanything about the procedure before coming here, not knowing what\r\nthe circumstances were with regards to the death penalty and that type\r\nthing-regardless what my answers were, I didn't know.  And I said, just\r\na layman, we would think a horrendous crime, you would lean.  Now\r\nyou explained there's two procedures and the proper way to do it.  But\r\njust coming in here, I would [lean toward the death penalty].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tObviously, it would be unfair to get into the facts at this point, try to\r\ncommit you one way or the other.  I can, however, assure you it's\r\ncapital murder.  It's gonna be a horrific crime, no matter which way you\r\nlook at it, by the nature of the crime. . . . The law says you still go with\r\nthat automatic assumption it's a life sentence unless you hear something\r\nin either phase of the trial that convinces you he's gonna be a\r\ncontinuing danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tSo you're telling me, \"If the law requires that of me, I can d[o]\r\nit\"?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tOr, \"I think I can do it\"?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI can do it, yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor then discussed the mitigation issue, and Reeves said that he would\r\ngive it fair consideration if the jury reached that question after finding the defendant guilty\r\nand finding that the defendant would be a future danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel remarked on the prosecutor's use of the words, \"trips 'em up\" during\r\nhis examination of Reeves:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou know, it's funny.  [The prosecutor] used the words \"tripped you up.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tI want to use words they use: \"follow the law,\" \"be fair and impartial.\" \r\nThose are all words that I think sometimes, even the judge points out, it makes\r\nsomeone answer in a way they think they're supposed to answer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIf I came up and said, \"Mr. Reeves, this is the law.  You can follow the\r\nlaw, can't you,\" that implies that the answer is yes and it's harder to say no in\r\nthat situation.  That's what the judge was talking about when he talked to you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAll we want is honest answers here.  There are laws that people\r\ndisagree with.  And if that's the situation, we need to know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou understand that if you find someone guilty, you go forward to the\r\npunishment stage.  The first special issue, the future issue-the future-dangerousness issue, if it's determined beyond a reasonable doubt the\r\nindividual will probably be a continuing threat to society, then you answer yes. \r\nThen if that answer is yes, you proceed to Special Issue Number 2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIf the answer's no, you know what happens?  He's not a future danger.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tIt's automatic life in prison.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tExactly.  I'm not trying to trip you up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI always slow up on your answers.  I have been warned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tAnd we're gonna get back to the question that she said that I was trying to trip\r\npeople up on here in a minute.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tYou look at the mitigating circumstance or circumstances that would\r\nwarrant a life sentence without possibility of parole.  If the answer's yes,\r\nthere's mitigating circumstances, then what happens?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tLife sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tRight, exactly.  I'm not trying to-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI'm processing your question.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tIf the answer's no, there aren't any mitigating circumstances?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tIt's the death penalty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tSure.  All right.  So what I want to look at is put you in a hypothetical.  You\r\nanswered this originally one way with the prosecutor.  She had used the words\r\n\"tripped up.\"  It's not.  It's the natural tendency of people.  If that's the way\r\nsomeone leans, one way or another, that's what we need to know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tSure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tThe hypothetical gets to this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIf you're on a jury, hypothetically, you and 11 other individuals find\r\nsomeone guilty of capital murder.  As the prosecutor explained to you, it's\r\ngonna be a heinous crime.  It's a capital murder.  You can imagine it's horrific. \r\nPerson intended to commit the crime, meant to kill two people.  Wasn't self-defense[;] wasn't defense of another person; individual wasn't insane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAs the prosecutor said, at that point what are your thoughts on the death\r\npenalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWe have already decided?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou have determined he's guilty of capital murder.  See I used it four times,\r\nbut it's tripped up-but people are-if you found someone guilty, people\r\ntypically say, \"You know what?  The death penalty.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think not knowing what I know now, you assume that's what you would think\r\nin a death-penalty case.  Been explained a little differently to me.  The real\r\nquestion is can I change my thinking, in the second phase.  I feel I can.  My\r\nanswer is quite honest.  Coming in here, that's my normal reaction. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tThat's what I want to get to.  When the rubber hits the road, can you do it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tA lot of people said, \"I might be able to.\"  I give the example like\r\ngetting on a plane flying to Austin and the pilot says, \"I think I can get us\r\nthere.  I might be able to.\"  You don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling at that point\r\nand might be heading for the exit door.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tThat's where it's difficult; can someone really do that?  The prosecutor\r\nused the words of a \"mental exercise.\"  It's more than that.  It's really looking\r\nintrospectively at yourself: \"Can I do this?  Setting aside my initial reaction,\r\nwhich is leaning towards the death penalty or something, that you know what? \r\nI'm probably gonna get in there and will probably lean towards that side.  I\r\nknow the law tells me to do one thing.  I'm supposed to presume life.  I don't\r\nknow if I can.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tPush comes to shove, that's what I'm trying to find out.  It extends to\r\nthe next question.  Tell me your thoughts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I'm on board with the special issue question so I think that helps me in\r\nseparating myself from the guilty to the punishment phase.  The second board\r\nup there with the special issue, that helps me say yes, I'm able to do it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tYou used a couple [of] terms that perk my ears up: \"I think I can,\" \"I can\r\nprobably.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tWell, it's a tough one.  This is all new to me of-I'm not there.  You are.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q. \t\tI understand.  That's the dilemma people get in with the answers. \r\nUnfortunately, the law requires yes-or-no answers.  I'm not saying-I told you\r\nthe law.  Someone's supposed to, but the question is, can you do that?  If you\r\ncan, that's fine.  If you can't, I need to know i[t].  Unfortunately, can't accept\r\n\"I think\" or \"probably.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \t\tI think I can.  I know I can do it.  I can do this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tReeves continued to agree that he could follow the law concerning future\r\ndangerousness.  He also stated that he would consider mitigating circumstances.  When\r\ndefense counsel questioned him about specific types of potentially mitigating evidence,\r\nReeves indicated that he would consider poverty and education \"to a small degree\" as\r\nmitigating factors, and he would consider mental illness to a greater degree.  Counsel then\r\nchallenged Reeves for cause on the grounds that he would be leaning towards death and\r\nwould always find future dangerousness after finding the defendant guilty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record reflects that, once the law was explained to him, Reeves agreed that he\r\ncould set aside his personal feelings and follow the law, and he would not automatically lean\r\ntoward the death penalty.  In addition, the record does not support appellant's assertion that\r\nReeves would always find future dangerousness after finding the defendant guilty.  Point of\r\nerror fifteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's sixteenth point of error concerns prospective juror Ronald Jarvis.  Counsel\r\nchallenged Jarvis on the ground that he was \"mitigation impaired\" and would not consider\r\npoverty as a mitigating factor.  The record shows that Jarvis indicated that he would place\r\nthe burden on the defense to show sufficiently mitigating evidence, and he did not consider\r\npoverty to be a mitigating factor.  Neither of these facts rendered him challengeable for\r\ncause.<sup> (30)</sup>  Point of error sixteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's seventeenth point of error concerns prospective juror Susan Cassel.  He\r\ncontends that Cassel was challengeable for cause under Article 35.16(a)(5), which provides\r\nthat a challenge for cause may be made by either the state or the defense for the reason that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>the juror has such defect in the organs of feeling or hearing, or such bodily or\r\nmental defect or disease as to render the juror unfit for jury service, or that the\r\njuror is legally blind and the court in its discretion is not satisfied that the juror\r\nis fit for jury service in that particular case[.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A \"mental defect\" may be present when the prospective juror's responses show an inability\r\nto understand the jury's role in capital proceedings.<sup> (31)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring voir dire, Cassel said that she understood and would follow the law concerning\r\nthe State's burden of proof at the guilt phase.  She also stated that after finding a defendant\r\nguilty, she could presume that a life sentence was the proper punishment.  She affirmed that\r\nshe could presume that the defendant would not be a future danger, unless and until the State\r\nproved future dangerousness during the punishment phase.  Cassel also said that she would\r\nbe open to considering mitigating circumstances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNear the conclusion of voir dire, defense counsel asked Cassel if she had any\r\nquestions for him.  Cassel asked for clarification about the timing of the different parts of the\r\ntrial.  Counsel explained that the guilt phase would come first, and then, if the jury found the\r\ndefendant guilty, the punishment phase would follow.  During punishment, the jury would\r\nhear evidence concerning both future dangerousness and mitigation, all at the same time. \r\nThe jury would then retire to deliberate on the future dangerousness question and then, if the\r\njury found that the defendant was a future danger, the jury would deliberate on the mitigation\r\nquestion.  Cassel thanked defense counsel for this information.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCounsel then challenged Cassel for cause, asserting,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJudge, at this time we spent over an hour and a half speaking to this\r\njuror.  It's clear she does not have the mental capacity to fully understand the\r\nnature of the issues before her and we do not feel that-I mean, we have had to\r\ngo back and cover these things in depth on every point that applies and she's\r\nbeen very-wavered back and forth as far as whether or not she has an\r\nunderstanding what's being asked as well as an appreciation of the issues\r\ninvolved.  We feel that her inability to understand the issues, to understand- </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI'm talking to her about the special issues in punishment and she's\r\ngoing back asking how the trial works.  That's not the kind of juror that the\r\nlaw envision[s] sitting on this type of case. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe would challenge the juror for cause for a lack of appreciation and\r\nunderstanding of the process and we would ask the court to excuse this juror\r\nfor cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The trial court responded, \"I'm not sure, Mr. Johnson, whether you and I just observed the\r\nsame juror [for] an hour and a half.  Be that as it may, your motion that she be stricken for\r\ncause is denied.\"  Counsel then requested an additional peremptory strike, which was denied,\r\nand he identified Cassel as an objectionable juror.  Cassel was seated as the twelfth juror.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis record does not demonstrate that Cassel had any bodily or mental defect that\r\nrendered her unfit for jury service.  The record shows only that, when defense counsel asked\r\nCassel if she had any questions, she asked him for clarification about the timing of the\r\ndifferent parts of the trial.  Counsel answered her question, and she thanked him.  The trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's challenge for cause.  Point of error\r\nseventeen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause appellant must show that the trial court erred by denying his challenges for\r\ncause to three prospective jurors, we need not consider his third and fourth points of error,<sup> (32)</sup>\r\nand they are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error eighteen and nineteen, appellant asserts that, as a result of the errors\r\nalleged in points one through seventeen, the jury as constituted was biased or prejudiced, thus\r\ndepriving appellant of a fair trial in violation of the United States Constitution and the Texas\r\nConstitution.<sup> (33)</sup>  We have found no error with respect to appellant's individual jury selection points of error,\r\nand so these points, complaining of cumulative error, are also without merit.  Points of error\r\neighteen and nineteen are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B. \tMotion for Separate Juries</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twentieth point of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying\r\nhis pretrial motion to impanel separate juries for the guilt phase and the penalty phase. \r\nAppellant urges that the effect of the death-qualification process on appellant's jury violated\r\nhis right to a fair trial \"as embodied in the concepts of equal protection [and] due process\r\nunder both the Texas and United States Constitution[s].\"<sup> (34)</sup>  He cites to social-science studies\r\nreporting that death-qualified jurors are more conviction-prone and more likely to believe\r\nthat the law favors the death penalty as an appropriate punishment than jurors who have not\r\ngone through the death-qualification process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Supreme Court has rejected similar claims that relied, in part, on\r\nthe same social studies cited by appellant.<sup> (35)</sup>  After identifying \"some of the more serious\r\nproblems\" with those studies, the Supreme Court held that, even if those studies established\r\nthat the death-qualification process does in fact produce juries that are somewhat more\r\nconviction-prone, \"the Constitution does not prohibit the States from 'death qualifying' juries\r\nin capital cases.\"<sup> (36)</sup>  This Court has also rejected the argument that the death-qualification\r\nprocess unconstitutionally influences jurors to favor the death penalty.<sup> (37)</sup>  Furthermore, there\r\nis no constitutional impediment to a determination of sentence by the same jury that\r\ndetermined guilt.<sup> (38)</sup>  Point of error twenty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C. \tSpecial Issues Not Charged in Indictment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-first point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred by denying\r\nhis pretrial motion to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option because the\r\nindictment did not include notice of the penalty-phase special issues, and these issues are\r\nelements of the offense that must be pleaded in the indictment.  He acknowledges that we\r\nhave rejected similar claims.<sup> (39)</sup>  We are not persuaded to reconsider our prior decisions.  Point\r\nof error twenty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tSpectator Outburst at the Punishment Phase</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts in his twenty-second point of error that the trial court committed\r\nerror by not declaring a mistrial after a spectator caused a disturbance in the presence of the\r\njury.  He argues that the disturbance was an external influence on the jurors, and that the trial\r\ncourt's refusal to grant a mistrial violated his constitutional right to be tried by impartial\r\njurors whose verdict is based solely on the evidence at trial.  He further asserts that the\r\nspectator's conduct was \"designed to deny appellant a fair trial.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's denial of a request for a mistrial is reviewed under an abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard.<sup> (40)</sup>  An appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe trial court's ruling, considering only those arguments before the court at the time of the\r\nruling.<sup> (41)</sup>  The ruling must be upheld if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement.<sup> (42)</sup> \r\n A mistrial is an extreme remedy that should be granted \"only when residual prejudice\r\nremains\" after less drastic alternatives have been explored.<sup> (43)</sup>  When the party requesting a\r\nmistrial does not first request a lesser remedy, we will not reverse the court's judgment if the\r\nproblem could have been cured by a less drastic alternative.<sup> (44)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSpectator conduct that impedes normal trial proceedings will not result in reversible\r\nerror unless the defendant shows a reasonable probability that the conduct interfered with the\r\njury's verdict.<sup> (45)</sup>  Injury to a defendant is measured on a case-by-case basis.<sup> (46)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the record shows that, during the prosecutor's closing argument at the\r\npunishment phase, the proceedings were interrupted when a man rushed toward a break in\r\nthe rail that separated the spectators from the \"attorney-accessible-only area\" of the\r\ncourtroom.  The prosecutor had been arguing that mercy was not appropriate in this case:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe know Robert Sparks' background, how he grew up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYou know, Robert Sparks' mom came and testified yesterday and she\r\ntestified that Robert was two or three years old and would wake up in the\r\nmiddle of the night.  She did what a parent's supposed to do.  She . . . gave him\r\nwater or gave him milk and gave him love, because that's what an adult's\r\nsupposed to do with a young child when they're scared in the night or wake up\r\nin the night.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWhat did little Troy<sup>[</sup><sup> (47)</sup><sup>]</sup> get from this man when the tears start[ed]\r\ncoming out of his eyes as Robert stuck that knife into him over and over again? \r\nYou know what little Troy got?

Took a short break.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYour Honor, at this time the defense is gonna move for a mistrial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tLike to at this time make a bystander's bill and would call a witness to\r\ntestify in regards to the actions.  This is the second time this individual has\r\ndisrupted the court proceedings during portions of the descriptions of the\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd if the court will allow, I'll make an offer of proof it's my\r\nunderstanding this is the same individual that during testimony in the guilt/\r\ninnocence phase of the trial, jumped up, started yelling and had to be escorted\r\nout of the courtroom by the prosecution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWe objected at that time.  The court-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tThis case?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tYes.  In fact, the court told members of the jury [sic; audience] if there was any\r\nmore outbursts in regards to testimony, they would be barred from the\r\ncourtroom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter an off-the-record discussion at the bench, appellant's counsel continued:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense: \tJudge, there's been discussion at sidebar in regards to the exact timing of when\r\nthis-the exact events occurred.  There was an outburst in the testimony of the\r\nguilt/innocence phase, and due to that outburst, my recollection, the court was\r\ngoing to excuse the jury to admonish the jury-or admonish the audience any\r\nfurther outbursts would result in any individuals being barred from further\r\nadmittance into the courtroom, which time the jury was standing up at-the\r\nprosecutor Heath Harris was required to get up and take Harold Sublet, Sr.,\r\nand escort him out of the courtroom because he again approached the rail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tIt's my recollection, Judge, and I believe it to be accurate, and would\r\ncall Heath Harris to testify.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tAfter arguments you can make your bill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tWhat's your motion?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Defense:\tJust let the record to reflect that now, in the conclusion or portion of [the\r\nprosecutor's] argument in regards to the infliction of wounds on Harold Sublet,\r\nSr.-Jr., this same individual's now rushed the jury rail in front of the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tWe believe this type of thing has prejudiced the defendant in the eyes\r\nof the jury.  This individual again has been escorted out of the courtroom by\r\nthe prosecutor Heath Harris, as well as several members of the bailiff[']s staff. \r\nWe believe that. . . in the jury's eyes we have been prejudiced and ask the\r\ncourt to grant a mistrial at this time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tAll right. [A]ny response?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor:\tAsk the court to deny the motion.  The jury doesn't know who this fella is,\r\nwho he's related to.  They can draw their own conclusion and has got nothing\r\nto do with their deliberations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Court:\tI'm gonna deny your motion for mistrial.  So the record's clear, I'll give each\r\nside a chance to supplement the record later with their recollection of prior\r\noccurrences.<sup>[</sup><sup> (48)</sup><sup>]</sup>  Mine's a little different than [defense counsel's].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The court admonished the members of the audience that any further outbursts would result\r\nin the person who caused the outburst being jailed and held in contempt.  The jury was then\r\nescorted back into the courtroom, and the prosecutor continued his closing argument without\r\nfurther interruption.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the past, we have found that an emotional outburst from members of the victim's\r\nfamily was not harmful when the outburst was non-verbal and the jury was immediately\r\nremoved from the courtroom.<sup> (49)</sup>   In <em>Landry,</em> the decedent's family members testified during\r\nthe trial with such emotion that the court recessed at several points in order to allow them to\r\nregain their composure before continuing.<sup> (50)</sup>  Later, during the defendant's closing argument,\r\nthe decedent's widow and brother caused a commotion in the audience, and the judge retired\r\nthe jury.<sup> (51)</sup>  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, noting for the record that he had been\r\ninterrupted by an emotional outburst from the decedent's widow, who \"was in the process\r\nof fainting and leaving the courtroom,\" and also by an outcry from the decedent's brother that\r\nwas loud enough to be heard near the jury rail.<sup> (52)</sup>  Finding it significant that these outbursts\r\ndid not involve any verbal outcries and that the jury was immediately removed from the\r\ncourtroom, we held that appellant had failed to demonstrate how these emotional responses\r\nreasonably could have interfered with the jury's verdict.<sup> (53)</sup></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMore recently, we held that a spectator's verbal, emotional outburst did not require\r\na mistrial.  In <em>Gamboa,</em> during a State's witness's testimony, a family member of the murder\r\nvictim shouted, \"You did this for 200 dollars?\"<sup> (54)</sup>  We determined that the trial court's\r\nstatement to the jury that the outburst was made by someone who was not a witness and not\r\nunder oath, coupled with the court's instruction to disregard what was said, was sufficient\r\nto cure the impropriety.<sup> (55)</sup>  We held that nothing in the record suggested that the outburst was\r\nof such a nature that the jury could not ignore it and fairly examine the evidence in arriving\r\nat a verdict.<sup> (56)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, Harold Sublet, Sr., never testified.  As the prosecutor pointed out, the jurors did\r\nnot know who he was, but could \"draw their own conclusions.\"  Further, the conduct at issue\r\nwas Sublet's non-verbal, emotional response to the prosecutor's closing argument.  Rushing\r\ntoward the jury rail was, arguably, more disruptive than the conduct at issue in <em>Landry</em> and\r\n<em>Gamboa,</em> but Sublet was quickly escorted out of the courtroom, and the jury was immediately\r\nremoved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the harm, if any, could have been cured by an instruction to disregard,\r\nappellant did not request this \"lesser remedy.\"<sup> (57)</sup>  Further, appellant has not carried his burden\r\nof showing a reasonable probability that the outburst interfered with the jury's verdict or\r\nposed a reasonable probability of injury to himself.  Appellant offers only conclusory\r\nassertions that this disturbance violated his constitutional right to an impartial jury and was\r\n\"designed\" to deny him a fair trial.  Point of error twenty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E. \tJury Instructions at the Guilt Stage</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error twenty-three, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury instruction at the guilt phase on temporary insanity caused by involuntary\r\nintoxication.  He argues that evidence of his belief that Chare had been giving him \"yard\r\ntreatment poison\" was evidence of involuntary intoxication.  He also points to Shunta's\r\ntestimony that, when appellant showed up in front of her house shortly after the offense, he\r\nwas behaving strangely and she thought he was on drugs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Section 8.01 of the Penal Code, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution that,\r\nat the time of the conduct charged, the defendant, as a result of severe mental disease or\r\ndefect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.<sup> (58)</sup>  We have held that Section 8.01(a)\r\nimplicitly encompasses the defense of temporary insanity due to involuntary intoxication.<sup> (59)</sup> \r\nAccordingly, in deciding whether the evidence raises the defense of involuntary intoxication,\r\nwe examine whether (1) the defendant exercised no independent judgment or volition in\r\ntaking the intoxicant; and (2) as a result of a \"severe mental disease or defect\" caused by the\r\ninvoluntary intoxication, the accused did not know that his conduct was wrong.<sup> (60)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the requested jury instruction did not correctly recite the applicable law. \r\nInstead, the requested instruction recited the law as it existed prior to legislative amendments\r\nin 1983:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>You are instructed that involuntary intoxication is a defense to prosecution for\r\nan offense when it is shown that the accused has exercised no independent\r\njudgment or volition in taking the intoxicant and that as a result of his\r\nintoxication the accused did not know that his conduct was wrong, or [was\r\nin]capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law allegedly\r\nviolated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When appellant committed this offense, it was no longer an affirmative defense to\r\nprosecution that the defendant, as a result of involuntary intoxication, was incapable of\r\nconforming his conduct to the requirements of the law.<sup> (61)</sup>  Therefore, appellant was not\r\nentitled to the specific instruction that he requested.<sup> (62)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the record shows that, during the charge conference at the guilt phase,\r\ndefense counsel explained that he was requesting the instruction on temporary insanity due\r\nto involuntary intoxication because appellant wanted it.  Counsel did not distinctly specify\r\nthe ground or basis for this requested instruction as required by Article 36.14.  Further, we\r\nare unable to find any evidence in the record that would support a finding that appellant did\r\nnot know that his conduct of stabbing his wife and two stepsons to death was \"wrong.\"<sup> (63)</sup>  In\r\nhis brief on appeal, appellant points to evidence that he believed his family was poisoning\r\nhim, but he fails to cite any record evidence that would support a rational jury finding that\r\nhe did not know that his murderous conduct was \"wrong.\"  Nor did he cite any such evidence\r\nto the trial judge when he requested this jury instruction.  Having failed to point out the\r\nfactual basis for his requested instruction to the trial judge, appellant failed to preserve this\r\nissue for appeal.<sup> (64)</sup>  Point of error twenty-three is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error twenty-four, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury charge at the guilt phase on self-defense.  He argues that his belief that he was\r\nbeing poisoned entitled him to this instruction, and that denying the instruction denied him\r\nthe right to present his defenses to the jury and therefore denied him his right to a fair trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA person is justified in using deadly force against another when and to the extent that\r\nhe reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect himself against another's\r\nuse or attempted use of unlawful deadly force.<sup> (65)</sup>  A defendant is justified in defending against\r\ndanger as he reasonably apprehends it.<sup> (66)</sup>  If the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable\r\nto the defendant, does not establish self-defense, the defendant is not entitled to an\r\ninstruction.<sup> (67)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant was not entitled to a self-defense instruction under the facts of this case. \r\nAppellant was charged with the murders of Harold and Raekwon, but he does not assert that\r\nhe reasonably believed that deadly force against his nine- and ten-year-old stepsons was\r\nimmediately necessary to protect himself.  At trial, there was no evidence that appellant\r\nreasonably apprehended any deadly force from his stepsons.  Appellant confessed that the\r\nboys were asleep in their bedroom when he decided to kill them, and that he went into their\r\nroom and woke them up, one by one,  to kill them.  Under these circumstances, the trial court\r\ndid not err in refusing appellant's requested instructions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, the record shows that, during the charge conference at the guilt phase,\r\ndefense counsel requested a jury instruction on self-defense.  Counsel explained that he was\r\nrequesting the instruction because appellant wanted it.  Counsel did not specify the facts or\r\nlegal theory that supported the submission of this defense.  Therefore, the error was forfeited\r\non appeal.<sup> (68)</sup>  Point of error twenty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>F. \tExpert Witness at the Punishment Phase</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-fifth point of error, appellant asserts, \"The trial court erred in overruling\r\nappellant's objection to the proffered expert testimony of witness A.P. Merillat.\"  Appellant\r\nargues that Merillat testified about subjects-the prison classification system and opportunities\r\nfor violence in the penitentiary-that were beyond his expertise.<sup> (69)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Evidence 702 permits a witness qualified by knowledge, skill,\r\nexperience, training, or education to testify on scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\nsubjects if the testimony would assist the trier of fact in understanding or determining a fact\r\nissue.  The party presenting the witness as an expert has the burden of proving that the expert\r\nis qualified.<sup> (70)</sup>  A witness's qualification to give an expert opinion may be derived from\r\nspecialized education, practical experience, a study of technical works, or a varying\r\ncombination of these things.<sup> (71)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen addressing fields of study that are based primarily upon experience and training\r\nas opposed to the scientific method, the appropriate questions are: (1) whether the field of\r\nexpertise is a legitimate one; (2) whether the subject matter of the expert's testimony is\r\nwithin the scope of that field; and (3) whether the expert's testimony properly relies upon\r\nand/or utilizes the principles involved in the field.<sup> (72)</sup>  The fact that the general subject matter\r\nis within the comprehension of the average jury does not require the exclusion of expert\r\ntestimony.<sup> (73)</sup>  \tThe question of whether a witness offered as an expert possesses the required\r\nqualifications is a question resting largely in the trial court's discretion.<sup> (74)</sup>  Absent a clear\r\nabuse of discretion, the trial court's decision to admit or exclude testimony will not be\r\ndisturbed.<sup> (75)</sup>  The appellate court must uphold the trial court's ruling if it was within the zone\r\nof reasonable disagreement.<sup> (76)</sup>  Appellate courts may consider several criteria in assessing\r\nwhether a trial court has clearly abused its discretion in ruling on an expert's qualifications,\r\nincluding the complexity of the field of expertise, the conclusiveness of the expert's opinion,\r\nand the centrality of the area of expertise to the case.<sup> (77)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the Rule 705 hearing, A.P. Merillat testified that he was a criminal investigator for\r\nthe Special Prosecutions Unit, which investigates and prosecutes offenses within the prison\r\nsystem.  Merillat testified that he had been investigating such crimes for almost twenty years\r\nand that he had testified in court many times concerning (1) the prison classification system\r\nthat would apply to convicted capital murderers who received life sentences; and (2) the\r\nopportunities for convicted capital murderers to be violent in prison.  Merillat acknowledged\r\nthat his knowledge of these subjects was mostly anecdotal, derived from his own\r\ninvestigations of prison crimes.  He testified that the Special Prosecutions Unit is not part of\r\nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"), but that he spent a year working with\r\ninternal affairs at TDCJ on use-of-force cases.  Merillat testified that he would not be giving\r\nan expert opinion particular to appellant's case but instead would testify generally about\r\nopportunities to be violent in the prison system.  Defense counsel questioned the need for\r\nexpert testimony on this subject, asserting that it was \"just common sense\" that there were\r\nopportunities for violence in prison.  Merillat responded that he had learned things through\r\nhis job that the general public, as well as most prison officials and politicians, did not know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel repeatedly expressed concern that Merillat would testify about\r\nspecific bad acts by individual prisoners in order to scare the jury.  Counsel argued that he\r\nwould have no way to verify the facts of these offenses if Merillat testified about them. \r\nCounsel also argued that Merillat was not qualified to testify about general classification and\r\nprison operations.  The trial court indicated that Merillat would not be allowed to testify\r\nabout particular incidents, but he would be allowed to answer general questions and testify\r\nabout numbers or statistics.  Counsel then questioned Merillat about his qualifications to\r\ntestify concerning numbers and statistics.  Merillat responded by referring to a list containing\r\nthe names of convicted capital murderers and the offenses they had committed while they\r\nwere in prison.  He stated that he expected to use that list as proof of his knowledge of the\r\nopportunities for violence in prison.  The only statistics he proposed to discuss were\r\ncontained in a report prepared by TDCJ.  Merillat acknowledged that anyone could testify\r\nabout what the report said, as it was widely available and no special expertise was required\r\nto interpret it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tToward the end of the hearing, counsel argued, \"He's not an expert in the field.  All\r\nhe's here to do is scare them about some anecdotal information he has about particular cases\r\nhe investigated in the past.  That's just a job, not expertise.\"  The trial court disagreed, stating\r\nagain that Merillat would be able to answer general questions, but also noting that the court\r\nwould be receptive to counsel's objections to testimony concerning specific incidents.  The\r\ncourt did not grant counsel's written motion in limine concerning specific bad acts because\r\nthe court had not had an opportunity to read through it.  The record does not reflect that\r\ncounsel re-urged his motion in limine before Merillat testified in the presence of the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the jury's presence, the prosecutor began to question Merillat about the prison\r\nclassification system, and defense counsel asked for an opportunity to conduct additional voir\r\ndire.  Counsel then questioned Merillat about his expertise on prison classification.  Merillat\r\ntestified that he had received the same classification training as TDCJ classification\r\nemployees.  Counsel objected again to Merillat's lack of formal training, pointing out that\r\nhe was never employed by TDCJ even though he spent a year working with TDCJ internal\r\naffairs.  Counsel's objection was overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMerillat then described the prison environment experienced by life-sentenced capital\r\nmurderers classified as G-3 inmates: they could go to chow hall and the library with other\r\ninmates, and they could go to school, medical facilities, and visitation.  They could not work\r\noutside the prison walls without direct armed supervision.  Merillat acknowledged that\r\nTDCJ's classification board could impose additional restrictions based on its review of an\r\ninmate's criminal history and records of bad acts, and in very limited circumstances an\r\ninmate might start out in administrative segregation or with a classification that was more\r\nrestrictive than G-3.  Even with restrictions, however, a significant level of violence occurred\r\nwithin the prison system.  Merillat testified that there were over 14,000 disciplinary\r\nconvictions for assaults by inmates on other inmates, over 5,000 disciplinary reports of\r\nassaults by inmates on staff, and 156 murders in prison between 1984 and 2008.  He also\r\nstated that inmates had escaped from prison.  He described the restrictive environment of\r\ndeath row and testified that even on death row, it was possible to commit crimes.  Merillat\r\nstated  that an inmate could choose to be violent or choose to be peaceable, and he specified\r\nthat he was not expressing any opinions about this particular case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMerillat's testimony was generalized educator-expertise information designed to\r\n\"assist\" the jury under Rule 702.  Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\r\nadmitting it after determining that Merillat was qualified to testify as an expert regarding the\r\nprison classification system and opportunities for violence in prison.  Point of error\r\ntwenty-five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>G. \tVictim-Impact Evidence</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh points of error, appellant asserts that the trial\r\ncourt erred in overruling his objections to State's Exhibits 115 and 116-the \"progress notes\"\r\nwritten by LaKenya and Garysha's therapist-which were admitted at the punishment phase. \r\nAppellant argues, \"The proffered evidence is not relevant as it amounts to extraneous victim\r\nimpact evidence.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that when the prosecutor offered Exhibits 115 and 116 into\r\nevidence, defense counsel objected generally that the information in them was not admissible\r\nand not relevant to any issue before the jury.  He did not specifically object that the exhibits\r\nwere extraneous victim impact evidence.  The trial court instructed counsel for both parties\r\nto approach the bench.  Following an off-the-record discussion, the court overruled the\r\nobjection and admitted the exhibits.  The prosecutor then called Garysha and LaKenya to\r\ntestify about the impact the offense had on them.  Appellant did not object to their\r\ntestimony.<sup> (78)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's specific complaint on appeal that Exhibits 115 and 116 were inadmissible\r\nextraneous victim impact evidence is not preserved by his general relevance objection at\r\ntrial.<sup> (79)</sup>   As appellant failed to preserve error, points of error twenty-six and twenty-seven are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>H. \tSufficiency of Future Dangerousness Evidence</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twenty-eighth point of error, appellant contends that the evidence of his future\r\ndangerousness was legally insufficient.  He asserts that he had no prior violent criminal\r\nbackground and that the defense experts testified that he was a low risk for future\r\ndangerousness.  Appellant further argues that none of the evidence presented at the\r\npunishment phase showed a probability that he would be a continuing threat to society if he\r\nwere sentenced to life in prison.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen reviewing the future dangerousness special issue, we view the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society.<sup> (80)</sup>  The circumstances of\r\nthe offense \"can be among the most revealing evidence of future dangerousness and alone\r\nmay be sufficient to support an affirmative answer to that special issue.\"<sup> (81)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the record contains ample evidence of appellant's future dangerousness.  The\r\nfacts of the offense alone would have been sufficient.  However, the State did not rely solely\r\non the facts of the offense.  At the punishment phase, the prosecutor introduced appellant's\r\njuvenile record, penitentiary packet, and disciplinary records.  The jury learned that, as a\r\njuvenile, appellant had been \"convicted\" of criminal mischief, theft, unlawful carrying of\r\nweapons, and burglary.<sup> (82)</sup>  As an adult, he had been convicted of aggravated robbery.  While\r\nhe was in prison for that offense, his disciplinary violations included failure to obey\r\nreasonable orders, masturbation in public, fighting, assaulting guards, and sodomy.  An\r\ninmate who had been housed with appellant in prison testified that appellant beat him up and\r\nraped him on several occasions.  Several officers testified about appellant's confrontational\r\nand violent behavior while he was in jail awaiting trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo former girlfriends testified that appellant physically assaulted them without\r\nwarning.  Garysha and LaKenya, as well as Chare's sister Nicole, testified about appellant's\r\ncontrolling and abusive behavior towards Chare and her children.  Nicole and LaKenya had\r\nurged Chare to leave appellant.  Nicole testified that, a few days after appellant killed Chare\r\nand the boys and fled to Austin, she was warned by appellant's daughter to stay away from\r\nher house because he had returned to Dallas to kill her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record, a rational jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was\r\na probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing\r\nthreat to society.  Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's answer to the\r\nfuture dangerousness special issue.  Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I. \tMitigation Special Issue</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's twenty-ninth point of error, he asserts that due process requires this\r\nCourt to review the sufficiency of mitigation evidence on appeal.  Appellant acknowledges\r\nthat this Court has held that a jury's negative answer to the mitigation special issue in capital\r\ncases will not be reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence, and we have rejected the claim\r\nthat this deprives a defendant of \"meaningful appellate review.\"<sup> (83)</sup>  He further acknowledges\r\nthat we have rejected the claim that, because meaningful appellate review of the jury's\r\nmitigation determination is impossible, the mitigation special issue violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment.<sup> (84)</sup>  We have likewise rejected the claim that it violates the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment.<sup> (85)</sup> <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNotwithstanding precedent, in his thirtieth point of error, appellant asserts that the\r\njury's answer to the mitigation special issue was so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence as to be unjust.  In support of this claim, he describes\r\ntestimony from his mother and aunt \"concerning [his] upbringing and mental illness,\"\r\nincluding his statements to them that Chare was poisoning him and that others were\r\nfollowing him or trying to kill him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe mitigation special issue \"confers upon the jury the ability to dispense mercy, even\r\nafter it has found a defendant eligible for the death penalty.\"<sup> (86)</sup>   There is no evidence that\r\nmust be considered to have mitigating value.<sup> (87)</sup>  \"Whether a particular piece of evidence is\r\nmitigating in the context of [the mitigation special] issue is a normative judgment that is not\r\namenable to appellate review.\"<sup> (88)</sup> </span><span>  We decline to attempt such a review here.  Points of error\r\ntwenty-nine and thirty are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>J. \tConstitutionality of Article 37.071</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-first point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in \"not\r\nconcluding the punishment hearing and imposing a life sentence based on the trial court\r\nbeing made aware of the issues supporting the reversal of the recent death-penalty case of\r\n<em>Smith v. [Texas</em>,<em>]</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span> (2004).\"  Appellant argues that the current punishment scheme\r\nin Texas violates \"the doctrines pronounced\" in several Supreme Court cases<sup> (89)</sup> because the\r\nmitigation special issue is \"nothing more than a nullification issue\" to the future\r\ndangerousness special issue.  Appellant asserts that the jury charges set forth in Article\r\n37.071 compare unfavorably with guidelines promulgated by the American Bar Association.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court cases cited by appellant concern jury instructions that were given\r\nprior to the 1991 amendment to Article 37.071.  That amendment set forth the mitigation\r\ninstruction that was given in appellant's case.<sup> (90)</sup>  Other than his conclusory statement that the\r\ncurrent mitigation issue is \"nothing more than a nullification issue,\" appellant makes no\r\nattempt to explain how the reasoning of cases involving jury instructions from before the\r\n1991 amendment operates to invalidate the jury instructions given in his case.<sup> (91)</sup>  In addition,\r\nappellant does not allege that the jury instructions in his case prevented the jury from giving\r\nmeaningful consideration and effect to any mitigating evidence.  Finally, appellant offers no\r\nsupporting legal authority or argument for his assertion that the trial court had a <em>sua sponte</em>\r\nduty to take the punishment decision away from the jury.  Thus, this claim is inadequately\r\nbriefed.<sup> (92)</sup>  Point of error thirty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-second point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing\r\nto provide a rational process for the jury to decide between a life sentence and the death\r\npenalty.  Appellant's entire argument is that the mitigation issue</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>is made vaguely conditional on the [special issue] on future dangerousness,\r\nburdening the consideration of mitigating circumstances that are not related to\r\nfuture dangerousness with a vague presumption in favor of death if the\r\nmitigating circumstances are somehow not \"sufficient\" in comparison to\r\nsomething not stated in the special issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant fails to specify any action that the trial court was required, but failed, to take.  Nor\r\ndoes he specify any statutory or constitutional violation.  This claim is inadequately briefed,\r\nand we decline to address it.<sup> (93)</sup>  Point of error thirty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirty-third, thirty-fourth, and thirty-fifth points of error, appellant asserts that\r\nthe trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it should answer \"yes\" to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue so long as 10 jurors agreed that one or more mitigating circumstances exist,\r\nseparately or in conjunction, sufficient to warrant a life sentence.  He complains that the jury\r\nshould have been instructed that the mitigation issue should be answered affirmatively so\r\nlong as 10 jurors agreed, even if they disagreed as to which mitigating circumstance or\r\ncircumstances were sufficient to warrant a life sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle 37.071, section 2(f)(3), requires the trial court to instruct jurors that they need\r\nnot agree on what particular evidence supports an affirmative answer to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue.  In this case, the trial court instructed the jurors in accordance with this\r\nrequirement.  To the extent that appellant urges that the instruction required by Article\r\n37.071, and given in his case, is unconstitutional because it does not comply with <em>Mills v.\r\nMaryland, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112085\"><a href=\"/opinion/112085/mills-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span> (1988), we have rejected such claims in the past.<sup> (94)</sup>  Points of error\r\nthirty-three, thirty-four, and thirty-five are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error thirty-six and thirty-seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erred\r\nby not informing the jury that a failure to agree unanimously on the mitigation special issue\r\nwould have \"the same dignity and respect\" as a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer and would have the\r\nsame legal effect as a \"no\" answer.  He argues that the failure to give this charge violated\r\nArticle 36.14, which gives effect to the \"due course of law\" provision of the Texas\r\nConstitution and the \"due process\" provision of the United States Constitution by requiring\r\nthat the jury charge distinctly set forth the law applicable to the case.  He asserts that the last\r\nsentence of Article 37.071, section 2(a)(1),<sup> (95)</sup> seeks to suppress and conceal important\r\ninformation from the jurors because they are not informed that a life sentence, rather than a\r\nmistrial, will result from a failure to answer the special issues.  Similarly, in his thirty-eighth\r\nand forty-third points of error, appellant asserts that the \"12/10\" rule in Texas capital jury\r\ncharges is a misrepresentation of the law and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as\r\nwell as a violation of due process because jurors never learn that if the jury as a whole cannot\r\nagree on an answer to one of the special issues, a life sentence will result.  This Court has\r\nrepeatedly rejected similar claims.<sup> (96)</sup>  We are not persuaded to revisit them here.  Points of\r\nerror thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and forty-three are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's thirty-ninth<sup> (97)</sup> point of error, he claims that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option.  He argues that\r\nArticle 37.071 is unconstitutional because it fails to provide a method for the State to\r\ndetermine the deathworthiness of the defendant.  Appellant complains that the method of\r\ndetermining which cases shall be prosecuted as capital offenses, and in which capital cases\r\nthe death penalty will be sought, varies from county to county.  He asserts that the failure of\r\nthe State to set forth uniform and specific standards to determine against whom a death\r\nsentence will be sought violates the principles set forth in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span> (2000),\r\nas well as his rights to equal protection and due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, Sections 13 and 19, of the Texas\r\nConstitution, and Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 1.04.<sup> (98)</sup>  This Court has\r\nrepeatedly rejected similar claims, and we are not persuaded to reconsider them here.<sup> (99)</sup>  Point\r\nof error thirty-nine is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fortieth point of error, appellant claims that Article 37.071 \"is unconstitutional\r\nin violation of the cruel and unusual punishment prohibition because it allows the jury too\r\nmuch discretion to determine who should live and who should die and because it lacks the\r\nminimal standards and guidance necessary for the jury to avoid the arbitrary and capricious\r\nimposition of the death penalty.\"  Appellant argues that, under the present Texas statute, the\r\njury has unfettered discretion that invites and permits arbitrary application of the death\r\npenalty in violation of <em>Furman v. Georgia,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (1972).  He complains that the\r\nmitigation instruction unconstitutionally allows the jury to impose a life sentence \"if, in their\r\nsole discretion, they choose to do so.\"  As such, he reasons, the Texas scheme does not insure\r\na reasonably consistent application of the death penalty.  Appellant also complains that the\r\njury has unfettered discretion because the jury can decide what evidence, if any, is mitigating,\r\nand can choose to completely disregard mitigating evidence.  This Court has repeatedly\r\nrejected claims that the mitigation special issue gives the jury unfettered discretion and\r\npermits the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty, and we are not persuaded\r\nto revisit those decisions here.<sup> (100)</sup>  Point of error forty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-first point of error, appellant claims that Article 37.071 violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution as interpreted in <em>Penry II</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118438\"><a href=\"/opinion/118438/penry-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span> (2001),\r\nbecause the mitigation special issue sends \"mixed signals\" to the jurors, thereby rendering\r\nany verdict intolerable and unreliable.  We have repeatedly rejected similar challenges, and\r\nwe decline to review our prior decisions on this issue.<sup> (101)</sup>  Point of error forty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-second point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying\r\nhis motion to hold that Article 37.071, subsections 2(e) and (f), violate Article I, Sections 10\r\nand 13, of the Texas Constitution, which guarantee that any punishment for an offense will\r\nbe in accordance with the law.  He asserts that subsections 2(e) and (f), which set forth the\r\njury instructions for the mitigation special issue, are not in accordance with the law and are\r\nunconstitutional because they shift the burden of proof to the defendant and essentially\r\nreduce the State's burden of proof concerning punishment.  We have previously rejected\r\nthese claims, and we will not revisit them here.<sup> (102)</sup>  Point of error forty-two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-fourth point of error, appellant claims that the Texas death penalty scheme\r\nviolated his \"rights against cruel and unusual punishment, [his right to] an impartial jury, and\r\n[his right] to due process\" under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the\r\nUnited States Constitution because of vague and undefined terms in the jury instructions. \r\nSpecifically, appellant argues that the terms \"probability,\" \"continuing threat to society,\" and\r\n\"criminal acts of violence,\" should have been defined in the jury charge at punishment\r\nbecause these terms \"are so vague and indefinite as to be violative of [a]ppellant's\r\nfundamental constitutional rights.\"  We have repeatedly rejected these arguments, and we are\r\nnot persuaded to reconsider them here.<sup> (103)</sup>  Point of error forty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-fifth and forty-sixth points of error, appellant claims that the Texas death\r\npenalty scheme is contrary to the United States and Texas Constitutions because it is\r\nimpossible to simultaneously restrict the jury's discretion to impose the death penalty while\r\nalso allowing the jury unlimited discretion to consider all evidence mitigating against\r\nimposition of the death penalty.<sup> (104)</sup></span><span>  Relying on Justice Blackmun's dissent in <em>Callins v.\r\nCollins</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></span> (1994), appellant declares that the death penalty scheme is\r\nunconstitutional because it fails to adhere to principled guidelines in weighing punishment\r\nevidence.<sup> (105)</sup>  This Court has repeatedly rejected this claim, and we are not persuaded to\r\nreconsider it.<sup> (106)</sup>  Points of error forty-five and forty-six are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his forty-seventh point of error, appellant claims that the mitigation special issue\r\nis unconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the State with regard to\r\naggravating evidence, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\r\nStates Constitution.  He argues that the mitigation special issue is a conduit for aggravating\r\nas well as mitigating factors, and that by instructing jurors to determine whether there are\r\n\"sufficient\" mitigating circumstances, the mitigation issue in effect tells jurors to consider\r\nany aggravating factors that may outweigh the mitigating factors.  He reasons that the\r\nlanguage of the statute is unconstitutional because it implies that the defense has a burden\r\nto disprove aggravating circumstances.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy the time a jury considers the mitigation special issue, jurors cannot increase a\r\ndefendant's maximum punishment because they have already found him guilty and made an\r\naffirmative finding on the future dangerousness special issue.<sup> (107)</sup>  At that point, the jury has\r\nalready determined that aggravating circumstances render the defendant eligible for the death\r\npenalty.<sup> (108)</sup>  Therefore, a trial court does not err in declining to assign the burden on the\r\nmitigation issue to the State.<sup> (109)</sup>  Point of error forty-seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Delivered: October 20, 2010</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do not publish\r\n<p>1.

The record does not reflect that either party supplemented the record with regard to any\r\nprior outbursts.  Our independent review of the record reveals that during a portion of the\r\nprosecutor's opening argument that described Harold's murder, there was crying in the audience\r\nand a pause in the proceedings.  The prosecutor stated, \"I'm sorry.  But [appellant] wasn't\r\nthrough yet,\" and went on to describe the murder of Raekwon.  Later, during the State's\r\nexamination of Chare's sister, Nicole, at the punishment phase, someone in the audience called\r\nout, \"Bring it on.\"  The examination then continued.  We are unable to locate any objection or\r\nmotion responsive to either of these prior outbursts.  We decline to infer preservation or harm\r\nfrom this sparse record.  <em>Cf.

Appellant did not object at trial to the jury instructions.  Nor did he call the trial court's\r\nattention to <em>Smith v. Texas</em> or explain how he believed the holding in that case might affect his\r\ncase.\r\n</p><p>92.  Tex. R. App. P. 38.1.\r\n</p><p>93.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n</p><p>94.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Williams v.

Crim. App. 2009) (finding that the failure to give this\r\ninstruction, although statutory error, was not constitutional error that deprived appellant of a\r\nunanimous verdict or a fair trial). \r\n</p><p>95.  Appellant's brief cites to Article 37.0711, ยง 3(3)(i), which is applicable to convictions\r\nfor offenses committed before September 1, 1991.  Because appellant's offense was committed\r\nin 2007, we presume that he means to cite to the last sentence of Article 37.071, ยง 2(a)(1), which\r\nis the analogous provision applicable to convictions for offenses committed on or after\r\nSeptember 1, 1991.  Both provisions state that neither the court nor the parties may inform a juror\r\nor prospective juror of the effect of the jury's failure to agree on the special issues.\r\n</p><p>96.  <em>See, e.g., Threadgill v.

In his brief, appellant prefaces his argument concerning points of error thirty-nine\r\nthrough forty-seven with an acknowledgment that we have previously rejected these points.  He\r\ninvites us to review \"any prior stand on any issue\" and states his intention to preserve these\r\npoints of error for federal review.\r\n</p><p>98.  Appellant offers no separate argument concerning any state constitutional violations,\r\nand so we resolve this claim under the federal constitution only.  <em>See Heitman,</em> 815 S.W.2d at\r\n690 n.23.\r\n</p><p>99.  <em>Neal v.

Citing <em>Penry I,</em> 492 U.S. at 319, he argues further that the \"focus upon aggravating\r\ncircumstances, to the exclusion of mitigating evidence, clearly violates the constitutional\r\nmandate of individualized sentencing.\"  This argument is inapposite because nothing in the\r\nrecord indicates that mitigating evidence was excluded or that the jury was prevented from giving\r\nmeaningful consideration and effect to any mitigating evidence.\r\n</p><p>106.  <em>See Escamilla v.
