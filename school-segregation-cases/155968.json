Before the Court are\n\nplaintiff COMPTEL’s [52] and defendant FCC’s [53] Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. 1\n\nIn general, COMPTEL seeks an order enjoining the FCC from withholding the records it\n\nrequested and compelling the FCC to produce unredacted versions of those records, and a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the FCC has violated the FOIA. The FCC seeks a judgment that it\n\nconducted a reasonable search, produced all responsive documents, and properly withheld\n\ninformation under statutory FOIA exemptions.\n\n\n1\n  COMPTEL submitted a Memorandum [52] of Points and Authorities in Support of Summary Judgment, ECF No.\n52, but not a formal motion for summary judgment. However, given that defendant FCC filed an Opposition to the\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities and COMPTEL filed a Reply, the Court deems the Memorandum a motion\nfor summary judgment. In addition to the parties’ cross motions, the Court considered the following filings, and\ntheir attached exhibits: COMPTEL’s Statement [52-1] of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute;\nFCC’s Opposition [54] to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment; COMPTEL’s Reply [56] to Defendant’s\nOpposition to COMPTEL’s Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Memorandum [53] of Points and Authorities in\nSupport of its Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Statement [53-1] of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute\nand the attached Supplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster and Vaughn Index [53-2]; COMPTEL’s Opposition\n[55] to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Reply [57] in Support of its Motion for Summary\nJudgment; the FCC’s Notice [58] of Supplemental Release of Information; and COMPTEL’s Reply [59] to\nDefendant’s Notice of Supplemental Release of Information.\n\f       The Court cannot grant summary judgment to either party at this time. First, there is a\n\nfactual dispute as to whether the FCC conducted a search in response to COMPTEL’s most\n\nrecent FOIA request. More importantly, the FCC has not demonstrated that it conducted an\n\nadequate search in response to that request. This alone precludes summary judgment for the\n\nFCC. However, even if the FCC had demonstrated that it conducted an adequate search, the\n\nagency has not provided sufficient detail regarding its justifications for withholding certain\n\ninformation under various FOIA exemptions. As the D.C. Circuit has reiterated numerous times,\n\nagencies cannot rely on “conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions,” as it has done\n\nhere. Finally, in response to an administrative order, the FCC released additional responsive\n\ninformation to COMPTEL after the pending motions for summary judgment were filed and ripe.\n\nHowever, the FCC has not amended its submissions to the Court to account for this release and\n\nthe parties appear to disagree about whether the FCC has satisfied its obligations under the\n\nadministrative order. Because the Court cannot determine which information has now been\n\nreleased and which withheld, it cannot evaluate the FCC’s remaining redactions.\n\n       Although the FCC has not met its burden for summary judgment, the Court also lacks\n\nsufficient information by which to grant summary judgment for COMPTEL. As is often the\n\npractice with FOIA cases in which the record is not sufficiently developed, the Court will DENY\n\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE the parties’ motions.              The FCC is directed to file an amended\n\ndeclaration and Vaughn index to address the issues identified in this Opinion. Upon submission\n\nof the revised declaration and index, the parties may re-file their cross-motions, as appropriate.\n\nA separate Order consistent with this Opinion shall issue this date.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fI.      BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        COMPTEL is a non-profit trade association whose members are communications service\n\nproviders and their supplier partners. Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 52\n\n[hereinafter Pl.’s Mem P. & A.]. COMPTEL first filed an electronic FOIA request with the FCC\n\nin April 2005. Although COMPTEL has not provided the Court with a copy of the request, the\n\nparties agree that it sought “all pleadings and correspondence” contained in File No. EB-04-IH-\n\n0342, which was opened by the FCC Enforcement Bureau (“EB”) to investigate SBC\n\nCommunications, Inc., now AT&T. 2 Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶¶ 1–2, ECF No. 52-1 [hereinafter\n\nPl.’s SMF]; Def.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts in Opp’n to Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶¶ 1–2. In August 2004,\n\nthe SBC had voluntarily reported to the FCC that it may have violated the Commission’s rules in\n\nconnection with SBC’s receipt of universal service funds for Connecticut public schools under\n\nthe E-Rate, or Education-Rate program. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 2. As part of the EB’s subsequent\n\ninvestigation, SBC provided the FCC with a variety of documents which included cost and\n\npricing data, billing and payment dates, and other information. Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4, July\n\n25, 2012, ECF No. 53-2. The FCC terminated its investigation in December 2004 upon issuing\n\nan Order adopting a Consent Decree. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 3.\n\n        After COMPTEL requested records of the investigation, SBC sought confidential\n\ntreatment, under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 7(C), of the materials it provided to the FCC. Pl.’s\n\nSMF ¶ 4. The FCC then notified COMPTEL via email that it was reviewing about 3200 pages\n\nof documents “potentially responsive” to the FOIA request. Id., Ex. 2.\n\n\n\n\n2\n SBC merged with AT&T in November 2005. The Court and the parties alternatively refer to that corporate entity\nas SBC or AT&T depending on the time period at issue.\n\n                                                      3\n\f        In August 2005, the FCC granted in part and denied in part COMPTEL’s FOIA request.\n\nIn response to SBC’s request for confidential treatment, the FCC agreed to withhold certain\n\ninformation in SBC submissions pursuant to Exemption 4, including “costs and pricing data,\n\n[SBC’s] billing and payment dates, and identifying information of SBC’s staff, contractors, and\n\nthe representatives of its contractors and customers.” Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4. The FCC also\n\nwithheld the names of individuals identified in SBC’s submissions pursuant to Exemptions 6 and\n\n7(C), and drafts of EB “pleadings and correspondence, and internal memoranda and emails\n\ndiscussing the SBC investigation” pursuant to Exemption 5. Id. The FCC stated that it would\n\nrelease any non-exempt documents to COMPTEL within ten days if AT&T failed to file an\n\napplication for review with the FCC’s Office of General Counsel. Pl’s SMF ¶ 9. Both AT&T\n\nand COMPTEL timely filed applications for review. Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n        The FCC failed to act on the applications for review within the 20-day statutory period, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(G)(6)(A)(ii), and COMPTEL filed this action on October 5, 2006 to enjoin\n\nthe FCC from withholding the documents requested. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 11; Compl., ECF No. 1.\n\nAT&T intervened and cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by all parties in February\n\n2007. When the FCC argued that COMPTEL had waived its request for certain documents,\n\nCOMPTEL filed a second FOIA request on April 16, 2007 for all documents “referenced in the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster [and] all correspondence with any third party\n\ncontained in FCC Case file no. EB-04-IH-0342.” See In the Matter of COMPTEL, 27 F.C.C.R.\n\n7705, 2012 WL 2354823 (June 19, 2012). This 2007 FOIA request appears to be the only\n\nrequest at issue in the pending cross-motions. At least in theory, though, it should have resulted\n\nin a response that is at least co-extensive with a response to the 2005 request. 3\n\n\n3\n  The FCC asserts that the 2007 request is the subject of these cross-motions, Def.’s MSJ 5, and COMPTEL appears\nto agree, focusing almost all of its arguments on 193 pages of documents provided in response to that request.\n\n                                                       4\n\f        Because the FCC administrative review process remained pending, Judge Kennedy, then\n\nassigned to the case, denied without prejudice the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment\n\nand stayed the case until final agency action was completed. ECF No. 32; Minute Order, Mar. 5,\n\n2008. The FCC later denied AT&T’s application for review, finding that Exemption 7(C) may\n\nprotect the personal privacy interests of individuals identified in law enforcement documents, but\n\nnot the privacy interests of corporations. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 17. AT&T appealed to the Third Circuit\n\nwhich ruled for them. AT&T v. FCC, 582 F.3d 490 (3rd Cir. 2009). In March 2011, the\n\nSupreme Court reversed, holding that Exemption 7(C) does not protect privacy interests of\n\ncorporations and that AT&T could not invoke the exemption to shield documents provided to\n\nFCC during the investigation. FCC v. AT&T,131 S. Ct. 1177 (2011). When the FCC failed to\n\nrelease documents to COMPTEL after this decision, COMPTEL filed, and the Court granted, a\n\nmotion to lift the stay in the instant litigation.\n\n        The FCC has given varying estimates of the number of pages of material responsive to\n\nCOMPTEL’s FOIA request. While an early FCC email response to COMPTEL identified 3200\n\npages of “potentially responsive” documents, the FCC later significantly reduced this estimate.\n\nAt the time of the 2007 cross-motions for summary judgment, the FCC estimated that there were\n\napproximately 508–544 pages of responsive documents, including 191–237 pages which the\n\nFCC planned to withhold under Exemption 5.\n\n        On June 3, 2011, the FCC sent COMPTEL 362 pages of redacted documents, which\n\nappear to include all of the information for which Exemption 5 was not invoked, along with\n\n\n\n\nHowever, COMPTEL also repeatedly refers to a statement made by the FCC in response to COMPTEL’s 2005\nrequest that the FCC had identified 3200 pages of potentially responsive documents. Thus, the Court is unsure\nwhether COMPTEL continues to challenge the adequacy of the search conducted in response to the 2005 request.\n\n                                                     5\n\ffifteen pages of material that had been identified as protected by Exemption 5. 4 On November 1,\n\n2011, the FCC released an additional 193 pages (65 documents), bringing the total to 555 pages\n\nof material released. Redactions were made to these materials pursuant to Exemptions 4, 5, 6,\n\nand 7(C). The present controversy relates to this November 2011 release of 193 pages.\n\n        COMPTEL filed a second administrative application for review of the FCC’s redactions\n\nto these documents on November 11, 2011. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 23. On June 19, 2012, the FCC issued\n\na Memorandum Opinion and Order denying in part and granting in part the application for\n\nreview. Specifically, it ordered EB to provide the names of certain SBC and FCC staff that had\n\nbeen publicly identified and thus had been redacted in error under Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n\n        The instant cross-motions for summary judgment were filed in July 2012. The FCC did\n\nnot release the additional information required by the June 2012 Order until the cross-motions\n\nwere pending and ripe for review. Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info., ECF No. 58. COMPTEL\n\nreplied to that supplemental release, asserting that the FCC had (strangely) included new\n\nredactions of information previously released and that it did not appear to have released\n\ninformation the Order required to be provided. Pl.’s Reply to Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info.,\n\nECF No. 59 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply to Release].                The FCC has not filed a supplemental\n\ndeclaration or revised Vaughn index to account for the latest release of information.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  COMPTEL states that the documents include “the publicly available plea agreements and FCC decision described\nin . . . Paragraph 3 of [Ms. Lancaster’s] Supplemental Declaration” (an estimated 64 pages); a two-page email\nbetween FCC staff; a four-page email chain; and the documents “described in Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Ms. Lancaster’s\nSupplemental Declaration.” Pl.’s SMF ¶ 19. However, this would amount to all 538 pages identified in the\nSupplemental Declaration. The Court assumes, therefore, that all 347 pages of non-Exemption 5 material was\nprovided, along with the six additional pages specifically cited by COMPTEL, and an additional, unidentified nine\npages of material protected by Exemption 5.\n\n                                                       6\n\fII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       A.      FOIA Generally\n\n       The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, requires federal agencies to make\n\ncertain records publicly available. FOIA requires that agencies, upon request, “make the records\n\npromptly available to any person.” Id. § 552(a)(3)(A). The Agency shall determine within\n\ntwenty business days of receipt whether to comply with a request and shall immediately notify\n\nthe requester of its determination and reasons therefore. Id. § 552(a)(6)(A). However, failure to\n\nmeet the time limit is not a basis for denying an agency summary judgment. See Tijerina v.\n\nWalters, 821 F.2d 789, 799 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n       FOIA provides nine exemptions from the disclosure requirement which are to be\n\n“narrowly construed.” FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982). Four of these, Exemptions\n\n4, 5, 6, and 7(C), are relevant to this case and described in greater detail below.\n\n       Should an agency deny a FOIA request, in whole or in part, the agency must “make a\n\nreasonable effort” to estimate and provide to the requester “the volume of any requested matter\n\nthe provision of which is denied . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(F). Additionally, to the extent an\n\nexemption is invoked, any “reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided” after\n\ndeletion of the exempt portions. Id. § 552(b). The “amount of information deleted, and the\n\nexemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the\n\nrecord . . . .” Id. In FOIA litigation, district courts must consider segregability sua sponte even\n\nwhen the parties have not raised such claims. Trans–Pac. Policing Agreement v. Customs Serv.,\n\n177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       B.      Summary Judgment and FOIA\n\n       Summary judgment should be granted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). FOIA\n\ncases are typically and appropriately decided on motions for summary judgment. Brayton v.\n\nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative, 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n       By statute, the agency bears the burden in litigation to justify withholding any records.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4). This is in part because of the “strong presumption in favor of disclosure,”\n\nDep’t. of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991), and because FOIA requesters face an\n\ninformation asymmetry given that the agency possesses the requested information and decides\n\nwhether it should be withheld or disclosed. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 145–\n\n46 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, even where the requester has moved for summary judgment, the\n\nGovernment “‘ultimately [has] the onus of proving that the [documents] are exempt from\n\ndisclosure.’” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 185 F.3d 898, 904–05 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Campbell, 593 F.2d 1023, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).\n\n       To satisfy its burden to show the applicability of an exemption, an agency may rely on\n\ndetailed affidavits, declarations, a Vaughn index, in camera review, or a combination of these\n\ntools. A Vaughn index in combination with agency declarations is the typical way agencies\n\nprovide courts with the information required.        A Vaughn index correlates each withheld\n\ndocument, or portion thereof, with a particular FOIA exemption and the justification for\n\nnondisclosure. Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827 (D.C. Cir. 1973). While agency affidavits\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fare accorded a presumption of good faith, SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1991), they must “‘provide a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying\n\nthe reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the\n\nparticular part of a withheld document to which they apply.’” Judicial Watch v. FDA, 449 F.3d\n\nat 146 (citation omitted)); see also EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 86 (1973). The agency should\n\n“disclose as much information as possible without thwarting the exemption’s purpose.” Hall v.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 552 F. Supp. 2d 23, 27 (D.D.C. 2008) (quoting King v. Dep’t of Justice, 830\n\nF.2d 210, 224 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). Again, “‘conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions’\n\nare unacceptable.” Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citations omitted); see\n\nalso Vaughn, 484 F.2d at 826.\n\nIII.     DISCUSSION\n\n         A.       Jurisdiction\n\n         This Court has jurisdiction to decide the pending cross-motions. The U.S. District Court\n\nfor the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to “enjoin the agency from withholding agency\n\nrecords and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a)(4)(B). District courts are to examine FOIA matters de novo. Id. 5\n\n         B.       Adequacy of FCC’s Search\n\n         COMPTEL states that it “has not challenged the reasonableness of the FCC’s search,”\n\nonly the “adequacy of its production,” and does not specifically allege bad faith by the FCC.\n\n5\n  FOIA requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before a requester may bring suit. Spannaus v. U.S. Dep’t. of\nJustice, 824 F.2d 52, 58 (D.C. Cir. 1987). While this is a jurisprudential, rather than jurisdictional, requirement, it\n“precludes judicial review if the purposes of exhaustion and the particular administrative scheme support such a\nbar.” Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256, 1259 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the\ndefendant does not suggest, nor does it appear, that COMPTEL failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The FCC\ndid not comply with statutory response time limits and COMPTEL thus “constructively” exhausted administrative\nremedies with respect to its 2005 request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C). Additionally, though COMPTEL filed a\nsecond FOIA request in 2007, to the extent it needed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that request,\nit did so constructively when the FCC again did not meet statutory time limits.\n\n                                                          9\n\fPl.’s Reply to Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s MSJ 2, ECF No. 56 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply]. Nevertheless,\n\nCOMPTEL suggests the FCC may have withheld documents and seeks an order compelling the\n\nFCC to “disclose the total volume of documents responsive to COMPTEL’s FOIA request . . .\n\nincluding the other 2600 to 2700 pages identified as potentially responsive” in a 2005 email.\n\nPl.’s Mem P. & A. 37. Although COMPTEL disclaims an intent to challenge the adequacy of\n\nthe FCC’s search, the Court must consider the issue to decide the FCC’s motion for summary\n\njudgment. See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Summ. J. 1, 10, ECF No. 53 [hereinafter Def.’s Mem.\n\nP. & A.] (seeking judgment as a matter of law that FCC conducted a reasonable search).\n\n       “To prevail on summary judgment . . . the defending ‘agency must show beyond material\n\ndoubt . . . that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\n\ndocuments.’” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1114 (quoting Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705 F.2d\n\n1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). The adequacy of an agency’s search is measured by a case-by-\n\ncase standard of reasonableness that examines the method of the search, not whether additional\n\nresponsive documents might exist. Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990);\n\nSteinberg v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 23 F.3d 548, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Agency affidavits\n\nmay be submitted by an official who coordinated, or has personal knowledge of, the search, and\n\nneed not be from each individual who participated in the search. See SafeCard Servs., 926 F.2d\n\nat 1200. However, summary judgment is improper where “agency affidavits . . . do not denote\n\nwhich files were searched, or by whom, do not reflect any systematic approach to document\n\nlocation, and do not provide information specific enough to enable [the requester] to challenge\n\nthe procedures utilized.” Weisberg v. Dep’t. of Justice, 627 F.2d 365, 371 (D.C. Cir. 1980).\n\n       The history of this case makes it difficult for the Court to address the adequacy of the\n\nFCC’s search.     First, the present cross-motions for summary judgment relate only to\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fCOMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request which requested all documents “referenced in the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster” submitted with the FCC’s earlier motion for\n\nsummary judgment, as well as “all correspondence with any third party contained in FCC Case\n\nfile no. EB-04-IH-0342.” See In the Matter of COMPTEL, 27 F.C.C.R. 7705. 6 Thus, assuming\n\nthat the search in response to the 2005 request was adequate and that Ms. Lancaster’s\n\nsupplemental declaration listed all responsive documents, the 2007 request should result in the\n\ndisclosure of at least as much information as the 2005 request, if not more given COMPTEL’s\n\nadditional request for “all correspondence with any third party.”\n\n        However, there remains a possible dispute of fact as to whether, “[i]n response to the\n\n2007 FOIA request, . . . Commission staff searched the Commission’s files and staff e-mails for\n\ndocuments responsive to the request.” Compare Def.’s SMF ¶ 11 (making this assertion) and\n\nLancaster Suppl. Decl., July 25, 2012 (same), with Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts in Opp’n to Def.’s\n\nStmt. Mat. Facts 2, ECF No. 55-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s SMF in Opp’n] (disputing the assertion).\n\nCOMPTEL disputes that the Commission conducted a search, asserting that “all of the\n\ndocuments responsive to COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request were identified in the Declaration and\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster filed with this Court on February 12, 2007 and\n\nApril 13, 2011.” Pl.’s SMF in Opp’n 2. 7 Whether this is a genuine dispute of fact need not be\n\nresolved here because it is not just the fact that a search occurred, but also the adequacy of the\n\n\n\n6\n COMPTEL characterizes the 2007 request as being only for documents “already identified in Ms. Lancaster’s\nSupplemental Declaration” Pl.’s SMF ¶ 15, though the request seems to have been somewhat broader.”\n7\n Despite COMPTEL’s opposition, the FCC asserts that the statement is not in genuine dispute. First, it argues that\nCOMPTEL has not identified any contradictory evidence to show that the FCC did not complete a search. The\nCourt notes however that, as with all other FOIA plaintiffs, there is an information asymmetry that inhibits\nCOMPTEL from offering evidence regarding whether the FCC actually conducted a search. Second, the FCC\nargues that Judy Lancaster’s prior declarations (which were given before the FCC even received the 2007 request)\nsupport its contention that it conducted a search in response to the 2007 request. This is not possible since those\ndeclarations were executed before the 2007 request. However, Ms. Lancaster’s most recent declaration does lend\nsome support to the FCC’s contention.\n\n                                                        11\n\fsearch, that is required for summary judgment. The Court finds the FCC’s declaration to be\n\ninsufficient to demonstrate the adequacy of its search as well.\n\n       The most recent Lancaster declaration describes the FCC’s search in two sentences,\n\nstating that the FCC “searched the Commission’s files and staff e-mails for documents\n\nresponsive to the request” and that staff “reviewed each document[,] . . . discarded non-\n\nresponsive documents, and marked each responsive document for redaction.” Lancaster Supp.\n\nDecl. ¶ 5. The FCC provides no additional information about the search method used, the files\n\nreviewed, or the identity of the parties conducting the search. In fact, Ms. Lancaster does not\n\nstate whether she was involved in or otherwise has personal knowledge of the search, saying\n\nonly that she has been an EB attorney since 1999. Moreover, the FCC’s most recent release of\n\ninformation casts doubt on the adequacy of its search. Specifically, COMPTEL points out that\n\npreviously redacted email headers have now been disclosed on all emails released by the FCC.\n\nPl.’s Reply to Release 10. Those headers reveal that all of the released emails came from the\n\nemail account of David Janas despite the fact that numerous FCC employees appear to have been\n\ninvolved in the SBC investigation. Id. Thus, unless David Janas was a party to every email\n\nchain involving the SBC investigation, searching for emails only from his account would not\n\nresult in an adequate search.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court cannot grant summary judgment for the FCC\n\nbecause it cannot find, based on the evidence before it, that the FCC has conducted an adequate\n\nsearch. However, because COMPTEL has not challenged the adequacy of the FCC’s search, the\n\nCourt also cannot grant summary judgment for COMPTEL on this point. Instead, the FCC will\n\nbe required to submit a revised declaration which more fully describes its search. While the\n\nCourt could conclude its analysis here, the Court now also addresses the FCC’s invocation of\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fFOIA exemptions. Assuming the FCC can demonstrate the adequacy of its search, its current\n\nVaughn index and declaration would be inadequate to demonstrate that the agency has properly\n\ninvoked FOIA exemptions to withhold redacted information.\n\n       C.      Adequacy of Vaughn Index and Invocation of Exemptions\n\n       The FCC’s Vaughn index and declaration are insufficient for several reasons.\n\n       First, as outlined below, they rely on conclusory assertions to justify withholding\n\ninformation under the FOIA exemptions.\n\n       Second, while the FCC states that “all reasonably segregable, non-exemption information\n\n. . . [was] provided to the Requester,” Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 5, this is insufficient to meet the\n\nFCC’s burden with respect to FOIA segregability requirements. The Vaughn index should\n\nindicate, with respect to each document, that any reasonably segregable information has been\n\nreleased. Krikorian v. Dep’t of State, 984 F.2d 461, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1993). As the FCC’s Vaughn\n\nindex stands now, the Court cannot even tell whether the entire contents of a given document\n\nhave been redacted or whether only portions have been withheld.\n\n       Third, the FCC has not amended its Vaughn index to account for information it released\n\nto COMPTEL after the motions for summary judgment were ripe. As a result, the Court cannot\n\ndetermine what information remains redacted.\n\n               1.      Exemption 4\n\n       The FCC invokes Exemption 4 to redact information from 17 documents. Specifically, it\n\nseeks to redact the names and/or phone numbers of SBC staff and contractors, which it\n\ncategorizes as “competitively sensitive” (Documents 13–15, 19, 26, 31, 33, 40–44, and 64);\n\n“competitively sensitive information regarding settlement negotiations” (Documents 14–15, 20,\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f26); “confidential settlement information”; and SBC’s “competitively sensitive financial\n\ninformation” (Documents 27, 31, 34, 42–44).\n\n         FOIA Exemption 4 protects from disclosure “trade secrets and commercial or financial\n\ninformation obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).\n\nBecause the FCC has not asserted that any redacted information contains trade secrets, the Court\n\nonly addresses the test for “commercial or financial” information. Such information is exempt\n\nonly if it is (1) commercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or\n\nconfidential. Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\n\n         The terms “commercial” or “financial” in Exemption 4 “are to be given their ‘ordinary\n\nmeanings’ . . .” and are construed broadly. Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26,\n\n38 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d at 1290\n\n(citations omitted)). Commercial information need not be limited to information that “reveal[s]\n\nbasic commercial operations,” but may include any information in which the submitter has a\n\n“commercial interest,” see Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d at 1290\n\n(citations omitted), such as business sales statistics, research data, overhead and operating costs,\n\nand financial conditions, see Landfair v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 645 F. Supp. 325, 327 (D.D.C.\n\n1986).    Although defined broadly, courts have rejected Exemption 4 protection for some\n\ninformation. See, e.g., Chi. Tribune v. FAA, 1998 WL 242611, at *2–3 (N.D. Ill. May 7, 1998).\n\n         Information may be “obtained from a person” if provided by individuals, corporations, or\n\nnumerous other entities, but not if it was generated by the federal government. See Bd. of Trade\n\nv. CFTC, 627 F.2d 392, 404 (D.C. Cir 1980). However, government-prepared records may be\n\nprotected if they summarize information obtained from another person. See, e.g., Gulf & W.\n\nIndus. v. United States, 615 F.2d 527, 529–30 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f        Finally, if commercial or financial information was obtained from a person, it must be\n\nprivileged or confidential to be protected by Exemption 4. The test for confidentiality turns on\n\nwhether the information was submitted to the agency voluntarily or involuntarily. Voluntarily\n\nsubmitted commercial or financial information is confidential “if it is of a kind that would\n\ncustomarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.” Critical\n\nMass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992). On\n\nthe other hand, involuntarily submitted information is confidential if disclosure is likely either\n\n“(1) to impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or (2) to\n\ncause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was\n\nobtained.” Nat’l Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C. Cir. 1974).\n\n                          a.       Names and Contact Information of SBC/AT&T Employees and\n                                   Contractors\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 4 to redact the names and/or phone numbers of SBC staff\n\nand contractors in Documents 13–15, 19, 26, 31, 33, 40–44, and 64. 8 COMPTEL argues that in\n\nsome cases the FCC has improperly invoked Exemption 4. 9 Though it does not explain exactly\n\nwhy the redactions fail, it seems to imply that names do not meet the definition of “commercial\n\nor financial information.” See Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 18, 30–31; Pl.’s Reply 10.                       Mysteriously,\n\nCOMPTEL also states that it “has no objection to the redaction of the AT&T employee’s contact\n\ninformation,” 10 Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. 31, or to the redaction of the names of SBC contractors. Pl.’s\n\nReply 9. As the Court interprets these possibly conflicting statements, COMPTEL objects only\n\n8\n  According to its Vaughn index, the FCC also protects the names of SBC staff and contractors pursuant to\nExemption 5 (Document 13), Exemption 6 (Document 31, 33, 40–44, and 64) and Exemption 7(C) (Documents 13–\n15, 33–34, 40–44, 64). Because of a lack of detail in the Vaughn index, the Court presumes, but cannot be sure that\nthe same names are redacted under all of the exemptions. The FCC should clarify this in its amended filing.\n9\n  COMPTEL states that the FCC has improperly deleted “the names of authors, addresses, [and] ‘contacts’ or\nsenders of faxes to the Commission.” Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 18 (citing Documents 14–15, 19, 41–42, 64, and 65).\n10\n  COMPTEL makes this statement in the context of redactions made to Document 13 though it presumably would\nnot object to the redaction of AT&T or SBC employee contact information in other documents either.\n\n                                                        15\n\fto the redaction of the names of SBC staff and not to the redaction of their contact information or\n\nto the redaction of the names or contact information of SBC contractors.\n\n        The FCC has not met its burden to show that names and contact information should be\n\nexempt as confidential commercial or financial information. Names clearly are not financial\n\ninformation and thus the FCC must consider them to be commercial in nature. While the Court\n\nassumes corporations can have a commercial interest in the names of certain staff, it is not a\n\ncertainty that a corporation would have a commercial interest in the names of every one of its\n\nemployees. Thus, the FCC must state why this information is commercial in nature.\n\n        Further, the FCC has not alleged that the information was “obtained from a person.” For\n\nexample, the name of an SBC staffer in an email sent from FCC staff to SBC staff would not\n\nlikely constitute information “obtained from a person.”\n\n        In any case, the FCC likewise has not shown that the information is confidential.\n\nAlthough the FCC asserts that SBC submitted information to FCC voluntarily, there is some\n\nindication to the contrary. 11 Because of the distinction between the tests for voluntarily versus\n\ninvoluntarily submitted information, the FCC must disclose to the Court whether any\n\ninformation redacted was involuntarily submitted. If voluntarily provided, the FCC must then\n\nshow that the information is “of a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by\n\nthe person from whom it was obtained.” If involuntarily provided, the FCC must show that\n\ndisclosure would impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future\n\nor cause substantial competitive harm to AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The FCC acknowledges that some information may have been submitted in the context of a law enforcement\ninvestigation. It notes that its Letter of Inquiry “required SBC to submit internal documents to the Commission in\nconnection with the FCC’s investigation.” See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. 21 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                       16\n\f                       b.      Other Commercial and Financial Information\n\n       The FCC also invokes Exemption 4 to redact “competitively sensitive information\n\nregarding settlement negotiations” (Documents 14–15, 20, 26), “confidential settlement\n\ninformation,” and SBC’s “competitively sensitive financial information” (Documents 27, 31, 34,\n\n42–44).\n\n       COMPTEL launches various challenges to these redactions. First, it argues that material\n\nprovided and exchanged in settlement negotiation emails between FCC staff and between the\n\nFCC and SBC cannot be withheld under Exemption 4. COMPTEL seems to interpret the FCC’s\n\njustifications for these redactions as proceeding solely from the fact that the information was\n\nexchanged in settlement negotiations. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 20. Second, it alleges that information\n\nredacted from staff notes, draft letters of inquiry, and emails initiated by the FCC cannot be\n\nprotected under Exemption 4 because the information was not “obtained from a person.” Pl.’s\n\nMem P. & A. 19–20; Pl.’s Reply 10 (citing Documents 27, 31, 34, 42–44). Third, COMPTEL\n\nseems to simply argue that the FCC has not met its burden to show that the information meets the\n\nrequirements of Exemption 4.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, to the extent the FCC redacted information under Exemption 4\n\nsolely because it relates to settlement, the Court would reject such a justification. The FCC’s\n\nrationale for its redactions is not entirely clear: its Vaughn index appears to attempt to fit the\n\nredacted information into the traditional requirements of Exemption 4 by labeling it\n\n“competitively sensitive,” yet its declaration often justifies redactions purely on the basis of its\n\nrelation to settlement negotiations. Compare Vaughn Index 12, ECF No. 53-2 (noting redaction\n\nof “[c]ompetitively sensitive financial information”), with Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 21–22\n\n(describing redacted documents as “prepared for settlement negotiations” and “discussing FCC\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fand SBC settlement offers”). Moreover, the FCC states that “information exchanged within the\n\ncontext of settlement negotiations may be properly withheld under Exemption (b)(4)” and that\n\n“documents related to settlement discussions [are] not normally revealed to the public.” Def.’s\n\nMem. P. & A. 12. However, the case cited for the proposition that settlement discussion\n\ninformation may be redacted appears to involve commercial or financial information that would\n\nseparately qualify for Exemption 4 protection. See id. (citing M/A-Com Info. Systems, Inc. v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 656 F. Supp. 691, 692 (D.D.C. 1986) (involving the\n\nredaction of information regarding “certain accounting and other internal procedures” and noting\n\nthat the information was commercial in nature and obtained in confidence)).           Information\n\nregarding settlement negotiations may only qualify for Exemption 4 protection if it is (1)\n\ncommercial or financial information; (2) obtained from a person; and (3) confidential.\n\n       The Court disagrees with COMPTEL that information redacted from staff notes, draft\n\nletters of inquiry, and emails cannot be protected under Exemption 4 because it was not\n\n“obtained from a person.” As stated above, information originally obtained from an outside\n\nsource, but later included in agency documents, may be considered “obtained from a person.”\n\nHowever, the FCC must state in its declarations or Vaughn index that the information was\n\noriginally obtained from SBC or another person.\n\n       More broadly, the Court agrees with COMPTEL that the FCC has failed to meet its\n\nburden to show that redacted information meets the requirements of Exemption 4. For example,\n\nMs. Lancaster’s declaration notes that information was redacted because it would “reveal\n\nprotected information,” a description that is clearly inadequate. See, e.g., Lancaster Suppl. Decl.\n\n¶¶ 18–19, 21–24. While the Vaughn Index is somewhat more detailed, it too fails to provide\n\nsufficient information.   By way of example, the index states that “competitively sensitive\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\finformation regarding settlement negotiations” was redacted from an email chain between FCC\n\nand SBC staff. Vaughn Index 7 (describing redactions from Document 14). These sorts of\n\nconclusory assertions, without any additional description of the contents of the redacted\n\ninformation or reasons for non-disclosure, are insufficient to show that Exemption 4 was\n\nappropriately invoked. Not only do such assertions not demonstrate that the information was\n\n“commercial or financial,” but in many cases the FCC has failed to even allege that the\n\ninformation was confidential or “obtained from a person” (something that is particularly\n\nimportant in documents drafted by FCC). These problems persist throughout the Vaughn Index.\n\n       Again, it may be that the FCC has properly redacted information under Exemption 4.\n\nHowever, the Court lacks sufficient information to make this determination.\n\n               2.     Exemption 5\n\n       The FCC invokes Exemption 5 to redact information from all documents except\n\nDocument 19. Vaughn Index. Exemption 5 shields from disclosure “inter-agency or intra-\n\nagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an\n\nagency in litigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). Exemption 5 “protects only those\n\nmemoranda which would not normally be discoverable in civil litigation against an agency.”\n\nRyan v. Dep’t of Justice, 617 F.2d 781, 790 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (emphasis added). Courts have\n\ninterpreted this to encompass traditional, civil discovery evidentiary privileges, including the\n\nattorney–client privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the executive deliberative\n\nprocess privilege. Taxation With Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 676 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1981); see also Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n\f                          a.       FCC Has Not Demonstrated the Inter- or Intra-Agency Character\n                                   of Some Redacted Documents\n\n         As an initial matter, any information redacted pursuant to Exemption 5 must be either\n\ninter- or intra-agency in nature. Qualifying records include those generated by agencies, but may\n\ninclude opinions and recommendations of outside entities such as consultants if the outside entity\n\ndoes not have its “own . . . interests in mind” and/or is not seeking “a government benefit at the\n\nexpense of other applicants . . . .” Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n,\n\n532 U.S. 1, 9–11, 12 & n.4 (2001). 12\n\n         COMPTEL argues that some records cannot qualify as intra- or inter-agency memoranda.\n\nSpecifically, it asserts that Exemption 5 cannot be used to shield communications with a non-\n\nagency third party.        COMPTEL presumably refers to communications with SBC and the\n\nUniversal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent, not-for-profit corporation\n\nunder the oversight of FCC. 13\n\n         The Court agrees that FCC has not met its burden to show that communications with\n\nSBC or USAC should be considered inter- or intra-agency in nature. The Court doubts, and the\n\nFCC has provided no evidence to the contrary, that communications with SBC could meet the\n\nrequirements for consultant corollary outlined by Klamath and other relevant cases. SBC was\n\n\n12\n  In Klamath, the Supreme Court denied Exemption 5 protection for communications between several Indian tribes\nand the Department of the Interior because the tribes had “their own, albeit entirely legitimate, interests in mind”\nand were “seeking a Government benefit at the expense of other applicants.” Klamath, 532 U.S. at 12 & n.4. Some\ncourts have invoked both factors identified by Klamath (self-interest and pursuit of government benefit) to\ndetermine whether Exemption 5 applies to consultant submissions. See, e.g., Physicians Comm. for Responsible\nMed. v. NIH, 326 F. Supp. 2d 19 (D.D.C. 2004); see also Guide to the Freedom of Information Act 361–62 (U.S.\nDep’t of Justice 2009) (referring to the “two-part test” articulated by Klamath). Others have looked principally to\nthe “degree of self-interest” of the outside entity. See, e.g., Ctr. for Int’l Envtl. Law v. Office of the U.S. Trade\nRepresentative, 237 F. Supp. 2d 17, 27 (D.D.C. 2002); Judicial Watch v. Dep’t of the Army, 435 F. Supp. 2d 81, 92\nn.6 (D.D.C. 2006) (noting that the description of the Klamath factors as a two-part test misstates the holding of\nKlamath because the Supreme Court did not identify a two part test, but two factors that influenced its analysis”).\n13\n  See Vaughn Index (describing Documents 14, 15, 41, 42, 64 (which include emails between FCC staff and SBC\nofficials), Document 65 (an executed tolling agreement between FCC and SBC which appears to have been faxed to\nor from SBC), and Documents 25, 30, 45 (emails between FCC staff and the staff of USAC)).\n\n                                                        20\n\fbeing investigated by the FCC and was not a disinterested third party providing advice to the\n\nagency. While communications with USAC are more likely qualify as inter-agency in nature,\n\nthe FCC must explain why this would be the case.\n\n       For those records that do qualify as inter- or intra-agency, the next step is to determine\n\nwhether they would be unavailable to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,\n\nfor example through a traditional privilege.\n\n                      b.      Attorney–Client Privilege\n\n       The FCC invokes Exemption 5 to protect information that it asserts would be protected\n\nunder the attorney–client privilege. Vaughn Index (invoking privilege for Documents 6–7, 10–\n\n11, 14–15, 16, 22–24, 26–29, 47–49). That privilege protects “confidential communications\n\nbetween an attorney and his client relating to a legal matter for which the client has sought\n\nprofessional advice,” Mead Data Ctr., 566 F.2d at 252, and does not extend to facts provided by\n\nan attorney that do not reflect client confidences, Brinton v. Dep’t of State, 636 F.2d 600, 603\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1980). In general, an agency must demonstrate the confidentiality of communications\n\nsought to be protected by Exemption 5 and the Court cannot assume confidentiality. Mead Data\n\nCtr., 566 F.2d at 254. Finally, the privilege is to be narrowly construed, Coastal States Gas\n\nCorp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C. Cir. 1980), and “‘protects only those\n\ndisclosures necessary to obtain informed legal advice which might not have been made absent\n\nthe privilege.’” Id. (quoting Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976)).\n\n       COMPTEL argues that the FCC has not shown “that the attorney–client privilege protects\n\nany of the redacted materials because it has not shown that any of the documents contain\n\nconfidential information communicated to an attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fPl.’s Reply 7. It reiterates that the agency bears the burden to establish confidentiality. Id.\n\n(citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 863).\n\n       The FCC has done nothing to show that material for which the attorney–client privilege\n\nwas invoked involved confidential communications or that it related to a legal matter for which\n\nthe client sought legal advice. Again, as the D.C. Circuit noted in Coastal States, conclusory\n\nassertions of privilege will not suffice to carry the Government’s burden of proof in defending\n\nFOIA cases. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 861. The Circuit noted in that case,\n\n       The parties have referred to these materials as the Government’s “Vaughn Index,”\n       but we wish to make clear that this index is not what we had in mind in our\n       decision in Vaughn . . . . A typical line from the index supplied in this case\n       identifies who wrote the memorandum, to whom it was addressed, its date, [] a\n       brief description of the memorandum [, and a] claim[ that the] document was\n       “PD” (predecisional), “ATWP” (attorney work-product) . . . . Such an index is\n       patently inadequate.\n\n       Id.\n\n       The index submitted by the FCC is quite similar to that rejected by the D.C. Circuit in\n\nCoastal States in that it merely identifies who wrote the memorandum, includes a brief\n\ndescription, and claims that it represents attorney–client material.\n\n       In addition to not sufficiently supporting its assertions of confidentiality, the information\n\nsubmitted by FCC sometimes suggests an absence of confidentiality. For example, the FCC\n\nseeks to protect “attorney–client discussions” in an email chain between FCC staff and SBC\n\nofficials. However, information shared with outside entities would no longer be confidential.\n\nSee Mead Data Ctr., 566 F.2d at 255 (noting that a document setting forth the background and\n\nnegotiations with a publishing company may not reflect confidential communications given that\n\nmuch of the information would also be known to the publishing company itself). While it is\n\npossible that some of these discussions were in emails on which SBC officials had been\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fremoved, the FCC does not provide the Court with sufficient information with which to\n\ndetermine that.\n\n                          c.       Attorney Work-Product Privilege\n\n        The FCC has also invoked the attorney work-product privilege to redact information from\n\nor fully withhold Documents 4–7, 10, 13–14, 17–18, 20–21, 24, 26–27, 28–29, 31, 34, 44, 47–\n\n49, 50, and 51–64. The work-product privilege protects documents prepared in anticipation of\n\nlitigation by a party or its attorneys and applies to both deliberative materials such as mental\n\nimpressions, conclusions, opinions, and legal theories, and to factual materials prepared in\n\nanticipation of litigation. See Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510 (1947); see also Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 26(b)(3); Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607, 620 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The privilege is not\n\nlimited to civil litigation but includes administrative proceedings as well. Schoenman v. FBI,\n\n573 F. Supp. 2d 119, 143 (D.D.C. 2008). Attorney work product is exempt from mandatory\n\ndisclosure regardless of whether the litigation for which it was prepared has ended or was never\n\nbrought. FTC v. Grolier Inc., 462 U.S. 19, 28 (1983). The privilege also applies to settlement\n\ndiscussions and work product prepared to avoid possible litigation. Cities Serv. Co. v. FTC, 627\n\nF. Supp. 827, 832 (D.D.C. 1984).\n\n        COMPTEL argues that the FCC has not met its burden to show that redacted materials\n\nwere attorney work product. 14 Many of the documents for which the privilege is invoked appear\n\nto have been prepared by an attorney during the course of the investigation into SBC, or\n\nimmediately thereafter as the FCC contemplated additional enforcement actions.\n\n\n\n\n14\n  As an example, COMPTEL cites Document 30 as an example of an unreasonable invocation of the work-product\nprivilege because the FCC does not list the parties to the email. However, the Vaughn index does not appear to\nassert attorney work-product privilege for this document, unless the reference to “legal analysis” is intended as a\nreference to the work-product privilege.\n\n                                                        23\n\f       The Court notes that the requirements of the work-product doctrine are more easily met\n\nthan those for the attorney–client privilege. The FCC need only demonstrate that the materials\n\nwere prepared in anticipation of litigation and need not segregate deliberative from factual\n\nmaterial. However, the FCC must identify the nexus between the documents and any potential\n\nlitigation or settlement thereof. Again, the FCC relies on fairly conclusory assertions of the\n\nprivilege here.    See, e.g., Vaughn Index (describing redactions from Document 34 as\n\n“[h]andwritten notes of Dave Janas, FCC staff attorney, containing deliberative process attorney\n\nwork product analysis of SBC invoices”); id. (describing redactions from Document 13 as\n\n“[h]andwritten attorney work product note of Dave Janas, FCC staff attorney, containing SBC\n\nstaff contact information and statement memorializing a request from the person”); id.\n\n(describing redactions from Document 14 as “an attorney work product analysis by Dave Janas,\n\nFCC staff attorney, of SBC submissions . . . .”). While the Court assumes that the FCC can meet\n\nits burden given the nature of the investigation and settlement discussions at issue, the FCC must\n\nprovide somewhat more detail in order for the Court to make this determination.\n\n                      d.      Deliberative Process Privilege\n\n       The deliberative process privilege encompasses “recommendations and deliberations\n\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.”\n\nKlamath, 532 U.S. at 8–9 (quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). The general purpose of the privilege is to “prevent injury to\n\nthe quality of agency decisions.” Sears, Roebuck, 421 U.S. at 151.\n\n       The privilege protects agency documents that are both “predecisional and deliberative.”\n\nJudicial Watch v. FDA, 449 F.3d at 151. A document is predecisional if “‘it was generated\n\nbefore the adoption of an agency policy.’” Judicial Watch v. FDA, 449 F.3d at 151 (quoting\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 866). Materials do not lose their predecisional status once a final\n\ndecision is made. See Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. DHS, 384 F. Supp. 2d 100, 112–13 (D.D.C.\n\n2005) (“[I]t is the document’s role in the agency’s decision-making process that controls.”).\n\nAdditionally, records generated after adoption of a particular agency policy may still be\n\npredecisional with respect to other nonfinal agency policies. See, e.g., Judicial Watch v. FDA,\n\n449 F.3d at 152 (noting that documents dated after a drug’s approval could still be predecisional\n\nwith respect to other policies, including uses of the drug the agency had not approved).\n\n       A document is “deliberative” if “‘it reflects the give-and-take of the consultative\n\nprocess.’” Id. (quoting Coastal States Gas, 617 F.2d at 866). D.C. Circuit interpretations of this\n\nrequirement “have focused on whether disclosure of the requested material would tend to\n\n‘discourage candid discussion within an agency.’” Petroleum Info. Corp. v. U.S. Dept. of\n\nInterior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The first step in the inquiry into whether a\n\nrecord was deliberative “‘is to examine the context in which the materials are used.’” Id. (citing\n\nWolfe v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 839 F.2d 768, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).               Non-\n\ndeliberative, factual portions of a document must segregated and disclosed. Petroleum Info.\n\nCorp., 976 F.2d at 1434.\n\n       COMPTEL opposes the FCC’s use of the deliberative process privilege for four reasons.\n\nFirst, it believes the FCC has withheld certain materials pursuant to Exemption 5 solely because\n\nthey relate to settlement discussions and argues that there is “no federal settlement privilege.”\n\nThe Court is not certain that the FCC invokes a federal settlement privilege. Instead, it seems to\n\nargue that the documents include predecisional, deliberative materials shielded under Exemption\n\n5. See Def.’s Opp’n 14–15. Specifically, the FCC only asserts that documents “related to the\n\nFCC’s evaluation of the merits of settling with SBC” would be exempt from disclosure. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f(emphasis added). However, the FCC’s Vaughn index is not sufficiently detailed for the Court to\n\nensure that the documents meet both the predecisional and deliberativeness requirements, thus\n\nthe FCC will need to supplement its filings to address these requirements.\n\n       Second, with respect to documents post-dating the consent decree for which the FCC has\n\ninvoked the deliberative process privilege, COMPTEL argues that the documents cannot be\n\nconsidered “predecisional.”    See Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 24. It also argues that any documents\n\nreflecting the FCC’s decision not to pursue other causes of action or reflecting resolution of an\n\nissue must be produced because they are not predecisional. Id. at 26–27. The Court disagrees.\n\nA document may post-date one decision but still be predecisional with respect to another\n\ndecision. However, again, the FCC has the burden to show the documents’ predecisional nature.\n\n       Third, COMPTEL suggests that FCC may not have segregated non-deliberative, factual\n\nmaterials. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 34. In support, COMPTEL points to documents 47 through 49\n\nwhich, it states, were redacted in their entirety.     However, the FCC invoked not only the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, but the attorney work-product privilege to protect material in these\n\ndocuments.     “If a document is fully protected as work product, then segregability is not\n\nrequired” because that privilege does not distinguish between factual and deliberative materials.\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 432 F.3d 366, 371 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Nevertheless, the\n\nagency must show that the document itself is fully protected as work product and then must state\n\nthat it considered whether non-protected material could be segregated. It has not done so.\n\n       Finally, COMPTEL seems to argue generally that the FCC has not met its burden to show\n\nthat certain documents are deliberative. As the Court has already stated, it agrees that the FCC\n\nhas not provided sufficient detail with which to evaluate its claims of deliberative privilege. For\n\nexample, with respect to Document 20, the FCC notes that it has redacted “[a]ttorney–client,\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fdeliberative process e-mail containing attorney work product analysis of SBC investigation\n\nevidence, recommendations regarding future actions and a request for approval of settlement\n\nprovision.” Vaughn Index 10. Not only does this label join three distinct privileges without\n\nseparately providing support for each, but it gives too little detail regarding the agency’s\n\njustification for invoking the deliberative privilege. Similarly, the FCC describes the redactions\n\nin Document 46 as “a deliberative process comment by FCC staff regarding a TR Daily story\n\nabout Sprint and the E-Rate program.” Finally, in at least one case, the redaction of a 3-page\n\nemail chain in Document 34, the FCC does not even identify which privilege has been invoked\n\nto protect redacted information.\n\n        In short, the FCC has not met its burden to show the applicability of Exemption 5. Bare\n\nand conclusory assertions of the privilege are not sufficient.\n\n                 3.       Exemption 6\n\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 6 to redact the names and work contact information of\n\nFCC, DOJ, USAC, and SBC staff. 15\n\n        Since filing for summary judgment, the FCC has allegedly released the names of some\n\nSBC/AT&T staff and one FCC staff-level employee to conform with the FCC’s Memorandum\n\nOpinion and Order in In the Matter of Comptel. Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info. (citing\n\nF.C.C. 12-64, 2012 WL 2354823, at *5 (June 19, 2012)). These appear to have originally been\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6 and 7(C). The FCC’s Memorandum and Order held that the\n\nredactions were erroneous because these employees had already been publicly connected with\n\nthe investigation. COMPTEL now disputes whether the FCC has released the information\n\n15\n  Specifically it redacts the names, office addresses and/or room numbers, telephone and fax numbers, email\naddresses, website information, and employer name of FCC and/or DOJ staff (Documents 1–12, 14–20, 22–26, 28–\n30, 32–50, 64–65); the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and office room numbers of USAC staff\n(Documents 25, 30, 32–34, 45); and the names, email addresses, job titles and descriptions, office phone numbers,\nand work departments of SBC staff (Documents 31, 33–34, 40–44, 64).\n\n                                                       27\n\frequired by the FCC Memorandum and Order. See Pl.’s Reply to Release. The FCC has not\n\nprovided an amended Vaughn index by which the Court can evaluate these claims. The FCC\n\nshould revise its Vaughn index to provide the Court with this information.\n\n       Because the Vaughn index and declaration are insufficient in other ways with respect to\n\nExemption 6, the Court outlines those deficiencies below so that the FCC may supplement its\n\nfilings and the parties may re-file for summary judgment.\n\n       Exemption 6 protects from disclosure “personnel and medical files and similar files the\n\ndisclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). “Similar files” are interpreted broadly and are intended to cover “‘detailed\n\nGovernment records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.’”\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 600, 602 (1982). “When disclosure of\n\ninformation which applies to a particular individual is sought from Government records, courts\n\nmust determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\ninvasion of that person’s privacy.” Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. at 602.\n\n       If a record constitutes a personnel, medical, or similar file, the court must determine if\n\ndisclosure “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Wash Post.\n\nCo. 456 U.S. at 598. “To establish that the release of information contained in government files\n\nwould result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, the court first asks whether disclosure\n\n‘would compromise a substantial, as opposed to a de minimis, privacy interest,’” Nat’l Ass’n of\n\nHome Builders, 309 F.3d at 33 (quoting Horner, 879 F.2d at 874), though that standard is “not\n\nvery demanding,” Multi Ag Media LLC v. USDA, 515 F.3d 1224, 1229–30 (D.C. Cir. 2008). If\n\nthere is more than a de minimis privacy interest, the court must then weigh the interest against\n\nany public interest in disclosure. Horner, 879 F.2d at 874. The public interest in question is “the\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fextent to which disclosure would serve the core purposes of the FOIA” by “contributing\n\nsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.” U. S.\n\nDep’t of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 495 (1994) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n       COMPTEL argues that the FCC has not met its burden to show that the disclosure of\n\nnames and other information would result in “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\nPl.’s Mem. P. & A. 14. With respect to government employees, it argues that their names are not\n\npersonal information in which they have a protected privacy interest, noting that their names and\n\nduty stations are available to the public and that names, phone numbers, and email addresses of\n\nFCC employees are available on the FCC’s website. Id. at 14–15.\n\n       Because courts have broadly defined what constitutes a “similar” file under Exemption 4\n\nto include information that applies to a particular individual, see supra, the documents referenced\n\nare likely to constitute “similar files.”   However, any privacy interests at stake will vary\n\ndepending on the individuals identified. With respect to SBC employees, for example, the Court\n\nassumes that there is likely more than a de minimis privacy interest in the employees’ names and\n\ncontact information.    This is particularly the case where the individuals may have been\n\nresponding to allegations of potential wrongdoing by their employer, SBC.\n\n       However, it is less likely that employees of USAC, FCC, and DOJ would have\n\nsubstantial privacy interests. A number of courts have considered the applicability of Exemption\n\n6 to government employees though their treatment does not appear to be particularly uniform.\n\nSee, e.g., Aguirre v. SEC, 551 F. Supp. 2d 33, 54 (D.D.C. 2008) (“Correspondence does not\n\nbecome personal solely because it identifies government employees.”); but see Lahr v. NTSB,\n\n569 F.3d 964, 973–79 (9th Cir. 2009) (recognizing, in response to agency arguments, that FBI\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fagents have an interest in keeping private their involvement in especially controversial events).\n\n“[I]nformation that ‘merely identifies the names of government officials who authored\n\ndocuments and received documents’ does not generally fall within Exemption 6.” Aguirre, 551\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 53 (quoting VoteHemp, Inc. v. DEA, No. 02–cv–985 (RBW), slip op. at 12\n\n(D.D.C. Oct. 15, 2004)). Furthermore, the names of FCC staff are available through a search\n\nfunction on the FCC’s website that allows one to generate a list of all of the individuals who\n\nwork in EB along with their work telephone numbers and email addresses. The public nature of\n\nthis information weakens the FCC’s claim.            Nevertheless, the Court acknowledges that\n\ngovernment and USAC employees might have a more than de minimis privacy interest in\n\ninformation that not only identifies them, but links them to work on a particular investigation.\n\n       However, whatever hypothetical privacy interests the Court may imagine, the FCC has\n\nnot met its burden to show that Exemption 6 was appropriately invoked. The FCC suggests that\n\nnames, office addresses, job titles, work phone numbers, etc. are “personal and private\n\nidentifying information” in which “individuals have an expectation of privacy.” Def.’s Mem. P.\n\n& A. 18–20. However, the FCC’s Vaughn index does nothing more than restate the law and its\n\ndeclaration does not even address the redactions made pursuant to either Exemption 6 or\n\nExemption 7(C).     See, e.g., Vaughn Index 3 (describing redactions from Document 5 as\n\n“personal and private Identifying information (names, name of employer) of FCC and DOJ\n\nGov’t staff”). While courts often uphold the redaction of personal identifying information under\n\nExemption 6, the agency must at least provide the Court with some basis for such an interest.\n\nThis is particularly the case with respect to USAC, FCC, and DOJ staff since these individuals\n\nwere engaged in performance of their official duties, not targets of any investigation, and may be\n\nat less risk for embarrassment, harassment, or unwanted contacts, etc. While the Court can\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fimagine situations in which a privacy interest might exist because of these individuals’ roles in\n\nthe FCC investigation, the FCC has not provided any such justification.\n\n        On the other hand, COMPTEL has not asserted any public interest in disclosure of these\n\nnames. If the FCC shows a privacy interest in non-disclosure, COMPTEL cannot survive\n\nsummary judgment without identifying a public interest in disclosure. “[S]omething, even a\n\nmodest privacy interest, outweighs nothing every time.” Horner, 879 F.2d at 879.\n\n        Finally, because the FCC has allegedly released the names of certain individuals that it\n\nerroneously withheld, the Court has no way of knowing which names the agency plans to redact\n\nat this time. The agency should submit a revised Vaughn index to reflect the most recent release\n\nof information along with any asserted privacy interests.\n\n                 4.      Exemption 7(C)\n\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 7(C) to protect names and contact information of SBC,\n\nUSAC, and FCC staff and FCC interns and other individuals in “law enforcement documents.” 16\n\n        Exemption 7(C) protects from disclosure “records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records\n\nor information . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(7)(C).\n\n        Records compiled for law enforcement purposes may relate to either criminal or civil\n\nmatters. Rural Hous. Alliance v. USDA, 498 F.2d 73, 81 & n.46 (D.C. Cir. 1974). A “law\n\nenforcement purpose exists where there is a rational nexus between the compiled document and a\n\nlaw enforcement duty of the agency and where there is a connection between an individual or\n\n\n16\n  Specifically, the FCC redacts the names, work departments, work phone numbers, email addresses, and employer\nnames of SBC staff (Document 13–15, 33–34, 40–44, 64); the names and email addresses of USAC staff members\n(Document 25, 30–32, 34, 45); the names and email address of FCC staff and interns (Document 32); and the names\nand email addresses of “individuals” in “law enforcement documents” (Documents 19–20).\n\n                                                      31\n\fincident and a possible . . . violation of federal law.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 337 F. Supp. 2d 146, 179 (D.D.C. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nAgencies with both law enforcement and non-law enforcement functions (“mixed-function”\n\nagencies) must satisfy a higher standard to show that records involve law enforcement. Pratt v.\n\nWebster, 673 F.2d 408, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n\n        Once records or information are shown to have been compiled for law enforcement,\n\ncourts perform a balancing test similar to, those less demanding than, that for Exemption 6. See\n\nComputer Prof’ls for Soc. Responsibility v. U.S. Secret Serv., 72 F.3d 897, 904 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nUnlike the Exemption 6 requirement that disclosure “would” constitute a “clearly unwarranted”\n\ninvasion of privacy, Exemption 7(C) only requires that disclosure “could reasonably be expected\n\nto” constitute an “unwarranted” invasion of privacy. See Martin v. Dep’t of Justice, 488 F.3d\n\n446, 456–57 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Thus, “privacy interests are particularly difficult to overcome\n\nwhen law enforcement information about third parties is implicated.” Id. at 457.\n\n        COMPTEL does not generally dispute that the documents for which Exemption 7(C) is\n\ninvoked were compiled for law enforcement purposes. However, it argues that the names of\n\nFCC and DOJ staff who worked on the SBC investigation and the names of AT&T counsel who\n\nauthored or received copies of correspondence related to the investigation were not compiled for\n\nlaw enforcement purposes. Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. 17.; Pl.’s Reply 11. 17\n\n        There are two problems with this argument. First, the FCC does not appear to invoke\n\nExemption 7(C) to protect the names of any DOJ staff. In fact, Exemption 7(C) is invoked in\n\nonly one document to justify redaction of the names of FCC staff and interns. Additionally, the\n\nCourt cannot confirm whether FCC redacted the names of AT&T counsel under Exemption 7(C).\n\n17\n  The Court cannot confirm that the names of AT&T counsel were redacted by the FCC. COMPTEL does not point\nthe Court to a particular document number or assertion in the FCC Declaration or Vaughn index.\n\n                                                   32\n\f       Second, COMPTEL misconstrues the inquiry into whether names may be redacted under\n\nExemption 7(C). While the names at issue may not have been compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes, if they are contained in records compiled for law enforcement purposes they may be\n\nredacted. See, e.g., United Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, 667 F. Supp. 2d 49, 59-60 (D.D.C. 2009)\n\n(considering whether names of OIG employees in OIG emails could be redacted and concluding\n\nthat the emails fall within FOIA’s law enforcement purposes requirement).\n\n       COMPTEL only requested documents related to the investigation of SBC’s possible\n\nviolations of federal law. See Pl.’s SMF ¶ 2 (describing the request for documents related to\n\npossible violations by SBC of the Commission’s rules). Courts have previously upheld treatment\n\nof FCC investigatory files as law enforcement records. See, e.g., Kay v. FCC, 867 F. Supp. 11\n\n(D.D.C. 1994). Here, the documents all appear include a connection between a particular entity\n\nor incident and a possible violation of federal law. Thus, all of the documents for which\n\nExemption 7(C) protection was sought appear to have been compiled for law enforcement.\n\n       Nevertheless, COMPTEL argues, and the Court agrees, that the FCC has not shown that\n\ndisclosure of the redacted information could reasonably be expected to result in an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy for all individuals involved. While the FCC is correct that courts often\n\nuphold the redaction of the names of individuals identified in law enforcement records, including\n\nthe names of government employees, the FCC must do more than simply assert that these\n\nindividuals “have a clear expectation of privacy,” Def.’s Mem. P. & A. 22. For example, courts\n\nhave upheld the redaction of the names of government employees performing their official duties\n\nwhen the disclosure of their names might results in harassment, intimidation, or attempts to\n\nunduly influence, or obtain information about, the employees’ work. In Concepcion v. FBI, 606\n\nF. Supp. 2d 14 (D.D.C. 2009), the court upheld redaction of the names of FBI Special Agents\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fbecause, if their “identities were disclosed, they may be subjected to ‘unnecessary, unofficial\n\nquestioning regarding this and/or other investigations, whether or not they are currently\n\nemployed by the FBI.’ In addition, ‘publicity associated with the release of [a Special Agent’s]\n\nidentity in connection with a particular law enforcement investigation could rekindle animosity\n\ntoward that [Special Agent]’ on the part of persons targeted or otherwise affected by law\n\nenforcement action involving the agent.” Concepcion, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 38 (quoting agency’s\n\ndeclaration). The court also upheld the redaction of the names of support personnel because they\n\n“‘were, and possibly are, in positions to access information regarding official law enforcement\n\ninvestigations,’ [and] ‘could become targets of harassing inquiries for unauthorized access to\n\ninvestigations if their identities were released.’” Id. (quoting agency’s declaration). However,\n\nthe court relied on the sworn declarations provided by the agency identifying these privacy\n\nconcerns.   Here, the FCC merely restates the legal standard for Exemption 7(C).           This is\n\ninsufficient to support summary judgment. See United Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, 667 F. Supp. 2d\n\n49, 60 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Neither of the . . . declarations . . . establish that the investigators and\n\ninspectors have a privacy interest . . . . [A]n agency must at least explain the ground for\n\nconcluding that there is some factual basis for concerns about harassment, intimidation, or\n\nphysical harm.” (internal quotation marks omitted))).\n\n       On the other hand, COMPTEL has made no showing of any public interest in disclosure.\n\nThus, as with the Exemption 6 analysis, COMPTEL will fail on summary judgment if the FCC\n\ncan show any privacy interest at all.\n\n       Finally, the FCC’s June 2012 Memorandum and Order required the release of names of\n\ncertain SBC/AT&T and FCC employees whose names were erroneously redacted under\n\nExemption 7(C). The FCC has not revised its Vaughn index or declaration to account for this\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fdisclosure. As a result, the Court cannot know in which documents the FCC invokes Exemption\n\n7(C).\n\n        In summary, the FCC must amend its Vaughn index to account for the deficiencies\n\nidentified above. While it is possible that the FCC can show that it appropriately redacted\n\ninformation pursuant to Exemption 7(C), as well as Exemptions 4, 5, and 6, the FCC cannot rely\n\non bare and conclusory assertions to demonstrate this. Accordingly, the FCC should submit a\n\nrevised Vaughn index and declaration.\n\n        D.     Declaratory Judgment Analysis\n\n        COMPTEL seeks a declaratory judgment that the FCC has violated the FOIA and that its\n\n“pattern and practice” of delays in disclosing material to COMPTEL is unlawful and\n\nunreasonable. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 1, 6. It also seeks a finding that the FCC’s failure to disclose\n\nthe volume of material withheld violates FOIA. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 6.\n\n        While FOIA does not specifically provide for declaratory relief, the Act “imposes no\n\nlimits on courts’ equitable powers in enforcing its terms.” Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States,\n\n837 F.2d 486, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citing Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415\n\nU.S. 1, 19-20 (1974).    However, “a declaration that an agency’s initial refusal to disclose\n\nrequested information was unlawful, after the agency made that information available, would\n\nconstitute an advisory opinion in contravention of Article III of the Constitution.”       Payne\n\nEnters., 837 F.2d at 491 (citing Better Gov’t Ass’n v. Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86, 91 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1986)). A party whose FOIA request has been satisfied, however, may seek declaratory relief if\n\nan “agency policy or practice will impair the party’s lawful access to information in the future.”\n\nId. (citing Better Gov’t Ass’n, 780 F.2d at 90–92). The D.C. Circuit in Payne found that the\n\ndistrict court had abused its discretion in refusing to grant declaratory relief. In that case,\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fofficers at Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) bases had refused to fulfill a FOIA request\n\neven after the Secretary of the Air Force admonished AFLC officials for their failure to act.\n\nPayne Enters., 837 F.2d at 494.\n\n       Here, the Court denies without prejudice the parties’ motions for summary and the parties\n\nmay refile their motions to address the issues identified in this opinion. As a result, it is possible\n\nthat COMPTEL’s FOIA request may be satisfied through summary judgment. It would be\n\ninappropriate for the Court to issue declaratory relief that the FCC has violated the FOIA when\n\nthe Court lacks sufficient information to make this determination.\n\n       Furthermore, the Court is doubtful that it could find that the FCC’s failure to disclose the\n\nvolume of material withheld is a violation of the FOIA. COMPTEL’s request for such a finding\n\nis based on the fact that the FCC, in a single email in 2005, suggested that there might be 3200\n\npages of “potentially responsive” documents. However, as the Court understands the parties’\n\nmotions for summary judgment, they are based on COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request. According\n\nto COMPTEL itself, that request sought the information identified as responsive in the FCC’s\n\ndeclarations with this Court (approximately 500–550 pages of material). Thus, by COMPTEL’s\n\nreasoning, there is no reason for the FCC to account for 2600 pages of “missing” material,\n\nbecause COMPTEL has sought only about 500–550 pages. Even if more material would be\n\nresponsive to the 2007 request, the Court cannot base a finding that the FCC has wrongfully\n\nwithheld 2600 pages of material on a single 2005 email. The FCC’s three sworn declarations\n\nsince that time have never cited more than approximately 550 pages of responsive material.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies without prejudice the parties’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment. The Court finds that the FCC has not demonstrated that it conducted an\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fadequate search in response to COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request. Even if the search had been\n\nshown to be adequate, the FCC has not met its burden to demonstrate, with respect to each\n\ndocument withheld or redacted, that it properly invoked any applicable exemptions and\n\nsegregated information to which an exemption did not apply. As a result, the Court denies\n\nwithout prejudice the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. The FCC shall submit a\n\nrevised Vaughn index and declaration no later than 30 days from today. As appropriate, the\n\nparties will have twenty days from the date of submission of the Vaughn index and declaration to\n\nsubmit new motions for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n       Signed by Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, on December 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f",

Before the Court are\n\nplaintiff COMPTEL’s [52] and defendant FCC’s [53] Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. 1\n\nIn general, COMPTEL seeks an order enjoining the FCC from withholding the records it\n\nrequested and compelling the FCC to produce unredacted versions of those records, and a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the FCC has violated the FOIA. The FCC seeks a judgment that it\n\nconducted a reasonable search, produced all responsive documents, and properly withheld\n\ninformation under statutory FOIA exemptions.\n\n\n1\n  COMPTEL submitted a Memorandum [52] of Points and Authorities in Support of Summary Judgment, ECF No.\n52, but not a formal motion for summary judgment. However, given that defendant FCC filed an Opposition to the\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities and COMPTEL filed a Reply, the Court deems the Memorandum a motion\nfor summary judgment. In addition to the parties’ cross motions, the Court considered the following filings, and\ntheir attached exhibits: COMPTEL’s Statement [52-1] of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute;\nFCC’s Opposition [54] to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment; COMPTEL’s Reply [56] to Defendant’s\nOpposition to COMPTEL’s Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Memorandum [53] of Points and Authorities in\nSupport of its Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Statement [53-1] of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute\nand the attached Supplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster and Vaughn Index [53-2]; COMPTEL’s Opposition\n[55] to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment; FCC’s Reply [57] in Support of its Motion for Summary\nJudgment; the FCC’s Notice [58] of Supplemental Release of Information; and COMPTEL’s Reply [59] to\nDefendant’s Notice of Supplemental Release of Information.\n\f       The Court cannot grant summary judgment to either party at this time. First, there is a\n\nfactual dispute as to whether the FCC conducted a search in response to COMPTEL’s most\n\nrecent FOIA request. More importantly, the FCC has not demonstrated that it conducted an\n\nadequate search in response to that request. This alone precludes summary judgment for the\n\nFCC. However, even if the FCC had demonstrated that it conducted an adequate search, the\n\nagency has not provided sufficient detail regarding its justifications for withholding certain\n\ninformation under various FOIA exemptions. As the D.C. Circuit has reiterated numerous times,\n\nagencies cannot rely on “conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions,” as it has done\n\nhere. Finally, in response to an administrative order, the FCC released additional responsive\n\ninformation to COMPTEL after the pending motions for summary judgment were filed and ripe.\n\nHowever, the FCC has not amended its submissions to the Court to account for this release and\n\nthe parties appear to disagree about whether the FCC has satisfied its obligations under the\n\nadministrative order. Because the Court cannot determine which information has now been\n\nreleased and which withheld, it cannot evaluate the FCC’s remaining redactions.\n\n       Although the FCC has not met its burden for summary judgment, the Court also lacks\n\nsufficient information by which to grant summary judgment for COMPTEL. As is often the\n\npractice with FOIA cases in which the record is not sufficiently developed, the Court will DENY\n\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE the parties’ motions.              The FCC is directed to file an amended\n\ndeclaration and Vaughn index to address the issues identified in this Opinion. Upon submission\n\nof the revised declaration and index, the parties may re-file their cross-motions, as appropriate.\n\nA separate Order consistent with this Opinion shall issue this date.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fI.      BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        COMPTEL is a non-profit trade association whose members are communications service\n\nproviders and their supplier partners. Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 52\n\n[hereinafter Pl.’s Mem P. & A.]. COMPTEL first filed an electronic FOIA request with the FCC\n\nin April 2005. Although COMPTEL has not provided the Court with a copy of the request, the\n\nparties agree that it sought “all pleadings and correspondence” contained in File No. EB-04-IH-\n\n0342, which was opened by the FCC Enforcement Bureau (“EB”) to investigate SBC\n\nCommunications, Inc., now AT&T. 2 Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶¶ 1–2, ECF No. 52-1 [hereinafter\n\nPl.’s SMF]; Def.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts in Opp’n to Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts ¶¶ 1–2. In August 2004,\n\nthe SBC had voluntarily reported to the FCC that it may have violated the Commission’s rules in\n\nconnection with SBC’s receipt of universal service funds for Connecticut public schools under\n\nthe E-Rate, or Education-Rate program. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 2. As part of the EB’s subsequent\n\ninvestigation, SBC provided the FCC with a variety of documents which included cost and\n\npricing data, billing and payment dates, and other information. Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4, July\n\n25, 2012, ECF No. 53-2. The FCC terminated its investigation in December 2004 upon issuing\n\nan Order adopting a Consent Decree. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 3.\n\n        After COMPTEL requested records of the investigation, SBC sought confidential\n\ntreatment, under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 7(C), of the materials it provided to the FCC. Pl.’s\n\nSMF ¶ 4. The FCC then notified COMPTEL via email that it was reviewing about 3200 pages\n\nof documents “potentially responsive” to the FOIA request. Id., Ex. 2.\n\n\n\n\n2\n SBC merged with AT&T in November 2005. The Court and the parties alternatively refer to that corporate entity\nas SBC or AT&T depending on the time period at issue.\n\n                                                      3\n\f        In August 2005, the FCC granted in part and denied in part COMPTEL’s FOIA request.\n\nIn response to SBC’s request for confidential treatment, the FCC agreed to withhold certain\n\ninformation in SBC submissions pursuant to Exemption 4, including “costs and pricing data,\n\n[SBC’s] billing and payment dates, and identifying information of SBC’s staff, contractors, and\n\nthe representatives of its contractors and customers.” Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4. The FCC also\n\nwithheld the names of individuals identified in SBC’s submissions pursuant to Exemptions 6 and\n\n7(C), and drafts of EB “pleadings and correspondence, and internal memoranda and emails\n\ndiscussing the SBC investigation” pursuant to Exemption 5. Id. The FCC stated that it would\n\nrelease any non-exempt documents to COMPTEL within ten days if AT&T failed to file an\n\napplication for review with the FCC’s Office of General Counsel. Pl’s SMF ¶ 9. Both AT&T\n\nand COMPTEL timely filed applications for review. Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n        The FCC failed to act on the applications for review within the 20-day statutory period, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(G)(6)(A)(ii), and COMPTEL filed this action on October 5, 2006 to enjoin\n\nthe FCC from withholding the documents requested. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 11; Compl., ECF No. 1.\n\nAT&T intervened and cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by all parties in February\n\n2007. When the FCC argued that COMPTEL had waived its request for certain documents,\n\nCOMPTEL filed a second FOIA request on April 16, 2007 for all documents “referenced in the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster [and] all correspondence with any third party\n\ncontained in FCC Case file no. EB-04-IH-0342.” See In the Matter of COMPTEL, 27 F.C.C.R.\n\n7705, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2354823</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (June 19, 2012). This 2007 FOIA request appears to be the only\n\nrequest at issue in the pending cross-motions. At least in theory, though, it should have resulted\n\nin a response that is at least co-extensive with a response to the 2005 request. 3\n\n\n3\n  The FCC asserts that the 2007 request is the subject of these cross-motions, Def.’s MSJ 5, and COMPTEL appears\nto agree, focusing almost all of its arguments on 193 pages of documents provided in response to that request.\n\n                                                       4\n\f        Because the FCC administrative review process remained pending, Judge Kennedy, then\n\nassigned to the case, denied without prejudice the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment\n\nand stayed the case until final agency action was completed. ECF No. 32; Minute Order, Mar. 5,\n\n2008. The FCC later denied AT&T’s application for review, finding that Exemption 7(C) may\n\nprotect the personal privacy interests of individuals identified in law enforcement documents, but\n\nnot the privacy interests of corporations. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 17. AT&T appealed to the Third Circuit\n\nwhich ruled for them. AT&T v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1348940\"><a href=\"/opinion/1348940/at-t-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3rd Cir. 2009). In March 2011, the\n\nSupreme Court reversed, holding that Exemption 7(C) does not protect privacy interests of\n\ncorporations and that AT&T could not invoke the exemption to shield documents provided to\n\nFCC during the investigation. FCC v. AT&T,131 S. Ct. 1177 (2011). When the FCC failed to\n\nrelease documents to COMPTEL after this decision, COMPTEL filed, and the Court granted, a\n\nmotion to lift the stay in the instant litigation.\n\n        The FCC has given varying estimates of the number of pages of material responsive to\n\nCOMPTEL’s FOIA request. While an early FCC email response to COMPTEL identified 3200\n\npages of “potentially responsive” documents, the FCC later significantly reduced this estimate.\n\nAt the time of the 2007 cross-motions for summary judgment, the FCC estimated that there were\n\napproximately 508–544 pages of responsive documents, including 191–237 pages which the\n\nFCC planned to withhold under Exemption 5.\n\n        On June 3, 2011, the FCC sent COMPTEL 362 pages of redacted documents, which\n\nappear to include all of the information for which Exemption 5 was not invoked, along with\n\n\n\n\nHowever, COMPTEL also repeatedly refers to a statement made by the FCC in response to COMPTEL’s 2005\nrequest that the FCC had identified 3200 pages of potentially responsive documents. Thus, the Court is unsure\nwhether COMPTEL continues to challenge the adequacy of the search conducted in response to the 2005 request.\n\n                                                     5\n\ffifteen pages of material that had been identified as protected by Exemption 5. 4 On November 1,\n\n2011, the FCC released an additional 193 pages (65 documents), bringing the total to 555 pages\n\nof material released. Redactions were made to these materials pursuant to Exemptions 4, 5, 6,\n\nand 7(C). The present controversy relates to this November 2011 release of 193 pages.\n\n        COMPTEL filed a second administrative application for review of the FCC’s redactions\n\nto these documents on November 11, 2011. Pl.’s SMF ¶ 23. On June 19, 2012, the FCC issued\n\na Memorandum Opinion and Order denying in part and granting in part the application for\n\nreview. Specifically, it ordered EB to provide the names of certain SBC and FCC staff that had\n\nbeen publicly identified and thus had been redacted in error under Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n\n        The instant cross-motions for summary judgment were filed in July 2012. The FCC did\n\nnot release the additional information required by the June 2012 Order until the cross-motions\n\nwere pending and ripe for review. Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info., ECF No. 58. COMPTEL\n\nreplied to that supplemental release, asserting that the FCC had (strangely) included new\n\nredactions of information previously released and that it did not appear to have released\n\ninformation the Order required to be provided. Pl.’s Reply to Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info.,\n\nECF No. 59 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply to Release].                The FCC has not filed a supplemental\n\ndeclaration or revised Vaughn index to account for the latest release of information.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  COMPTEL states that the documents include “the publicly available plea agreements and FCC decision described\nin . . .

LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       A.      FOIA Generally\n\n       The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, requires federal agencies to make\n\ncertain records publicly available. FOIA requires that agencies, upon request, “make the records\n\npromptly available to any person.” Id. § 552(a)(3)(A). The Agency shall determine within\n\ntwenty business days of receipt whether to comply with a request and shall immediately notify\n\nthe requester of its determination and reasons therefore. Id. § 552(a)(6)(A). However, failure to\n\nmeet the time limit is not a basis for denying an agency summary judgment. See Tijerina v.\n\nWalters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (D.C.

Additionally, to the extent an\n\nexemption is invoked, any “reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided” after\n\ndeletion of the exempt portions. Id. § 552(b).

Jurisdiction\n\n         This Court has jurisdiction to decide the pending cross-motions. The U.S. District Court\n\nfor the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to “enjoin the agency from withholding agency\n\nrecords and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a)(4)(B). District courts are to examine FOIA matters de novo. Id. 5\n\n         B.       Adequacy of FCC’s Search\n\n         COMPTEL states that it “has not challenged the reasonableness of the FCC’s search,”\n\nonly the “adequacy of its production,” and does not specifically allege bad faith by the FCC.\n\n5\n  FOIA requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before a requester may bring suit. Spannaus v. U.S. Dep’t. of\nJustice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491631\"><a href=\"/opinion/491631/edward-spannaus-v-us-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (D.C.

While this is a jurisprudential, rather than jurisdictional, requirement, it\n“precludes judicial review if the purposes of exhaustion and the particular administrative scheme support such a\nbar.” Hidalgo v.

Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the\ndefendant does not suggest, nor does it appear, that COMPTEL failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The FCC\ndid not comply with statutory response time limits and COMPTEL thus “constructively” exhausted administrative\nremedies with respect to its 2005 request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C). Additionally, though COMPTEL filed a\nsecond FOIA request in 2007, to the extent it needed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that request,\nit did so constructively when the FCC again did not meet statutory time limits.\n\n                                                          9\n\fPl.’s Reply to Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s MSJ 2, ECF No. 56 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply]. Nevertheless,\n\nCOMPTEL suggests the FCC may have withheld documents and seeks an order compelling the\n\nFCC to “disclose the total volume of documents responsive to COMPTEL’s FOIA request . . .\n\nincluding the other 2600 to 2700 pages identified as potentially responsive” in a 2005 email.\n\nPl.’s Mem P. & A. 37. Although COMPTEL disclaims an intent to challenge the adequacy of\n\nthe FCC’s search, the Court must consider the issue to decide the FCC’s motion for summary\n\njudgment. See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Summ. J. 1, 10, ECF No. 53 [hereinafter Def.’s Mem.\n\nP. & A.] (seeking judgment as a matter of law that FCC conducted a reasonable search).\n\n       “To prevail on summary judgment . . . the defending ‘agency must show beyond material\n\ndoubt . . . that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\n\ndocuments.’” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1114 (quoting Weisberg v.

See SafeCard Servs., 926 F.2d\n\nat 1200. However, summary judgment is improper where “agency affidavits . . . do not denote\n\nwhich files were searched, or by whom, do not reflect any systematic approach to document\n\nlocation, and do not provide information specific enough to enable [the requester] to challenge\n\nthe procedures utilized.” Weisberg v.

Cir. 1980).\n\n       The history of this case makes it difficult for the Court to address the adequacy of the\n\nFCC’s search.     First, the present cross-motions for summary judgment relate only to\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fCOMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request which requested all documents “referenced in the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster” submitted with the FCC’s earlier motion for\n\nsummary judgment, as well as “all correspondence with any third party contained in FCC Case\n\nfile no. EB-04-IH-0342.” See In the Matter of COMPTEL, 27 F.C.C.R. 7705. 6 Thus, assuming\n\nthat the search in response to the 2005 request was adequate and that Ms. Lancaster’s\n\nsupplemental declaration listed all responsive documents, the 2007 request should result in the\n\ndisclosure of at least as much information as the 2005 request, if not more given COMPTEL’s\n\nadditional request for “all correspondence with any third party.”\n\n        However, there remains a possible dispute of fact as to whether, “[i]n response to the\n\n2007 FOIA request, . . . Commission staff searched the Commission’s files and staff e-mails for\n\ndocuments responsive to the request.” Compare Def.’s SMF ¶ 11 (making this assertion) and\n\nLancaster Suppl. Decl., July 25, 2012 (same), with Pl.’s Stmt. Mat. Facts in Opp’n to Def.’s\n\nStmt. Mat. Facts 2, ECF No. 55-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s SMF in Opp’n] (disputing the assertion).\n\nCOMPTEL disputes that the Commission conducted a search, asserting that “all of the\n\ndocuments responsive to COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request were identified in the Declaration and\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Judy Lancaster filed with this Court on February 12, 2007 and\n\nApril 13, 2011.” Pl.’s SMF in Opp’n 2. 7 Whether this is a genuine dispute of fact need not be\n\nresolved here because it is not just the fact that a search occurred, but also the adequacy of the\n\n\n\n6\n COMPTEL characterizes the 2007 request as being only for documents “already identified in Ms. Lancaster’s\nSupplemental Declaration” Pl.’s SMF ¶ 15, though the request seems to have been somewhat broader.”\n7\n Despite COMPTEL’s opposition, the FCC asserts that the statement is not in genuine dispute. First, it argues that\nCOMPTEL has not identified any contradictory evidence to show that the FCC did not complete a search. The\nCourt notes however that, as with all other FOIA plaintiffs, there is an information asymmetry that inhibits\nCOMPTEL from offering evidence regarding whether the FCC actually conducted a search. Second, the FCC\nargues that Judy Lancaster’s prior declarations (which were given before the FCC even received the 2007 request)\nsupport its contention that it conducted a search in response to the 2007 request. This is not possible since those\ndeclarations were executed before the 2007 request. However, Ms. Lancaster’s most recent declaration does lend\nsome support to the FCC’s contention.\n\n                                                        11\n\fsearch, that is required for summary judgment. The Court finds the FCC’s declaration to be\n\ninsufficient to demonstrate the adequacy of its search as well.\n\n       The most recent Lancaster declaration describes the FCC’s search in two sentences,\n\nstating that the FCC “searched the Commission’s files and staff e-mails for documents\n\nresponsive to the request” and that staff “reviewed each document[,] . . . discarded non-\n\nresponsive documents, and marked each responsive document for redaction.” Lancaster Supp.\n\nDecl. ¶ 5. The FCC provides no additional information about the search method used, the files\n\nreviewed, or the identity of the parties conducting the search. In fact, Ms. Lancaster does not\n\nstate whether she was involved in or otherwise has personal knowledge of the search, saying\n\nonly that she has been an EB attorney since 1999. Moreover, the FCC’s most recent release of\n\ninformation casts doubt on the adequacy of its search. Specifically, COMPTEL points out that\n\npreviously redacted email headers have now been disclosed on all emails released by the FCC.\n\nPl.’s Reply to Release 10. Those headers reveal that all of the released emails came from the\n\nemail account of David Janas despite the fact that numerous FCC employees appear to have been\n\ninvolved in the SBC investigation. Id. Thus, unless David Janas was a party to every email\n\nchain involving the SBC investigation, searching for emails only from his account would not\n\nresult in an adequate search.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court cannot grant summary judgment for the FCC\n\nbecause it cannot find, based on the evidence before it, that the FCC has conducted an adequate\n\nsearch. However, because COMPTEL has not challenged the adequacy of the FCC’s search, the\n\nCourt also cannot grant summary judgment for COMPTEL on this point. Instead, the FCC will\n\nbe required to submit a revised declaration which more fully describes its search. While the\n\nCourt could conclude its analysis here, the Court now also addresses the FCC’s invocation of\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fFOIA exemptions. Assuming the FCC can demonstrate the adequacy of its search, its current\n\nVaughn index and declaration would be inadequate to demonstrate that the agency has properly\n\ninvoked FOIA exemptions to withhold redacted information.\n\n       C.      Adequacy of Vaughn Index and Invocation of Exemptions\n\n       The FCC’s Vaughn index and declaration are insufficient for several reasons.\n\n       First, as outlined below, they rely on conclusory assertions to justify withholding\n\ninformation under the FOIA exemptions.\n\n       Second, while the FCC states that “all reasonably segregable, non-exemption information\n\n. . . [was] provided to the Requester,” Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶ 5, this is insufficient to meet the\n\nFCC’s burden with respect to FOIA segregability requirements. The Vaughn index should\n\nindicate, with respect to each document, that any reasonably segregable information has been\n\nreleased. Krikorian v. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599116\"><a href=\"/opinion/599116/van-z-krikorian-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1993). As the FCC’s Vaughn\n\nindex stands now, the Court cannot even tell whether the entire contents of a given document\n\nhave been redacted or whether only portions have been withheld.\n\n       Third, the FCC has not amended its Vaughn index to account for information it released\n\nto COMPTEL after the motions for summary judgment were ripe. As a result, the Court cannot\n\ndetermine what information remains redacted.\n\n               1.      Exemption 4\n\n       The FCC invokes Exemption 4 to redact information from 17 documents. Specifically, it\n\nseeks to redact the names and/or phone numbers of SBC staff and contractors, which it\n\ncategorizes as “competitively sensitive” (Documents 13–15, 19, 26, 31, 33, 40–44, and 64);\n\n“competitively sensitive information regarding settlement negotiations” (Documents 14–15, 20,\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f26); “confidential settlement information”; and SBC’s “competitively sensitive financial\n\ninformation” (Documents 27, 31, 34, 42–44).\n\n         FOIA Exemption 4 protects from disclosure “trade secrets and commercial or financial\n\ninformation obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).\n\nBecause the FCC has not asserted that any redacted information contains trade secrets, the Court\n\nonly addresses the test for “commercial or financial” information. Such information is exempt\n\nonly if it is (1) commercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or\n\nconfidential. Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v.

Names and Contact Information of SBC/AT&T Employees and\n                                   Contractors\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 4 to redact the names and/or phone numbers of SBC staff\n\nand contractors in Documents 13–15, 19, 26, 31, 33, 40–44, and 64. 8 COMPTEL argues that in\n\nsome cases the FCC has improperly invoked Exemption 4. 9 Though it does not explain exactly\n\nwhy the redactions fail, it seems to imply that names do not meet the definition of “commercial\n\nor financial information.” See Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 18, 30–31; Pl.’s Reply 10.                       Mysteriously,\n\nCOMPTEL also states that it “has no objection to the redaction of the AT&T employee’s contact\n\ninformation,” 10 Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. 31, or to the redaction of the names of SBC contractors. Pl.’s\n\nReply 9. As the Court interprets these possibly conflicting statements, COMPTEL objects only\n\n8\n  According to its Vaughn index, the FCC also protects the names of SBC staff and contractors pursuant to\nExemption 5 (Document 13), Exemption 6 (Document 31, 33, 40–44, and 64) and Exemption 7(C) (Documents 13–\n15, 33–34, 40–44, 64). Because of a lack of detail in the Vaughn index, the Court presumes, but cannot be sure that\nthe same names are redacted under all of the exemptions. The FCC should clarify this in its amended filing.\n9\n  COMPTEL states that the FCC has improperly deleted “the names of authors, addresses, [and] ‘contacts’ or\nsenders of faxes to the Commission.” Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 18 (citing Documents 14–15, 19, 41–42, 64, and 65).\n10\n  COMPTEL makes this statement in the context of redactions made to Document 13 though it presumably would\nnot object to the redaction of AT&T or SBC employee contact information in other documents either.\n\n                                                        15\n\fto the redaction of the names of SBC staff and not to the redaction of their contact information or\n\nto the redaction of the names or contact information of SBC contractors.\n\n        The FCC has not met its burden to show that names and contact information should be\n\nexempt as confidential commercial or financial information. Names clearly are not financial\n\ninformation and thus the FCC must consider them to be commercial in nature. While the Court\n\nassumes corporations can have a commercial interest in the names of certain staff, it is not a\n\ncertainty that a corporation would have a commercial interest in the names of every one of its\n\nemployees. Thus, the FCC must state why this information is commercial in nature.\n\n        Further, the FCC has not alleged that the information was “obtained from a person.” For\n\nexample, the name of an SBC staffer in an email sent from FCC staff to SBC staff would not\n\nlikely constitute information “obtained from a person.”\n\n        In any case, the FCC likewise has not shown that the information is confidential.\n\nAlthough the FCC asserts that SBC submitted information to FCC voluntarily, there is some\n\nindication to the contrary. 11 Because of the distinction between the tests for voluntarily versus\n\ninvoluntarily submitted information, the FCC must disclose to the Court whether any\n\ninformation redacted was involuntarily submitted. If voluntarily provided, the FCC must then\n\nshow that the information is “of a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by\n\nthe person from whom it was obtained.” If involuntarily provided, the FCC must show that\n\ndisclosure would impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future\n\nor cause substantial competitive harm to AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The FCC acknowledges that some information may have been submitted in the context of a law enforcement\ninvestigation. It notes that its Letter of Inquiry “required SBC to submit internal documents to the Commission in\nconnection with the FCC’s investigation.” See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. 21 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                       16\n\f                       b.      Other Commercial and Financial Information\n\n       The FCC also invokes Exemption 4 to redact “competitively sensitive information\n\nregarding settlement negotiations” (Documents 14–15, 20, 26), “confidential settlement\n\ninformation,” and SBC’s “competitively sensitive financial information” (Documents 27, 31, 34,\n\n42–44).\n\n       COMPTEL launches various challenges to these redactions. First, it argues that material\n\nprovided and exchanged in settlement negotiation emails between FCC staff and between the\n\nFCC and SBC cannot be withheld under Exemption 4. COMPTEL seems to interpret the FCC’s\n\njustifications for these redactions as proceeding solely from the fact that the information was\n\nexchanged in settlement negotiations. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 20. Second, it alleges that information\n\nredacted from staff notes, draft letters of inquiry, and emails initiated by the FCC cannot be\n\nprotected under Exemption 4 because the information was not “obtained from a person.” Pl.’s\n\nMem P. & A. 19–20; Pl.’s Reply 10 (citing Documents 27, 31, 34, 42–44). Third, COMPTEL\n\nseems to simply argue that the FCC has not met its burden to show that the information meets the\n\nrequirements of Exemption 4.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, to the extent the FCC redacted information under Exemption 4\n\nsolely because it relates to settlement, the Court would reject such a justification. The FCC’s\n\nrationale for its redactions is not entirely clear: its Vaughn index appears to attempt to fit the\n\nredacted information into the traditional requirements of Exemption 4 by labeling it\n\n“competitively sensitive,” yet its declaration often justifies redactions purely on the basis of its\n\nrelation to settlement negotiations. Compare Vaughn Index 12, ECF No. 53-2 (noting redaction\n\nof “[c]ompetitively sensitive financial information”), with Lancaster Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 21–22\n\n(describing redacted documents as “prepared for settlement negotiations” and “discussing FCC\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fand SBC settlement offers”). Moreover, the FCC states that “information exchanged within the\n\ncontext of settlement negotiations may be properly withheld under Exemption (b)(4)” and that\n\n“documents related to settlement discussions [are] not normally revealed to the public.” Def.’s\n\nMem. P. & A. 12. However, the case cited for the proposition that settlement discussion\n\ninformation may be redacted appears to involve commercial or financial information that would\n\nseparately qualify for Exemption 4 protection.

Information\n\nregarding settlement negotiations may only qualify for Exemption 4 protection if it is (1)\n\ncommercial or financial information; (2) obtained from a person; and (3) confidential.\n\n       The Court disagrees with COMPTEL that information redacted from staff notes, draft\n\nletters of inquiry, and emails cannot be protected under Exemption 4 because it was not\n\n“obtained from a person.” As stated above, information originally obtained from an outside\n\nsource, but later included in agency documents, may be considered “obtained from a person.”\n\nHowever, the FCC must state in its declarations or Vaughn index that the information was\n\noriginally obtained from SBC or another person.\n\n       More broadly, the Court agrees with COMPTEL that the FCC has failed to meet its\n\nburden to show that redacted information meets the requirements of Exemption 4. For example,\n\nMs. Lancaster’s declaration notes that information was redacted because it would “reveal\n\nprotected information,” a description that is clearly inadequate. See, e.g., Lancaster Suppl. Decl.\n\n¶¶ 18–19, 21–24. While the Vaughn Index is somewhat more detailed, it too fails to provide\n\nsufficient information.   By way of example, the index states that “competitively sensitive\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\finformation regarding settlement negotiations” was redacted from an email chain between FCC\n\nand SBC staff. Vaughn Index 7 (describing redactions from Document 14). These sorts of\n\nconclusory assertions, without any additional description of the contents of the redacted\n\ninformation or reasons for non-disclosure, are insufficient to show that Exemption 4 was\n\nappropriately invoked. Not only do such assertions not demonstrate that the information was\n\n“commercial or financial,” but in many cases the FCC has failed to even allege that the\n\ninformation was confidential or “obtained from a person” (something that is particularly\n\nimportant in documents drafted by FCC). These problems persist throughout the Vaughn Index.\n\n       Again, it may be that the FCC has properly redacted information under Exemption 4.\n\nHowever, the Court lacks sufficient information to make this determination.\n\n               2.     Exemption 5\n\n       The FCC invokes Exemption 5 to redact information from all documents except\n\nDocument 19. Vaughn Index. Exemption 5 shields from disclosure “inter-agency or intra-\n\nagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an\n\nagency in litigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).

It reiterates that the agency bears the burden to establish confidentiality. Id.\n\n(citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 863).\n\n       The FCC has done nothing to show that material for which the attorney–client privilege\n\nwas invoked involved confidential communications or that it related to a legal matter for which\n\nthe client sought legal advice. Again, as the D.C. Circuit noted in Coastal States, conclusory\n\nassertions of privilege will not suffice to carry the Government’s burden of proof in defending\n\nFOIA cases. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 861. The Circuit noted in that case,\n\n       The parties have referred to these materials as the Government’s “Vaughn Index,”\n       but we wish to make clear that this index is not what we had in mind in our\n       decision in Vaughn . . . . A typical line from the index supplied in this case\n       identifies who wrote the memorandum, to whom it was addressed, its date, [] a\n       brief description of the memorandum [, and a] claim[ that the] document was\n       “PD” (predecisional), “ATWP” (attorney work-product) . . . . Such an index is\n       patently inadequate.\n\n       Id.\n\n       The index submitted by the FCC is quite similar to that rejected by the D.C. Circuit in\n\nCoastal States in that it merely identifies who wrote the memorandum, includes a brief\n\ndescription, and claims that it represents attorney–client material.\n\n       In addition to not sufficiently supporting its assertions of confidentiality, the information\n\nsubmitted by FCC sometimes suggests an absence of confidentiality. For example, the FCC\n\nseeks to protect “attorney–client discussions” in an email chain between FCC staff and SBC\n\nofficials. However, information shared with outside entities would no longer be confidential.\n\nSee Mead Data Ctr., 566 F.2d at 255 (noting that a document setting forth the background and\n\nnegotiations with a publishing company may not reflect confidential communications given that\n\nmuch of the information would also be known to the publishing company itself).

Attorney Work-Product Privilege\n\n        The FCC has also invoked the attorney work-product privilege to redact information from\n\nor fully withhold Documents 4–7, 10, 13–14, 17–18, 20–21, 24, 26–27, 28–29, 31, 34, 44, 47–\n\n49, 50, and 51–64.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (D.D.C. 1984).\n\n        COMPTEL argues that the FCC has not met its burden to show that redacted materials\n\nwere attorney work product. 14 Many of the documents for which the privilege is invoked appear\n\nto have been prepared by an attorney during the course of the investigation into SBC, or\n\nimmediately thereafter as the FCC contemplated additional enforcement actions.\n\n\n\n\n14\n  As an example, COMPTEL cites Document 30 as an example of an unreasonable invocation of the work-product\nprivilege because the FCC does not list the parties to the email. However, the Vaughn index does not appear to\nassert attorney work-product privilege for this document, unless the reference to “legal analysis” is intended as a\nreference to the work-product privilege.\n\n                                                        23\n\f       The Court notes that the requirements of the work-product doctrine are more easily met\n\nthan those for the attorney–client privilege. The FCC need only demonstrate that the materials\n\nwere prepared in anticipation of litigation and need not segregate deliberative from factual\n\nmaterial. However, the FCC must identify the nexus between the documents and any potential\n\nlitigation or settlement thereof. Again, the FCC relies on fairly conclusory assertions of the\n\nprivilege here.    See, e.g., Vaughn Index (describing redactions from Document 34 as\n\n“[h]andwritten notes of Dave Janas, FCC staff attorney, containing deliberative process attorney\n\nwork product analysis of SBC invoices”); id. (describing redactions from Document 13 as\n\n“[h]andwritten attorney work product note of Dave Janas, FCC staff attorney, containing SBC\n\nstaff contact information and statement memorializing a request from the person”); id.\n\n(describing redactions from Document 14 as “an attorney work product analysis by Dave Janas,\n\nFCC staff attorney, of SBC submissions . . . .”). While the Court assumes that the FCC can meet\n\nits burden given the nature of the investigation and settlement discussions at issue, the FCC must\n\nprovide somewhat more detail in order for the Court to make this determination.\n\n                      d.      Deliberative Process Privilege\n\n       The deliberative process privilege encompasses “recommendations and deliberations\n\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.”\n\nKlamath, 532 U.S. at 8–9 (quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109241\"><a href=\"/opinion/109241/nlrb-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (1975)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). The general purpose of the privilege is to “prevent injury to\n\nthe quality of agency decisions.” Sears, Roebuck, 421 U.S. at 151.\n\n       The privilege protects agency documents that are both “predecisional and deliberative.”\n\nJudicial Watch v. FDA, 449 F.3d at 151. A document is predecisional if “‘it was generated\n\nbefore the adoption of an agency policy.’” Judicial Watch v. FDA, 449 F.3d at 151 (quoting\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 866).

See, e.g., Judicial Watch v. FDA,\n\n449 F.3d at 152 (noting that documents dated after a drug’s approval could still be predecisional\n\nwith respect to other policies, including uses of the drug the agency had not approved).\n\n       A document is “deliberative” if “‘it reflects the give-and-take of the consultative\n\nprocess.’” Id. (quoting Coastal States Gas, 617 F.2d at 866). D.C.

Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501788\"><a href=\"/opinion/501788/sidney-m-wolfe-v-department-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).               Non-\n\ndeliberative, factual portions of a document must segregated and disclosed. Petroleum Info.\n\nCorp., 976 F.2d at 1434.\n\n       COMPTEL opposes the FCC’s use of the deliberative process privilege for four reasons.\n\nFirst, it believes the FCC has withheld certain materials pursuant to Exemption 5 solely because\n\nthey relate to settlement discussions and argues that there is “no federal settlement privilege.”\n\nThe Court is not certain that the FCC invokes a federal settlement privilege. Instead, it seems to\n\nargue that the documents include predecisional, deliberative materials shielded under Exemption\n\n5. See Def.’s Opp’n 14–15. Specifically, the FCC only asserts that documents “related to the\n\nFCC’s evaluation of the merits of settling with SBC” would be exempt from disclosure. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f(emphasis added). However, the FCC’s Vaughn index is not sufficiently detailed for the Court to\n\nensure that the documents meet both the predecisional and deliberativeness requirements, thus\n\nthe FCC will need to supplement its filings to address these requirements.\n\n       Second, with respect to documents post-dating the consent decree for which the FCC has\n\ninvoked the deliberative process privilege, COMPTEL argues that the documents cannot be\n\nconsidered “predecisional.”    See Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 24. It also argues that any documents\n\nreflecting the FCC’s decision not to pursue other causes of action or reflecting resolution of an\n\nissue must be produced because they are not predecisional. Id. at 26–27. The Court disagrees.\n\nA document may post-date one decision but still be predecisional with respect to another\n\ndecision. However, again, the FCC has the burden to show the documents’ predecisional nature.\n\n       Third, COMPTEL suggests that FCC may not have segregated non-deliberative, factual\n\nmaterials. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 34. In support, COMPTEL points to documents 47 through 49\n\nwhich, it states, were redacted in their entirety.     However, the FCC invoked not only the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, but the attorney work-product privilege to protect material in these\n\ndocuments.     “If a document is fully protected as work product, then segregability is not\n\nrequired” because that privilege does not distinguish between factual and deliberative materials.\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186559\"><a href=\"/opinion/186559/jud-watch-inc-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Nevertheless, the\n\nagency must show that the document itself is fully protected as work product and then must state\n\nthat it considered whether non-protected material could be segregated. It has not done so.\n\n       Finally, COMPTEL seems to argue generally that the FCC has not met its burden to show\n\nthat certain documents are deliberative. As the Court has already stated, it agrees that the FCC\n\nhas not provided sufficient detail with which to evaluate its claims of deliberative privilege. For\n\nexample, with respect to Document 20, the FCC notes that it has redacted “[a]ttorney–client,\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fdeliberative process e-mail containing attorney work product analysis of SBC investigation\n\nevidence, recommendations regarding future actions and a request for approval of settlement\n\nprovision.” Vaughn Index 10. Not only does this label join three distinct privileges without\n\nseparately providing support for each, but it gives too little detail regarding the agency’s\n\njustification for invoking the deliberative privilege. Similarly, the FCC describes the redactions\n\nin Document 46 as “a deliberative process comment by FCC staff regarding a TR Daily story\n\nabout Sprint and the E-Rate program.” Finally, in at least one case, the redaction of a 3-page\n\nemail chain in Document 34, the FCC does not even identify which privilege has been invoked\n\nto protect redacted information.\n\n        In short, the FCC has not met its burden to show the applicability of Exemption 5. Bare\n\nand conclusory assertions of the privilege are not sufficient.\n\n                 3.       Exemption 6\n\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 6 to redact the names and work contact information of\n\nFCC, DOJ, USAC, and SBC staff. 15\n\n        Since filing for summary judgment, the FCC has allegedly released the names of some\n\nSBC/AT&T staff and one FCC staff-level employee to conform with the FCC’s Memorandum\n\nOpinion and Order in In the Matter of Comptel. Def.’s Notice Suppl. Release Info. (citing\n\nF.C.C. 12-64, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2354823</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (June 19, 2012)). These appear to have originally been\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6 and 7(C). The FCC’s Memorandum and Order held that the\n\nredactions were erroneous because these employees had already been publicly connected with\n\nthe investigation. COMPTEL now disputes whether the FCC has released the information\n\n15\n  Specifically it redacts the names, office addresses and/or room numbers, telephone and fax numbers, email\naddresses, website information, and employer name of FCC and/or DOJ staff (Documents 1–12, 14–20, 22–26, 28–\n30, 32–50, 64–65); the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and office room numbers of USAC staff\n(Documents 25, 30, 32–34, 45); and the names, email addresses, job titles and descriptions, office phone numbers,\nand work departments of SBC staff (Documents 31, 33–34, 40–44, 64).\n\n                                                       27\n\frequired by the FCC Memorandum and Order. See Pl.’s Reply to Release. The FCC has not\n\nprovided an amended Vaughn index by which the Court can evaluate these claims. The FCC\n\nshould revise its Vaughn index to provide the Court with this information.\n\n       Because the Vaughn index and declaration are insufficient in other ways with respect to\n\nExemption 6, the Court outlines those deficiencies below so that the FCC may supplement its\n\nfilings and the parties may re-file for summary judgment.\n\n       Exemption 6 protects from disclosure “personnel and medical files and similar files the\n\ndisclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). “Similar files” are interpreted broadly and are intended to cover “‘detailed\n\nGovernment records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.’”\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State v.

P. & A. 14. With respect to government employees, it argues that their names are not\n\npersonal information in which they have a protected privacy interest, noting that their names and\n\nduty stations are available to the public and that names, phone numbers, and email addresses of\n\nFCC employees are available on the FCC’s website. Id. at 14–15.\n\n       Because courts have broadly defined what constitutes a “similar” file under Exemption 4\n\nto include information that applies to a particular individual, see supra, the documents referenced\n\nare likely to constitute “similar files.”   However, any privacy interests at stake will vary\n\ndepending on the individuals identified. With respect to SBC employees, for example, the Court\n\nassumes that there is likely more than a de minimis privacy interest in the employees’ names and\n\ncontact information.    This is particularly the case where the individuals may have been\n\nresponding to allegations of potential wrongdoing by their employer, SBC.\n\n       However, it is less likely that employees of USAC, FCC, and DOJ would have\n\nsubstantial privacy interests. A number of courts have considered the applicability of Exemption\n\n6 to government employees though their treatment does not appear to be particularly uniform.\n\nSee, e.g., Aguirre v.

Furthermore, the names of FCC staff are available through a search\n\nfunction on the FCC’s website that allows one to generate a list of all of the individuals who\n\nwork in EB along with their work telephone numbers and email addresses. The public nature of\n\nthis information weakens the FCC’s claim.            Nevertheless, the Court acknowledges that\n\ngovernment and USAC employees might have a more than de minimis privacy interest in\n\ninformation that not only identifies them, but links them to work on a particular investigation.\n\n       However, whatever hypothetical privacy interests the Court may imagine, the FCC has\n\nnot met its burden to show that Exemption 6 was appropriately invoked. The FCC suggests that\n\nnames, office addresses, job titles, work phone numbers, etc. are “personal and private\n\nidentifying information” in which “individuals have an expectation of privacy.” Def.’s Mem. P.\n\n& A. 18–20. However, the FCC’s Vaughn index does nothing more than restate the law and its\n\ndeclaration does not even address the redactions made pursuant to either Exemption 6 or\n\nExemption 7(C).     See, e.g., Vaughn Index 3 (describing redactions from Document 5 as\n\n“personal and private Identifying information (names, name of employer) of FCC and DOJ\n\nGov’t staff”). While courts often uphold the redaction of personal identifying information under\n\nExemption 6, the agency must at least provide the Court with some basis for such an interest.\n\nThis is particularly the case with respect to USAC, FCC, and DOJ staff since these individuals\n\nwere engaged in performance of their official duties, not targets of any investigation, and may be\n\nat less risk for embarrassment, harassment, or unwanted contacts, etc. While the Court can\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fimagine situations in which a privacy interest might exist because of these individuals’ roles in\n\nthe FCC investigation, the FCC has not provided any such justification.\n\n        On the other hand, COMPTEL has not asserted any public interest in disclosure of these\n\nnames. If the FCC shows a privacy interest in non-disclosure, COMPTEL cannot survive\n\nsummary judgment without identifying a public interest in disclosure. “[S]omething, even a\n\nmodest privacy interest, outweighs nothing every time.” Horner, 879 F.2d at 879.\n\n        Finally, because the FCC has allegedly released the names of certain individuals that it\n\nerroneously withheld, the Court has no way of knowing which names the agency plans to redact\n\nat this time. The agency should submit a revised Vaughn index to reflect the most recent release\n\nof information along with any asserted privacy interests.\n\n                 4.      Exemption 7(C)\n\n        The FCC invokes Exemption 7(C) to protect names and contact information of SBC,\n\nUSAC, and FCC staff and FCC interns and other individuals in “law enforcement documents.” 16\n\n        Exemption 7(C) protects from disclosure “records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records\n\nor information . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(7)(C).\n\n        Records compiled for law enforcement purposes may relate to either criminal or civil\n\nmatters.

See Martin v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797941\"><a href=\"/opinion/797941/harold-martin-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456–57 (D.C.

Thus, “privacy interests are particularly difficult to overcome\n\nwhen law enforcement information about third parties is implicated.” Id. at 457.\n\n        COMPTEL does not generally dispute that the documents for which Exemption 7(C) is\n\ninvoked were compiled for law enforcement purposes. However, it argues that the names of\n\nFCC and DOJ staff who worked on the SBC investigation and the names of AT&T counsel who\n\nauthored or received copies of correspondence related to the investigation were not compiled for\n\nlaw enforcement purposes. Pl.’s Mem. P. & A. 17.; Pl.’s Reply 11. 17\n\n        There are two problems with this argument. First, the FCC does not appear to invoke\n\nExemption 7(C) to protect the names of any DOJ staff. In fact, Exemption 7(C) is invoked in\n\nonly one document to justify redaction of the names of FCC staff and interns. Additionally, the\n\nCourt cannot confirm whether FCC redacted the names of AT&T counsel under Exemption 7(C).\n\n17\n  The Court cannot confirm that the names of AT&T counsel were redacted by the FCC. COMPTEL does not point\nthe Court to a particular document number or assertion in the FCC Declaration or Vaughn index.\n\n                                                   32\n\f       Second, COMPTEL misconstrues the inquiry into whether names may be redacted under\n\nExemption 7(C). While the names at issue may not have been compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes, if they are contained in records compiled for law enforcement purposes they may be\n\nredacted.

See Pl.’s SMF ¶ 2 (describing the request for documents related to\n\npossible violations by SBC of the Commission’s rules). Courts have previously upheld treatment\n\nof FCC investigatory files as law enforcement records. See, e.g., Kay v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456255\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456255/kay-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Here, the documents all appear include a connection between a particular entity\n\nor incident and a possible violation of federal law. Thus, all of the documents for which\n\nExemption 7(C) protection was sought appear to have been compiled for law enforcement.\n\n       Nevertheless, COMPTEL argues, and the Court agrees, that the FCC has not shown that\n\ndisclosure of the redacted information could reasonably be expected to result in an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy for all individuals involved. While the FCC is correct that courts often\n\nuphold the redaction of the names of individuals identified in law enforcement records, including\n\nthe names of government employees, the FCC must do more than simply assert that these\n\nindividuals “have a clear expectation of privacy,” Def.’s Mem. P. & A. 22. For example, courts\n\nhave upheld the redaction of the names of government employees performing their official duties\n\nwhen the disclosure of their names might results in harassment, intimidation, or attempts to\n\nunduly influence, or obtain information about, the employees’ work. In Concepcion v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157880/concepcion-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2009), the court upheld redaction of the names of FBI Special Agents\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fbecause, if their “identities were disclosed, they may be subjected to ‘unnecessary, unofficial\n\nquestioning regarding this and/or other investigations, whether or not they are currently\n\nemployed by the FBI.’ In addition, ‘publicity associated with the release of [a Special Agent’s]\n\nidentity in connection with a particular law enforcement investigation could rekindle animosity\n\ntoward that [Special Agent]’ on the part of persons targeted or otherwise affected by law\n\nenforcement action involving the agent.” Concepcion, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 38 (quoting agency’s\n\ndeclaration). The court also upheld the redaction of the names of support personnel because they\n\n“‘were, and possibly are, in positions to access information regarding official law enforcement\n\ninvestigations,’ [and] ‘could become targets of harassing inquiries for unauthorized access to\n\ninvestigations if their identities were released.’” Id. (quoting agency’s declaration). However,\n\nthe court relied on the sworn declarations provided by the agency identifying these privacy\n\nconcerns.   Here, the FCC merely restates the legal standard for Exemption 7(C).           This is\n\ninsufficient to support summary judgment. See United Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2331249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2331249/united-america-financial-inc-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Neither of the . . . declarations . . . establish that the investigators and\n\ninspectors have a privacy interest . . . . [A]n agency must at least explain the ground for\n\nconcluding that there is some factual basis for concerns about harassment, intimidation, or\n\nphysical harm.” (internal quotation marks omitted))).\n\n       On the other hand, COMPTEL has made no showing of any public interest in disclosure.\n\nThus, as with the Exemption 6 analysis, COMPTEL will fail on summary judgment if the FCC\n\ncan show any privacy interest at all.\n\n       Finally, the FCC’s June 2012 Memorandum and Order required the release of names of\n\ncertain SBC/AT&T and FCC employees whose names were erroneously redacted under\n\nExemption 7(C). The FCC has not revised its Vaughn index or declaration to account for this\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fdisclosure. As a result, the Court cannot know in which documents the FCC invokes Exemption\n\n7(C).\n\n        In summary, the FCC must amend its Vaughn index to account for the deficiencies\n\nidentified above. While it is possible that the FCC can show that it appropriately redacted\n\ninformation pursuant to Exemption 7(C), as well as Exemptions 4, 5, and 6, the FCC cannot rely\n\non bare and conclusory assertions to demonstrate this. Accordingly, the FCC should submit a\n\nrevised Vaughn index and declaration.\n\n        D.     Declaratory Judgment Analysis\n\n        COMPTEL seeks a declaratory judgment that the FCC has violated the FOIA and that its\n\n“pattern and practice” of delays in disclosing material to COMPTEL is unlawful and\n\nunreasonable. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 1, 6. It also seeks a finding that the FCC’s failure to disclose\n\nthe volume of material withheld violates FOIA. Pl.’s Mem P. & A. 6.\n\n        While FOIA does not specifically provide for declaratory relief, the Act “imposes no\n\nlimits on courts’ equitable powers in enforcing its terms.” Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500338\"><a href=\"/opinion/500338/payne-enterprises-inc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citing Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108960\"><a href=\"/opinion/108960/renegotiation-bd-v-bannercraft-clothing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19-20 (1974).    However, “a declaration that an agency’s initial refusal to disclose\n\nrequested information was unlawful, after the agency made that information available, would\n\nconstitute an advisory opinion in contravention of Article III of the Constitution.”       Payne\n\nEnters., 837 F.2d at 491 (citing Better Gov’t Ass’n v. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462581\"><a href=\"/opinion/462581/better-government-association-v-department-of-state-national-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1986)). A party whose FOIA request has been satisfied, however, may seek declaratory relief if\n\nan “agency policy or practice will impair the party’s lawful access to information in the future.”\n\nId. (citing Better Gov’t Ass’n, 780 F.2d at 90–92). The D.C. Circuit in Payne found that the\n\ndistrict court had abused its discretion in refusing to grant declaratory relief. In that case,\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fofficers at Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) bases had refused to fulfill a FOIA request\n\neven after the Secretary of the Air Force admonished AFLC officials for their failure to act.\n\nPayne Enters., 837 F.2d at 494.\n\n       Here, the Court denies without prejudice the parties’ motions for summary and the parties\n\nmay refile their motions to address the issues identified in this opinion. As a result, it is possible\n\nthat COMPTEL’s FOIA request may be satisfied through summary judgment. It would be\n\ninappropriate for the Court to issue declaratory relief that the FCC has violated the FOIA when\n\nthe Court lacks sufficient information to make this determination.\n\n       Furthermore, the Court is doubtful that it could find that the FCC’s failure to disclose the\n\nvolume of material withheld is a violation of the FOIA. COMPTEL’s request for such a finding\n\nis based on the fact that the FCC, in a single email in 2005, suggested that there might be 3200\n\npages of “potentially responsive” documents. However, as the Court understands the parties’\n\nmotions for summary judgment, they are based on COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request. According\n\nto COMPTEL itself, that request sought the information identified as responsive in the FCC’s\n\ndeclarations with this Court (approximately 500–550 pages of material). Thus, by COMPTEL’s\n\nreasoning, there is no reason for the FCC to account for 2600 pages of “missing” material,\n\nbecause COMPTEL has sought only about 500–550 pages. Even if more material would be\n\nresponsive to the 2007 request, the Court cannot base a finding that the FCC has wrongfully\n\nwithheld 2600 pages of material on a single 2005 email. The FCC’s three sworn declarations\n\nsince that time have never cited more than approximately 550 pages of responsive material.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies without prejudice the parties’ motions for\n\nsummary judgment. The Court finds that the FCC has not demonstrated that it conducted an\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fadequate search in response to COMPTEL’s 2007 FOIA request. Even if the search had been\n\nshown to be adequate, the FCC has not met its burden to demonstrate, with respect to each\n\ndocument withheld or redacted, that it properly invoked any applicable exemptions and\n\nsegregated information to which an exemption did not apply. As a result, the Court denies\n\nwithout prejudice the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. The FCC shall submit a\n\nrevised Vaughn index and declaration no later than 30 days from today. As appropriate, the\n\nparties will have twenty days from the date of submission of the Vaughn index and declaration to\n\nsubmit new motions for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n       Signed by Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, on December 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f</pre>",
