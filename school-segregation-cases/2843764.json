Defendants National Property Holdings,\nL.P., Michael Plank, and Russell Plank (collectively, the “Plank Parties”)\ncounterclaimed, alleging breach of contract with regard to a settlement agreement\n\fand a release. The jury rendered findings favorable to Westergren and adverse to\nthe Plank Parties. The trial court rendered judgment that the parties take nothing\non their respective claims. On appeal, Westergren asserts that the trial court erred\nin rendering judgment he take nothing, in denying him leave to amend his petition\nduring trial, and in awarding court costs to the Plank Parties. On cross-appeal, the\nPlank Parties argue that the trial court erred in rendering judgment they take\nnothing. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for limited proceedings.\n\n              I.      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Appellant Gordon Westergren, a lifelong resident of LaPorte, Texas, wanted\nto purchase and develop certain real property in LaPorte, specifically, 190 acres on\nthe east side of Powell Road. These 190 acres are situated along a rail line\nbetween two shipping terminals.      Westergren entered into a purchase option\ncontract with the owners of the 190 acres. The owners later entered into two\nadditional purchase option contracts on the same 190 acres.          In July 2004,\nWestergren filed suit (“the 190-acres litigation”) against the owners and the two\nother parties who claimed an option to purchase the 190 acres, asserting that he\npossessed the superior right to purchase. Westergren also filed a lis pendens on the\nproperty, which effectively prevented the sale and development of the 190 acres.\n\n      While the 190-acres litigation was pending, Westergren met the Planks.\nSpecifically, Walter Johnson, then CEO of Amegy Bank, had participated in\nseveral “handshake” transactions with Westergren in which Johnson served as the\nfinancial partner while Westergren “found and sourced” property deals in the\nLaPorte area. Although Johnson was not interested in purchasing and developing\nthe 190 acres, Johnson introduced Westergren to two brothers, Michael Plank and\nRussell Plank, who were clients of the bank. Michael Plank is the President of the\ncorporate general partner of National Property Holdings, L.P. (“NPH”), a Texas\n\n                                         2\n\flimited partnership involved in real estate development. Russell Plank performs\nconsulting services for various companies, including NPH. Several developers,\nincluding NPH, were interested in purchasing and developing the 190 acres.\n\n       In January 2005, after Westergren met the Planks, Russell Plank contacted\nRobert Langston, the attorney representing Westergren in the 190-acres litigation.\nRussell Plank called Langston about paying Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\nLangston asked Russell Plank why he would do that for Westergren; Russell Plank\nresponded “[b]ecause we’re going to be partners.” Langston then received a $5000\ncheck from NPH1 and a $5000 check “personally” from Russell Plank.2\n\n       Although the Plank Parties were not parties to the 190-acres litigation,\nRussell Plank, sent by Michael Plank on behalf of NPH, attended a mediation\ninvolving the litigation parties in August 2005. Westergren and Langston attended\nthe mediation. At this mediation, NPH agreed to pay out cash settlements to all the\nlitigants, except Westergren, for their claims on the 190 acres. At the mediation,\naccording to Westergren and Langston, Russell Plank promised that, in exchange\nfor Westergren’s release of his lis pendens and the settlement of the 190-acres\nlitigation, Westergren would become a partner of the Plank Parties and would\nreceive $1 million cash and an interest in profits (the exact percentage to be\nnegotiated) from the purchase and development of the 190 acres. Westergren\ntestified that at the mediation Russell Plank said, “Don’t worry about it, Gordon.\nLet’s get these guys out of the way, and we’ll get it handled.”\n\n       Langston repeatedly requested of both Russell Plank and Westergren that the\nparties reduce their partnership deal to writing. In October 2005, Russell Plank\n\n       1\n         This check was co-signed by Russell Plank, and the check’s reference was to “LaPorte\nProperty.”\n       2\n           This check’s memo was for “Legal Fees—GW.”\n\n                                             3\n\fpresented Westergren with a profits interest agreement drafted by appellees’\nattorneys. This draft agreement stated that Westergren was to provide consulting\nservices in exchange for a 5% profit interest in funds distributed by NPH. Russell\nPlank then crossed out the 5% term and hand-wrote 10%, then 20%.                         This\nagreement was not signed.\n\n         In January 2006, NPH and the parties to the 190-acres litigation entered into\na Mediation Settlement Agreement (“MSA”). NPH was a signatory party to the\nMSA. Neither Michael Plank nor Russell Plank individually was a signatory to the\nMSA. In the MSA, NPH agreed to purchase the 190 acres in dispute; Westergren\nand the other parties to the litigation agreed to release any lis pendens, and to\nrelease and dismiss all claims regarding the 190 acres.\n\n         According to Westergren, at the time that he agreed to sign the MSA, he did\nso in reliance upon the oral partnership deal with NPH, Michael Plank, and Russell\nPlank:\n\n         [The Plank Parties] were going to pay me a cool million bucks for\n         signing off, letting them have control of the property, and give me a 5\n         percent interest in the 190 acres. That’s what caused me to give them\n         control of the property.\nWestergren further testified that the “final” deal at the time he agreed to “sign\naway” his lis pendens was “a million in cash and a 5 percent[]—a 5 percent profits\nparticipation.”3 According to Westergren, under this 5% profits participation, the\nPlank Parties would pay Westergren 5% of the profits, if any, that they realized\nupon selling or “flipping” the 190 acres to a third party.\n\n\n         3\n         According to Westergren, at some point after Russell Plank presented Westergren with\nthe profits interest agreement where Russell Plank hand-wrote in the 20% profit interest term,\nRussell Plank presented to Westergren another draft agreement that included the terms of the\n“cool million bucks and a 5 percent participation.”\n\n                                              4\n\f       After the mediation, because 190 acres was more land than the Plank Parties\nwere comfortable purchasing and developing, the Plank Parties held meetings with\nvarious companies to serve as potential partners, including ML Realty Partners, a\nChicago-based investment and development company interested in long-term real\nestate holdings. In January 2006, NPH entered into a contribution agreement with\nML Realty Partners. Under this agreement, upon NPH’s acquisition of the entire\n190 acres, ML Realty Partners would distribute $6 million to NPH.\n\n       On February 14, 2006, Westergren released his lis pendens and dismissed\nhis claim in the 190-acres litigation with prejudice.              Two days later, NPH\npurchased 20 of the 190 acres, and Port Crossing Land, L.P., a limited partnership\nin which the limited partners were an NPH-affiliated entity4 and ML Realty\nPartners, purchased the remaining 170 acres. The purchase price of the 190 acres\nwas approximately $.75 per square foot. ML Realty Partners distributed $6 million\nto NPH. In June 2006, NPH sold the 20-acre parcel to Del Piso Investments, an\nArizona limited partnership, for $1.742 million, or a purchase price of\napproximately $2 per square foot.5\n\n       At this time, Westergren still had not received any payment from the Plank\nParties, and started calling them. According to Westergren, Russell Plank finally\ntold him, “Look, we can’t give you the whole million right now but we’re going to\ngive you a half a million bucks.” Both Michael Plank and Russell Plank testified\nthat they agreed to pay Westergren $500,000. Westergren met with Russell Plank\nat the NPH office on June 30, 2006, at which time Russell Plank gave Westergren\na check for $500,000.6 Without reading it, Westergren also signed a two-page\n\n       4\n           This entity was NPH LaPorte Realty, L.P.\n       5\n         In December 2005, Arizona Tile, L.L.C. had entered into an earnest money contract for\nthe purchase of this 20 acres from NPH.\n       6\n           This $500,000 NPH check was co-signed by Russell Plank. In NPH’s accounting\n                                                5\n\fdocument entitled “Agreement and Release” (“Release”), which was notarized in\nWestergren’s presence. The Release was drafted by the Plank Parties’ attorneys,\nand the Plank Parties did not send the Release to or discuss it with Langston. The\nRelease stated that in exchange for “receipt” of the $500,000, Westergren released\nand relinquished any rights and interests in the 190 acres, and released all claims\nregarding the 190 acres against Michael Plank, NPH, and their agents. Westergren\ntestified that he did not read the document because he did not have his reading\nglasses7 with him and was “in a hurry.” Westergren admitted he was wearing a\nwatch with a built-in magnifying glass that he sometimes used to help him read.\nAccording to Westergren, after he asked what the document was, Russell Plank\ndescribed it as “just a receipt” and “nothing,” and told Westergren “you don’t have\nto worry about it.” Russell Plank did not tell Westergren that the document was a\nrelease. Westergren testified he relied on Russell Plank’s “representation” that the\ndocument was “just a receipt” in signing the Release.\n\n      In February 2007, Westergren sent a letter to Michael Plank to request the\nother $500,000 and his “5% interest.” Westergren and Michael Plank then met for\nlunch. Westergren testified that, during lunch, he found out about the Release and\nMichael Plank told Westergren “you need to read what you sign.” The Plank\nParties refused to pay Westergren any additional compensation. Westergren filed\nsuit against the Plank Parties, asserting various claims, including breach of\ncontract, breach of partnership duties, common-law fraud, and statutory fraud. The\nPlank Parties filed a counterclaim asserting that Westergren breached the MSA and\nthe Release by filing suit.\n\nrecords, this payment was approved by “R.D.P.” and initially described as for “Land-Fixed\nAsset.” Several months later, the description was changed to “Consulting Fees.”\n      7\n       Westergren had undergone ocular lens replacement due to leukemia and could not read\ndocuments without eyeglasses.\n\n                                            6\n\f       After a trial, the jury found the following:\n\n               Russell Plank agreed to pay Westergren $1 million and a 5% profit\n               interest in the development of the 190 acres in exchange for\n               Westergren’s releasing his lis pendens and giving up his contractual\n               right to the 190 acres.8\n               Russell Plank failed to comply with this agreement.\n               NPH, Michael Plank, and Russell Plank each partially performed the\n               agreement to pay Westergren $1 million and a 5% profit interest in the\n               development of the 190 acres.\n               Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his agreement was not\n               excused.9\n               The sum of $500,000, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably\n               would compensate Westergren for his damages that resulted from\n               Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his agreement, based upon the\n               difference between the amount Westergren received from the Plank\n               Parties and the amount Westergren would have received if the Plank\n               Parties had paid him the agreed-upon amount.\n               Each of the Plank Parties formed a partnership with Westergren.\n               Each of the Plank Parties failed to comply with its respective duty of\n               loyalty to Westergren and with its respective duty of care to\n               Westergren.10\n               These failures were not excused by Westergren’s later taking an\n               inconsistent position to the disadvantage of the Plank Parties.\n               The sum of $177,608, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably\n\n       8\n          The trial court granted partial directed verdict in favor of the Plank Parties, ruling that\nany allegation of fraud against NPH prior to the execution of the MSA was barred by the MSA’s\ndisclaimer of reliance. Westergren does not appeal this ruling. As a result of this ruling, the\nparties agreed that NPH would not be submitted as part of the breach-of-contract claim. The jury\ndid not find that Michael Plank individually entered into the oral agreement, and Westergren\ndoes not appeal this finding.\n       9\n         The jury was instructed on the Plank Parties’ affirmative defenses of prior material\nbreach, waiver, and quasi-estoppel.\n       10\n          The jury found that NPH was 50% responsible, Michael Plank was 25% responsible,\nand Russell Plank was 25% responsible for causing Westergren harm due to breach of\npartnership duties.\n\n                                                 7\n\f              would compensate Westergren for his damages that were proximately\n              caused by those breaches of partnership duties, based upon the\n              difference between the amount Westergren received from the Plank\n              Parties and the amount Westergren would have received if the Plank\n              Parties had paid him the agreed-upon amount.\n              NPH’s profit in the acquisition of the 190 acres was $3,552,174.\n              Each of the Plank Parties committed common-law fraud by\n              misrepresentation, common-law fraud by omission, and statutory\n              fraud against Westergren.11\n              The fraud by misrepresentation and statutory fraud were not excused\n              by Westergren’s later taking an inconsistent position to the\n              disadvantage of the Plank Parties.\n              Zero dollars, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably would\n              compensate Westergren for his damages, if any, that resulted from\n              such fraud, based upon the difference between the amount Westergren\n              received from the Plank Parties and the amount Westergren would\n              have received if the Plank Parties had paid him the agreed-upon\n              amount.\n              The amount of $200,000 would be a reasonable fee for the necessary\n              services of Westergren’s attorney for preparation and trial; $25,000,\n              for an appeal to the court of appeals; and $20,000, for a petition for\n              review to the Texas Supreme Court.\n              Westergren did not fail to comply with the MSA or the Release.\n\n       The Plank Parties filed a motion to disregard all the jury findings adverse to\nthem and requested a take-nothing judgment as to all of Westergren’s claims and\njudgment in favor of the Plank Parties on their counterclaims. 12 Westergren filed a\nmotion for judgment on the jury’s verdict and a motion for disgorgement of profits.\nThe trial court denied the Plank Parties’ their motion as to their counterclaims but\n\n       11\n         The jury found that NPH was 30% responsible, Michael Plank was 20% responsible,\nand Russell Plank was 50% responsible for causing Westergren harm due to common-law fraud\nby misrepresentation and statutory fraud.\n       12\n          This filing was styled as a motion to disregard the jury’s findings and for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict.\n\n                                              8\n\fgranted it as to Westergren’s claims against the Plank Parties. The trial court\ndenied Westergren’s motion for disgorgement of profits, granted Westergren’s\nmotion for judgment as to the Plank Parties’ counterclaims, and denied\nWestergren’s motion for judgment as to Westergren’s claims against the Plank\nParties. The trial court rendered judgment that Westergren take nothing on his\nclaims and that the Plank Parties take nothing on their claims, and charged\nWestergren with paying the Plank Parties’ costs of court.\n\n                           II.      ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      On appeal, Westergren presents five issues. First, Westergren argues that\nthe trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on\nhis breach-of-contract claim. Second, Westergren contends that the trial court\nerred in granting JNOV on his partnership claims. Third, Westergren argues that\nthe trial court similarly erred with regard to his fraud claims. Fourth, Westergren\ncomplains about the trial court’s denial of his request to amend his petition to add a\nnew defense. Finally, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in awarding\ncourt costs to the Plank Parties.\n\n      On cross-appeal, the Plank Parties present two issues.         First, the Plank\nParties argue that they conclusively proved (a) that Westergren breached the MSA\nand the Release by filing the underlying suit and (b) the amount of their resulting\ndamages, such that the trial court should have rendered judgment in their favor on\ntheir counterclaims. Second, the Plank Parties contend the jury’s finding that\nWestergren did not breach the MSA and the Release was against the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence such that the trial court should have granted the\nPlank Parties a new trial on their counterclaims. In a conditional cross-issue, the\nPlank Parties also assert that any recovery by Westergren must be capped at\n$200,000.\n\n                                          9\n\f                       III.       STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n      Judgment against a jury verdict is proper only when the law does not permit\nreasonable jurors to decide otherwise. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,\n823 (Tex. 2005). We therefore review JNOVs for legal sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the verdict, bearing in mind that it is the jury’s sole province to evaluate\nwitness credibility and determine the weight to attach to testimony.            Envtl.\nProcedures, Inc. v. Guidry, 282 S.W.3d 602, 626 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 2009, pet. denied) (citing City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819). We consider\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable\ninference that would support the challenged finding, crediting favorable evidence if\na reasonable fact finder could and disregarding contrary evidence unless a\nreasonable fact finder could not. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. We\ncannot substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact if the evidence falls\nwithin this zone of reasonable disagreement. Id. at 822. If the evidence viewed in\nthis light would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to find the challenged\nfact, then JNOV is improper. See id. at 823, 827. “We will uphold the jury’s\nfinding if more than a scintilla of competent evidence supports it.” Tanner v.\nNationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 289 S.W.3d 828, 830 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      In reviewing factual sufficiency, we must consider and weigh all the\nevidence. Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761–62 (Tex.\n2003). We can set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or if the finding\nis so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly\nwrong and manifestly unjust. Id. at 761. The jury as trier of fact is the sole judge\nof the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\nGTE Mobilnet of S. Tex.Ltd. P’ship v. Pascouet, 61 S.W.3d 599, 615–16 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). Thus, we may not substitute our\n\n                                          10\n\fown judgment for that of the fact finder, even if we would reach a different answer\non the evidence. Id. at 616. The amount of evidence necessary to affirm the fact\nfinder’s judgment is far less than that necessary to reverse its judgment. See id.\n\n                               IV.       ANALYSIS\n\n      A. Whether the trial court erred in disregarding the jury’s breach-of-\n         contract findings\n      In his first issue, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in rendering\nJNOV as to Westergren’s breach-of-contract claim. In their motion, the Plank\nParties asked the trial court to disregard the jury’s findings regarding the breach-\nof-contract claim based upon the following grounds: (1) Russell Plank cannot be\nheld liable for breach of contract as a matter of law because the evidence\nconclusively proves he was acting as an agent of NPH and did not assume any\npersonal liability; (2) any breach-of-contract claim was released under the MSA\nand the Release; (3) the alleged contract is unenforceable for lack of consideration;\n(4) any agreement reached before the MSA merged into and was superseded by the\nMSA; (5) the alleged contract is unenforceable because it is subject to the statute\nof frauds and the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s finding of the\npartial-performance exception to the statute of frauds; (6) because there is no\nlegally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s partial-performance finding and\nbecause the jury’s damages findings are based upon a benefit-of-the-bargain\nmeasure of damages, all of the damages findings fail under the statute of frauds;\n(7) the evidence conclusively establishes the affirmative defenses of waiver, prior\nmaterial breach, and quasi-estoppel; and (8) the evidence is legally insufficient to\nsupport the jury’s findings that Russell Plank entered into the alleged oral\nagreement with Westergren, that Russell Plank failed to comply with this\nagreement, and as to Westergren’s damages resulting from that failure to comply.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      The trial court granted the Plank Parties’ motion to disregard the jury\nfindings regarding the breach-of-contract claim without specifying the grounds\nupon which it relied. Therefore, on appeal, Westergren must show that each\nindependent ground fairly asserted against the breach-of-contract claim does not\nprovide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment as to this claim. See Fort\nBend Cty. Drainage Dist. v. Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d 392, 394 (Tex. 1991).\n\n           1. Westergren addressed all the JNOV breach-of-contract bases\n              fairly presented by the Plank Parties.\n      As an initial matter, the Plank Parties assert that we can affirm JNOV on\nWestergren’s breach-of-contract claim due to Westergren’s alleged failure to\naddress one of the Plank Parties’ alleged JNOV grounds. We disagree. In their\nJNOV motion, instead of arguing that partial performance is an equitable doctrine\nunder which a party only may recover reliance damages for breach of contract, as\nthey do in their appellate brief, the Plank Parties merely coupled the lack of legally\nsufficient evidence of partial performance with the lack of a damages question\nbased on reliance damages to argue that all of Westergren’s damages findings fail\n(ground 6 above). The Plank Parties did not directly attack the jury’s finding on\nbreach-of-contract damages. In addition, in their JNOV motion, the Plank Parties\nonly cited cases dealing with non-contract causes of action.13\n\n      While the Plank Parties cited Exxon Corp. v. Breezevale Ltd. in the brief in\nsupport of their motion for JNOV, they cited it for the propositions that the partial-\nperformance exception to the statute of frauds was inapplicable and that, because\nthe statute of frauds rendered the alleged oral partnership agreement unenforceable,\nthe Plank Parties could not be liable for any damages resulting from breach of\n\n\n      13\n          See, e.g., Baylor Univ. v. Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d 632, 636 (Tex. 2007); Haase v.\nGlazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 799 (Tex. 2001).\n\n                                           12\n\fpartnership duties. See 82 S.W.3d 429, 439–40, 443 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2002, pet.\ndenied). The Plank Parties first cited Exxon for the proposition that even when the\npartial-performance exception applies, benefit-of-the-bargain damages are not\nrecoverable at all in a letter written to the trial court, filed the day after the trial\ncourt entered its final judgment. See id. at 441. Although the Plank Parties may\nhave presented this argument orally at the JNOV hearing, the transcript, if any,\nfrom the hearing is not in the record. In any event, we should consider only\ngrounds stated in writing to support the motion. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301 (“[U]pon\nmotion and reasonable notice the court may render judgment non obstante\nveredicto if a directed verdict would have been proper . . . .”); Olin Corp. v. Cargo\nCarriers, Inc., 673 S.W.2d 211, 213–14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984,\nno writ) (concluding that trial court had no power to enter JNOV absent a proper\nmotion to do so). Thus, we conclude that Westergren addressed all the JNOV\ngrounds fairly presented to the trial court on his breach-of-contract claim, and we\nproceed to the appeal’s merits. See Garza v. Cantu, —S.W.3d—, No. 14-11-\n00724-CV, 2013 WL 1460521, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] June 13,\n2013, no pet. h.) (op. on reh’g) (overruling appellee’s contention that JNOV be\nconfirmed due to appellant’s alleged failure to attack one JNOV basis).\n\n            2. The evidence is legally sufficient to support Russell Plank’s\n               individual liability on the contract.\n       The Plank Parties did not plead agency14 as an affirmative defense to\nWestergren’s breach-of-contract claim. However, in their JNOV motion, the Plank\nParties argued Westergren failed to establish that his breach-of-contract claim\narose against Russell Plank in his individual capacity because the evidence\n       14\n           To avoid individual liability under the agency defense, a party must prove that he\ndisclosed his agency capacity to the other contracting party and that he identified the true\nprincipal for which he was acting. Gordon v. Leasman, 365 S.W.3d 109, 114–15 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n                                             13\n\fconclusively establishes Russell Plank acted solely as an agent for NPH.15 Thus, to\nmerit the trial court’s JNOV, the Plank Parties were required to show the evidence\nconclusively proves that Russell Plank did not enter into the oral agreement with\nWestergren in Russell Plank’s individual capacity and that no reasonable jury was\nfree to think otherwise. See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830.\n\n       Westergren argues that even if Russell Plank did act at times as an agent for\nNPH, this does not mean Russell Plank was acting solely as an agent and never at\nall in his individual capacity when he made promises to Westergren. Westergren\ncontends that the trial record shows Russell Plank wore “multiple hats,” including\none as Russell Plank, individual. We agree. Russell Plank admitted that at times\nhe dealt with Westergren as an independent consultant:\n\n       Q. When you dealt with Mr. Westergren, were you dealing with him\n       as an independent consultant, or were you dealing with him as a\n       representative of National Property Holdings, or were you dealing\n       with him as a representative of the Plank Companies, Inc.?\n       A. All of the above. I’m a consultant that works for all of those\n       entities.\nRussell Plank testified that he was strictly an independent consultant for, and was\nnot a partner and did not have any ownership interests in, Michael Plank’s\ncompanies. Russell Plank denied that he had any authority to act on behalf of\nNPH—“Mike makes all decisions” with regard to NPH. Russell Plank only was\nauthorized to act on behalf of NPH by Michael Plank on “some specific issues.”\nMichael Plank confirmed that Russell Plank was a consultant for NPH and\n\n       15\n           In support, the Plank Parties relied on Walker Insurance Services v. Bottle Rock Power\nCorp., 108 S.W.3d 538, 554 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.). But Walker has\nlimited, if any, applicability because the issue was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\ntrial court’s implied finding regarding agency on a special appearance. This court specifically\nindicated “when determining whether an agency relationship existed . . . , we must be mindful\nthat the issue of ultimate liability is separate from the issue of jurisdiction.” Id. at 549.\n\n                                                14\n\fWestergren was told that. Westergren testified that he dealt extensively with and\nhad been in constant contact by cell phone with Russell Plank; Russell Plank\nagreed that he spoke to Westergren “much more” than Michael Plank did.\nWestergren and Langston both testified that their discussions regarding the $1\nmillion and profits-interest “deal” were with Russell Plank. Russell Plank called\nLangston regarding paying Westergren’s attorney’s fees in the 190-acres litigation\nbecause they were going to be “partners.” And Russell Plank admitted that he\n“personally” wrote a $5000 check to Langston. Westergren further testified it was\nRussell Plank who called to tell him that it was time to release the lis pendens.\n\n      Although Russell Plank at times may have acted as NPH’s agent, an agent is\nnot precluded from binding himself on a contract where he has pledged his own\npersonal responsibility in addition to that of his principal. See Nagle v. Duncan,\n570 S.W.2d 116, 117 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1978, writ dism’d).\nAnd while the Plank Parties emphasize the fact that the $500,000 check paid to\nWestergren in June 2006 was issued by NPH, circumstances post contract\nformation do not relieve an agent from a finding of personal contract liability. See\nGordon v. Leasman, 365 S.W.3d 109, 115 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011,\nno pet.) (concluding such in case involving oral agreement for carpentry services\nwhere invoices were addressed to and checks issued by principal).\n\n      Based on all the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract,\nthere is more than a scintilla of probative evidence that Russell Plank acted in his\nindividual capacity with regard to the oral agreement with Westergren.              See\nTanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe jury’s finding, Westergren clearly established a fact issue as to whether Russell\nPlank was bound on the oral agreement with Westergren in Russell Plank’s\nindividual capacity. Because reasonable and fair-minded people could find the\n\n                                          15\n\fchallenged fact, if the trial court granted JNOV based on this ground, it was\nimproper. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, this ground does not\nprovide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment on breach of contract. See\nSbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n           3. The evidence is legally sufficient to support that Westergren did\n              not release his breach-of-contract claim under the MSA and the\n              Release.\n      In their motion for JNOV, the Plank Parties argued that any breach-of-\ncontract claim was released under both the terms of the MSA and the Release. The\njury found that Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his oral agreement with\nWestergren was not excused by any waiver by Westergren. In addition, the jury\nfound that each of the Plank Parties committed fraud by omission. Finally, the jury\nfound no breach of contract by Westergren with regard to either the MSA or the\nRelease.\n\n             a. The January 2006 MSA\n\n      First, we will consider whether the MSA applies to bar Westergren’s breach-\nof-contract claim. The Plank Parties argued that the evidence conclusively showed\nthat Westergren’s contract claim fell within the MSA’s broad language and thus\nwas barred as a matter of law. The Plank Parties further asserted that Russell\nPlank was covered by the MSA because at all times he acted as an agent on behalf\nof NPH.\n\n      On appeal, Westergren contends that the MSA did not release any claims\nagainst Russell Plank because the MSA fails to refer to Russell Plank with any\n“descriptive particularity or otherwise,” and thus the Plank Parties’ argument could\nnot have formed the basis for the trial court’s JNOV.\n\n      The MSA included the following language:\n\n                                        16\n\f       [A]ll parties to this Agreement agree to release, discharge any and all\n       claims, demands or suits, known or unknown, fixed or contingent,\n       liquidated or unliquidated, whether or not asserted in the above case,\n       as of this date, arising from, or related to, the events and transactions\n       which are the subject matter of this case.\nWhile “all parties” to the MSA agreed to release and discharge “any and all\nclaims” related to the “subject matter” of the 190-acres litigation, and NPH was a\nsignatory party to the MSA, there is no dispute that Russell Plank individually did\nnot sign and was not a party to the MSA. Nor does the MSA specifically refer in\nany way to the parties’ agents; certainly, nothing expressly indicates that the\nparties to the MSA intended to release Russell Plank from any and all claims.\n\n       Moreover, even assuming solely for purposes of our analysis that the MSA\nwould cover claims against agents of signatory parties, we already have concluded\nmore than a scintilla of evidence would support a reasonable jury’s finding that\nRussell Plank acted in his individual capacity, not solely as an agent for NPH, to be\nbound personally on the oral agreement with Westergren.                   See supra Section\nIV.A.2. Thus, the Plank Parties’ reliance on cases in which releases were found to\nreach a company’s employees or agents who were clearly acting in the scope of\ntheir employment or agency is misplaced.16 We therefore conclude that, viewing it\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence raised a fact issue as to\nwhether the MSA even was valid as to Russell Plank. A reasonable and fair-\nminded jury was permitted to conclude that Westergren did not release his contract\n\n       16\n           Vera v. N. Star Dodge Sales, Inc., 989 S.W.2d 13, 18 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998,\nno pet.) (concluding release reached car dealership employees where plaintiffs did not allege any\nindividual cause of action against employees and there was no question that employees were\nassociated with dealership’s sale of car at issue); Winkler v. Kirkwood Atrium Office Park, 816\nS.W.2d 111, 113–14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied) (concluding\nindividuals associated with and “involved in the operation, maintenance, and administration of\n[fitness] center” were included in release that released “the Club” from liability for injuries\nsuffered during participation in fitness programs).\n\n                                               17\n\fclaim against Russell Plank in the MSA. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823,\n827. Thus, this subground does not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s\njudgment on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n            b. The June 2006 Release\n\n      The Plank Parties also argued that Westergren released his breach-of-\ncontract claim under the Release. The Plank Parties complained that Westergren\nfailed to present any evidence of fraud by omission, and therefore, Westergren’s\nfraudulent-inducement defense to the Release fails as a matter of law. Specifically,\nthe Plank Parties argued that Westergren failed to obtain a relevant jury finding\nbecause the only basis presented for his fraudulent-inducement defense was not\nfraud by omission, but rather fraud by misrepresentation.         Further, even if\nWestergren had obtained a relevant jury finding as to fraud by misrepresentation,\nthe Plank Parties argued that Westergren justifiably could not rely on the Plank\nParties’ alleged misrepresentation that the release was a “receipt.” Finally, the\nPlank Parties asserted that the plain language of the Release bars Westergren’s\ncontract claim because it covers agents of Michael Plank and NPH, and at all times\nRussell Plank was acting in such an agency capacity.\n\n      On appeal, Westergren argues the evidence shows that Westergren’s\nsignature on the Release was procured by fraud and the jury’s findings are\nconsistent with and support Westergren’s fraudulent-inducement defense.\nSpecifically, the evidence shows Russell Plank did not disclose that the document\nwas actually a release; Russell Plank knew that Westergren was ignorant of that\nfact and did not have an equal opportunity to discover it because he did not have\nhis glasses; Russell Plank induced him into signing the Release by failing to reveal\nits true nature; and Westergren suffered injury as a result when the Release was\nlater used as the reason to avoid additional payment.    Westergren further argues\n\n                                        18\n\fthat the Release does not cover Russell Plank; he is not specifically mentioned in\nthe Release and, at trial, Russell Plank testified that he was “not a party\nindividually” to the Release.\n\n       Here, the trial court submitted various fraud questions17 to the jury with the\nfollowing understanding: “that plaintiff is seeking damages for material\nmisrepresentation and is alleging fraud by omission as the theory for its\nfraudulent[-]inducement defense to the enforcement of the June 2006 release.”18\nWestergren offered no objection to this characterization of his case to be presented\nin the charge. Thus, question 14 on fraud by omission was submitted as the\nquestion pertinent to whether the Release was “subject to avoidance” on the\nground of fraudulent inducement. See Williams v. Glash, 789 S.W.2d 261, 264\n(Tex. 1990) (“Under Texas law, a release is a contract and is subject to avoidance,\non grounds such as fraud or mistake, just like any other contract.”); see also\nSpoljaric v. Percival Tours, Inc., 708 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex. 1986) (explaining that\nsilence is equivalent to false representation where circumstances impose duty to\nspeak and one deliberately remains silent); Solutioneers Consulting, Ltd. v. Gulf\nGreyhound Partners, Ltd., 237 S.W.3d 379, 385 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2007, no pet.) (“Fraud by omission is a subcategory of fraud because an omission\nor non-disclosure may be as misleading as a positive misrepresentation of fact\nwhen a party has a duty to disclose.”). Question 14 provided:\n\n       Did any of the parties listed below commit fraud against Gordon\n       Westergren?\n\n       17\n          Question 13 covered fraud by affirmative misrepresentation, question 14 covered fraud\nby omission, and question 15 covered statutory fraud involving real estate. Question 19, the\ndamages question associated with the fraud claims, was predicated on an affirmative answer to\nquestion 13 or 15.\n       18\n          The trial court previously had denied the Plank Parties’ motion for summary judgment\nbased on the Release.\n\n                                              19\n\f            Fraud occurs when:\n                   a) a party fails to disclose a material fact within the\n                      knowledge of the party,\n                   b) the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the\n                      fact and does not have an equal opportunity to\n                      discover the truth,\n                   c) the party intends to induce the other party to take\n                      some action by failing to disclose the fact, and\n                   d) the other party suffers injury as a result of acting\n                      without knowledge of the undisclosed fact.\n\n      On question 14, the jury answered “yes” with respect to each of NPH,\nMichael Plank, and Russell Plank. We disagree that Westergren failed to present\nany evidence of fraud by omission. Russell Plank testified that the Release was\ndrafted by the Plank Parties’ attorneys, not by Westergren, and Russell Plank read\nand approved it before having Westergren sign it. Westergren testified that Russell\nPlank called him and told him that he should come to the NPH office to pick up the\nfirst half of the million dollars. Russell Plank was aware that Westergren had\n“eyesight problems.” Westergren testified that he did not take his reading glasses\nwhen he went to pick up his check, that Westergren could not read the document\nRussell Plank “needed” him to sign, but after Westergren asked Russell Plank\n“[w]hat’s that?”, Russell Plank told Westergren he was signing “nothing,” “just a\nreceipt,” and he did not “have to worry about it.” Westergren testified what\nRussell Plank did not tell him was that the document was a “release of all claims.”\nWestergren testified he “absolutely” relied on the fact that Russell Plank told\nWestergren the document was “just a receipt” without telling him it was a release\nin executing and signing the Release. Russell Plank testified, “We put things in\n[the Release] because we—we just didn’t—we didn’t—Gordon was a loose\ncannon. We had no idea what he was capable of.” Westergren testified that as he\nleft this meeting, Russell Plank told Westergren he would receive “the other half”\n                                        20\n\fwhen “we get another building coming out of the ground.” Westergren did not\nknow that what he signed was a release until he met with Michael Plank who told\nhim “you need to read what you sign” and that he would not pay Westergren “an\nf’ing dime” more. Westergren never received the other $500,000 and 5% profit\ninterest.\n\n       In addition, Russell Plank, after working directly with the Plank Parties’\nattorneys on drafting the Release, never provided Westergren’s attorney Langston\nwith a copy of the Release before asking Westergren to sign it. This is despite the\nfacts that Russell Plank knew Langston represented Westergren in legal matters\nrelated to the 190 acres, Russell Plank personally had written a $5000 check to pay\nWestergren’s attorney’s fees in connection with the 190 acres, and Langston had\n“many thousand[s]” of discussions with Russell Plank about putting the oral\nagreement with Westergren related to the 190 acres—the very reason why\nWestergren signed the MSA and released his lis pendens—in writing. This is also\ndespite the facts that the document Russell Plank conditioned receiving the\n$500,000 check on was a “professional” attorney-drafted agreement regarding and\nrelease of Westergren’s legal claims related to the 190 acres; Russell Plank had his\nattorneys “put things” in the Release because he “had no idea what [Westergren]\nwas capable of”; and that the custom and practice of communications among\nattorneys is to deal strictly with the attorney representing “the other guy’s client,”\nwhich includes providing that attorney with copies of documents.            Langston\ntestified that he was unable to advise Westergren about his legal rights under the\ndocument because he did not receive a copy of it until almost a year after\nWestergren signed it, and that the first thing Langston said when he read the\nRelease was “[s]omething like, Oh my god.” Although Westergren generally was\na “handshake” deal man, Russell Plank certainly knew Westergren had retained\n\n\n                                         21\n\fcounsel for matters related to the 190 acres. Russell Plank’s actions in connection\nwith the Release thus provide ample circumstantial evidence of his intent to\ndefraud Westergren. See Anderson, Greenwood & Co. v. Martin, 44 S.W.3d 200,\n215 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).\n\n       In their JNOV motion, the Plank Parties cited First City Mortgage Co v.\nGillis, for the proposition that Russell Plank had no duty as a fiduciary to disclose\nthe Release’s unambiguous terms and Westergren was obligated as a principal to\nread the Release before he signed it. See 694 S.W.2d 144, 146–47 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.).19 However, in First City Mortgage,\nwe expressly recognized fraud as a possible basis to excuse a party’s obligation to\nread a document prior to signing. Id. at 147 (“If no fraud is involved, one who\nsigns an agreement without knowledge of its contents is presumed to have\nconsented to its terms and is charged with knowledge of the agreement's legal\neffect.”).20    Moreover, there need not be a fiduciary relationship between the\nparties to support fraud by omission.21 See Solutioneers Consulting, 237 S.W.3d at\n\n       19\n         First City Mortgage involved a broker-principal fiduciary relationship in the context of\nan attempt to secure financing.\n       20\n          In their appellate brief, the Plank Parties also rely on Bradford v. Vento, where the\nTexas Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff’s fraud-by-omission claim failed because there\nwas no evidence that the defendant “knew that [the plaintiff] lacked information and did not have\n‘an equal opportunity to discover the truth.’” 48 S.W.3d 749, 756 (Tex. 2001). Bradford is\ndistinguishable because, here, after coming in to purportedly receive the first half of the million\ndollars, Westergren expressly asked Russell Plank what Westergren was signing, and there was\nevidence that Westergren had not brought his reading glasses and that Russell Plank knew\nWestergren needed glasses to read documents. Further, the fact that Russell Plank proceeded to\njoke about Westergren’s not spending all of the $500,000 check quickly just in case Russell\nPlank would not be able to give Westergren his other half—after Westergren already had signed\nthe Release—constitutes evidence that Russell Plank knew Westergren was ignorant of and\nlacked information about the Release’s terms. And the fact that, after consulting with the Plank\nParties’ own attorneys on the Release, Russell Plank did not provide Westergren’s attorney with\na copy of the Release reasonably supports an inference that Russell Plank knew Westergren did\nnot have an “equal opportunity to discover the truth” of the Release’s terms.\n       21\n            In their JNOV motion, the Plank Parties did not argue that Westergren failed to show\n                                                22\n\f385 (explaining that duty to disclose also may arise “when one party voluntarily\ndiscloses information, which gives rise to the duty to disclose the whole truth,”\n“when one party makes a representation, which gives rise to the duty to disclose\nnew information that the party is aware makes the earlier representation misleading\nor untrue,” or “when one party makes a partial disclosure and conveys a false\nimpression, which gives rise to the duty to speak”).          Where Russell Plank,\nindividually, and Westergren had entered into an alleged oral agreement; where\nRussell Plank had made representations that he would pay Westergren $1 million\nand a 5% profit interest in the sale of the 190 acres; where Russell Plank knew that\nWestergren was represented by counsel in matters related to the 190 acres; where\nRussell Plank had directly worked with his attorneys to draft a document that\nwould release all of Westergren’s claims in the 190 acres; where Russell Plank did\nnot provide a copy of the Release to Langston; and where Russell Plank answered\nWestergren’s direct question as to what he was signing with it was a “just a\nreceipt” for the $500,000 and did not tell him it actually included a release of all\nclaims, Russell Plank had a duty to disclose that he would pay only $500,000 for\nWestergren’s releasing all his claims as the whole truth, because he was aware this\nnew information made his earlier representations misleading or untrue, and to\navoid conveying a false impression See id.\n\n       Here, the evidence indicates that Russell Plank called Westergren in to\nreceive the first half of his “cool million”; presented Westergren with a document\n“drawn by professionals” and that Russell Plank had approved without first\nsending a copy to Westergren’s attorney for his review; told Westergren that he\n“needed” to sign it; after being expressly asked by Westergren what he was\nsigning, told him it was “just a receipt” and did not disclose that it was an agreement\n\nany other basis for Russell Plank’s duty to disclose.\n\n                                                23\n\fand included a release of all claims; and continued to refer to the existence of the\noral agreement he had with Westergren even after the Release was signed. From\nRussell Plank’s actions, a reasonable jury was free to infer he knew and had\nconcealed or failed to disclose the material fact that the document was a release of\nWestergren’s claims; he knew Westergren did not know that the document was a\nrelease and did not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth; he intended to\ninduce Westergren to sign the Release by deliberately failing to disclose that fact;\nand Westergren was injured by signing the document without knowing it was a\nrelease. In other words, that Russell Plank induced Westergren into signing the\nRelease by committing fraud by omission or nondisclosure. Therefore, based on\nour review of the evidence in the light most favorable to, and indulging every\nreasonable inference that would support, the jury’s affirmative finding, we\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence upon which a reasonable and\nfair-minded jury could conclude Westergren had proven each of the elements of\nfraud by omission as to Russell Plank. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823,\n827.22 Because we conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence to support\n\n       22\n          Because we conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\naffirmative finding on fraud by omission with regard to Russell Plank and this jury finding\nserves in support of Westergren’s defense to the Release, to finally dispose of this appeal, we\nneed not address the Plank Parties’ contention on JNOV that even if the jury’s findings on fraud\nby misrepresentation within another fraud question could support Westergren’s fraudulent-\ninducement defense, Westergren justifiably could not rely on the alleged “receipt”\nmisrepresentation as a matter of law because he failed to read the Release. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n47.1. In any event, this situation is distinguishable from that addressed by the en banc court in\nDRC Parts & Accessories, L.L.C. v. VM Motori, S.p.A., because there the plaintiff alleged the\ndefendant breached the written contract at issue and, in the alternative, alleged that the defendant\nfraudulently induced it to enter into that contract through affirmative misrepresentation. 112\nS.W.3d 856, 856 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied). There was no dispute\nthat the parties “agreed to continue the relationship” in the form of a written agreement. Id.\nHarvey v. Elder, cited by the dissent but not the Plank Parties, also does not control in these\ncircumstances because there the patient who signed the release of claims at issue testified she\nwas aware “that [the doctor] had prepared a release” of her payment note and that the notary\nasked her before she signed if she understood the document, and she replied she did. 191\nS.W.2d 686, 689 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1945, writ ref’d). Moreover, there is no\n                                                24\n\fWestergren’s defense of fraudulent inducement to the Release, this subground also\ndoes not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment on breach of\ncontract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\nindication the patient required glasses to read what she signed, that the patient expressly asked\nthe doctor what she was signing, or that the doctor described the document as “just a receipt” and\n“nothing.” Nor was the patient already represented by counsel in matters connected to the claims\nshe released. In contrast, Westergren’s position—as his defense to the Release—is that he did\nnot even know he was entering into any written agreement, much less a release of his claims\nrelated to the 190 acres, due to Russell Plank’s fraud. A party is not charged as a matter of law\nwith knowledge of a document’s unread provisions where “he can demonstrate that he was\ntricked into its execution.” See DeClaire v. G & B McIntosh Family Ltd. P’ship, 260 S.W.3d 34,\n47 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (citing Town North Nat’l Bank v. Broaddus,\n569 S.W.2d 489, 492 (Tex. 1978)). Moreover, justifiable reliance generally is a question of fact.\nSee 1001 McKinney Ltd. v. Credit Suisse First Boston Mortg. Capital, 192 S.W.3d 20, 30 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied). Here, Westergren testified, and the jury\nreasonably could have concluded, that Westergren justifiably relied on Russell Plank’s “trickery”\nin failing to disclose that what Westergren was signing included a release of all claims, and was\nnot “just a receipt,” after Westergren expressly asked Russell Plank what he was signing, when it\nanswered “yes” to question 14. And one need not show that he was prevented from reading or\nphysically forced to sign a contract to successfully assert fraudulent inducement. See Amouri v.\nSw. Toyota, Inc., 20 S.W.3d 165, 170 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2000, pet. denied) (plaintiff did\nnot read but signed lease thinking he bought vehicle). The Plank Parties’ other cited cases are\nlikewise distinguishable. See In re Lyon Fin. Servs., 257 S.W.3d 228, 232 (Tex. 2008) (plaintiff\nadmitted awareness of the forum-selection clause but claimed relator had represented it only\napplied to portion of agreement not sued upon); In re MHI P’ship, Ltd., No. 14-07-00851-CV,\n2008 WL 2262157, at *3, 5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 29, 2008, orig. proceeding,\nno pet.) (mem. op.) (homeowners admitted awareness of arbitration provisions in earnest money\ncontracts; also noting “strongly favored status” of arbitration). Further, the written agreement in\nLyon Financial, unlike the Release, “clearly set[] out that there were no representations between\nthe parties not set out in the agreement.” See 257 S.W.3d at 232.\n        Similarly, in concluding that legally sufficient evidence exists to support Westergren’s\nfraudulent-inducement defense, we presumed the Release to be valid and thus need not address\nthe Plank Parties’ contention on JNOV that the Release covered Russell Plank as a matter of law\nto finally dispose of this appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1. In any event, while Michael Plank\nand NPH and their agents are specifically mentioned in the Release, Russell Plank is not.\nFurther, Russell Plank admitted that he was “not a party individually” to the Release, and that\nwhile the Release mentioned “entities that I work with . . . and represent, . . . I’m not written on\nhere. I’m not personally drawn.” Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s\nfinding that Russell Plank acted and was bound in his individual capacity on the oral agreement,\nand where the evidence indicates Russell Plank continued to wear his “individual” hat in his\ndealings with Westergren, we cannot agree with the Plank Parties that the Release covered\nRussell Plank as a matter of law to preclude Westergren’s fraudulent-inducement defense and\nvoid the jury’s affirmative finding.\n\n                                                25\n\f            4. The evidence is legally sufficient to support that consideration\n               existed for Russell Plank’s contract with Westergren.\n       In their motion for JNOV, the Plank Parties argued any alleged oral\nagreement reached after the execution of the MSA fails for lack of consideration.23\nOn appeal, Westergren contends that the evidence does not show the oral\nagreement with Russell Plank was reached after the MSA, but rather the agreement\npredated the MSA and was Westergren’s only incentive to agree to the MSA.\n\n       Generally, a contract must be supported by consideration to be enforceable.\nMcLernon v. Dynegy, Inc., 347 S.W.3d 315, 335 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2011, no pet.) (citing Alex Sheshunoff Mgmt. Servs., L.P. v. Johnson, 209 S.W.3d\n644, 659 (Tex. 2006)). Consideration consists of either a benefit to the promisor or\na detriment to the promisee. See Roark v. Stallworth Oil & Gas, Inc., 813 S.W.2d\n492, 496 (Tex. 1991). It is a present exchange bargained for in return for a\npromise. Id. It may consist of some right, interest, or profit, or benefit that accrues\nto one party, or, alternatively, of some forbearance, loss or responsibility that is\nundertaken or incurred by the other party. Angelou v. African Overseas Union, 33\nS.W.3d 269, 280 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n       Here, Westergren testified that Russell Plank promised to make Westergren\nhis partner and pay Westergren $1 million and a 5% profit interest in the sale of the\n190 acres in exchange for Westergren’s promise to release his lis pendens and\ncontractual rights to the 190 acres. Westergren presented evidence that Russell\nPlank’s promises induced Westergren, to his detriment, to agree in the MSA to\n       23\n           In their appellate brief, the Plank Parties apparently recognize that their JNOV\nargument and cited cases do not apply because Westergren “conceded” that the alleged promise\nby Russell Plank predated the MSA. However, because in their motion for JNOV, the Plank\nParties asserted that the contract claim fails “because any contract was unenforceable for lack of\nconsideration” and because the trial court did not specify upon what ground it decided to grant\nJNOV, we consider whether any oral agreement predating the MSA is supported by\nconsideration.\n\n                                               26\n\frelease his lis pendens and his contractual rights to the 190 acres and then to\nactually release the lis pendens and dismiss the 190-acres litigation with prejudice.\nAccording to Westergren, Russell Plank’s promises “caused [Westergren] to give\nthem control of the property” and induced him to “walk away” from the mediation\n“without getting anything”—“[W]e had a partnership, a deal to march on down.\nThat’s why I took zero.” Langston testified that both Westergren and Russell\nPlank provided “identical” details regarding their agreement and exchange of\npromises.\n\n      The jury found that Russell Plank agreed to pay Westergren $1 million and a\n5% profit interest in the 190 acres in exchange for Westergren’s releasing his lis\npendens and giving up his contractual right to the property. Based on our review\nof the evidence in the light most favorable to this finding, we conclude the\nevidence at least raised a fact issue as to the existence of consideration, which\nwould allow a reasonable and fair-minded jury to find that a contract existed. See\nCity of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, this ground does not provide a basis\nfor affirming the trial court’s judgment on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n            5. The evidence is legally sufficient to support that the oral\n               agreement entered into by Westergren and Russell Plank did not\n               merge into the MSA.\n      In their motion for JNOV, the Plank Parties argued that Westergren’s\ncontract claim fails as a matter of law because any agreement reached prior to the\nMSA merged into and was superseded by the MSA. Westergren argues on appeal\nthat the merger doctrine does not apply because Russell Plank individually was not\na party to the MSA.\n\n      A “merger clause” is a contractual provision mandating that the written\n\n\n                                         27\n\fterms of the contract may not be varied by prior agreements because all such\nagreements have been merged into the new document. IKON Office Solutions, Inc.\nv. Eifert, 125 S.W.3d 113, 125 & n.6 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet.\ndenied) (concluding statements that document “constitutes the entire agreement\nconcerning the subject matter hereof” and “supercedes prior . . . agreements” were\nmerger clauses). “A merger occurs when the same parties to an earlier agreement\nlater enter into a written integrated agreement covering the same subject matter.”\nSuperior Laminate & Supply, Inc. v. Formica Corp., 93 S.W.3d 445, 448–49 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (citing Fish v. Tandy Corp., 948\nS.W.2d 886, 898 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1997, writ denied)).\n\n       Here, the MSA contains a merger clause: “this Agreement constitutes the\nentire agreement between and among [the parties], and supersedes any prior or\ncontemporaneous representations, statements, understandings or agreements\nconcerning the subject matter of this Agreement.” However, no merger occurred\nbecause the parties to the MSA are not the same as those to the oral agreement.\nWhile Westergren was a signatory party to the MSA, there is no dispute that\nRussell Plank individually did not sign and was not a party to the MSA. And we\nalready have determined there is legally sufficient evidence to support that the oral\nagreement at issue was entered into between Russell Plank, individually, and\nWestergren. Thus, as a matter of law, the oral agreement and the MSA “cannot\nmerge because the two agreements are between different parties.” See Fish, 948\nS.W.2d at 899.24 None of the cases cited by the Plank Parties indicates otherwise;\nindeed, all the agreements at issue involved the same exact parties.25\n\n\n       24\n           In Fish, the earlier letter agreement at issue was between a corporation and an\nindividual, while the later distribution agreement was between two corporations. 948 S.W.2d at\n899.\n       25\n            Bandera Drilling Co. v.

See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, this ground does\nnot provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment on breach of contract.\nSee Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n            6. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s finding of\n               partial performance.\n       The Plank Parties asserted in their motion for JNOV that any alleged oral\nagreement is unenforceable under the statute of frauds because Westergren did not\nmeet his burden to establish the partial-performance exception to the statute of\nfrauds. Specifically, the Plank Parties argued that the evidence conclusively shows\nWestergren had another reason to release his interest in the 190 acres and the Plank\nParties had another reason to pay Westergren, such that there was no evidence their\nconduct was “unequivocally referable” to the alleged oral agreement. The Plank\nParties further argued there was no evidence that enforcement of the statute of\nfrauds would amount to a “virtual fraud.”\n\n       On appeal, Westergren emphasizes that partial performance is a fact\nquestion to be determined by the jury.26 Westergren argues the evidence shows\nthat he received nothing in the MSA and had no incentive to release his interest\nother than Russell Plank’s oral promises. Further, Westergren contends that the\n\n\n2009, no pet.); Yasuda Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Sompo Japan Ins. Co., 225 S.W.3d 894 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.); Fisher Controls Int’l, Inc. v. Gibbons, 911 S.W.2d\n135 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied).\n       26\n           On appeal, Westergren does not argue that the oral agreement is not subject to the\nstatute of frauds at all, but rather that the partial-performance exception applies. Thus, for\npurposes of our analysis, we presume, without deciding, that the oral agreement would be subject\nto the statute of frauds, barring any exception.\n\n                                              29\n\fcircumstances surrounding the $500,000 payment, including that the check initially\nwas described for “Land-Fixed Asset,” are unequivocally referable to Russell\nPlank’s oral agreement to pay Westergren $1 million plus 5% profit interest.\n\n      Partial performance is an exception to the statute of frauds. Exxon, 82\nS.W.3d at 439. Under the partial-performance exception, an agreement that does\nnot satisfy the statute of frauds but that has been partially performed may be\nenforced if denying enforcement would itself amount to a virtual fraud.            Id.\nVirtual fraud here would mean that because of his reliance on the contract,\nWestergren has suffered a substantial detriment for which he has no adequate\nremedy, and the Plank Parties would reap an unearned benefit if permitted to\ninvoke the statute of frauds.    See id.        However, the acts constituting partial\nperformance must be “unequivocally referable to the agreement and corroborative\nof the fact that a contract actually was made.” Id. “Actions relied on to establish\nthe partial-performance exception to the statute of frauds must be such as could\nhave been done with no other design than to fulfill the particular agreement sought\nto be enforced; otherwise, they do not tend to prove the existence of the parol\nagreement relied on by the plaintiff.” Bookout v. Bookout, 165 S.W.3d 904, 907–\n08 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (citing Exxon, 82 S.W.3d at 439). The\nparty claiming a partial-performance exception to the statute of frauds generally\nmust secure a jury finding. Id. at 908 (citing Barbouti v. Munden, 866 S.W.2d 288,\n295 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, writ denied)).                 Whether the\nperformance that has occurred is sufficient to establish the exception is a question\nof fact. Id. at 910.\n\n      The jury found that Russell Plank agreed to pay Westergren $1 million and a\n5% profit interest in the development of the 190 acres. The jury further found\nRussell Plank partially performed that agreement.\n\n                                           30\n\f      Here, Westergren testified that the only reason he agreed to “walk away”\nfrom the mediation for “nothing” and sign the MSA was because Russell Plank had\npromised to make him a partner and pay him $1 million and a 5% profit interest for\nreleasing his lis pendens and claim to the 190 acres. Russell Plank told Westergren\n“not to worry,” that they just needed to “get these guys out of the way” by way of\nthe mediation and the MSA. Westergren “absolutely” relied on Russell Plank’s\npromises in agreeing to and later signing away his lis pendens.          Langston\nconfirmed, “That’s what [Westergren] did in reliance on the representations that\nhad been made to him,” and that Russell Plank shared these same representations\nwith Langston. As a result of Westergren’s signing away his lis pendens, the Plank\nParties “got full control” of the 190 acres. NPH (on its own and through a\npartnership) was able to purchase the 190 acres, received a $6 million distribution\nfrom ML Realty Partners, and resold 20 acres at a higher price for square foot. If\nWestergren successfully had pursued his claim to the 190 acres, he would have\n“the right to go out and buy the 190 acres.” After Westergren released his lis\npendens and dismissed his claim, he requested payment on the agreement. Russell\nPlank told Westergren to come pick up the first half of his $1 million, a “partial\npayment.” Russell Plank did not tell Westergren that he was signing a release\nwhen he received a check for $500,000 but instead told him it was “just a receipt.”\nAt the time of payment, the check was described in NPH’s accounting as for\n“Land-Fixed Asset”; over five months later, this description was changed to\n“Consulting Fees.” When Westergren left with the check, Russell Plank joked\nwith Westergren that he should not spend all the money too quickly just in case\nRussell Plank was not “able to give [Westergren] the other half.” Russell Plank\ntestified that it was he who convinced Michael Plank to pay the $500,000 to\nWestergren: “I talked Mike into paying Gordon a half a million dollars.” Michael\nPlank in “no way” wanted to pay any money to Westergren because Westergren\n                                        31\n\fdid not do “any work” or “anything” to merit being paid. Johnson testified that\nneither of the Planks ever told him that Westergren was a “consultant,” and ML\nRealty Partners’ CEO did not include Westergren on the list of individuals\ninvolved “on the NPH side.”\n\n              a. Whether Russell Plank’s actions are “unequivocally referable” to\n                 his contract with Westergren\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s partial-\nperformance finding, we conclude that Westergren raised a fact issue on whether\nRussell Plank’s actions were unequivocally referable to their oral agreement. The\nfact that the $500,000 check was drawn on NPH’s bank account is not dispositive\nbecause there was clear evidence it was Russell Plank who “pushed” his brother to\n“try to get [Westergren] paid.” See Bookout, 165 S.W.3d at 911 (concluding\nsufficient evidence supported partial performance despite source of check\npayments at issue).27 Russell Plank succeeded in his efforts; Michael Plank finally\nagreed to pay Westergren.\n\n       In addition, that NPH’s accounting notation on the check later was changed\nfrom “Land-Fixed Asset” to “Consulting Fees” does not necessarily mean Russell\nPlank’s conduct in connection with the payment is equally referable to some other\ncontractual arrangement with Westergren. See id. (explaining that jury was free to\nconclude that check payments at issue were evidence of partial performance on\ncontract to purchase chiropractic clinic “notwithstanding the way in which they\nwere marked”). Instead, the evidence indicates NPH did not believe it had any\nagreement to pay anything to Westergren, for consulting or his “time and effort\n       27\n           Duncan v. F-Star Management, L.L.C., relied on by the dissent, is distinguishable.\nThere, neither the sender nor the recipient of the checks at issue was a party to the alleged\ncommission agreements. 281 S.W.3d 474, 482 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2008, pet. denied). Here,\nWestergren was the check recipient and a party to the alleged oral agreement with Russell Plank.\nIn addition, Russell Plank both approved the payment to Westergren and co-signed the check.\n\n                                              32\n\frelated to the [190 acres].” The October 2005 draft profits interest agreement,\npresented to Westergren by Russell Plank, that mentioned Westergren’s providing\nconsulting services for NPH was never signed. Nor did NPH consider Westergren\nits consultant. Russell Plank indicated Michael Plank was “adamant” Westergren\nnot be paid because “[h]e didn’t understand why we had to pay Gordon anything.”\nAnd Michael Plank specifically admitted “we never had a contract with\n[Westergren] for anything.”28\n\n       Nor can we view the $500,000 check in isolation. Westergren testified that\nRussell Plank told him this payment represented only the first half of the “cool\nmillion” and joked that Westergren should not spend it all at once in case Russell\nPlank was unable to “give [him] the other half.” And we already have concluded\nthat Westergren presented more than a scintilla of evidence to support his\nfraudulent-inducement defense to the Release with regard to Russell Plank. Thus,\nwe reject the argument that the $500,000 payment was equally referable to the\nRelease or to any alleged arrangement with NPH.\n\n               b. Whether Westergren’s actions are “unequivocally referable” to\n                  his contract with Russell Plank\n\n       To the extent the Plank Parties also argued that Westergren’s actions were\nnot “unequivocally referable” to his contract with Russell Plank, we also conclude\nWestergren raised a fact issue as to whether his own actions were unequivocally\nreferable to their oral agreement. There is direct testimony from Westergren and\n\n       28\n          Thus, Resendez v. Maloney, relied on by the Plank Parties, is distinguishable. No. 01-\n08-00954-CV, 2010 WL 5395674 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 30, 2010, pet. denied)\n(mem. op.). There, the two companies with which the plaintiff alleged he had a ten-year contract\nadmitted that they worked with the plaintiff on an event-by-event basis; thus, the parties’ actions\nwere “equally referable” to such arrangement. Id. at *8. Likewise, that Michael Plank and NPH\ndisclaimed any contractual arrangement with Westergren and that Westergren never admitted\nperforming any consulting services for the Plank Parties distinguishes the additional cases\ndiscussed by the dissent.\n\n                                                33\n\fLangston that Russell Plank’s representations induced Westergren to sign the\nMSA. While the MSA contained a merger clause, we already have determined that\nno merger occurred as to Russell Plank individually. And the MSA’s reliance\ndisclaimer would not apply to any representations by Russell Plank individually. 29\nThe evidence thus raised a fact issue as to whether Westergren fully performed on\nhis promise to Russell Plank individually by releasing his lis pendens and claim to\nthe 190 acres.\n\n             c. Whether permitting Russell Plank to escape liability would amount\n                to a “virtual fraud”\n\n       We also conclude that Westergren raised a fact issue on whether the failure\nto enforce the oral agreement would result in a “virtual fraud.” Westergren and his\nattorney both testified that Westergren acted in reliance on the contract with\nRussell Plank to his substantial detriment, giving up his right to otherwise purchase\nand develop the 190 acres, a site that had attracted several real estate developers.\nThere is also evidence that Russell Plank would reap an unearned benefit if\npermitted to plead the statute of frauds. Essentially, NPH was able to purchase the\nentire 190 acres—receiving a $6 million distribution from ML Realty Partners, and\nselling a 20-acre parcel for over two and half times its purchase price. As paid\nconsultant for NPH, Russell Plank clearly stood to benefit from this “massive”\nproject.\n\n             d. Here, the jury was free to determine whether the partial-\n                performance exception applied.\n\n      Based on our review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s\nfindings, we conclude more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support that the\nparties’ performance here sufficiently established the partial-performance\n      29\n          “No representations warranties or inducements have been made to any party by any\nother party concerning this Agreement . . . .” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                           34\n\fexception to the statute of frauds. See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830. Therefore, a\nreasonable and fair-minded jury was free to answer “yes” with regard to Russell\nPlank on the partial-performance question. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823,\n827. Thus, this ground does not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s\ngranting JNOV on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n            7. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s damages\n               finding on breach of contract.\n       As discussed supra in Section IV.A.1, the Plank Parties urged in their JNOV\nmotion that because there is no legally sufficient evidence of partial performance,\nall of the jury’s damages findings fail.             The Plank Parties did not argue\nspecifically, until after the trial court entered its judgment, that even if the partial-\nperformance exception applied, Westergren would not be entitled to any damages\nbased on a benefit-of-the-bargain measure.               Therefore, we concluded that\nWestergren did not waive his JNOV complaint by failing to address this particular\nissue on appeal.\n\n       Even assuming the Plank Parties fairly had presented this issue, we conclude\nthat the jury properly could award Westergren damages on his breach-of-contract\nclaim. True, in Exxon, the court concluded in dicta that even if successful in\nremoving the oral agreement at issue from the statute of frauds because of partial\nperformance, the plaintiff only would be entitled to reliance damages. 82 S.W.3d\nat 441. But this conclusion is suspect because the Exxon court simply extended,\nwithout any analysis, the rule that a party may only recover reliance damages in\ncases involving application of the promissory-estoppel exception to the statute of\nfrauds. See id.30 Moreover, Exxon is not on point because there was no evidence\n\n\n       30\n          Wheeler v. White, 398 S.W.2d 93 (Tex. 1966), relied on by the Plank Parties in their\nappellate brief, directly involved a promissory-estoppel claim.\n\n                                             35\n\fof full performance by the party seeking to enforce the agreement.\n\n       Here, not only did Russell Plank partially perform, but also Westergren fully\nperformed. When there is full performance by one party and partial performance\nby the other party, the contract no longer falls under the statute of frauds and may\nbe enforced in law (and not simply as a matter of equity). Thus, Westergren can\nobtain his benefit-of-the-bargain damages. See Davis v. Insurtek, Inc., No. 05-09-\n01029-CV, 2010 WL 5395668, at *4 n.3 (Tex. App.—Dallas Dec. 30, 2010, no\npet.) (mem. op.) (noting fundamental difference between principles of full and part\nperformance, and that full performance by one party takes case out of statute of\nfrauds entirely). When one party fully performs a contract, the statute-of-frauds\ndefense is unavailable to the second party if he knowingly accepts the benefits and\npartially performs. Sheffield v. Gibson, 14-06-00483-CV, 2008 WL 190049, at *2\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Jan. 22, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op); Parks v.\nLandfill Mktg. Consultants, Inc., No. 14-02-01243-CV, 2004 WL 1351545, at *5\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] June 17, 2004, pet. denied) (mem. op.); see also\nMachann v Machann, 269 S.W.2d 826, 828 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1954, writ\nref’d n.r.e.) (“Where a contract is executed on one side and nothing remains but the\npayment of the consideration, this may be recovered notwithstanding the Statute of\nFrauds.”). Because Westergren fully performed, the only thing left was for him to\nbe paid the agreed-upon consideration—in other words, for him to receive the\nremainder of his benefit of the bargain, just as Russell Plank already had.31\n\n       31\n           Many of our treatises on contracts and the statute of frauds note this essential\ndistinction. See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF CONTRACTS § 219 (1932) (full performance has\nthe same effect as if statute of frauds had been satisfied); 37 C.J.S. Statute of Frauds § 190\n(2010) (party who has completely performed can sue under law for benefit of the bargain); 41\nTEX. JUR. 3D Statute of Frauds § 115 (2012) (part performance is ordinarily regarded as a strictly\nequitable doctrine, available in equity courts only, whereas complete performance by one party is\nfrequently regarded as taking the contract out of the statute, even in an action at law); 41 TEX.\nJUR. 3D Statute of Frauds § 117 (2012) (when one party has fully performed and other party\n                                               36\n\f       The jury found damages in favor of Westergren on his breach-of-contract\nclaim against Russell Plank in the amount of $500,000—“[t]he difference, if any,\nbetween the amount Gordon Westergren received from the Defendants and the\namount he would have received if the Defendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon\namount.” We already have concluded there is legally sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could have found that Russell Plank partially and\nWestergren fully performed their respective ends of the agreement.                Russell\nPlank’s partial performance related to paying the first half of the $1 million due\nWestergren, and Westergren testified that he was still owed the other $500,000, as\nwell as a 5% profit interest in the development of the 190 acres. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s damages finding, we thus\nconclude that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support a reasonable and\nfair-minded jury’s award of $500,000 in contract damages.              See Tanner, 289\nS.W.3d at 830; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, even if fairly\npresented, this ground does not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s\ngranting JNOV on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n           8. The evidence does not conclusively establish the Plank Parties’\n              affirmative defenses to Westergren’s contract claim.\n       When a movant for JNOV challenges an adverse finding on an affirmative\ndefense, it must conclusively establish all vital facts in support of that defense.\nMosqueda v. G & H Diversified Mfg., Inc., 223 S.W.3d 571, 576 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (citing Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46\nS.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001)). The Plank Parties argued in their motion for JNOV\nthe trial court should disregard the jury’s finding that Russell Plank’s failure to\ncomply was not excused “because the evidence conclusively established the\n\npartially has performed, the fully performing party is entitled to full consideration under\ncontract).\n\n                                            37\n\faffirmative defenses of waiver, prior material breach, and quasi-estoppel.” On\nappeal, Westergren complains that the Plank Parties did not support this issue with\nany record or case citations, and thus did not meet their burden of proof.\n\n      The jury found that Russell Plank’s failure to comply was not excused by\nwaiver, prior material breach, or quasi-estoppel. With regard to waiver, we already\nhave concluded that the evidence presents at least a fact issue as to whether\nWestergren released any claims against Russell Plank in the MSA and the Release.\nSee supra Section IV.A.3. Thus, even if the Plank Parties had pointed to specific\nevidence in support, it would not conclusively establish all vital facts for this\ndefense. See Dow Chem., 46 S.W.3d at 241–42. With regard to prior material\nbreach, the only arguable bases for any such breach by Westergren would be the\nMSA and the Release, so again the Plank Parties could not have met their burden.\nAnd finally, the only arguable bases for a quasi-estoppel defense also relate to\nWestergren’s position taken in the MSA or the Release. Therefore, because the\nPlank Parties have the burden of proof on their affirmative defenses, and because\nthey failed to prove they were entitled to them as a matter of law, we conclude that\nwe cannot sustain JNOV on this ground. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n          9. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the existence of an\n             agreement between Westergren and Russell Plank, that Russell\n             Plank failed to comply with that agreement, and that Westergren\n             suffered damages of $500,000 as a result.\n      We already have addressed most aspects of this ground elsewhere. In sum,\nWestergren and Langston both testified regarding Russell Plank’s promise to pay\nWestergren $1 million and a profit interest (ultimately set at 5%) in the\ndevelopment of the 190 acres. There is no dispute that Westergren only received a\ncheck in the amount of $500,000, and Russell Plank did not pay Westergren\nanything beyond the $500,000. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most\n\n                                         38\n\ffavorable to the jury’s findings, and indulging every reasonable inference to\nsupport them, we conclude that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support\nthe findings that an agreement existed, that Russell Plank breached it, and that\nWestergren suffered damages of $500,000. See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830; City\nof Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Having concluded that we cannot uphold the\ntrial court’s judgment on any of the grounds asserted in the Plank Parties’ motion\nfor JNOV with regard to breach of contract, we conclude that Westergren has met\nhis burden to show error and we sustain his first issue. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at\n394.   Thus, we reverse the trial court’s judgment as it pertains to—and we\nreinstate—the jury’s findings related to Westergren’s breach-of-contract claim on\nquestions 1, 2, 4, and 5, and partially reinstate the jury’s findings on questions 3\nand 14 only with regard to Russell Plank.\n\n             10.We must remand for a new trial on Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\n       Having concluded that Westergren is entitled to reversal and reinstatement\nof the jury’s findings related to his contract claim, we consider whether we also\ncan reinstate the jury’s award of $200,000 for attorney’s fees for trial, and\ncontingent fees of $25,000 for this appeal and $20,000 for a petition of review to\nthe Texas Supreme Court.32 The Plank Parties in their motion for JNOV argued\nthat the jury’s attorney’s fee award was improper because no evidence supported\nthe specific amount awarded and because Westergren’s counsel admitted that he\ndid not segregate fees among contract and tort claims. On appeal, Westergren\ncontends that the amount awarded is within the range supported by the evidence\nand that segregation is not required where services are rendered in connection with\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that prosecuting\nand defending them entail the same facts. Setting aside the propriety of the\n\n       32\n            See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 (West 2011).\n\n                                              39\n\fspecific amount awarded, we conclude Westergren has not met his burden to\ndemonstrate that fee segregation is not required.\n\n      Generally, a party seeking attorney’s fees must segregate fees incurred in\nconnection with a claim that allows their recovery from fees incurred in connection\nwith claims for which no such recovery is allowed. CA Partners v. Spears, 274\nS.W.3d 51, 81 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). Texas courts\nrecognize an exception to this general rule. Id. (citing Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006)). When discrete legal services advance\nboth recoverable and unrecoverable claims, attorneys are not required to segregate\nfees to recover the total amount covering all claims. Id. (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d\nat 313). In this situation, the claims are said to be “intertwined,” and the mere fact\nthat attorney’s fees are incurred in advancing both recoverable and unrecoverable\nclaims does not render those fees unrecoverable. Id. (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n313–14). But if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which fees are\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Id.\nat 82 (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313). “[T]he evidence of the amount of\nrecoverable attorney’s fees is sufficiently segregated if, for example, the attorney\ntestifies that a given percentage of the drafting time would have been necessary\neven if the claim for which attorney’s fees are not recoverable had not been\nasserted.” Id. (citation omitted). The party seeking to recover attorney’s fees\ncarries the burden of demonstrating that fee segregation is not required. Id.\n\n      The only testimony provided by Westergren’s attorney was that he had not\nsegregated any fees among claims for which fees are recoverable versus\nunrecoverable because he did not think it was “necessary.”          Notwithstanding\nWestergren’s argument that the facts are interrelated, the Texas Supreme Court\nexpressly has held “[i]ntertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable.” Id. at\n\n                                         40\n\f83 (quoting Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313). Instead, the focus is whether the legal\nwork performed pertains solely to claims for which attorney’s fees are\nunrecoverable. Id. (citing 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A Car Sys.,\nInc., 245 S.W.3d 488, 509 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied)).\nThis does not mean examining the work product as a whole, but rather parsing it\ninto component tasks. Id. (citing 7979 Airport Garage, 245 S.W.3d at 509).\n\n      While Westergren’s contract and tort claims may have involved developing\nsome of the same facts and presenting some of the same evidence, Westergren has\nfailed to present evidence that his partnership and fraud claims did not require any\nsolely separate drafting, legal research, or discovery. See id. at 84. Therefore,\nWestergren has failed to demonstrate that segregation of fees is not required.\nHowever, Westergren did not forfeit his right to recover attorney’s fees by failing\nto segregate them, and “[t]he evidence he presented regarding the total amount of\nattorney’s fees he incurred is some evidence of what the segregated amount should\nbe.” See id. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the trial court’s judgment\ndisregarding the jury’s finding on Westergren’s attorney’s fees, and remand for a\nnew trial on attorney’s fees. See id. at 81, 84 (citing A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v.\nBeyer, 235 S.W.3d 704, 710 (Tex. 2007)).\n\n      B. Whether the trial court erred in disregarding the jury’s partnership\n         and fraud findings\n      In issues two and three, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in\ndisregarding the jury’s findings in his favor on his partnership and affirmative\nfraud claims. With regard to Westergren’s partnership claims, the jury awarded\nhim $177,608, or “[t]he difference, if any, between the amount Gordon Westergren\nreceived from the Defendants and the amount he would have received if the\nDefendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon amount.” With regard to Westergren’s\n\n\n                                        41\n\ffraud-by-misrepresentation and statutory fraud claims, the jury awarded him zero\ndollars, or “[t]he difference, if any, between the amount Gordon Westergren\nreceived from the Defendants and the amount he would have received if the\nDefendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon amount.” In the contract damages\nquestion, the jury awarded Westergren $500,000 as “[t]he difference, if any,\nbetween the amount Gordon Westergren received from the Defendants and the\namount he would have received if the Defendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon\namount.” Thus, for each of his theories of liability, Westergren alleged, and the\njury was asked the same measure of damages for, a single financial injury—the\nremaining benefit of the bargain due to him.\n\n      Under the one-satisfaction rule, a claimant is entitled to only one recovery\nfor any damages suffered. Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 390\n(Tex. 2000) (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex.\n1991)). The rule applies when different parties commit the same act or when\ndifferent acts cause the same injury. Id. “‘There can be but one recovery for one\ninjury, and the fact that . . . there may be more than one theory of liability[ ] does\nnot modify this rule.’” Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 303 (quoting Stewart Title Guar.\nCo., 822 S.W.2d at 8)). When a party tries a case on alternative theories of\nrecovery and a jury returns favorable findings on two or more theories, we should\nrender judgment on the finding affording the greatest recovery.         Birchfield v.\nTexarkana Mem’l Hosp., 747 S.W.2d 361, 367 (Tex. 1987); Murphy v. Seabarge,\nLtd., 868 S.W.2d 929, 938 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied).\nThis rule applies in the context of submission of overlapping contract and tort\nclaims. Cottman Transmission Sys., L.L.C. v. FVLR Enters., L.L.C., 295 S.W.3d\n372, 379 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      In this case, the jury was asked the same measure of damages on each of\n\n                                         42\n\fWestergren’s theories of liability and awarded him the greatest recovery for his\ncontract cause of action.33 Because we reverse and reinstate the jury’s findings\nregarding the contract claim, we need not address Westergren’s issues regarding\nthe tort claims. See id. (applying one-satisfaction rule where plaintiff was awarded\nactual damages on contract claim, and same damages for fraud, negligent-\nmisrepresentation, and promissory-estoppel claims).\n\n       C. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Westergren\n          leave to amend his petition\n       In his fourth issue, Westergren asserts that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in denying him leave to amend his petition during trial to plead lack of\nconsideration as an affirmative defense to the MSA. Because we already have\nsustained Westergren’s first issue to reinstate the jury’s findings in his favor\nregarding his contract claim, we need not address this issue to finally dispose of\nthis appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n       D. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in its award of costs\n\n       Both Westergren and the Plank Parties requested court costs in the trial\ncourt. In its final judgment, the trial court awarded court costs to the Plank Parties.\n\n       Rule 131 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides “[t]he successful\nparty to a suit shall recover of his adversary all costs incurred therein, except\nwhere otherwise provided.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 131 (emphasis added). A “successful\nparty” under the rules is one that obtains a judgment vindicating a civil right.\nPerez v. Baker Packers, 694 S.W.2d 138, 143 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n       33\n          The trial court refused Westergren’s request to award profits disgorgement. However,\nwhether in equity to award, and the amount of any, profits disgorgement is within the trial\ncourt’s discretion. See Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229, 237 (Tex. 1999). Thus, Westergren\ndoes not argue that the trial court was required to order disgorgement.\n\n\n                                             43\n\f1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.). We review a trial court’s allocation of costs for abuse of\ndiscretion. Univ. of Houston–Clear Lake v. Marsh, 981 S.W.2d 912, 914 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.).\n\n      Because the trial court’s award of court costs to the Plank Parties was likely\npredicated on its erroneous granting of JNOV in their favor, and in view of our\nrulings,34 because the only proper successful party is Westergren, we conclude that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in its allocation of costs. Thus, we reverse the\nportion of the trial court’s judgment awarding the Plank Parties their court costs\nand remand to the trial court to impose costs consistent with this opinion. 35 See\nJordan v. Bustamante, 158 S.W.3d 29, 43-44 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2005, pet. denied) (reversing and remanding to trial court for reallocation of costs\nwhere party was successful on appeal).\n\n      E. Whether the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the\n         jury’s failure to find that Westergren breached the MSA or the\n         Release\n      In the two issues presented in their cross-appeal, the Plank Parties assert that\nthe evidence is legally insufficient or, in the alternative, factually insufficient to\nsupport the jury’s failure to find that Westergren breached the MSA or the Release.\nThe Plank Parties argue the evidence conclusively establishes that Westergren\nbreached each of these contracts by filing this lawsuit against the Plank Parties,\nresulting in $729,487.54 in damages ($704,961.10 in reasonable attorney’s fees\nand $24,526.44 in costs and expenses incurred by the Plank Parties in defending\nthis lawsuit). For the purposes of our analysis, we presume, without deciding, that\nat least one claim asserted by Westergren in this lawsuit is within the scope of the\nMSA and the Release. Notwithstanding our conclusion that the evidence is legally\n      34\n           See supra Section IV.A and infra Section IV.E.\n      35\n           Westergren submitted to the trial court a bill of costs in the amount of $12,284.78.\n\n                                                 44\n\fsufficient to support the jury’s finding that Russell Plank’s failure to comply with\nthe oral agreement was not excused, and the jury’s finding that Russell Plank\ncommitted fraud by omission to support Westergren’s fraudulent-inducement\ndefense to the Release, we also presume, solely for purposes of our analysis, that\nthe MSA and the Release are each binding and enforceable against Westergren.\n\n      The analysis of these cross-issues requires us to interpret the MSA and the\nRelease to determine if either contract imposes an obligation on Westergren not to\nfile suit on any of the claims released by Westergren. Both the MSA and the\nRelease contain release provisions. Releases are subject to the usual rules of\ncontract construction. Baty v. ProTech Ins. Agency, 63 S.W.3d 841, 848 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (op. on reh’g).          In construing\ncontracts, our primary concern is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of\nthe parties as expressed in the contract. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh,\nPa. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 955 S.W.2d 120, 127 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n1997), aff’d sub nom., Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of\nPittsburgh, Pa., 20 S.W.3d 692 (Tex. 2000).         To ascertain the parties’ true\nintentions, we examine the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give\neffect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.\nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Tex. Utils. Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 652 (Tex. 1999).\nWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. Heritage Res.,\nInc. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996). When a written contract is\nworded so that it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation,\nit is unambiguous, and the court construes it as a matter of law. Nat’l Union Fire\nIns. Co., 955 S.W.2d at 128. We cannot rewrite the contract or add to its language\nunder the guise of interpretation. See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124\nS.W.3d 154, 162 (Tex. 2003).\n\n\n                                         45\n\f      Under the MSA, Westergren agrees to “release” and “discharge” the claims\nin question and to release any notice of lis pendens that he has filed against the 190\nacres. Under the Release, Westergren “does hereby fully and unconditionally\nrelease and forever relinquish” various rights, titles, and interests, and Westergren\nalso “does hereby fully and unconditionally remise, release and forever discharge”\nvarious claims.     Neither of these contracts contains any language in which\nWestergren indemnifies, holds harmless, protects, or defends any of the Plank\nParties. These contracts do not contain any language in which the parties agree\nthat any of the released parties may recover their attorney’s fees and defense costs\nagainst Westergren if he files suit based upon any of the released claims. Nor do\nthese contracts contain any language in which Westergren expressly agrees,\npromises, or covenants that he will not file suit based upon any of the released\nclaims. See Watson v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 14-03-01202-CV, 2005 WL\n1869064, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 9, 2005, no pet.) (mem.\nop.) (concluding that “nothing in the contract represents a clear, express waiver of\n[plaintiff’s] right to sue [defendant] for alleged violations of the law”).\n\n      The Plank Parties do not assert that either contract contains such language.\nInstead, the Plank Parties argue that a release constitutes a promise not to bring a\nlawsuit based upon the released claims. The Plank Parties essentially argue that,\nby agreeing to release and discharge certain claims, a party necessarily and\nimplicitly agrees that he will not file suit based upon any of the released claims.\nUnder this proffered construction, the plain meaning of the release language in the\nMSA and the Release would include a promise not to file suit based upon any of\nthe released claims. We conclude that this construction is not a valid one.\n\n      A release of claims operates to discharge the released parties from these\nclaims and to extinguish these claims against the released parties as effectively as\n\n                                           46\n\fwould a prior judgment between the parties. See El Paso Natural Gas Co. v.\nMinco Oil & Gas, Inc., 8 S.W.3d 309, 314 n.15 (Tex. 1999); Dresser Indus. v.\nPage Petroleum, 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex. 1993); Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp.,\n76 S.W.3d 555, 565 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). Therefore, a\nrelease of a claim is an absolute bar to any right of action by the releasing party on\nthe claim, and a release is an affirmative defense in a lawsuit in which the releasing\nparty asserts a released claim. See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann,\n76 S.W.3d at 565. On the other hand, an indemnity is a promise to safeguard or\nhold harmless the indemnitee against either existing or future liability. See Dresser\nIndus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565. Unlike a release, which\ndischarges a released claim, an indemnity creates a potential cause of action in the\nindemnitee against the indemnitor.             See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508;\nLehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565.\n\n       Thus, the release language contained in the MSA and the Release provides\nthe released parties with an affirmative defense that bars any claims by the\nreleasing parties on these claims, but this language does not give the released\nparties a breach-of-contract claim for damages resulting from a releasing party’s\nsuit against the released parties on these claims. See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at\n508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565.36 The released parties only would have such a\nclaim if the contract in question also contained language in which the releasing\nparties agreed not to file suit based upon any of the released claims. See, e.g.,\nCoterill-Jenkins v. Tex. Med. Ass’n Health Care Liab. Claim Trust, 383 S.W.3d\n       36\n           See also McMahan v. Toto, 256 F.3d 1120, 1124–25 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting\nprior holding of New York intermediate court of appeals that release language in contract did not\nconstitute a promise by the releasing party not to file suit based upon any of the released claims);\nMcMahan & Co. v. Bass, 673 N.Y.S.2d 19, 20–21 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998) (concluding release\nlanguage in contract did not constitute a promise by the releasing party not to file suit based upon\nany of the released claims and that such a promise would not exist absent express language in\ncontract establishing such a promise).\n\n                                                47\n\f581, 590 n.5 (Tex.

(involving settlement agreement in which releasing parties also\npromised not to file suit against released parties based upon any released claim).\nBut, as noted, neither the MSA nor the Release contains such language.\n\n      The Plank Parties rely upon Ganske v. WRS Group, Inc. See No. 10-06-\n00050-CV, 2007 WL 1147357, at *2–4 (Tex. App.—Waco Apr. 18, 2007, no pet.)\n(mem. op.). Though the Ganske court reversed a summary judgment dismissing a\nclaim for breach of a settlement agreement against a releasing party who filed suit\non released claims, the court did not analyze or discuss the language of the\nsettlement agreement giving rise to the releasing party’s obligation not to file suit\non these claims. See id. Ganske thus does not support the proposition that release\nlanguage in a settlement agreement includes a promise not to file suit based upon\nany of the released claims. See id.\n\n      The Plank Parties also rely upon P&S Corp. v. Park. See No. 14-05-00115-\nCV, 2006 WL 1168804, at *7 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 4, 2006, no\npet.) (mem. op.). In this case, we did not address whether any release language in\na settlement agreement includes a promise not to file suit based upon any of the\nreleased claims. See id. In addition, the settlement agreement in that case did not\ncontain release language, but instead contained an express promise not to sue. See\nid. at *3. P&S Corp. is thus not on point.\n\n      We conclude that, as to the issue of whether Westergren promised not to file\nsuit based upon any of the released claims, the MSA and Release are unambiguous.\nUnder the plain meaning of these contracts, Westergren released certain claims but\n\n                                         48\n\fdid not promise to refrain from filing suit based upon any of the released claims.\nSee Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565. Considering\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged findings, indulging every\nreasonable inference that would support them, crediting favorable evidence if\nreasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable\njurors could not, the evidence would enable a reasonable and fair-minded jury to\nconclude that Westergren did not breach the MSA or the Release. See City of\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827; Yeh v. David J. MacDougall, D.O., P.A., No. 01-\n06-00509-CV, 2008 WL 183712, at *3–4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Jan. 17,\n2008, no pet.) (mem. op.) (concluding evidence was legally sufficient to support\njury’s failure to find contract breach). Therefore, the evidence is legally sufficient\nto support the jury’s failure to find that Westergren breached either contract.\n\n      In addition, the evidence is factually sufficient. Examining the entire record,\nconsidering both the evidence in favor of, and contrary to, the challenged finding,\nand considering and weighing all the evidence, we conclude the jury’s finding that\nWestergren did not breach the MSA or the Release was not so contrary to the\noverwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.\nSee Jackson, 116 S.W.3d at 761; Yeh, 2008 WL 183712, at *5 (concluding\nevidence was factually sufficient to support jury’s failure to find contract breach).\nAccordingly, we overrule the Plank Parties’ first and second cross-issues.\n\n      In a conditional cross-issue, the Plank Parties assert that if this court reverses\nthe JNOV and enters judgment for Westergren, any recovery must be limited to\n$200,000 pursuant to the “Agreement to Limit Third-Party Defendants Indemnity\nExposure,” entered into by Westergren and various other parties (the “Frontier\nParties”). However, the Plank Parties concede that this cap only applies if the\nFrontier Parties are required to indemnify the Plank Parties for Westergren’s\n\n                                          49\n\fclaims in this case pursuant to a settlement agreement and release, entered into\nbetween the Plank Parties and the Frontier Parties. In a separate appeal, this court\nhas concluded that, as a matter of law, Westergren’s claims do not fall within the\nscope of the settlement agreement and release. Frontier Logistics, L.P. v. Nat’l\nProp. Holdings, L.P., —S.W.3d—, No. 14-11-00357-CV, 2013 WL 1683603, at\n*6 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 18, 2013, no pet. h.). Thus, we also\noverrule the Plank Parties’ conditional cross-issue.\n\n                                V.     CONCLUSION\n\n      As to the Plank Parties’ motion to disregard jury findings regarding the\nbreach-of-contract claim, Westergren has shown that each independent ground of\nthe motion fails to provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment. Thus,\nwe reverse the trial court’s judgment with regard to, and reinstate in their entirety,\nthe jury’s findings on questions 1, 2, 4, and 5, and partially reinstate the jury’s\nfindings on questions 3 and 14 only with regard to Russell Plank. As a result, we\nalso reverse the trial court’s judgment disregarding the jury’s finding on question\n26 as to Westergren’s attorney’s fees; however, because we conclude that\nWestergren failed to demonstrate that segregation of his awarded attorney’s fees\nwas not required, we remand for a new trial on Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\nBecause Westergren is the only successful party, we also reverse the trial court’s\njudgment with regard to its allocation of court costs and remand for reallocation.\nFinally, because Westergren achieved the greatest recovery for his contract claim,\nwe otherwise affirm the trial court’s judgment with regard to Westergren’s\npartnership and fraud claims.\n\n      Under the plain meaning of the language in the MSA and the Release,\nWestergren did not promise to refrain from filing suit based on any of the allegedly\nreleased claims. Therefore, the record evidence is legally and factually sufficient\n\n                                         50\n\fto support the jury’s findings that Westergren did not breach any contract, and we\naffirm that portion of the trial court’s judgment that the Plank Parties take nothing\non their counterclaims. Accordingly, the trial court’s judgment is affirmed in part\nand reversed in part, and we remand for limited proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                       /s/    Tracy Christopher\n                                              Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Frost, Christopher, and McCally.

Defendants National Property Holdings,\nL.P., Michael Plank, and Russell Plank (collectively, the “Plank Parties”)\ncounterclaimed, alleging breach of contract with regard to a settlement agreement\n\fand a release. The jury rendered findings favorable to Westergren and adverse to\nthe Plank Parties. The trial court rendered judgment that the parties take nothing\non their respective claims. On appeal, Westergren asserts that the trial court erred\nin rendering judgment he take nothing, in denying him leave to amend his petition\nduring trial, and in awarding court costs to the Plank Parties. On cross-appeal, the\nPlank Parties argue that the trial court erred in rendering judgment they take\nnothing. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for limited proceedings.\n\n              I.      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Appellant Gordon Westergren, a lifelong resident of LaPorte, Texas, wanted\nto purchase and develop certain real property in LaPorte, specifically, 190 acres on\nthe east side of Powell Road. These 190 acres are situated along a rail line\nbetween two shipping terminals.      Westergren entered into a purchase option\ncontract with the owners of the 190 acres. The owners later entered into two\nadditional purchase option contracts on the same 190 acres.          In July 2004,\nWestergren filed suit (“the 190-acres litigation”) against the owners and the two\nother parties who claimed an option to purchase the 190 acres, asserting that he\npossessed the superior right to purchase. Westergren also filed a lis pendens on the\nproperty, which effectively prevented the sale and development of the 190 acres.\n\n      While the 190-acres litigation was pending, Westergren met the Planks.\nSpecifically, Walter Johnson, then CEO of Amegy Bank, had participated in\nseveral “handshake” transactions with Westergren in which Johnson served as the\nfinancial partner while Westergren “found and sourced” property deals in the\nLaPorte area. Although Johnson was not interested in purchasing and developing\nthe 190 acres, Johnson introduced Westergren to two brothers, Michael Plank and\nRussell Plank, who were clients of the bank. Michael Plank is the President of the\ncorporate general partner of National Property Holdings, L.P. (“NPH”), a Texas\n\n                                         2\n\flimited partnership involved in real estate development. Russell Plank performs\nconsulting services for various companies, including NPH. Several developers,\nincluding NPH, were interested in purchasing and developing the 190 acres.\n\n       In January 2005, after Westergren met the Planks, Russell Plank contacted\nRobert Langston, the attorney representing Westergren in the 190-acres litigation.\nRussell Plank called Langston about paying Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\nLangston asked Russell Plank why he would do that for Westergren; Russell Plank\nresponded “[b]ecause we’re going to be partners.” Langston then received a $5000\ncheck from NPH1 and a $5000 check “personally” from Russell Plank.2\n\n       Although the Plank Parties were not parties to the 190-acres litigation,\nRussell Plank, sent by Michael Plank on behalf of NPH, attended a mediation\ninvolving the litigation parties in August 2005. Westergren and Langston attended\nthe mediation. At this mediation, NPH agreed to pay out cash settlements to all the\nlitigants, except Westergren, for their claims on the 190 acres. At the mediation,\naccording to Westergren and Langston, Russell Plank promised that, in exchange\nfor Westergren’s release of his lis pendens and the settlement of the 190-acres\nlitigation, Westergren would become a partner of the Plank Parties and would\nreceive $1 million cash and an interest in profits (the exact percentage to be\nnegotiated) from the purchase and development of the 190 acres. Westergren\ntestified that at the mediation Russell Plank said, “Don’t worry about it, Gordon.\nLet’s get these guys out of the way, and we’ll get it handled.”\n\n       Langston repeatedly requested of both Russell Plank and Westergren that the\nparties reduce their partnership deal to writing. In October 2005, Russell Plank\n\n       1\n         This check was co-signed by Russell Plank, and the check’s reference was to “LaPorte\nProperty.”\n       2\n           This check’s memo was for “Legal Fees—GW.”\n\n                                             3\n\fpresented Westergren with a profits interest agreement drafted by appellees’\nattorneys. This draft agreement stated that Westergren was to provide consulting\nservices in exchange for a 5% profit interest in funds distributed by NPH. Russell\nPlank then crossed out the 5% term and hand-wrote 10%, then 20%.                         This\nagreement was not signed.\n\n         In January 2006, NPH and the parties to the 190-acres litigation entered into\na Mediation Settlement Agreement (“MSA”). NPH was a signatory party to the\nMSA. Neither Michael Plank nor Russell Plank individually was a signatory to the\nMSA. In the MSA, NPH agreed to purchase the 190 acres in dispute; Westergren\nand the other parties to the litigation agreed to release any lis pendens, and to\nrelease and dismiss all claims regarding the 190 acres.\n\n         According to Westergren, at the time that he agreed to sign the MSA, he did\nso in reliance upon the oral partnership deal with NPH, Michael Plank, and Russell\nPlank:\n\n         [The Plank Parties] were going to pay me a cool million bucks for\n         signing off, letting them have control of the property, and give me a 5\n         percent interest in the 190 acres. That’s what caused me to give them\n         control of the property.\nWestergren further testified that the “final” deal at the time he agreed to “sign\naway” his lis pendens was “a million in cash and a 5 percent[]—a 5 percent profits\nparticipation.”3 According to Westergren, under this 5% profits participation, the\nPlank Parties would pay Westergren 5% of the profits, if any, that they realized\nupon selling or “flipping” the 190 acres to a third party.\n\n\n         3\n         According to Westergren, at some point after Russell Plank presented Westergren with\nthe profits interest agreement where Russell Plank hand-wrote in the 20% profit interest term,\nRussell Plank presented to Westergren another draft agreement that included the terms of the\n“cool million bucks and a 5 percent participation.”\n\n                                              4\n\f       After the mediation, because 190 acres was more land than the Plank Parties\nwere comfortable purchasing and developing, the Plank Parties held meetings with\nvarious companies to serve as potential partners, including ML Realty Partners, a\nChicago-based investment and development company interested in long-term real\nestate holdings. In January 2006, NPH entered into a contribution agreement with\nML Realty Partners. Under this agreement, upon NPH’s acquisition of the entire\n190 acres, ML Realty Partners would distribute $6 million to NPH.\n\n       On February 14, 2006, Westergren released his lis pendens and dismissed\nhis claim in the 190-acres litigation with prejudice.              Two days later, NPH\npurchased 20 of the 190 acres, and Port Crossing Land, L.P., a limited partnership\nin which the limited partners were an NPH-affiliated entity4 and ML Realty\nPartners, purchased the remaining 170 acres. The purchase price of the 190 acres\nwas approximately $.75 per square foot. ML Realty Partners distributed $6 million\nto NPH. In June 2006, NPH sold the 20-acre parcel to Del Piso Investments, an\nArizona limited partnership, for $1.742 million, or a purchase price of\napproximately $2 per square foot.5\n\n       At this time, Westergren still had not received any payment from the Plank\nParties, and started calling them. According to Westergren, Russell Plank finally\ntold him, “Look, we can’t give you the whole million right now but we’re going to\ngive you a half a million bucks.” Both Michael Plank and Russell Plank testified\nthat they agreed to pay Westergren $500,000. Westergren met with Russell Plank\nat the NPH office on June 30, 2006, at which time Russell Plank gave Westergren\na check for $500,000.6 Without reading it, Westergren also signed a two-page\n\n       4\n           This entity was NPH LaPorte Realty, L.P.\n       5\n         In December 2005, Arizona Tile, L.L.C. had entered into an earnest money contract for\nthe purchase of this 20 acres from NPH.\n       6\n           This $500,000 NPH check was co-signed by Russell Plank. In NPH’s accounting\n                                                5\n\fdocument entitled “Agreement and Release” (“Release”), which was notarized in\nWestergren’s presence. The Release was drafted by the Plank Parties’ attorneys,\nand the Plank Parties did not send the Release to or discuss it with Langston. The\nRelease stated that in exchange for “receipt” of the $500,000, Westergren released\nand relinquished any rights and interests in the 190 acres, and released all claims\nregarding the 190 acres against Michael Plank, NPH, and their agents. Westergren\ntestified that he did not read the document because he did not have his reading\nglasses7 with him and was “in a hurry.” Westergren admitted he was wearing a\nwatch with a built-in magnifying glass that he sometimes used to help him read.\nAccording to Westergren, after he asked what the document was, Russell Plank\ndescribed it as “just a receipt” and “nothing,” and told Westergren “you don’t have\nto worry about it.” Russell Plank did not tell Westergren that the document was a\nrelease. Westergren testified he relied on Russell Plank’s “representation” that the\ndocument was “just a receipt” in signing the Release.\n\n      In February 2007, Westergren sent a letter to Michael Plank to request the\nother $500,000 and his “5% interest.” Westergren and Michael Plank then met for\nlunch. Westergren testified that, during lunch, he found out about the Release and\nMichael Plank told Westergren “you need to read what you sign.” The Plank\nParties refused to pay Westergren any additional compensation. Westergren filed\nsuit against the Plank Parties, asserting various claims, including breach of\ncontract, breach of partnership duties, common-law fraud, and statutory fraud. The\nPlank Parties filed a counterclaim asserting that Westergren breached the MSA and\nthe Release by filing suit.\n\nrecords, this payment was approved by “R.D.P.” and initially described as for “Land-Fixed\nAsset.” Several months later, the description was changed to “Consulting Fees.”\n      7\n       Westergren had undergone ocular lens replacement due to leukemia and could not read\ndocuments without eyeglasses.\n\n                                            6\n\f       After a trial, the jury found the following:\n\n               Russell Plank agreed to pay Westergren $1 million and a 5% profit\n               interest in the development of the 190 acres in exchange for\n               Westergren’s releasing his lis pendens and giving up his contractual\n               right to the 190 acres.8\n               Russell Plank failed to comply with this agreement.\n               NPH, Michael Plank, and Russell Plank each partially performed the\n               agreement to pay Westergren $1 million and a 5% profit interest in the\n               development of the 190 acres.\n               Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his agreement was not\n               excused.9\n               The sum of $500,000, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably\n               would compensate Westergren for his damages that resulted from\n               Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his agreement, based upon the\n               difference between the amount Westergren received from the Plank\n               Parties and the amount Westergren would have received if the Plank\n               Parties had paid him the agreed-upon amount.\n               Each of the Plank Parties formed a partnership with Westergren.\n               Each of the Plank Parties failed to comply with its respective duty of\n               loyalty to Westergren and with its respective duty of care to\n               Westergren.10\n               These failures were not excused by Westergren’s later taking an\n               inconsistent position to the disadvantage of the Plank Parties.\n               The sum of $177,608, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably\n\n       8\n          The trial court granted partial directed verdict in favor of the Plank Parties, ruling that\nany allegation of fraud against NPH prior to the execution of the MSA was barred by the MSA’s\ndisclaimer of reliance. Westergren does not appeal this ruling. As a result of this ruling, the\nparties agreed that NPH would not be submitted as part of the breach-of-contract claim. The jury\ndid not find that Michael Plank individually entered into the oral agreement, and Westergren\ndoes not appeal this finding.\n       9\n         The jury was instructed on the Plank Parties’ affirmative defenses of prior material\nbreach, waiver, and quasi-estoppel.\n       10\n          The jury found that NPH was 50% responsible, Michael Plank was 25% responsible,\nand Russell Plank was 25% responsible for causing Westergren harm due to breach of\npartnership duties.\n\n                                                 7\n\f              would compensate Westergren for his damages that were proximately\n              caused by those breaches of partnership duties, based upon the\n              difference between the amount Westergren received from the Plank\n              Parties and the amount Westergren would have received if the Plank\n              Parties had paid him the agreed-upon amount.\n              NPH’s profit in the acquisition of the 190 acres was $3,552,174.\n              Each of the Plank Parties committed common-law fraud by\n              misrepresentation, common-law fraud by omission, and statutory\n              fraud against Westergren.11\n              The fraud by misrepresentation and statutory fraud were not excused\n              by Westergren’s later taking an inconsistent position to the\n              disadvantage of the Plank Parties.\n              Zero dollars, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably would\n              compensate Westergren for his damages, if any, that resulted from\n              such fraud, based upon the difference between the amount Westergren\n              received from the Plank Parties and the amount Westergren would\n              have received if the Plank Parties had paid him the agreed-upon\n              amount.\n              The amount of $200,000 would be a reasonable fee for the necessary\n              services of Westergren’s attorney for preparation and trial; $25,000,\n              for an appeal to the court of appeals; and $20,000, for a petition for\n              review to the Texas Supreme Court.\n              Westergren did not fail to comply with the MSA or the Release.\n\n       The Plank Parties filed a motion to disregard all the jury findings adverse to\nthem and requested a take-nothing judgment as to all of Westergren’s claims and\njudgment in favor of the Plank Parties on their counterclaims. 12 Westergren filed a\nmotion for judgment on the jury’s verdict and a motion for disgorgement of profits.\nThe trial court denied the Plank Parties’ their motion as to their counterclaims but\n\n       11\n         The jury found that NPH was 30% responsible, Michael Plank was 20% responsible,\nand Russell Plank was 50% responsible for causing Westergren harm due to common-law fraud\nby misrepresentation and statutory fraud.\n       12\n          This filing was styled as a motion to disregard the jury’s findings and for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict.\n\n                                              8\n\fgranted it as to Westergren’s claims against the Plank Parties. The trial court\ndenied Westergren’s motion for disgorgement of profits, granted Westergren’s\nmotion for judgment as to the Plank Parties’ counterclaims, and denied\nWestergren’s motion for judgment as to Westergren’s claims against the Plank\nParties. The trial court rendered judgment that Westergren take nothing on his\nclaims and that the Plank Parties take nothing on their claims, and charged\nWestergren with paying the Plank Parties’ costs of court.\n\n                           II.      ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      On appeal, Westergren presents five issues. First, Westergren argues that\nthe trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on\nhis breach-of-contract claim. Second, Westergren contends that the trial court\nerred in granting JNOV on his partnership claims. Third, Westergren argues that\nthe trial court similarly erred with regard to his fraud claims. Fourth, Westergren\ncomplains about the trial court’s denial of his request to amend his petition to add a\nnew defense. Finally, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in awarding\ncourt costs to the Plank Parties.\n\n      On cross-appeal, the Plank Parties present two issues.         First, the Plank\nParties argue that they conclusively proved (a) that Westergren breached the MSA\nand the Release by filing the underlying suit and (b) the amount of their resulting\ndamages, such that the trial court should have rendered judgment in their favor on\ntheir counterclaims. Second, the Plank Parties contend the jury’s finding that\nWestergren did not breach the MSA and the Release was against the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence such that the trial court should have granted the\nPlank Parties a new trial on their counterclaims. In a conditional cross-issue, the\nPlank Parties also assert that any recovery by Westergren must be capped at\n$200,000.\n\n                                          9\n\f                       III.

ANALYSIS\n\n      A. Whether the trial court erred in disregarding the jury’s breach-of-\n         contract findings\n      In his first issue, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in rendering\nJNOV as to Westergren’s breach-of-contract claim. In their motion, the Plank\nParties asked the trial court to disregard the jury’s findings regarding the breach-\nof-contract claim based upon the following grounds: (1) Russell Plank cannot be\nheld liable for breach of contract as a matter of law because the evidence\nconclusively proves he was acting as an agent of NPH and did not assume any\npersonal liability; (2) any breach-of-contract claim was released under the MSA\nand the Release; (3) the alleged contract is unenforceable for lack of consideration;\n(4) any agreement reached before the MSA merged into and was superseded by the\nMSA; (5) the alleged contract is unenforceable because it is subject to the statute\nof frauds and the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s finding of the\npartial-performance exception to the statute of frauds; (6) because there is no\nlegally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s partial-performance finding and\nbecause the jury’s damages findings are based upon a benefit-of-the-bargain\nmeasure of damages, all of the damages findings fail under the statute of frauds;\n(7) the evidence conclusively establishes the affirmative defenses of waiver, prior\nmaterial breach, and quasi-estoppel; and (8) the evidence is legally insufficient to\nsupport the jury’s findings that Russell Plank entered into the alleged oral\nagreement with Westergren, that Russell Plank failed to comply with this\nagreement, and as to Westergren’s damages resulting from that failure to comply.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      The trial court granted the Plank Parties’ motion to disregard the jury\nfindings regarding the breach-of-contract claim without specifying the grounds\nupon which it relied. Therefore, on appeal, Westergren must show that each\nindependent ground fairly asserted against the breach-of-contract claim does not\nprovide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment as to this claim. See Fort\nBend Cty. Drainage Dist. v. Sbrusch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443184\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443184/fort-bend-county-drainage-dist-v-sbrusch/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (Tex. 1991).\n\n           1. Westergren addressed all the JNOV breach-of-contract bases\n              fairly presented by the Plank Parties.\n      As an initial matter, the Plank Parties assert that we can affirm JNOV on\nWestergren’s breach-of-contract claim due to Westergren’s alleged failure to\naddress one of the Plank Parties’ alleged JNOV grounds. We disagree. In their\nJNOV motion, instead of arguing that partial performance is an equitable doctrine\nunder which a party only may recover reliance damages for breach of contract, as\nthey do in their appellate brief, the Plank Parties merely coupled the lack of legally\nsufficient evidence of partial performance with the lack of a damages question\nbased on reliance damages to argue that all of Westergren’s damages findings fail\n(ground 6 above). The Plank Parties did not directly attack the jury’s finding on\nbreach-of-contract damages. In addition, in their JNOV motion, the Plank Parties\nonly cited cases dealing with non-contract causes of action.13\n\n      While the Plank Parties cited Exxon Corp. v. Breezevale Ltd. in the brief in\nsupport of their motion for JNOV, they cited it for the propositions that the partial-\nperformance exception to the statute of frauds was inapplicable and that, because\nthe statute of frauds rendered the alleged oral partnership agreement unenforceable,\nthe Plank Parties could not be liable for any damages resulting from breach of\n\n\n      13\n          See, e.g., Baylor Univ. v.

See id. at 441. Although the Plank Parties may\nhave presented this argument orally at the JNOV hearing, the transcript, if any,\nfrom the hearing is not in the record. In any event, we should consider only\ngrounds stated in writing to support the motion. See TEX. R. CIV.

The evidence is legally sufficient to support Russell Plank’s\n               individual liability on the contract.\n       The Plank Parties did not plead agency14 as an affirmative defense to\nWestergren’s breach-of-contract claim.

See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830.\n\n       Westergren argues that even if Russell Plank did act at times as an agent for\nNPH, this does not mean Russell Plank was acting solely as an agent and never at\nall in his individual capacity when he made promises to Westergren. Westergren\ncontends that the trial record shows Russell Plank wore “multiple hats,” including\none as Russell Plank, individual. We agree. Russell Plank admitted that at times\nhe dealt with Westergren as an independent consultant:\n\n       Q. When you dealt with Mr. Westergren, were you dealing with him\n       as an independent consultant, or were you dealing with him as a\n       representative of National Property Holdings, or were you dealing\n       with him as a representative of the Plank Companies, Inc.?\n       A. All of the above. I’m a consultant that works for all of those\n       entities.\nRussell Plank testified that he was strictly an independent consultant for, and was\nnot a partner and did not have any ownership interests in, Michael Plank’s\ncompanies. Russell Plank denied that he had any authority to act on behalf of\nNPH—“Mike makes all decisions” with regard to NPH. Russell Plank only was\nauthorized to act on behalf of NPH by Michael Plank on “some specific issues.”\nMichael Plank confirmed that Russell Plank was a consultant for NPH and\n\n       15\n           In support, the Plank Parties relied on Walker Insurance Services v. Bottle Rock Power\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1396615\"><a href=\"/opinion/1396615/walker-ins-services-v-bottle-rock-power/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.). But Walker has\nlimited, if any, applicability because the issue was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\ntrial court’s implied finding regarding agency on a special appearance. This court specifically\nindicated “when determining whether an agency relationship existed . . . , we must be mindful\nthat the issue of ultimate liability is separate from the issue of jurisdiction.” Id. at 549.\n\n                                                14\n\fWestergren was told that. Westergren testified that he dealt extensively with and\nhad been in constant contact by cell phone with Russell Plank; Russell Plank\nagreed that he spoke to Westergren “much more” than Michael Plank did.\nWestergren and Langston both testified that their discussions regarding the $1\nmillion and profits-interest “deal” were with Russell Plank. Russell Plank called\nLangston regarding paying Westergren’s attorney’s fees in the 190-acres litigation\nbecause they were going to be “partners.” And Russell Plank admitted that he\n“personally” wrote a $5000 check to Langston. Westergren further testified it was\nRussell Plank who called to tell him that it was time to release the lis pendens.\n\n      Although Russell Plank at times may have acted as NPH’s agent, an agent is\nnot precluded from binding himself on a contract where he has pledged his own\npersonal responsibility in addition to that of his principal. See Nagle v. Duncan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409217\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409217/nagle-v-duncan/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1978, writ dism’d).\nAnd while the Plank Parties emphasize the fact that the $500,000 check paid to\nWestergren in June 2006 was issued by NPH, circumstances post contract\nformation do not relieve an agent from a finding of personal contract liability. See\nGordon v. Leasman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011,\nno pet.) (concluding such in case involving oral agreement for carpentry services\nwhere invoices were addressed to and checks issued by principal).\n\n      Based on all the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract,\nthere is more than a scintilla of probative evidence that Russell Plank acted in his\nindividual capacity with regard to the oral agreement with Westergren.              See\nTanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe jury’s finding, Westergren clearly established a fact issue as to whether Russell\nPlank was bound on the oral agreement with Westergren in Russell Plank’s\nindividual capacity. Because reasonable and fair-minded people could find the\n\n                                          15\n\fchallenged fact, if the trial court granted JNOV based on this ground, it was\nimproper. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, this ground does not\nprovide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment on breach of contract. See\nSbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n           3. The evidence is legally sufficient to support that Westergren did\n              not release his breach-of-contract claim under the MSA and the\n              Release.\n      In their motion for JNOV, the Plank Parties argued that any breach-of-\ncontract claim was released under both the terms of the MSA and the Release. The\njury found that Russell Plank’s failure to comply with his oral agreement with\nWestergren was not excused by any waiver by Westergren. In addition, the jury\nfound that each of the Plank Parties committed fraud by omission. Finally, the jury\nfound no breach of contract by Westergren with regard to either the MSA or the\nRelease.\n\n             a. The January 2006 MSA\n\n      First, we will consider whether the MSA applies to bar Westergren’s breach-\nof-contract claim. The Plank Parties argued that the evidence conclusively showed\nthat Westergren’s contract claim fell within the MSA’s broad language and thus\nwas barred as a matter of law. The Plank Parties further asserted that Russell\nPlank was covered by the MSA because at all times he acted as an agent on behalf\nof NPH.\n\n      On appeal, Westergren contends that the MSA did not release any claims\nagainst Russell Plank because the MSA fails to refer to Russell Plank with any\n“descriptive particularity or otherwise,” and thus the Plank Parties’ argument could\nnot have formed the basis for the trial court’s JNOV.\n\n      The MSA included the following language:\n\n                                        16\n\f       [A]ll parties to this Agreement agree to release, discharge any and all\n       claims, demands or suits, known or unknown, fixed or contingent,\n       liquidated or unliquidated, whether or not asserted in the above case,\n       as of this date, arising from, or related to, the events and transactions\n       which are the subject matter of this case.\nWhile “all parties” to the MSA agreed to release and discharge “any and all\nclaims” related to the “subject matter” of the 190-acres litigation, and NPH was a\nsignatory party to the MSA, there is no dispute that Russell Plank individually did\nnot sign and was not a party to the MSA. Nor does the MSA specifically refer in\nany way to the parties’ agents; certainly, nothing expressly indicates that the\nparties to the MSA intended to release Russell Plank from any and all claims.\n\n       Moreover, even assuming solely for purposes of our analysis that the MSA\nwould cover claims against agents of signatory parties, we already have concluded\nmore than a scintilla of evidence would support a reasonable jury’s finding that\nRussell Plank acted in his individual capacity, not solely as an agent for NPH, to be\nbound personally on the oral agreement with Westergren.                   See supra Section\nIV.A.2. Thus, the Plank Parties’ reliance on cases in which releases were found to\nreach a company’s employees or agents who were clearly acting in the scope of\ntheir employment or agency is misplaced.16 We therefore conclude that, viewing it\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence raised a fact issue as to\nwhether the MSA even was valid as to Russell Plank. A reasonable and fair-\nminded jury was permitted to conclude that Westergren did not release his contract\n\n       16\n           Vera v. N.

See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n            b. The June 2006 Release\n\n      The Plank Parties also argued that Westergren released his breach-of-\ncontract claim under the Release. The Plank Parties complained that Westergren\nfailed to present any evidence of fraud by omission, and therefore, Westergren’s\nfraudulent-inducement defense to the Release fails as a matter of law. Specifically,\nthe Plank Parties argued that Westergren failed to obtain a relevant jury finding\nbecause the only basis presented for his fraudulent-inducement defense was not\nfraud by omission, but rather fraud by misrepresentation.         Further, even if\nWestergren had obtained a relevant jury finding as to fraud by misrepresentation,\nthe Plank Parties argued that Westergren justifiably could not rely on the Plank\nParties’ alleged misrepresentation that the release was a “receipt.” Finally, the\nPlank Parties asserted that the plain language of the Release bars Westergren’s\ncontract claim because it covers agents of Michael Plank and NPH, and at all times\nRussell Plank was acting in such an agency capacity.\n\n      On appeal, Westergren argues the evidence shows that Westergren’s\nsignature on the Release was procured by fraud and the jury’s findings are\nconsistent with and support Westergren’s fraudulent-inducement defense.\nSpecifically, the evidence shows Russell Plank did not disclose that the document\nwas actually a release; Russell Plank knew that Westergren was ignorant of that\nfact and did not have an equal opportunity to discover it because he did not have\nhis glasses; Russell Plank induced him into signing the Release by failing to reveal\nits true nature; and Westergren suffered injury as a result when the Release was\nlater used as the reason to avoid additional payment.    Westergren further argues\n\n                                        18\n\fthat the Release does not cover Russell Plank; he is not specifically mentioned in\nthe Release and, at trial, Russell Plank testified that he was “not a party\nindividually” to the Release.\n\n       Here, the trial court submitted various fraud questions17 to the jury with the\nfollowing understanding: “that plaintiff is seeking damages for material\nmisrepresentation and is alleging fraud by omission as the theory for its\nfraudulent[-]inducement defense to the enforcement of the June 2006 release.”18\nWestergren offered no objection to this characterization of his case to be presented\nin the charge. Thus, question 14 on fraud by omission was submitted as the\nquestion pertinent to whether the Release was “subject to avoidance” on the\nground of fraudulent inducement. See Williams v.

Question 19, the\ndamages question associated with the fraud claims, was predicated on an affirmative answer to\nquestion 13 or 15.\n       18\n          The trial court previously had denied the Plank Parties’ motion for summary judgment\nbased on the Release.\n\n                                              19\n\f            Fraud occurs when:\n                   a) a party fails to disclose a material fact within the\n                      knowledge of the party,\n                   b) the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the\n                      fact and does not have an equal opportunity to\n                      discover the truth,\n                   c) the party intends to induce the other party to take\n                      some action by failing to disclose the fact, and\n                   d) the other party suffers injury as a result of acting\n                      without knowledge of the undisclosed fact.\n\n      On question 14, the jury answered “yes” with respect to each of NPH,\nMichael Plank, and Russell Plank. We disagree that Westergren failed to present\nany evidence of fraud by omission. Russell Plank testified that the Release was\ndrafted by the Plank Parties’ attorneys, not by Westergren, and Russell Plank read\nand approved it before having Westergren sign it. Westergren testified that Russell\nPlank called him and told him that he should come to the NPH office to pick up the\nfirst half of the million dollars. Russell Plank was aware that Westergren had\n“eyesight problems.” Westergren testified that he did not take his reading glasses\nwhen he went to pick up his check, that Westergren could not read the document\nRussell Plank “needed” him to sign, but after Westergren asked Russell Plank\n“[w]hat’s that?”, Russell Plank told Westergren he was signing “nothing,” “just a\nreceipt,” and he did not “have to worry about it.” Westergren testified what\nRussell Plank did not tell him was that the document was a “release of all claims.”\nWestergren testified he “absolutely” relied on the fact that Russell Plank told\nWestergren the document was “just a receipt” without telling him it was a release\nin executing and signing the Release. Russell Plank testified, “We put things in\n[the Release] because we—we just didn’t—we didn’t—Gordon was a loose\ncannon. We had no idea what he was capable of.” Westergren testified that as he\nleft this meeting, Russell Plank told Westergren he would receive “the other half”\n                                        20\n\fwhen “we get another building coming out of the ground.” Westergren did not\nknow that what he signed was a release until he met with Michael Plank who told\nhim “you need to read what you sign” and that he would not pay Westergren “an\nf’ing dime” more. Westergren never received the other $500,000 and 5% profit\ninterest.\n\n       In addition, Russell Plank, after working directly with the Plank Parties’\nattorneys on drafting the Release, never provided Westergren’s attorney Langston\nwith a copy of the Release before asking Westergren to sign it. This is despite the\nfacts that Russell Plank knew Langston represented Westergren in legal matters\nrelated to the 190 acres, Russell Plank personally had written a $5000 check to pay\nWestergren’s attorney’s fees in connection with the 190 acres, and Langston had\n“many thousand[s]” of discussions with Russell Plank about putting the oral\nagreement with Westergren related to the 190 acres—the very reason why\nWestergren signed the MSA and released his lis pendens—in writing. This is also\ndespite the facts that the document Russell Plank conditioned receiving the\n$500,000 check on was a “professional” attorney-drafted agreement regarding and\nrelease of Westergren’s legal claims related to the 190 acres; Russell Plank had his\nattorneys “put things” in the Release because he “had no idea what [Westergren]\nwas capable of”; and that the custom and practice of communications among\nattorneys is to deal strictly with the attorney representing “the other guy’s client,”\nwhich includes providing that attorney with copies of documents.            Langston\ntestified that he was unable to advise Westergren about his legal rights under the\ndocument because he did not receive a copy of it until almost a year after\nWestergren signed it, and that the first thing Langston said when he read the\nRelease was “[s]omething like, Oh my god.” Although Westergren generally was\na “handshake” deal man, Russell Plank certainly knew Westergren had retained\n\n\n                                         21\n\fcounsel for matters related to the 190 acres. Russell Plank’s actions in connection\nwith the Release thus provide ample circumstantial evidence of his intent to\ndefraud Westergren. See Anderson, Greenwood & Co. v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772832\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772832/anderson-greenwood-co-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n215 (Tex.

See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1574363\"><a href=\"/opinion/1574363/first-city-mortg-co-v-gillis/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146–47 (Tex.

Id. at 147 (“If no fraud is involved, one who\nsigns an agreement without knowledge of its contents is presumed to have\nconsented to its terms and is charged with knowledge of the agreement's legal\neffect.”).20    Moreover, there need not be a fiduciary relationship between the\nparties to support fraud by omission.21 See Solutioneers Consulting, 237 S.W.3d at\n\n       19\n         First City Mortgage involved a broker-principal fiduciary relationship in the context of\nan attempt to secure financing.\n       20\n          In their appellate brief, the Plank Parties also rely on Bradford v. Vento, where the\nTexas Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff’s fraud-by-omission claim failed because there\nwas no evidence that the defendant “knew that [the plaintiff] lacked information and did not have\n‘an equal opportunity to discover the truth.’” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358790\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358790/bradford-v-vento/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (Tex. 2001). Bradford is\ndistinguishable because, here, after coming in to purportedly receive the first half of the million\ndollars, Westergren expressly asked Russell Plank what Westergren was signing, and there was\nevidence that Westergren had not brought his reading glasses and that Russell Plank knew\nWestergren needed glasses to read documents. Further, the fact that Russell Plank proceeded to\njoke about Westergren’s not spending all of the $500,000 check quickly just in case Russell\nPlank would not be able to give Westergren his other half—after Westergren already had signed\nthe Release—constitutes evidence that Russell Plank knew Westergren was ignorant of and\nlacked information about the Release’s terms. And the fact that, after consulting with the Plank\nParties’ own attorneys on the Release, Russell Plank did not provide Westergren’s attorney with\na copy of the Release reasonably supports an inference that Russell Plank knew Westergren did\nnot have an “equal opportunity to discover the truth” of the Release’s terms.\n       21\n            In their JNOV motion, the Plank Parties did not argue that Westergren failed to show\n                                                22\n\f385 (explaining that duty to disclose also may arise “when one party voluntarily\ndiscloses information, which gives rise to the duty to disclose the whole truth,”\n“when one party makes a representation, which gives rise to the duty to disclose\nnew information that the party is aware makes the earlier representation misleading\nor untrue,” or “when one party makes a partial disclosure and conveys a false\nimpression, which gives rise to the duty to speak”).          Where Russell Plank,\nindividually, and Westergren had entered into an alleged oral agreement; where\nRussell Plank had made representations that he would pay Westergren $1 million\nand a 5% profit interest in the sale of the 190 acres; where Russell Plank knew that\nWestergren was represented by counsel in matters related to the 190 acres; where\nRussell Plank had directly worked with his attorneys to draft a document that\nwould release all of Westergren’s claims in the 190 acres; where Russell Plank did\nnot provide a copy of the Release to Langston; and where Russell Plank answered\nWestergren’s direct question as to what he was signing with it was a “just a\nreceipt” for the $500,000 and did not tell him it actually included a release of all\nclaims, Russell Plank had a duty to disclose that he would pay only $500,000 for\nWestergren’s releasing all his claims as the whole truth, because he was aware this\nnew information made his earlier representations misleading or untrue, and to\navoid conveying a false impression See id.\n\n       Here, the evidence indicates that Russell Plank called Westergren in to\nreceive the first half of his “cool million”; presented Westergren with a document\n“drawn by professionals” and that Russell Plank had approved without first\nsending a copy to Westergren’s attorney for his review; told Westergren that he\n“needed” to sign it; after being expressly asked by Westergren what he was\nsigning, told him it was “just a receipt” and did not disclose that it was an agreement\n\nany other basis for Russell Plank’s duty to disclose.\n\n                                                23\n\fand included a release of all claims; and continued to refer to the existence of the\noral agreement he had with Westergren even after the Release was signed. From\nRussell Plank’s actions, a reasonable jury was free to infer he knew and had\nconcealed or failed to disclose the material fact that the document was a release of\nWestergren’s claims; he knew Westergren did not know that the document was a\nrelease and did not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth; he intended to\ninduce Westergren to sign the Release by deliberately failing to disclose that fact;\nand Westergren was injured by signing the document without knowing it was a\nrelease. In other words, that Russell Plank induced Westergren into signing the\nRelease by committing fraud by omission or nondisclosure. Therefore, based on\nour review of the evidence in the light most favorable to, and indulging every\nreasonable inference that would support, the jury’s affirmative finding, we\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence upon which a reasonable and\nfair-minded jury could conclude Westergren had proven each of the elements of\nfraud by omission as to Russell Plank. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823,\n827.22 Because we conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence to support\n\n       22\n          Because we conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\naffirmative finding on fraud by omission with regard to Russell Plank and this jury finding\nserves in support of Westergren’s defense to the Release, to finally dispose of this appeal, we\nneed not address the Plank Parties’ contention on JNOV that even if the jury’s findings on fraud\nby misrepresentation within another fraud question could support Westergren’s fraudulent-\ninducement defense, Westergren justifiably could not rely on the alleged “receipt”\nmisrepresentation as a matter of law because he failed to read the Release. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n47.1. In any event, this situation is distinguishable from that addressed by the en banc court in\nDRC Parts & Accessories, L.L.C. v.

Id. at 910.\n\n      The jury found that Russell Plank agreed to pay Westergren $1 million and a\n5% profit interest in the development of the 190 acres. The jury further found\nRussell Plank partially performed that agreement.\n\n                                           30\n\f      Here, Westergren testified that the only reason he agreed to “walk away”\nfrom the mediation for “nothing” and sign the MSA was because Russell Plank had\npromised to make him a partner and pay him $1 million and a 5% profit interest for\nreleasing his lis pendens and claim to the 190 acres. Russell Plank told Westergren\n“not to worry,” that they just needed to “get these guys out of the way” by way of\nthe mediation and the MSA. Westergren “absolutely” relied on Russell Plank’s\npromises in agreeing to and later signing away his lis pendens.          Langston\nconfirmed, “That’s what [Westergren] did in reliance on the representations that\nhad been made to him,” and that Russell Plank shared these same representations\nwith Langston. As a result of Westergren’s signing away his lis pendens, the Plank\nParties “got full control” of the 190 acres. NPH (on its own and through a\npartnership) was able to purchase the 190 acres, received a $6 million distribution\nfrom ML Realty Partners, and resold 20 acres at a higher price for square foot. If\nWestergren successfully had pursued his claim to the 190 acres, he would have\n“the right to go out and buy the 190 acres.” After Westergren released his lis\npendens and dismissed his claim, he requested payment on the agreement. Russell\nPlank told Westergren to come pick up the first half of his $1 million, a “partial\npayment.” Russell Plank did not tell Westergren that he was signing a release\nwhen he received a check for $500,000 but instead told him it was “just a receipt.”\nAt the time of payment, the check was described in NPH’s accounting as for\n“Land-Fixed Asset”; over five months later, this description was changed to\n“Consulting Fees.” When Westergren left with the check, Russell Plank joked\nwith Westergren that he should not spend all the money too quickly just in case\nRussell Plank was not “able to give [Westergren] the other half.” Russell Plank\ntestified that it was he who convinced Michael Plank to pay the $500,000 to\nWestergren: “I talked Mike into paying Gordon a half a million dollars.” Michael\nPlank in “no way” wanted to pay any money to Westergren because Westergren\n                                        31\n\fdid not do “any work” or “anything” to merit being paid. Johnson testified that\nneither of the Planks ever told him that Westergren was a “consultant,” and ML\nRealty Partners’ CEO did not include Westergren on the list of individuals\ninvolved “on the NPH side.”\n\n              a. Whether Russell Plank’s actions are “unequivocally referable” to\n                 his contract with Westergren\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s partial-\nperformance finding, we conclude that Westergren raised a fact issue on whether\nRussell Plank’s actions were unequivocally referable to their oral agreement. The\nfact that the $500,000 check was drawn on NPH’s bank account is not dispositive\nbecause there was clear evidence it was Russell Plank who “pushed” his brother to\n“try to get [Westergren] paid.” See Bookout, 165 S.W.3d at 911 (concluding\nsufficient evidence supported partial performance despite source of check\npayments at issue).27 Russell Plank succeeded in his efforts; Michael Plank finally\nagreed to pay Westergren.\n\n       In addition, that NPH’s accounting notation on the check later was changed\nfrom “Land-Fixed Asset” to “Consulting Fees” does not necessarily mean Russell\nPlank’s conduct in connection with the payment is equally referable to some other\ncontractual arrangement with Westergren. See id. (explaining that jury was free to\nconclude that check payments at issue were evidence of partial performance on\ncontract to purchase chiropractic clinic “notwithstanding the way in which they\nwere marked”).

Nor did NPH consider Westergren\nits consultant. Russell Plank indicated Michael Plank was “adamant” Westergren\nnot be paid because “[h]e didn’t understand why we had to pay Gordon anything.”\nAnd Michael Plank specifically admitted “we never had a contract with\n[Westergren] for anything.”28\n\n       Nor can we view the $500,000 check in isolation. Westergren testified that\nRussell Plank told him this payment represented only the first half of the “cool\nmillion” and joked that Westergren should not spend it all at once in case Russell\nPlank was unable to “give [him] the other half.” And we already have concluded\nthat Westergren presented more than a scintilla of evidence to support his\nfraudulent-inducement defense to the Release with regard to Russell Plank. Thus,\nwe reject the argument that the $500,000 payment was equally referable to the\nRelease or to any alleged arrangement with NPH.\n\n               b. Whether Westergren’s actions are “unequivocally referable” to\n                  his contract with Russell Plank\n\n       To the extent the Plank Parties also argued that Westergren’s actions were\nnot “unequivocally referable” to his contract with Russell Plank, we also conclude\nWestergren raised a fact issue as to whether his own actions were unequivocally\nreferable to their oral agreement.

While the MSA contained a merger clause, we already have determined that\nno merger occurred as to Russell Plank individually.

Whether permitting Russell Plank to escape liability would amount\n                to a “virtual fraud”\n\n       We also conclude that Westergren raised a fact issue on whether the failure\nto enforce the oral agreement would result in a “virtual fraud.” Westergren and his\nattorney both testified that Westergren acted in reliance on the contract with\nRussell Plank to his substantial detriment, giving up his right to otherwise purchase\nand develop the 190 acres, a site that had attracted several real estate developers.\nThere is also evidence that Russell Plank would reap an unearned benefit if\npermitted to plead the statute of frauds. Essentially, NPH was able to purchase the\nentire 190 acres—receiving a $6 million distribution from ML Realty Partners, and\nselling a 20-acre parcel for over two and half times its purchase price. As paid\nconsultant for NPH, Russell Plank clearly stood to benefit from this “massive”\nproject.\n\n             d. Here, the jury was free to determine whether the partial-\n                performance exception applied.\n\n      Based on our review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s\nfindings, we conclude more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support that the\nparties’ performance here sufficiently established the partial-performance\n      29\n          “No representations warranties or inducements have been made to any party by any\nother party concerning this Agreement . . . .” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                           34\n\fexception to the statute of frauds. See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830. Therefore, a\nreasonable and fair-minded jury was free to answer “yes” with regard to Russell\nPlank on the partial-performance question. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823,\n827. Thus, this ground does not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s\ngranting JNOV on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n            7. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s damages\n               finding on breach of contract.\n       As discussed supra in Section IV.A.1, the Plank Parties urged in their JNOV\nmotion that because there is no legally sufficient evidence of partial performance,\nall of the jury’s damages findings fail.             The Plank Parties did not argue\nspecifically, until after the trial court entered its judgment, that even if the partial-\nperformance exception applied, Westergren would not be entitled to any damages\nbased on a benefit-of-the-bargain measure.               Therefore, we concluded that\nWestergren did not waive his JNOV complaint by failing to address this particular\nissue on appeal.\n\n       Even assuming the Plank Parties fairly had presented this issue, we conclude\nthat the jury properly could award Westergren damages on his breach-of-contract\nclaim. True, in Exxon, the court concluded in dicta that even if successful in\nremoving the oral agreement at issue from the statute of frauds because of partial\nperformance, the plaintiff only would be entitled to reliance damages. 82 S.W.3d\nat 441. But this conclusion is suspect because the Exxon court simply extended,\nwithout any analysis, the rule that a party may only recover reliance damages in\ncases involving application of the promissory-estoppel exception to the statute of\nfrauds.

(“Where a contract is executed on one side and nothing remains but the\npayment of the consideration, this may be recovered notwithstanding the Statute of\nFrauds.”). Because Westergren fully performed, the only thing left was for him to\nbe paid the agreed-upon consideration—in other words, for him to receive the\nremainder of his benefit of the bargain, just as Russell Plank already had.31\n\n       31\n           Many of our treatises on contracts and the statute of frauds note this essential\ndistinction. See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF CONTRACTS § 219 (1932) (full performance has\nthe same effect as if statute of frauds had been satisfied); 37 C.J.S. Statute of Frauds § 190\n(2010) (party who has completely performed can sue under law for benefit of the bargain); 41\nTEX. JUR. 3D Statute of Frauds § 115 (2012) (part performance is ordinarily regarded as a strictly\nequitable doctrine, available in equity courts only, whereas complete performance by one party is\nfrequently regarded as taking the contract out of the statute, even in an action at law); 41 TEX.\nJUR. 3D Statute of Frauds § 117 (2012) (when one party has fully performed and other party\n                                               36\n\f       The jury found damages in favor of Westergren on his breach-of-contract\nclaim against Russell Plank in the amount of $500,000—“[t]he difference, if any,\nbetween the amount Gordon Westergren received from the Defendants and the\namount he would have received if the Defendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon\namount.” We already have concluded there is legally sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could have found that Russell Plank partially and\nWestergren fully performed their respective ends of the agreement.                Russell\nPlank’s partial performance related to paying the first half of the $1 million due\nWestergren, and Westergren testified that he was still owed the other $500,000, as\nwell as a 5% profit interest in the development of the 190 acres. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s damages finding, we thus\nconclude that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support a reasonable and\nfair-minded jury’s award of $500,000 in contract damages.              See Tanner, 289\nS.W.3d at 830; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Thus, even if fairly\npresented, this ground does not provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s\ngranting JNOV on breach of contract. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n           8. The evidence does not conclusively establish the Plank Parties’\n              affirmative defenses to Westergren’s contract claim.\n       When a movant for JNOV challenges an adverse finding on an affirmative\ndefense, it must conclusively establish all vital facts in support of that defense.\nMosqueda v.

The Plank Parties argued in their motion for JNOV\nthe trial court should disregard the jury’s finding that Russell Plank’s failure to\ncomply was not excused “because the evidence conclusively established the\n\npartially has performed, the fully performing party is entitled to full consideration under\ncontract).\n\n                                            37\n\faffirmative defenses of waiver, prior material breach, and quasi-estoppel.” On\nappeal, Westergren complains that the Plank Parties did not support this issue with\nany record or case citations, and thus did not meet their burden of proof.\n\n      The jury found that Russell Plank’s failure to comply was not excused by\nwaiver, prior material breach, or quasi-estoppel. With regard to waiver, we already\nhave concluded that the evidence presents at least a fact issue as to whether\nWestergren released any claims against Russell Plank in the MSA and the Release.\nSee supra Section IV.A.3. Thus, even if the Plank Parties had pointed to specific\nevidence in support, it would not conclusively establish all vital facts for this\ndefense. See Dow Chem., 46 S.W.3d at 241–42. With regard to prior material\nbreach, the only arguable bases for any such breach by Westergren would be the\nMSA and the Release, so again the Plank Parties could not have met their burden.\nAnd finally, the only arguable bases for a quasi-estoppel defense also relate to\nWestergren’s position taken in the MSA or the Release. Therefore, because the\nPlank Parties have the burden of proof on their affirmative defenses, and because\nthey failed to prove they were entitled to them as a matter of law, we conclude that\nwe cannot sustain JNOV on this ground. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n          9. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the existence of an\n             agreement between Westergren and Russell Plank, that Russell\n             Plank failed to comply with that agreement, and that Westergren\n             suffered damages of $500,000 as a result.\n      We already have addressed most aspects of this ground elsewhere. In sum,\nWestergren and Langston both testified regarding Russell Plank’s promise to pay\nWestergren $1 million and a profit interest (ultimately set at 5%) in the\ndevelopment of the 190 acres. There is no dispute that Westergren only received a\ncheck in the amount of $500,000, and Russell Plank did not pay Westergren\nanything beyond the $500,000. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most\n\n                                         38\n\ffavorable to the jury’s findings, and indulging every reasonable inference to\nsupport them, we conclude that more than a scintilla of evidence exists to support\nthe findings that an agreement existed, that Russell Plank breached it, and that\nWestergren suffered damages of $500,000. See Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830; City\nof Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827. Having concluded that we cannot uphold the\ntrial court’s judgment on any of the grounds asserted in the Plank Parties’ motion\nfor JNOV with regard to breach of contract, we conclude that Westergren has met\nhis burden to show error and we sustain his first issue. See Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d at\n394.   Thus, we reverse the trial court’s judgment as it pertains to—and we\nreinstate—the jury’s findings related to Westergren’s breach-of-contract claim on\nquestions 1, 2, 4, and 5, and partially reinstate the jury’s findings on questions 3\nand 14 only with regard to Russell Plank.\n\n             10.We must remand for a new trial on Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\n       Having concluded that Westergren is entitled to reversal and reinstatement\nof the jury’s findings related to his contract claim, we consider whether we also\ncan reinstate the jury’s award of $200,000 for attorney’s fees for trial, and\ncontingent fees of $25,000 for this appeal and $20,000 for a petition of review to\nthe Texas Supreme Court.32 The Plank Parties in their motion for JNOV argued\nthat the jury’s attorney’s fee award was improper because no evidence supported\nthe specific amount awarded and because Westergren’s counsel admitted that he\ndid not segregate fees among contract and tort claims. On appeal, Westergren\ncontends that the amount awarded is within the range supported by the evidence\nand that segregation is not required where services are rendered in connection with\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that prosecuting\nand defending them entail the same facts.

When discrete legal services advance\nboth recoverable and unrecoverable claims, attorneys are not required to segregate\nfees to recover the total amount covering all claims. Id. (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d\nat 313). In this situation, the claims are said to be “intertwined,” and the mere fact\nthat attorney’s fees are incurred in advancing both recoverable and unrecoverable\nclaims does not render those fees unrecoverable. Id. (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n313–14). But if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which fees are\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Id.\nat 82 (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313). “[T]he evidence of the amount of\nrecoverable attorney’s fees is sufficiently segregated if, for example, the attorney\ntestifies that a given percentage of the drafting time would have been necessary\neven if the claim for which attorney’s fees are not recoverable had not been\nasserted.” Id. (citation omitted). The party seeking to recover attorney’s fees\ncarries the burden of demonstrating that fee segregation is not required. Id.\n\n      The only testimony provided by Westergren’s attorney was that he had not\nsegregated any fees among claims for which fees are recoverable versus\nunrecoverable because he did not think it was “necessary.”          Notwithstanding\nWestergren’s argument that the facts are interrelated, the Texas Supreme Court\nexpressly has held “[i]ntertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable.” Id. at\n\n                                         40\n\f83 (quoting Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313). Instead, the focus is whether the legal\nwork performed pertains solely to claims for which attorney’s fees are\nunrecoverable. Id. (citing 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v.

(citing 7979 Airport Garage, 245 S.W.3d at 509).\n\n      While Westergren’s contract and tort claims may have involved developing\nsome of the same facts and presenting some of the same evidence, Westergren has\nfailed to present evidence that his partnership and fraud claims did not require any\nsolely separate drafting, legal research, or discovery. See id. at 84. Therefore,\nWestergren has failed to demonstrate that segregation of fees is not required.\nHowever, Westergren did not forfeit his right to recover attorney’s fees by failing\nto segregate them, and “[t]he evidence he presented regarding the total amount of\nattorney’s fees he incurred is some evidence of what the segregated amount should\nbe.” See id. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the trial court’s judgment\ndisregarding the jury’s finding on Westergren’s attorney’s fees, and remand for a\nnew trial on attorney’s fees. See id. at 81, 84 (citing A.G.

Whether the trial court erred in disregarding the jury’s partnership\n         and fraud findings\n      In issues two and three, Westergren argues that the trial court erred in\ndisregarding the jury’s findings in his favor on his partnership and affirmative\nfraud claims. With regard to Westergren’s partnership claims, the jury awarded\nhim $177,608, or “[t]he difference, if any, between the amount Gordon Westergren\nreceived from the Defendants and the amount he would have received if the\nDefendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon amount.” With regard to Westergren’s\n\n\n                                        41\n\ffraud-by-misrepresentation and statutory fraud claims, the jury awarded him zero\ndollars, or “[t]he difference, if any, between the amount Gordon Westergren\nreceived from the Defendants and the amount he would have received if the\nDefendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon amount.” In the contract damages\nquestion, the jury awarded Westergren $500,000 as “[t]he difference, if any,\nbetween the amount Gordon Westergren received from the Defendants and the\namount he would have received if the Defendants had paid him the agreed[-]upon\namount.” Thus, for each of his theories of liability, Westergren alleged, and the\njury was asked the same measure of damages for, a single financial injury—the\nremaining benefit of the bargain due to him.\n\n      Under the one-satisfaction rule, a claimant is entitled to only one recovery\nfor any damages suffered.

The rule applies when different parties commit the same act or when\ndifferent acts cause the same injury.

Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Westergren\n          leave to amend his petition\n       In his fourth issue, Westergren asserts that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in denying him leave to amend his petition during trial to plead lack of\nconsideration as an affirmative defense to the MSA. Because we already have\nsustained Westergren’s first issue to reinstate the jury’s findings in his favor\nregarding his contract claim, we need not address this issue to finally dispose of\nthis appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n       D. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in its award of costs\n\n       Both Westergren and the Plank Parties requested court costs in the trial\ncourt.

Under the Release, Westergren “does hereby fully and unconditionally\nrelease and forever relinquish” various rights, titles, and interests, and Westergren\nalso “does hereby fully and unconditionally remise, release and forever discharge”\nvarious claims.     Neither of these contracts contains any language in which\nWestergren indemnifies, holds harmless, protects, or defends any of the Plank\nParties. These contracts do not contain any language in which the parties agree\nthat any of the released parties may recover their attorney’s fees and defense costs\nagainst Westergren if he files suit based upon any of the released claims. Nor do\nthese contracts contain any language in which Westergren expressly agrees,\npromises, or covenants that he will not file suit based upon any of the released\nclaims. See Watson v.

(concluding that “nothing in the contract represents a clear, express waiver of\n[plaintiff’s] right to sue [defendant] for alleged violations of the law”).\n\n      The Plank Parties do not assert that either contract contains such language.\nInstead, the Plank Parties argue that a release constitutes a promise not to bring a\nlawsuit based upon the released claims. The Plank Parties essentially argue that,\nby agreeing to release and discharge certain claims, a party necessarily and\nimplicitly agrees that he will not file suit based upon any of the released claims.\nUnder this proffered construction, the plain meaning of the release language in the\nMSA and the Release would include a promise not to file suit based upon any of\nthe released claims. We conclude that this construction is not a valid one.\n\n      A release of claims operates to discharge the released parties from these\nclaims and to extinguish these claims against the released parties as effectively as\n\n                                           46\n\fwould a prior judgment between the parties.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). Therefore, a\nrelease of a claim is an absolute bar to any right of action by the releasing party on\nthe claim, and a release is an affirmative defense in a lawsuit in which the releasing\nparty asserts a released claim. See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann,\n76 S.W.3d at 565. On the other hand, an indemnity is a promise to safeguard or\nhold harmless the indemnitee against either existing or future liability. See Dresser\nIndus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565. Unlike a release, which\ndischarges a released claim, an indemnity creates a potential cause of action in the\nindemnitee against the indemnitor.             See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508;\nLehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565.\n\n       Thus, the release language contained in the MSA and the Release provides\nthe released parties with an affirmative defense that bars any claims by the\nreleasing parties on these claims, but this language does not give the released\nparties a breach-of-contract claim for damages resulting from a releasing party’s\nsuit against the released parties on these claims. See Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at\n508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565.36 The released parties only would have such a\nclaim if the contract in question also contained language in which the releasing\nparties agreed not to file suit based upon any of the released claims.

Though the Ganske court reversed a summary judgment dismissing a\nclaim for breach of a settlement agreement against a releasing party who filed suit\non released claims, the court did not analyze or discuss the language of the\nsettlement agreement giving rise to the releasing party’s obligation not to file suit\non these claims. See id. Ganske thus does not support the proposition that release\nlanguage in a settlement agreement includes a promise not to file suit based upon\nany of the released claims.

In this case, we did not address whether any release language in\na settlement agreement includes a promise not to file suit based upon any of the\nreleased claims. See id. In addition, the settlement agreement in that case did not\ncontain release language, but instead contained an express promise not to sue. See\nid. at *3. P&S Corp. is thus not on point.\n\n      We conclude that, as to the issue of whether Westergren promised not to file\nsuit based upon any of the released claims, the MSA and Release are unambiguous.\nUnder the plain meaning of these contracts, Westergren released certain claims but\n\n                                         48\n\fdid not promise to refrain from filing suit based upon any of the released claims.\nSee Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508; Lehmann, 76 S.W.3d at 565. Considering\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged findings, indulging every\nreasonable inference that would support them, crediting favorable evidence if\nreasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable\njurors could not, the evidence would enable a reasonable and fair-minded jury to\nconclude that Westergren did not breach the MSA or the Release. See City of\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 823, 827; Yeh v. David J.

Therefore, the evidence is legally sufficient\nto support the jury’s failure to find that Westergren breached either contract.\n\n      In addition, the evidence is factually sufficient. Examining the entire record,\nconsidering both the evidence in favor of, and contrary to, the challenged finding,\nand considering and weighing all the evidence, we conclude the jury’s finding that\nWestergren did not breach the MSA or the Release was not so contrary to the\noverwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.\nSee Jackson, 116 S.W.3d at 761; Yeh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">183712</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (concluding\nevidence was factually sufficient to support jury’s failure to find contract breach).\nAccordingly, we overrule the Plank Parties’ first and second cross-issues.\n\n      In a conditional cross-issue, the Plank Parties assert that if this court reverses\nthe JNOV and enters judgment for Westergren, any recovery must be limited to\n$200,000 pursuant to the “Agreement to Limit Third-Party Defendants Indemnity\nExposure,” entered into by Westergren and various other parties (the “Frontier\nParties”).

CONCLUSION\n\n      As to the Plank Parties’ motion to disregard jury findings regarding the\nbreach-of-contract claim, Westergren has shown that each independent ground of\nthe motion fails to provide a basis for affirming the trial court’s judgment. Thus,\nwe reverse the trial court’s judgment with regard to, and reinstate in their entirety,\nthe jury’s findings on questions 1, 2, 4, and 5, and partially reinstate the jury’s\nfindings on questions 3 and 14 only with regard to Russell Plank. As a result, we\nalso reverse the trial court’s judgment disregarding the jury’s finding on question\n26 as to Westergren’s attorney’s fees; however, because we conclude that\nWestergren failed to demonstrate that segregation of his awarded attorney’s fees\nwas not required, we remand for a new trial on Westergren’s attorney’s fees.\nBecause Westergren is the only successful party, we also reverse the trial court’s\njudgment with regard to its allocation of court costs and remand for reallocation.\nFinally, because Westergren achieved the greatest recovery for his contract claim,\nwe otherwise affirm the trial court’s judgment with regard to Westergren’s\npartnership and fraud claims.\n\n      Under the plain meaning of the language in the MSA and the Release,\nWestergren did not promise to refrain from filing suit based on any of the allegedly\nreleased claims. Therefore, the record evidence is legally and factually sufficient\n\n                                         50\n\fto support the jury’s findings that Westergren did not breach any contract, and we\naffirm that portion of the trial court’s judgment that the Plank Parties take nothing\non their counterclaims. Accordingly, the trial court’s judgment is affirmed in part\nand reversed in part, and we remand for limited proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                       /s/    Tracy Christopher\n                                              Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Frost, Christopher, and McCally.
