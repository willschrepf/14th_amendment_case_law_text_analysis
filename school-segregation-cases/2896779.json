The Attorney\n\nGeneral has moved to dismiss Johnson’s petition on the ground that the BIA’s order was\n\nan exercise of discretion over which this Court lacks jurisdiction. For the reasons\n\nprovided below, we will grant the Attorney General’s motion.\n\n       In an Order to Show Cause dated January 17, 1997, the former Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (“INS”) charged Johnson with being deportable as a result of his\n\nconviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within one thousand feet of\n\nschool property. Johnson conceded his deportability but sought a waiver pursuant to\n\nformer Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(c) (repealed 1996). The Immigration Judge (“IJ”) found Johnson to be statutorily\n\nineligible for this relief and ordered his deportation to Guyana, and the BIA affirmed the\n\nIJ’s decision in an order dated January 29, 1998. On March 29, 2005, Johnson filed a\n\nMotion to Reopen pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 320 (2001), and the\n\nregulations implementing that decision, promulgated at 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(g) (2004). The\n\nBIA granted the motion and remanded the matter to the IJ.1 This time, it was undisputed\n\nthat Johnson was statutorily eligible for a § 212(c) waiver, so the only issue before the IJ\n\nwas whether to exercise discretion to grant such relief.\n\n       On July 21, 2006, following a hearing, the IJ denied Johnson’s request for a\n\n\n\n   1\n     Johnson had filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus with the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of New Jersey on November 14, 2000. He voluntarily dismissed the\nhabeas petition after the BIA granted his Petition to Reopen.\n                                              2\n\fwaiver. The IJ concluded that Johnson had not shown “unusual or outstanding equities”\n\nand therefore had not met the threshold standard for discretionary relief. Cf. Matter of\n\nBuscemi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 628, 633–34 (BIA 1988) (explaining that aliens convicted of\n\nserious offenses may be required to show unusual or outstanding equities to satisfy the\n\n“threshold test for having a favorable exercise of discretion considered in his case”).\n\nJohnson appealed the IJ’s discretionary denial of a waiver to the BIA. On December 4,\n\n2006, the BIA dismissed Johnson’s appeal on grounds slightly different from those that\n\nthe IJ had identified. The BIA rejected the IJ’s conclusion that Johnson had failed to\n\nshow “unusual or outstanding equities,” but it nonetheless denied the waiver after\n\nconcluding that, although “unusual or outstanding equities” were present, the balance of\n\nequities still weighed against Johnson. Johnson petitions for review of the BIA’s decision\n\nand asserts that this Court has jurisdiction under INA § 242(a)(1), codified at 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(1).\n\n       Under the INA, discretionary denials of relief are not subject to judicial review:\n\n                Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . . no court shall have\n                jurisdiction to review . . . any other decision or action of the Attorney\n                General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is\n                specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney\n                General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of\n                relief under section 1158(a) of this title.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.\n\n109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). The “subchapter” in question is\n\nSubchapter II in Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the United States Code, which includes 8 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                              3\n\f§ 1151 through § 1381. INA § 212(c), formerly found at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), fell within\n\nthe subchapter and stated that any decision to grant relief under this provision was within\n\n“the discretion of the Attorney General.” Thus, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) establishes that courts\n\nlack jurisdiction over § 212(c) decisions unless they fall within the exception created by 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) for review of constitutional claims or questions of law. See\n\nAvendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n       Johnson argues that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision because the\n\nBIA reversed the IJ “as a matter of law” when it rejected the IJ’s conclusion that Johnson\n\nhad failed to show “outstanding and unusual equities.” Johnson argues that by\n\nproceeding to balance the equities itself instead of remanding the matter to the IJ, the BIA\n\nexceeded its authority and usurped the IJ’s fact-finding role. Because the BIA’s action\n\nwent beyond mere review of the IJ’s discretionary decision, Johnson claims, the INA’s\n\nlimitation on judicial review of discretionary decisions does not apply.\n\n       We conclude that the BIA’s decision was no more than an exercise of discretion.\n\nJohnson fails to show that the BIA engaged in improper fact-finding. All of the facts that\n\nthe BIA cites—e.g., that Johnson’s last arrest took place while he was on probation, that\n\nhe was placed into administrative segregation during his incarceration, and that he failed\n\nto register for Selective Service—come directly from the IJ’s decision of July 21, 2006.\n\nJohnson confuses fact-finding with balancing of equities when he asserts that the BIA\n\n“did not have the right to engage in that weighing [of equities] at all pursuant to 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (2006).” In fact, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) states that the BIA may\n\n                                              4\n\fnot “engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.” It says nothing about\n\nbalancing of equities, which is allowed under 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (“The Board may\n\nreview questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from\n\ndecisions of immigration judges de novo.”).\n\n       Moreover, Johnson presents no authority for the proposition that, despite the\n\njurisdictional restrictions imposed by § 1252(a)(2), courts can review BIA decisions\n\nmerely because they engage in de novo balancing of the equities. In fact, several\n\ndecisions in other circuits have explicitly held the opposite. See, e.g., Cruz-Camey v.\n\nGonzales, 504 F.3d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that no jurisdiction exists to review\n\n“the manner in which the BIA balanced the various positive and negative factors which\n\ntypically inform the exercise of its discretion under § 1229b(a)”); Wallace v. Gonzales,\n\n463 F.3d 135, 140–41 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that no jurisdiction exists to review BIA’s\n\nreversal of IJ’s discretionary determination and that “a review of the factual record by the\n\nBIA does not convert its discretionary determination as to whether a petitioner warrants\n\nan adjustment of status into improper factfinding”); Delgado-Reyuna v. Gonzales, 450\n\nF.3d 596, 599–600 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that no jurisdiction exists to review a claim\n\nthat “the BIA improperly conducted de novo review, rather than reviewing the IJ’s\n\ndecision for clear error, when it reweighed the facts relevant to the grant of discretionary\n\nrelief.”). Johnson has not presented any reason for us to hold otherwise. He has not\n\ndemonstrated that the BIA’s weighing of the equities presents any question of law that\n\nwould allow us to review its decision under § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                              5\n\f       Johnson presents a purportedly separate argument that it was a violation of due\n\nprocess for the BIA to engage in de novo balancing of the equities instead of remanding\n\nthe matter to the IJ. We have jurisdiction to review colorable due process claims because\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(D) explicitly allows judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of\n\nlaw. Because relief under § 212(c) is purely discretionary, however, Johnson cannot\n\nshow that he has been deprived of a protected liberty or property interest. As we stated in\n\nHernandez v. Gonzales, “[a]liens who seek only discretionary relief from deportation\n\nhave no constitutional right to receive that relief.” 437 F.3d 341, 346 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nMoreover, we have held that in asylum proceedings, due process entitles an alien to no\n\nmore than: 1) fact-finding based on a record produced before the decisionmaker and\n\ndisclosed to the alien, 2) the ability to make arguments on his or her behalf, and 3) the\n\nright to an individualized determination of his or her interests. See Mudric v. Attorney\n\nGeneral, 469 F.3d 94, 100 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Abdulai v. Ashcroft, 239 F.3d 542, 549\n\n(3d Cir. 2001)). Johnson presents no serious argument that he has been deprived of any\n\nof these things. He suggests that he did not receive a full hearing because the IJ never\n\ncompleted its analysis after its determination regarding “unusual or outstanding equities”\n\nand because the BIA never provided a “reasoned explanation as to why Mr. Johnson’s\n\nconvictions outweighed all of the equities.” He never explains why the BIA’s\n\nexplanation falls short of a “reasoned” one or, more importantly, how it fails to satisfy\n\nany due process requirement. Thus, even assuming arguendo that Johnson had an interest\n\nprotected by due process, he has not presented a colorable due process claim that would\n\n                                             6\n\fprovide us with jurisdiction under § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n       In sum, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprives us of jurisdiction to entertain\n\nJohnson’s petition, and Johnson has not shown that any exception applies. Accordingly,\n\nwe will grant the Attorney General’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f",

Johnson petitions for review of the BIA’s decision\n\nand asserts that this Court has jurisdiction under INA § 242(a)(1), codified at 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(1).\n\n       Under the INA, discretionary denials of relief are not subject to judicial review:\n\n                Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . . no court shall have\n                jurisdiction to review . . . any other decision or action of the Attorney\n                General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is\n                specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney\n                General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of\n                relief under section 1158(a) of this title.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.\n\n109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). The “subchapter” in question is\n\nSubchapter II in Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the United States Code, which includes 8 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                              3\n\f§ 1151 through § 1381. INA § 212(c), formerly found at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), fell within\n\nthe subchapter and stated that any decision to grant relief under this provision was within\n\n“the discretion of the Attorney General.” Thus, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) establishes that courts\n\nlack jurisdiction over § 212(c) decisions unless they fall within the exception created by 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) for review of constitutional claims or questions of law. See\n\nAvendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794383\"><a href=\"/opinion/794383/roberto-gerardo-avendano-espejo-v-department-of-homeland-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n       Johnson argues that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision because the\n\nBIA reversed the IJ “as a matter of law” when it rejected the IJ’s conclusion that Johnson\n\nhad failed to show “outstanding and unusual equities.” Johnson argues that by\n\nproceeding to balance the equities itself instead of remanding the matter to the IJ, the BIA\n\nexceeded its authority and usurped the IJ’s fact-finding role. Because the BIA’s action\n\nwent beyond mere review of the IJ’s discretionary decision, Johnson claims, the INA’s\n\nlimitation on judicial review of discretionary decisions does not apply.\n\n       We conclude that the BIA’s decision was no more than an exercise of discretion.\n\nJohnson fails to show that the BIA engaged in improper fact-finding. All of the facts that\n\nthe BIA cites—e.g., that Johnson’s last arrest took place while he was on probation, that\n\nhe was placed into administrative segregation during his incarceration, and that he failed\n\nto register for Selective Service—come directly from the IJ’s decision of July 21, 2006.\n\nJohnson confuses fact-finding with balancing of equities when he asserts that the BIA\n\n“did not have the right to engage in that weighing [of equities] at all pursuant to 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (2006).” In fact, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) states that the BIA may\n\n                                              4\n\fnot “engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.” It says nothing about\n\nbalancing of equities, which is allowed under 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (“The Board may\n\nreview questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from\n\ndecisions of immigration judges de novo.”).\n\n       Moreover, Johnson presents no authority for the proposition that, despite the\n\njurisdictional restrictions imposed by § 1252(a)(2), courts can review BIA decisions\n\nmerely because they engage in de novo balancing of the equities. In fact, several\n\ndecisions in other circuits have explicitly held the opposite.

Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"42931\"><a href=\"/opinion/42931/delgado-reynua-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599–600 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that no jurisdiction exists to review a claim\n\nthat “the BIA improperly conducted de novo review, rather than reviewing the IJ’s\n\ndecision for clear error, when it reweighed the facts relevant to the grant of discretionary\n\nrelief.”). Johnson has not presented any reason for us to hold otherwise. He has not\n\ndemonstrated that the BIA’s weighing of the equities presents any question of law that\n\nwould allow us to review its decision under § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                              5\n\f       Johnson presents a purportedly separate argument that it was a violation of due\n\nprocess for the BIA to engage in de novo balancing of the equities instead of remanding\n\nthe matter to the IJ. We have jurisdiction to review colorable due process claims because\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(D) explicitly allows judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of\n\nlaw. Because relief under § 212(c) is purely discretionary, however, Johnson cannot\n\nshow that he has been deprived of a protected liberty or property interest. As we stated in\n\nHernandez v. Gonzales, “[a]liens who seek only discretionary relief from deportation\n\nhave no constitutional right to receive that relief.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793259\"><a href=\"/opinion/793259/domingo-antonio-hernandez-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nMoreover, we have held that in asylum proceedings, due process entitles an alien to no\n\nmore than: 1) fact-finding based on a record produced before the decisionmaker and\n\ndisclosed to the alien, 2) the ability to make arguments on his or her behalf, and 3) the\n\nright to an individualized determination of his or her interests. See Mudric v. Attorney\n\nGeneral, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796022\"><a href=\"/opinion/796022/goran-mudric-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771995\"><a href=\"/opinion/771995/olufemi-yussef-abdulai-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549\n\n(3d Cir. 2001)). Johnson presents no serious argument that he has been deprived of any\n\nof these things. He suggests that he did not receive a full hearing because the IJ never\n\ncompleted its analysis after its determination regarding “unusual or outstanding equities”\n\nand because the BIA never provided a “reasoned explanation as to why Mr. Johnson’s\n\nconvictions outweighed all of the equities.” He never explains why the BIA’s\n\nexplanation falls short of a “reasoned” one or, more importantly, how it fails to satisfy\n\nany due process requirement. Thus, even assuming arguendo that Johnson had an interest\n\nprotected by due process, he has not presented a colorable due process claim that would\n\n                                             6\n\fprovide us with jurisdiction under § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n       In sum, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprives us of jurisdiction to entertain\n\nJohnson’s petition, and Johnson has not shown that any exception applies. Accordingly,\n\nwe will grant the Attorney General’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f</pre>",
