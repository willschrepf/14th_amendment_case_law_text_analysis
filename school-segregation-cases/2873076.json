On December 29, 1999, the Bankruptcy court\nauthorized a partial distribution of United Fruit’s assets to the\nSellers. Seeking recoupment of the balance of the money\nowed to them by United Fruit, Sellers then filed suit on April\n26, 2000, against August J. Scolio, Jr., an officer and\nshareholder of United Fruit, alleging that he had breached his\nfiduciary duty under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities\nAct of 1930, as amended, 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a-499s (“PACA”).\n\n  I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n                 HISTORY\n\n       United Fruit was started by Scolio’s father in 1914.\nScolio became involved with the company in 1949 and was a\npartner by 1960. In 1965, Scolio’s father died and Scolio\nbecame the sole proprietor of the business until 1986, when\nhe sold United Fruit to John Tarantino, Irvin Rovner, and\nLarry Altman. In 1988, the owners brought in Ralph Paglia to\nmanage the company. Scolio remained an employee of\nUnited Fruit, and was responsible for paying bills and\ncalculating the employees’ pay.\n\n\n\n\n1. Our recitation of the facts is drawn from the opinion of the\nDistrict Court. See Weis-Buy Servs. v. Paglia, 307 F. Supp.\n2d 682, 685-87 (W.D. Pa. 2004)\n\n                                3\n\f       In 1994, Tarantino and Altman sold their shares,\nleaving ownership of United Fruit in the hands of Paglia\n(50%), Rover (25%), and Scolio (25%). According to Scolio,\nhe purchased shares for the benefit of Paglia who could not\nafford to buy all the shares that he wanted. Although Scolio\nclaims that he eventually intended to sell his interest to Paglia,\nhe never did so, and thus Scolio remained a shareholder at the\ntime of United Fruit’s bankruptcy.\n\n       Not only was Scolio a shareholder and employee of\nUnited Fruit, but company policy required his and Paglia’s\nsignature for disbursement of United Fruit checks. To assist\nhim in this endeavor, Scolio had a signature stamp created to\nuse when issuing United Fruit’s checks.\n\n         In June 1997, Paglia asked Scolio to retire, but\nencouraged him to remain active in the directorship of the\ncompany. Scolio ceased working for United Fruit, but\nretained his stake in the company, his position as officer, and\nhis title as vice-president. Scolio also remained a signatory on\nUnited Fruit’s bank accounts and United Fruit continued to\nuse Scolio’s signature stamp after his retirement.\nFurthermore, Scolio acted as a guarantor on transactions\nbetween United Fruit and Dollar Bank Leasing and possibly\nFirst Western Bank.\n\n       Soon after Scolio retired, United Fruit began doing\nbusiness with Weis-Buy and Brigiotta’s. From July 9, 1997\nthrough September 23, 1997, Weis-Buy sent five shipments of\nproduce to United Fruit, with payment on each shipment due\nwithin ten days. October 3, 1997 was the latest date on which\n\n                                4\n\fpayment was due for any of the Weis-Buy invoices.\nBrigiotta’s provided produce in numerous shipments to\nUnited Fruit from August 23, 1997 through February 22,\n1998. Again, payments were due within ten days of the date\nof each invoice, and March 4, 1998 was the latest date on\nwhich payment was due on any of the Brigiotta’s invoices.\nNeither Seller received any payment for the produce it\nprovided.\n\n       United Fruit filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code on December 9, 1997. The company\nceased operations in March 1998. Sellers’ claims were\ndetermined to be qualified valid PACA claims by the\nBankruptcy Court and each received a partial distribution\nfrom United Fruit’s remaining assets.\n\n        Seeking the rest of the money owed to them, Sellers\nfiled suit against Scolio in the United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Pennsylvania on April 26, 2000. In\ntheir complaint, Sellers alleged that Scolio breached his\nfiduciary duty owed to them under PACA. A bench trial was\nheld on March 19, 2003, and the District Court found Scolio\nliable and ordered judgment in favor of the Sellers. The\nDistrict Court also awarded interest and attorneys’ fees.\nScolio timely appealed.\n\n  II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fpursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5)(i)2 and 28 U.S.C. § 1367.\nWe have jurisdiction over the final decision of the District\nCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We exercise plenary review of the District Court’s\nrefusal to dismiss the case on statute of limitations grounds.\nLake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 365 (3d Cir. 2000). We review\nthe award of attorneys’ fees and interest for abuse of\ndiscretion. In re Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litig., 396 F.3d\n294, 299 (3d Cir. 2005); Anthuis v. Colt Indus. Operating\nCorp., 971 F.2d 999, 1002 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n        Scolio raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues\nthat the District Court erred when it failed to dismiss the case\non statute of limitations grounds. Second, he claims that the\nDistrict Court erred in finding him personally liable. Finally,\nScolio challenges the District Court’s award of attorneys’ fees\nand interest. Because we conclude that Sellers’ claims were\nnot timely, we do not address Scolio’s other arguments.\n\n\n   2\n        “The several district courts of the United States are\nvested with jurisdiction specifically to entertain (i) actions by\ntrust beneficiaries to enforce payment from the trust, and (ii)\nactions by the Secretary to prevent and restrain dissipation of the\ntrust.”\n\n7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5).\n\n\n                                6\n\f                          A. PACA\n\n    This Court has had few opportunities to examine\nPACA, thus we begin by examining the history and purpose\nof the statute. Congress enacted PACA in 1930 to deter\nunfair business practices and promote financial responsibility\nin the perishable agricultural goods market. Sunkist Growers\nv. Fisher, 104 F.3d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Farley\nand Calfee, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Agric., 941 F.2d\n964, 966 (9th Cir. 1991)). “The Act was ‘designed primarily\nfor the protection of the producers of perishable agricultural\nproducts--most of whom must entrust their products to a\nbuyer or commission merchant who may be thousands of\nmiles away, and depend for their payment upon his business\nacumen and fair dealing.’” Tom Lange Co. v. Kornblum &\nCo., 81 F.3d 280, 283 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting H.R. Rep. No.\n84-1196 (1955), reprinted in 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3701,\n3701).\n\n       In 1984 Congress amended PACA to allow for a non-\nsegregated floating trust for the protection of producers and\ngrowers. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543 (1983), reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Congress recognized that these\nproducers and growers tend to be small businesses in a high\ncost/high risk industry. Id. They generally have capital tied\nup in land and machinery and their survival depends on\ntimely returns on the sale of their products. Id. Congress\nexplained:\n\n           Many commission merchants, dealers, or\n      brokers, in the normal course of their business\n\n                              7\n\ftransactions, operate on bank loans secured by the\ninventories, proceeds or assigned receivables\nfrom sales of perishable agricultural commodities,\ngiving the lender a secured position in the case of\ninsolvency. Under present law, sellers of fresh\nfruits and vegetables are unsecured creditors and\nreceive little protection in any suit for recovery of\ndamages where a buyer has failed to make\npayment as required by the contract.\n\n       This legislation would provide a remedy\nby impressing a trust in favor of the unpaid seller\nor supplier on the inventories of commodities and\nproducts derived therefrom and on the proceeds\nof sale of such commodities and products in the\nhands of the commission merchant, dealer or\nbroker in the same manner that has been provided\nby ‘trust’ amendments to the Packers and\nStockyards Act adopted in 1976. The trust\nprovisions of that act have operated very\nsuccessfully without imposing a regulatory\nburden on the industry.\n\n        The trust impression by section 5(c)(2) of\nthis act is made up of a firm's commodity related\nliquid assets, and is a nonsegregated ‘floating\ntrust’, which permits the commingling of trust\nassets. In the view of the committee it provides\nthe protection needed by the trust beneficiaries\nwithout creating an undue hardship to any person.\n\n\n                         8\n\f               The committee believes that the statutory\n       trust requirements will not be a burden to the\n       lending institutions. They will be known to and\n       considered by prospective lenders in extending\n       credit. The assurance the trust provision gives\n       that raw products will be paid for promptly and\n       that there is a monitoring system provided for\n       under the act will protect the interests of the\n       borrower, the money lender, and the fruit and\n       vegetable industry. Prompt payments should\n       generate trade confidence and new business\n       which yields increased cash and receivables, the\n       prime security factors to the money lender.\n\n              These amendments would give the\n       industry and department effective new tools to\n       overcome the payment problems.\n\nId. at 406-07. It is clear that Congress intended to create a\nsystem by which producers and growers would be secured in\ntheir transaction with buyers, and in return they were expected\nto make prompt claims when the buyers failed to pay. With\nthis background, we now turn to the claims against Scolio.\n\n                    B. Individual Liability\n\n       We have not previously decided whether an individual\ncorporate officer can be held liable for breaching his or her\nfiduciary duty to protect PACA trust assets. We have\nguidance from our sister circuits, however, and several have\nconsidered this issue and have concluded that individual\n\n                               9\n\fliability does exist in certain circumstances. See Patterson\nFrozen Foods v. Crown Foods Int’l, 307 F.3d 666, 669 (7th\nCir. 2002) (recognizing that PACA permits recovery against\nboth the corporation and its controlling officers.);\nGolman-Hayden Co. v. Fresh Source Produce Inc., 217 F.3d\n348, 351 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that shareholders, officers,\nor directors who control assets may be held liable under\nPACA.); Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Fisher, 104 F.3d 280, 283\n(9th Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n        In Sunkist Growers, 104 F.3d at 283, the Ninth Circuit\nexamined the decisions of several district courts and\nconcluded that “individual shareholders, officers, or directors\nof a corporation who are in a position to control PACA trust\nassets, and who breach their fiduciary duty to preserve those\nassets, may be held personally liable under the Act.” In\nGolman-Hayden, the Fifth Circuit expressed its agreement\nwith Sunkist Growers and further explained:\n\n               PACA is a “tough law”. In addition to\n       protecting consumers, Congress expressly\n       designed it to protect the producers of perishable\n       agricultural products, most of whom must entrust\n       their products to a buyer who may be thousands of\n       miles away, and depend for their payment upon\n       his business acumen and fair dealing. An investor\n       in a perishable commodities corporation “should\n       know at the beginning of his association with\n       such a corporation that he is ‘buying into’ a\n       corporation which is strictly regulated by the\n       federal government through PACA.”\n\n                              10\n\f217 F.3d 348, 351 (internal citations and footnotes omitted).\n\n        Individual liability in the PACA context is not derived\nfrom the statutory language, but from common law breach of\ntrust principles. Sunkist Growers, 104 F.3d at 282 (“Ordinary\nprinciples of trust law apply to trusts created under PACA . . .\n.”). “Under the common law, the trustee of a trust is under a\nduty to the beneficiary in administering the trust to exercise\nsuch care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would\nexercise in dealing with his own property.” Shepard v. K.B.\nFruit & Vegetable, 868 F. Supp. 703, 706 (E.D. Pa. 1994).\nLiability arising from this duty is distinct from the liability\nthat arises when the corporate veil is pierced:\n\n              An individual who is in the position to\n       control the [PACA] trust assets and who does not\n       preserve them for the beneficiaries has breached\n       a fiduciary duty, and is personally liable for that\n       tortious act. This legal framework is to be\n       distinguished from the piercing the veil doctrine,\n       where the corporate form is disregarded because\n       the individual has either committed a fraud, or\n       because the corporation is a “shell” being used by\n       the individual shareholders to advance their own\n       purely personal rather than corporate ends.\n\n\n\n\nMorris Okun, Inc. v. Harry Zimmerman, Inc., 814 F. Supp.\n346, 348 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).\n\n\n                               11\n\f        We join those circuits that have already addressed this\nissue and hold that individual officers and shareholders, in\ncertain circumstances, may be held individually liable for\nbreaching their fiduciary duties under PACA. See Patterson\nFrozen Foods, 307 F.3d at 669; Golman-Hayden Co., 217\nF.3d at 351; Hiller Cranberry Prods. v. Koplovsky, 165 F.3d\n1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999); Sunkist Growers, Inc., 104 F.3d at 283.\nThat said, before we determine whether Scolio himself was\nproperly held liable here, we must determine whether Sellers\nbrought this action within the applicable statute of limitations\nperiod.\n\n                  C. Statute of Limitations\n\n        The District Court declined to determine whether there\nwas a limitations period applicable to the Sellers’ claims,\nholding instead that the action either did not accrue, or was\ntolled until December 29, 1999, the date the Bankruptcy court\nauthorized a partial distribution from United Fruit’s assets.\nWe believe a more thorough analysis is necessary, and we\nbegin by identifying the appropriate statute of limitations.\n\n        “Determining the statute of limitations period for\nactivity governed by a federal statute is a question of federal\nlaw.” KingVision Pay-Per-View, Corp. v. 898 Belmont, Inc.,\n366 F.3d 217, 220 (3d Cir. 2004). However, when a federal\nlaw provides the basis for the cause of action, but fails to\nsupply a statute of limitations, we must borrow an appropriate\nstatute of limitations from the law of the forum state. Id.; see\nalso North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. 29, 34 (1995).\nWe also incorporate relevant state tolling rules. Hardin v.\n\n                               12\n\fStraub, 490 U.S. 536, 539 (1989); Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d\n360, 368 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n        Because PACA does not set forth a limitations period\nfor breach of fiduciary duty claims, we look to Pennsylvania\nlaw, which provides that such claims must be brought within\ntwo years of the date the claim accrues. 42 Pa. C.S.A. §\n5524(7);3 see also In re Mushroom Transp. Co., 382 F.3d 325,\n336 (3d Cir. 2004) (recognizing a two-year statute of\nlimitations for breach of fiduciary duty claims); Maillie v.\nGreater Del. Valley Health Care, Inc., 628 A.2d 528, 532 (Pa.\nCommw. Ct. 1993) (acknowledging that 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(7)\nis the applicable statute for proceedings based upon breach of\na fiduciary duty). Therefore, Sellers claims will only be\ntimely if the Sellers brought them within two years of accrual,\nor if the statute of limitations was tolled.\n\n\n   3\n       This section prescribes a two-year statute of limitations\nfor:\n\n       Any other action or proceeding to recover damages\n       for injury to person or property which is founded on\n       negligent, intentional, or otherwise tortious conduct\n       or any other action or proceeding sounding in\n       trespass, including deceit or fraud, except an action or\n       proceeding subject to another limitation specified in\n       this subchapter.\n\n42 Pa. C.S.A. § 5524(7).\n\n\n                               13\n\f                          1. Accrual\n\n        Generally, the statute of limitations begins to run on a\nbreach of fiduciary duty claim when the trustee openly and\nunequivocally violates his duties. Philippi v. Philippe, 115\nU.S. 151, 157 (1885) (“[T]he statute of limitations will begin\nto run from the time such repudiation and claim came to the\nknowledge of the beneficiary.”); United States v. Rose, 346\nF.2d 985, 989-990 (3d Cir. 1965) (“The statute of limitations\nbegins to run against the trust beneficiary with respect to a\nsuit against the express trustee, if at all, when he knows the\ntrust has been repudiated or reasonably should have known\nit.”). Applying this reasoning, Scolio argues that the claims\nagainst him accrued on the date that the Seller’s invoices\nbecame overdue. The District Court rejected this rationale,\nand concluded that because of the continuing nature of the\nPACA trust, United Fruit’s failure to pay the Sellers’ invoices\namounted to a “continuing violation.”\n\n         We have previously addressed the contours of the\ncontinuing violations doctrine in Cowell v. Palmer Tp., 263\nF.3d 286, 293 (3d Cir. 2001). In Cowell, plaintiffs alleged\nthat a township violated their Fourteenth Amendment due\nprocess rights by imposing two liens on their properties. Id. at\n291. Although the statute of limitations had run since the\ninitial imposition of the liens, the plaintiffs argued that the\nliens amounted to a continuing violation until they were lifted\nor expunged. Id. at 293. We disagreed, explaining that “[t]he\nfocus of the continuing violations doctrine is on affirmative\nacts of the defendants.” Id. Adopting the view of the Fourth\nCircuit, we stated that “‘[a] continuing violation is occasioned\n\n                               14\n\fby continual unlawful acts, not continual ill effects from an\noriginal violation.’” Id. (quoting Ocean Acres Ltd. v. Dare\nCounty Bd. of Health, 707 F.2d 103, 106 (4th Cir.1983)).\n\n        We find that reasoning equally applicable to claims\narising from a trust relationship and conclude that once\nUnited Fruit and its officers failed to pay Sellers for the good\nreceived, Sellers were on notice that the trustees were in\nbreach of their fiduciary duties. Nor are we persuaded that\nthe unique nature of the PACA trust changes our analysis.\nWe recognize that the trust created by PACA exists until a\nseller is paid, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2), and “[p]articipants who\npreserve their rights to benefits . . . remain beneficiaries until\nthey are paid in full,” 7 C.F.R. 46.46(c)(2). However, when\nSellers are not suing to enforce the trust obligations or to\npreserve their shares of the trust res, but instead are suing the\ntrustee in tort for damages resulting from a breach of his\nfiduciary duties, we believe that the statute of limitations must\naccrue from the time that the trustee openly repudiates those\nduties.4\n\n       We likewise reject the contention that the claims\nagainst Scolio did not accrue until Sellers exhausted their\nremedies as against United Fruit. Under the District Court’s\ntheory, the statute of limitations for bringing PACA claims\nagainst Scolio did not accrue until December 29, 1999,\nbecause it was only then that the Sellers “were on notice that\n\n\n   4\n       We emphasize that the statute of limitations applies to\nactions against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n                               15\n\fUnited Fruits’s assets were insufficient to satisfy liability.”\nWeis-Buy, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 691. However, Sellers were on\nnotice that the United Fruit’s assets may not be sufficient\nwhen United Fruit first failed to pay its bills, and at the very\nleast, they were on notice that United Fruit might come up\nshort when it filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997.\n\n       Furthermore, because Sellers are suing Scolio in his\ntrustee capacity, it is irrelevant that they did not know whether\nUnited Fruit would be able to satisfy Sellers claims. In\nDonsco, Inc. v. Casper Corp., we explained that:\n\n               [a] corporate officer is individually liable\n       for the torts he personally commits and cannot\n       shield himself behind a corporation when he is an\n       actual participant in the tort. . . . His liability is in\n       no way dependent on a finding that [the\n       corporation] is inadequately capitalized, that the\n       corporation is a mere alter ego of [the officer],\n       that the corporate form is being used to perpetrate\n       a fraud, or that corporate formalities have not\n       been properly complied with. . . . The only\n       crucial predicate to [the officer]’s liability is his\n       participation in the wrongful acts.\n\n\n\n\n587 F.2d 602, 606 (3d Cir. 1978). As Scolio’s liability is\nwholly separate from the corporation’s liability, there is no\nreason to require Sellers to first bring claims against the\n\n\n                                  16\n\fcorporation before pursuing claims against Scolio.5 Sellers\ncould have brought suit simultaneously, as the parties did in\nGolman-Hayden Co., 217 F.3d at 349, or they simply could\nhave sued Scolio directly for breaching his duties.\n\n                            2. Tolling\n\n       In the alternative, the District Court reasoned that if the\nclaims accrued when the invoices became overdue, “then the\n\n\n   5\n        Admittedly, some courts have suggested that individual\nofficer liability is determinable only after the plaintiff has shown\nthat the corporate assets are insufficient to satisfy the obligation.\nFor instance, in Golman-Hayden Co., the Fifth Circuit\nexplained:\n        PACA liability attaches first to the licensed\n        commission merchant, dealer, or broker of perishable\n        agricultural commodities. If, however, the assets of\n        the licensed commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n        are insufficient to satisfy the PACA liability, then\n        others may be held secondarily liable if they had\n        some role in causing the corporate trustee to commit\n        the breach of trust.\n217 F.3d at 351 (footnotes omitted.). We do not read this\ninterpretation of PACA liability to mean that the injured party\ncannot seek relief from the individual who is secondarily liable\nuntil he has a judgment from the corporation that is primarily\nliable, rather that the seller may only be on notice of the breach\nof duty after first suing the corporation and discovering that the\nassets were not preserved.\n\n                                 17\n\flimitations period for bringing PACA claims against Mr.\nScolio would have been tolled while Plaintiffs first sought\nrelief from United Fruit. Under this scenario, the tolling\nperiod would have ended on December 29, 1999, when\nPlaintiffs learned that United Fruit’s assets were insufficient.”\nWeis-Buy, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 691. Again, we see no\njustification for tolling the statute of limitations.\n\n        “Equitable tolling functions to stop the statute of\nlimitations from running where the claim’s accrual date has\nalready passed.” Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran &\nBerman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1387 (3d Cir. 1994). Generally,\n“equitable tolling may be appropriate: (1) where the defendant\nhas actively misled the plaintiff respecting the plaintiff’s\ncause of action; (2) where the plaintiff in some extraordinary\nway has been prevented from asserting his or her rights; or (3)\nwhere the plaintiff has timely asserted his or her rights\nmistakenly in the wrong forum.” Id. None of these situations\nis present here, and Appellees have offered no justification for\ntolling the statute of limitations.\n\n       As explained infra, Sellers were not required to file\nsuit against United Fruit before pursuing an independent\naction against Scolio. When Sellers were not timely paid,\nthey were on notice that United Fruit, and the responsible\nparties inside United Fruit, had breached their trustee\nobligations. At this point the Sellers should have attempted to\ndiscover why payment was not forthcoming and who was\nresponsible. Instead, the Sellers sat on their hands, and even\nafter United Fruit filed for Bankruptcy protection in\nDecember 1997, they did not file suit. Sellers were under no\n\n                               18\n\fmisapprehension that their money was safe, nor could they\nassume that no one inside United Fruit was liable for their\nloss. Consequently, the statute of limitations was not tolled.\n\n                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        Weis-Buy’s last invoice came due on October 3, 1997,\nand Brigiotta’s last invoice came due on March 4, 1998.\nNeither seller filed suit until April 26, 2000, a date plainly\nlater than two years after any of their invoices had come due\nand more than two years after United Fruit originally filed for\nbankruptcy. Because we conclude that the statute of\nlimitations had run on these claims before the actions were\nfiled, we need not determine Scolio’s individual liability, nor\ndetermine whether the award of interest or attorneys’ fees\nwere appropriate.6 Instead, we remand to the District Court\nfor entry of judgment in favor of the Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n        While we have indicated our agreement that there are\ncircumstances under which officers may be held individually\nliable for breaching their fiduciary duties arising from a PACA\ntrust, we express no opinion about the correctness of the District\nCourt’s conclusion that Scolio’s activities were enough to\nestablish individual liability under the facts in this case.\n\n                               19\n\f",

On December 29, 1999, the Bankruptcy court\nauthorized a partial distribution of United Fruit’s assets to the\nSellers. Seeking recoupment of the balance of the money\nowed to them by United Fruit, Sellers then filed suit on April\n26, 2000, against August J. Scolio, Jr., an officer and\nshareholder of United Fruit, alleging that he had breached his\nfiduciary duty under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities\nAct of 1930, as amended, 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a-499s (“PACA”).\n\n  I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n                 HISTORY\n\n       United Fruit was started by Scolio’s father in 1914.\nScolio became involved with the company in 1949 and was a\npartner by 1960. In 1965, Scolio’s father died and Scolio\nbecame the sole proprietor of the business until 1986, when\nhe sold United Fruit to John Tarantino, Irvin Rovner, and\nLarry Altman. In 1988, the owners brought in Ralph Paglia to\nmanage the company. Scolio remained an employee of\nUnited Fruit, and was responsible for paying bills and\ncalculating the employees’ pay.\n\n\n\n\n1. Our recitation of the facts is drawn from the opinion of the\nDistrict Court. See Weis-Buy Servs. v. Paglia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 682, 685-87 (W.D. Pa. 2004)\n\n                                3\n\f       In 1994, Tarantino and Altman sold their shares,\nleaving ownership of United Fruit in the hands of Paglia\n(50%), Rover (25%), and Scolio (25%). According to Scolio,\nhe purchased shares for the benefit of Paglia who could not\nafford to buy all the shares that he wanted. Although Scolio\nclaims that he eventually intended to sell his interest to Paglia,\nhe never did so, and thus Scolio remained a shareholder at the\ntime of United Fruit’s bankruptcy.\n\n       Not only was Scolio a shareholder and employee of\nUnited Fruit, but company policy required his and Paglia’s\nsignature for disbursement of United Fruit checks. To assist\nhim in this endeavor, Scolio had a signature stamp created to\nuse when issuing United Fruit’s checks.\n\n         In June 1997, Paglia asked Scolio to retire, but\nencouraged him to remain active in the directorship of the\ncompany. Scolio ceased working for United Fruit, but\nretained his stake in the company, his position as officer, and\nhis title as vice-president. Scolio also remained a signatory on\nUnited Fruit’s bank accounts and United Fruit continued to\nuse Scolio’s signature stamp after his retirement.\nFurthermore, Scolio acted as a guarantor on transactions\nbetween United Fruit and Dollar Bank Leasing and possibly\nFirst Western Bank.\n\n       Soon after Scolio retired, United Fruit began doing\nbusiness with Weis-Buy and Brigiotta’s. From July 9, 1997\nthrough September 23, 1997, Weis-Buy sent five shipments of\nproduce to United Fruit, with payment on each shipment due\nwithin ten days. October 3, 1997 was the latest date on which\n\n                                4\n\fpayment was due for any of the Weis-Buy invoices.\nBrigiotta’s provided produce in numerous shipments to\nUnited Fruit from August 23, 1997 through February 22,\n1998. Again, payments were due within ten days of the date\nof each invoice, and March 4, 1998 was the latest date on\nwhich payment was due on any of the Brigiotta’s invoices.\nNeither Seller received any payment for the produce it\nprovided.\n\n       United Fruit filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code on December 9, 1997. The company\nceased operations in March 1998. Sellers’ claims were\ndetermined to be qualified valid PACA claims by the\nBankruptcy Court and each received a partial distribution\nfrom United Fruit’s remaining assets.\n\n        Seeking the rest of the money owed to them, Sellers\nfiled suit against Scolio in the United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Pennsylvania on April 26, 2000. In\ntheir complaint, Sellers alleged that Scolio breached his\nfiduciary duty owed to them under PACA. A bench trial was\nheld on March 19, 2003, and the District Court found Scolio\nliable and ordered judgment in favor of the Sellers. The\nDistrict Court also awarded interest and attorneys’ fees.\nScolio timely appealed.\n\n  II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fpursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5)(i)2 and 28 U.S.C. § 1367.\nWe have jurisdiction over the final decision of the District\nCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We exercise plenary review of the District Court’s\nrefusal to dismiss the case on statute of limitations grounds.\nLake v.

ANALYSIS\n\n        Scolio raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues\nthat the District Court erred when it failed to dismiss the case\non statute of limitations grounds. Second, he claims that the\nDistrict Court erred in finding him personally liable. Finally,\nScolio challenges the District Court’s award of attorneys’ fees\nand interest. Because we conclude that Sellers’ claims were\nnot timely, we do not address Scolio’s other arguments.\n\n\n   2\n        “The several district courts of the United States are\nvested with jurisdiction specifically to entertain (i) actions by\ntrust beneficiaries to enforce payment from the trust, and (ii)\nactions by the Secretary to prevent and restrain dissipation of the\ntrust.”\n\n7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5).\n\n\n                                6\n\f                          A. PACA\n\n    This Court has had few opportunities to examine\nPACA, thus we begin by examining the history and purpose\nof the statute. Congress enacted PACA in 1930 to deter\nunfair business practices and promote financial responsibility\nin the perishable agricultural goods market. Sunkist Growers\nv.

Rep. No.\n84-1196 (1955), reprinted in 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3701,\n3701).\n\n       In 1984 Congress amended PACA to allow for a non-\nsegregated floating trust for the protection of producers and\ngrowers. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543 (1983), reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Congress recognized that these\nproducers and growers tend to be small businesses in a high\ncost/high risk industry. Id. They generally have capital tied\nup in land and machinery and their survival depends on\ntimely returns on the sale of their products. Id. Congress\nexplained:\n\n           Many commission merchants, dealers, or\n      brokers, in the normal course of their business\n\n                              7\n\ftransactions, operate on bank loans secured by the\ninventories, proceeds or assigned receivables\nfrom sales of perishable agricultural commodities,\ngiving the lender a secured position in the case of\ninsolvency. Under present law, sellers of fresh\nfruits and vegetables are unsecured creditors and\nreceive little protection in any suit for recovery of\ndamages where a buyer has failed to make\npayment as required by the contract.\n\n       This legislation would provide a remedy\nby impressing a trust in favor of the unpaid seller\nor supplier on the inventories of commodities and\nproducts derived therefrom and on the proceeds\nof sale of such commodities and products in the\nhands of the commission merchant, dealer or\nbroker in the same manner that has been provided\nby ‘trust’ amendments to the Packers and\nStockyards Act adopted in 1976. The trust\nprovisions of that act have operated very\nsuccessfully without imposing a regulatory\nburden on the industry.\n\n        The trust impression by section 5(c)(2) of\nthis act is made up of a firm's commodity related\nliquid assets, and is a nonsegregated ‘floating\ntrust’, which permits the commingling of trust\nassets. In the view of the committee it provides\nthe protection needed by the trust beneficiaries\nwithout creating an undue hardship to any person.\n\n\n                         8\n\f               The committee believes that the statutory\n       trust requirements will not be a burden to the\n       lending institutions. They will be known to and\n       considered by prospective lenders in extending\n       credit.

Applying this reasoning, Scolio argues that the claims\nagainst him accrued on the date that the Seller’s invoices\nbecame overdue. The District Court rejected this rationale,\nand concluded that because of the continuing nature of the\nPACA trust, United Fruit’s failure to pay the Sellers’ invoices\namounted to a “continuing violation.”\n\n         We have previously addressed the contours of the\ncontinuing violations doctrine in Cowell v. Palmer Tp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774709\"><a href=\"/opinion/774709/eileen-cowell-richard-cowell-sylvester-pany-eastgate-land-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (3d Cir. 2001). In Cowell, plaintiffs alleged\nthat a township violated their Fourteenth Amendment due\nprocess rights by imposing two liens on their properties. Id. at\n291. Although the statute of limitations had run since the\ninitial imposition of the liens, the plaintiffs argued that the\nliens amounted to a continuing violation until they were lifted\nor expunged. Id. at 293. We disagreed, explaining that “[t]he\nfocus of the continuing violations doctrine is on affirmative\nacts of the defendants.” Id. Adopting the view of the Fourth\nCircuit, we stated that “‘[a] continuing violation is occasioned\n\n                               14\n\fby continual unlawful acts, not continual ill effects from an\noriginal violation.’” Id. (quoting Ocean Acres Ltd. v. Dare\nCounty Bd. of Health, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418175\"><a href=\"/opinion/418175/ocean-acres-limited-partnership-a-limited-partnership-organized-under-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (4th Cir.1983)).\n\n        We find that reasoning equally applicable to claims\narising from a trust relationship and conclude that once\nUnited Fruit and its officers failed to pay Sellers for the good\nreceived, Sellers were on notice that the trustees were in\nbreach of their fiduciary duties. Nor are we persuaded that\nthe unique nature of the PACA trust changes our analysis.\nWe recognize that the trust created by PACA exists until a\nseller is paid, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2), and “[p]articipants who\npreserve their rights to benefits . . . remain beneficiaries until\nthey are paid in full,” 7 C.F.R. 46.46(c)(2). However, when\nSellers are not suing to enforce the trust obligations or to\npreserve their shares of the trust res, but instead are suing the\ntrustee in tort for damages resulting from a breach of his\nfiduciary duties, we believe that the statute of limitations must\naccrue from the time that the trustee openly repudiates those\nduties.4\n\n       We likewise reject the contention that the claims\nagainst Scolio did not accrue until Sellers exhausted their\nremedies as against United Fruit. Under the District Court’s\ntheory, the statute of limitations for bringing PACA claims\nagainst Scolio did not accrue until December 29, 1999,\nbecause it was only then that the Sellers “were on notice that\n\n\n   4\n       We emphasize that the statute of limitations applies to\nactions against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n                               15\n\fUnited Fruits’s assets were insufficient to satisfy liability.”\nWeis-Buy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

However, Sellers were on\nnotice that the United Fruit’s assets may not be sufficient\nwhen United Fruit first failed to pay its bills, and at the very\nleast, they were on notice that United Fruit might come up\nshort when it filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997.\n\n       Furthermore, because Sellers are suing Scolio in his\ntrustee capacity, it is irrelevant that they did not know whether\nUnited Fruit would be able to satisfy Sellers claims. In\nDonsco, Inc. v. Casper Corp., we explained that:\n\n               [a] corporate officer is individually liable\n       for the torts he personally commits and cannot\n       shield himself behind a corporation when he is an\n       actual participant in the tort. . . . His liability is in\n       no way dependent on a finding that [the\n       corporation] is inadequately capitalized, that the\n       corporation is a mere alter ego of [the officer],\n       that the corporate form is being used to perpetrate\n       a fraud, or that corporate formalities have not\n       been properly complied with. . . . The only\n       crucial predicate to [the officer]’s liability is his\n       participation in the wrongful acts.\n\n\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361059\"><a href=\"/opinion/361059/donsco-inc-trading-as-john-wright-inc-a-pennsylvania-corporation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (3d Cir. 1978). As Scolio’s liability is\nwholly separate from the corporation’s liability, there is no\nreason to require Sellers to first bring claims against the\n\n\n                                  16\n\fcorporation before pursuing claims against Scolio.5 Sellers\ncould have brought suit simultaneously, as the parties did in\nGolman-Hayden Co., 217 F.3d at 349, or they simply could\nhave sued Scolio directly for breaching his duties.\n\n                            2. Tolling\n\n       In the alternative, the District Court reasoned that if the\nclaims accrued when the invoices became overdue, “then the\n\n\n   5\n        Admittedly, some courts have suggested that individual\nofficer liability is determinable only after the plaintiff has shown\nthat the corporate assets are insufficient to satisfy the obligation.\nFor instance, in Golman-Hayden Co., the Fifth Circuit\nexplained:\n        PACA liability attaches first to the licensed\n        commission merchant, dealer, or broker of perishable\n        agricultural commodities. If, however, the assets of\n        the licensed commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n        are insufficient to satisfy the PACA liability, then\n        others may be held secondarily liable if they had\n        some role in causing the corporate trustee to commit\n        the breach of trust.\n217 F.3d at 351 (footnotes omitted.). We do not read this\ninterpretation of PACA liability to mean that the injured party\ncannot seek relief from the individual who is secondarily liable\nuntil he has a judgment from the corporation that is primarily\nliable, rather that the seller may only be on notice of the breach\nof duty after first suing the corporation and discovering that the\nassets were not preserved.\n\n                                 17\n\flimitations period for bringing PACA claims against Mr.\nScolio would have been tolled while Plaintiffs first sought\nrelief from United Fruit. Under this scenario, the tolling\nperiod would have ended on December 29, 1999, when\nPlaintiffs learned that United Fruit’s assets were insufficient.”\nWeis-Buy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 691. Again, we see no\njustification for tolling the statute of limitations.\n\n        “Equitable tolling functions to stop the statute of\nlimitations from running where the claim’s accrual date has\nalready passed.” Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran &\nBerman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681308\"><a href=\"/opinion/681308/sherry-j-oshiver-v-levin-fishbein-sedran-berman/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1387 (3d Cir. 1994). Generally,\n“equitable tolling may be appropriate: (1) where the defendant\nhas actively misled the plaintiff respecting the plaintiff’s\ncause of action; (2) where the plaintiff in some extraordinary\nway has been prevented from asserting his or her rights; or (3)\nwhere the plaintiff has timely asserted his or her rights\nmistakenly in the wrong forum.” Id. None of these situations\nis present here, and Appellees have offered no justification for\ntolling the statute of limitations.\n\n       As explained infra, Sellers were not required to file\nsuit against United Fruit before pursuing an independent\naction against Scolio. When Sellers were not timely paid,\nthey were on notice that United Fruit, and the responsible\nparties inside United Fruit, had breached their trustee\nobligations. At this point the Sellers should have attempted to\ndiscover why payment was not forthcoming and who was\nresponsible. Instead, the Sellers sat on their hands, and even\nafter United Fruit filed for Bankruptcy protection in\nDecember 1997, they did not file suit. Sellers were under no\n\n                               18\n\fmisapprehension that their money was safe, nor could they\nassume that no one inside United Fruit was liable for their\nloss. Consequently, the statute of limitations was not tolled.\n\n                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        Weis-Buy’s last invoice came due on October 3, 1997,\nand Brigiotta’s last invoice came due on March 4, 1998.\nNeither seller filed suit until April 26, 2000, a date plainly\nlater than two years after any of their invoices had come due\nand more than two years after United Fruit originally filed for\nbankruptcy. Because we conclude that the statute of\nlimitations had run on these claims before the actions were\nfiled, we need not determine Scolio’s individual liability, nor\ndetermine whether the award of interest or attorneys’ fees\nwere appropriate.6 Instead, we remand to the District Court\nfor entry of judgment in favor of the Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n        While we have indicated our agreement that there are\ncircumstances under which officers may be held individually\nliable for breaching their fiduciary duties arising from a PACA\ntrust, we express no opinion about the correctness of the District\nCourt’s conclusion that Scolio’s activities were enough to\nestablish individual liability under the facts in this case.\n\n                               19\n\f</pre>",
