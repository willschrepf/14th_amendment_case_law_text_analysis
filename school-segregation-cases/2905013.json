Williams, a Pennsylvania state prisoner, filed pro se an action under 42\n\n\n                                           1\n\fU.S.C. § 1983 against various officials and employees of the Pennsylvania Department of\n\nCorrections alleging violation of his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights in connection with a disciplinary hearing. On June 8, 2006, Williams was given a\n\nmisconduct report for “Engaging in Sexual Acts.” Following a disciplinary hearing,\n\nWilliams was found guilty of the charged misconduct and sanctioned to 90 days in\n\ndisciplinary custody. Williams unsuccessfully appealed the Hearing Examiner’s decision\n\nthrough all levels of review before filing the instant action for compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages.\n\n       Williams claimed that he was unlawfully incarcerated because of the disciplinary\n\nsanction, placing him in the Restricted Housing Unit for 90 days. In addition, Williams\n\nalleged that Defendants “conspired to unlawfully incarcerate him” and deny him due\n\nprocess and his equal protection rights. The District Court dismissed Williams’ complaint\n\nas frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Williams then filed a motion for\n\nleave to file an amended complaint in which he alleged a violation of his rights by the\n\n“‘customs or ‘policy’ promulgated by the Department of Corrections” and a denial of due\n\nprocess during his disciplinary hearing because he was not represented and was denied\n\nthe opportunity to call witnesses. The District Court denied Williams’ motion. He timely\n\nappealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We may summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s judgment if the appeal presents no substantial question. 3d Cir. LAR\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.\n\n       Williams’ claim that he was denied due process and unlawfully placed in\n\ndisciplinary housing lacks legal merit. “Discipline by prison officials in response to a\n\nwide range of misconduct falls within the expected parameters of the sentence imposed.”\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485 (1995). Under Sandin, prison disciplinary\n\nsegregation will implicate a protectable liberty interest only if it dramatically departs, in\n\nlength of time or otherwise, from basic prison conditions. See, e.g., Smith v. Mensinger,\n\n293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months in disciplinary segregation is insufficient\n\nto trigger a due process violation); Griffin v. Vaughan, 112 F.3d 703, 706-08 (3d Cir.\n\n1997) (fifteen months in administrative custody is insufficient to trigger a due process\n\nviolation). The District Court reasoned that the sanction of 90 days in disciplinary\n\nsegregation was not an atypical or significant deprivation that would give rise to a liberty\n\ninterest under Sandin. We agree. This same thinking undermines the specific allegations\n\nmade by Williams in his amended complaint. The lack of representation and inability to\n\ncall witnesses, as well as any other alleged procedural defects, lack legal significance in\n\nthe absence of any protectable interest. See Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487.\n\n       Williams also claimed a conspiracy by the Defendants to unlawfully punish him by\n\ncharging him with false misconduct. The District Court correctly rejected Williams’\n\nclaims, reasoning that the allegations were vague and conclusory and did not present a\n\ncognizable § 1983 conspiracy claim. See Young v. Kann, 926 F.2d 1396, 1405 n.16 (3d\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fCir. 1991) (conspiracy claims based on plaintiff’s subjective suspicions and unsupported\n\nspeculation were properly dismissed at screening).\n\n        With respect to the equal protection claim that he was discriminated against, the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that Williams failed to allege that Defendants engaged\n\nin intentional or purposeful discrimination or that he was treated differently than similarly\n\nsituated individuals on the basis of his race. See Wilson v. Schillinger, 761 F.2d 921, 929\n\n(3d Cir. 1985). Williams claimed only that his civil rights were violated by defendants of\n\nthe opposite race, but that is insufficient to state an equal protection claim. See id.\n\n(intentional or purposeful discrimination is a necessary element of an equal protection\n\nviolation).\n\n        For the foregoing reason, we will summarily affirm. See I.O.P. 10.6. The motion\n\nfor appointment of counsel is denied. See Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153-54 (3d Cir.\n\n1993)\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
