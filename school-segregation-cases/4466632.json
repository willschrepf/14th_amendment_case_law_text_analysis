The district court erred in granting Murphy’s motion for\nsummary judgment, which allows Murphy to satisfy its\nobligation to drill an offset well simply by drilling a well\nanywhere on the Herbst Leases.\n\n2.    The district court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s\nfees on appeal because (a) the district court had no authority to\naward fees and (b) the award was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                               vii\n\f                       SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      An offset well is a “well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the\n\ndrainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a well is being\n\ndrilled or is already in production.” Williams & Meyers’ Manual of Oil and\n\nGas Terms, p. 718 (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\nleases (“Leases”) provides that, if a well is drilled on adjacent lands and\n\nwithin 467 feet of the leased premises, the lessee must either drill an offset\n\nwell, release sufficient acreage adjacent to the draining well to allow the\n\nLessor to drill an offset well, or pay compensatory royalty. Murphy drilled\n\na well on the Leases over 2,100 feet from the draining well and contends it\n\nis an “offset well” under Paragraph 25. Such a well does not qualify as an\n\noffset well under Paragraph 25.\n\n      Murphy argues that a well drilled anywhere on the leased premises\n\nsatisfies its obligation under Paragraph 25, as long as the well is completed\n\nin the same formation as the draining well. This argument deprives the\n\nword “offset” of any meaning and ignores the plain language and intent of\n\nParagraph 25, which is to protect the leased premises from drainage.\n\n      Murphy also argues that the well on the adjacent land is not in fact\n\ndraining the leased premises. There is no evidence in the record to support\n\n                                      1\n\fthat contention.   More to the point, Paragraph 25 does not require the\n\nLessor to prove that the well is draining the leased premises. The very\n\npurpose of Paragraph 25 is to eliminate the need for that proof.\n\n      The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorneys’ fees on appeal,\n\nbased on its counterclaim for declaratory judgment. A request for\n\ndeclaratory judgment “tacked onto” a breach of contract claim cannot be a\n\nbasis for a fee award. MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292\n\nS.W.3d 660, 669-70 (Tex. 2009).\n\n                                  ARGUMENT\n\nI.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Murphy.\n      (Issue One)\n\n      The district court erred in holding that Murphy’s drilling of a well\n\nmore than 2,100 feet from a well on adjacent property satisfies Murphy’s\n\nobligation to drill an offset well under its Leases with the Herbsts.\n\n      A.    Murphy’s interpretation of Paragraph 25 of the Leases renders\n            the term “offset” meaningless.\n\n      Murphy asserts (at 4) that the Leases “give[] the operator discretion\n\nover when and where to drill” and, therefore, Murphy has the discretion to\n\nlocate an offset well anywhere on the leased premises. Nothing in the\n\nLeases says this. Murphy’s interpretation of the Leases to allow the lessee\n\n                                       2\n\fto locate the offset well anywhere on the leased premises renders the word\n\n“offset” a meaningless, redundant term. As the Herbsts pointed out in\n\ntheir initial brief (at 14), omit the word “offset” from Paragraph 25 and\n\nMurphy’s interpretation would be reasonable. Murphy fails to address\n\neither this point or the basic rule of construction that all words in the\n\nLeases are to be given effect. See State Farm Lloyds v. Gulley, 399 S.W.3d 242,\n\n247 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012, pet. denied) (Courts should “give effect\n\nto all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered\n\nmeaningless.”); Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Silva, 75 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2001, pet. denied) (Courts should “give meaning to\n\nevery sentence, clause and word” in a contract.).\n\n      The terms “well” and “offset well” should not be interpreted to mean\n\nthe same thing.     Interpreting two different terms “to have the same\n\nmeaning . . . would render one or the other term meaningless or\n\nredundant.” DaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160, 185\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2012, no pet.).\n\n      The Leases use the term “well” in many other provisions, including\n\nthe two paragraphs immediately preceding Paragraph 25. See, e.g., ¶¶ 3, 6,\n\n7, 14, 18, 23, 24 (SCR 150 – 170). The term “offset well” appears only in\n                                      3\n\fParagraph 25. “‘When a contract uses different language in proximate and\n\nsimilar provisions, we commonly … assume that the parties’ use of\n\ndifferent language was intended to convey different meanings.’”            Id.\n\n(citation omitted). See also Cmty Improvement Ass’n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc.\n\nv. Beckham, No. 07-03-00036-CV, 2004 WL 2000666 at *4 (Tex. App.—\n\nAmarillo 2004, no pet.) (mem. op.) (declining to interpret different words to\n\nhave the same meaning).        The Court should reject the trial court’s\n\nacceptance of Murphy’s argument that any “well” is an “offset well.”\n\n      B.    Murphy’s attempts to justify giving no meaning to the term\n            “offset” violate basic rules of contract construction.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 10) that the word “such” in Paragraph 25 justifies\n\nnot giving any meaning to the term “offset.” Murphy asserts that, because\n\nthe word “such” appears before the word “offset,” the phrase “such offset\n\nwell” must be an “internal cross-reference to ‘drilling operations on the\n\nleased acreage.’” Murphy then makes the further leap to say that this\n\n“internal cross-reference” must mean that any drilling operations anywhere\n\non the Leases satisfies the duty to drill an offset well.     This contorted\n\nreading of Paragraph 25 is contrary to the rules of construction cited above\n\nand is not reasonable. Nothing in the word “such” indicates an intent to\n\n\n                                      4\n\frender the word “offset” meaningless.        The word “such” is simply a\n\nreference to the “offset well” that must be drilled.\n\n      In another attempt to justify ignoring the term “offset,” Murphy\n\nargues (at 10) that drilling to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n\nsatisfies the “ordinary and industry” meaning of the term “offset” because\n\ndrilling a well to that depth serves as a “counterbalance” or a “[s]et off as\n\nan equivalent against.” The depth requirement in the Leases, however, is\n\nan additional vertical requirement beyond the horizontal offsetting distance\n\nrequirement. Drilling a well to the same vertical depth as the triggering\n\nwell but locating that well 2,100 feet or several miles away could not\n\npossibly “offset” the triggering well. Moreover, the duty to drill to this\n\nvertical depth still exists if one deletes the word “offset” from Paragraph\n\n25. Therefore, this reading of Paragraph 25 continues to render the term\n\n“offset” meaningless.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 9) that Paragraph 25(3), which gives Murphy the\n\noption to release acreage instead of drilling, supports Murphy’s claim that\n\nit can drill the offset well anywhere it wants because Paragraph 25(3) does\n\nnot define the acreage that must be released. Paragraph 25(3) supports the\n\nHerbsts’ construction of the offset requirement, not Murphy’s. Paragraph\n                                       5\n\f25(3) specifies that the acreage released must be “sufficient to constitute a\n\nspacing unit equivalent in size to the spacing unit that would be allocated\n\nunder this lease to such well or wells on the adjacent lands.” SCR 155, 166\n\n(emphasis added). “Adjacent” means “[c]lose to,” “lying near,” “[n]ext to”\n\nor “adjoining.” THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY at 21 (5th ed. 2011).\n\nParagraph 25(3) plainly requires Murphy to release acreage “next to” the\n\nlands where the triggering well is located. The provision also requires the\n\nacreage to be in a sufficient amount to allow the Herbsts or their new lessee\n\nto drill a well in compliance with Railroad Commission (“RRC”) spacing\n\nrules. Murphy’s suggestion that it could release acreage on the far side of\n\nthe leased premises and satisfy this provision only highlights the\n\nunreasonableness of its interpretation.\n\n      C.    The Herbsts are not rewriting the Leases but are, instead,\n            giving Paragraph 25 its only reasonable, utilitarian result.\n\n      The Herbsts are not, as Murphy alleges (at 11), trying to rewrite the\n\nLeases or add terms that are not there. Instead, the Herbsts give meaning\n\nto all of the words that are there.\n\n      Murphy asserts (at 9) that the Leases could have included a specific\n\ndistance limitation and the fact that they do not must mean that Murphy\n\n\n                                      6\n\fcan locate the well anywhere on the leased premises. The absence of a\n\nspecific distance limitation is reasonable and readily explained.           By\n\navoiding a specific distance limitation, the Leases properly grant the lessee\n\nsome flexibility in locating the offset well.\n\n      The Herbsts’ recognition that Murphy has some flexibility in locating\n\nthe offset well does not, as Murphy claims (at 9), constitute the creation of a\n\n“per se unreasonable” “moving-target distance.”        On the contrary, this\n\nconcession recognizes the practicalities inherent in locating a well. There\n\ncould be a pipeline or a habitable structure or some other obstacle situated\n\nnext to the lease line. Paragraph 7 of the Leases prohibits drilling a well\n\n“nearer than 200 feet to the house or barn now on said land” without the\n\nlandowner’s consent. SCR 152, 163. These potential circumstances could\n\nimpact how closely Murphy would be able to locate the well to the lease\n\nline. Giving the lessee “an inch” of flexibility to address potential obstacles\n\nto drilling, however, does not equate to giving the lessee permission to take\n\n“a mile.” That is precisely the unreasonable position Murphy takes here.\n\nUnder Murphy’s reasoning, a lessee with these provisions on a 25,000 acre\n\nlease could locate an offset well many miles from the well triggering the\n\nduty to offset. That makes no sense.\n                                         7\n\f     Murphy further argues (at 11-12) that imposing any range of\n\ndistances for an offset well equates to implying terms the parties did not\n\nagree to. On the contrary, interpreting Paragraph 25 to require Murphy to\n\nplace the well in close proximity to the triggering well is not rewriting the\n\nLeases: it is giving meaning to the term “offset” and fulfilling the purposes\n\nof Paragraph 25 to protect against any presumed drainage.\n\n     Courts do not rewrite contracts but they also do not interpret them in\n\na way that renders them “unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.”\n\nSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v. Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273, 287 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2013, no pet.) (quoting Frost Nat. Bank v. L&F Distributors, Ltd., 165 S.W.3d\n\n310, 312 (Tex. 2005)).    Courts “construe contracts ‘from a utilitarian\n\nstandpoint bearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be\n\nserved.’” Id. The only reasonable, utilitarian interpretation of Paragraph\n\n25 is to require an offset well to be close to the well it is supposed to\n\n“offset.” How close will depend on the particular circumstances on the\n\nleased premises. But drilling a well over 2,100 feet – or 20 miles – from the\n\ntriggering well is not reasonable and would not serve the issues addressed\n\nin Paragraph 25. Murphy’s claims (at 3-4) that it could make more money\n\nby drilling the well where it did serves none of the objectives of Paragraph\n                                      8\n\f25.   The Herbsts’ construction of Paragraph 25 “is the only plausible\n\nconstruction.” Springer Ranch, 421 S.W.3d at 286.\n\n      The issue in this case is not how close to the adjacent well Murphy’s\n\noffset well must be located. The issue is whether, by drilling a well over\n\n2,100 feet from the adjacent well, Murphy satisfied its obligations under\n\nParagraph 25. No reasonable construction of Paragraph 25 would support\n\nMurphy’s argument that its well, more than 2,100 feet away, is an “offset\n\nwell” under Paragraph 25.\n\n      Murphy cites (at 9) Americo Life, Inc. v. Myer, 440 S.W.3d 18, 24-25\n\n(Tex. 2014), for the proposition that courts “think [the parties to a contract]\n\nmeant not only what they said but also what they did not say.”            That\n\nnotion supports the Herbsts, not Murphy. What the parties said here was\n\nthat a well Murphy drilled to comply with Paragraph 25 had to be an\n\n“offset well.” The parties did not say that Murphy could drill a “well”\n\nanywhere it chose and still comply with Paragraph 25.\n\n      D.    Murphy’s expert affidavit, on which it based its motion for\n            summary judgment, does not support the trial court’s\n            decision.\n\n      In the trial court, Murphy contended that extrinsic testimony from its\n\nexpert was necessary support for its summary judgment motion. (“Extrinsic\n\n                                       9\n\fevidence is admissible and necessary to explain the meaning of ‘off-set well’\n\nas used in Paragraph 25 of the Leases.” (Emphasis added)). SCR 123. In\n\ntheir initial brief, the Herbsts explained (at 28-34) the many flaws in the\n\naffidavit from Murphy’s expert, whose opinion was based on a misreading\n\nof RRC rules, orders, and form and his own ipse dixit. The Herbsts also set\n\nout the law that opinion testimony generally raises only a question of fact.\n\nSee Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 338 (Tex. 1998).\n\n       Murphy makes no attempt in its brief to challenge the Herbsts’\n\nbriefing on either the pervasive defects in Murphy’s expert affidavit or the\n\nlaw that such expert testimony can do no more than raise a fact issue.\n\nInstead, in an about-face, Murphy now denies the need for the expert\n\ntestimony it relied on to persuade the trial court to rule in its favor. 1 See Br.\n\nat 15 (asserting Murphy’s expert affidavit “is not necessary”).\n\n       Although Murphy now distances itself from its expert, Murphy still\n\ncites its expert’s affidavit for the claim that “there is little to no drainage” in\n\n\n\n1\n   On page 15 of its brief, Murphy suggests the trial court did not rely on Murphy’s expert\naffidavit, stating that the “trial court’s judgment reflects that it construed the Leases as\nunambiguous and without reference to the Murphy’s expert affidavit.” While the trial court’s\njudgment does not mention Murphy’s expert affidavit, it does not reject it either. Moreover, the\ntrial court granted Murphy’s motion, which relied heavily on the affidavit as the centerpiece of\nits argument. Murphy’s suggestion that the trial court ruled for it without regard to Murphy’s\nkey argument is without any support in the record.\n                                              10\n\fthe Eagle Ford Shale and therefore “no reason to drill a well near the lease\n\nline.” See Br. at 11 (citing SCR 177). Murphy suggests (at 11) that it is\n\nproper to rely on its expert for this claim so that it can show the Herbsts’\n\n“profound misunderstanding of the characteristics of horizontal shale wells\n\nand the commercial context of the Leases.”\n\n      Murphy’s expert does not actually say there is “little to no drainage,”\n\nand does not address drainage specific to the oil and gas under the leased\n\npremises at all.   No actual testing was ever conducted with respect to\n\ndrainage of these leased premises. He says that the RRC “assigned lease\n\nline spacing rules that reflect” that “a relatively modest amount of reservoir\n\nis drained by each horizontal well.” SCR 177. Murphy’s expert further\n\nstates that “[e]arly indications” of recent “pilot programs” are that wells\n\nmay be located “as close as 225 feet” without drainage. SCR 177.\n\n      Murphy’s reliance on these statements to show the “commercial\n\ncontext” of the Leases is mistaken. The relevant commercial context for the\n\nLeases is the commercial context “in which the contract was negotiated.”\n\nSee Kachina Pipeline Co. v. Lillis, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 13,0596, 2015 WL\n\n5889109 at *3 (Tex. October 9, 2015) (stating court may consider “the\n\ncommercial or other setting in which the contract was negotiated”). These\n                                      11\n\fstatements by Murphy’s expert, made in 2014, have nothing to do with the\n\ncommercial context at the time the Leases were negotiated in 2009.\n\nMurphy’s expert speaks to what he claims is known about the Eagle Ford\n\nfield as of 2014, not what was known in 2009, when the Leases were signed.\n\n      The commercial context when the parties executed these Leases in\n\n2009 was exactly what Paragraph 25 indicates it was – a concern that\n\ndrainage might occur if wells were drilled on neighboring tracts within 467\n\nfeet of the lease line. The RRC did not have special “lease line spacing\n\nrules” for the Eagle Ford in 2009 but instead, had the spacing rule that\n\nformed the basis for the offset well drilling requirement in the Leases – i.e.,\n\n467 feet. Those RRC rules, which reduced from the standard 467 feet to 330\n\nfeet the well spacing distance from the lease line – a spacing requirement\n\ndesigned to protect against drainage – were not adopted until more than a\n\nyear later, in November of 2010. Even then, the RRC adopted them only as\n\ntemporary rules until the RRC could acquire more information about the\n\nEagle Ford field. SCR 88-92. The RRC did not make these spacing rules\n\npermanent until almost two years later, in 2012. SCR 93-97. The pilot\n\nprojects that Murphy’s expert also relies on for his statements regarding\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\fthe risk of drainage in the Eagle Ford similarly did not exist in 2009 when\n\nthe Leases were executed.\n\n      Finally, Murphy misses the point that the purpose of Paragraph 25\n\nwas to eliminate any requirement that the Lessor prove drainage from the\n\nadjacent well in order to trigger the Lessee’s obligation to drill an offset\n\nwell. The Lessee’s obligations under Paragraph 25 were triggered by the\n\ndrilling of a well within 467 feet of the lease line. Murphy then had the\n\noption to either drill an offset well, release sufficient acreage adjacent to the\n\ndraining well to allow an offset well to be drilled, or pay compensatory\n\nroyalty. The parties agreed that no proof of actual drainage by the adjacent\n\nwell was necessary to trigger the Lessee’s obligations.\n\n      E.    Industry understanding supports the Herbsts’ interpretation\n            of Paragraph 25.\n\n      On page 16 of its brief, Murphy suggests the Herbsts opposed this\n\nCourt’s    consideration   of   industry    understanding     regarding    what\n\nconstitutes an offset well.      Not so.     The Herbsts’ briefing properly\n\nacknowledged that courts use the generally accepted meaning that a term\n\nhas been given in the oil and gas industry, if it is consistent with the plain\n\nlanguage of the lease. See Br. at 23-24.\n\n\n                                       13\n\f      It    is    Murphy,    not   the   Herbsts,   that   is   ignoring   industry\n\nunderstanding of what an “offset well” is. Murphy’s argument (at 11) that\n\nthere is no need for the well to be close to the triggering well because no\n\ndrainage is, in fact, occurring, is an artful way of saying that the offset well\n\nprovisions in the Leases were never intended to protect against the risk of\n\ndrainage.        In fact, Murphy’s expert said precisely that in his affidavit:\n\n“Plaintiffs’ contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to\n\nprotect their acreage from drainage is not correct.” SCR 177.\n\n      This position cannot be squared with the industry understanding of\n\nthe term “offset well.” Williams & Meyers’ Manual of Oil and Gas Terms, p.\n\n718 (1994 ed.), defines an offset well as a “well drilled on one tract of land\n\nto prevent the drainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a\n\nwell is being drilled or is already in production.” (Emphasis added.) The\n\nother dictionary definitions provided to the trial court and to this Court in\n\nthe Herbst’ initial brief (at 24-25) also make plain that protection from\n\ndrainage is the principal purpose of an offset well.\n\n      As the Herbsts’ expert Gregg Robertson correctly states:\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f     [T]he inclusion of a provision such as the one in paragraph 25\n     requiring remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on\n     offset acreage has only one, sole purpose – to prevent,\n     compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises\n     by the offending well. Common sense precludes any other\n     construction.\n\nSCR 240.\n\n     If Murphy believed no drainage was possible in the Eagle Ford,\n\nMurphy should not have accepted leases with these offset provisions. It\n\nshould not now be allowed to deprive the Herbsts of the benefit of their\n\nbargain based on its claim that no drainage is actually occurring. Allowing\n\nthis argument to prevail undermines the key purpose of Paragraph 25,\n\nwhich was designed to relieve the lessors of the difficult and expensive\n\nburden of proving drainage. See Herbsts’ Initial Br. at 21-23 (discussing\n\ndifficulties lessors experienced in proving drainage occurred).\n\n     F.    Resort to expert testimony on understanding in the industry\n           is unnecessary, and Murphy’s expert does not credibly\n           express that understanding.\n\n     Although Murphy contends in its brief that it does not need its expert\n\naffidavit, it alternatively contends that it would be proper to consider its\n\nexpert’s opinions because extrinsic evidence is proper here.       Industry\n\n\n                                     15\n\funderstanding can be determined without resort to Murphy’s expert\n\naffidavit, and, as the definitions discussed above and in the Herbsts’ initial\n\nbrief conclusively show, that industry understanding rejects Murphy’s\n\nposition.\n\n      The word “offset” has a plain dictionary meaning and expert\n\ntestimony cannot be used to contradict that meaning. Expert testimony\n\nthat “does not comport with the plain language of the leases” is “no\n\nevidence.” Occidental Permian Ltd. v. Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d\n\n392, 399 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2011, pet. denied). See also Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. CBI Industries, 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 (Tex. 1995)\n\n(“[E]xtrinsic evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the meaning\n\nof the explicit language of the parties’ written agreement.”). Murphy’s\n\nexpert affidavit contradicts the explicit language of the Leases and is\n\n“no evidence” of the meaning of Paragraph 25.\n\n      The cases Murphy cites in its brief in support of expert testimony are\n\ninapposite. Contreras v. Clint Ind. Sch. Dist., 347 S.W.3d 413, 420 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2011, no pet.), involved an expert affidavit to explain the\n\nmedical term “complication” in a settlement agreement – a word not\n\nreadily understood in the medical context. Similarly, XCO Production\n                                      16\n\fCo. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622, 629-30 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2006, pet. denied), involved a tax expert’s testimony regarding the\n\naccounting methodology and terms used in a partnership agreement –\n\nnot words readily defined in a dictionary. Moreover, unlike Murphy’s\n\nexpert, the expert in XCO did not contradict the plain meaning of\n\nwords in the agreement. See id. at 629, n.4.\n\n     If, however, expert testimony is appropriate, Murphy’s expert’s\n\ntestimony is not conclusive but is, instead, both illogical and contradicted\n\nby the very RRC documents on which he relies.            It is also directly\n\ncontroverted by the Herbsts’ expert, Gregg Robertson, who has over 35\n\nyears of experience in the oil and gas industry. SCR 238-42. And Mr.\n\nRobertson’s testimony is not based on his bare opinions but, instead on the\n\ndictionary and industry definitions in the Herbsts’ motion papers; the\n\nLeases; his vast experience in the oil and gas business, including experience\n\nreviewing hundreds of oil and gas leases; his knowledge of RRC rules and\n\nindustry practice and terminology; and his review of Mr. McBeath’s\n\ncompeting affidavit. SCR 238-42.\n\n\n\n\n                                     17\n\fII.   The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s fees. (Issue\n      Two)\n\n      A.   The trial court had no statutory authority to award attorney’s\n           fees.\n\n      There is no legal basis for awarding Murphy any attorney’s fees in\n\nthis case. The Herbsts sued Murphy for breach of contract. SCR 5-11.\n\nMurphy counterclaimed for attorneys’ fees under Chapters 37 and 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. SCR 116. Neither provides a\n\nbasis for a recovery of fees by Murphy.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 17) that it is entitled to recover fees under Chapter\n\n37, which is the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). Murphy\n\ndoes not discuss the 2009 and 2011 Texas Supreme Court cases that the\n\nHerbsts relied on in their brief – MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co.,\n\nL.P., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669-70 (Tex. 2009), and Etan Indus. v. Lehmann, 359\n\nS.W.3d 620, 624 (Tex. 2011). Both of these cases hold that, when a request\n\nfor declaratory judgment is merely “tacked onto” a breach of contract\n\nclaim, it cannot be a basis for a fee award. MBM, 660 S.W.3d at 670; Etan,\n\n359 S.W.3d at 624. Here, Murphy’s UDJA counterclaim sought to determine\n\nwhether Murphy had breached the Leases (SCR 115-16) and was “part and\n\nparcel” of the contract claim. MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 671.\n\n                                     18\n\f      Murphy ignores these authorities. Instead, Murphy relies (at 17) on a\n\n1989 case neither party cited in the trial court, Winslow v. Acker, 781 S.W.2d\n\n322, 328 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1989, writ denied). Winslow is not on\n\npoint. First, in Winslow, the “appellants’ lawsuit sought recovery of their\n\nalleged proportion of the overriding royalty interests which were assigned\n\nto appellees,” but the appellees’ counterclaim would settle “all future\n\ndisputes as to the granting of royalties under the partition deed.” Id. at 328\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, the court found that the declaratory relief would\n\nresolve issues beyond those presented in the plaintiffs’ suit. Id. Second,\n\nthe court had another ground for allowing the relief – the appellants had\n\nwaived any right to challenge the declaratory judgment action. Id. Third,\n\nthe issue of whether attorney’s fees could be recovered as part of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action was not even at issue – appellees had non-\n\nsuited their request for fees. Id. at 323.\n\n      Murphy claims (at 18) that its declaratory judgment action, like that\n\nin Winslow, involved a “proper interpretation of the Leases [that] will reach\n\nbeyond the current dispute.” An examination of the relief the trial court\n\ngranted in this case shows that Murphy is wrong. The trial court did not\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fdecide anything other than the current dispute. It ruled, using language\n\nproposed by Murphy:\n\n     a.    Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous;\n     b.     The Herbst #1H Well, on which Murphy commenced\n     drilling operations June 8, 2012, was drilled as an off-set well\n     pursuant to Paragraph 25 of the Leases and satisfies the\n     requirements of Paragraph 25 of the Leases; and\n     c.     Murphy has not breached the Leases with regard to the\n     drilling and completion of the Herbst #1H Well and does not\n     owe compensatory royalties or any other obligations under\n     Paragraph 25 as a result.\n\nSCR 415.\n\n     These “declarations” do nothing more than resolve the breach of\n\ncontract dispute for which the Herbsts filed suit. They do not, as Murphy\n\nsuggests (at 18), “reach beyond the current dispute.” They address only\n\nthe well in question and the issue of whether Murphy breached the\n\nagreement by drilling that well instead of another one. Those are the very\n\nissues covered by the Herbsts’ breach of contract action.\n\n     B.    If the trial court had authority to award fees under the UDJA,\n           it abused its discretion in awarding fees on appeal.\n\n     If the Court holds that a fee award under the UDJA is available, the\n\nCourt should nevertheless reverse the district court’s award here. The trial\n\ncourt denied fees incurred in the trial court, reasoning that the Herbsts\n\n                                     20\n\f“had the right to present their arguments to the Court for the Court to\n\nmake a determination . . . and should not be penalized by having to pay\n\nhuge amounts of attorney’s fees.” RR 47, l. 2 - 5. The trial court then\n\nawarded conditional fees to Murphy in the event the Herbsts sought\n\nappellate review.    SCR 486.     Having effectively found that it was not\n\n“equitable or just” to award trial court fees, the court had no basis for then\n\nholding that the Herbsts should be “penalized” with fees if they sought\n\nreview in this Court.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 20) there is no “rule or statute” or “policy or\n\nrationale” to prevent a trial court from denying trial court fees but\n\nawarding appellate fees. There may not be a formal rule or a statute, but\n\nthere is strong policy and rationale for holding that the trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it makes such an award.\n\n      As the court of appeals stated in Reagan v. Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d\n\n70, 83-84 (Tex. App-Waco 2001, no pet.), such an award “could serve only\n\nto place a financial disincentive” on parties to exercise their right to appeal.\n\nBoth Reagan and United Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897, 906\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.), reversed trial\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fcourts that did what the trial court did here. Penalizing parties for seeking\n\nappellate review of a trial court’s decision is not appropriate.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 20) that these cases are “not controlling” but fails\n\nto provide any reason why the same result should not obtain here. Nor has\n\nMurphy provided the court with any decision where a trial court did this\n\nand was affirmed on appeal.\n\n                      CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n      For the reasons stated, the Herbsts respectfully pray that the Court\n\nreverse the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for Murphy as well as\n\nits award of fees and remand this case to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings. The Herbsts seek such other and further relief, including the\n\ncosts of this appeal, to which they may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\fRespectfully submitted,\nGRAVES DOUGHERTY HEARON &\nMOODY, P.C.\nBy: /s/ Mary A.

See 1 B. Kramer and P. Martin, Pooling\n   and Unitization 2-3 (3d ed. 1989).\n\nOffset royalty\n       A royalty payable under the provisions of an occasional lease in lieu of\n   the drilling of an offset well.\n      When a lessee has separate leases on two adjacent tracts, A and B,\n   if he drills a well on tract A which drains tract B, under the OFFSET WELL\n   COVENANT (q.v.) he will normally be obligated to drill an offsef-well on tract\n   B to protect it from drainage. The drilling of such additional well may be\n   uneconomic in that existing wells suffice to recover the oil or gas in place.\n   Under these circumstances, the lessee may elect,:to :pay the owners of\n   royalty interests in tract B an offset royalty, if the lease:of tract :B contains\n   an offset royalty clause, instead of drilling the offset well otherwise required.\n   The offset royalty may be a flat annual sum or may be measured in some\n   other way, e.g., by the royalty which would have been paid if the offset\n   well had been drilled and placed in production. One type of offset royalty\n   clause appears in Foster v. Atlantic Refining Co., 329 F.2d 485,20 0.&G.R.1\n   422 (5th,Cir. 1964).\n      For a case concluding that an overriding royalty owner was entitled to\n   recover offset royalty for drainage when the drilling of a well on the drained\n   tract was precluded by the lessor who was. also the lessor of the tract\n   containing the draining well, see Cook v. El Paso Natural. Gas; Co., 560.F.2d\n   978, 58 Q.&G.R. 206 (10th Cir. 1977).\n       See also COMPENSATORY ROYALTY; SUBSTITUTE ROYALTY.\n\nOffset royalty clause\n      An express lease clause permitting the lessee to pay royalty in lieu of\n   drilling an offset well. See OFFSET ROYALTY.\n\nOffset well\n      (1) A well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the drainage of oil or\n   gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a well is being drilled or is already\n   in production.\n      Prior to spacing regulations, wells along a surface mpertyline were\n   sometimes drilled in such profusion that they looked somewhat like fence\n   pests. Under spacing regulations, Well's are required to be drilled'Oh tracts\n   of a specified ',size. Where the spacing 'Unit is forty abrens, the Well can'be\n   drilled in the center. This type of developmen't of an oil field 'is called direct\n   offsetting, since the wells will be directly north and south or east and west\n   of each,other. Where the spacing unit is 20 acres, the well oneach unit\n   must be diagonal with the, well on the next unit. This pattern of develop-\n   ment is called DIAGONAL OFFSETTING (Q. v.)'\n      See also EQUIDISTANT OFFSET RULE.\n(Matthew Bender & Co., Inc.)

My employer, Platt Sparks is a petroleum engineering consulting firm that provides\n\n            consulting services to its clients in the oil and gas industry with regard to a wide array of\n\n            oil and gas related issues including, but not limited to, regulatory compliance and filings,\n\n            reservoir engineering studies, log analysis, reserve determination, economic analysis, fair\n\n            market value determinations, reservoir simulation, damage analysis, and lease royalty\n\n            provision analysis. A significant portion of my practice involves advising clients with\n\n            respect to Eagle Ford Shale (\"EFS\") formation exploration and development issues. I\n\n            have numerous clients involved in this trend and routinely advise them on issues such as\n\n            permitting wells, regulatory compliance, operational issues and other petroleum\n\n            engineering matters. As such,' I am familiar with terminology and issues applicable to\n\n            operations within the EFS.\n\n      4.    I am a 1987 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science\n\n            degree in Petroleum Engineering.

I have reviewed PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n            dated September 5, 2013: I have been asked by counsel for Murphy to respond to\n\n            Plaintiffs' assertion that the Herbst B 1H Well is not an \"offset well\" under paragraph 25\n\n            of the leases at issue. (\"Shirley Lease\" and \"William Lease\") Specifically, I have been\n\n            asked whether the term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and if so,\n\n            whether it has a commonly understand meaning within the industry.\n\n      6.    The following is a list of information considered in my study:\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. IVIeBEATFI, P.E.

The EFS is a formation that underlies much of South Texas. It lies directly below the\n\n            Austin Chalk formation and has long been recognized as the hydrocarbon source rock for\n\n            the Austin Chalk. The EFS lies directly above the Buda Limestone formation. The EFS\n\n           varies in thickness from 20 feet to over 500 feet and in quality from top to bottom with\n\n           the Upper portion being carbonate-rich and the Lower portion shale-rich. The productive\n\n           part of the EFS is divided into oil, wet gas and dry gas areas. Exhibit JCM I contains a\n\n           map from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showing the different\n\n           producing areas of the EFS. Although a few wells historically produced from the\n\n           formation, development began in earnest in 2008 with the drilling of wells in La Salle\n\n           County by PetroHawk. These wells were the discovery of the Hawkville (Eagle Ford)\n\n           Field. Development has continued through current with most activity concentrated in the\n\n           oil and wet gas windows due to attractive liquids prices. Drilling efficiency has\n\n           improved significantly as well as the fine tuning of hydraulic fracture stimulation\n\n           treatments. Current development includes twenty-six Counties located in six RRC\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATFI, P.E.                                           Page 3\n\n174\n\f            districts. Exhibit JCM 3 is map from the RRC website showing the EFS development as\n\n            of January 2014.\n\n      8.    The Lucas \"A\" 1H well was drilled by Comstock Oil & Gas, LP in December 2011,\n\n            targeting the EFS. The RRC well completion papers and directional surveys all indicate\n\n            that the horizontal lateral was landed in the EFS. The form W-2 filed by Comstock\n\n            indicates that the well was completed on February 23, 2012. Exhibit JCM 4 is a\n\n            collection of RRC forms relating to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well. I have also reviewed the\n\n            RRC completion papers and directional survey for the Murphy Herbst B 1H well.\n\n            Drilling was initiated on Murphy's Herbst B 1H well on June 8, 2012. The Herbst well\n\n            horizontal lateral was also completed in the EFS. Exhibit JCM 5 is a collection of RRC\n\n            forms relating to the Herbst B 1H well.\n\n      9.    Drilling began on the Murphy Herbst B 1H well less than 120 days after the Comstock\n\n            Lucas \"A\" 1P1 well was completed.\n\n      10.   Based on the information contained in the Affidavit of Mr. Kane Heinen, it is clear that\n\n            the Herbst B 1H well was drilled by Murphy to fulfill their obligation under paragraph 25\n\n            of the Shirley and Williams leases.\n\n      11.   The Murphy Herbst B 1H well was drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n\n            from which the Comstock Lucas \"A\" 1H well produces.\n\n      12.   Based on my review of Plaintiffs' petition and motion for summary judgment, it is my\n\n            understanding that Plaintiffs contend that the Murphy Herbst B 1H Well is not an offset\n\n            well to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well because it is not as close as legally possible to the lease\n\n            line of the Lucas \"A\" lease. Plaintiffs' use of the term \"offset well\" is not consistent with\n\n            the industry use of the term.\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                  Page 4\n\n175\n\f      13.   The term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the oil and gas industry and is\n\n            commonly understood within the industry as describing any well drilled on an adjacent\n\n            lease or property. The term \"offset well\" can also refer to the closest well, even if it is\n\n            located on another lease. It is my opinion that Plaintiffs are viewing the term \"offset\n\n            well,\" as used in paragraph 25 of the Lease, as \"direct offset well\". A direct offset well is\n\n            also a specialized term within the oil and gas industry, and is commonly understood to be\n\n            a well that is located directly across a lease line or other legal boundary. A direct offset\n\n            well can be located at the closest legal location or even closer if the operator applies for\n\n            and receives an RRC Rule 37 exception. A direct offset well is sometime called an\n\n            immediate offset well. Direct offset wells and immediate offset wells are included within\n\n            the term offset wells, but not all offset wells are direct or immediate offset wells.\n\n      14.   The term \"offset well\" is used in RRC Rule 36 to define which wells can be used to\n\n            estimate the escape rate for use in calculating a radius of exposure for a well subject to\n\n            Rule 36. The RRC has never limited the wells available in this determination to wells\n\n            directly across the lease line, and Rule 36 is further evidence of how the term offset well\n\n            is understood within the industry.\n\n      15.   RRC form H-1, related to RRC Rule 46, shows that the term \"offset well\" is -understood\n\n            within the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property.. The H-1 form\n\n            requires offset wells within Y2 mile of the subject well to be identified on a map.\n\n      16.   Finally, RRC Proposals for Decisions (\"PFD\") and Final Orders (\"FO\") XX-XXXXXXX, 8A-\n\n            0211820, XX-XXXXXXX and 7C-0240684 contain further examples of the RRC's use of the\n\n            terms offset well, direct offset well and immediate offset well. These PFDs and FOs\n\n            further confirm that each of these specialized terms have a commonly understood\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. MeBEATH, P.E.                                                   Page 5\n\n176\n\f            industry meaning, and that the term \"offset well\" is any well located on an adjacent\n\n            property, not just a well located directly across the lease line at the closest legal location.\n\n            That is a \"direct offset well.\"\n\n      17.   Based on my experience working with operators and other participants within the\n\n            industry, the usage of these terms by the RRC is consistent with how the terms are\n\n            commonly understood within the industry.\n\n      18.   I have reviewed the Shirley lease, dated August 14, 2009, and it is my opinion that the\n\n            Lease was drafted specifically for horizontal drilling in the EFS. The lease contains\n\n            specific language regarding horizontal wells and the size of pooled units associated with\n\n            horizontal wells. By August 2009, there was significant EFS development activity\n\n            nearby in Live Oak and Karnes Counties.\n\n      19.   Plaintiffs' contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to protect their\n\n            acreage from drainage is not correct. Due to the reservoir characteristics of the EFS, the\n\n            formation will not produce without large multi-stage hydraulic fracture jobs that provide\n\n            pathways between the formation and the wellbore. In the early development of the trend,\n\n            it was recognized that even with these hydraulic fracture stimulation jobs, a relatively\n\n            modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal well. The RRC assigned leaSe\n\n            line spacing rules that reflect this reality. Recently, several operators have installed pilot\n\n            programs to test the sensitivity of well spacing to well recoveries. Early indications\n\n            confirm that spacing horizontal laterals as close as 225 feet results in well recoveries\n\n            comparable to much wider spaced laterals.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATII, P.E.                                                  Page 6\n\n177\n\f      2l.   The reservoir characteristics of the EFS further support my conclusion that the\n\n            specialized term \"offset well,\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Lease, is not commonly\n\n            understood as a well drilled within 3.50 feet of the Lease line, as Plaintiffs contend.\n\n      21.   Plaintiffs refer to Williams and Meyers' Manual of Oil & Gas Terms for the definition of\n\n            Offset Clause. The definition of Offset Clause refers to Offset Well, another definition in\n\n            Williams & Meyers. Although Williams and Meyers states that the Offset Well is\n\n            intended to prevent drainage, neither definitions refer to a specific distance requirement\n\n            for an Offset Well. As stated above, the conventional concept of drainage across lease\n\n            lines has limited application in the EFS. Williams & Meyers offset well definition does\n\n            refer to \"direct offsetting\" when discussing wells that are directly across lease line on\n\n            equal-sized spacing units. Plaintiffs also refer to two on-line dictionaries having the same\n\n            definition of offset well. Before reading the Plaintiffs' motion I had not encountered\n\n            these sources. As stated above, it is my opinion that the term offset well encompasses the\n\n            more narrowly defined direct offset well. The on-line definitions used by Plaintiffs' more\n\n            accurately describe direct offset wells. My personal copy of \"A Dictionary of Petroleum\n\n            Terms\" 2\" ed. contains the following definition:\n\n                   offset well n: a well drilled on a tract of land next to another owner's tract on\n                   which there is a producing well.\n\n      22.   Based on my review of the information discussed above and my professional experience\n\n            in the industry for the past 25 years, it is my opinion that the Herbst B 114 well drilled by\n\n            Murphy on the Shirley and William leases is an offset well as that term is commonly\n\n            understood and used in the industry and paragraph 25 of the leases.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C.

I am over 18 years of a0, of sound mind, and\n\n      capable of making this affidavit. Except where indicated otherwise, the facts stated in this\n\n      affidavit are within. my personal knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n             2.      For the past thirty-five years I have worked in the family oil and gas business in\n\n      Corpus Christi, Texas that was founded by my father in 1975. We have provided consulting\n\n      geological services to other companies, operated a well service company for twenty years,\n\n      operated oil and gas production for thirty years and have been partners with numerous other oil\n\n      and gas companies in various oil and gas exploration and production ventures. My father was\n\n      instrumental in providing geologic supervision to the early pioneers in the Austin Chalk Trend\n\n      beginning in 1974, and I joined with Petrohawk Energy to drill the initial discovery wells for the\n\n      Hawkville (Eagle Ford Shale) Field in 2008.\n                                                                              EXHIBIT\n\n                                                      1\n                                                                                                2033219,1\n238\n\f              3.\n                           •                                            •\n                        My educational background includes a BA, in English from Sewanee: The\n\n      University of the. South in 1978, followed by studies at the graduate school of Geology at the\n\n      University of Texas, Austin from .1979-1980.\n\n              4.        I have reviewed the Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Suminary Judgment in the\n\n      above-described and numbered cause, the Affidavit of John C. McBeathi P.E, and the Railroad\n\n      Commission filings for the Comstrock Oil & Gas, LP OH Lucas \"A\" well and the .Murphy\n\n      Exploration and Production #11I Herbst \"B\" well, as well as the relevant portion of the Oil, Gas\n\n      and Mineral Leases covering the land where the Herbst well is drilled. I have been asked whether\n\n      the term. \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and what its commonly\n\n      understood meaning is within the industry, More specifically, I have 1Jeen asked whether. the\n\n      Murphy #111 Herbst \"IV Well is an \"offset well\" to the Comstock #1H Ilmeas \"A' Well, as that\n\n      term is used 'in Paragraph 25 of the Herbst leases.\n\n               5.     It is my opinion that the Murphy -#1H Herbst \"13\" Well is not an \"offset well\" to\n\n      the Comstock #1H Lucas \"A\" Well, as that term is used in the industry) and in the oil and gas\n\n      lease. An \"offset well\", as that term is used in the industry, is a well drillei!I as close as :possible to\n\n      the offending well in order to prevent or minimize drainage from the eased premises by the\n\n      offending well.\n\n              6.     • It is my understanding that there is no dispute that the governing. Oil, Gas, and\n\n      Mineral Leases are in effect and contain a Paragraph 25 with the \"offset cell provision\", that the\n\n      Comstock well was permitted and actually drilled closer than the 467' :buffer provided by the\n\n      offset well provision, and that. Murphy is relying upon the Herbst \"B\" , i1H well to satisfy the\n\n      remedies.required by the lease when a well is drilled within 467 feet of the leased premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          2\n                                                                                                        208321.9.1\n\n\n\n239\n\f              7.\n                                  •                                        •\n                      Mr. McBeath's affidavit has two arguments to support his opinion that the\n\n      Murphy #1H Herbst \"B\" Well satisfies Murphy's obligations under Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\n      leases: First, Mr. McBeath makes a distinction between the term \"offset Well\" and the conjecture\n\n      of a more specifically used term in the industry of \"direct offset well\". ► Second, Mr. McBeath\n\n      argues that the lease provision relating to an offset well has nothing to do with the potential for\n\n      drainage of the leased premises by the Comstock well (\"Plaintiffs contention that an offset well,\n\n      as used in the Lease, exists to protect their acreage from drainage is not! correct.\" — .McBeath,\n\n      page 6). Neither of these arguments has any credibility based upon conventional oilfield usage,\n\n      traditional construction of the English language nor common sense\n\n              8.      Regarding Mr. McBeath's argument as to the purpose of Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      leases: based upon my involvement in the construction of several htmdre ' oil and gas leases, and\n\n      specifically over one hundred' oil and gas leases in the past five years r the development of\n\n      Eagle Ford Shale reserves, the inclusion of a provision such as the one in paragraph 25 requiring\n\n      remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on offset acreage has only one, sole purpose - to\n\n      prevent, compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises i?y the offending well.\n\n      Common sense precludes any other construction. In fact, Paragraph 25 resiuires the lessee to drill\n\n      an \"offset well\" if an offending well is drilled, which is specifically defined in the lease as a well\n\n      drilled within 467' of the leased premises, which. at the time the lease was executed, defined a\n\n      well drilled closer to the lease than Railroad Commission rules would allow. The stated distance\n\n      of a well from the leased premises defines the specific intent that the cor'responding location of\n\n      an \"off-set well\" drilled under Paragraph 25 (1) should be equally as elo4 to the offending well\n\n      as possible to protect the Lessors' reserves from drainage by the offending well. For Murphy to\n\n      state that the Herbst well, located over 2100 feet away from the offending•well and being also as\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n                                                                                                    2083219.1\n240\n\f                                 •                                        •\n      far away as the configuration of the lease would allow, satisfies the Leases' offset remedy cannot\n\n      be. supported by standard oilfield practice, the intent of the parties in negotiating the lease, or\n\n      common sense.\n\n              9.       Mr. MeBeath's attempt to explain a presumed difference Wetween \"an offset well\"\n\n      and \"a direct offset well\" has no basis in standard oilfield practices. .I liave never seen in any\n\n      written contract nor heard in any conversation, such a distinction being made. Asserting that\n\n      there is no connection between the term. \"offset well\" and. a specific distance from a lease line is\n\n      a contrived and desperate attempt to explain Murphy's actions in this !matter. It deserves no\n\n      further rebtittal.\n\n              10.      In the highly competitive and intense development setting Of the Eagle Ford Shale\n\n      Trend, it has been my practice and that of my partners in the drilling of over 300 wells across\n\n      265,000 acres, to contact offset operators prior to setting up a drilling patiprn that begins 330 feet\n\n      from the common property boundary. There are numerous alternatives to starting a development\n\n      program on an adjacent lease to another operator rather than drilling the 'closest offset well first.\n\n      To do so without attempting to centact the offset operator first is akin tO dropping the glove to\n\n      start a duel, Likewise, should this event occur, it is incomprehensibly that a Lessee would\n\n      unilaterally drill a. knowingly contentious location such as the .Murphyi #11-I Herbst \"B\" Well\n\n      without conducting transparent conversations with the Lessors first, If the Herbst tract of land\n\n      merited the drilling of a well, there was no purpose served for either Mnrphy or the Lessors by\n\n      leaving the potential for drainage by the offsetting Comstock well un4hallenged. In fact, the\n\n      proper development of the Herbst tract will require at least two additional wells, which will both\n\n      be significantly closer to the Comstock well than the current Herbst \"B\" Well. There is nothing in\n\n      the facts, viewed through the Y perspective of standard oilfield practices; nor in Mr.. MeBeath's\n\n\n\n                                                       4.\n                                                                                                    2083219.1\n241\n\f                                   •                                      •\n      affidavit, (which become specious when viewed through the perspective of the standard\n\n      construction of the English language and by common sense), that supports Murphy's claim that\n\n      its #1H Herbst \"B\" Well is an adequate remedy to satisfy its obligations under Paragraph 25 for\n\n      protection from an offending offset well.\n\n\n\n      FURTHER, AFFIANT .SAYETH NOT\n\n\n\n\n      STATE OF TEXAS\n\n      COUNTY ORNUECES\n\n              Subscribed and sworn to before me, the -undersigned authority on this the :0 1: day of April,\n      2014.\n\n\n\n                      DONNAANNVESMER\n                    MY COMMISSION.

There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n     in accordance with the provisions of Commission Statewide Rules 37 and 38, which\n     applicable provisions of said rules are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n            In applying this rule, the general order of the Commission with relation to the\n     subdivision of property shall be observed.\n\n            Provided, however, that for purposes of spacing for horizontal wells, the following\n     shall apply:\n\n            a.     A take point in a horizontal drainhole well is any point along a horizontal\n                   drainhole where oil and/or gas can be produced from the reservoir/field\n                   interval. The first take point may be at a different location than the\n                   penetration point and the last take point may be at a location different than\n                   the terminus point.\n\n            b.     No horizontal drainhole well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled such that\n                   the first and last take point are nearer than ONE HUNDRED (100) feet to any\n                   property line, lease line or subdivision line.\n\n            d.     For each horizontal drainhole well, the perpendicular distance from any take\n                   point on such horizontal drainhole between the first take point and the last\n                   take point to any point on any property line, lease line or subdivision line\n                   shall be a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet.\n\n            For the purpose of assigning additional acreage to a horizontal well pursuant to Rule\n     86, the distance from the first take point to the last take point in the horizontal drainhole\n     shall be used in such determination, in lieu of the distance from penetration point to\n     terminus.\n\n\n\n\n89\n\f                                                                       •\n     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS.

In addition to the\n     standard required data, the certified plat shall include the as-drilled track of the wellbore,\n     the location of each take point on the wellbore, the boundaries of any wholly or partially\n     unleased tracts within a Rule 37 distance of the wellbore, and notations of the shortest\n     distance from each wholly or partially unleased tract within a Rule 37 distance of the\n     wellbore to the nearest take point on the wellbore.\n\n            A properly permitted horizontal drainhole will be considered to be in compliance with\n     the spacing rules set forth herein if the as-drilled location falls within a rectangle\n     established as folloWs:\n\n            a.     Two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the permitted drainhole and 33 feet\n                   on either side of the drainhole;\n\n            b.     The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                   in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                   the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n            Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n     to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n     measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n             For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n     same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n     on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n     applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n     requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n     mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n     for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n     mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n     notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n     depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n     after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n\n\n\n\n90\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS. XX-XXXXXXX AND XX-XXXXXXX                                      PAGE 4\n\n     this rule, the applicant must publish notice of this application pursuant to the Commission's\n     Rules of Practice and Procedure. If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n     location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n     necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n     correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n     of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n     is the only mineral owner of the Offsite Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n     applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n     notice under this section, upon request.\n\n              RULE 3: The acreage assigned to the individual oil or gas well for the purpose of\n     allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n     drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n     unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided. All\n     proration units shall consist of continuous and contiguous acreage which can reasonably\n     be considered to be productive of oil. No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n\n            If after the drilling of the last well on any lease and the assignment of acreage to\n     each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n     additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n     remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n     assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n     among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n     inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n             For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n     or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n     Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n     of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n     For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n     the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n     proration units.\n\n            RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n     by multiplying 800 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the acreage\n     assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the maximum\n     acreage authorized by these field rules for proration purposes, exclusive of tolerance\n     acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio authority.\n\n           It is further ORDERED that all overproduction in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field,\n     Atascosa, Gonzales, La Salle, McMullen and Wilson Counties, Texas, is hereby canceled.\n\n           The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n     pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n\n\n\n91\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS.

The\n     Commission finds that, due to clerical error, the Final Order entered on May 15, 2012,\n     omitted the reference to a vertical well in Field Rule No. 4.\n\n            Accordingly, It is ORDERED that the Final Order in Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX be, and\n     the same is hereby amended nunc pro tunc, so that Field Rule No. 4 for the Eagleville\n     (Eagle Ford-1) Field contains the reference to a vertical well and the order now reads as\n     follows:\n\n            RULE 1: The entire correlative interval from 10,294 feet to 10,580 feet as shown\n     on the log of the EOG Resources, Inc. - Milton Unit, Well No. 1 (API No. 42-255-31608),\n     Section 64, John Randon Survey, A-247, Karnes County, Texas, shall be designated as\n     a single reservoir for proration purposes and be designated as the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-\n     1) Field.\n\n             RULE 2: No well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled nearer than THREE\n     HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line. There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n\n\n\n\n93\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO.

A take point in a horizontal drainhole well is any point along a horizontal\n                   drainhole where oil and/or gas can be produced from the reservoir/field\n                   interval. The first take point may be at a different location than the\n                   penetration point and the last take point may be at a location different than\n                   the terminus point.\n\n            b.     No horizontal drainhole well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled such that\n                   the first and last take point are nearer than ONE HUNDRED (100) feet to any\n                   property line, lease line or subdivision line.\n\n            d.     For each horizontal drainhole well, the perpendicular distance from any take\n                   point on such horizontal drainhole between the first take point and the last\n                   take point to any point on any property line, lease line or subdivision line\n                   shall be a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet.\n\n           For the purpose of assigning additional acreage to a horizontal well pursuant to\n     Statewide Rule 86, the distance from the first take point to the last take point in the\n     horizontal drainhole shall be used in such determination, in lieu of the distance from\n     penetration point to terminus.\n\n             In addition to the penetration point and the terminus of the wellbore required to be\n     identified on the drilling permit application (Form W-1H) and plat, the first and last take\n     points must also be identified on the drilling permit application (Remarks Section) and plat.\n     Operators shall file an as-drilled plat showing the path, penetration point, terminus and the\n     first and last take points of all drainholes in horizontal wells, regardless of allocation\n     formula.\n\n            If the applicant has represented in the drilling application that there will be one or\n     more no pert zones or \"NPZ's\" (portions of the wellbore within the field interval without take\n     points), then the as-drilled plat filed after completion of the well shall be certified by a\n     person with knowledge of the facts pertinent to the application that the plat is accurately\n     drawn to scale and correctly reflects all pertinent and required data.

The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                   in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                   the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n            Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n     to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n     measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n             For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n     same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n     on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n     applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n     requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n     mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n     for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n     mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n     notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n     depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n     after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n     this rule, the applicant must publish notice of this application pursuant to the Commission's\n     Rules of Practice and Procedure. If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n     location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n     necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n     correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n     of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n     is the only mineral owner of the Offsite. Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n     applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n     notice under this section, upon request.\n\n             RULE 3: The acreage assigned° to the individual oil well for the purpose of\n     allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n     drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n     unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided. All\n     proration units shall consist of continuous and contiguous acreage which can reasonably\n\n\n\n\n95\n\f                                                                       •\n     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO.

No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n     Additional acreage may be assigned to each horizontal drainhole well in accordance with\n     Statewide Rule 86.\n\n            If after the drilling of the last well on any lease and the assignment of acreage to\n     each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n     additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n     remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n     assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n     among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n     inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n            An operator, at his option, shall be permitted to form optional drilling units of FORTY\n     (40) acres. A proportional acreage allowable credit will be given for a well on a fractional\n     proration unit.\n\n             For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n     or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n     Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n     of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n     For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n     the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n     proration units. There is no maximum diagonal limitation in this field.\n\n            RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n     by multiplying 2,000 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\n     acreage assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the\n     maximum acreage authorized by these field rules for a vertical well for proration purposes,\n     exclusive of tolerance acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio\n     authority.\n\n             RULE 5: A flowing oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing\n     fees unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a)\n     exceptions, a six month exception to Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a) regarding the requirement\n     of having to be produced through tubing. A revised completion report will be filed once the\n     oil well has been equipped with the required tubing string to reflect the actual completion\n     configuration. This exception would be applicable for new drills, reworks, recompletions\n     or for new fracture stimulation treatments for any flowing oil well in the field. For good\n     cause shown, an operator may obtain administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n     unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a)\n     exceptions, an extension for an additional three months. If the request for an extension\n     of time is denied, the operator may request a hearing.\n\n            RULE 6: An oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n\n\n\n\n96\n\f                            •\n     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO.

This will allow for the\n     backdating of allowables on the oil wells without requiring a waiver to be secured from all\n     field operators. This rule will grant the Commission the authority to issue an allowable\n     back to the initial completion date for all oil wells in the field to prevent unnecessary shut-\n     ins to alleviate potential overproduction issues related to the completion paperwork filings\n     and producing the oil wells without tubing. If an extension of time is granted under Rule\n     5, the exception to Statewide Rule 51(a) under this rule is automatically extended for the\n     additional time.\n\n            It is further ORDERED that all overproduction in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1),\n     Dilworth (Eagle Ford), Leesville (Eagle Ford) and Pilgrim (Eagleford) Fields, Atascosa,\n     Dimmit, Gonzales, La Salle, McMullen, Wilson and Zavala Counties, Texas, is hereby\n     canceled.\n\n           The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n     pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n            Done this 26th day of June, 2012.\n\n                                                RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n                                                 (Order approved and signatures affixed by\n                                                 OGC Unprotested Master Order dated June\n                                                 26, 2012)\n\n\n\n\n97\n\f        TAB 9\n\nHerbsts’ Petition (SCR 5-11)\n\f                           •                                               •\n                                        CAUSE NO.        13-05-bLito - Neu\n     SHIRLEY ADAMS, CHARLENE BURGESS, §                            IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n     WILLIE MAE HERBST JASIK,\n     WILLIAM ALBERT HERBST,\n     HELEN HERBST and\n     R.

Plaintiff Shirley Mae Herbst Adams is the owner of the executive rights and the\n\nsurface and mineral estates in the Shirley Tract, subject to the Shirley Lease described below and\n\nthe royalty interests owned by the other Plaintiffs. Plaintiff William Albert Herbst is the owner\n\nof the executive rights and the surface and mineral estates in the William Tract, subject to the\n\nWilliam Lease described below and the royalty interests owned by the other Plaintiffs.\n\n       9.        Effective August 14, 2009, Plaintiffs Shirley Mae Herbst Adams for the Shirley\n\nTract and William Albert Herbst for the William Tract, executed and delivered oil and gas leases\n\nto Alvin M. Barrett & Associates, Inc., a Texas Corporation (\"Barrett\"), granting, leasing, and\n\nletting the land described above in Paragraph 7 for the purpose of exploring, drilling, mining for,\n\nand producing oil and gas from the described land. Copies of the leases and Memorandum of the\n\nleases are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B and incorporated by reference. Barrett\n\nsubsequently assigned the leases to Murphy. The lease of the Shirley Tract is referred to herein\n\nas the Shirley Lease and the lease of the William Tract is referred to as the William Lease.\n\n       10.       Comstock Oil & Gas, LP has recently drilled a well on the tract just to the\n\nsouthwest of the Shirley and William Leases — its Lucas \"A\" Lease, called the Lucas \"A\" #1H.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                                                    •\n    The well was completed in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field. It first produced in March 2012.\n\n    Railroad Commission records indicate that, through March 1, 2013, the well had produced\n\n    45,630 barrels of oil and 60,530 mcf of natural gas. According to the permit plat filed with the\n\n    Railroad Commission, the lateral of the well is located 350 feet from the boundaries of the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases.\n\n           11.     Murphy has drilled its Herbst Unit B #1H horizontal well on the Shirley and\n\n    William Leases. The well was spudded on June 7, 2012, and completed on July 7, 201.2. The\n\n    lateral of the well is located some 450 feet from the northeast line of the Shirley and William\n\n    Leases. This would make the Herbst Unit B #1H well approximately 1800 feet from the\n\n    southwest boundaries of the Shirley Lease and the William Lease. See plat attached as Exhibit C\n\n    showing the lease and unit boundaries and the location of the two wells.\n\n           12.     The Offset Clauses in the Shirley Lease and the William Lease are identical.\n\n    Found in Paragraph 25 of each Lease, the Offset Clauses provide that, if a well \"is completed as\n\n    a producer of oil and/or gas on land adjacent and contiguous to the leased premises, and within\n\n    467 feet of the premises covered by this lease, ... [then], within 120 days after the completion\n\n    date of the well or wells on the adjacent acreage,\" Lessee must either:\n\n           (1) commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and thereafter continue\n           the drilling of such off-set well or wells with due diligence to a depth adequate to\n           test the same formation from which the well or wells are producing from on the\n           adjacent acreage: or\n\n           (2) pay the Lessor royalties as provided for in this lease as if an equivalent\n           amount of production of oil and/or gas were being obtained from the off-set\n           location on these leased premises as that which is being produced from the\n           adjacent well or wells; or\n\n           (3) release an amount of acreage sufficient to constitute a spacing unit equivalent\n           in size to the spacing unit that would be allocated under this lease to such well or\n           wells on the adjacent lands, as to the zones or strata producing in such adjacent\n           well.\n\n                                                    4\n\n8\n\f                              •\n            13.        Murphy has done none of these three things.\n\n                                                V.      Causes of Action\n\n            14.        Plaintiffs incorporate the factual allegations contained in Section IV as if set forth\n\n    fully at length.\n\n                                       Cause of Action: Breach of Contract\n\n            15.        Plaintiffs sue for underpayment of royalties due under the Offset Clauses in the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek monetary relief over $200,000 as well as non-\n\n    monetary relief determining their rights under the Offset Clauses in the Shirley and William\n\n    Leases. At this time, Plaintiffs are not seeking monetary relief of more than $1,000,000, but\n\n    reserve the right to amend and seek recovery of amounts in excess of that amount if warranted.\n\n    Plaintiffs allege that the amount of underpayment under the Shirley and William Leases\n\n    increases each month that the Lucas \"A\" #1H continues to produce oil and/or gas and Defendant\n\n    fails to drill an offset well or release acreage pursuant to the terms .of the Offset Clauses\n\n    contained in the Shirley and William Leases.\n\n            16.        All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs' recovery have occurred.\n\n            17.        Plaintiffs seek recovery of the underpaid royalties due under Offset Clauses in the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek recovery of interest pursuant to the terms of the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek all reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees that they\n\n    have incurred. See Tex. Civ. Pr. & Rem. Code §§ 38.001-38.006; Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann.\n\n    § 91.406. Plaintiffs also seek recovery of their costs of court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5\n\n9\n\f                            •\n                                   Cause of Action: Declaratory Judgment\n\n            18.     Plaintiffs move the Court to issue declaratory judgments and construe the rights of\n\n     the parties to .the Shirley and William Leases, including the rights of all royalty owners, pursuant\n\n     to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek a\n\n     declaratory judgment of the Court that: (i) Murphy, as the lessee under the Shirley and William\n\n     Leases, is required either to drill an offset • well within 350 feet of the boundary between the\n\n     Shirley and William Leases and the lands on which the Lucas \"A\" #1H is located or to pay\n\n     substitute royalties or release acreage per the terms of the Offset Clauses in each Lease; (ii)\n\n     Murphy is required to pay offset royalties per the terms of the Offset Clauses based on all\n\n     production from the. Lucas \"A\" #1H that occurs more than 120 days after the commencement of\n\n     production on that well until Murphy either releases acreage or drills an offset well in accordance\n\n     with the terms of the Leases; and (iii) the Herbst Unit B #1H horizontal well drilled by Murphy\n\n     does not qualify as an offset well under the Offset Clauses of the Leases.\n\n            19.     Plaintiffs pray for recovery of their costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys'\n\n     fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 37.009.\n\n                                        VI.

Murphy drilled the Herbst Well as an offset to the Lucas Well, specifically to\n\n      satisfy its obligations under Paragraph 25. On information and belief, the Herbst Well was\n\n      drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formation as the Lucas Well, as required by\n\n      Paragraph 25. Plaintiffs are now receiving royalties from the Herbst Well. Neither Paragraph\n\n      25, nor any other portion of the Leases, requires Murphy to drill a well in a specific location or\n\n      within a specific distance from the boundaries of the Leases. Murphy, acting a reasonably\n\n      prudent operator, selected the best location for the Herbst Well and drilled a successful well\n\n      adequate to test the same Eagle Ford formation in which the Lucas Well was completed.\n\n                13.     Thus, Murphy has fully complied with the obligation under Paragraph 25 to drill\n\n      an off-set well with due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation.\n\n                                             IV. COUNTERCLAIM\n\n      A.        Declaratory Judgment\n\n                14.     Murphy incorporates the foregoing paragraphs by reference as if fully set forth\n\n      herein.\n\n                15.     Murphy seeks a declaration that Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous as a\n\n      matter of law and that Murphy has complied with Paragraph 25.\n\n                16.     Specifically, Murphy seeks a declaration that Paragraph 25 requires Murphy \"to\n\n      commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and thereafter continue the drilling of such\n\n      off-set well or wells with due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation from\n\n      which the well or wells are producing from on the adjacent acreage.\"\n\n                17.     Murphy seeks a further declaration that \"off-set well\" as used within Paragraph 25\n\n      of the Leases is a specialized term with a commonly understood meaning within the industry and\n\n      that by drilling the Herbst Well, Murphy complied with Paragraph 25 of the Leases.\n\n\n\n\n      Active 11441659                                   4\n115\n\f                18.     Finally, Murphy seeks a declaration that it has not breached the Leases, and that it\n\n      does not owe compensatory or other royalties to Plaintiffs as a result.\n\n                19.     Alternatively, in the event the Court were to find that the Lease is susceptible to\n\n      two reasonable interpretations, Murphy seeks a declaration from this Court that Paragraph 25 of\n\n      the Leases is ambiguous in that it does not define the term \"off-set well\" and that term, as used in\n\n      Paragraph 25, is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.\n\n                20.     Murphy seeks a further declaration that \"off-set well\" is a specialized term with a\n\n      commonly understood meaning within the industry and that by drilling the Herbst Well, Murphy\n\n      complied with the intent of the parties and industry practice as expressed in Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      Leases.\n\n                21.     Finally, Murphy seeks a declaration that it has not breached the Leases, and that it\n\n      does not owe compensatory or other royalties to Plaintiffs as a result.\n\n      C.        Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n\n                22.     Pursuant to Chapters 37 and 38 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code,\n\n      Murphy seeks its reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in prosecuting its\n\n      counterclaim.\n\n                                      V.    CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n                        Murphy requests that the Court, after trial or final hearing, enter judgment in its\n\n      favor:\n\n                        (a)    that Plaintiffs take nothing by reason of this suit;\n\n                        (b)    that the Court enter declarations that:\n\n                               (i)     Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous;\n\n                               (ii)    The Herbst Well satisfies Paragraph 25 of the Leases; and\n\n\n\n\n      Active 11441659                                     5\n116\n\f          TAB 11\n\nExcept from Murphy’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (SCR 123)\n\f      A.       The Herbst Well Qualifies As An Offset Well Under Paragraph 25 Of The Leases.\n\n                          Under Paragraph 25 of the Leases, once a well is drilled within 467 feet of the\n\n      Lease boundary, Murphy has an obligation, within 120 days, to do one of three things: (1) drill\n\n      an offset well, (2) pay compensatory royalties as if the triggering well was completed on the\n\n      Lease, or (3) release acreage. Murphy chose to drill an offset well, which is required to be\n\n      drilled \"to a depth adequate to test the same formation from which the well or wells are\n\n      producing from on the adjacent acreage.\" (Leases ¶ 25.)\n\n                          The Herbst Well complies with each and every requirement of Paragraph 25 of\n\n      the Leases. The Herbst Well was drilled within 120 days of the completion of the Lucas Well on\n\n      the adjacent property. (Heinen Aff. ¶ 11.) The Herbst Well was drilled to an adequate depth to\n\n      test the same formation from which the Lucas Well was producing. (McBeath Aff. ¶ 11.) And,\n\n      as noted above, Murphy drilled the Herbst Well on the Leases specifically to offset the Lucas\n\n      Well. (Heinen Aff. ¶ 9.)\n\n      B.       \"Off-set well\" Is A Specialized Term With A Commonly Understood Meaning\n               Within The Oil And Gas Industry.\n\n               1.         Extrinsic evidence is admissible and necessary to explain the meaning of \"off-\n                          set well\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Leases.\n\n                          Extrinsic evidence is \"admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning\n\n      consistent with that to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to interpret contractual terms.\"\n\n      Mescalero Energy Inc. v.

That Mr. Stei nl e I f he\n\n13   wanted and the parti es wanted to I i mi t where that\n\n14   offset dri I I needed to be pl aced on the adj acent\n\n15   property in terms of how many feet from the I ease\n\n16   1 i ne that coul d have been put i n the I ease, but i t\n\n17   wasn' t.   And so the we! I was drilled wi thi n the\n\n18   ti meframe requi red. And the Court has found i t to be\n\n19   an offset wel I . And the Court of Appeal s may very\n\n20   wel I tel I me that was i ncorrect.       And I wel come that\n\n21   fi ndi ng i f that i s the fi ndi ng.   I am not a bi g fan\n\n22   of I i mi ti ng parti es access to the courts.     And\n\n23   frankly my thi nki ng on not awarding attorney's fees\n\n24   as a resul t of the tri al proceedi ng was that the\n\n25   PI ai nti ffs were certai n1 y enti tl ed to thei r thoughts\n\n\n                              (210) 415-6628\n\f                                                               47\n\n 1   as to the offset well needing to be drilled closer\n\n 2   and had the right to present their arguments to the\n\n 3   Court for the Court to make a determination on that,\n\n 4   and should not be penalized by having to pay huge\n\n 5   amounts of attorney's fees. And so attorney's fees\n\n 6   were not awarded, And I will change my order to the\n\n 7   extent of reducing the amount of attorney's fees\n\n 8   reasonable and necessary on appeal. And the Court of\n\n 9   Appeals can then determine whether or not that's an\n\n10   appropriate decision by this Court as well.     So fix\n\n11   me up something that comports with my ruling, y'all\n\n12   both sign i t, and I will be happy to sign it as well.\n\n13                   MS.

And it\n\n16   seems to me our rights to an appeal would be\n\n1/   consistent with that, that there would be no fees on\n\n18   appeal , there would be no fees at trial.\n\n19                   MR.

J. 831\n\n   such lawyer shall have none of the relationships to Americo or Myer (or any of their Affiliates)\n   that are proscribed above for arbitrators.\n\nThe agreement combines terms expressly chosen by the parties with the incorporation by\nreference of American Arbitration Association rules to govern the arbitration proceeding. When\nthe parties executed their agreement, AAA rules did not require arbitrator-impartiality, but by\nthe time Americo invoked arbitration in 2005 after disputes arose concerning the additional\npayments to Myer, the AAA rules by default required that “[a]ny arbitrator shall be impartial and\nindependent ... and shall be subject to disqualification for ... partiality or lack of independence....”\nAAA Commercial Arbitration Rules R–17(a)(I) (2003).\n\nMyer alleged that Americo's first-choice arbitrator, Ernest Figari, Jr., was partial toward Americo,\nand successfully moved the AAA to disqualify him. Americo objected to Figari's disqualification\nbut named another arbitrator, about whom Myer likewise complained, and whom the AAA\nlikewise struck. Myer did not object to Americo's third appointee, who ultimately served on the\npanel. The arbitration proceeding resulted in a unanimous award in Myer's favor amounting to just\nover $26 million in payments due, breach-of-contract damages, and attorneys' fees.\n\nWhen Myer moved to confirm the award in the trial court, Americo renewed its objection to Figari's\ndisqualification. Americo argued that in disqualifying Figari for partiality, the AAA failed to\nfollow the arbitrator-selection process specified in the parties' agreement, which provided only that\n“each arbitrator shall be a knowledgeable, independent businessperson or professional.” The trial\ncourt determined the arbitration agreement was ambiguous but ultimately agreed with Americo's\nreading and vacated the award. Myer appealed, and the court of appeals reversed on the ground\nthat Americo had waived its objection to Figari's removal. We reversed that decision. Americo\nLife, Inc. v. Myer, 356 S.W.3d 496 (Tex.2011) (per curiam). On remand, the court of appeals\nagain reversed, this time on the merits, holding the arbitration agreement was unambiguous and\nthe arbitration panel was properly appointed under both the terms of the agreement and the AAA\nrules. Nearly ten years after arbitration proceedings commenced between the parties, their case\nagain comes before this Court.\n\n\n\n                                                     II\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] Arbitrators derive their power from the parties' agreement to submit to\narbitration.

See id. (citing 11\nRICHARD A. LORD, WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS § 32.7 (4th ed.1999)). When interpreting\nan integrated writing, the parol-evidence rule precludes considering evidence that would render a\ncontract ambiguous when the document, on its face, is capable of a definite legal meaning. Sun Oil\nCo. (Del.) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731–32 (Tex.1981). The rule does not, however, prohibit\nconsidering surrounding facts and circumstances that inform the contract text and render it capable\nof only one meaning. See id.; Wellington, 352 S.W.3d at 469.\n\n\n\n                                                     III\n\n\n                                                      A\n\n [8] [9] To determine the parties' intent, we examine the express language of their agreement.\nItalian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323, 333 (Tex.2011).\nIn their agreement, the parties directly addressed the issue of arbitrator qualifications and\nagreed on a short list of requirements, namely that each arbitrator must be a “knowledgeable,\nindependent businessperson or professional.” Americo argues the court of appeals improperly\nadded “impartial” to the parties' list of qualifications. Myer counters that because “independent”\nand “impartial” are essentially synonymous, Americo was always obligated to name an impartial\narbitrator.\n\n [10] We disagree that “independent” may be read interchangeably with “impartial.” Various\ndictionary definitions might support some overlap between the two words, but when applied in\nthe arbitration context, they carry distinct meanings. The parties in this case agreed to “tripartite\narbitration,” through which each party would directly appoint an arbitrator, and the two party-\nappointed arbitrators would agree on a third panelist. This method was commonplace when the\nparties executed their agreement in 1998. See Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. TUCO Inc., 960 S.W.2d\n629, 630 & n. 2 (Tex.1997) (describing the method as “often-used”). In a tripartite arbitration,\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 831\n\neach party-appointed arbitrator ordinarily advocates for the appointing party, and only the third\narbitrator is considered neutral. See, e.g., Winfrey v. Simmons Foods, Inc., 495 F.3d 549, 552\n(8th Cir.2007) (noting the “industry custom that party arbitrators are frequently not required or\nexpected to be neutral for ruling on disputes”); Lozano v. Md. Cas. Co., 850 F.2d 1470, 1472 (11th\nCir.1988) (per curiam) (“An arbitrator appointed by a party is a partisan only one step removed\nfrom the controversy and need not be impartial.”); Metro. Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co. v. J.C. Penney\nCas. Ins. Co., 780 F.Supp. 885, 892 (D.Conn.1991) (In tripartite arbitration, “each party's arbitrator\n‘is not individually expected to be neutral.’ ”) (quoting Soc'y for Good Will to Retarded Children\nv. Carey, 466 F.Supp. 722, 728 (E.D.N.Y.1979)); Matter of Astoria Med. Grp. (Health Ins. Plan of\nGreater N.Y.), 11 N.Y.2d 128, 227 N.Y.S.2d 401, 182 N.E.2d 85, 87 (1962) ( “[T]here has grown\na common acceptance of the fact that the *23 party-designated arbitrators are not and cannot be\n‘neutral,’ at least in the sense that the third arbitrator or a judge is.”).\n\nIn fact, the arbitration agreement in Burlington, like the agreement in this case, “did not specify\nwhether the two arbitrators that the parties unilaterally selected ... would be neutral or would\nrepresent the interests of the party appointing them.” Burlington, 960 S.W.2d at 630. But in\nBurlington, unlike this case, there was “no dispute ... that the parties intended and understood\nthat the party arbitrators would be aligned with, act as advocates for, and ultimately side with the\nappointing party.” Id.\n\nThe AAA rules in place when the agreement was executed likewise reflect the prevalence of\nthis practice. At that time, the rules provided that “[u]nless the parties agree otherwise, an\narbitrator selected unilaterally by one party is a party-appointed arbitrator and not subject to\ndisqualification pursuant to Section 19.” AAA Commercial Arbitration § 12 (1996). Section 19\ncontained procedures to challenge arbitrators for partiality. See id., § 19. Accordingly, the AAA\nrules presumed party-appointed arbitrators were non-neutral, and the parties would have to “agree\notherwise” to rebut this presumption.\n\nThe only indication the parties sought to “agree otherwise” is their requirement that party-\nappointed arbitrators be “independent.” Americo argues that the parties chose the word\n“independent” not to require impartiality, but to proscribe arbitrators employed by or otherwise\nunder the control of one of the parties. Americo's argument is certainly plausible; the practice of\nappointing arbitrators who are somehow formally associated with the party appointing them is\nnot unheard of. See, e.g., Astoria, 227 N.Y.S.2d 401, 182 N.E.2d at 86 (party appointed “one of\nthe incorporators of [the company] and its president from 1950 to 1957” who was at the time “a\nmember of its board of directors and one of its paid consultants”); Hooters of Am., Inc. v. Phillips,\n173 F.3d 933, 939 (4th Cir.1999) (“Under the [terms of the arbitration agreement], Hooters is\nfree to devise lists of partial arbitrators who have existing relationships, financial or familial,\nwith Hooters and its management.”). Indeed, to prevent this practice, some arbitration agreements\nexpressly prohibit it. See, e.g., Burlington, 960 S.W.2d at 630 (“While [the arbitration agreements]\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  9\n\fAmerico Life, Inc. v. Myer, 440 S.W.3d 18 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 831\n\nprohibit the parties from selecting their own employees as arbitrators, [they] do not specify whether\nthe two arbitrators that the parties unilaterally selected ... would be neutral or would represent the\ninterests of the party appointing them.”).\n\nAdditional agreement terms lend support to Americo's interpretation. The agreement provides\nthat arbitrators “shall be entitled to retain a lawyer to advise them as to legal matters, but such\nlawyer shall have none of the relationships to Americo or Myer (or any of their Affiliates) that\nare proscribed above for arbitrators.” The only term that can be fairly read as a proscription of a\n“relationship” between a party and its chosen arbitrator is the requirement that all arbitrators be\n“independent” of the party appointing them. But it does not follow that an “independent” arbitrator\nmust also be impartial; indeed, an independent arbitrator could be partial or impartial. However,\nif we follow Myer's suggestion that “independent” is synonymous with “impartial,” it becomes\nunclear what “relationship” the agreement is attempting to proscribe. Impartiality is a state of\nmind, but “independent” necessarily refers to a relationship—the subject is free from someone\nor something.\n\n *24 The industry norm for tripartite arbitrators when the parties executed their agreement was\nthat party-appointed arbitrators were advocates, and the AAA rules in place at that time presumed\nsuch arbitrators would not be impartial unless the parties specifically agreed otherwise. Given\nthe pervasiveness of the practice, and the clear AAA presumption the parties had to rebut, we\nbelieve the parties would have done more than require its arbitrators to be “independent” if they\nwished them to be impartial. “Independent” and “impartial” are not interchangeable in this context,\nand therefore we conclude the parties did not intend to require impartiality of party-appointed\narbitrators.\n\n\n\n                                                      B\n\n [11] Having concluded the terms of the agreement do not require impartial party-appointed\narbitrators, we turn to the effect of the incorporated-by-reference AAA rules on arbitrator\nqualifications. There is no dispute the AAA rules would govern matters on which the agreement is\nsilent. The question is whether AAA rules on arbitrator qualifications can, as the court of appeals\nconcluded, supplement terms agreed on by the parties that specifically speak to the same point.\n\nThe court of appeals reasoned that the rules and the agreement “can be read together and\nharmonized to avoid any irreconcilable conflict.” Myer v. Americo Life, Inc., 371 S.W.3d 537, 543\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2012). In other words, because “impartial” could be added without negating any\nexpressly chosen qualifications, it was proper to do so to effectuate all the agreement's provisions.\nBut this cannot be the end of our inquiry, or the specifically chosen terms of any agreement would\nbe hopelessly open-ended whenever outside rules are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 831\n\n\n\n [12] When an arbitration agreement incorporates by reference outside rules, “the specific\nprovisions in the arbitration agreement take precedence and the arbitration rules are incorporated\nonly to the extent that they do not conflict with the express provisions of the arbitration agreement.”\nSzuts v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 931 F.2d 830, 832 (11th Cir.1991). The Federal Arbitration\nAct, which the parties agree governs their agreement, requires that if an agreement provides “a\nmethod of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, such method shall\nbe followed.” 9 U.S.C. § 5. Similarly, the AAA rules in effect when the parties executed their\nagreement, as well as when arbitration was invoked, both provide that “[i]f the agreement of the\nparties names an arbitrator or specifies a method of appointing an arbitrator, that designation or\nmethod shall be followed.” AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules § 14 (1996), R–12 (2003).\n\n [13] Any attempt to harmonize the AAA impartiality rule with the parties' expressly chosen\narbitrator qualifications misses the point. We do not construe “conflict” between an agreement\nand incorporated rules so narrowly as to find it exists only if the rule contradicts the agreement. A\nconflict can exist when an agreement and incorporated rules speak to the same point. Even if both\ncan be followed without contradiction, they conflict because the parties have already addressed the\nmatter and are not in need of gap-filling from the AAA rules. When the agreement and incorporated\nrules speak to the same point, the agreement's voice is the only to be heard.\n\nHere, the parties chose a short list of arbitrator qualifications, and in doing so we must assume\nthey spoke comprehensively. The parties chose “knowledgeable” and “independent” but not\n“impartial,” and we think they meant not only what they *25 said but also what they did not\nsay. See CKB & Assocs. v. Moore McCormack Petroleum, Inc., 734 S.W.2d 653, 655 (Tex.1987)\n(expressio unius est exclusio alterius—the naming of one thing excludes another). And though\nwe can concede the parties embraced some uncertainty by adopting AAA rules that were subject\nto change, we cannot conceive that they agreed to be bound by rules that would alter the express\nterms of their agreement. Nor can we imagine they took the trouble to expressly agree on some\nterms if their decision to incorporate AAA rules would leave those terms open to alteration. The\nAAA impartiality rule conflicts with the parties' agreement because the parties spoke on the matter\nand did not choose impartiality. When such a conflict arises, the agreement controls. Szuts, 931\nF.2d at 832.\n\n***\n\nBecause the AAA disqualified Americo's first-choice arbitrator for partiality, the arbitration panel\nwas formed contrary to the express terms of the arbitration agreement. The panel, therefore,\nexceeded its authority when it resolved the parties' dispute. See City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d\nat 20; I.S. Joseph Co., 803 F.2d at 399. Because the arbitrators exceeded their authority, the\narbitration award must be vacated. See 9 U.S.C. § 10(a); Bulko, 450 F.3d at 625. Accordingly, we\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 831\n\nreverse the court of appeals' judgment and reinstate the trial court's order vacating the arbitration\naward.\n\n\n\nJustice JOHNSON filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice WILLETT, Justice LEHRMANN\nand Justice BOYD joined.\n\n\nJustice JOHNSON, joined by Justice WILLETT, Justice LEHRMANN, and Justice BOYD,\ndissenting.\nThe parties in this case agreed to arbitrate disputes regarding Robert Myer's sale of life\ninsurance companies to Americo for tens of millions of dollars, and agreed that the arbitration\nproceedings would be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (AAA). When this dispute arose and Myer challenged the\nfirst two arbitrators appointed by Americo, the AAA disqualified them. Americo protested\nthe disqualification of the first arbitrator it appointed, reserved the right to challenge his\ndisqualification, eventually named an arbitrator who was not disqualified, and arbitrated. After\ncompletion of the arbitration, Americo sought to have the trial court vacate the award. The court\ndid so on the basis that the AAA improperly disqualified Americo's first appointed arbitrator, the\npanel was improperly constituted, and the award was void. The court of appeals reversed and\nremanded.\n\nThe Court holds that the trial court did not err by voiding the arbitration award because in their\nagreement (the trailer agreement) the parties established the exclusive qualifications and selection\nmethod for arbitrators. I agree with the court of appeals that the trailer agreement and provisions of\nthe AAA rules which the parties specifically agreed would govern any arbitration proceedings are\nunambiguous, can be harmonized, and both can be given effect. Accordingly, the parties should\nbe bound by the arbitrator selection provisions of both, as they agreed.\n\nMyer sold multiple insurance companies to Americo. In 1998 they entered into a trailer agreement\ncontaining the following provisions regarding disputes:\n\n   3.3 Arbitration. In the event of any dispute arising after the date of this Agreement among\n   the parties herein with reference to any transaction contemplated *26 by this Agreement, the\n   same shall be referred to three arbitrators. Americo shall appoint one arbitrator and Myer shall\n   appoint one arbitrator and such two arbitrators to select the third.... Each arbitrator shall be a\n   knowledgeable, independent businessperson or professional.\n\n   ...\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 831\n\n\n   The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration\n   rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that Americo and Myer each shall be\n   entitled to take discovery as provided under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Nos. 28 through\n   36 during a period of 90 days after the final arbitrator is appointed and the arbitrators shall have\n   the power to issue subpoenas, compel discovery, award sanctions and grant injunctive relief.\n   The arbitrators shall be entitled to retain a lawyer to advise them as to legal matters, but such\n   lawyer shall have none of the relationships to Americo or Myer (or any of their Affiliates) that\n   are proscribed above for arbitrators.\n\nDisputes arose, Americo demanded arbitration in 2005, and each party appointed an arbitrator.\nMyer objected to Ernest Figari, the arbitrator appointed by Americo. In its letter to the AAA\nabout Figari, Myer protested that the parties “have not agreed to the appointment of a non-neutral\narbitrator in this proceeding, and [Myer] requires that any arbitrator must qualify as an impartial\nand independent arbitrator.” The AAA disqualified Figari as well as a second Americo appointee.\nFinally, Americo appointed the arbitrator who served on the panel. That panel eventually rendered\na unanimous award for Myer.\n\nThe trial court granted Americo's motion to set aside the award because the panel was improperly\nconstituted and the award was void. The court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law,\nsome of which were: (1) the arbitrator selection method in the AAA rules did not apply because\nthe parties agreed on specific procedures and standards for appointing arbitrators; (2) the AAA\nwas required to follow the procedures in the first paragraph of section 3.3 of the trailer agreement\nand it did not; and (3) the arbitrators were not required to be neutral or meet the “impartial and\nindependent” standard of the AAA rules.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed. Myer v. Americo Life, Inc., 371 S.W.3d 537, 542–46 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 2012, pet. granted). It held that the trailer agreement was not ambiguous, the AAA rules\napplied to “proceedings” which included the arbitrator selection process, the arbitrator selection\nprocess complied with the trailer agreement and AAA rules that it specified, the applicable AAA\nrules required impartial arbitrators absent the parties' specific agreement otherwise, the parties did\nnot specifically agree otherwise, and the AAA did not disregard its own rules in disqualifying\nFigari. Id. I agree with the court of appeals' analyses and conclusions.\n\nI also agree with a great deal of what the Court says, and certainly with the authorities it cites\nfor fairly standard, unremarkable principles of contract interpretation. For example, I agree that\nthe language in the trailer agreement that requires arbitrators to be “independent” cannot be read\ninterchangeably with “impartial.” 440 S.W.3d 18, 21–22. I agree that in determining the intent of\nparties to an agreement we first and foremost, examine the express language of their agreement.\nId. at 22 (citing Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v.

Id. at 22 (citing Houston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting\nAgencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462, 469 (Tex.2011)). I agree that “[w]hen an arbitration agreement\nincorporates by reference outside rules, ‘the specific provisions in the arbitration agreement take\nprecedence and the arbitration rules are incorporated only to the extent that they do not conflict\nwith the express provisions of the arbitration agreement.’ ” Id. at 24 (quoting Szuts v. Dean Witter\nReynolds, Inc., 931 F.2d 830, 832 (11th Cir.1991)). But I view the Court, in the end, as giving\nonly lip service to those principles and authorities.\n\nThe Court says that the parties agreed to an arbitrator selection process and decided what\nqualifications their arbitrators must possess by specifying that each arbitrator must be a\n“knowledgeable, independent businessperson or professional.” 440 S.W.3d at 20. So far, so good.\nBut it then determines that the parties “spoke comprehensively,” by listing the requirements they\ndesired as to arbitrators. While acknowledging the parties also agreed that the AAA rules would\ngovern the proceedings, the Court draws two conclusions with which I disagree. The first is its\nresponse to the court of appeals' conclusion that the AAA rules and the trailer agreement can be\nread together and harmonized to avoid any irreconcilable conflict. The Court's response is\n\n             In other words, because [as the court of appeals held] impartiality could be added\n             without negating any expressly chosen qualifications, it was proper to do so\n             to effectuate all the agreement's provisions. But this cannot be the end of our\n             inquiry, or the specifically chosen terms of any agreement would be hopelessly\n             open-ended whenever outside rules are incorporated by reference.\n\nId. at 24 (emphasis added). The second conclusion with which I disagree is the Court's conclusion\nthat the AAA provisions as to arbitrator impartiality conflict with the parties' specific agreement\nbecause of the added impartiality requirement. Id. at 23–25.\n\nAs to the Court's concern of “hopelessly open-ended” terms in the agreement, the trailer agreement\nexecuted by these sophisticated parties specifies that each appointed arbitrator “shall be a\nknowledgeable, independent businessperson or professional.” But it also provides that the AAA\nrules apply to the proceedings. At the time the parties entered into the trailer agreement, the 1996\nAAA rules were in effect. Those rules specified that\n\n             The parties shall be deemed to have made these rules a part of their arbitration\n             agreement whenever they have provided for arbitration by the American\n             Arbitration Association (hereinafter AAA) or under its commercial Arbitration\n             Rules. These rules and any amendment of them shall apply in the form obtaining\n             at the time the demand for arbitration or submission agreement is received by\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fAmerico Life, Inc. v. Myer, 440 S.W.3d 18 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 831\n\n             the AAA. The parties, by written agreement, may vary the procedures set forth\n             in these rules.\n\nAAA Commercial Arbitration § 1 (1996) (emphasis added). That provision is not in the least\nambiguous or unclear. The parties could have, but did not, incorporate the 1996 rules into their\nagreement while excluding any amendments to the rules. Then their agreement would not have\nbeen “open-ended” as the Court describes it. Rather, the parties incorporated language specifying\nthat their disputes would be resolved according to whatever AAA rules were in effect when the\ndemand for arbitration was made. The Court's conclusion *28 that the parties could not have\nmeant exactly what they said because the terms of their agreement would “leave those terms open\nto alteration” is a judicial re-making of the parties' agreement. If the parties to a contract want its\nterms to be open to alteration, they are entitled to make it so. If they do not, they can make it so.\nBut whichever way they choose should be honored by the courts.\n\nAs to the Court's conclusion that there is a conflict between the arbitrator requirements in the trailer\nagreement and those in the AAA rules, there is no dispute that the 2003 AAA Rules apply. And\nas the court of appeals explained, the 2003 rules provide that when parties have agreed to each\nname an arbitrator, the standards of rule R–17 with respect to impartiality and independence will\napply unless the parties have “specifically agreed” that the arbitrators are to be non-neutral and do\nnot have to meet such standards. Myer, 371 S.W.3d at 543 (citing AAA Commercial Arbitration\nRule R–12(b) (2003)). Rule R–17 provides that\n\n             Any arbitrator shall be impartial and independent and shall perform his or her\n             duties with diligence and in good faith, and shall be subject to disqualification\n             for ... partiality or lack of independence.\n\nAAA Commercial Arbitration Rule R–17(a) (2003). The trailer agreement provides that arbitrators\nwill be knowledgeable, independent businesspeople or professionals. But Americo and Myer did\nnot “specifically agree” that the arbitrators would be non-neutral and need not meet the Rule R–\n17 standards. Therefore, in addition to the qualifications the parties set out in the first paragraph\nof section 3.3 of the trailer agreement, the parties also agreed that (1) the AAA arbitration rules\nin effect at the time arbitration was demanded would apply, and (2) pursuant to the 2003 rules\nthat were in effect when arbitration was demanded, the arbitrators would be impartial and perform\ntheir duties with diligence and good faith.\n\nThe Court concludes that the provisions in the trailer agreement and those in Rule R–17 conflict.\nIt reaches that conclusion by assuming that the parties listed in their separate agreement all\nthe requirements they desired of their arbitrators. But the trailer agreement language does not\nsupport such an assumption. To the contrary, the language of section 3.3 of the trailer agreement\ndemonstrates just the opposite—that when the parties intended to supplant, vary, or circumscribe\nthe provisions of the AAA rules, they knew exactly how to specifically do so:\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 831\n\n\n             The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the\n             commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, except\n             that Americo and Myer each shall be entitled to take discovery as provided\n             under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Nos. 28 through 36 during a period\n             of 90 days after the final arbitrator is appointed and the arbitrators shall have\n             the power to issue subpoenas, compel discovery, award sanctions and grant\n             injunctive relief.... (emphasis added)\n\nNeither section 3.3 of the trailer agreement listing the arbitrator requirements nor any other part\nof the trailer agreement includes language addressing, much less specifically providing for, non-\nneutral arbitrators. And courts should not “rewrite agreements to insert provisions parties could\nhave included.” Tenneco Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex.1996).\n\nFurther, contracts must be considered in their entirety, with all provisions harmonized, if possible,\nand all provisions given effect to the extent possible. FPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Mgmt.\nCo., *29 L.P., 426 S.W.3d 59, 63 (Tex.2014). “No single provision taken alone will be given\ncontrolling effect; rather, all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole\ninstrument.” Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983). By assuming the parties included\nall the arbitrator qualifications they desired in the trailer agreement, the Court confounds the intent\nof the parties as unambiguously expressed by the words they used in their agreement and the\nprovisions of the AAA rules they incorporated into their agreement. That assumption leads the\nCourt to determine that the trailer agreement and the AAA rules conflict when in reality they can\nbe harmonized as our extensive contract interpretation precedent requires.\n\nIn the end the Court misses the mark: the parties' unambiguous agreement and AAA Rule R–17\nrequiring arbitrator impartiality can be harmonized, and the parties did not expressly agree that\nthe arbitrators could be non-neutral as they were required to do if they intended to negate the\napplicable AAA rules requiring impartiality. The parties were entitled to make whatever agreement\nthey chose, open to alteration or not. Because the provisions of the trailer agreement and Rule\nR–17 can be harmonized, the provisions of both can be given effect. The provisions require the\narbitrators to be impartial.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Because the Court does not, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n440 S.W.3d 18, 57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 831\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They began renovating the home in May 2000. The renovations continued\ninto the year 2002 and were not completed by the time of trial. Furthermore, much of the work\nwas done by Don Beckham himself, and during their construction, the Beckhams left materials,\nsupplies, equipment, and trash on the property. Various other residents of the subdivision\ncomplained about this to the Association. The latter, in response, requested the Beckhams to clean\ntheir property. They did not but rather continued with their construction.\n\nThe renovations included excavation of the land at the rear of the house and the erection of a\npatio. Apparently, the floor of the patio served as the ceiling of a 1000 square foot space that the\nBeckhams were finishing to resemble the first floor of a three story home. Also erected below the\npatio but next to this 1000 square foot area was a small brick and windowed edifice. Other items\nwere also built on the property. They included a retaining wall that eventually had to be replaced\nand a metal tower standing higher than the roof of the home. The tower was to be used to receive\nhigh definition television signals from Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Association eventually sued the Beckhams for nuisance and to enforce various of the\nrestrictive covenants. Initially, the Beckhams chose to represent themselves and answered the\npetition with a general denial. Later, requests for admissions were served upon them, which\nrequests they failed to answer in a timely manner. And, though they attempted to relieve\nthemselves of the effect of their omission, the trial court struck only three of the deemed\nadmissions.\n\nEventually, the Beckhams retained counsel when they were served with a motion for summary\njudgment filed by the Association. They also later sought an extension of time to respond to the\nmotion. The extension was granted, and the summary judgment was subsequently denied. The case\nwas then tried to a jury. The latter held for the Beckhams, and judgment was eventually entered\nreflecting that verdict.\n\n\n\n                      Issue 1-Late Response to Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nIn its first issue, the Association complains of the trial court's decision to extend the time in which\nthe Beckhams had to respond to its motion for summary judgment. We overrule the point.\n\nAn appellate court cannot review an order overruling a motion for summary judgment via appeal\nafter a conventional trial on the merits. Motor 9, Inc. v. World Tire Corp., 651 S.W.2d 296, 299\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     2\n\fCommunity Imp. Ass'n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n(Tex.App.-Amarillo 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Given this, the fact that the trial court at bar overruled\nthe motion for summary judgment, and the fact that a conventional trial on the merits has been\nheld, any question about the validity of the trial court's decision to extend the deadline at issue is\neffectively moot or irrelevant. This is so because to afford the first issue any meaning or effect\nwould require us to also decide whether the extension affected the trial court's decision to deny\nthe summary judgment motion. Yet, because we cannot review the decision to deny the motion,\nit does not matter if the trial court legitimately afforded the Beckhams more time to respond to\nthe motion. So, we overrule the first issue.\n\n\n\n                                 Issue 2-Striking of Deemed Admissions\n\n*2 In its second issue, the Association argues that the trial court erred in striking three of the 38\ndeemed admissions made by the Beckhams. We overrule the issue.\n\nThe Beckhams failed to respond to admissions served on them. Consequently, they were deemed\nadmitted against them. However, upon their motion, the trial court struck three of the admissions.\nThe three involved were:\n35. You knowingly violated the Deed Restrictions.\n\n36. You willfully violated the Deed Restrictions.\n\n37. All of the facts contained in Plaintiff's First Amended Original Petition are true and correct.\n\n\nAccording to the Association, the trial court erred in permitting their amendment or withdrawal\nbecause the Beckhams failed to show good cause to justify the action. Yet, other than simply\nmentioning Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 198.3 in general, the Association provided us with\nno legal authority discussing the concept of good cause or illustrating why the reasons proffered by\nthe Beckhams to justify their omission failed to satisfy the applicable standard. This falls short of\ncomplying with the requirements of Rule 38.1(h) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. The\nlatter obligates an appellant to include within its argument “appropriate citations to authorities....”\nSince the Association did not do so, it waived its complaint. See State Farm Lloyds, Inc. v.\nWilliams, 960 S.W .2d 781, 789 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1997, pet. dism'd by agr.) (holding that the\nfailure to cite to supporting authority waives the issue).\n\n\n\n                                      Issues 3, 4, 5 and 12-Nuisance\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nIssues three, four, five, and twelve involve the question of nuisance. Through them, the Association\nattacks the trial court's 1) refusal to grant it a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the\nverdict on the issue and 2) refusal to exclude pictures depicting the condition of other parcels of\nproperty in the subdivision. We sustain the issues.\n\nThe deed restrictions at issue provided:\n         No noxious or offensive trade or activity shall be carried on or maintained on any\n         lot in said subdivision, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become\n         a nuisance in the neighborhood. A nuisance shall include but not be limited to: a\n         truck larger than three-quarter ton parked on lots or roads or permanently kept on\n         property; any motor vehicle not properly licensed by the State of Texas; junk or\n         wrecking yards; automobiles, trucks or other vehicles used for parts.\n\n\nMoreover, the Beckhams admitted that the construction material, supplies, equipment, trash and\ndebris “located on [their] property for more than 6 months ... created a nuisance,” “a dangerous\ncondition,” “a threat to the health and safety of [their] neighbors,” “a threat to the health and\nsafety of [their] neighbors' children,” and “a threat to the health and safety of the community of\nLake Conroe Hills subdivision as a whole.” 1 These admissions wrought a two-fold effect. First,\nbeing classified as judicial in nature, the admissions prevented the Beckhams from offering any\nevidence at trial that contradicted them. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887,\n905 (Tex.2000); Marshall v. Vise, 767 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Tex.1989). Second, they also relieved\nthe trial court from the obligation of submitting an issue to the jury on the topic. Horizon/CMS\nHealthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 905.\n\n *3 Thus, to the extent that the trial court admitted the pictures alluded to above “for the purposes\nof ... the question of nuisance,” it erred. Simply put, the Beckhams were prohibited from tendering\nevidence that contradicted their admission that they created a nuisance. Horizon/CMS Healthcare\nCorp. v. Auld, supra; Marshall v. Vise, supra. And, since they were barred from tendering it, the\ntrial court could not admit it.\n\nMoreover, having admitted the existence of a nuisance, the Beckhams were not entitled to the\nsubmission of, nor was the Association obligated to request, a jury issue on the matter. Horizon/\nCMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, supra. Rather, the circumstance afforded the trial court no avenue\nother than to direct a verdict finding that a nuisance existed. Simply put, the admissions resolved\nany factual dispute regarding, and established the Association's right to, judgment as a matter of\nlaw on the claim. See Rudolph v. ABC Pest Control, Inc,. 763 S.W.2d 930, 932 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 1989, writ denied) (stating that a directed verdict is proper if the evidence conclusively\nproves facts that establish a party's right to judgment as a matter of law).\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nFinally, we conclude that the errors were harmful. This is so because the jury determined that no\nnuisance arose, and judgment was entered on that verdict. Had it not been for the errors, the jury\ncould not have had the opportunity to so rule.\n\n\n\n                                 Issues 6, 7, 8, and 11-Erection of Tower\n\nThe next issues which we address, namely six, seven, eight, and eleven, involve the erection of\nthe metal tower. Through them, the Association argues that the trial court erred when it refused\nto 1) direct a verdict or grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict finding that the construction\nof the tower without advance approval from the Association violated the deed restrictions and\n2) submit a jury instruction informing the jurors that the words “building” and “structure” were\nsynonymous. It is also contended that the jury's verdict that said construction did not violate the\nrestrictions lacks evidentiary support. We overrule each point.\n\nThe particular restriction in dispute is found in paragraph “1” of the document and provides that:\n         No building shall be erected, placed or altered on any lot, property or area in\n         this subdivision until the building plans, specifications and plot plans showing\n         the location of such building have been approved in writing by LAKE CONROE\n         HILLS LIMITED, or its designated representative, or such architectural control\n         committee as may be established, as to conformity and harmony of external and\n         structural design and quality with existing structures in the subdivision and as to\n         the location of the building and in conformity with the declarations, reservations,\n         protective covenants, limitations, conditions and restrictions, as hereinafter set out.\n\n\n(Emphasis added). Given the wording utilized in paragraph 1, we must first conclude that the tower\nconstituted a building before we can sustain the Association's issues. This we cannot do.\n\n *4 Deed restrictions are subject to the same rules of interpretation applicable to contracts. Pilarcik\nv. Emmons, 966 S.W.2d 474, 478 (Tex.1998). So, when construing them, we strive to give effect\nto the parties' intent as garnered from the document as a whole and the words used in it. Cross\nTimbers Oil Co. v. Exxon Corp, 22 S .W.3d 24, 26 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2000, no pet.). We must\nalso afford those words their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning, unless the document\nrequires otherwise. Id.; see Air Park-Dallas Zoning Committee v. Crow Billingsley Airpark, Ltd.,\n109 S.W.3d 900, 909 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003, no pet.) (stating that words in a restrictive covenant\nwill be given their commonly accepted meaning). With this said, we turn to the words before us.\n\nThe term “building” commonly denotes “a structure” having “a roof and walls.” Webster's\nRevised Unabridged Dictionary (1998). On the other hand, the word “structure” usually denotes\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     5\n\fCommunity Imp. Ass'n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n“something ... that is constructed” or “arranged in a definite pattern.” Id. Given this, one can\nreadily see that though the two words may be related, they are not the same. While a building\ncan be considered a structure for it is “something that is constructed” and “arranged in a definite\npattern,” not everything that can be built in a definite pattern is a building. For instance, the water\nfountain appearing at the entrance of Texas Tech University is unquestionably constructed and\nmost definitely arranged in a certain pattern but it has no walls or roof. So, while one could\nreasonably consider it a structure, it could hardly be deemed a building. And, this leads us to hold\nthat the words “structure” and “building” are not per se synonymous.\n\nFurthermore, our holding is further supported by the deed restrictions themselves. In paragraph\n3(G) of same there appears the following:\n         Except for townhouses and multi-family dwellings ... no building or structure shall\n         be erected on any lot nearer than four ... feet including roof overhang from an\n         interior lot line....\n\n\n(Emphasis added). As can be seen, both the words “building” and “structure” are used. What\nmakes this significant is the rule requiring us to give meaning to every word contained in the\ndocument. Cherokee Water Co. v. Freeman, 33 S.W.3d 349, 354 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2000, no\npet.) (stating that the court is required to give effect to all words used and is not permitted to assume\nthat the drafter intended some words to have no effect). Yet, if we were to adopt the Association's\nargument that the two words mean the same thing, we would effectively be rendering one or the\nother redundant, that is, we would be violating the rule expressed in Freeman. So, due to the fact\nthat the individual who drafted the restrictions included both words in the paragraph, authority\ncompels us to presume that the drafter intended the words have different meanings.\n\nIn view of our foregoing observations, we cannot but find that the trial court acted properly in\nrefusing to instruct the jury that “building” and “structure” meant the same thing. 2 Nor can one\nwho sees the pictures of the metal tower contained in the record deny that the item lacked both walls\nand a roof. And, because it lacked such characteristics, it was within the province of the jury to\nconclude that the tower was not a “building” as that term is commonly understood. Consequently,\nthe trial court had basis upon which to refuse to submit the instruction sought by the Association,\nand some evidence existed to support the jury's finding that the Beckhams did not violate paragraph\n1 by failing to obtain approval as a condition precedent to erecting the tower.\n\n\n\n                                   Issues 9 and 10-Construction Period\n\n *5 In their ninth and tenth issues, the Association complains of a partial directed verdict granted\nin favor of the Beckhams. Through it, the trial court found that the six-month construction period\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       6\n\fCommunity Imp. Ass'n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nmentioned in paragraph 3(J) of the deed restrictions only applied to new construction, as opposed to\nalterations or additions to an existing residence. And, since the Beckhams were simply modifying\nan existing home, the trial court refused to ask the jury if the Beckhams violated 3(J) and instead\ndirected a verdict on the matter. We sustain the Association's ninth issue and overrule the tenth.\n\nParagraph 3(J) provides:\n         CONSTRUCTION. All materials used in the exterior construction of any residence\n         or other structure must be approved by Lake Conroe Hills Limited or its assigns or\n         nominees before any structure may be erected and only new construction materials\n         may be used except for used brick. No concrete blocks shall be used in said\n         construction and all buildings shall be built on a slab or solid concrete beam\n         foundation or standing on concrete blocks. In no event shall any old house or\n         building be moved on any lot or lots in said subdivision. The exterior construction\n         of any kind and character, be it the primary residence, garage, porches, or\n         appendages thereto, shall be completed within six (6) months after the start of\n         foundation.\n\n\n(Emphasis added). As can be seen, nothing in the provision expressly limits the application of the\nitalicized sentence to new construction. Moreover, the plain wording of that sentence belies any\nnotion that the restriction merely encompasses only the construction of new houses. Indeed, we\ncannot ignore the fact that the person who drafted the restrictions used the phrase “of any kind and\ncharacter” to describe the type of exterior construction subject to the six-month period. Simply put,\nexterior construction “of any kind and character” is all encompassing. And, that the person who\ndrafted the deed restrictions may have referred to the alteration of existing structures elsewhere in\nthe document but omitted the term in the italicized sentence does not convince us otherwise. This\nis due to the inherent breadth of the word “any.” “Any” means, in the context before us, “all.” So,\nwhen exterior construction “of any kind and character” must be completed within six months, the\npassage cannot reasonably be read as meaning only “some” types of construction.\n\nMoreover, to adopt the Beckhams' interpretation of the phrase would lead to an absurd result. For\ninstance, those building a new home would have to complete the exterior within six months. Yet,\nif one sought to make extensive additions or alterations to the exterior of an existing house (e.g.\nadditions increasing the size of the house two-fold) he could take as many years as he chose to\nfinish the job and, consequently, keep the external appearance of his property in unsightly disarray\nas long as he chose. That makes no sense, and we cannot accord an absurd meaning to the words\nof a document. Criswell v. European Crossroads Shopping Center, Ltd., 792 S.W.2d 945, 948\n(Tex.1990).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n *6 In sum, we find that the six-month restriction was not intended to apply and cannot reasonably\nbe read as applying only to the construction of a new house. Instead, it encompassed additions\nand alterations to the exterior of an existing house. And, since the record indisputably revealed\nthat the Beckhams failed to complete the exterior portion of the alterations to their home within\nsix months of their initiation, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Beckhams\non the matter. This very same indisputable evidence also leads us to conclude that there was no\nneed to ask the jury if the deed restriction had been violated. Again, a jury need not be asked about\nissues which involve no factual dispute. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, supra. Thus, we\nreject the Association's contention that such an issue had to be submitted to the jury. Finally, we\nhold that the error committed viz the partial directed verdict was harmful since it deprived the\nAssociation of opportunity to recover upon one of its claims.\n\n\n\n                              Issue 13-Civil Damages and Attorney's Fees\n\nIn its final issue, the Association asserts that the trial court erred in failing to award it civil damages\nand attorney's fees. We sustain the issue.\n\nA court may assess civil damages for the violation of a restrictive covenant in an amount not to\nexceed $200 for each day of the violation. TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 202.004(c) (Vernon 1995).\nHowever, since the language of the statute is permissive in nature, the award of such damages is\nleft to the trial court's discretion. Air Park-Dallas Zoning Committee v. Crow-Billingsley Air Park,\nLtd., 109 S.W.3d at 912. At bar, the trial court did not consider the assessment of civil damages\nbecause the jury found there was no violation of the deed restrictions. Since we have determined\nthat the six-month time period in paragraph 3(J) of the restrictions was violated, the case should\nbe remanded for a determination of the civil damages to be awarded, if any.\n\nNext, the award of attorney's fees is not discretionary. Instead, the legislature stated that the trial\ncourt “shall allow [attorney's fees] to a prevailing party who asserted” an action for breach of\na restrictive covenant pertaining to realty. TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 5.006(a) (Vernon 2004).\nNevertheless, it lies within the trial court's bailiwick to determine the reasonableness of the fees\nfor we cannot find facts. Briargrove Park Property Owners, Inc. v. Riner, 867 S.W.2d 58, 62\n(Tex.App.-Texarkana 1993, writ denied). Therefore, we must remand the issue of attorney's fees\nto the trial court as well.\n\nIn summary, we reverse the judgment to the extent it denies the Association recovery upon its claim\nof nuisance and the claim involving the violation of paragraph 3(J) of the deed restrictions and\nrender judgment in favor of the Association upon those two claims. We next reverse and remand\nthat portion of the judgment denying the Association damages and attorney's fees and awarding\nthe Beckhams their costs of court. In all other things, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                        8\n\fCommunity Imp.

There, the restrictions contained the word “structure,” and the court held that a radio tower was a\n       “structure.” Id. at 43.

Silva, 75 S.W.3d 1 (2001)\n\n\n\nGregorio Cervantes, individually and as legal heir for the use and benefit of all persons entitled\nto recover for the wrongful death of Humberto Javier Cervantes Calzoncin (collectively, the\nplaintiffs).\n\nDefendants bring three issues on appeal: the trial court erred in (1) holding the policy provided\ncoverage, (2) allowing plaintiffs' expert to testify about the meaning of the policy, and (3) refusing\nto apply res judicata to bar plaintiffs' claims. We agree that the policy does not provide coverage\nfor the plaintiffs' claims; therefore, we reverse and render judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nNon-party Texas Recreation Corporation (“TRC”) is a Texas company that manufactures pool\nequipment. TRC contracted with TRC International to manufacture certain products in Mexico,\nand TRC provided equipment to TRC International, including heaters with open flames. The\ndefendants were TRC's insurers. During the pendency of the insurance policy, a fire at the Mexico\nplant killed a number of employees, including plaintiffs' decedents. TRC made a demand on the\ndefendants for defense and indemnity, and defendants denied coverage.\n\nIn 1992, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against TRC and TRC International in Maverick\nCounty, Texas district court. In May 1993, defendants sued TRC and plaintiffs in federal court,\nseeking a declaration of non-coverage in the wrongful death suit. Service was attempted on\nplaintiffs' lawyer, who refused service. In September 1993, TRC filed for bankruptcy protection.\nIn January 1995, plaintiffs obtained a judgment against TRC. In September 1995, the federal\ncourt ruled that *3 defendants had no duty to defend or indemnify TRC. This judgment was later\naffirmed by the Fifth Circuit. In January 1996, TRC assigned to plaintiffs “any and all claims,\ndemands, and causes of action they have against Defendants.” In December 1997, plaintiffs sued\nthe defendants in Maverick County district court to collect on the wrongful death judgment. After\na bench trial, the court found in favor of plaintiffs and awarded judgment for the full amount of\nthe insurance policy, plus prejudgment interest.\n\n\n\n                                        “POLICY TERRITORY”\n\nIn their first issue on appeal, defendants assert the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiffs'\nclaims in the wrongful death action arose within the “policy territory” as that phrase is used in\nthe policy.\n\n\nThe Policy\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fCommercial Union Assur. Co. PLC v. Silva, 75 S.W.3d 1 (2001)\n\n\n\nThe policy applies “only to bodily injury or property damage which occurs within the policy\nterritory.” “Policy territory” is defined as “(1) the United States of America, its territories or\npossessions, or Canada, or (2) international waters or air space, provided the bodily injury or\nproperty damage does not occur in the course of travel or transportation to or from any other\ncountry, state, or nation, or (3) anywhere in the world with respect to damages because of bodily\ninjury or property damage arising out of a product which was sold for use or consumption within\nthe territory described in paragraph (1) provided the original suit for damages is brought within\nsuch territory....” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe trial court found that a “reasonable construction of the definition of ‘policy territory’ is that\nboth prepositional phrases modify the verb ‘sold’ such that worldwide coverage applies if the\nproduct was (1) sold for use or consumption and (2) sold within the territory described in paragraph\n(1).” The court also found that “[c]onstruing the definition of ‘policy territory’ to require that the\nuse or consumption of the product occur within the United States would be contrary to the clear\nintent of the policy to expand coverage for bodily injury claims arising from a products hazard.”\nDefendants contend this interpretation is incorrect. Defendants assert the policy covers only\nproducts intended for use or consumption in the United States. Therefore, defendants conclude,\nan accident occurring in Mexico arising out of a product intended for use in Mexico is not within\nthe “policy territory,” and thus not covered.\n\n\nRules of construction\n [1] [2] [3] Insurance contracts are subject to the same rules of construction as other contracts.\nState Farm Life Ins. Co. v. Beaston, 907 S.W.2d 430, 433 (Tex.1995); National Union Fire Ins.\nCo. v. CBI Indus., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995); Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d\n132, 133 (Tex.1994). Our primary goal, therefore, is to give effect to the written expression of the\nparties' intent. Beaston, 907 S.W.2d at 433; Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 133. We must read all parts\nof the contract together, Beaston, 907 S.W.2d at 433, striving to give meaning to every sentence,\nclause, and word to avoid rendering any portion inoperative. United Serv. Auto. Ass'n v. Miles,\n139 Tex. 138, 161 S.W.2d 1048, 1050 (1942).\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Whether an insurance policy is ambiguous is a legal question decided\nby examining the entire contract in light of the circumstances present when the parties entered\ninto the contract. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Vaughan, 968 S.W.2d 931, 933 (Tex.1998). A\npolicy is not ambiguous, as a matter of law, if the court can give it a definite legal meaning. Id.\nAn ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting interpretations. *4\nForbau, 876 S.W.2d at 134. A contract is ambiguous if, after applying these rules, it is subject\nto two or more reasonable interpretations. National Union, 907 S.W.2d at 520. If the policy is\nsubject to more than one reasonable interpretation, we must adopt the construction most favorable\nto the insured when we resolve the uncertainty. Vaughan, 968 S.W.2d at 933. Where an ambiguity\ninvolves an exclusionary provision of an insurance policy, we “must adopt the construction ...\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Silva, 75 S.W.3d 1 (2001)\n\n\n\nurged by the insured as long as that construction is not unreasonable, even if the construction urged\nby the insurer appears to be more reasonable or a more accurate reflection of the parties' intent.”\nNational Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Hudson Energy Co., 811 S.W.2d 552, 555 (Tex.1991). An insurer\nwho relies on an exclusion carries the burden to prove that it applies. TEX. INS.CODE ANN. art.\n21.58(b) (Vernon Supp.2001).\n\n\nAnalysis\n [10] Plaintiffs argue that the definition of “policy territory” places two limitations upon the\ninsured's actions in selling its product in order for coverage to exist for product claims arising\noutside the country. The first limitation, on the nature of the sale, requires that the product must be\n“sold for use or consumption.” The second limitation, on the location of the sale, requires that the\nsale occur within the United States, its territories or possessions, or Canada. Plaintiffs conclude that\n“within the territory described” modifies both “sold” and “for use and consumption.” We disagree.\n\nPlaintiffs' reading grammatically strains the language, because it reads the adverbial phrase as\nmodifying the distant verb “sold” rather than the prepositional phrase “for use or consumption”\nimmediately preceding it. Moreover, this reading renders “for use or consumption” as surplusage,\nas there would be coverage for any sale in the United States or Canada, regardless of where the\nproduct sold was used or consumed. Therefore, we hold that the policy is not ambiguous and the\nphrase “within the territory described” modifies “for use or consumption” and not “sold.” See\ngenerally Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Truck Ins. Exch., 797 F.2d 1288 (5th Cir.1986); Vinocur's Inc.\nv. CNA Ins. Co., 132 A.D.2d 543, 517 N.Y.S.2d 277 (N.Y.App.Div.1987). 1 Here, the products\nwere sold for use in the manufacturing plant operated by T.R.C. International S.A. de C.V. in\nMexico; thus, the policy does not provide coverage for plaintiffs' claims.\n\n\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\nBecause we hold that the policy does not provide coverage for the plaintiffs' claims, we do not\naddress defendants' second and third issues on appeal. We reverse the trial court's judgement and\nrender a take-nothing judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n75 S.W.3d 1\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 448th District\nCourt, El Paso County, Susan Larsen, J., granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and\nparticipant appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Guadalupe Rivera, J., held that:\n\n[1] summary judgment affidavit of participant's surgeon was insufficient to controvert school\ndistrict and health plan administrator's medical expert's opinion that subsequent revision surgeries\nto remove excess skin was not encompassed by settlement agreement;\n\n[2] letter from medical expert did not create an inference that participant's need for additional\nsurgeries were due to complications from earlier surgeries;\n\n[3] medical expert's opinion was admissible to explain meaning of term “complication” in parties'\nsettlement agreement; and\n\n[4] and affirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata were not only\nrelevant to plan participant's breach of contract claim, but were also specifically tailored to that\nclaim in defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In six issues, Contreras attacks whether a material fact existed, whether\nthe submitted expert's opinion was relevant, and whether Appellees were entitled to rely on their\naffirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nOn July 8, 2003, Irma Contreras had gastric bypass surgery, which Appellees paid for. She then\nlost over one hundred pounds, prompting Dr. Dale Reynolds to recommend that Contreras undergo\nfive surgical procedures, which he believed were medically necessary, that consisted of excision\nof excessive skin and subcutaneous tissues of the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, breasts, and arms.\nAppellees, however, refused to pay for those surgeries, claiming that they were cosmetic. In\nresponse, Contreras sued Appellees for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and engaging\nin unfair settlement practices.\n\nAfter much negotiation, the parties settled the dispute and signed a settlement agreement.\nAccording to the terms of the agreement, Appellees agreed to pay the costs for the five surgeries\nrecommended by Dr. Reynolds, including a sixth surgery for lipectomy, and any complications\nresulting therefrom. The settlement agreement also stated that in consideration for the sums paid\nby Appellees, Contreras would release, acquit and forever discharge Appellees from any and all\nclaims, demands, and causes of actions growing out of, resulting from, or connected in any way\nwith those claims constituting the subject matter of the lawsuit. In addition, Contreras executed\nan Agreed Order of Dismissal with prejudice for her causes of action against Appellees.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 1188\n\n *416 Six months after receiving the surgeries listed in the settlement agreement, Dr. Miller\ninformed Contreras that an additional four revision surgeries were needed due to skin laxity. Those\nsurgeries included revision of excess skin of the thigh, revision of excision of excess skin of the\nleft arm, revision of excess skin of the abdomen, and revision of suction assisted lipectomy of the\ntrunk. And on March 9, 2007, Dr. Miller performed ten surgical procedures for skin laxity, which\nhe believed were medically necessary. However, Appellees refused to pay for those procedures,\nclaiming that they were cosmetic and did not arise from complications from the previous surgeries.\n\nConsequently, on January 6, 2009, Contreras filed suit against Appellees, claiming breach of\ncontract. In essence, Contreras argued that her revision surgeries were complications arising\nfrom her previous surgeries, and therefore, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Appellees\nwere obligated to pay for them. In response, Appellees moved for summary judgment, alleging\naffirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata, and that they did not\nbreach the settlement agreement as Contreras' revision surgeries were not complications resulting\nfrom the previous surgeries. In support of their motion, Appellees attached a letter and affidavit by\nDr. Henderson, which opined that the revision surgeries performed were cosmetic in nature and\nwere not due to any complications resulting from the previous surgeries. Contreras responded to\nAppellees' motions for summary judgment by attaching an affidavit from Dr. Miller, which stated\nthat the surgeries were medically necessary. After entertaining arguments on the matter, the trial\ncourt granted Appellees' motion, finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be\nresolved.\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\nContreras now raises six issues for our review. Issue One alleges that a material fact existed as to\nwhether the revision surgeries resulted from previous surgical complications. Issues Two, Three,\nand Four challenge whether Appellees' summary-judgment evidence was legally sufficient to\ndefeat Contreras' breach-of-contract claim. And Issues Five and Six contest whether the trial court\nerred by granting summary judgment on Appellees' claims for accord and satisfaction, release, and\nres judicata. For the reasons discussed below, we find no merit in any of the issues raised.\n\n\n\n                                      Genuine Issue of Material Fact\n\n [1] In Issue One, Contreras asserts that the trial court erred by finding no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact existed concerning whether her revision surgeries were complications arising from\nher previous surgeries. According to Contreras, two items of evidence raised such material facts:\n(1) Dr. Miller's affidavit, which opined that the surgeries were medically necessary; and (2) Dr.\nHenderson's letter, which acknowledged that the doctors in his office perform revision surgical\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 1188\n\nprocedures at no cost “since [they] feel that [they] should have removed enough skin the first\ntime....” Relying on those two pieces of evidence, Contreras asserts that there is an inference that\nany leftover excess skin was a complication from the original surgeries, that is, that Dr. Miller\nfailed to remove enough skin the first time.\n\n\n\n                                              Standard of Review\n\nWe review de novo a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment. Valence\nOperating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005). When moving for summary judgment,\nthe movant *417 bears the burden of showing that no genuine issues of material fact exist and\nthat he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Nixon v. Mr. Prop.\nMgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex.1985). In determining whether there are disputed issues of\nmaterial fact, we take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant and indulge every reasonable\ninference in the nonmovant's favor. Nixon, 690 S.W.2d at 548–49. When the defendant moves\nfor summary judgment, he must conclusively negate at least one essential element of each of the\nplaintiff's causes of action or conclusively establish each element of an affirmative defense to be\nentitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d\n910, 911 (Tex.1997). The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to produce competent controverting\nsummary judgment evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact. Centeq Realty, Inc. v.\nSiegler, 899 S.W.2d 195, 197 (Tex.1995). If no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary\njudgment, therefore, should be granted as a matter of law. Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 797\n(Tex.2001).\n\n\n\n                                                   Application\n\nHere, Dr. Miller claimed that the revision surgeries were necessary to remove excess skin so\nthat Contreras' skin would not lose its elasticity. Thus, he concluded that “the revision surgeries\nperformed by me were medically necessary and not for cosmetic purposes.” However, the issue\nbefore the trial court was not whether the surgeries were medically necessary to achieve the\nobjective of reducing the amount of loose skin, but whether the surgeries were due to complications\narising out of the previous surgeries. Although the affidavit explained why Dr. Miller believed\nthe surgeries were medically necessary, it did not state that the necessity arose from medical\ncomplications from the previous surgeries. In short, Dr. Miller's affidavit did not controvert\nAppellees' medical expert's opinion, stating that the revision surgeries were not the result of any\ncomplications resulting from the previous surgeries.\n\n [2] Contreras also asserts that Dr. Henderson's letter provided an inference that her revision\nsurgeries were due to complications. Specifically, she points to Dr. Henderson's statements that\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 7\n\fContreras v. Clint Independent School Dist., 347 S.W.3d 413 (2011)\n271 Ed. Law Rep. 1188\n\nthe doctors in his office do such additional surgical procedures for patients at no cost “since we\nfeel that we should have removed enough skin the first time, so we would not have to go back to\nsurgery.” Thus, she alleges that had Dr. Miller removed enough excess skin during the previous\nsurgeries, she would not have had to undergo the additional surgeries.\n\nHowever, Dr. Henderson's letter never opined that additional excess skin is a complication from\nthe previous surgeries. Indeed, nothing in his letter opinion or affidavit establishes that loose\nskin is a complication from such a surgery. According to the definition of “complication,” which\nDr. Henderson provided to the trial court, a postoperative complication is a “hematoma, wound\nbreakdown or dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, stroke, infection or death.” Loose\nskin, according to the summary judgment record, has never been included within that category.\nThus, we decline, as did the trial court, to infer that Dr. Henderson's letter could establish that\nContreras' additional revision surgeries were due to surgical complications.\n\nIn summary, because Contreras produced no evidence controverting Appellees' expert evidence\nthat her revision surgeries were not due to complications, we hold that the trial court did not err by\nholding no material fact existed as to whether the *418 complained-of surgical procedures were\ncomplications encompassed by the settlement agreement. See Jordan v. Geigy Pharm., 848 S.W.2d\n176, 180 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1992, no pet.) (concluding that because appellant failed to meet\nappellee's summary-judgment proof with competent controverting evidence, summary judgment\nwas proper). Therefore, since Contreras could not prove that Appellees breached the settlement\nagreement, her breach-of-contract claim failed, and Appellees were entitled to summary judgment\nas a matter of law. See B & W Supply, Inc. v. Beckman, 305 S.W.3d 10, 16 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (stating that the “essential elements of a breach of contract claim are\n(1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff; (3)\nbreach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained as a result of the breach”); see\nalso Sci. Spectrum, 941 S.W.2d at 911 (stating that if the defendant conclusively negates at least\none essential element of the plaintiff's cause of action, he is entitled to summary judgment as a\nmatter of law). Issue One is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                               Legal Sufficiency\n\nContreras' next three issues challenge whether Appellees' summary-judgment evidence was legally\nsufficient to defeat Contreras' breach-of-contract claim. We apply the same standard of review as\ncited above for reviewing legal sufficiency challenges to motions for summary judgments. See\nIbrahim v. Young, 253 S.W.3d 790, 802 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2008, pet. denied). Of course, if the\nmovant's summary judgment proof is legally insufficient, the nonmovant need not even respond\nto it.

Law Rep. 1188\n\n\n\n\n                                 Was Dr. Henderson's Opinion Relevant?\n\nIn Issue Two, Contreras asserts that Dr. Henderson's affidavit is irrelevant to whether Appellees\nbreach the settlement agreement by refusing to pay for her revision surgeries. She argues that Dr.\nHenderson's opinion concerning whether insurance companies generally cover second revision\nsurgeries and whether Dr. Miller should be paid for such surgeries was not relevant to the meaning\nof the term “complication” as used in the settlement agreement. Rather, Contreras alleges that those\nstatements go to the interpretation of an insurance contract or to the standard of care governing Dr.\nMiller's ability to charge for the revision surgeries. They do not, according to Contreras, ascribe\na meaning to the term “complication” as that term is interpreted within the medical community\nand thus the settlement agreement.\n\n [3] [4] The parties did not define the term “complication” in the settlement agreement. Although\nextrinsic evidence is generally not admissible to vary the terms of an unambiguous agreement,\nextrinsic evidence may “be admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning consistent with\nthat to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to ‘interpret’ contractual terms.” Mescalero\nEnergy, Inc. v. Underwriters Indem. General Agency, Inc., 56 S.W.3d 313, 320 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (quoting National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus.,\nInc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 (Tex.1995)). And expert testimony may be useful in explaining the\ncommonly understood meaning in the industry of a specialized term. Mescalero, 56 S.W.3d at\n320. In medical cases, the general rule is that expert testimony is necessary to establish causation\nas to medical conditions laying outside the common knowledge and experience of jurors. *419\nGuevara v. Ferrer, 247 S.W.3d 662, 665 (Tex.2007). Therefore, whether complications arose from\nthe surgical procedures performed on Contreras and more specifically, whether excess skin is a\ncomplication from those previous surgeries, would require expert testimony as that is not within\nthe realm of lay knowledge and experience.\n\n [5] And here, Dr. Henderson did provide a medical definition of “complication” by stating that\na complication is a “hematoma, wound breakdown or dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, heart\nattack, stroke, infection or death.” As noted by Appellees, that definition is found on the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina's website. See After Surgery: Discomforts and Complications,\navailable at http://www.muschealth. com/gs/healthtopic.aspx?action=showpage&pageid=P01390\n(last visited Aug. 8, 2011). Moreover, Dr. Henderson opined that Contreras' loose skin was not\na complication arising from the surgical procedures performed. These are not matters within\nthe realm of lay knowledge and experience. In other words, Dr. Henderson's definition of\n“complication,” as that term is interpreted within the medical community, was relevant to give\nthe settlement term a meaning consistent with that to which it was reasonably susceptible, and\nwe cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by accepting Dr. Henderson's definition\nof complication. See XCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622, 629 n. 4 (Tex.App.-\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  9\n\fContreras v.

Law Rep. 1188\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (determining that expert tax lawyer's interpretation of\nterms in partnership agreement was admissible to explain their specialized meaning); Presswood v.\nGoehring, No. 01–04–00134–CV, 2005 WL 1365188, at *3 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2005,\nno pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (noting that medical terminology is unfamiliar\nto laypersons). Issue Two is overruled.\n\n\n\n          Was Dr. Henderson's Opinion Free from Contradiction and Inconsistencies?\n\nIn Issue Three, Contreras contends that the trial court erred by not excluding Dr. Henderson's\naffidavit for the reasons that it was controverted, that it addressed a subject matter for which\nthe trier of fact did not need to be guided by an expert, and that it was not clear, positive, and\ndirect, or free from contradictions and inconsistencies. See Anderson v. Snider, 808 S.W.2d 54, 55\n(Tex.1991) (per curiam) (summary judgment may be granted on the “uncontroverted testimony of\nan expert witness if the subject matter is such that a trier of fact would be ‘guided solely by the\nopinion testimony of experts, if the evidence is clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and\nfree from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted’ ”) (quoting\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c)). However, we have already determined that Dr. Miller's affidavit did not\ncontrovert Dr. Henderson's opinion, and that expert medical testimony was necessary to establish\nthe meaning of “complication” within the settlement agreement; thus, we do not address these\narguments further. Moreover, we decline to address Contreras' third argument, namely, whether\nDr. Henderson's affidavit was free from contradictions and inconsistencies, finding the same to\nbe inadequately briefed.\n\nThe Rules of Appellate Procedure require the briefing party to provide a legal argument and\nauthorities that support that argument to maintain the point at issue. See Tex.R.App. P. 38.1; Dodge\nv. Dodge, 314 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2010, no pet.); Ratsavong v. Menevilay, 176\nS.W.3d 661, 666 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2005, pet. denied), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 886, 127 S.Ct. 253,\n166 L.Ed.2d 149 (2006). This is not done by merely uttering brief conclusory *420 statements,\nunsupported by analogous legal authority. Dodge, 314 S.W.3d at 85.\n\nHere, Contreras asserts in three conclusory sentences that Dr. Henderson's opinion that her\nrevision surgeries were not to treat complications contradicted his earlier statements that insurance\ncompanies may consider skin laxity a medical problem as it can result in yeast, fungal, and\nbacterial infections. She does not provide any argument explaining how the statements render the\naffidavit inconsistent, nor does she cite to authority holding such statements create inconsistencies.\nAccordingly, we hold Contreras failed to adequately brief her argument. In re Estate of Rogers,\n322 S.W.3d 361, 363 n. 1 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2010, no pet.); Sterling v. Alexander, 99 S.W.3d 793,\n799 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (cases holding issue inadequately briefed\nwhen party failed to cite any authority and to make a cogent argument).

Clint Independent School Dist., 347 S.W.3d 413 (2011)\n271 Ed. Law Rep. 1188\n\n\n\n\n                                          Defining “Complication ”\n\nIn Issue Four, Contreras argues that the trial court improperly allowed Dr. Henderson to craft his\nown definition of complication, rather than apply a dictionary or ordinary meaning to the term.\nHowever, we have already concluded that expert medical testimony was necessary to establish the\nmeaning of complication as that term is defined within the medical community and also within\nthe settlement agreement. Moreover, to the extent that Contreras argues that Appellees failed to\nprovide any definition in their summary judgment motion that supported Dr. Henderson's view\nthat the revision surgeries were not due to complications from the previous surgeries, our review\nof the record has found two such definitions cited by Appellees: (1) that a “complication is an\nunexpected medical event directly resulting from the performance of a surgery ... [which include]\nshock, hemorrhage, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary complications, urinary\nretention and reaction to anesthesia;” and (2) that a “surgical complication is any undesirable,\nunintended, and direct result of surgery affecting the patient which would not have occurred had\nthe surgery gone as well as could reasonably be hoped.” The first definition appears on the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina's website, and the second definition comes from the World Journal\nof Surgery. Thus, Contreras' arguments on these grounds fail.\n\n [6] Contreras further asks us to apply her own definition of complication as found at an online\nmedical cite, www.medicinenet.com. However, Contreras did not present her definition to the\ntrial court. “Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or other\nresponse” to the motion for summary judgment “shall not be considered on appeal as grounds\nfor reversal.” TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c). Indeed, a party cannot raise new reasons why a summary\njudgment should have been denied for the first time on appeal. City of Houston v. Clear Creek\nBasin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678–79 (Tex.1979). Accordingly, Issue Four is overruled.\n\n\n\n                         Accord and Satisfaction, Release, and Res Judicata\n\n [7] Contreras' next two issues are fairly simple, and we will not dwell on them for long. In her fifth\nissue, Contreras asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by granting summary judgment\non grounds of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata when Appellees, according to the\nterms of the settlement agreement, agreed to not only pay for the costs of certain surgeries, but\nalso the costs of any complications resulting from those procedures. *421 In essence, Contreras\nmaintains that her skin laxity was a complication from those procedures, which invoked her\nbreach-of-contract claim and made Appellees' affirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction,\nrelease, and res judicata irrelevant. Similarly, in her sixth issue, Contreras alleges that Appellees'\nfailed to specifically allege how their affirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 1188\n\nres judicata applied to her issue that Appellees would pay for any complications resulting from\nher previous surgeries.\n\nHowever, it is clear from a reading of Appellees' motion for summary judgment, that they\nwere asserting that Contreras' revision surgeries were not complications from her previous\nsurgeries, and therefore, she could not succeed on her breach-of-contract claim. And because\nthere was no evidence that Appellees breached the settlement agreement, Appellees contended\nthat Contreras' additional revision surgeries were new surgeries from which Contreras already\nagreed to financially release Appellees from. Thus, Appellees' affirmative defenses of accord and\nsatisfaction, release, and res judicata were not only relevant to Contreras' breach-of-contract claim,\nbut also specifically tailored to that claim in their motion. Accordingly, Issues Five and Six are\noverruled.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled Contreras' issues, we affirm the trial court's judgment. 1\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n347 S.W.3d 413, 271 Ed.

BACKGROUND\n\n[1] Chrysler manufactures Chrysler, Dodge, Dodge Truck, and Jeep motor vehicles. Tommy\nManuel has been a franchised automobile dealer in the Dallas–Fort Worth area for forty-seven\nyears, including twenty-five years as a franchised Chrysler and Dodge dealer in Fort Worth and\nRichardson. At the time of trial, Tommy Manuel owned or controlled at least nine motor vehicle\ndealerships in the Dallas–Fort Worth market.\n\n\nA. Historical Backdrop\nIn the mid–1990s, as number three of the “Big Three” in that day, Chrysler developed a market\nrealignment plan called “Project 2000” to reorganize, relocate, and establish more motor vehicle\ndealerships to improve sales in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and to better compete with its rivals,\nFord and General Motors. As an essential part of Project 2000, Chrysler sought to have its various\nDallas–Fort Worth franchised dealers agree to waive their rights to protest the establishment or\nrelocation of other dealerships in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n\nTexas and other states closely regulate the distribution and sale of automobiles. In response to the\nsuperiority of economic power and bargaining strength of American automobile manufacturers\nin their relationships with dealers that had developed by the 1950s, with dealers completely\ndependent upon those manufacturers for their supply of automobiles, Congress 3 and state\nlegislatures enacted regulatory schemes to protect retail dealers from perceived abusive and\noppressive acts by the manufacturers. 4 In accord with the policy of protecting dealers and\nconsumers, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a California statute\nthat prohibited manufacturers from relocating or adding new dealerships to their market areas\nwhere the effect of such added competition would be injurious to existing franchisees and to the\npublic interest. 5 The Court held that a state may, consistent with due process, provide that the\nfiling of a protest by an existing dealer can, without a prior hearing, prevent another dealer from\nrelocating or establishing a new dealership in the existing dealer's defined market area until after\na hearing and resolution of the protest. 6\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 15\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nThe Texas Motor Vehicle Commission Code (TMVC), this State's first regulation *167 of the\nmotor vehicle manufacturer-dealer relationship, was adopted in 1971. 7 The policy of the TMVC,\nset forth in what is now section 2301.001 of the occupations code, is to ensure a sound system of\ndistribution and sale of motor vehicles for the protection of the public interest and welfare of the\ncitizens of Texas through exercise of this State's police power. 8\n\nThe TMVC, as do similar state statutory schemes like California's, provides a procedure by which\nan existing dealer may protest the establishment or relocation of a dealership that will sell the same\nline or make of vehicles in the same county or within fifteen miles of the existing dealership. 9\nThe filing of a notice of protest triggers an administrative proceeding requiring a hearing before\nthe Commission, in which the applicant for the new dealership has the burden to establish “good\ncause” for establishing or relocating the dealership at the proposed location. 10 In the meantime,\nfiling of the notice effects an immediate statutory stay as to any action by the applicant to establish\nor relocate the proposed new dealership or relocation until the protest is resolved. 11 Among its\nfindings of fact, the trial court found that a hearing and final resolution of the protest could take\nyears. Complicating matters in this case, the TMVC provides that any agreement waiving terms\nof the TMVC is void and unenforceable. 12\n\n\nB. Project 2000\nBy mid-July of 1999, after several years of efforts to obtain agreements for the realignment of\nthe Dallas–Fort Worth market from its various dealers in the area, Chrysler had circulated and\nobtained settlement agreements, including waivers of the right to protest, from each of the Dallas–\nFort Worth area dealers participating in Project 2000, with the exception of Manuel. Manuel was\naware of Chrysler's plan but was not originally a Project 2000 participant for several reasons.\nChrysler had litigation pending against one of Manuel's dealerships (and other dealerships in Texas\nand California) for allegedly seeking fraudulent warranty credits from Chrysler for engine cores\n(the Cores litigation), and Manuel had a protest against Chrysler pending before the Commission\narising out of the Cores litigation. Additionally, Manuel had bought and operated for twenty-five\nyears a successful dealership in Richardson with a “trip,” that is, three lines—Chrysler, Dodge car,\nand Dodge truck. Chrysler had been trying to buy the Chrysler line from Manuel for many years,\nand he had refused to sell it. Chrysler desired the Chrysler line to keep Manuel from protesting\nother dealers in that market area as well as to give that “point” to another dealer to complete\nthe Project 2000 market realignment. Chrysler approached Manuel last regarding Project 2000\nbecause it knew that Manuel would *168 be the most expensive to deal with. Joe Park, Chrysler's\nDallas zone manager at the time, recalled at trial, “We had to get him out of the way.”\n\nIn mid-August 1999, during a meeting of Dodge truck dealers in San Antonio, Chrysler\nrepresentatives from Detroit and the Dallas zone office met with Manuel about joining Project\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   16\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n2000, and the parties proceeded to negotiate. Chrysler offered Manuel $5 million for his Chrysler\nline at the Richardson dealership, and Manuel bargained for $15 million and another dealership\nto replace it. The parties discussed possible locations for an additional dealership, and Park told\nManuel that the other dealers had signed waivers of the right to protest relocations or additional\ndealerships in joining Project 2000. By the end of August 1999, the two parties had arrived at a\ncomprehensive agreement.\n\n\nC. The Agreements\nManuel signed two written agreements dated August 31, 1999, after reviewing them with his\nattorney (who had represented him in the Cores litigation). One was a settlement and release\nagreement (the Settlement Agreement) similar to those entered into with the other dealers\nparticipating in Project 2000. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Chrysler paid Manuel $15.34\nmillion to settle the Cores litigation, to relinquish the Chrysler line at his Richardson dealership,\nand to waive any right to protest the other dealers involved in Project 2000. The second agreement,\nattached to and referenced in the Settlement Agreement, was titled “Agreement to Enter into\nSales and Service Agreement” (the AESSA). By the AESSA, Chrysler agreed to enter into a\nfranchise agreement with Manuel for a new Chrysler–Jeep dealership in South Arlington (the\nSouth Arlington dealership), conditioned upon Manuel providing the land, building the facility,\nand furnishing the capital investment for the new dealership by January 1, 2001.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement stated that the South Arlington dealership was “subject to the\npossibility that it may be protested” by another dealer and that a protest “can significantly delay the\nestablishment or relocation of the dealership subject to the protest.” The AESSA in turn provided\nthat, in the event of a protest against the South Arlington dealership, Chrysler would “use its best\nefforts to litigate or settle the protest or lawsuit in order to allow the establishment of [the South\nArlington] dealership.”\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Manuel ceased selling Chrysler vehicles at\nhis Richardson dealership within thirty days after the agreements were signed in August 1999.\nAs required by the AESSA, Manuel created a new corporation (Tommy Manuel Chrysler–Jeep,\nInc.) and filed his application with the Commission for the new dealership in South Arlington in\nDecember, which was approved on January 14, 2000. Manuel purchased property for the South\nArlington dealership in April 2000.\n\n\nD. Meador's Protest\nOn January 28, 2000, Meador Chrysler–Plymouth, Inc. (Meador), one of the other dealerships that\nwas part of Project 2000 and whose dealer-principal had signed a protest waiver, filed a notice of\nprotest against the creation of the South Arlington dealership, which would be located less than\nfifteen miles from Meador's existing dealership. The filing of Meador's protest was unexpected\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   17\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nby both Manuel and Chrysler, and it triggered the statutory stay of Manuel's attempts to open the\nSouth Arlington dealership.\n\nChrysler's zone manager and other representatives met with Mr. Meador and his *169 business\nassociate on a number of occasions, requesting that Meador withdraw its protest. Chrysler moved\nto have the protest dismissed by the Commission, acting as Meador's attorney-in-fact as provided\nby Meador's settlement agreement. Failing that effort, on March 31, 2000, Chrysler filed suit\nin federal district court in the Western District of Texas, obtained a stay of the administrative\nproceeding, and sought injunctive relief and to compel arbitration of the issues raised by Meador's\nprotest. The federal court initially stayed the state administrative proceeding but, after a hearing,\ndenied all relief on June 7, 2000, abated the suit in its own court, and returned the protest\nto the Commission for resolution. Chrysler then sought and obtained permission to file an\ninterlocutory appeal of the adverse ruling and intervened in the administrative proceeding before\nthe Commission. In July 2000, Chrysler filed its appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from\nthe federal district court's adverse decision. Also in July of 2000, pursuant to a strategy agreed upon\nat a meeting between Manuel and Chrysler and their respective attorneys, Manuel filed a separate\nsuit in state court against Meador for damages resulting from the delay of the establishment of his\nnew dealership caused by Meador's protest.\n\nIn September 2000, some eight months after the protest had been filed, Chrysler had intensive\nsettlement negotiations with Meador. Chrysler ultimately settled the Meador protest in October\n2000 by giving Meador a letter of intent for an additional dealership and paying Meador $17,000 in\nattorney's fees. In November 2000, Chrysler advised Manuel to proceed with building his facility\nfor the new dealership in South Arlington, and the Meador protest was formally dismissed on\nDecember 21, 2000.\n\n\nE. This Suit\nIt was undisputed that the years 2000 and 2001 were exceptionally good years for car sales in the\nDallas–Fort Worth market, but Manuel was not able to complete and open the South Arlington\ndealership until February 2002. A significant downturn in sales and a steep decline of the American\nmarket share of automobiles began in 2002. They were continuing at the time of trial, and the new\ndealership sustained a loss for 2002 and subsequent years.\n\nIn 2004, Manuel sued Chrysler for breach of contract and other causes of action, seeking damages\ncaused by the delay in opening the South Arlington dealership as the result of Chrysler's failure to\nresolve Meador's protest, the costs Manuel incurred in litigating Meador's protest before the state\nagency and in state court, and attorney's fees. Manuel contended that Chrysler failed to use its best\nefforts as required by the AESSA to litigate or settle the Meador protest, thereby causing the delay\nin the opening of the South Arlington dealership.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgments to Chrysler on most of Manuel's causes of action,\nincluding breach of contract, but on the morning of trial on damages, the trial judge announced\nduring opening statements that he would hear evidence regarding breach of the best efforts\nclause by Chrysler. The parties tried the case to the bench over a sporadic period of about six\nweeks regarding that issue and damages. Among its findings of fact, the trial court found that\nChrysler failed to use its best efforts to resolve the Meador protest and that Chrysler “breached\nthe contract.” 13 The trial court rendered *170 a final judgment awarding Manuel $370,668.50\nin damages plus prejudgment interest but denied Manuel recovery of attorney's fees. Both parties\nappealed. Chrysler seeks reversal of the trial court's judgment and rendition of a take-nothing\njudgment, and Manuel seeks remand for a new trial on the issue of attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                           III. BEST EFFORTS\n\nBy its first issue, Chrysler argues that the AESSA's best efforts clause is unenforceable because it\nlacks measurable goals and guidelines and that even if the best efforts clause is enforceable, the\ngoal of the agreement was the opening of the South Arlington dealership, meaning best efforts are\nirrelevant because that goal was ultimately met. Chrysler alternatively contends that the evidence\nconclusively established that Chrysler used its best efforts to resolve the Meador protest. 14\n\n\nA. Enforceability of “Best Efforts” Clause\n\n1.

Goals and guidelines\n [2] Chrysler first argues that “best efforts” is a vague standard that is rarely held enforceable.\nBut Chrysler's own general counsel and legal department drafted the settlement agreements\nand AESSAs used to implement Project 2000. Moreover, and to the contrary, courts enforce\ncontractual best efforts clauses in a wide variety of circumstances. See E. Farnsworth, Farnsworth\non Contracts § 7.17c (2d ed. 2001) (stating it is no longer the case that “a duty defined only in\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Adams,\nUnderstanding “Best Efforts” and Its Variants (Including Drafting Recommendations), 50 No.\n4 Practical Lawyer, Aug. 2004, at 17 (noting courts in most jurisdictions have held best efforts\nclauses enforceable). “Whatever the test of best efforts, there is no question but that courts today\nregard the standard of best efforts—like that of good faith—as a workable standard in a variety\nof circumstances.” E. Farnsworth, On Trying to Keep One's Promises: The Duty of Best *171\nEfforts in Contract Law, 46 U. Pitt. L.Rev. 1, 12 (1984).\n\nCourts construing a best efforts provision that does not specify the performance to be required\ncommonly hold the promisor to the standard of the diligence a reasonable person would use under\nthe circumstances. See, e.g., CKB & Assocs., Inc. v. Moore McCormack Petroleum, Inc., 809\nS.W.2d 577, 578 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, writ denied) (op. on reh'g) (comparing performance of\nbest efforts with that of average prudent operator in light of circumstances of case); see also Bloor\nv. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 601 F.2d 609, 614–15 (2d Cir.1979) (holding licensor could not treat\nlicensees brands less favorably than its own); Van Valkenburgh, Nooger & Neville, Inc. v. Hayden\nPubl'g Co., 30 N.Y.2d 34, 330 N.Y.S.2d 329, 281 N.E.2d 142, 144 (1972) (holding publisher\nwho promised best efforts to promote author's book not restricted from also promoting competing\nseries); Farnsworth, 46 U. Pitt. L.Rev. at 7–8 (“Best efforts is a standard that has diligence as its\nessence ....”).\n\nChrysler, quoting from the Dallas court of appeals opinion in CKB, specifically complains that the\nbest efforts clause in this case lacks measurable goals and guidelines. 809 S.W.2d at 580. In that\ncase, CKB had agreed to use its best efforts to refine crude oil into specific volumes of refined\nproducts, as set out in the agreement in a schedule specifying percentages of total refinery output\nfor each product. Id. at 578. Instead of refining the crude oil to produce the quantities specified in\nthe contract, CKB operated the refinery to produce the highest dollar yield on the crude. Id. at 579,\n582. Moore McCormack sued CKB for breach of contract, and the trial court rendered summary\njudgment in Moore McCormacks favor. Id. at 580. CKB appealed. Id.\n\nAs Chrysler points out, the CKB court described the provision for “best efforts” in a contract\nas a nebulous standard.... Under some circumstances, a party could use best efforts to achieve a\ncontractual goal and fall well short. Under different circumstances, an effort well short of ones\nbest may suffice to hit a target. See id. at 581. Thus, that court reasoned, “To be enforceable,\na best efforts contract must set some kind of goal or guideline against which best efforts may\nbe measured.” Id. at 581–82 (citing Pinnacle Books, Inc. v. Harlequin Enters., 519 F.Supp. 118,\n121 (S.D.N.Y.1981)). The court concluded that when sufficient guidelines exist, a party that\nperforms within the guidelines fulfills the contract regardless of the quality of its efforts. Id. at\n582. Only when a party misses the guidelines would a court measure the quality of its efforts “by\nthe circumstances of the case ... and by comparing the party's performance with that of an average,\nprudent, comparable operator.” Id. (citing Bloor, 601 F.2d at 613–14; Pinnacle, 519 F.Supp.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  20\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nat 122; Arnold Prods., Inc. v. Favorite Films Corp., 176 F.Supp. 862, 866 (S.D.N.Y.1959)).\nUltimately, the court affirmed the summary judgment against CKB because it concluded that CKB\nmade no efforts to meet the production standards specified in the contract, stating: “As a matter of\nlaw, no efforts cannot be best efforts.” Id. (citing Bloor, 601 F.2d at 613–14). 15 Thus, the CKB\n *172 court did not further explore the “goal or guideline” standard.\n\nChrysler argues that the best efforts clause in the AESSA is unenforceable because it fails to set\nforth a measurable goal or guideline in that no date was specified by which Chrysler was required\nto litigate or settle the Meador protest. Manuel responds that, reading the contract as a whole,\nthe AESSA required Chrysler to settle or litigate the Meador protest in a manner that allowed\nManuel to open the South Arlington dealership on or before January 1, 2001. Manuel references\nlanguage in the AESSA stating that he was required to build and complete the facilities for the\nSouth Arlington dealership before January 1, 2001, that the establishment of the South Arlington\ndealership was of “major importance” to Chrysler, and that “time is of the essence.”\n\nIn Herrmann Holdings, Ltd. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., the contract required Lucent to use\nits “reasonable best efforts” to file registration paperwork with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) “as promptly as practicable” or “in the most expeditious manner practicable.”\n302 F.3d 552, 556 (5th Cir.2002). Rejecting the very argument by Lucent that Chrysler makes\nhere, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Herrmann Holdings's pleadings stated a claim for\nbreach of contract, significantly stating that “[r]equiring contracting parties to fix a date certain in\norder to set a temporal guideline in which to complete a certain task demands more definiteness\nthan Texas law requires.” Id. at 560 (emphasis added).\n\nHere, the best efforts provision states: “[Chrysler] will use its best efforts to litigate or settle the\nprotest or lawsuit in order to allow the establishment of [the South Arlington] dealership.” The\nbest efforts provision does not include language similar to the “as promptly as practicable” or “in\nthe most expeditious manner practicable” language in Herrmann Holdings, but the AESSA does\nspecifically and expressly contemplate establishing the South Arlington dealership by January\n1, 2001. 16 Even absent such language, we cannot interpret the best efforts provision as placing\nno deadline at all for Chrysler to litigate or settle the Meador protest because doing so reads the\nJanuary 1, 2001 deadline out of the AESSA and renders the best efforts clause itself meaningless.\nSee id. Rather, the goal or objective of the best efforts provision in the AESSA, in light of the\nagreement as a whole, was for Chrysler to use its best efforts to litigate or settle the Meador protest\nin such a period of time that Manuel could establish the South Arlington dealership by January\n1, 2001.\n\nMoreover, other courts have held enforceable “best efforts” requirements in contracts that\ncontained none of the defining language in Herrmann Holdings. See, e.g., First Union Nat'l Bank\nv. Steele Software Sys. Corp., 154 Md.App. 97, 838 A.2d 404, 428–29, 433, 448 (2003) (holding\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n“best efforts” is a standard in and of itself and is therefore enforceable, noting that even where\n“best efforts” is not defined it is “a standard that has diligence as its essence” *173 and a term that\n“takes its meaning from the circumstances”); see also Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Dist., Inc.,\n361 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (“ ‘Best efforts' is implicitly qualified by a reasonableness test—it\ncannot mean everything possible under the sun.”) (citing Macksey v. Egan, 36 Mass.App.Ct. 463,\n633 N.E.2d 408, 413 & n. 16 (1994)); Baron Fin. Corp. v. Natanzon, 509 F.Supp.2d 501, 513–\n14 (D.Md.2007) (applying Maryland law and holding best efforts clause enforceable and defined\nin terms of reasonableness highly dependent upon surrounding circumstances); Mark P. Gergen,\nThe Use of Open Terms in Contract, 92 Columbia L.Rev. 997, 1000 (1992) (“Best efforts clauses\nand other terms that require a party to use reasonable diligence in performance are obviously like\na negligence rule.”).\n\n [3] This is in accord with the well-established rule that, where a contract does not fix the time for\nperformance (which is Chrysler's specific complaint about the AESSA), it will be presumed that\nthe agreement is to be performed within a reasonable time. Hewlett–Packard Co. v. Benchmark\nElecs., Inc., 142 S.W.3d 554, 563 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied); CherCo\nProps., Inc. v. Law, Snakard & Gambill, P.C., 985 S.W.2d 262, 266 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1999,\nno pet.). What is a reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances as they existed at\nthe time the contract was formed. CherCo Props., Inc., 985 S.W.2d at 266. Therefore, even if the\nJanuary 1, 2001 date specified in the AESSA for opening the new dealership were not controlling\n(and it is undisputed that the protest was not resolved in time for Manuel to build his facility and\nopen for more than a year after that date), we hold that the best efforts provision in the AESSA\nhad a measurable timeline or goal of resolving any protest by settlement or litigation within a\nreasonable time and was thus enforceable. We overrule the first part of Chrysler's first issue.\n\n\nB. The Quality of Chrysler's Efforts\n [4] Chrysler next argues that, even if the best efforts clause is enforceable, the AESSA's only goal\nwas the opening of the South Arlington dealership and that because Chrysler's efforts eventually\nsettled the protest, it met the goal because the South Arlington dealership eventually opened. Thus,\nChrysler, citing Herrmann Holdings, 302 F.3d at 559, argues that the “analysis ends” and that\nwhether Chrysler used its best efforts is irrelevant. But the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Herrmann\nHoldings is again instructive in rejecting this argument. In that case, Lucent eventually filed the\nregistration paperwork with the SEC, and the SEC approved the transaction. Id. at 557. But by\nthat time, the Herrmanns had been damaged by the decline in Lucent's stock price. Id. The Fifth\nCircuit held that the Herrmanns had stated a plausible claim for breach of the best efforts clause;\nin other words, that Lucent eventually filed the paperwork and that the SEC eventually approved\nthe transaction did not negate as a matter of law the allegations of a breach by Lucent of the best\nefforts clause. Id. at 561.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   22\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nThe goal of the contract here—a goal Chrysler itself identified as having major importance—was\nnot just opening the South Arlington dealership someday, but opening the dealership by January 1,\n2001. Using the CKB analysis, we consider the “performance ... of an average, prudent, comparable\noperator” under the circumstances of the case to determine the quality of Chrysler's performance.\nSee 809 S.W.2d at 582. We conclude that, even absent a date certain by which Chrysler was\nobligated to litigate or settle the protest, the fact that Chrysler eventually settled *174 the Meador\nprotest so that the South Arlington dealership opened a year later than contemplated does not\nestablish as a matter of law that Chrysler met the goal. We overrule this part of Chrysler's first issue.\n\n\nC. Legally Sufficient Evidence of Breach of Best Efforts Clause\n [5] In the final part of its first issue, Chrysler argues that, even if it missed the goal of timely\nresolving the protest, the evidence nevertheless conclusively establishes that it used its best efforts.\nManuel responds that, under the evidence, that issue was one of fact that was properly resolved\nagainst Chrysler by the trial court as fact finder.\n\n\n1. Standard of Review\nWe may sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when (1) the record discloses a complete\nabsence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital\nfact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of a\nvital fact.

Calvert, “No Evidence”\nand “Insufficient Evidence” Points of Error, 38 Tex. L.Rev. 361, 362–63 (1960). In determining\nwhether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the finding under review, we must consider\nevidence favorable to the finding if a reasonable factfinder could and disregard evidence contrary\nto the finding unless a reasonable factfinder could not.

Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807, 827 (Tex.2005).\n\nFindings of fact entered in a case tried to the court have the same force and dignity as a jury's\nanswers to jury questions. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex.1991).

Analysis\nChrysler argues that the AESSA did not obligate it to pay any money to Meador and urges that\nits other efforts to resolve Meador's protest were reasonable and prudent in settling the protest\nwithin nine months. Chrysler points to evidence that its zone manager Joe Park (1) met with *175\nMeador's co-owner and sales manager (because Mr. Meador was ill and unavailable) soon after\nMeador filed its protest and urged withdrawal of the protest; (2) remained in constant contact with\nthem; (3) later talked to Mr. Meador, who would not overrule his co-owner's answer of “no”;\nand (4) finally reminded Meador's representatives that Meador's protest was a breach of Meador's\nown contractual agreement not to protest other relocations or new dealerships in Project 2000.\nBut Park never offered money to Meador to withdraw its protest because he did not think he\nneeded to since Meador had signed a contract. Park also testified that he did not think Meador\nwanted money and instead wanted to delay Manuel's dealership as long as possible. Chrysler thus\ncontinued on its litigation path, seeking to have the administrative protest dismissed, obtaining a\nstay of those proceedings, and filing suit in federal court against Meador for an injunction and to\ncompel arbitration regarding the validity of the protest.\n\nIn CKB, the Dallas court of appeals stated that “[w]hen a party misses the guidelines, courts\nmeasure the quality of its efforts by the circumstances of the case and by comparing the party's\nperformance with that of an average, prudent, comparable operator.” 809 S.W.2d at 582 (citations\nomitted). While there is evidence of the circumstances surrounding Meador's protest, of Chrysler's\nefforts to have Meador withdraw that protest (which Chrysler refers to as evidence of efforts to\nsettle), and of Chrysler's eventual settlement of the protest, the evidence is undisputed that Chrysler\nand Meador did not exchange settlement proposals until September 2000 and that they did not\nreach a settlement until October 4, 2000.\n\nThe trial court could have reasonably inferred that Chrysler wanted to “clear the market” for\nall of the dealerships participating in Project 2000 and that Chrysler's strategy was, in effect, to\nremove the protest waiver issue to federal court and seek arbitration to avoid a determination of\nthat issue by the Commission under the Texas regulatory scheme (which is not to say that such a\nstrategy was unreasonable per se). The federal district court denied injunctive relief and Chrysler's\nmotion to compel arbitration on June 7, 2000, and issued an eleven-page order explaining the\nreasons, including that the validity of the protest waiver under the terms of the TMVC was more\nappropriately for the agency to decide and that Manuel was not a party and would not be bound\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   24\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nby an arbitration award or a decision from the federal court. See DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp. v.\nMeador Chrysler–Plymouth, Inc., No. A–00–CA–216–SS, at *10–11 (W. Dist. Tex. June 7, 2000).\nHence the federal court abated the suit in its own court and returned the issue to the administrative\nagency for decision. Id. 17 At least by that point, as the trial court in this case noted during closing\narguments, Chrysler must have had “some understanding” of the unlikelihood of success with\nits litigation efforts. Yet Chrysler still did nothing to settle for several more months. During that\ntime, Chrysler pursued its interlocutory *176 appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and\nstrategized with Manuel to coordinate his filing suit in state court against Meador, all of which only\nfurther delayed the resolution of the Meador protest. After settling with Meador in October 2000,\nChrysler notified Manuel that he could proceed with building his facility in November 2000, and\nthe protest was formally dismissed in December 2000. By that time, all of the other Project 2000\ndealers in the area were selling cars. But Manuel was unable to begin building his new dealership\nfacility by reason of the pending protest until after the settlement and, consequently, was not able\nto open for business until February 2002.\n\nWhat would a prudent, comparable automobile manufacturer have done? As was acknowledged\nby the parties in the Settlement Agreement, Chrysler and Manuel both knew from the outset that a\nprotest could entail significant delay, and Chrysler knew that a protest by any dealer participating\nin Project 2000 would present a significant obstacle to the accomplishment of its planned market\nrealignment. The testimony was undisputed that Chrysler had planned all along to pay dealers for\ntheir agreement not to protest for that very reason and had budgeted $50 million toward preventing\nor resolving protests such as that filed by Meador in order to implement Project 2000 in the\nDallas–Fort Worth area. Chrysler budgeted $11.2 million to pay another dealer for a protest waiver\nbut ended up paying that dealer $1 million and giving him a new point (a new dealership), and\nChrysler paid $1 million to another dealer who was not a Project 2000 participant in order to settle\na threatened protest within a few days after that dealer approached Chrysler.\n\nAlthough Chrysler offered evidence that Meador only wanted to delay Manuel's new dealership\nas long as possible, there was contradictory evidence that Meador might have been interested in a\nsettlement and that it wanted a “point”. Chrysler had two open points and a substantial remaining\nbudget of around $30 million after payments to Manuel and other dealers but did not offer either\nmoney or a point to Meador until late September 2000, so there is no way to know what Meador\nwould have accepted at an earlier date. And Chrysler's witnesses were unable to explain why\nChrysler never offered any of its multi-million dollar budget to settle the Meador protest.\n\nChrysler argues that the AESSA did not obligate it to pay any money to Meador, that it had no\ncontractual obligation to use the $50 million it had allocated to its budget to settle protests by\ndealers, and that it could simply have “ignored” settling with Meador until it had fully litigated\nits pending federal court and administrative proceedings. Chrysler reasons that Manuel's position\n(and the trial court's finding of failure to use best efforts) imposed “an additional burden” on\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    25\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nChrysler of settlement. Chrysler argues that its choice to litigate rather than settle was solely within\nits discretion under the AESSA, that it was entitled to exercise its legal right to enforce Meador's\nagreement to waive the statutory right to protest, and that there was no prohibition in either the\nAESSA or the Settlement Agreement against Chrysler trying to hold Meador to its agreement.\nAccording to Chrysler, punishing it for choosing to pursue litigation rather than to settle would\nstrip Chrysler of its right to access to the courts to enforce its rights.\n\nBy all of these arguments, Chrysler overlooks its agreement in the AESSA that contractually\nobligated it to use its best efforts not simply to litigate but “to litigate or settle the protest or lawsuit\nin order to allow the establishment of the South Arlington dealership.” [Emphasis *177 added].\nThe question is not whether Chrysler should have litigated, as we agree that was its right. Rather,\nthe question is when did Chrysler's choice to litigate to the exclusion of making any efforts toward\nsettlement become unreasonable. See CKB, 809 S.W.2d at 582 (stating that when a party fails to\nmeet goal or guideline, court measures quality of its efforts by circumstances and comparison of\nperformance of the prudent comparable operator); see also Herrmann Holdings, 302 F.3d at 559\n(stating court may look to circumstances of case and compare party's performance in similar cases\nin determining whether party failed to exercise best efforts).\n\nAccording to a letter from Manuel's counsel, Chrysler assured Manuel in mid-June 2000 that it\nwas going to dismiss the federal appeal and attempt to settle with Meador while Manuel filed suit\nand litigated against Meador in state court. Although Manuel did file and litigate that suit, Chrysler\nstill made no effort to settle with Meador until late September. As held by the court in CKB, “[N]o\nefforts cannot be best efforts.” See 809 S.W.2d at 582.\n\nApplying the appropriate standard of review, we hold that there is legally sufficient evidence to\nsupport the trial courts finding that Chrysler breached the best efforts provision in the AESSA.\nSee Cent. Ready Mix Concrete, 228 S.W.3d at 651; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 807, 827; see\nalso Martinez, 977 S.W.2d at 334. We overrule the remainder of Chrysler's first issue.\n\n\n\n                                  IV. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES\n\nBy its second issue, Chrysler contends that the trial court erred by awarding Manual damages\nof $370,668.50 based upon Manuel's claim for lost profits for the one-year period during which\nManuel was not able to open the South Arlington dealership. Chrysler relies upon the AESSA's\nlimitation-of-damages provision, which limits recoverable damages solely to “out-of-pocket\nexpenses that cannot be mitigated,” and argues that Manual is barred from recovering lost profits\nas damages by waiver of “incidental and consequential damages” in both the AESSA and the\nSettlement Agreement. 18 Chrysler complains that the trial court erred as a matter of law in\ndisregarding these contractual limitations of damages. Alternatively, Chrysler contends that, if\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                         26\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nthe trial court concluded that the limitation of damages provisions were ambiguous, there is no\nevidence to support the trial court's finding of fact that the parties' intent was to allow recovery of\n“actual damages” under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n\nA. Preservation of Error\n [6] Manuel first asks us to summarily overrule Chrysler's second issue because Chrysler failed\nto negate every basis supporting the judgment. Specifically, Manuel argues that Chrysler only\nchallenges “lost profits” but that the trial court could have rested its damage award on Manuel's\nindividual claims for lost salary and rental income for which there is evidence and which Manuel\nasserts are independent grounds not challenged on appeal.\n\n [7] Rule of appellate procedure 38.1(f) provides that “[t]he statement of an issue or point will\nbe treated as covering every subsidiary question that is fairly included.” Tex.R.App. P. 38.1(f). In\nthis regard, the Supreme Court of Texas has stated that *178 “disposing of appeals for harmless\nprocedural defects is disfavored”; that appellate courts are to construe appellate briefs “reasonably,\nyet liberally, so that the right to appellate review is not lost by waiver”; and that “appellate courts\nshould reach the merits of an appeal whenever reasonably possible.” Perry v. Cohen, 272 S.W.3d\n585, 587 (Tex.2008).\n\nWhile Chrysler's second issue discusses the damages awarded in short-hand form as “lost profits,”\nChrysler's overarching contention is that the limitation-of-damages clause of the AESSA limits\nManuel's damages to out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated. 19 None of Manuel's\ndamage claims—whether for lost profits, lost owner's salary, or lost rental income—are for out-of-\npocket expenses; each claim seeks recovery of benefit-of-the-bargain damages as if the contract\nhad been performed. See Bechtel Corp. v. CITGO Prods. Pipeline Co., 271 S.W.3d 898, 927\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2008, no pet.) (stating that expectation damages are designed to award the\nclaimant “the benefit of his bargain by being put in as good a position as he would have been had\nthe contract or promise been performed”).\n\nWhether Manuel may recover any damages (which would include lost profits, lost salary, and lost\nrentals) other than out-of-pocket expenses is fairly included within Chrysler's second issue; lost\nowner's salary and rental income are not independent, unchallenged grounds supporting the trial\ncourt's judgment. See Tex.R.App. P. 38.1(f); Perry, 272 S.W.3d at 586–87; cf. Reliford v. BNSF\nRy. Co., No. 02–09–00322–CV, 2011 WL 255795, at *1 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth Jan. 27, 2011,\nno pet.) (mem. op.) (holding appellant failed to challenge each independent ground supporting\njudgment because jury found statute of limitations barred claim and appellant only complained\nof charge error on his affirmative cause of action).

Applicable Law\nIncluded within the resolution of Chrysler's second issue are legal determinations relating to the\ninterpretation of contracts, the consideration of separate writings together, ambiguity, and the\ndifferences between direct and consequential damages for breach of contract.\n\n\n1. Rules of Interpretation and Contract Construction\nInterpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court to decide de novo.\nCoker, 650 S.W.2d at 393. Our primary concern in construing a written contract is to ascertain\nthe objective intent of the parties as expressed in the contract. Id.; City of the Colony v. N. Tex.\nMun. Water Dist., 272 S.W.3d 699, 722 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008, pet. dismissed). We examine\nand consider the entire document in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the\ncontract so that none will be rendered meaningless. Seagull Energy E & P, Inc. v. Eland Energy,\nInc., 207 S.W.3d 342, 345 (Tex.2006); Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393; City of the Colony, 272 S.W.3d\nat 722.\n\nWe examine all parts of the agreement in light of the circumstances surrounding the formation\nof the contract. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 591\n(Tex.1996). Instruments *179 pertaining to the same subject matter must be considered together\nto ascertain the intent of the parties. In re Prudential Ins. Co., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135 (Tex.2004)\n(orig. proceeding); see City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 811 (even writings executed at different times\nmust be considered together if they pertain to the same transaction); DeWitt County Elec. Co-op.,\nInc. v. Parks, 1 S.W.3d 96, 102 (Tex.1999). We view the contracts “from a utilitarian standpoint\nbearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served.” Frost Nat'l Bank v. L &\nF Distribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex.2005) (quoting Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., 727\nS.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex.1987)); Clark v. Cotten Schmidt, L.L.P., 327 S.W.3d 765, 772 (Tex.App.-\nFort Worth 2010, no pet.).\n\nWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster,\n128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex.2003). Lack of clarity does not create an ambiguity, and a contract\nis not ambiguous merely because the parties advance conflicting interpretations. Id.; City of the\nColony, 272 S.W.3d at 722. We determine whether a contract is ambiguous by considering the\ncontract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the parties entered into it. Universal\nHealth Servs., Inc. v. Renaissance Women's Grp., P.A., 121 S.W.3d 742, 746 (Tex.2003). The\ntrial court should ascertain the objective intent of the parties as expressed in the writing itself. Sun\nOil Co. v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.1981). A contract is ambiguous when its meaning\nremains uncertain or subject to more than one reasonable interpretation after it is subjected to\napplicable rules of interpretation. Frost Nat'l Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312; Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393–\n94. It is only after a determination by the trial court that the contract is in fact ambiguous that\nparol evidence becomes admissible, and then only to assist the fact finder in determining what the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Law on Contract Damages\nBecause the agreements do not define the terms “actual damages” or “consequential damages,” we\npresume that the parties intended their ordinary meanings. Cherokee Cnty. Cogeneration Partners,\nL.P. v. Dynegy Mktg. & Trade, 305 S.W.3d 309, 314 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no\npet.). The trial court found, and neither party disagrees, that the AESSA did not involve the sale\nof goods or services. Therefore, we will apply common-law definitions rather than those set forth\nin Article 2 of the UCC. See id. (holding supply contract for purchase of natural gas to operate\ncogeneration facility not a contract for sale of goods and thus applying common law rather than\nUCC definition of consequential damages); Wade & Sons, Inc. v. Am. Standard, Inc., 127 S.W.3d\n814, 823 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, pet. denied) (noting different definitions used for direct and\nconsequential damages under Texas common law and as Texas courts have interpreted the UCC).\n\n [8] [9] [10] At common law, the term “actual damages” encompasses both “direct” and\n“consequential” damages. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 816\n(Tex.1997); Henry S. Miller Co. v. Bynum, 836 S.W.2d 160, 163 (Tex.1992) (Phillips, C.J.,\nconcurring). “Direct damages,” also known as “general damages,” are those inherent in the nature\nof the breach of the obligation between the parties, and they compensate a plaintiff for a loss\nthat is conclusively presumed to have been foreseen by the defendant as a usual and necessary\nconsequence of the defendant's act. Arthur Andersen & Co., 945 S.W.2d at 816; *180 Cherokee\nCnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314. One measure of direct damages is the “benefit of the bargain” measure,\nwhich utilizes an expectancy theory and evaluates the difference between the value as represented\nand the value received. See Mood v. Kronos Prods., Inc., 245 S.W.3d 8, 12 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n2007, pet. denied) (generally, measure of damages for breach is that which restores injured party\nto position he would have had if contract had been performed); Frost Nat'l Bank v. Heafner, 12\nS.W.3d 104, 111 n. 5 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, pet. denied) (citing Henry S. Miller,\n836 S.W.2d at 163).\n\n [11] “Consequential damages,” also referred to as “special damages,” are those said to result\nnaturally but not necessarily from the wrongful act because they require the existence of some other\nfact beyond the relationship of the parties. Arthur Andersen, 945 S.W.2d at 816 (consequential\ndamages not necessarily referable to the breach, but the loss must still have been reasonably\nforeseeable or within the contemplation of the parties); Henry S. Miller, 836 S.W.2d at 163;\nCherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 313–14; Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co. v. Technip USA Corp., No. 01–06–\n00535–CV, 2008 WL 3876141, at *8–9 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied) (mem.\nop.) (op. on reh'g).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 29\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n [12] Damages that might be considered “consequential” in one contract may be direct damages in\nanother. As Judge Cardozo wrote many years ago, the distinction between direct and consequential\ndamages under the common law is not absolute: “There is need to keep in mind that the distinction\nis not absolute, but relative. To put it in other words, damage which is general in relation to a\ncontract of one kind may be classified as special in relation to another.” Kerr S.S. Co. v. Radio\nCorp. of Am., 245 N.Y. 284, 157 N.E. 140, 141 (1927) (also noting that damages for delay\nmay be direct in some instances and consequential in others); see Rexnord Corp. v. DeWolff\nBoberg & Assocs., Inc., 286 F.3d 1001, 1004 (7th Cir.2002) (Posner, J.) (stating that common\nlaw “distinguishes between direct and consequential damages, the difference lying in the degree\nto which the damages are a foreseeable (that is, a highly probable) consequence of a breach”);\nComputrol, Inc. v. Newtrend, L.P., 203 F.3d 1064, 1071 n. 5 (8th Cir.2000) (“We are not convinced\nthat the [contract's] restriction on ‘special, incidental, or consequential damages,’ standing alone,\nprecludes the recovery of lost profits.... [I]t is incorrect to classify mechanically ... lost profits ... as\nconsequential damages.”). If the language of the contract indicates that the parties contemplated\nlost profits as the probable result of the breach, then those lost profits are more properly seen as a\npart of the contract, itself, and thus a form of direct damages. ViaStar Energy, LLC v. Motorola,\nInc., No. 1:05–CV–1095–DFH–WTL, 2006 WL 3075864, at *5–6 (S.D.Ind. Oct. 26, 2006); see\nalso White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 10–4 (Update 2011) (noting that it is a\n“fallacy” to assume that damages to a buyer, such as those resulting from delay, are inherently\nconsequential, since damages that are consequential under one contract may be direct or ordinary\nunder another); 11 Corbin on Contracts § 56.6 (2005) (noting courts' difficulty in establishing\na workable distinction between general and special damages, and observing that the appropriate\ndistinction of claimed damages varies with the context). Even under the UCC, it has been noted\nthat consequential damages under § 2.715(2) may overlap with difference in value damages\nrecoverable under § 2.714(2). *181 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 10–4. 20\n\n [13] [14] Lost profits may be either “direct” or “consequential” damages, depending on their\nnature. Cherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314; Mood, 245 S.W.3d at 12; Cont'l Holdings, Ltd. v.\nLeahy, 132 S.W.3d 471, 475 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2003, no pet.). As Chrysler argues, profits lost\non other contracts or relationships resulting from the breach (such as resale of property to a third\nparty) are generally classified as indirect or consequential damages. See Mood, 245 S.W.3d at 12;\nLeahy, 132 S.W.3d at 475. However, lost profits that represent the benefit-of-the-bargain measure\nof damages required to restore the plaintiff to the economic position he would have enjoyed if the\ncontract had been performed are “direct” damages when shown to be “conclusively presumed” to\nhave been foreseen by the parties as a usual and necessary consequence of a breach. See Cherokee\nCnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314.\n\n\nC. Analysis\n\n1. Relevant Contractual Language\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                        30\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nIn relevant part, the limitation-of-damages provision in the AESSA states:\n\n           In the event of default under this Agreement, the sole liability of the defaulting\n           party is payment of the other party's out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be\n           mitigated. Both [Manuel] and [Chrysler] waive all rights to other compensatory\n           damages or to consequential or punitive damages under any theory of law or\n           cause of action. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe Settlement Agreement, to which the AESSA is attached as “Exhibit A,” also contains a\nlimitation-of-damages provision, which states as follows:\n\n           [Manuel] and [Chrysler] waive any claims they may have for incidental or\n           consequential damages, for punitive or exemplary damages, and for jury trial,\n           that may arise by virtue of any breach of this [Settlement] Agreement or the\n           AESSA, or by virtue of any transaction based in whole or in part upon a provision\n           of this [Settlement] Agreement or the AESSA. The parties remain liable for any\n           actual damages. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe Settlement Agreement also provides that\n\n           [t]his [Settlement] Agreement is not part of the Sales and Service Agreement\n           of any dealership. The terms of any Sales and Service Agreement prevail if\n           there is any conflict. To the extent that there is any conflict between this\n           [Settlement] Agreement and any other agreement or document other than a\n           Sales and Service Agreement between [Chrysler] *182 and [Manuel], the terms\n           of this [Settlement] Agreement prevail. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n2. Agreements Must Be Construed Together\n [15] Chrysler first contends that only the limitation-of-damages provision in the AESSA (limiting\nManuel's recovery solely to “out of pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated”) applies because\nthe trial court found that Chrysler failed to use its best efforts and only the AESSA contains a “best\nefforts” clause. 21 But Manuel replies that the Settlement Agreement must be considered together\nwith and applies to any breach of the AESSA and further states that the Settlement Agreement\nprevails over the AESSA in the event of a conflict, meaning the trial court correctly awarded\ndamages pursuant to the Settlement Agreement's limitation-of-damages provision, which provides\nthat “[t]he parties remain liable for any actual damages.”\n\nChrysler does not challenge the trial court's finding that the Settlement Agreement and the\nAESSA “comprise the entire agreement between the parties.” That finding mirrors ¶ 3(l ) of\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 31\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nthe AESSA, which states that “[t]his Agreement, together with the [Settlement Agreement]\nexecuted contemporaneously with this agreement, is the entire Agreement between [Manuel] and\n[Chrysler].” The Settlement Agreement refers to and describes the purpose of the AESSA to “allow\nManuel to apply to the State of Texas for permission to establish a Chrysler, Plymouth, and Jeep\nDealership in Tarrant County, within the Dallas Market at the location set forth in Exhibit A [the\nAESSA].”\n\nThe Settlement Agreement contains numerous other references to the AESSA. And significantly,\nthe limitation-of-damages provision in the Settlement Agreement also states that it applies\nto “any claims for damages by virtue of any breach of this [Settlement] Agreement or the\nAESSA.” [Emphasis added]. Finally, the Settlement Agreement provides that, to the extent of any\nconflict with any other agreement (other than a Sales and Service Agreement, not at issue here),\nwhich would include the AESSA, “the terms of this [Settlement] Agreement prevail.” [Emphasis\nadded.]\n\nWe agree with Manuel that the two agreements must be construed as one instrument and\ninterpreted together. Although the AESSA limits Chrysler's liability for breach of that agreement to\n“out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated,” the Settlement Agreement states that it applies\nto any breach of that agreement or the AESSA, that it prevails to the extent of any conflict with the\nAESSA, and that “[t]he parties remain liable for any actual damages.” [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n *183 3. Lost Profits May Be Direct or Consequential Damages\n [16] There is no bright-line rule that lost profits always constitute consequential damages under\nthe common law (as Chrysler seems to contend), and Chrysler's cases holding that lost profits\nare consequential damages are not persuasive. For example, Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d\n325, 329 (Tex.2006), did not involve common law consequential damages but instead interpreted\nsection 271.153 of the Texas Local Government Code, which limits recovery to the “balance due\nand owing” under a contract with a city plus interest, thereby excluding recovery under that statute\nfor all lost profits as consequential damages. 22\n\nIn Leahy, 132 S.W.3d at 475, also relied upon by Chrysler, the limitation-of-damages provision\nexpressly excluded recovery for “lost profits,” both direct or consequential. Neither the AESSA\nnor the Settlement Agreement in this case even mentions “lost profits,” nor do the limitation-of-\ndamages provisions purport to allocate that risk to either party, even though the lost profits were the\nonly type of damages that Manuel would likely suffer from a significant delay caused by a protest\nfrom another dealer and that very risk was expressly mentioned in the Settlement Agreement and\naddressed by both the Settlement Agreement and the AESSA. Courts have construed limitation-\nof-damages clauses to preclude both direct and consequential lost profits where the clauses\nexpressly waived damages for either lost profits or consequential damages, but have held that\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   32\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\ndirect lost profits were not precluded where only “consequential” damages, either generally or\n“including” lost profits, were waived. Compare id. (limitation-of-liability clause precluded both\ndirect and consequential lost profits where contract waived damages for “loss of profits, loss\nof business, or any other indirect or consequential damages” (emphasis added)), with Cherokee\nCnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314 (holding direct lost profits recoverable although contract disallowed\n“consequential” damages), and Tenn. Gas, 2008 WL 3876141, at *6–8 (holding clause limiting\nrecovery of consequential damages “including ... lost profits” barred only consequential lost\nprofits). 23\n\nThe recent Cherokee County case supports recovery of lost profits for resale to third parties as\ndirect damages in the face of a limitation-of-damages clause, similar to the one in this case, which\nwaived recovery of consequential damages without mentioning lost profits. See 305 S.W.3d at 315.\nIn that case, a long-term contract for purchase of gas to operate a cogeneration facility contained a\nprovision allowing the buyer to use the gas to operate the facility or to resell the gas to third parties.\nId. at 311. When the seller failed to deliver the required volumes of gas as the claimed result of\nweather disruptions, the buyer sued for damages based on the difference between the amount it\nwould have to pay under the contract and the much higher amount that it would have received by\nselling the gas to third parties during that *184 period. Id. at 311–12. The seller contended that\nthe damages amounted to lost profits waived by the clause prohibiting recovery of consequential\ndamages, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the seller. Id. at 312. The Houston\nFourteenth Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the lost profits from the buyer's\ninability to resell gas not delivered to customers at the higher market value were “direct” damages\nnot precluded by the waiver of “consequential” damages contained in the contract. Id. at 314–15.\nHolding that the contract was not a sale of goods controlled by the UCC, the court used the common\nlaw definition of “consequential damages” and held that, by the parties' express agreement that\nthe buyer could resell the gas to a third party, the contract thereby implicitly authorized the buyer\nto profit from increases in the market price of the gas; thus, any wrongful interference with that\ncontract right “would naturally and necessarily cause [the buyer] to suffer direct damages in the\nform of profits on the [a]greement itself.” 24 Id. at 315 & n. 11. Thus, depending on the unique\ncircumstances of each case, including the specific language of the contract, lost profits may be\ndirect or consequential damages.\n\n\n4. Ambiguity Concerning Recoverable Damages\n\n\n                            a. Conflict Concerning Recoverable Damages\n\n [17] Considering the contracts together, the AESSA limits Chrysler's liability to out-of-pocket\nexpenses, but the Settlement Agreement provides that it “prevails” to the extent of any conflict\nwith the AESSA and states that the parties “remain liable for any actual damages.” The first and\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    33\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nmost obvious conflict is between the AESSA, which limits recovery to out-of-pocket expenses and\nexcludes consequential damages, and the Settlement Agreement, which allows recovery for actual\ndamages. The second conflict is between the retention of liability for “any actual damages” and the\nwaiver of consequential damages, both within the same paragraph of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nChrysler attempts to reconcile the obvious conflict between the limitation to “out-of-pocket\nexpenses” in the AESSA and the retention of liability for “actual damages” in the Settlement\nAgreement by focusing on a waiver of “consequential” damages contained in both agreements.\nChrysler argues that the lost profits damages awarded to Manuel are barred from recovery under\nboth agreements as “consequential damages” because they constituted only anticipated lost income\nfrom collateral contracts, that is, retail sales that Manuel claimed his new dealership could have\nmade to third parties during its first year of operation had it opened on time. But as discussed\nabove, lost profits are not per se consequential damages solely because sales to third parties are\ninvolved. See, e.g., Cherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314–15.\n\nChrysler also posits that one measure of direct “actual damages” is “out-of-pocket expenses” and\nthat interpreting the retention of liability for “actual damages” so as to allow Manuel's recovery\nonly of out-of-pocket expenses (by reason of the waiver of consequential damages) is consistent\nwith the limitation of damages in the AESSA to out-of-pocket expenses. While this *185\nproposed construction superficially harmonizes the two clauses, the limitation-of-damages clause\nin the AESSA already uses the term “out-of-pocket expenses.” It is not reasonable to interpret both\nterms, that is, “actual damages” and “out-of-pocket expenses,” to have the same meaning as that\nwould render one or the other term meaningless or redundant. See Cmty. Improvement Ass'n of\nLake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, No. 07–03–00036–CV, 2004 WL 2000666, at *4 (Tex.App.-\nAmarillo 2004, no pet.) (mem. op.) (declining to interpret different words used in document to\nhave the same meaning, effectively rendering one or the other redundant); Cherokee Water Co.\nv. Freeman, 33 S.W.3d 349, 354 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2000, no pet.) (holding that construing\ndifferent terms to have same meaning would render some words to be meaningless); see also\nPenncro Assocs., Inc., 499 F.3d at 1157 (“When a contract uses different language in proximate\nand similar provisions, we commonly ... assume that the parties' use of different language was\nintended to convey different meanings.”). Thus, we must assume that the use of the term “actual\ndamages” rather than “out-of-pocket expenses” in the Settlement Agreement was for a purpose\nand means something other than “out-of-pocket expenses.”\n\nChrysler next argues that reading the limitation of damages clause in the Settlement Agreement\nso that the more specific waiver of consequential damages controls over the more general term\n“actual damages” leads to a conclusion that the parties intended to retain liability only for actual\ndamages that are not incidental or consequential, meaning direct damages may be recovered but\nthat Manuel's lost profits are unrecoverable consequential damages. Chrysler cites Forbau v. Aetna\nLife Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 132, 133–34 (Tex.1994) for the secondary rule of construction that\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                34\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nspecific provisions control over general provisions. 25 But Forbau further states that “[t]his is but\nan application of our long-established rule that ‘[n]o one phrase, sentence, or section [of a contract]\nshould be isolated from its setting and considered apart from the other provisions.’ ” Id. (quoting\nGuardian Trust Co. v. Bauereisen, 132 Tex. 396, 403–05, 121 S.W.2d 579, 583 (1938)). And it\nbears repeating that lost profits are not per se consequential damages solely because there will be\na subsequent sale to third parties. See, e.g., Cherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314–15.\n\nChrysler's proposed interpretation—that the more specific waiver of consequential *186 damages\ncontrols over the more general term “actual damages,” meaning Manuel may only recover lost\nprofits that are “direct damages”—is reasonable. But this does not end our analysis because\nChrysler's interpretation is not the only reasonable interpretation of the agreements. Manuel\ncontends that the two agreements are ambiguous because they conflict on their face when read\ntogether. 26 Specifically, Manuel points out that the Settlement Agreement expressly provides\nthat it “prevails” in the event of a conflict with the AESSA and that the Settlement Agreement's\nlimitation of damages provision expressly states that it applies to a breach of the AESSA. Manuel\nalso points to the inherent conflict between the Settlement Agreement's purported waiver of\nconsequential damages and simultaneous retention of liability for any actual damages. Given these\nconflicts and the provisions in the AESSA that time was of the essence and that Chrysler had\nthe obligation to use its best efforts to litigate or settle any protest so that the South Arlington\ndealership could open by January 1, 2001, Manuel's interpretation of the agreements—preserving\nthe right to recover any actual damages—is also reasonable.\n\nAfter applying the applicable rules of interpretation and considering all of the circumstances\nsurrounding the execution of the agreements; the lack of specific waiver of lost profits in either\nagreement; and the lack of any definition of consequential, compensatory, or actual damages,\nwe are left with terms that remain subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. They are\ntherefore ambiguous as a matter of law, and we hold that the trial court did not err by implicitly\nfinding that the contracts are ambiguous.\n\n\n\n                                      b. Evidence of Parties' Intent\n\n [18] While the trial court did not make an explicit conclusion of law that the contract was\nambiguous, it implicitly did so because it made a finding of fact that the parties “intended to retain\nthe right to actual damages.” Chrysler argues in the last part of its second issue that there is no\nevidence to support the trial court's finding of the parties' intent because no witness provided parol\nevidence of the parties' intent concerning the damage waiver provisions since neither Manuel's\nattorney nor Chrysler's attorney—the only persons who drafted or negotiated wording changes in\nthe agreements—were asked any questions on this topic and because no changes were made in\nthe damage limitations in the agreements.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rather, the rule is that parol evidence of intent\nof the parties may be considered when the court has determined that a contract is ambiguous.\nPhiladelphia Am. Life Ins. Co. v. Turner, 131 S.W.3d 576, 587 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2004, no\npet.) (citing Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995), and\nSage *187 St. Assocs. v. Northdale Constr. Co., 863 S.W.2d 438, 445 (Tex.1993)). The primary\nand best evidence of the parties' intent remains the agreement itself, considered in light of all of\nthe surrounding facts and circumstances. See Emerald Tex., Inc. v. Peel, 920 S.W.2d 398, 402\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ) (citing City of Pinehurst v. Spooner, 432 S.W.2d 515,\n518 (Tex.1968)). The fact finder may consider other evidence that may be helpful in illuminating\nthe parties' true intent. Sw. Airlines Co. v. Jaeger, 867 S.W.2d 824, 829–30 (Tex.App.-El Paso\n1993, writ denied), disapproved of on other grounds by Dallas Market Ctr. Dev. Co. v. Liedeker,\n958 S.W.2d 382, 386–87 (Tex.1997), overruled, Torrington Co. v. Stutzman, 46 S.W.3d 829, 840\nn. 9 (Tex.2000). Moreover, parties do not ordinarily contract with reference to what happens if\nthere is a breach. “Parties generally have their minds addressed to performance of contracts—not\nto their breach or the consequences which will follow a breach.” See 24 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts § 64:15 (4th ed. 1999).\n\nIn this case, there is legally sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the parties\nintended to retain the right to actual damages, even though there is not specific testimony of\ntheir subjective intent regarding the limitation of damages provisions. That evidence included\nthe agreements themselves; the circumstances surrounding Chrysler's planning, negotiations, and\nimplementation of Project 2000; the sophistication and longstanding relationship of the parties;\nthe parties' negotiations; Chrysler's need for franchised dealers to be able to sell Chrysler's motor\nvehicles to the public; the purpose of the agreement for a franchise, which was for both Chrysler\nand Manuel to make profits from car sales; the overriding importance to success of the marketing\nplan such that each participating dealer agreed to waive the right to protest another dealer; and,\nfinally, the recognition by both parties that a protest might nevertheless be made and result in\nsignificant delay in opening the new dealership. 27\n\nChrysler agreed in the AESSA to grant a franchise to Manuel, and the AESSA specifically set forth\nChrysler's “planning potential” for Manuel's new dealership as 1,076 vehicles to be supplied by\nChrysler in the new dealership's first year so that Manuel could resell those vehicles to consumers.\nAs conditions required for Chrysler to grant Manuel the franchise, Manuel was to acquire suitable\nland for the construction of the dealership and provide building and site plans to be approved by\nChrysler for a facility—the minimum requirements for which were specifically set forth (excluding\na body shop) in the AESSA as 20,350 square feet of facility including a new vehicle showroom\nfor six vehicles, a parts department of 5,500 square feet, a service department of 11,500 square\nfeet with 22 service stalls, and 110,100 square feet of total land area. The AESSA stated these\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    36\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nrequirements were based upon Chrysler's “planning potential” of “1076 units” for the first year\nof operation of the dealership. Additionally, in November 2001, Chrysler prepared for Manuel a\n“Dealer Agreement Portfolio” including a document signed by Manuel and titled “DAP–3,” which\nforecast the new dealership's *188 net profit as $702,674 for its first year of actual operation\nbased upon Chrysler's estimated “planning potential” for the new dealership's first year of actual\noperation along with parts and service, minus expenses.\n\nJim Dimond, Chrysler's national market representation manager in 2000 and whose department\ndeveloped Project 2000, testified his department determined dealer planning potential. Chrysler\npurchased data on auto registrations from all parts of the country, demographic data with\npopulation and income levels, and counts of competitive dealers in market areas. Dimond\nexplained that “planning potential” is each market's share of “forward looking financial volumes.”\nAs Dimond noted, the AESSA cautioned that planning potential was not intended to predict the\nnumber of units that the dealer would sell or that Chrysler would sell to the dealer and that number\nmight change with market conditions. Nevertheless, he admitted that Chrysler used planning\npotential for the number of anticipated sales for the first year for a new franchised-dealership\nbecause it is “the best number if we have no track record.”\n\nDimond described the South Arlington area as a growing market with a strong population and\nincreasing income where Chrysler needed to establish more “points.” Dimond explained that the\nonly way that a dealer can sell cars in the United States and the only way a manufacturer can\ndistribute cars for sale to consumers is through a franchised dealership. As relevant here, the\nTMVC defines a “franchise” as one or more contracts between a franchised dealer as franchisee\nand a manufacturer (or distributor) as franchisor, in which: “(A) the franchisee is granted the\nright to sell and service new motor vehicles manufactured or distributed by the franchisor or to\nservice motor vehicles under the contract and a manufacturer's warranty” and “(D) the franchisee's\nbusiness substantially relies on the franchisor for a continued supply of motor vehicles, parts, and\naccessories.” Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 2301.002 (West 2008).\n\nVan Gray, Chrysler's national dealer placement manager in 1998 and 1999, testified that Chrysler\nwould not have undertaken the risky venture of slating a new dealership in the South Arlington area\nunless it thought the dealership could make money. It belabors the obvious to say that Chrysler and\nManuel were sophisticated parties in the automobile business and, as reflected by the agreements,\nthat both knew a protest from another dealer was possible and could result in significant delay.\nBut the AESSA placed the obligation to use best efforts to litigate or settle the protest on Chrysler\n(requiring only that Manuel cooperate with Chrysler) and provided that time was of the essence,\nand Manuel's actual damages could be no other than the profits he lost by reason of the delay\ncaused by Chrysler's failure to use its best efforts to litigate or settle the Meador protest. 28\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nConsidering the evidence favorable to the trial court's finding concerning the parties' intent if a\nreasonable factfinder could and disregarding evidence contrary to the finding unless a reasonable\nfactfinder could not, we hold that legally sufficient evidence supports the trial court's *189 finding\nthat the parties intended to retain liability for the damages awarded to Manuel in this case. See\nCent. Ready Mix Concrete Co., 228 S.W.3d at 651; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827. There was\nample evidence from which the trial court could reasonably have found that the parties intended\nto allocate the risk of delay from any protest to Chrysler such that it was to retain liability for “any\nactual damages” including Manuel's lost profits, rentals, or salary resulting from such a delay. We\ntherefore overrule Chrysler's second issue.\n\n\n\n                                   V. RELIABILITY OF EXPERTS\n\nBy its third issue, Chrysler contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the\ntestimony of Allen Wilkerson, Manuel's CPA, and Dr. James R. Vinson, Manuel's economist,\nregarding “lost profits” of the new dealership in this case because both experts' opinions were\nbased upon an unreliable methodology and foundation. Chrysler characterizes the testimony and\nopinions as falling into the “scientific testimony arena” subject to its Daubert/Robinson challenge\nand running objection to the testimony at trial. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S.\n579, 592–93, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2796, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co. v.\nRobinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 556 (Tex.1995).\n\nFor Manuel's primary damage model, his experts determined lost profits from the South Arlington\ndealership's delay in opening from November 2001 to November 2002 based upon actual data\nfrom Manuel Dodge (the Richardson dealership) for that period. Vinson referred to the damages\nmodel as the “business plan model,” which he said is accepted in the industry for financing and\nventure capital for projected profitability and which has been relied upon in other Texas cases.\n\nVinson testified that he asked Wilkerson to use Chrysler's online manual for the specific criteria\nper unit and the Richardson dealership's actual records during the same period regarding actual\nprofits and expenses as a “yardstick,” which he testified was the most comparable business to the\nSouth Arlington dealership because it was, like the South Arlington dealership, also a two-line\ndealership (after Manuel ceased selling the Chrysler line) that was actually in operation during that\nperiod, located in a similar area with similar demographics, and was under the same ownership\nand management.\n\nVinson chose the figure of 1,076 new units because Chrysler calculated that number as the\n“planning potential” for anticipated sales from that dealership for 2001 as a performance guideline\nbased on Manuel's historical experience of operating at or near Chrysler's planning potential.\nWilkerson performed the calculations comparing the proposed South Arlington dealership and the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nRichardson dealership, and he testified that the “adjusted forecasted income loss” to the South\nArlington dealership, because it was not open during 2001, was $864,468. Wilkerson also testified\nthat Manuel would have, in addition, personally earned an owner's salary of $475,632 and collected\nrent paid to him by the dealership entity in the amount of $600,000. Thus, Manuel's total net profit\naccording to Vinson and Wilkerson would have been $1,940,100 for the period that he could not\nopen the South Arlington dealership.\n\nChrysler challenged the admissibility of the testimony of both experts as being based upon an\nunreliable foundation and methodology, contending that: (1) their damage model was not an\nacceptable methodology for calculating lost profits; (2) neither witness considered actual sales\nof the new dealership after it finally *190 opened in 2002; (3) nor did they consider other\ncomparable dealerships in the area but instead used as their “benchmark” Manuel's own most\nsuccessful dealership from a different market for a “shining star year” of sales; (4) they relied upon\nChrysler's “planning potential” for 2001 to estimate future sales and did no independent market or\ndemographic analysis; (5) they failed to include start-up costs for the new business; and (6) they\nused estimates of Dodge sales to formulate opinions on Chrysler/Jeep sales.\n\n\nA. Reliability Test\n [19] We do not regard the Robinson test for reliability of scientific opinions to be applicable to\nthe expert opinions in this case. Instead, we hold that the general reliability test of Gammill is\nmore appropriate. Compare Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 556 (relying on Daubert and identifying\nsix nonexclusive factors for determining whether scientific evidence is reliable), with Gammill v.\nJack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 726 (Tex.1998) (holding factors listed in Daubert\nand Robinson cannot be applied to all expert testimony, but general requirements of Texas Rule of\nEvidence 702 for reliability still require trial court to determine whether testimony is supported by\nmore than credentials and ipse dixit of expert and to ensure that opinion comports with applicable\nprofessional standards and has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the discipline);\nsee also Paschal v. Great W. Drilling, Ltd., 215 S.W.3d 437, 448 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2006, pet.\ndenied) (holding Gammill test appropriate for expert testimony of a certified public accountant\nregarding analysis of financial records for tracing of embezzled funds).\n\n\nB. Methodology\n [20] Chrysler argues that the method utilized by Vinson for determining lost profits was improper.\nChrysler's own expert, however, did not testify that the methodology used by Manuel's experts was\nimproper, nor did he propose another method or calculate or offer an opinion as to what the actual\nsales for 2001 would have been for the twelve months that the South Arlington dealership was\nnot open. See KMG Kanal–Muller–Gruppe Deutschland GmbH & Co. v. Davis, 175 S.W.3d 379,\n396 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.)

See Formosa\nPlastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng'rs & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41, 50 (Tex.1998) (noting\nthat supreme court was “not retreating from our refusal to endorse one method for determining\nlost profits”) (citing Holt Atherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 85 (Tex.1992)). The\n“yardstick” method used by Vinson, consisting of a study of profits from business operations\nthat are closely comparable to that of a plaintiff, has been accepted for calculating lost profits\nand, in particular, for new businesses. See Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 500 F.2d 659, 667 (5th\nCir.1974) (recognizing “yardstick” and “before and after” as two generally recognized methods of\ndetermining lost profits as damages). Texas courts have accepted the yardstick analysis specifically\nfor determining lost profits from a new business by using a comparable established business that\nis also owned and operated by the plaintiff, as in this case. See, e.g., *191 Signal Peak Enters. of\nTex., Inc. v. Bettina Invs., Inc., 138 S.W.3d 915, 925 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2004, pet. struck) (holding\nexpert opinion proper for lost profits based on projected revenues minus projected operating\nexpenses for plaintiff's own existing business); America's Favorite Chicken Co. v. Samaras, 929\nS.W.2d 617, 629 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1996, writ denied) (describing model presented by expert\nas having intelligent, objective basis by taking into account historical operations of other franchises\noperated by plaintiff, potential for failure of new franchise, and other factors including plaintiff's\nexperience in the industry as well as historical data on his franchise operations); Pena v. Ludwig,\n766 S.W.2d 298, 303 (Tex.App.-Waco 1989, no writ) (holding reasonableness or reliability of\nmethodology went to weight and not admissibility where profits of established business of plaintiff\ncould serve as a reliable basis for calculating lost profits of new business; plaintiff was primarily\nresponsible for operating both shops and familiar with their management and financial condition,\nand factual data from established business provided sound basis for probable loss to new business).\nThus, we reject Chrysler's assertion that the expert testimony was unreliable because it was based\non the “yardstick” method.\n\n\nC. Foundational Data\nWe interpret Chrysler's remaining complaints in its third issue as challenging the underlying\nfoundational data relied upon by Vinson and Wilkerson. See Merrell Dow Pharms. v. Havner, 953\nS.W.2d 706, 712 (Tex.1997) (“The substance of the [expert's] testimony must be considered.... The\nunderlying data should be independently evaluated in determining if the opinion itself is reliable.”).\nIn this regard, Chrysler's complaints merge with a legal sufficiency type analysis for lost profits\ndamages. Once a plaintiff has chosen a particular methodology of evaluation, “recovery of lost\nprofits must be predicated on one complete calculation.” Holt Atherton, 835 S.W.2d at 85.\n\n [22] [23] [24] The amount of the loss must be proven by competent evidence with “reasonable\ncertainty” by whatever method is chosen, but the rule regarding such proof is intended to be\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n“flexible enough to accommodate the myriad circumstances in which claims for lost profits\narise.” Tex. Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Tex.1994)\n(reaffirming Sw. Battery Corp. v. Owen, 131 Tex. 423, 425–26, 115 S.W.2d 1097, 1098–\n99 (1938)). What constitutes reasonably certain evidence of lost profits is a “fact intensive\ndetermination.” Holt Atherton, 835 S.W.2d at 85. At a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost\nprofits must be based upon objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits\nmay be ascertained. Springs Window Fashions Div., Inc. v. The Blind Maker, Inc., 184 S.W.3d\n840, 884–85 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.) (op. on reh'g). Where\nestimates are based on objective facts or data and there are firm reasons to expect a business to\nyield a profit, recovery is not prohibited simply because the enterprise is new. Tex. Instruments,\nInc., 877 S.W.2d at 280. It is the activity that is the enterprise, and if the activity is well-established,\nthe fact that a newly formed entity is engaging in the activity will not preclude recovery. Id.\n\n\n1. Reliance on “Planning Potential”\n [25] In November 2001, before the opening of the dealership, Chrysler prepared and Mr. Manuel\nsigned a document introduced into evidence and referred to as a DAP–3, which projected net\nprofits for the first year of operation of the South Arlington dealership based upon the number\nof units Chrysler estimated for anticipated sales during the first year of actual *192 operation.\nChrysler now says that its estimate is “not reliable” and should not have been used by Manuel's\nexperts to project sales. However, Van Gray, Chrysler's own national dealer placement manager\nresponsible for placing, planning, and relocating dealerships, testified that planning potential is\na common methodology prepared and used by automobile manufacturers. In a new “green field\nmarket” such as South Arlington, it was the “best number” available to capitalize and plan a\ndealership. In an established market, he said, planning potential would be similar to minimum sales\nresponsibility. Gray further testified that Chrysler performs extensive market research as to where\ndealerships are to be located and as to what the planning potentials should be. Manuel's experts\naccepted that Chrysler had properly evaluated the market and the resulting anticipated sales based\nupon data researched by its market research company, Urban Sciences. They testified that planning\npotential is consistently used as an industry standard and concluded that it was reasonable to use\nthe planning potential assigned in the AESSA by Chrysler itself as the estimate for sales of new\nvehicles for that year by the dealership. Thus, the experts' reliance on Chrysler's planning potential\ndid not render their opinions unreliable.\n\n\n2. Comparable Dealership\n [26] Chrysler's expert (1) criticized Manuel's experts' use of Manuel's Richardson dealership's\noperation for 2001 as a comparable dealership by which to ascertain the new dealership's\nanticipated net profits for that year, (2) thought that Manuel's experts should have used subsequent\nactual years of operation for the new dealership, and (3) believed that Chrysler's number of units\nof 1076 was “too high” to use as estimated actual sales for that year. Manuel's experts, Vinson and\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                        41\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nWilkerson, testified that they forecast lost profits based upon the Richardson dealership during the\nsame time period because it was under Manuel's same experienced ownership and management\nin the same year that the South Arlington dealership was unable to open, because it sold two lines\nmade by Chrysler, as did the South Arlington dealership, and because the demographics were\ncomparable. Vinson and Wilkerson testified that they chose a dealership owned and managed\nby Manuel because using other dealerships would inject too many uncertainties and extraneous\nvariables into the comparison. Chrysler's dealer placement manager, Van Gray, agreed that\nmanagement by the dealer-principal is the most important factor in the profitability of a dealership.\n\nAdditionally, Vinson and Wilkerson testified that the Richardson dealership and Manuel's West\nLoop Dodge dealership were the only two of Manuel's dealerships that they could have used for\nthe year in question. They did not use the West Loop Dodge dealership in Fort Worth because\nit sold other lines of vehicles not manufactured by Chrysler, and it would have been extremely\ndifficult to separate out the expenses and revenues attributable to Chrysler vehicles. They did not\nuse Manuel's Lancaster dealership as a basis for comparison because Manuel did not own that\nstore during the relevant time period.\n\nChrysler also criticizes Manuel's experts' choice of using Manuel Dodge as its yardstick because\nthat dealership sold Dodge trucks, and the Dallas–Fort Worth area is the biggest truck market in\nthe world and more likely to be profitable for that reason. But Wilkerson testified that the gross\nprofit per vehicle was within the same range for both dealerships. He tested the damage model by\ncomparing it to gross profit per unit for other area dealers doing business in 2001 and concluded\nthat *193 the model was very conservative. We hold that the experts' reliance on the Richardson\ndealership as the most comparable dealership did not render their opinions unreliable.\n\n\n3. Applicable time period\n [27] Chrysler's argument that Vinson and Wilkerson should have used subsequent years of the\nSouth Arlington dealership's actual operation versus Manuel's damage model based on the 2001\nperiod during which the dealership was delayed in opening was arguably the most contentious\nsubject of the trial as to damages. The dealership opened in February of 2002. However, both\nChrysler's and Manuel's witnesses agreed that the years of 2000 and 2001 were exceptionally great\nyears for Chrysler sales in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, whereas the significant downturn in the\nautomobile market began in 2002, when registrations for Chrysler vehicles declined by 20 percent\nand profit for all dealers fell $8.2 million. The downturn was continuing at the time of trial. The\nSouth Arlington dealership had a loss of $482,000 in 2002. But Manuel's experts testified that\nlooking at actual performance in 2002 would not accurately reflect how the dealership would have\nperformed in 2001. Wilkerson testified that the difference between actual and projected sales was\n$1.1 million.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 42\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nEach of these areas of contention was hotly disputed. We cannot say that the trial court abused\nits discretion in admitting the expert testimony on this record. See Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.\nv. Mendez, 204 S.W.3d 797, 800 (Tex.2006) (stating trial court's determination of reliability of\nexpert's opinion reviewed for abuse of discretion). Chrysler's own estimate, reflected in its DAP–\n3 for Manuel's South Arlington dealership's net profit for its first year of operation, was $702,674.\nThe DAP–3 listed as “fixed expenses” a salary of $240,000 for Tommy Manuel and $540,000\nin rent to him for a total of $780,000 to Tommy Manuel, personally. The “actual damages” of\n$370,668.50 awarded by the trial court were well within the range of Chrysler's own estimate of\nnet profits as well as those of Manuel's witnesses.\n\nMoreover, even if there was an error in admission of the expert testimony, it was harmless. The trial\ncourt's finding as to damages is supported by the evidence as to the amounts for rental and salary\nestimated to be paid to Mr. Manuel by the dealership, which Vinson testified could be considered\neither as added to net profit or as fixed expense. See Springs Window Fashions, 184 S.W.3d at\n887 (holding evidence—also provided by Vinson—that significant portion of net income was\ndistributed to corporation's owner as compensation and benefits constituted evidence supporting\naward for lost profits for business otherwise operating at a loss) (citing Bettius & Sanderson, P.C.\nv. Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n [28] In its final judgment, the trial court awarded Manuel damages of $370,668.50 plus\nprejudgment interest of $126,425.88, calculated at the per diem rate of $83.78 and representing\n“prejudgment interest on past damages having accrued at the lawful rate of eight and one-quarter\npercent (8.25%) per annum from January 12, 2003 until the date of this judgment.” Chrysler\ncontends in its fourth issue that *194 the trial court erred in miscalculating the amount of\nprejudgment interest because it used an incorrect date of accrual (180 days after the date Chrysler\nreceived the first of two notices of a claim on July 16, 2002), incorrectly granting Manuel more\nthan $35,000 in unearned prejudgment interest.\n\n [29] [30] [31] For a breach-of-contract claim, prejudgment interest begins to accrue on the\nearlier of (1) 180 days after the date a defendant receives written notice of a claim, or (2) the\ndate suit is filed.

Id. “The abuse of discretion standard applies to the trial court's factual findings as they\nrelate to prejudgment interest; but the de novo standard applies to the trial court's application of\nthe law to the facts.” Id.; see also Figueroa v. Davis, 318 S.W.3d 53, 66 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st\nDist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\nChrysler does not contest the trial court's finding of fact that Chrysler received two written notices\nfrom Manuel, one on July 16, 2002, and the other on May 31, 2004. Chrysler's contention is that the\nfirst time it had notice of any claim against it for damages for breach of the AESSA or Settlement\nAgreement was Manuel's May 31, 2004 demand letter and that the July 16, 2002 written notice\nwas for an entirely different claim on which Manuel did not prevail in the trial court. Therefore,\nChrysler argues that the written notice of that other claim cannot constitute the date from which\nprejudgment interest was to run.\n\nIn the July 16, 2002 letter, Manuel asserted that Chrysler had orally agreed at the June 14, 2000\nstrategy meeting to dismiss its appeal in federal court and attempt to negotiate a settlement with\nMeador while Manuel sued Meador in state court for damages as a result of Meador's protest\nand that the Chrysler representatives present at the meeting “unanimously agreed” to reimburse\nManuel for Manuel's legal fees and expenses.\n\nPursuant to the alleged agreement reached at the meeting, Manuel filed suit against Meador in\nTarrant County District Court on July 12, 2000. Manuel continued the state court suit against\nMeador to a conclusion, claiming breach of contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel, and seeking\ndamages for lost profits, lost income, loss of opportunity, rental and salary. 29 Manuel eventually\nagreed to submit the case against Meador to binding arbitration, pursuant to which a take-nothing\njudgment was rendered against Manuel in June 2002.\n\nTommy Manuel testified that he hand-delivered a brown envelope to the Dallas zone manager\ncontaining his letter demand of July 16, 2002, together with documents consisting of hourly\nbillings by Manuel's attorney and his expert in that case, for reimbursement by Chrysler of his\nattorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with his state court litigation against Meador.\nChrysler denied any such agreement to reimburse Manuel for attorney's fees and expenses in the\nstate court litigation. After a series of discussions *195 and repeated oral demands by Manuel\nto Chrysler representatives, Chrysler notified Manuel by a February 26, 2004 letter that Chrysler\nwould not meet the demand for the attorney's fees and expenses. 30\n\nThe second demand letter of May 21, 2004, which Chrysler contends constitutes the only “written\nnotice” of Manuel's claim against Chrysler, reiterated Manuel's claim that Chrysler had agreed\nto pay his attorney's fees and expenses in prosecuting the suit in state court against Meador. But\nthe second letter also made demand for payment of the damages that Manuel had sustained as the\nresult of the delay in opening the South Arlington dealership, including lost profits.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  44\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n\nManuel relies upon Johnson & Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., in which the supreme\ncourt held that a stand-still agreement tolling the running of limitations for filing of a suit against\nJohnson & Higgins pending resolution of other litigation, rather than a later formal DTPA demand\nletter, was sufficient written notice of a claim against Johnson & Higgins for purposes of accrual\nof prejudgment interest. See 962 S.W.2d at 531. In particular, Manuel cites language of the court\nnoting that at the time of the stand-still agreement, Johnson & Higgins had sufficient information\nto obtain a settlement without incurring any prejudgment interest and that it was not necessary\nthat the document give specific notice to the other party, so long as it demands compensation or\nasserts a right to payment. See id. Manuel argues that the July 16, 2002 letter similarly sufficiently\nasserted his right to payment and points to the documents attached to that letter, which he describes\nas including documentation of other damages, including lost profits, as well as attorney's fee\nstatements and expert witness expenses. He also refers to testimony of a Chrysler representative\nabout possible settlement options with Manuel, including damages of over two million dollars\nbased upon that witness's own review of the July 16, 2002 demand letter.\n\nWe do not find Johnson & Higgins to be analogous to this case for several reasons. First, the\nstandstill agreement and the later DTPA letter in that case involved the same claim against Johnson\n& Higgins, not two separate claims as in this case. Secondly, the other litigation was ongoing at the\ntime the standstill agreement was entered into and arose from the same occurrence, so that Johnson\n& Higgins had ample notice of the nature of the claim. Thirdly, as the supreme court pointed out,\nthe “standstill agreement plainly says that ‘Kenneco asserts that, to the extent underwriters are\nfound not to be liable [in the federal action] ..., J & H is liable to Kenneco for the amounts which\nKenneco has claimed under the Policy.” Through the specific language of the standstill agreement,\nitself, it was clear that Kenneco was asserting a right to be paid for the same amounts claimed\nin the federal suit. Thus, Johnson & Higgins had sufficient information at that time to obtain a\nsettlement without incurring any prejudgment interest at all. See Owens–Illinois, Inc. v. Estate of\nBurt, 897 S.W.2d 765, 769 (Tex.1995) (“[A] defendant must have notice and an opportunity to\nsettle a claim.”).\n\nIn contrast, this case involved two separate claims under two different contracts entered into, if at\nall, at different times and related to different occurrences and suits. We agree with Chrysler that\nthe final judgment used the wrong date from which to calculate prejudgment interest. *196 The\nsubject of the letter of July 16, 2002, used by the court as the start date is not the claim on which\nManuel prevailed, and we can find no mention in that letter or in the accompanying documentation\nthat can be interpreted even to suggest a right to damages against Chrysler upon which this suit\nwas based. Prejudgment interest cannot be based on an unrelated claim arising from a different\nalleged contract (the alleged oral agreement of June 14, 2000), made under entirely different\ncircumstances (the strategy meeting of Chrysler and Manuel and their respective lawyers), and\nwhich was not a part of the contracts that were the basis of this lawsuit. The May 27, 2004 demand\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   45\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nletter for damages, which expressly references and demands damages for breach of the AESSA\nand Settlement Agreement against Chrysler, is the correct date of written notice. The date of the\nlater demand letter was less than 180 days before Manuel filed this suit on June 9, 2004. Therefore,\nthe accrual date for purposes of calculating prejudgment interest is June 9, 2004, the date on which\nManuel filed this suit. See Johnson & Higgins, 962 S.W.2d at 532. We sustain Chrysler's fourth\nissue. Calculating an 8.25% rate on $370,668.50 from June 9, 2004 to May 31, 2007 gives a total of\n$90,985.08. We modify the judgment to instead award only that amount of prejudgment interest.\n\n\n\n                                        VII. ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\nIn his cross-appeal, Manuel contends in four issues that the trial court erred by failing to award\nhim trial and appellate attorney's fees. Chrysler responds that the trial court did not err because\nMichigan law applies and does not permit recovery of attorney's fees for breach of contract actions,\nbecause the AESSA prohibits recovery of attorney's fees, and because an award of appellate\nattorney's fees is not mandatory.\n\n [32] A party can recover attorney's fees under civil practice and remedies code chapter 38 if\nthe claim is one listed in section 38.001, such as for breach of contract, and if the party (1) is\nrepresented by an attorney, (2) presented his or her claim to the opposing party or that party's duly\nauthorized agent, and (3) the opposing party did not tender the just amount owed within thirty\ndays. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. §§ 38.001, .002 (West 2008). If all of the statutory\nelements are established and there is proof of the reasonableness of the fees, an award of fees\nunder section 38.001 is mandatory. See AMX Enters., L.L.P. v. Master Realty Corp., 283 S.W.3d\n506, 516 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2009, no pet.).\n\n\nA. Trial Attorney's Fees\n [33] Chrysler does not dispute whether Manuel established each of the statutory elements but\ninstead contends that Manuel may not recover attorney's fees for other legal reasons. First, Chrysler\nargues that Michigan law applies and that Michigan law does not permit the recovery of attorney's\nfees in breach of contract actions. However, Chrysler did not file a motion or otherwise request that\nthe trial court take judicial notice of Michigan law until after the trial. While we do not hold that a\nmotion seeking judicial notice of the law of another state will always be untimely if filed after trial,\nChrysler's posttrial motion was untimely in this case. Choice-of-law matters may be waived, and\nwe hold that Chrysler waived its choice-of-law complaint in this case by failing to raise the matter\nbefore trial, by failing to object to the admission of evidence at trial concerning Manuel's attorney's\nfees, and by cross-examining Manuel's attorney about the segregation of attorney's fees, all of\nwhich are inconsistent with Chrysler's appellate *197 contention that Michigan law prevents the\nrecovery of attorney's fees in this case. 31 See Gen. Chem. Corp. v. De La Lastra, 852 S.W.2d 916,\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   46\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n920 (Tex.1993) (holding party waived application of maritime law to case “by failing to object to\nevidence and jury questions regarding damages which are not recoverable under maritime law”);\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Gunderson, Inc., 235 S.W.3d 287, 290 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth\n2007, pet. withdrawn) (holding trial court permitted to presume Texas and other state's law similar\nbecause party failed to file motion requesting judicial notice of other state's law).\n\n [34] Chrysler also argues that the AESSA's limitation-of-damages provision bars recovery of\nManuel's attorney's fees because it provides that the non-breaching party's sole remedy will be\nout-of-pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated. Chrysler reasons that Manuel waived any claims\nfor other damages and that attorney's fees are incidental damages. But Texas law provides that\nattorney's fees are more in the nature of costs than damages. See, e.g., Alma Grp., L.L.C. v. Palmer,\n143 S.W.3d 840, 846 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2004, pet. denied); see also Heliflight, Inc. v. Bell/\nAgusta Aerospace Co., LLC, No. 4:06–CV–425–A, 2007 WL 4373259, at *2 (N.D.Tex. Dec. 12,\n2007) (mem. op.). The AESSA does not purport to prohibit recovery of costs or attorney's fees\nin state court litigation. Therefore, we hold that the AESSA does not prohibit the recovery of\nManuel's attorney's fees.\n\n [35] Chrysler next argues that the trial court properly denied Manuel's request for attorney's fees\nbecause Manuel failed to segregate his attorney's fees between those incurred prosecuting claims\nfor which attorney's fees are recoverable and those incurred prosecuting claims for which attorney's\nfees are not recoverable. To support its contention, Chrysler relies on Green Int'l, Inc., 951 S.W.2d\nat 389, in which the supreme court stated: “A failure to segregate attorney's fees in a case containing\nmultiple causes of action, only some of which entitle the recovery of attorney's fees, can result\nin the recovery of zero attorney's fees.” However, this statement from Green Int'l, Inc. has been\ncharacterized as dicta and is inconsistent with a subsequent supreme court opinion which holds\nthat the failure to segregate attorney's fees does not bar all recovery of attorney's fees. See Tony\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 314 (Tex.2006) (“Chapa's failure to segregate\nher attorney's fees does not mean she cannot recover any. Unsegregated attorney's fees for the\nentire case are some evidence of what the segregated amount should be.”); see also Air Routing\nInt'l Corp. (Canada) v. Britannia Airways, Ltd., 150 S.W.3d 682, 693 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\nDist.] 2004, no pet.) (holding statement in Green concerning nonrecovery of fees for failure to\nsegregate is nonbinding dicta). Under Chapa, remand is the appropriate remedy so that Manuel\nmay offer evidence of the segregated amount of reasonable *198 and necessary attorney's fees.\nSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314.\n\nAs mentioned, Chrysler does not contend on appeal that Manuel failed to establish any of\nthe section 38.001 or 38.002 requirements, and it appears from our review of the record that\nManuel presented evidence of each statutory requirement. Indeed, Manuel presented evidence that\nreasonable and necessary attorney's fees in this case exceeded $480,000 through trial, with at least\nanother $125,000 for an appeal through the supreme court. Thus, even assuming that Manuel's\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  47\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v. Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\nattorney fee evidence consisted only of unsegregated fees, the trial court erred by failing to award\nhim any attorney's fees. See AMX Enters., L.L.P., 283 S.W.3d at 516 (stating section 38.001 fee\naward mandatory if statutory elements met and proof of reasonableness presented). We therefore\nsustain Manuel's first three issues and remand this case for a new trial concerning the segregated\namount of reasonable and necessary attorney's fees for Manuel's breach of contract claim.\n\n\nB. Appellate Attorney's Fees\n [36] Manuel contends in his final issue that the trial court erred by failing to award him any\nappellate attorney's fees, arguing that if an award of trial attorney's fees is mandatory under\nsection 38.001, an award of appellate attorney's fees is likewise mandatory. See End Users, Inc.\nv. Sys. Supply For End Users, Inc., No. 14–06–00833–CV, 2007 WL 2790379, at *6 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] Sept. 27, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing Lee v. Perez, 120 S.W.3d 463, 469\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (holding appellate attorney's fees mandatory if trial\nfees mandatory under section 38.001). Chrysler, citing several cases, responds that the factfinder\nmay award appellate attorney's fees but is not required to do so. See Anderson, Greenwood\n& Co. v. Martin, 44 S.W.3d 200, 221 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied); see\nalso Hunsucker v. Fustok, 238 S.W.3d 421, 431 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.);\nClements v. Minn. Life Ins. Co., 176 S.W.3d 258, 265 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.),\nsuperseded by statute on other grounds as recognized by State Farm Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, 216\nS.W.3d 799, 804 (Tex.2007); Neal v. SMC Corp., 99 S.W.3d 813, 818 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003,\nno pet.); Olivares v. Porter Poultry & Egg Co., 523 S.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio\n1975, no writ).\n\nAlthough Chrysler correctly cites the general rule that the factfinder may but is not required to\naward appellate attorney's fees, none of Chrysler's cases specifically addresses the scenario present\nhere—whether appellate attorney's fees are mandatory when trial attorney's fees are mandatory\nunder section 38.001 of the civil practice and remedies code. The Anderson court, although it\nstated the general rule, held earlier in the opinion that the fee claimant could not prevail on its\ncontract claim, meaning there was no basis for the recovery of any attorney's fees. See 44 S.W.3d\nat 221; cf. Lee, 120 S.W.3d at 469 n. 27 (distinguishing and declining to follow Anderson ).\nHunsucker concerned appellate attorney's fees for an appeal of an order dismissing a medical\nmalpractice suit for failure to file an expert report, see 238 S.W.3d at 423–24, 431, and Clements\naddressed an intervenor's attorney's fees under the insurance code. See 176 S.W.3d at 265–66.\nFinally, the Olivares court rejected the appellant's contention that appellate attorney's fees for\nbreach of contract and quantum meruit claims are never recoverable. See 523 S.W.2d at 732.\n\nOn the other hand, Manuel cites authority for the proposition that appellate attorney's *199 fees\nare mandatory if trial attorney's fees are mandatory under section 38.001. See End Users, Inc., 2007\nWL 2790379, at *6. In End Users, Inc., the claimant presented uncontested evidence that $30,000\nwas a reasonable fee for an appeal to the court of appeals and that $25,000 was a reasonable fee\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Unlike the End Users, Inc. court, though, we cannot simply modify\nthe trial court's judgment concerning the award of appellate attorney's fees because the evidence\nconcerning those fees was not conclusive. Therefore, we sustain Manuel's fourth issue but remand\nthis case for a new trial concerning the amount of Manuel's reasonable and necessary appellate\nattorney's fees. See World Help v.

In addition, having sustained each of\nManuel's four issues, we reverse the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding no attorney's\nfees to Manuel and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial concerning the amount of\nManuel's reasonable and necessary trial and appellate attorney's fees.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n362 S.W.3d 160\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Tommy J.

Currently, the regulatory function is performed by the Motor Vehicle Division of the Texas Department of Transportation,\n      and the substantive law is now codified as Chapter 2301 of the Texas Occupations Code. See, e.g., Tex. Occ.Code § 2301.001 (West\n      2004). Current sections of the occupations code referenced in this opinion correspond to sections of the former TMVC in effect at\n      the time of the events and suit that remain substantially unchanged.\n8     See id.\n\n9     See Tex.

But the trial court\n      specifically found that Chrysler failed to use its best efforts to resolve the Meador protest, a provision contained only in the AESSA.\n      The trial court had also previously granted summary judgment against Manuel for breach of the Settlement Agreement and made\n      no finding, and none was requested, that Chrysler failed to comply with paragraph 3 of the Settlement Agreement. Thus, we will\n      consider Chrysler's first issue on the merits.\n15    As Manuel notes, other Texas courts have encountered best efforts clauses in a variety of contracts without discussion of how such a\n      clause should be interpreted. See, e.g., Malatt v. C & R Refrigeration, 179 S.W.3d 152, 158 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2005, no pet.) (holding\n      best efforts clause did not require actual sale of machine but implying reasonable time); Aquila Sw. Pipeline, Inc. v. Harmony\n      Exploration, Inc., 48 S.W.3d 225, 233–34 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2001, pet. denied) (interpreting Section 2.306(b) of UCC, which\n      expressly imposes a best efforts standard upon the parties to a contract for exclusive dealing in goods).\n16    That Chrysler agreed to an extension of time for Manuel to establish and open the dealership when Meador's protest was not resolved\n      by that time is further indication that time was of the essence. See Siderius, Inc. v. Wallace Co., 583 S.W.2d 852, 864 (Tex.Civ.App.-\n      Tyler 1979, no writ).\n17    The decision of the federal district court to return the proceedings regarding validity of the protest waiver to the Commission seems\n      prescient, considering that it predated by less than a year the legislature's amendment of the TMVC to give the Commission original,\n      exclusive jurisdiction over issues regarding sale and distribution and other issues governed by the Code and to require abatement of a\n      suit seeking DTPA and other damages pending an administrative determination of Code-based issues that would govern the remainder\n      of the case. See Subaru of Am., Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 222 (Tex.2002) (interpreting legislature's\n      amendment to Section 3.01(a) of the Code, Act of May 18, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 155, § 5, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 313, 327).\n18    As mentioned above, the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law do not expressly state that Chrysler breached the AESSA\n      (as opposed to the Settlement Agreement), but only the AESSA contains a best efforts clause.\n19    Out-of-pocket expenses are reliance damages designed “to reimburse the plaintiff for expenditures made toward execution of the\n      contract, in order to restore the status quo before the contract.” See Foley v. Parlier, 68 S.W.3d 870, 884–85 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth\n      2002, no pet.) (contrasting reliance or out-of-pocket damages with expectancy or benefit-of-the-bargain damages).\n20    Despite the vast number of cases purporting to define “consequential damages” by repeating the same time-honored but general\n      definitions and distinctions between consequential and direct damages, the meaning remains elusive. See, e.g., T.Co Metals, L.L.C. v.\n      Dempsey Pipe & Supply, Inc., 592 F.3d 329, 341 (2nd Cir.2010) (citing White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 10–2 (5th\n      ed. 2006) (noting “reasonable persons often differ whether an item of damage is ‘consequential’ ”); Applied Data Processing, Inc.\n      v. Burroughs Corp., 394 F.Supp. 504, 508 (D.Conn.1975) (discussing Michigan law and stating neither in Michigan nor elsewhere\n      does the term “consequential damages” have a clearly established meaning); see also Glenn D.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n      Consequential Damages and Other Limitations of Liabilities, 33 J.C. & U.L. 1, 13 (2006) (stating “no one knows what consequential\n      damages are or may be, at least not with predictability or uniformity”).\n21    Chrysler intimates that the AESSA is only a letter of intent for which Manuel paid Chrysler nothing. But Manuel gave up his\n      longstanding, successful Chrysler line at his Richardson dealership (Manuel's lost profits that he would have received from the\n      Richardson dealership as the result of the delay while he waited to build and open his new dealership constituted his alternative\n      measure of damages) and agreed to waive his own rights to protest any other relocations or new dealerships in Project 2000. Moreover,\n      Chrysler has not argued that the AESSA was not binding, nor has it challenged the trial court's conclusion that the AESSA (as well\n      as the Settlement Agreement) is valid and enforceable. Letters of intent may be enforceable as valid contracts where parties agree\n      on material terms even where they leave open other terms for later negotiation. Foreca, S.A. v. GRD Dev. Co., 758 S.W.2d 744,\n      746 (Tex.1988) (holding intent to be bound is essential element of enforceable agreement); John Wood Grp. USA, Inc. v.

Petroleum Traders Corp., 261 S.W.3d 350, 359 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.)).\n23    See also Penncro Assocs., Inc. v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P., 499 F.3d 1151, 1156 (10th Cir.2007) (holding direct lost profits allowed\n      where clause provided “no consequential damages are recoverable includ[ing], but ... not limited to, lost profits, lost revenues and\n      lost business opportunities”).\n24    The Houston court contrasted those direct loss of profits from inability to sell the gas with profits lost on its contracts for sale of\n      electricity produced from the gas at its cogeneration facility, which would be consequential damages. Id. at n. 12; see also Tenn.\n      Gas, 2008 WL 3876141, at *8 (holding gas pipeline suffered consequential damages when sellers failure to timely deliver purchased\n      equipment prevented it from selling gas to its customers).\n25    Chrysler also argues that the waiver of “other compensatory damages” (in addition to the waiver of consequential damages) in the\n      AESSA is more specific and controls over the more general retention of liability for “actual damages” in the Settlement Agreement\n      (applying the specific-over-general rule of construction, so as to preclude recovery of all lost profits). But the ordinary meanings of\n      the terms “actual damages” and “compensatory damages” are that they are synonymous. See Tate v. Hernandez, 280 S.W.3d 534,\n      541 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2009, no pet.) (holding “actual damages” and “compensatory damages” have same meaning); Anderson v.\n      Alcus, 42 S.W.2d 294, 296 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1931, no writ) (noting “actual damages” are synonymous with “compensatory\n      damages”). Chrysler's only suggestion to resolve this conflict is to ignore the provision in the Settlement Agreement allowing recovery\n      of actual damages. Application of that rule of construction here would require that we simply disregard that provision in violation\n      of the basic rule that we avoid interpreting contracts so as to render terms meaningless. Second, we are at a loss to see how one\n      synonymous term can be more specific than another. Third, Chrysler overlooks the provision that the Settlement Agreement “prevails”\n      in the event of a conflict with the AESSA, so that the parties' retention of liability for “actual damages” in the Settlement Agreement\n      trumps the waiver of “other compensable damages” in the AESSA.\n26    Manuel, citing Wilburn v. Mo.-Kan.-Tex. Ry. Co. of Tex., 268 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1954, no writ) (op. on reh'g)\n      (stating that “[a] contract will not be construed to limit the remedial rights of the parties unless such an intention is clear”), argues that\n      the limitation-of-damages clauses are ambiguous, which renders them unenforceable. While we agree that the clauses are ambiguous\n      as discussed below, this rule of construction is inapplicable here because the contracts provide that their terms will not be strictly\n      construed against either party. Moreover, this rule of strict construction does not apply in the context of commercial contracts between\n      sophisticated parties. See Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 387 (Tex.1997) (holding no-damages-for-delay clause enforceable\n      in agreement between experienced parties familiar with such risk-shifting clauses).\n27    Moreover, a limitation or waiver of damages in a contract is an affirmative defense, so that Chrysler, rather than Manuel, had the\n      burden of proof to offer any parol or other extrinsic evidence that the parties' true intent was to preclude recovery of the damages\n      claimed by Manuel. See Leahy, 132 S.W.3d at 475; Regency Advantage Ltd. P'ship v. Bingo Idea–Watauga, Inc., 928 S.W.2d 56, 63\n      (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1995), rev'd in part on other grounds, 936 S.W.2d 275 (Tex.1996) (per curiam).\n28    The amount of damages awarded by the trial court was within the range of and less than half of Chrysler's own estimate and, as\n      indicated by the trial court in a letter to the parties, amounts to approximately four months' of lost profits. The amount could have\n      tied to the four-month period, from June 7, 2000, when the federal district court denied relief to Chrysler, to October 4, 2000, the\n      date of Chrysler's ultimate settlement with Meador.\n29    Contemporaneously with settling Meador's protest in late September or early October 2001, Chrysler offered to reimburse Manuel's\n      attorney's fees in connection with the suit against Meador if Manuel would immediately drop the suit against Meador, which offer\n      Manuel summarily rejected.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Manuel, 362 S.W.3d 160 (2012)\n\n\n\n30    Manuel did not prevail on its claim for those attorney's fees and expenses in this case in the trial court and has not pursued recovery\n      of those amounts by cross-appeal.\n31    One of our sister courts of appeals explained this rule as follows:\n           A court may take judicial notice of the laws of another jurisdiction at any point in a proceeding. The issue of a choice-of-law\n           determination is distinct from the court's power to generally take judicial notice of a foreign state's law. Thus, the mere fact\n           that the court may take judicial notice of foreign laws does not mean that choice-of-law issues may be raised at any point in\n           the proceeding. A preliminary motion is, therefore, necessary to assure the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

Roesch, P.C., Giddings, TX, for Respondents.\n\nD. Gibson Walton, Hogan Lovells US LLP, Houston, TX, for Amicus Curiae Texas Cable\nAssociation.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nDefendant Etan Industries, Inc. contends that the tort claims against it are barred by the two-year\nstatute of limitations. It also argues that the declaratory judgment against it was unwarranted. We\nagree and accordingly reverse and render judgment for Etan.\n\nEtan, a cable television and internet provider, had cable lines running on two properties owned\nby Ronald and Dana Lehmann (the Lehmanns). The properties were located on Highways 77\nand 290. Etan's cable lines were placed on poles belonging to Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative,\nInc., an electricity provider. Bluebonnet had easements on the Lehmann properties allowing it to\nplace and operate “an electric transmission or distribution line or system” on the properties. Etan\nand Bluebonnet 1 had written agreements known as joint use or pole attachment agreements. The\nagreements allowed Etan to make use of Bluebonnet's poles, but only “to the extent [Bluebonnet]\nmay lawfully do so,” and stated that Etan was responsible for obtaining its own easements and\nrights-of-way from property owners.\n\nThe Lehmanns purchased the Highway 77 property in 1986. At the time, Bluebonnet had lines\nrunning within an easement on this property. In December 2000, Etan hung a cable on Bluebonnet's\npoles. Ronald's brother Steven also owned property along Highway 77. Steven immediately\nnoticed Etan's cable on his own property and on Ronald's property, and notified Ronald. Steven\nthereafter had several conversations with employees of Bluebonnet and Etan, described below.\nSteven testified that he would always “fully apprise” Ronald of the conversations. Ronald likewise\nconfirmed that Steven “told me everything” about the conversations.\n\nRonald and Steven decided Steven would call Bluebonnet about the new line. The day after\nnoticing the line, Steven called Bluebonnet and was told the line belonged to Etan. Steven called\nEtan and spoke to Etan employee Jerry Smith. Smith told Steven that Etan had an easement and that\nSmith would send a copy of it to Steven. Steven waited for “a while” and called Smith back. Smith\ntold Steven he was having trouble locating the easement but would find it and send it. In Summer\n2001, Steven called Smith again. This time, Smith told Steven that Smith had been mistaken and\nEtan did not have an easement on the Highway 77 property. Smith claimed however that Etan had\nan oral agreement with Bluebonnet allowing Etan to use Bluebonnet's easements. According to\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 219\n\nRonald's testimony, Smith told Steven that Etan was “like in partnership” with Bluebonnet, and\nEtan could use Bluebonnet's easement. Based on this representation, “[w]e just dropped it.”\n\nIn December 2002, Ronald read a newspaper article about Marcus Cable Associates, L.P. v.\nKrohn, 90 S.W.3d 697 (Tex.2002). In that case, we held that an easement permitting an electric\ncooperative to construct and maintain “an electric transmission *622 or distribution line or\nsystem” did not allow a cable television provider under a joint use agreement to place cable\ntelevision lines in the easement. Id. at 699, 706–07. The Lehmann brothers both testified that\nthey understood the case to hold a cable company could not hang a communication line in an\nelectrical transmission easement. According to Steven, the Krohn decision “just threw up a red\nflag and I went to investigate it some more.” The brothers decided to contact Bluebonnet. In\nDecember 2002, Steven spoke to a Bluebonnet representative, who informed Steven that Etan\ncould use the Bluebonnet poles under the pole attachment agreements but that Etan was required\nto obtain its own easements from property owners. Bluebonnet informed Steven that without a\nseparate easement Etan was trespassing. Steven understood Bluebonnet's position—that Etan was\nrequired to obtain its own easements—to contradict Smith's earlier representation that Etan did not\nneed a separate easement. Ronald, likewise, understood that “[w]e had two conflicting stories.”\nBluebonnet told Steven that it would contact Etan “and try to get this thing worked out,” but Steven\nand Ronald did not hear back from Etan or Bluebonnet. Also during this time period, Ronald went\nto the courthouse to look for property records of easements. Ronald was not a lawyer but had some\nexperience conducting real estate transactions and reviewing real property records. He was unable\nto locate any Etan easements on his properties.\n\nSteven and Ronald eventually decided to contact a lawyer in mid to late 2003. The lawyer contacted\nBluebonnet and requested documentation regarding the easements on his clients' properties.\nBluebonnet informed the lawyer that locating the documents would take some time. In July 2004,\nthe lawyer received documents from Bluebonnet. No Etan easement was produced. The documents\nincluded Bluebonnet easements on the properties, and also included pole attachment agreements\nstating that “[e]ach party shall be responsible for obtaining its own easements and rights-of-way.”\nIn or about August 2004, Ronald and Steven met with their lawyer and reviewed the documents.\n\nSteven filed suit against Etan for trespass in December 2004. Steven's case settled in September\n2005. In October 2005, Ronald and Dana Lehmann filed suit pertaining to the Highway 290\nproperty. In April 2006, the Lehmanns added claims pertaining to their Highway 77 property.\nRonald testified that he waited to sue on the Highway 77 property because Steven had sued on his\nHighway 77 property, and Ronald decided to “watch and see” what happened in Steven's suit.\n\nThe jury rejected trespass and other tort claims pertaining to the Highway 290 property, and found\nthat Etan had obtained a prescriptive easement on this property.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 219\n\nWith respect to the Highway 77 property, the jury found that Etan had trespassed on and made a\nnegligent misrepresentation concerning this property. On the issue of limitations, the jury found\nin Question 5 that the Lehmanns filed their claims within two years of the date they discovered\nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury to their property. The\njury found in Question 6 that Etan fraudulently concealed its wrongful conduct pertaining to the\ntrespass and misrepresentation claims. It found in Question 7 that the Lehmanns knew or in the\nexercise of reasonable diligence should have known of Etan's fraudulent concealment on July 1,\n2004, the date their attorney received the above-described documents relating to the easements and\npole attachment agreements.

The court of appeals affirmed, with one justice dissenting. 308 S.W.3d\n489 (Tex.App.–Austin 2010).\n\n [1] [2] We agree with Etan that the Lehmanns' common-law tort claims were barred by\nlimitations. The applicable statute of limitations runs for two years from the day the cause of action\naccrues. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 16.003. Generally, a cause of action accrues when a\nwrongful act causes a legal injury. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211,\n221 (Tex.2003). The date a cause of action accrues is normally a question of law. Id.; Exxon Corp.\nv. Emerald Oil & Gas Co., 348 S.W.3d 194, 202 (Tex.2011).\n\n [3] [4] The Lehmanns contend that Etan's fraudulent concealment made their claims timely.\nA defendant's fraudulent concealment of wrongdoing can toll the running of the limitations\nperiod. Kerlin v. Sauceda, 263 S.W.3d 920, 925 (Tex.2008). However, even if we fully credit\nthe Lehmanns' contention that Etan misrepresented that it had a legal right to use the Bluebonnet\neasements, and assume without deciding that these statements can be characterized as a fraudulent\nconcealment under Texas law, the legal effect of that concealment does not extend the limitations\nperiod indefinitely. “The estoppel effect of fraudulent concealment ends when a party learns\nof facts, conditions, or circumstances which would cause a reasonably prudent person to make\ninquiry, which, if pursued, would lead to discovery of the concealed cause of action.” Borderlon\nv. Peck, 661 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex.1983); see also BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d\n59, 67 (Tex.2011).\n\nAs described above, in December 2000, the Lehmanns discovered that a cable had been placed on\ntheir property on the day it was placed there, and knew the next day that Etan had installed the line.\n\nIn December 2002, the Lehmanns learned about this Court's Krohn decision, and correctly\nunderstood it to hold that an electric utility's easement could not be used by a cable television\ncompany. Also by this date, (1) Etan had admitted to the Lehmanns that Etan did not have an\neasement on the property, (2) Bluebonnet had informed the Lehmanns that Etan needed its own\neasement to use the Bluebonnet poles on the Lehmanns' properties and that without a separate\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 219\n\neasement Etan was trespassing, (3) the Lehmanns knew they had received conflicting information\nfrom Etan and Bluebonnet, and (4) Etan had failed to produce, and Ronald had not independently\nuncovered, any documentation suggesting that Etan had a right to use the Lehmann property,\ndespite Etan's prior representations that it would provide such documentation.\n\nOn these facts, we hold as a matter of law that the estoppel effect of the alleged fraudulent\nconcealment ended in December 2002 at the latest. By that date, the Lehmanns were apprised of\nfacts, conditions, and circumstances sufficient to cause a reasonable person to make inquiry that\nwould lead to the discovery of the concealed cause of action. Because the Lehmanns did not file\nsuit until more than two years after this date, their claims were time-barred. See Kerlin, 263 S.W.3d\nat 925 (rejecting fraudulent concealment finding because, as a matter of law, plaintiff could have\ndiscovered existence of claims through reasonable diligence before limitations expired); Marshall,\n342 S.W.3d at 69 (same); Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 209 (concluding as a matter of law that\nassertion of fraudulent concealment was unavailing because plaintiffs had “actual knowledge of\nalleged injury-causing conduct” more than two years before filing suit); PPG Indus., Inc. v. JMB/\nHouston Ctrs. Partners Ltd. P'ship, 146 S.W.3d 79, 94 (Tex.2004) (holding that limitations begins\n *624 to run as a matter of law once claimant is on notice that “something is amiss”).\n\n [5] Etan also challenges the trial court's award of declaratory relief. The trial court awarded\na declaratory judgment stating that neither Bluebonnet's easements nor Etan's pole attachment\nagreements with Bluebonnet provided Etan with easements or other rights-of-way on the\nLehmanns' properties.\n\nEtan argues that the claims for declaratory judgment were moot because Etan had removed its\nlines from the Lehmanns' properties prior to trial. We agree. We have recently noted that a request\nfor declaratory judgment is moot if the claim presents “no live controversy.” Tex. A & M Univ.-\nKingsville v. Yarbrough, 347 S.W.3d 289, 290 (Tex.2011). We further explained that declaratory\nrelief is not warranted unless the claim presents a “substantial controversy” of “immediacy and\nreality.” Id. at 291 (quoting Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct.\n510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941)). The trial court had no reason to declare that Etan could not place lines\non the Lehmanns' property in the future, absent a reasonable basis for concluding that without a\ndeclaratory judgment Etan might do so in defiance of the court's judgment finding it liable for\ntrespass. We see no basis for reaching this conclusion on this record. Cf. Krohn v. Marcus Cable\nAssocs., L.P., 201 S.W.3d 876, 882 (Tex.App.-Waco 2006, pet. denied) (holding that property\nowner's request for injunctive relief against cable company was moot once the cable in issue was\nremoved).\n\n [6] The Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (UDJA) is not appropriately employed to remedy\na trespass occurring prior to trial that is the subject of a separate common-law trespass claim.\nAs the Lehmanns themselves describe the purpose of the Act in their brief, it is intended as a\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 7\n\fEtan Industries, Inc. v. Lehmann, 359 S.W.3d 620 (2011)\n55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 219\n\nmeans of determining the parties' rights when a controversy has arisen but before a wrong has been\ncommitted, “and is preventative in nature.” See Cobb v. Harrington, 144 Tex. 360, 190 S.W.2d\n709, 713 (1945) (describing Act as instrumentality wielded “in the interest of preventative justice,”\nand intended as a remedy “when a real controversy has arisen and even before the wrong has\nactually been committed”).\n\nFurther, the only apparent benefit to the Lehmanns from the declaratory judgment was the award\nof attorney's fees under the UDJA. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 37.009. We have\nheld that simply repleading a claim as one for a declaratory judgment cannot serve as a basis for\nattorney's fees, since such a maneuver would abolish the American Rule and make fees “available\nfor all parties in all cases.” MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669\n(Tex.2009). When a claim for declaratory relief is merely “tacked onto” statutory or common-law\nclaims that do not permit fees, allowing the UDJA to serve as a basis for fees “would violate the rule\nthat specific provisions should prevail over general ones.” Id. at 670. The declaratory judgment\nclaim must do more “than merely duplicate the issues litigated” via the contract or tort claims. Id.\n\nBy these standards the declaratory judgment and attorney's fees awarded thereunder were not\nwarranted. The declaratory judgment simply duplicated the issues litigated under the trespass claim\nby declaring, consistent with the Lehmanns' theory of trespass, that neither Bluebonnet's easements\nnor the pole attachment agreements between Bluebonnet and Etan gave Etan the right to place its\nlines on the Lehmanns' properties. We agree with the court of appeals' dissent “that declaratory\nrelief was improper because the declarations in this case add *625 nothing to what would be\nimplicit or express in a final judgment for the other remedies sought in the same action.” 308\nS.W.3d at 518 (Waldrop, J., dissenting). 2\n\nAccordingly, we grant Etan's petition for review, and without hearing oral argument, TEX.R.APP.\nP. 59. 1, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and render judgment that the Lehmanns take\nnothing on their claims.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n359 S.W.3d 620, 55 Tex.

J. 803\n\nallowed the lessee to purchase the equipment when the lease term ended. The trial court and the\ncourt of appeals agreed with the lessee's interpretation, but we agree with the lessor's. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the court of appeals' judgment, render judgment in part for the lessor, and remand the\ncase to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\nFrost National Bank purchased fourteen new delivery vehicles and leased them to Williams\nDistributors, Inc., a beer distributor. Frost and Williams entered into a sixty-month equipment\nlease agreement. 1 The lease's purchase option provision, known as a terminal rental adjustment\nclause, or TRAC, gave the lessee (Williams) the right to purchase the vehicles by giving the lessor\n(Frost) ninety days' written notice and provided for payment to be made “on the last day of [the\nlease's] Expiration [in] an amount in cash equal to the then Fair Market Value as hereafter defined\nin this section, of such Equipment.” The agreement then clarified that the lessor would collect an\namount equal to twenty percent of the original invoice price of the vehicles when they were sold,\nwhether to the lessee or to a third party; specifically, if the vehicles were sold to a third party, the\nlessor would pay the lessee any proceeds in excess of that amount, and, should the lessor receive\nless than the twenty percent from the sale, the lessee would owe the difference as a final rental\npayment.\n\nJust over a year into the lease term, Williams assigned the lease, with Frost's consent, to L & F\nDistributors, Inc., another beer distributor. Shortly thereafter, L & F notified Frost of its intent to\nexercise the purchase option. Before Frost responded, L & F sued Frost for a declaratory judgment,\nand L & F later amended its petition to add a claim for specific performance. L & F also sent Frost\na letter with a payment of $169,874.99, which amounted to twenty percent of the original invoice\nprice of the vehicles. Frost rejected and returned L & F's payment, refusing to sell the vehicles\nuntil the last day of the lease term, and also counterclaimed for declaratory relief and breach of\ncontract when L & F stopped paying rent on the vehicles. The parties agreed to narrow the scope\nof the dispute to the declaratory judgment requests and to limit Frost's claim for damages. Both\nparties filed motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe trial court partially granted L & F's motion for summary judgment and denied Frost's motion,\ndeclaring that Frost breached the lease agreement by refusing to sell the vehicles when L & F\ntendered payment. The trial court also awarded L & F its attorney's fees. The court of appeals\naffirmed, holding that the lease agreement was unambiguous and allowed L & F, as lessee, to\npurchase the vehicles with proper notice at any time on or before the end of the term. 2 122 S.W.3d\n922, 933.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In construing a contract, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties'\n *312 intentions as expressed in the document.

J. 803\n\n   paying to Lessor on the last day of such Expiration an amount in cash equal to the then Fair\n   Market Value as hereafter defined in this section, of such Equipment....\n\nThe court of appeals held that the purchase option provision (section 3(A) of the Optional\nProvisions) is unambiguous. 122 S.W.3d at 931. Specifically, the court of appeals noted that the\nfirst sentence allows L & F to buy the vehicles either on or before the expiration of the lease, the\nonly qualifications being that L & F cannot be in default, must buy all the vehicles, and must give\nFrost at least ninety days' notice of the purchase. Id. The court of appeals then held that the second\nsentence, which requires payment to be made “on the last day of such Expiration,” does not create\nan ambiguity or call for payment only at the end of the sixty-month lease term. Id.\n\nWere we to consider the purchase option provision in isolation, we might agree with the court\nof appeals' reading. However, when both sentences of the provision are properly considered in\nconjunction with each other and the rest of the agreement, particularly the contractual definition of\n *313 the term “Expiration,” the agreement unambiguously allows L & F to purchase the vehicles\nonly at the end of the sixty-month lease term. 3\n\nThe court of appeals ignored pertinent language in the lease schedule when it held that, should L\n& F choose to exercise the purchase option before the end of sixty months, the lease would simply\nexpire and payment would be due at the time of purchase. Id. The agreement specifically states that\nthe lease ends on the “Expiration” or “Expiration Date,” which occurs at sixty months. A different\ncontractual term, “Termination,” describes the agreement's being terminated on an earlier or later\ndate. By calling for payment “on the last day of such Expiration [of] an amount in cash equal to\nthe then Fair Market Value,” the agreement provides that, should L & F give the requisite notice\nof its intent to exercise the purchase option, it will pay Frost at the end of the sixty-month lease\nterm the then-fair market value of the vehicles, which will effectively come out to twenty percent\nof the invoice price. To reach the court of appeals' conclusion requires either substituting the\nword “Termination” for “Expiration” in the purchase option provision or amending the contractual\ndefinition of “Expiration,” neither of which is appropriate in construing an agreement.\n\nIn addition, L & F's and the court of appeals' construction is “unreasonable, inequitable, and\noppressive.” Reilly, 727 S.W.2d at 530. Such a construction allows the lessee to terminate the\nlease and purchase the vehicles for the same price (twenty percent of the original invoice price)\nat any point during the five-year lease term with the requisite notice. At the lessee's discretion,\nthen, the lessor would essentially have to forgo almost the entire rental value of the equipment and\nsell it almost new for twenty percent of its value, the same price it would receive for selling the\nequipment at the end of the lease term after collecting rent on it for sixty months. Bearing in mind\nthat our primary goal is to ascertain the intent of the parties when they entered into the agreement,\nwe find such a construction unreasonable. Because there is only one reasonable interpretation of\nthe lease, we construe it as a matter of law.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Michael Lillis is one of those producers, and he has sold gas from his\nwells to Kachina since at least 2001. In 2003, Kachina installed the Barker Central Compression\nStation on its pipeline. That compression allows Kachina to resell to Davis at its high-pressure\ninlet, for which Davis pays a higher per-volume price. Kachina installed additional compression\nin 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Kachina and Lillis entered into a new Gas Purchase Agreement naming Kachina as\n“Buyer” and Lillis as “Seller.” Under the Agreement, Lillis would transfer gas from his wells into\nKachina's gathering system at specified delivery points and Kachina would pay Lillis a percentage\nof the proceeds it obtained through resale to Davis. A producer can successfully deliver gas\nonly if its pressure is sufficient to overcome the working pressure in the gathering system, and\nthe Agreement addresses the parties' rights and responsibilities as to pressure. It specifies that\n“neither party hereto shall be obligated to compress any gas” but provides that “[i]f Buyer installs\ncompression to effect delivery of Seller's gas, Buyer will deduct from proceeds payable to Seller\nhereunder a value equal to Buyer's actual costs to install, repair, maintain and operate compression\nplus 20% of such costs to cover management, overhead and administration.”\n\nThe Agreement provides it is effective for an “initial period” expiring May 2010, at which point\nit continues month-to-month and is cancelable by either party upon thirty days' notice. “Upon\ntermination or cancellation of [the] Agreement, prior to Seller selling gas to a third party,” Kachina\nhas the option to “continue the purchase of gas under the terms of [the] Agreement with such\nadjustments in the price hereunder as may be required to yield the same economic benefit to Seller,\nas would be derived from the proposed third[-]party offer.”\n\nKachina bought, transported, and resold Lillis's gas according to the Agreement. It deducted from\nLillis's share of the proceeds “marketing fees,” which included his pro rata share of compression\ncosts. In 2008, Lillis entered into a purchase agreement directly with Davis and constructed his\nown pipeline to its plant. Around the same time, he objected to the compression fees Kachina had\nbeen deducting.\n\n *2 Lillis then sued, asserting that the Agreement did not authorize deduction for compression\noccurring after he delivered the gas to Kachina and that Kachina thus breached the Agreement\nby deducting those compression fees. He sought a declaration that Kachina was in breach and an\naccounting. He also brought a fraud claim, asserting that Kachina represented it would release him\nfrom the Agreement and that he built the new pipeline in reliance on that representation. Kachina\ncounterclaimed, asserting Lillis breached the Agreement by failing to notify it of Davis's third-\nparty offer. Kachina sought declarations that it had the right to deduct compression charges under\nthe Agreement and that it exercised its option, extending the Agreement's term through May 2015.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lillis, --- S.W.3d ---- (2015)\n2015 WL 5889109\n\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment, with Kachina filing a no-evidence motion for partial\nsummary judgment on the fraud claim and a motion for traditional partial summary judgment on\nthe declarations it sought. The trial court denied Lillis's motion for summary judgment and granted\nboth of Kachina's, ordering that Lillis take nothing on his claims. The court declared in its final\njudgment that Kachina “has the right under the 2005 Gas Purchase Agreement to deduct from\n[Lillis's] monthly net proceeds compression costs” and that Kachina “duly exercised its option\nrights under the 2005 Gas Purchase Agreement so that the termination date of the Agreement has\nbeen extended to May 31, 2015.” It further awarded Kachina attorney's fees and expenses.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed those declarations.

See Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2003). Under\nthe traditional standard for summary judgment, the movant has the burden to show that no genuine\nissue of material fact exists and that judgment should be granted as a matter of law. TEX. R.

The construction of an unambiguous contract is a question\nof law, also reviewed de novo. Tawes v. Barnes, 340 S.W.3d 419, 425 (Tex.2011). When the\nagreement as written is ambiguous, however, the parties' intent becomes a fact issue. See Italian\nCowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323, 333 (Tex.2011).

Lillis, --- S.W.3d ---- (2015)\n2015 WL 5889109\n\nWhether the trial court properly declared the Agreement authorized deduction of the disputed costs\ndepends on whether the compression-cost provision applies to the compression here. Kachina's\ndeductions included Lillis's share of total system compressor costs, based on the proportion of\ngas moved through the system that originated from his wells. The Barker station was in place and\noperating at the time the parties entered into the Agreement. In 2007, Kachina added compression\nequipment to “enhance operations and move more gas through the system for delivery to Davis,”\naccording to Kachina's president.\n\n *3 Kachina argues the provision authorizes deductions for any compression that aids in the final\ndelivery to Davis of gas bought from Lillis. Under this interpretation, Kachina rightfully deducted\nLillis's share of the costs of all compression. Lillis, on the other hand, argues the provision's plain\nlanguage allows deductions only for compression that Kachina installs if Lillis fails to deliver\nat pressures that overcome Kachina's working pressure at the point of transfer. He thus argues\nKachina must show (1) Lillis has become unable to deliver against Kachina's working pressure, and\n(2) the compression equipment was installed after the Agreement's execution. This interpretation\nwould preclude deduction for the pre-existing compression at the Barker station. And though the\ncompression added in 2007 would satisfy Lillis's second requirement, Kachina does not argue and\nthe record does not support it was installed because one of Lillis's wells failed to deliver.\n\n“In construing a contract, a court must ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the\nwriting itself.” Italian Cowboy, 341 S.W.3d at 333. We may consider the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding a contract, including “the commercial or other setting in which the contract was\nnegotiated and other objectively determinable factors that give context to the parties' transaction.”\nAmerico Life, Inc. v. Myer, 440 S.W.3d 18, 22 (Tex.2014). But while evidence of circumstances\ncan be used to “inform the contract text and render it capable of only one meaning,” extrinsic\nevidence can be considered only to interpret an ambiguous writing, not to create ambiguity. See,\nrespectively,id.; Friendswood Dev. Co. v. McDade & Co., 926 S.W.2d 280, 283 (Tex.1996). “A\ncontract is not ambiguous simply because the parties disagree over its meaning.” Dynegy, 294\nS.W.3d at 168. Rather, “[i]f a written contract is so worded that it can be given a definite or certain\nlegal meaning, then it is not ambiguous.” Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v.

Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983)).\n\nApplying these rules of interpretation, we agree with Lillis that the provision unambiguously\nallows Kachina to deduct only the costs of compression installed during the term of the Agreement\nif required to overcome the working pressure in Kachina's system. A paragraph titled “Delivery\nPoint” defines the point of transfer:\n\n   Seller agrees to deliver and Buyer agrees to receive the gas deliverable hereunder at the outlet of\n   Buyer['s] ... metering facilities to be located at a mutually agreeable point(s) at or near Seller's\n   well(s). Such point shall constitute the delivery point for all gas to be delivered hereunder.\n\nThe next paragraph provides, “Title of all gas delivered hereunder shall pass to Buyer at the\ndelivery point.” A paragraph titled “Pressure” generally addresses the pressure differential at that\npoint:\n\n   Pressure: Seller shall deliver the gas deliverable hereunder, at the above [-]described delivery\n   point at a pressure sufficient to enter Buyer's pipeline against the working pressure maintained\n   therein from time to time. Seller will regulate its[ ] pressures so as to not exceed the maximum\n   allowed operating pressure (MAOP) as set from time to time by Buyer for deliveries into\n   Buyer's gas pipeline. However, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither party hereto\n   shall be obligated to compress any gas under the terms of this Agreement and if the well is\n   no longer capable of delivering gas against the working pressures maintained at the delivery\n   point and neither party elects to install a compressor, then Buyer shall, upon request from\n   Seller, release such well and the gas produced therefrom from the terms and provisions of this\n   Agreement. If Buyer installs compression to effect delivery of Seller's gas, Buyer will deduct\n   from proceeds payable to Seller hereunder a value equal to Buyer's actual costs to install,\n   repair, maintain and operate compression, plus 20% of such costs to cover management,\n   overhead and administration.\n\n*4 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Pressure paragraph recognizes transfer into Kachina's line depends on the producer's well's\npressure being sufficient to overcome Kachina's working pressure, and it imposes the duty to\nmaintain sufficient pressure on the producer. If a well fails to overcome Kachina's working\npressure, the paragraph gives Kachina two options. It may do nothing, in which case the well\nwill be released from the Agreement. Or it may elect to install compression so that the well can\novercome the working pressure. If Kachina elects the latter, it has the right to deduct costs incurred.\n\nThe contingent nature of that right is unavoidable—it arises only “[i]f [Kachina] installs\ncompression to effect delivery.” See Solar Applications Eng'g, Inc. v. T.A. Operating Corp., 327\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   5\n\fKachina Pipeline Company, Inc. v. Lillis, --- S.W.3d ---- (2015)\n2015 WL 5889109\n\nS.W.3d 104, 109 (Tex.2010) (“In order to make performance specifically conditional, a term such\nas ‘if’ ... or some similar phrase of conditional language must normally be included.” (quoting\nCriswell v. European Crossroads Shopping Ctr., Ltd., 792 S.W.2d 945, 948 (Tex.1990))). We\nmust reach two conclusions to make sense of this contingent phrasing. First, it does not apply\nto preexisting compression. It makes little sense that the parties would have made deductions\ncontingent on installation if they intended the provision to also cover the compression already\nin place at the time of the Agreement. Second, only compression installed for the purpose of\novercoming Kachina's working pressure is installed to “effect delivery.” The sentence immediately\npreceding the compression-cost provision contemplates a scenario in which “a well is no longer\ncapable of delivering gas against the working pressures” and “neither party elects to install a\ncompressor.” Generally, well pressure tends to diminish over time as the reservoir is depleted;\nthe Pressure paragraph creates an elective scheme that addresses this reality. Indeed, the ordinary\nmeaning of the verb “effect” is “to bring about; to make happen.” BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY\n628 (10th ed.2014). If a well's natural pressure is sufficient to overcome the working pressure at\nthe delivery point, added compression can hardly be said to bring about delivery that would occur\nwithout it. To construe the compression-cost provision to apply to any compression would ignore\nits plainly contingent language and the elective scheme it creates.\n\nKachina argues that “delivery” includes final delivery to a third party—here, Davis—because\nthe provision does not expressly limit “delivery” to mean only transfer into its system. When\nconsidering the Agreement as a whole and the specific context in which the provision appears,\nthis cannot be so. The Agreement does not define the term “delivery,” but it uses “deliver”\nor “delivery” dozens of times throughout, almost exclusively to refer to transfer from Lillis to\nKachina. And, as discussed, the Pressure paragraph containing the compression-cost provision\nspecifically addresses pressure issues at those points of transfer.\n\n *5 In contrast, the Agreement refers to re-delivery to a third party only twice. Once is in\na paragraph titled “Reservation of Gas by Buyer,” which allows Kachina to except from the\nAgreement gas to operate compression that is “required to provide gas to third[-]party purchasers.”\nThus, the Agreement contemplates Kachina may need to compress the gas for resale, but it uses\nthe term “provide” rather than “deliver.” And though Kachina may use gathered gas to fuel that\ncompression, the provision is silent as to who bears the compression's cost. The other usage is in\nthe price provision, which sets the price based on the net volume “delivered to and resold by the\nBuyer based on the price received by the Buyer for resale of same said gas delivered at the outlet of\nthe Buyer's System.” That single usage of “delivery” to refer to transfer to a third-party purchaser\nat the outlet of Kachina's system cannot outweigh the consistency with which it is otherwise used\nthroughout the Agreement and in the compression provision's specific textual environment.\n\nKachina's fall-back position is that even if “delivery” means transfer at the delivery point and\nnot to the Davis plant, the Barker compressor “effects delivery” by creating a suction, thereby\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lillis, --- S.W.3d ---- (2015)\n2015 WL 5889109\n\nlowering the upstream pressure and aiding the flow of gas through the delivery point and\ninto Kachina's line. The CHIEF JUSTICE agrees. While we do not question that downstream\ncompression may function as Kachina suggests, that factual assertion does not help interpret the\nAgreement's language. Both Kachina and the CHIEF JUSTICE assume any compression that aids\nin delivery “effects delivery.” But, respectfully, neither offers an alternative interpretation of the\ncontract language that would harmonize this position with the provision's contingent phrasing\nand immediate context. See FPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Mgmt. Co., 426 S.W.3d 59, 63\n(Tex.2014) (“We consider the entire writing to harmonize and effectuate all provisions such that\nnone are rendered meaningless.”).\n\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE also states that the evidence shows that Lillis would not be able to deliver to\nKachina without compression. We disagree. Compression is clearly necessary for re-delivery to\nDavis's high-pressure intake, but the record shows Davis can also take low-pressure sales at less\nthan 50 pounds per square inch gauge. Lillis delivers to Kachina at 50 and 80 pounds per square\ninch gauge, and the record establishes gas could flow from the leases through Kachina's line and\nto Davis without compression if Kachina had not opted for the high-pressure sale. In any case, the\nsummary-judgment burden is Kachina's, and Lillis need not establish the compression here was\nnot necessary for delivery to Kachina.\n\nThe Pressure paragraph acknowledges Kachina's options if faced with an underpressurized well\nand shifts costs of compression installed to remedy such a situation. But there is no evidence in\nthe record presented that Kachina ever faced an underpressurization issue. The record supports\nonly that Kachina constructed the Barker compression station to take advantage of the higher price\nDavis pays for high-pressure resales and added the 2007 compression to increase the amount of\ngas gathered and transported. The Agreement does not address these decisions.\n\nWe do not mean to say, however, that the compression's location is determinative. The court\nof appeals held that “the provision does not expressly speak to whether Kachina may seek\nrecovery for compression that occurs after gas has been transferred.” 2013 WL 3186261, at *8.\nWe disagree with the court's implicit assumption that compression occurring on Kachina's side\nof the delivery point cannot “effect delivery.” As Kachina and two pipeline-industry amici point\nout, compression not only increases downstream pressure, it reduces upstream pressure, which\ncan decrease the working pressure at the delivery points to facilitate transfer from a low-pressure\nwell. See, e.g.,Parker v. TXO Prod. Corp., 716 S.W.2d 644, 645 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 1986,\nno writ) (noting pipeline operator “installed compressors to better deliver the gas from the wells\ninto [its] pipeline system”). If a well fails to deliver, Kachina can effect delivery by decreasing\nthe working pressure in that manner. The provision allows deductions only for compression that\nserves that purpose, but it does not speak to the compression's location. In fact, the Agreement\nprovides Lillis has “exclusive control and possession of the gas deliverable hereunder” until title\ntransfers at the delivery point, and it gives Kachina no right to install any equipment upstream from\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals' implied limitation would effectively require the parties to\nact beyond the rights the Agreement affords in order to give the provision effect.\n\n *6 The record reflects that Kachina had been deducting compression costs as part of its marketing\nfees since at least 2003 under the 2001 contract. Kachina points to Lillis's acquiescence to\nthose fees as evidence that he knew he would share those costs. The 2001 compression-cost\nprovision was written more broadly than its counterpart in the 2005 Agreement, however, and\nsuch acquiescence does not establish a course of dealing that supports Kachina's interpretation.\nSeeTEX. BUS. & COM. CODEE §§ 1.303(b), 2.202(1) (defining course of dealing and allowing\ncourse of dealing to explain express terms). The 2001 contract allows deduction of a compression\nfee “[s]hould Seller at any Point of Delivery deliver gas into one of Buyer's pipelines whereon\ncompression facilities are installed.” That provision would certainly apply to all compression here.\nThat the provision's language changed so drastically between the 2001 and 2005 contracts supports\nour interpretation of the Agreement's language. The CHIEF JUSTICE argues it makes no sense\nthat Lillis would cease to assume his share of costs. But our task is to interpret the Agreement's\nlanguage, not to justify the bargain it memorializes. See FPL Energy, 426 S.W.3d at 65 (“We must\nrespect and enforce this [contract's] assignment of risk.” (citing Gym–N–I Playgrounds, Inc. v.\nSnider, 220 S.W.3d 905, 912 (Tex.2007))).\n\nIn support of its contention that Lillis understood the Agreement allocated his share of costs of all\ncompression, Kachina also points to Lillis's continued acquiescence to the marketing fees under\nthe 2005 Agreement as well as deposition testimony in the record that suggests Lillis understood\nhe would be allocated compression costs under the Agreement. A party's interpretation of an\nagreement is parol evidence and cannot be used to create ambiguity or show motive. Anglo–\nDutch Petroleum Int'l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d 445, 452 (Tex.2011); see\nalso Italian Cowboy, 341 S.W.3d at 333–34 (“Only where a contract is ambiguous may a court\nconsider the parties' interpretation ....” (quoting David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447,\n450–51 (Tex.2008) (per curiam))). Both Lillis's acquiescence and his testimony are evidence of\nsubjective intent that we cannot consider to contradict the provision's unambiguous legal meaning.\nSun Oil Co. (Del.) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex.1981) (holding method of accounting\nin administering a contract was inadmissible evidence of a party's interpretation).\n\nAmici have made it clear that downstream centralization of compression is both common and\ncritical to the efficient transportation of gas to market. We do not doubt that, and we do not\ndoubt that producers often contract to share in such costs. But the Agreement does not express an\nobjective intent that Lillis would do so, and industry custom cannot impose obligations beyond\nthose within the written Agreement. See Nat'l Union, 907 S.W.2d at 521–22 (refusing to consider\nevidence of industry-wide discussions because it directly conflicted with express language).\nAbsent evidence that compression installed during the term of the Agreement was required to\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lillis, --- S.W.3d ---- (2015)\n2015 WL 5889109\n\novercome the working pressure in Kachina's system, the Agreement does not authorize Kachina\nto deduct compression costs. The trial court erred to the extent it declared otherwise.\n\n\n\n                                                             B\n\nThe Agreement's term provision requires Lillis to give Kachina notice of any purchase offer made\nby a third party, and it gives Kachina the option to “continue the purchase of gas under the terms\nof this Agreement with such adjustments in the price hereunder as may be required to yield the\nsame economic benefit to [Lillis], as would be derived from the proposed third [-]party offer.” The\ncourt of appeals correctly decided this provision does not support a five-year extension.\n\nKachina argues the provision's language supports such an extension because the five-year initial\nperiod is a “term of this Agreement.” Certainly, in exercising its option, Kachina remains bound\nby the Agreement's original terms. But the option right granted is not the right to a new or renewed\nagreement; it is the right to continue the purchase of gas under the Agreement's terms. The five-\nyear initial period is one of those terms. Another is that the Agreement would become month-to-\nmonth in May 2010. The express language does not subject the parties to a new agreement with\na new initial term.\n\n *7 Kachina points to the proposed agreement between Lillis and Davis, which it says also sets\na fixed price for a five-year term. The provision, however, allows adjustments only in price\nbased on the outside third-party agreement. It does not import any other term from a third-party\noffer. Kachina's rights are confined to the Agreement regardless of the content of the Lillis–Davis\nagreement, price notwithstanding.\n\nKachina argues that because the market price of gas fluctuates, a new five-year term is required\nto confer the same economic benefit on Lillis as he would have received through his deal with\nDavis. While it may be true that generally a contract's economic value is to some extent a function\nof its term period and that our interpretation should be informed by that commercial context,\nthe plain language here still does not entitle Kachina to an additional five-year term. Further,\nthe provision protects Lillis by ensuring he receives the economic benefit of any outside deal he\nprocures after rightfully cancelling or terminating the contract. It does not confer any additional\nrights on Kachina, and to construe it as forcing Lillis into an extended commitment runs contrary\nto its purpose.\n\nFinally, Kachina argues our construction yields the absurd result that Lillis may cancel the\nAgreement every month, requiring Kachina to perpetually exercise its option. The reality,\nhowever, is not so absurd. While Lillis is entitled to cancel on the first day of any month once\nthe initial term expired, his only reason to do so would be that a third party had offered a\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The provision recognizes that Lillis may pursue a better deal, and it indeed requires\nKachina to match that deal if it is to continue purchasing from Lillis. Kachina, however, insists the\nbusiness of natural-gas transportation requires substantial upfront investment in equipment and\nmaintenance and therefore is not suited to such an unpredictable short-term arrangement. Those\ngeneral concerns are not implicated here where Kachina's upfront investment has already taken\nplace. Kachina has had the initial five-year commitment to secure a return on that investment, and\nit could have specifically contracted for a longer fixed term if the economics required. The option\nprovision does not render the month-to-month term any more at odds with industry realities than\nit is on its own.\n\nThe trial court's declaration that Kachina extended the term of the Agreement to May 31, 2015, is\ninconsistent with the Agreement's express language, and the court of appeals correctly reversed it.\n\n\n\n                                                            III\n\nBecause the court of appeals correctly reversed the trial court's declarations, its reversal of the\nattorney's-fees award and remand to the trial court on the issue were proper. Kachina argues that\nbecause it prevailed on several issues and because some of the declarations concerning the contract\nissues remain intact, reversal of the entire fee award is error. Under the Uniform Declaratory\nJudgments Act, a trial court has discretion to award costs and attorney's fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM. CODEE § 37.009. When an appellate court reverses a declaratory judgment, it may reverse\nan attorney's fee award, but it is not required to do so. SAVA gumarska in kemijska industria d.d.\nv. Advanced Polymer Scis., Inc., 128 S.W.3d 304, 324 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2004, no pet.) (“[A]fter a\ndeclaratory judgment is reversed on appeal, an award of attorneys' fees may no longer be equitable\nand just.”). Kachina may be correct that there remain grounds on which a trial court may award\nfees. But because we decide Kachina did not prevail on two of the primary issues in dispute, we\nremand the issue to determine the appropriate award of costs and fees.\n\n *8 Kachina also asserts that Lillis inadequately briefed the attorney's-fees issue at the court of\nappeals and thus waived the issue. There, Lillis requested remand of the issue of fees and costs “if\nthe Court sustains one or more of its declaratory-judgment challenges.” “[W]e liberally construe\nissues presented to obtain a just, fair, and equitable adjudication of the rights of the litigants.” El\nPaso Natural Gas Co. v. Minco Oil & Gas, Inc., 8 S.W.3d 309, 316 (Tex.1999). Lillis phrased\nthe request conditionally and presented it in a footnote, but he nonetheless made the request and\npreserved the issue. The issue was properly before the court of appeals, just as it is properly before\nus.\n\n***\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1221\n\n\nOpinion\n\n*663 Justice BRISTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSince Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, 1 there have been charges that some cases benefit the lawyers more\nthan the clients. But suits cannot be maintained solely for the attorney's fees; a client must gain\nsomething before attorney's fees can be awarded. While making losing parties bear their own\nattorney's fees may add injury to insult, the American Rule has long been that each party pays\nits own lawyers.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff obtained a judgment for $1,000 in damages and almost $150,000 in\nattorney's fees. But there was no evidence to support the amount of the $1,000 award, and it is too\nlarge to constitute nominal damages. As the award to the client must be set aside, the attorney's\nfee award must also. Accordingly, we reverse and render a take-nothing judgment.\n\n\n\n                                               I. Background\n\nThe Woodlands Operating Company leased the 19 copiers at issue here from MBM Financial\nCorporation 2 and installed them in late 2000 and early 2001. Each machine was covered by a\nseparate four-year lease, with annual renewals thereafter unless notice was sent between 90 and\n180 days before the end of the existing term. The leases required the Woodlands to return the\ncopiers to a location MBM specified.\n\nThe Woodlands decided not to renew the leases in mid–2004 and asked MBM for the end-of-\nterm dates and instructions for return. MBM employees provided the dates and approved a draft\ntermination letter from the Woodlands. But when the actual termination letter arrived (viewing\nthe evidence in the light favorable to the trial court's judgment), 3 MBM's president unilaterally\nchanged the dates so the notice would be untimely and demanded rent for another year. To bolster\nMBM's position, he signed the leases and inserted commencement dates for the first time after\nthe Woodlands filed suit. Until suit was filed, MBM also refused to designate a return location\nfor the bulky equipment.\n\nThe Woodlands sued, asserting claims for breach of contract, fraud, and declaratory relief. MBM\ncounterclaimed for additional rent of $160,000, though it later dropped that claim. After a two-\nday bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment awarding the Woodlands $1,000 in damages and\n$145,091.59 in attorney's fees through trial. The court of appeals affirmed the damages and part\nof the fee award. 4 On appeal, MBM challenges both.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1221\n\n\n\n\n                             II. Nominal Damages & Breach of Contract\n\n [1] At trial, the Woodlands requested only nominal damages. The judgment describes the $1,000\naward as “actual damages,” but the trial court's findings and conclusions describe them as “actual\ndamages in the form of nominal damages.” *664 We agree with MBM that no evidence supports\n$1,000 as either.\n\nThe only damages mentioned at trial related to wasted time the Woodlands spent trying to get\nMBM's cooperation. But there was no evidence about the value of that time—either the quantity\nor the cost of it. The Woodlands blamed this gap on the difficulty of tracking the lost time, but\nnever explained why it could not have been estimated. If the difficulty of proof always discharged\nthe burden of proof, many litigants would simply not bother. 5 While the Woodlands could have\nestimated the value of wasted time, it could not ask the trial court to pull a figure from thin air.\n\n [2] [3] Nevertheless, the Woodlands argues the award was justified as nominal damages. We\nagree nominal damages are available for breach of contract, as this Court has stated at least a dozen\ntimes. 6 As we wrote in 1853:\n\n\n   The law is, that if the contract is proven to be broken, the law would give some damage,\n   sufficient to authorize a verdict for the plaintiff, although, in the absence of proof of special\n loss, the damages would be nominal only. 7\nWe are hardly alone in recognizing nominal damages for breach of contract; so do the First\nand Second Restatements, 8 Williston, 9 Corbin, 10 and Black's Law Dictionary. 11 While more\ngenerous damage measures make nominal damages rare, and some judges have questioned the\nreason behind them, 12 we agree that nominal *665 damages may be recovered for breach of\ncontract.\n\n[4]     [5]    But $1,000 is not nominal damages. “[T]he usual meaning of the phrase ‘nominal\ndamages' refers to an award of one dollar.” 13 Despite substantial changes over the centuries in\nwhat a dollar will buy, it remains the standard award in federal cases, 14 and in Texas cases\nas well. 15 A few cases have awarded nominal damages of $10 and even $100, 16 but nominal\ndamages are supposed to be a “trifling sum,” 17 and $1,000 hardly falls in that category. 18\n\n [6] [7] [8] It appears from the record that the trial court awarded $1,000 as rough compensation\nfor the wasted time the Woodlands incurred. But nominal damages are not for compensation; they\nare for cases in which there are no damages, or none that could ever be proved. 19 While a few older\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                9\n\fMBM Financial Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660 (2009)\n52 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1221\n\ncases hold otherwise, 20 in recent decades the rule in Texas has been that nominal damages are not\navailable when the harm is entirely economic and subject to proof (as opposed to non-economic\nharm to civil or property rights). 21 Thus, in Gulf States Utilities *666 Co. v. Low, we rejected\nnominal damages because actual damages had been incurred, yet the plaintiff failed to prove the\namount. 22 “While mathematical precision is not required to establish the extent or amount of\none's damages, one must bring forward the best evidence of the damage of which the situation\nadmits....” 23 On this record, the $1,000 damage award to the Woodlands cannot be sustained as\neither actual or nominal damages.\n\n[9] While we normally remand for a new trial when there is some evidence to support an amount\nof actual damages, 24 in this case there was no evidence about the amount of damages at all. And\n“where the record shows as a matter of law that the plaintiff is entitled only to nominal damages, the\nappellate court will not reverse merely to enable him to recover such damages.” 25 Accordingly,\nwe must render judgment that the Woodlands take nothing as damages on its breach of contract\nclaim.\n\n\n\n                               III. Attorney's Fees: Breach of Contract\n\n[10] Chapter 38 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code allows recovery of attorney's fees in\nbreach of contract cases: “A person may recover reasonable attorney's fees ... in addition to the\namount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for ... an oral or written contract.” 26 To recover\nfees under this statute, a litigant must do two things: (1) prevail on a breach of contract claim,\nand (2) recover damages. 27 The second requirement is implied from the statute's language: for a\nfee recovery to be “in addition to the amount of a valid claim,” the claimant must recover some\namount on that claim.\n\n [11] While some damages are necessary to recover fees under this statute, 28 this Court has never\nsaid whether nominal damages are enough. But as the Woodlands can recover neither actual nor\nnominal damages, that question is not before us. Accordingly, the Woodlands' fee award cannot\nbe affirmed based on Chapter 38.\n\n\n\n                    IV. Attorney's Fees: Fraud Arising From Breach of Contract\n\n [12] Alternatively, the Woodlands argues it is entitled to attorney's fees based on fraud arising\nfrom a breach of contract, pointing to this Court's reference to such an award in Gill Savings Ass'n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                10\n\fMBM Financial Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660 (2009)\n52 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1221\n\nv. Chair *667 King. 29 But in Gill we merely reinstated bankruptcy and appellate fees; we did\nnot address the court of appeals' award of fees for both contract and fraud on the basis that they\nwere inextricably intertwined. 30 We explicitly rejected this intertwining exception in Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa and reiterated that fees are not allowed for torts like fraud. 31 Thus, even\nif the Woodlands' fraud claim arose from a breach of contract, that is no basis for an attorney's\nfee award.\n\n\n\n                           V. Attorney's Fees: Bad Faith & Vexatious Conduct\n\n[13] [14] The Woodlands also argues it is entitled to attorney's fees because MBM “has acted in\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” The rules of civil procedure allow fees\nas a sanction against a party who files pleadings in bad faith 32 or abuses the discovery process. 33\nBut the Woodlands filed no motion for sanctions pursuant to those rules. Its fee claim was not\nbased on MBM's litigation conduct but on its pre-litigation conduct; such fees are recoverable\nonly if a contract or statute so provides. As the Woodlands cannot recover fees based on contract or\nfraud, allegations that the breach was in bad faith or the fraud vexatious do not change that result.\n\n\n\n                 VI. Attorney's Fees: Declaratory Judgment & Breach of Contract\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed part of the attorney's fee award based on the Declaratory Judgments\nAct. 34 MBM asserts four reasons why declaratory relief was improper and cannot support a fee\naward. We disagree that declaratory relief was improper but agree it cannot support the fee award\nhere.\n\n[15] [16] First, MBM argues that declaratory relief is not available for contract claims (like those\nhere) that are “fully matured and predicated upon a terminated relationship.” But the Act says relief\nis available in contract cases “before or after there has been a breach,” 35 so a matured breach is\nexplicitly covered by the Act. 36 Further, declaratory relief is often available after a relationship has\nbeen terminated, as in cases concerning noncompetition covenants signed by former employees, 37\nor offsetting judgments between former litigants. 38 MBM notes that we justified declaratory relief\nin *668 BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard by referring to an “ongoing and continuing relationship,”\nbut that was solely to show that the defendant's counterclaim (relating to the parties' future rights)\nwent beyond the plaintiff's claim (relating to past damages alone). 39 We disagree that a party can\nimmunize itself against declaratory relief by simply terminating any ongoing relationship.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   11\n\fMBM Financial Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660 (2009)\n52 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1221\n\n [17] Second, MBM urges that declarations of non-liability should be barred in contract cases,\njust as they are in tort cases. As we said in Abor v. Black:\n\n             Because [the Act] appears to give the courts jurisdiction over declarations of\n             non-liability of a potential defendant in a tort action, we find that the ... District\n             Court had jurisdiction over the suit. However, we hold that the trial court should\n             have declined to exercise such jurisdiction because it deprived the real plaintiff\n             of the traditional right to choose the time and place of suit. 40\n\nBut the “real plaintiff” and the “traditional right to choose the time and place of suit” are materially\ndifferent in contract and tort cases. The “real” plaintiff in a tort action is the injured party, yet both\nparties often suffer injury if a contract collapses. When each party claims the other breached (as\nis usually the case), 41 it is hard to say who ought to be the “real” plaintiff. Here, for example,\nwhy should MBM get to choose the time and place of suit rather than the Woodlands? The Act\nitself specifically contemplates declarations that are negative (non-liability) as well as affirmative\n(liability). 42 And historically, declarations of non-liability under a contract have been among the\nmost common suits filed under the Act, including:\n\n\n   • suits by insurers to declare non-liability under a duty-to-defend clause, 43\n\n   • suits by employees to declare non-liability under a covenant not to compete, 44 and\n\n  • suits by a party to declare non-liability for higher or additional payments. 45\nExtending the bar against declarations of non-liability from tort to contract cases would drastically\nhandicap declaratory-judgment practice in Texas.\n\n*669 [18] [19] Third, MBM argues that declaratory judgments are available only if there is\nno adequate alternative cause of action. But this has never been the rule in Texas. Shortly after\nthe Legislature passed the Act in 1943, 46 this Court adopted exactly the opposite rule, stating\nthat “the existence of another adequate remedy does not bar the right to maintain an action for\ndeclaratory judgment” and finding this rule supported by “better reasoning.” 47 The federal courts\nfollow the same rule, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 makes clear: “The existence of another\nadequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.” We\nagree the Act cannot be invoked when it would interfere with some other exclusive remedy 48 or\nsome other entity's exclusive jurisdiction. 49 But prohibiting declaratory judgments whenever a\nbreach of contract claim is available would negate the Act's explicit terms covering such claims. 50\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1221\n\n [20] [21] Yet while declaratory relief may be obtained under the Act in all these circumstances,\nthat does not mean attorney's fees can too. Texas has long followed the “American Rule”\nprohibiting fee awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. 51 By contrast, the\nDeclaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to either party in all cases. 52 If repleading a claim as\na declaratory judgment could justify a fee award, attorney's fees would be available for all parties\nin all cases. That would repeal not only the American Rule but also the limits imposed on fee\nawards in other statutes. Accordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use the Act as a vehicle to\nobtain otherwise impermissible attorney's fees. 53\n\n*670 [22] The Act was originally “intended as a speedy and effective remedy” for settling\ndisputes before substantial damages were incurred. 54 It is “intended to provide a remedy that is\nsimpler and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears that a declaration might terminate the\npotential controversy.” 55 But when a claim for declaratory relief is merely tacked onto a standard\nsuit based on a matured breach of contract, allowing fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the\nlimits Chapter 38 imposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under Chapter 37 when they\nare not permitted under the specific common-law or statutory claims involved would violate the\nrule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones. 56 While the Legislature intended\nthe Act to be remedial, 57 it did not intend to supplant all other statutes and remedies. 58\n\n [23] At trial, the Woodlands recovered no damages on its breach of contract claim, so it\ncannot recover fees under Chapter 38. Allowing it to recover the same fees under Chapter 37\nwould frustrate the provisions and limitations of the neighboring chapter in the same Code. 59\nAccordingly, we hold the Woodlands cannot recover attorney's fees under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act.\n\nNevertheless, the Woodlands argues it is entitled to fees because the declaratory relief it sought\ndid more than merely duplicate the issues litigated in its contract and fraud claims. The five\ndeclarations the Woodlands obtained in the judgment were:\n\n   1. that the Woodlands “complied with its contractual obligations to provide notice of its intent\n      not to renew”;\n\n   2. that MBM “improperly failed to timely designate a carrier and location for the return”;\n\n   3. that MBM's manipulation of the termination dates barred it from making “any claim that [the\n      Woodlands] failed to provide timely notice”;\n\n   4. that the Woodlands “relied to its detriment on the termination dates provided by MBM”; and\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1221\n\n\n   5. that the Woodlands “has suffered damage as a direct result of its detrimental reliance upon\n      the termination dates provided by MBM.”\n\n *671 Whether the Woodlands sent timely notice of cancellation and MBM failed to designate\na return location were part and parcel of the Woodlands' contract claim. And whether MBM\nmisrepresented the termination dates and the Woodlands relied on those misrepresentations were\nduplicative of the Woodlands' fraud claim. Thus, the declarations sought by the Woodlands merely\nduplicated issues already before the trial court.\n\n***\n\nIt is easy to understand the Woodlands' frustration with MBM. Viewing the evidence in the proper\nlight, MBM withheld information, changed renewal dates, and manipulated the truth to try to get\nmore rent than it was entitled to. It raised dodges, defenses, and counterclaims at various stages\nthat all eventually collapsed in a heap, but only after forcing the Woodlands to incur legal fees and\ncosts. But to recover those fees, the Woodlands had to recover damages for breach of contract.\nThat it failed to do. As Chief Justice Calvert wrote for this Court almost 50 years ago:\n\n             Perhaps every successful litigant should be permitted to recover his attorney\n             fees from the opposite party. But whether that policy would be wise is for the\n             Legislature, not the courts, to decide. Apparently the Legislature has not thought\n             it wise. 60\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that the\nWoodlands take nothing.\n\n\n\nJustice O'NEILL did not participate in the decision.\n\nAll Citations\n\n292 S.W.3d 660, 52 Tex.

Our opinion of March 2, 1995, is withdrawn and the\nfollowing opinion is substituted.\n\nIn this action for damages, injunctive relief, and a declaration of coverage, the issue is whether\nso-called “absolute pollution exclusions” in insurance policies unambiguously apply to exclude\ndamage coverage from an accidental explosion producing a toxic hydrofluoric acid cloud over a\ncity. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant insurance companies.\nThe court *519 of appeals reversed the summary judgment and remanded the cause to the trial\ncourt. 860 S.W.2d 662. We agree with the trial court that the provisions unambiguously apply\nunder the circumstances presented. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and affirm\nthe trial court's judgment.\n\nCBI Industries, Inc. (“CBI”) brought this action against various insurance companies which\ninsured CBI under general liability policies. The insurers fall into three groups providing\nsuccessive “layers” of coverage: (1) National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania (“National Union”); (2) Anglo American Insurance Company, Ltd. and others\n(collectively “Anglo American”); and (3) Rome and Companies (collectively “Rome”). Each\nof the policies issued to CBI by these companies contained a version of what is known in the\nindustry as an “absolute pollution exclusion.” The National Union policy contained the following\nexclusion:\n\n            This policy does not apply to ... any Personal Injury or Property Damage\n            arising out of the actual or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape\n            of pollutants, anywhere in the world; ... “Pollutants” means any solid, liquid,\n            gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes,\n            acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste material. Waste materials include materials\n            which are intended to be or have been recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.\n\nThe Anglo American and Rome policies contained this exclusion:\n\n            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this policy, this policy is\n            amended in that it shall not apply to any claim or claims: For personal injuries\n            or property damages directly or indirectly caused by seepage or pollution or\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As contractor, CBI was\nsupervising the removal by crane of the convection section of a heater unit. An accident occurred\nwhen the crane's load was dropped onto a pipe connected to a storage tank which contained\nhydrofluoric acid, a substance identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\nas a toxic waste. 2 CBI claims that Marathon, in contravention of standard industry practices, had\nfailed to empty the storage tank prior to the commencement of the turnaround and that CBI was\nunaware of the presence of hydrofluoric acid in the tank prior to the accident.\n\nIn numerous lawsuits brought against CBI and others in connection with the accident, residents of\nTexas City and others alleged that they were injured when a large cloud of hydrofluoric acid was\nreleased as a result of the accident. CBI tendered these claims to National Union, Anglo American\nand Rome. All of the companies denied coverage and CBI filed this suit.\n\nThe insurance companies moved for summary judgment on the ground that the “absolute pollution\nexclusions” in their policies precluded coverage as a matter of law. CBI argued in response that\nthe policies, by virtue of these exclusions, contained both patent and latent ambiguities. The trial\ncourt granted summary judgment for the insurance companies before CBI had the opportunity\nto obtain any documents through the discovery process. However, the trial court did accept for\nthe record certain insurance industry documents which, CBI contends, indicate that “absolute\npollution exclusions” such as those involved in this case are ambiguous and will not be read\nliterally to exclude coverage for every situation involving the discharge of pollutants. 3\n\n *520 [1] [2] [3] [4] Insurance policies are controlled by rules of interpretation and\nconstruction which are applicable to contracts generally. See Forbau v. Aetna Life Insurance\nCompany, 876 S.W.2d 132 (Tex.1994); Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 723 S.W.2d 663, 665\n(Tex.1987). The primary concern of a court in construing a written contract is to ascertain the true\nintent of the parties as expressed in the instrument. Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 133. If a written contract\nis so worded that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning, then it is not ambiguous.\nCoker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983); see also Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Daniel,\n243 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex.1951). Parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of creating an\nambiguity. See Universal, 243 S.W.2d at 157; Lewis v.

J. 7\n\n [5] [6] If, however, the language of a policy or contract is subject to two or more reasonable\ninterpretations, it is ambiguous. See Glover v. National Insurance Underwriters, 545 S.W.2d 755,\n761 (Tex.1977); see also Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393; Universal, 243 S.W.2d at 157. Whether a\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a\nwhole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered. See Coker, 650 S.W.2d\nat 394; R & P Enterprises v. LaGuarta, Gavrel & Kirk, Inc., 596 S.W.2d 517, 518 (Tex.1980).\nOnly where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties'\ninterpretation, see Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex.1981), and admit\nextraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument. See R & P Enterprises, 596\nS.W.2d at 518.\n\n [7] [8] [9] An ambiguity in a contract may be said to be “patent” or “latent.” A patent ambiguity\nis evident on the face of the contract. See Universal Home Builders, Inc. v. Farmer, 375 S.W.2d\n737, 742 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1964, no writ). A latent ambiguity arises when a contract which\nis unambiguous on its face is applied to the subject matter with which it deals and an ambiguity\nappears by reason of some collateral matter. 4 See Murphy v. Dilworth, 137 Tex. 32, 151 S.W.2d\n1004 (1941); see also Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc. v. Alamo Sav. Ass'n, 611 S.W.2d 706, 708\n(Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1980, no writ). If a latent ambiguity arises from this application,\nparol evidence is admissible for the purpose of ascertaining the true intention of the parties as\nexpressed in the agreement. See Murphy, 151 S.W.2d at 1005.\n\nIn this case, the court of appeals did not decide that the contract was either patently or latently\nambiguous. Rather, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion when it rendered\nsummary judgment before allowing discovery. 860 S.W.2d at 666. On that basis alone, the court of\nappeals reversed and remanded to the trial court “without deciding whether there are ambiguities\nin the exclusions.” 860 S.W.2d at 664. The court reasoned that “CBI was not given sufficient time\nto make reasonable attempts to discover evidence on the issue of ‘applying the contract to the\nsubject matter with which it deals,’ and thereby raise a fact issue on latent ambiguity.” Id. at 666.\nIn support of its holding, the court summarized the industry-wide evidence in the record. Id. These\nitems of evidence, the court opined, should have indicated to the trial court that with more time for\ndiscovery, CBI “might have raised a fact issue on latent ambiguity.” Id. The discovery sought by\nCBI is of evidence that its insurers “knew and approved” of industry-wide discussions concerning\nthe breadth of the absolute pollution exclusion and “understood that the pollution exclusions *521\nwould not exclude coverage in construction accident situations.”\n\n [10] [11] [12] The court of appeals relies on the Bache decision, which held that if a latent\nambiguity is discovered when “applying the contract to the subject matter with which it deals,” then\nthe proponent of the ambiguity may introduce parol evidence to establish the parties' intent. Bache,\n611 S.W.2d at 708. The ambiguity must become evident when the contract is read in context of the\nsurrounding circumstances, not after parol evidence of intent is admitted to create an ambiguity.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 7\n\nNeither the court of appeals' opinion nor the parties' briefs have raised any need for additional facts\nto apply the insurance policies to the subject matter with which they deal. The facts relating to the\naccident, the release of hydrofluoric acid as a result of that accident, and the personal injury and\nproperty damage claims allegedly resulting from that release appear to be fully developed. The\nsurrounding circumstances present when the contract was entered into were amply established for\nthe purpose of determining whether an ambiguity exists in this case on these facts. The discovery\nsought by CBI is not necessary for the application of the contract to its subject matter, but rather\ngoes to the issue of the parties' interpretation of the “absolute pollution exclusion.” The court of\nappeals erred in holding, in effect, that CBI must be allowed an opportunity to discover parol\nevidence going to the parties' intentions in order to create a latent ambiguity. 5\n\n [13] The question to be decided here is whether these insurance policies, by virtue of their\n“absolute pollution exclusions,” are patently or latently ambiguous. On its face, the language of\nthe policies is clear and not patently ambiguous. Nor are the policies latently ambiguous. Applying\nthe policies' language to the context of the claim here does not produce an uncertain or ambiguous\nresult, but leads only to one reasonable conclusion: the loss was caused by a cloud of hydrofluoric\nacid, a substance which is clearly a “pollutant” for which coverage is precluded.\n\nCBI correctly contends that the language of the policies must be interpreted with reference to\nboth the facts of the claim and the facts within the contemplation of the parties at the signing\nof the policies. See Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 394. CBI argues that extrinsic evidence (such as trade\nusage, prior dealings, and prior negotiations) is relevant in interpreting the policies and must be\nconsidered to ascertain whether a latent ambiguity exists. Specifically, CBI argues that extrinsic\nevidence concerning industry-wide discussions of the exclusion at issue here shows that the parties\nshared a mutual, yet unstated, intent that the exclusions would not encompass “accidental” releases\nof pollutants.\n\n [14] Extrinsic evidence may, indeed, be admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning\nconsistent with that to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to “interpret” contractual\nterms. 6 If the contract language is not fairly susceptible of more than one legal meaning or\nconstruction, however, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the meaning of\nthe explicit language of the parties' written agreement. *522 Hubacek v. Ennis State Bank, 317\nS.W.2d 30, 32 (Tex.1958); Lewis, 146 S.W.2d at 980. In this case, the policies unequivocally deny\ncoverage for damage resulting from pollutants, however the damage is caused. 7 The relevant facts\nand extrinsic evidence necessary to apply this contract exclusion language to the subject matter\nwith which it deals in this case reveals no latent ambiguity.\n\nCourts usually strive for uniformity in construing insurance provisions, especially where, as here,\nthe contract provisions at issue are identical across the jurisdictions. Most courts which have\nexamined the same or substantially similar absolute pollution exclusions have concluded that they\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The language in this pollution exclusion\nis clear and susceptible of only one possible interpretation in this case. Because there are no latent\nor patent ambiguities in the policies, there are no fact issues that merit discovery. We conclude\nthat the record is sufficiently developed to support the trial court's summary judgment in favor of\nthe defendant insurance companies.

See Universal, 243 S.W.2d at 157; Lewis, 146 S.W.2d at 980; Murphy, 151\n       S.W.2d at 1005.\n          CBI also contends that one of the inferences that should be made in its favor on summary judgment is that “the policies contain\n          patent ambiguities that preclude summary judgment and cry out for discovery.” Whether the policies contain ambiguities is a\n          matter of law for the court, see Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 394; R & P Enterprises, 596 S.W.2d at 518, not an inference it must make\n          for the purpose of deciding a summary judgment motion.\n6      In cases involving “trade usage” evidence, for example, the meaning to which a certain term or phrase is most reasonably susceptible\n       is the one which so regularly observed in place, vocation, trade, or industry so “as to justify an expectation that it will be observed\n       with respect to a particular agreement.” Restatement (2d) of Contracts § 222(1). See also TEX.BUS. & COM.CODE § 1.205(b).\n7      The National Union policy applies to “any” pollution, and the Anglo American and Rome policies apply to pollution “however\n       caused.”\n8      See, e.g., Heyman Assoc.

The 286th District Court Hockley County,\nAndrew J. Kupper, J., granted summary judgment to operators on certain claims, and, after a jury\ntrial, entered judgment against current lease operators and ordered that royalty owners take nothing\nfrom former operators. Royalty owners and current lease operators appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, James T. Campbell, J., held that:\n\n[1] evidence was legally insufficient to support jury's findings of liability and damages for current\noperator's alleged failure to pay royalties according to amount-realized leases;\n\n[2] evidence was legally insufficient to support jury verdict that current and former operators failed\nto reasonably market gas produced from proceeds leases;\n\n[3] royalty owners' expert's testimony did not comport with state law as to determination of market\nvalue of casinghead gas, and thus did not support verdict that current and former lease operators\nunderpaid royalties;\n\n[4] expert's testimony as to market value of casinghead gas was unreliable, and thus provided no\nevidence to support royalty owners' claim of underpaid royalties; and\n\n[5] current lease operator did not lose title to its personal-property carbon dioxide by injecting the\ncarbon dioxide into hydrocarbon-producing formation to enhance oil recovery, and thus carbon\ndioxide was not subject to a royalty.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CAMPBELL, Justice.\n\nOwners of royalty interests 2 in lands in *396 the Slaughter Field 3 brought suit seeking damages\nfor underpaid royalties on casinghead gas 4 against the current lease operator, Occidental Permian\nLtd. (“OPL”), and two former operators of the leases. The royalty owners also asserted a claim\nagainst OPL for royalties on carbon dioxide. The trial court granted summary judgment for the\noperators on some claims, and a jury heard the remaining claims. After a verdict in favor of the\nroyalty owners, the trial court signed a judgment disregarding the jury's award of attorney's fees\nagainst OPL but otherwise awarding the damages found by the jury as to OPL. The judgment\nordered that the royalty owners take nothing from the former operators.\n\nThe royalty owners appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment, its denial of their attorney's\nfees and the take-nothing judgment against the former operators. OPL appeals the judgment against\nit.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                11\n\fOccidental Permian Ltd. v. Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\nWe will render judgment that the royalty owners take nothing from OPL. We will affirm the\nsummary judgment, the denial of attorney's fees and the take-nothing judgment as to the former\noperators. We will remand the case for entry of a new judgment consistent with this opinion and\nlaw. We will otherwise affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                 Background\n\nAs to the royalties on casinghead gas, six oil and gas leases are at issue. The parties agree that the\nroyalty on casinghead gas under four of the leases is one-eighth of the “amount realized from such\nsale” when gas is sold at the wells. The other two leases, the parties also agree, provide a royalty\non casinghead gas of three-eighths of its “market value in the field.” 5\n\nThe six leases range in date from 1934 through 1944. The Slaughter Field is an oil-producing\nfield, and the casinghead gas was flared until sometime in the 1940s when, according to testimony,\nthe Railroad Commission prohibited the practice. In the late 1940s, eight lessees, including the\ndefendants' predecessor Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, jointly constructed the Slaughter Gas\nProcessing Plant. The plant began operation in 1949.\n\nThe lessees individually entered into Casinghead Gas Contracts, beginning in *397 1947, by\nwhich they sold the casinghead gas produced on their leases to the plant owners. The gas contracts\nwere “percentage of proceeds” contracts, by which the plant agreed to pay the lessees 50% of the\nproceeds from the sale of processed residue gas and 33.3% of the proceeds from the sale of natural\ngas liquids (NGLs) from the plant. 6 The term of these gas sales contracts was for the life of the\nSlaughter Plant. 7\n\nIn the 1960s, units were formed for the purpose of conducting secondary recovery operations,\nsuch as waterfloods, to enhance production of oil in the field. Then in the 1980s tertiary recovery\noperations were commenced, by which carbon dioxide is injected into the producing formation,\nalso for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing production of oil. The injected CO2 becomes\ncommingled with hydrocarbons in the producing formation and comes back to the surface along\nwith the casinghead gas.\n\nHigh levels of CO2 interfere with the processing of gas in the Slaughter Plant. 8 As the CO2-\ninjection program expanded in the field, levels of CO2 in the casinghead gas increased. And the\ninjected CO2 migrated to nearby units, so casinghead gas produced from wells outside the units\nin which CO2 was being injected also experienced increased CO2 levels. During the mid–1980s,\nthe owners of the Slaughter Plant constructed the adjoining Mallet Plant to process gas with high\nCO2 concentrations. The CO2 extracted from the gas at the Mallet Plant is returned to the unit\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\noperator for reinjection into the oil-producing formation. The CO2 thus follows a continuous cycle\nof injection, recovery, processing and re-injection. The casinghead gas, shorn of CO2, is piped\nfrom the Mallet Plant to the Slaughter Plant for further processing.\n\nIn 1996, BP America Production Company, then known as Amoco Production Company, became\noperator of the Slaughter and Mallet Plants and operator of the leases at issue in the litigation.\nIt later was succeeded as operator of the plant and leases by Altura Energy Ltd. In 2000, OPL\nacquired both the leases and the plants. Thus, OPL now is both seller and buyer of the casinghead\ngas under the gas sales contracts.\n\nUnder the terms of the casinghead gas sales contracts, the casinghead gas is delivered to the\nbuyer at or near the wellhead. Evidence showed that after the gas is gathered from the leases,\nand processed through the Mallet and Slaughter plants, the NGLs extracted from the gas stream,\nand the residue gas available for sale after processing, are transferred to OPL's affiliated company\nOccidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (“OEMI”). OEMI markets the extracted NGLs at Mont\nBelvieu, Texas, near the Houston Ship Channel, and the residue gas at Waha, an El Paso Natural\nGas Co. marketing hub in Pecos County.\n\nIn their suit against BP America Production Company, Altura Energy Ltd. (who we will refer to\njointly as BP) and OPL, the royalty owners contended (1) BP and OPL breached the four amount-\nrealized leases by failing to pay royalty calculated on the actual amount they realized *398 from\nsale of casinghead gas; (2) BP and OPL breached an implied covenant in the amount-realized\nleases by failing to market the casinghead gas as would a reasonably prudent operator; (3) under\nthe two market-value leases, BP and OPL did not calculate casinghead gas royalties on its market\nvalue in the field; and (4) OPL failed to pay a royalty on the CO2 separated from the gas at the\nMallet Plant. The royalty owners moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that\nOPL owed a royalty on CO2. By cross-motion, OPL sought a declaration that the CO2 was not\nsubject to its royalty obligation. The trial court agreed with OPL and granted a partial summary\njudgment accordingly. The remaining issues were tried to the jury.\n\nThe jury found for the royalty owners on all liability theories submitted and awarded them\nattorney's fees. The trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of BP on its\nstatute of limitations defense 9 and in favor of OPL on the award of attorney's fees. The court then\nrendered judgment that the royalty owners recover $7,064,674 from OPL and take nothing from\nBP. As noted, both OPL and the royalty owners appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                   Analysis\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\n\nIssues Tried to Jury\nThrough three issues OPL contends no evidence supported the jury's findings of liability and\ndamages for: (1) the failure to pay royalties according to the amount-realized leases; (2) the breach\nof the implied duty to market in the amount-realized leases; and (3) the underpayment of royalties\non the market-value leases. BP raises the same arguments in response to the royalty owners' cross-\nappeal. 10 By cross-appeal, the royalty owners argue the trial court erred in granting judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict on BP's statute of limitations defense and in favor of BP and OPL on\nthe royalty owners' request for attorney's fees.\n\nWhen conducting a legal sufficiency review, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to\nthe judgment and indulge every reasonable inference to support it, crediting favorable evidence if\na reasonable factfinder could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless a reasonable factfinder\ncould not.

Cazarez,\n937 S.W.2d 444, 450 (Tex.1996). When evidence is so weak as to do no more than create “a mere\nsurmise or suspicion” that a fact exists, the evidence does not exceed a scintilla.

Con/Chem, Inc., 650 S.W.2d\n61, 63 (Tex.1983)).\n\n\nThe Amount–Realized Leases\n [1] As noted, the royalty clause of the four amount-realized, or proceeds, leases *399 specifies\na royalty on casinghead gas sold at the wells of one-eighth of the amount realized from the sale.\nOPL contends the evidence conclusively shows it paid royalties in accordance with the royalty\nclause, and we agree.\n\n [2] An oil and gas lease is a contract and interpreted accordingly. Tana Oil & Gas Corp. v.\nCernosek, 188 S.W.3d 354, 359 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006, pet. denied). It is a basic tenet of our\nlaw that competent parties enjoy the utmost freedom of contract and courts will enforce a contract\nfreely and voluntarily made for a lawful purpose. Crutchfield v.

Id.\n\nIt is further undisputed that, at all times pertinent to this litigation, the life-of-the-plant gas sales\ncontracts for the sale of the casinghead gas at the wellhead have remained in place, and that the\nlessees have paid royalties to the lessors based on the proceeds received by the lessees for the\ncasinghead gas in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Nevertheless, the royalty owners\ncontend, and the jury found, that the lessees failed to pay royalties in accordance with the leases.\n\nThe royalty owners' expert Charles Graham testified to his opinion that the amount OPL truly\nrealizes for the casinghead gas is not the proceeds it receives under the wellhead gas sales\ncontracts. 11 His opinion focused on the circumstance that OPL, through its acquisition of sole\nownership of both the leases and the Slaughter Plant, is both seller and buyer of the casinghead\ngas. It follows, according to Graham, that the determination of the amount realized by OPL is\nno longer limited to that received under the gas sales contracts. His opinion was that the amount\nOPL realizes for the gas at the wellhead, properly calculated, equals 100% of the proceeds of the\ndownstream sales of the extracted NGLs and residue gas less certain costs. 12 One eighth of that\namount, Graham testified, is the royalty owed by OPL.\n\nWe find Graham's testimony provided no evidence OPL failed to pay royalties as required by the\nleases. First, his theory simply does not comport with the plain language of the leases. Under the\nfour “amount-realized” leases, royalty is calculated on the amount realized from sale only if the\ngas is sold at the well; otherwise, royalty is payable on the market value of the gas. The gas royalty\nlanguage from the 1934 Christine DeVitt “B” *400 lease is typical of the four amount-realized\nleases, stating that the royalty is “on gas produced from said land and sold or used off the land\nor in the manufacture of gasoline, including casinghead gas, the market price at the well of one-\neighth of the gas so sold or used, provided that if and when lessee shall sell gas at the wells lessor's\nroyalty thereon shall be one-eighth of the amount realized from such sales.” There is no dispute\nthat the “such sales” referred to are the sales of gas at the wells. Graham's theory necessarily makes\nuse of the gas sales contracts to establish that the casinghead gas is sold at the wellhead (thus\ntriggering the obligation to pay royalty on the amount realized from “such sales”), then ignores the\nprovisions of the contracts 13 when determining the amount realized from the sale. 14 The royalty\nowners cannot have it both ways. If the gas sales contracts are effective to establish that the lessee\nis selling the gas at the wells, so as to trigger the obligation to pay royalty on the amount realized\nfrom “such sales,” the terms of the same contracts cannot be disregarded in the determination of\nthe amount realized from “such sales.”\n\nMoreover, the proceeds to which Graham pointed as the basis for his theory were not proceeds\nof the sale of gas as produced at the wellhead, but those of the sale of natural gas liquids and\nresidue gas after processing. Graham testified that the amount OPL realized from the wellhead sale\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Graham's version of the amount realized thus\nincludes amounts OPL realized from its activities beyond the wellhead, including its gathering\nof the gas, its processing of the gas at the Mallet and Slaughter Plants and its marketing of the\nextracted liquids. Cf. Tana Oil & Gas Corp., 188 S.W.3d at 360–61 (phrase “at the well” means\nbefore value is added by preparing the gas for market). Evidence of proceeds received by OEMI,\nan affiliated but different company, from sales of NGLs and residue gas at locations far removed\nfrom the wellhead is not evidence of the amount realized by OPL from a sale of raw gas at the\nwell. 15\n\nWe agree with OPL the undisputed evidence that royalties have been paid in accordance with the\nproceeds received under the casinghead gas sales contracts is conclusive evidence that royalties\nhave been paid as required by the leases. See Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 814–15 (discussing conclusive\nevidence).\n\n\nThe Implied Duty to Market Gas\n [5] BP and OPL next challenge the legal sufficiency of evidence supporting the *401 jury's\nfindings of liability and damages for failure to reasonably market gas produced under the amount-\nrealized leases.\n\n [6] [7] If silent on the subject, an oil and gas lease includes an implied covenant by the lessee\nto manage and administer the lease. Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 373. This implied covenant places\non the lessee the duty to market the oil and gas reasonably. Id.; Amoco Prod. Co. v. Alexander,\n622 S.W.2d 563, 568 (Tex.1981) (conduct of lessee is measured by that of reasonably prudent\noperator under same or similar circumstances). The focus in an action for breach of the duty to\nreasonably market is on the conduct of the lessee and not other sales. Union Pac. Res. Group, Inc.\nv. Hankins, 111 S.W.3d 69, 71 (Tex.2003).\n\nWe begin our discussion by noting our disagreement with one position taken by OPL. It argues\nthat the Texas Supreme Court has limited breaches of the implied covenant to market to instances\nin which the proceeds received by the lessee were the result of fraud or sham. OPL relies on\nlanguage in Hankins, 111 S.W.3d at 74, for this proposition. We do not agree that Hankins so\nheld. As the court pointed out in Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 700, the issue with which the court dealt\nin Hankins was whether there was a common legal question within a class consisting of lessors\nof market-value and proceeds leases. The court began its analysis of that issue in Hankins by\nlisting the common issues the trial court had identified. 111 S.W.3d at 73. Searching the list for\nat least one issue of law or fact that both inhered in the complaints of all proposed class members\nand was subject to generalized proof, the court divided the trial court's list into a group of issues\nit found questioned whether the defendants breached the implied covenant by failing to obtain\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. at 74. Reiterating the holding of Yzaguirre\nthat no covenant to reasonably market is implied in market-value royalty leases, and finding that\nmarket-value royalty owners are protected from the effects of inter-affiliate transactions by their\nentitlement to receive royalty based on the “objective market value,” the court went on to hold that\nnone of the trial court's listed issues had application to market-value leases, depriving the proposed\nclass of commonality. Id. at 74–75. The statement to which OPL points, “the question under a\nproceeds lease would be whether the proceeds actually received by the lessee were a fraud or a\nsham,” id. at 74, must be seen in its context of the court's discussion of the issues identified by the\ntrial court in that case. We do not believe the Supreme Court intended by the statement to limit the\nduty to reasonably market, when implied, to a duty in all cases simply to avoid fraudulent or sham\nmarketing transactions. Nor do we see anything in the court's opinion in Bowden, which OPL also\ncites, to suggest such a limitation applicable in all cases. 247 S.W.3d at 700 (noting that “Hankins\ndid involve similar allegations that the lessee's intra-affiliate sales transactions were a sham”).\n\n [8] We agree, though, with OPL that in an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence it breached\nits duty to reasonably market the casinghead gas, our inquiry must focus on its behavior, not on\nevidence of other sales. Hankins, 111 S.W.3d at 71. And we agree that the evidence of its breach\nof the duty is legally insufficient.\n\nThe charge asked whether BP and OPL failed to reasonably market gas produced from the proceeds\nleases. In conjunction with the question, the trial court instructed the jury that BP and OPL\nhad “a duty to act as a reasonably prudent operator *402 would act under the same or similar\ncircumstances.”\n\nThe royalty owners argue the evidence showed that selling the casinghead gas for such “meager\nproceeds,” that is, a third of the liquids and half the residue gas, “breaches the duty to market\nbecause [a reasonably prudent operator] would not sell gas to a plant on such low proceeds—\nparticularly when the [reasonably prudent operator] owns and controls the plant.” But, as noted,\nit is undisputed that OPL has paid royalties according to the proceeds under the percentage gas\nsales contracts put in place by its predecessors. Moreover, no witness opined that the percentage\nsales contracts were unreasonable when signed. Graham testified that the lessees' entry into\nthe percentage sales contracts when the Slaughter Plant was built was reasonably prudent. It is\nundisputed also that the terms of those contracts extended for the life of the plant. The allegedly\nbreaching behavior of OPL, then, does not consist of any action on its part but merely its failure\nto change the terms of contracts that came with the properties it purchased.\n\nThe royalty owners emphasize the self-dealing nature of the gas sales contracts, referring to\nthe contracts as OPL's “left hand” selling the gas to its “right hand.” As a pattern for their\nimplied covenant analysis, the royalty owners point to Harding v. Cameron, 220 F.Supp. 466\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  17\n\fOccidental Permian Ltd. v.

The royalty owners\ncorrectly note that Harding involved a lessee who occupied both the selling and buying sides of\nan arrangement for the compression of natural gas. On a complaint by his lessors of underpaid\nroyalties, the court held the lessee had breached duties to exercise the diligence of a prudent\noperator and to obtain a market for the gas at the best price obtainable. Id. at 470. Citing his self-\ndealing, the court found that the lessee had acted primarily in his own interest and without regard\nto his obligations to the lessors. Id.\n\nWe do not find Harding persuasive authority on the issues involved here. First, under Oklahoma\nlaw, royalty was payable on the “value” or “market price” of the gas, and Texas does not recognize\nan implied duty to market under a lease with a market-value royalty provision. Hankins, 111\nS.W.3d at 72; Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374. 16 Second, the actions of the lessee in Harding\ninvolved setting up the offending gas marketing arrangements, not simply acquiring both sides of\narrangements that were prudent when established. 17\n\nCertainly Texas implied covenant law takes self-dealing into account. The Texas Supreme Court\nhas noted that the implied covenant to reasonably market oil and gas serves to protect a lessor\nfrom the lessee's *403 self-dealing or negligence. Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374. But the royalty\nowners here seem to assume that a showing of self-dealing is all that is required to show a breach\nof the implied covenant. In fact, their evidence of OPL's breach of the duty to reasonably market\nthe casinghead gas is dependent on its self-dealing. Under the royalty owners' theory, OPL has\nbreached its duty to reasonably market by failing to modify the terms of the gas sales contracts\nprecisely because it, acting alone, has the ability to do so. The royalty owners presented no\nevidence that a reasonably prudent seller of casinghead gas in OPL's position would have any\nability to terminate or modify the life-of-the-plant gas sales contracts if it were not also the plant\nowner, nor did they present any evidence that the terms of a re-negotiated or modified gas sales\ncontract for gas in the Slaughter Field, negotiated at arms-length, would be better for the seller\nthan those of the existing contracts. 18 While the royalty owners produced substantial blocks of\nexpert testimony and documentary exhibits supporting their claims, we agree with OPL there\nwas no proof of what different marketing action was required of a reasonably prudent operator\nunder the same or similar circumstances. See Migl v. Dominion Oklahoma Texas Expl. & Prod.,\nInc., No. 13-05-0589-CV, 2007 WL 475318, at *6, *6–7, 2007 Tex.App. Lexis 1179, at *18–*19\n(Tex.App.-Corpus Christi Feb. 15, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.) (considering evidence of breach of\nimplied covenant to reasonably market).\n\n\nUnderpayment of Royalties on Market–Value Leases\nBy their third cause of action, the royalty owners claimed BP and OPL failed to pay royalties\nbased on the market value of gas in the field under the market-value leases. As noted, the royalty\nclauses of these leases provide a three-eighths royalty of the market value in the field of gas sold.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BP and OPL objected in the trial court and argue here that Alguire's testimony\nwas irrelevant and unreliable, and therefore provided no evidence. Of the positions they advance\nsupporting their argument, 19 we address two: that Alguire's definition of market value does not\ncomport with Texas law, and that the gas sold under the contracts on which she formed her market\nvalue opinion was not comparable in quality to the gas produced on the OPL leases at issue in\nthis litigation.\n\n [10] [11] [12] The market value of property is the price it would bring when offered for sale\nby one desiring, but not obligated, to sell and bought by one under no necessity of buying it.\nYzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374 (citing Middleton, 613 S.W.2d at 246). Texas law recognizes two\nmethods to determine market value of gas sold at the well. Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank, 939\nS.W.2d 118, 122 (Tex.1996). The preferred *404 method, and that used by the royalty owners'\nexpert Alguire, is that of examining comparable sales. See id. at 122; Texas Oil & Gas Corp. v.\nVela, 429 S.W.2d 866, 872 (Tex.1968). To determine its market value, gas is valued as though it\nis free and available for sale. Middleton, 613 S.W.2d at 246.\n\n [13] [14] [15] “Market value is generally determined by comparing the sale price to other\nsales ‘comparable in time, quality, quantity, and availability of marketing outlets.’ ” Hankins, 111\nS.W.3d at 71 (quoting Heritage Res., 939 S.W.2d at 122). A sale of gas of comparable quality\ninvolves gas with similar physical properties such as sweet, sour, or casinghead gas. Middleton,\n613 S.W.2d at 246. Proper expert testimony may make adjustments between sales of gas with\ndiffering physical properties so that the sales being compared truly are comparable. See id. at 247\n(referring to adjustments for gas of differing BTU content).\n\nOne presenting expert testimony must be properly qualified and her opinions must be relevant and\nbased on a reliable foundation.

(quoting Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726). “If the expert's testimony is not\nreliable, it is not evidence.” Kerr–McGee, 133 S.W.3d at 254 (citing Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 713).\n\nUnlike the market-value studies reflected in other reported Texas cases, the market-value study\nto which Alguire testified was not conducted by comparing the dollars-per-Mcf or dollars-per-\nMMBTU values of the prices on which the royalty owners received royalty with royalties paid for\ncomparable gas. See, e.g., Middleton, 613 S.W.2d at 247–48; Amoco Prod. Co. v. First Baptist\nChurch, 579 S.W.2d 280, 282 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1979), writ ref'd n.r.e., 611 S.W.2d 610 (1980)\n(per curiam). Like their claims under the amount-realized leases, the royalty owners' case under the\nmarket-value leases complained of the percentages of the post-processing sales prices allocated to\nthe wellhead sale, not the product sales prices themselves. Their contention is not that OPL paid\nroyalties based on below-market prices for casinghead gas but that the allocation of only 33.3% of\nthe NGL revenue and 50% of the residue gas revenue to the wellhead *405 under the percentage\nof proceeds contracts resulted in royalties being paid on something less than the market value of\nthe casinghead gas at the wellhead. Accordingly, Alguire testified she compared the 33.3% of\nNGLs, 50% of residue gas percentage of proceeds terms in place here with percentages of proceeds\nbeing paid under other contracts for casinghead gas gathered to a gas processing plant. As Alguire\ndescribed it, her assignment from the royalty owners was “to provide, annually, percentage of\nproceeds that were representative of market value for the casinghead gas in the area.”\n\nThe results of Alguire's study were described in the royalty owners' exhibit 296, which consisted of\ncharts on which were plotted the percentages of the downstream resale prices for NGLs and residue\ngas received by the sellers under various contracts Alguire had reviewed. By plotting the contracts\naccording to their date of signing, Alguire calculated a “market value” for percentages of proceeds\nfor each year during the period 1990 through 2007. As an example, the chart for 1990 shows six\ncontracts signed during that year for the sale of casinghead gas to a processing plant operator on\na percentage of proceeds basis. Under one contract, the seller received for its casinghead gas 50%\nof the proceeds of the downstream sale of NGLs and 75% of the proceeds of the sale of residue\ngas. Other percentages reflected on the 1990 chart ranged from 35% to 75% of NGL proceeds.\nBased on those results, Alguire determined that the “market value” for such proceeds in 1990 was\n60% of NGL proceeds. By her determinations, the “market value” proceeds ranged from 60% in\nthe earlier years of her study to 80% in the years 2001 through 2007. Her conclusion was that “the\n33 percent basis for the percentage of proceeds [under the OPL contracts] was below the range\nobserved for comparable casinghead gas sales in the area.”\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\n\n\nAs OPL points out, Alguire's study never resolves itself to a market value for the casinghead gas\nstated in dollars and cents. The study's premise is that there is a “market value” for percentages of\nproceeds. We agree with OPL that Alguire's study and testimony provide no evidence OPL failed\nto pay royalties based on the market value of the gas in the field.\n\nThe royalty owners argue that the downstream prices OPL receives for its processed residue gas\nand extracted NGLs were not at issue in the litigation and their amounts and sufficiency were not in\ndispute. The royalty owners insist that the only dispute with regard to the market-value leases was\nwhether the 33.3% NGLs, 50% residue gas proceeds allocated to the wellhead by OPL constitute\nmarket value in the field. We recognize it is common for casinghead gas to be sold on percentage\nof proceeds terms, 20 and recognize the changes in recent decades in the marketing of natural gas\nand NGLs. Nonetheless, it seems to us that comparing percentages begs the question “percentage\nof what?” Without evidence of the downstream prices for which other gas plant operators sold\ntheir NGLs and residue gas, it seems to us impossible to reach a true market value conclusion.\nEvidence that a seller of gas received 50% of NGL proceeds is meaningless without knowledge\nof the amount of the proceeds.\n\n [21] OPL also contends Alguire's testimony was unreliable, and thus provided no evidence,\nbecause the casinghead gas sold under other contracts she compared was not comparable in quality\nto that produced from the two Slaughter Field market-value *406 leases. We agree with this\ncontention as well.\n\nOne of the two market-value leases is a part of the Slaughter Estate Unit, the other a part of the\nNorthwest Mallet Unit. For the period the royalty owners claimed damages, the Slaughter Estate\nUnit was under CO2 injection. A 2001 revenue audit report prepared by Alguire described the\nnatural gas production as “extremely contaminated, mostly by carbon dioxide.” The report stated\ncarbon dioxide levels exceeded 80% of metered production on the Slaughter Estate Unit and “\n‘roughly 40%’ ” on the Northwest Mallet Unit. Alguire's trial testimony was consistent with her\n2001 report. She said gas produced from the Slaughter Estate Unit during the period contained\nCO2 levels in the 80–90% range. The Northwest Mallet Unit was not under CO2 injection until\nthe conclusion of Alguire's survey period. But carbon dioxide in the gas produced from this unit\nincreased from the 20–30% range in the mid–1990s to the 60–70% range by 2007. Before injection\nbegan on the Northwest Mallet Unit, CO2 migrated there from surrounding properties.\n\nAlguire acknowledged that the comparable sales approach for obtaining market value requires\nconsideration of the quality of the gas. But Alguire conducted her market value study on the\npremise that high levels of injected CO2 should not be included as a comparability factor in the\nmarket value analysis. She explained the rationale for her methodology:\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                21\n\fOccidental Permian Ltd. v. Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\n\n            I was hesitant about including injected CO2 in the comparability standards\n            because it would be effectively charging the cost of the CO2 operations, either\n            directly with the CO2 removal fees, which haven't been charged, or indirectly\n            by saying this gas isn't worth anything because it has got all of this CO2 in it\n            that we put there, even though, in this instance, in the Northwest Mallet Unit, it\n            wasn't even put there by the operators. It seeped in from surrounding areas.\n\n\nAlguire's intentional 21 omission of the high CO2 content of the gas from her comparability\nevaluation 22 improperly injects an entirely subjective factor into the search for what Texas law\ndescribes as an objective calculation. See Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 709 (“[m]arket value leases\nprovide an objective basis for calculating royalties....”); Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374; Hankins, 111\nS.W.3d at 72 (both also referring to “objective basis for calculating royalties” provided by market-\nvalue royalty provisions). It represents, moreover, the kind of outcome-directed methodology\ncondemned in Robinson. 923 S.W.2d at 559.\n\n [22] Alguire presented lengthy and detailed testimony. But by not considering contracts for sale\nof gas with high CO2 content in her evaluation of the market value of the Slaughter Estate and\nNorthwest Mallet unit gas highly contaminated with CO2, Alguire omitted a material step in the\nquality analysis required by the *407 comparable sales approach. Without a true comparison of\nhydrocarbon quality, too great an analytical gap stands between the data, assuming its accuracy,\nand Alguire's market value opinion. See General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118\nS.Ct. 512, 519, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (opinion evidence connected to existing data by nothing\nbut credentialed expert's ipse dixit is insufficient). Lacking reliability, the opinion is incompetent\nand amounts to no evidence that BP and OPL underpaid royalties on the market-value leases. In the\nabsence of any additional evidence supporting the jury's implicit finding of comparable quality,\nwe conclude its market-value finding is not supported by any evidence.\n\n\nDamages\n [23] Finding the jury's affirmative responses to the three questions inquiring of the liability of\nBP and OPL were supported by legally insufficient evidence, we turn to the jury's corresponding\ndamage findings. “It is well established in Texas that no recovery is allowed unless liability has\nbeen established.” Mitchell v. Bank of Am., N.A., 156 S.W.3d 622, 627 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2004,\npet. denied). In the absence of liability findings, damage findings are immaterial. Fire Ins. Exch.\nv. Sullivan, 192 S.W.3d 99, 107 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). We therefore\nsustain OPL's first issue concerning the proceeds leases, its sub-issue concerning the implied duty\nto market, and its second issue concerning the market-value leases.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They argue the\ndiscovery rule tolls the applicable limitation period until each royalty owner knew or reasonably\nshould have known facts giving rise to a cause of action. Because no evidence supports the three\naffirmative theories of relief the royalty owners asserted against BP, determining whether their\nclaims were subject to a limitations defense or they could legally assert the discovery doctrine in\navoidance of limitations are questions whose resolution is unnecessary to our disposition of this\nappeal. We, therefore, do not address the issue.

MRD Invs.,\nInc., 47 S.W.3d 721, 724 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).\n\nAccording to the summary judgment record, the CO2 OPL injects into the hydrocarbon-producing\nformation to enhance oil recovery is transported to the Slaughter Field from New Mexico and\nColorado. 23 The CO2 is extracted from the produced gas stream at the processing plants, returned\nto the leases, and reinjected as part of the recovery operation. While the royalty owners agree\nthat the transported CO2 is OPL's personal property before its injection, they theorize that the\nextraneous CO2 loses its personal property character on injection, is susceptible to capture in the\nproducing formation, and OPL is authorized to capture, or recapture, the CO2 through the grant\nof the leases and provisions of the unit agreements. As captured, they contend, the CO2 is subject\nto OPL's royalty obligation. 24\n\n [26] The royalty owners' claims to a royalty on the injected CO2 depend entirely on the correctness\nof their contention that OPL loses title to its personal-property CO2 when it introduces the\nsubstance into the subsurface producing formation. Although the unit agreements, to which the\nroyalty owners are parties, contain express authorization for the unit operator *409 to inject\nsubstances into the unitized formation, 25 and the unit agreements contain provisions concerning\nroyalty payments, we do not understand the royalty owners to contend that the unit agreements\ncontain a commitment by OPL to pay royalty beyond its royalty obligation under the leases.\nBefore the trial court, the royalty owners asserted that the provisions of the unit agreements\naffecting royalties did not supersede the leases' royalty clauses, but simply constituted an “overlay”\naddressing the manner in which royalty would be paid under unit operations. 26 Thus we consider\nit undisputed that the unit agreements do not require payment of a royalty not already required\nunder the leases. Similarly, the royalty owners make no contention here that the terms of any of\nthe leases entitle them to royalty on the injected CO2 whether or not it became subject to the rule of\ncapture on its injection. Our inquiry, then, is whether, under Texas law, the rule of capture operates\nto subject extraneous CO2 injected and recovered by OPL to a royalty obligation under its leases.\n\n\n  The “rule of capture” is a well established doctrine in Texas which holds that a landowner is\n  entitled to produce the oil and gas in place beneath his land, as well as the oil and gas which flows\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognizing that oil and gas are fugitive minerals that will migrate throughout\n   a reservoir without regard to property lines, the rule of capture provides that a landowner owns\n   all the oil and gas produced by a legally drilled well located on his land, even though the well\n   may be draining minerals from nearby properties.\n   SWEPI, L.P. v. Camden Resources, Inc., 139 S.W.3d 332, 341 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2004,\n   pet. denied) (citations omitted).\nWhile no Texas case directly addresses title and ownership of extraneous CO2 injected into a\nformation for production enhancement, the ownership of extraneous natural gas injected into a\nstorage formation was at issue in Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. West. 508 S.W.2d 812 (Tex.1974).\nOPL urges that our analysis of the claims to royalty on the injected CO2 here should begin and\nend with Humble Oil, and a case on which it relied, Lone Star Gas Co. v. Murchison. 353 S.W.2d\n870 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1962, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nIn Humble Oil, deeds by the Wests to Humble in part recited “that the Wests ‘except from this\nconveyance and retain unto themselves .... those certain royalties on oil, gas and other minerals\nwhich may be produced and saved from the lands hereby conveyed.’ ” Concerning gas, the\nconveyances described the retained royalty as “ ‘a royalty equal to the market value at the well of\none-sixth (1/6) of the dry gas so sold or used; provided that on such dry gas sold at the wells the\nroyalties shall be one-sixth (1/6) of the amount realized from such sale.’ ” Id. at 813.\n\nAs the field reservoir approached depletion, Humble obtained Railroad Commission authorization\nto use the reservoir for gas storage. Id. The Wests sued Humble *410 for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief. The trial court ordered Humble to account to the Wests for their royalty interests\nin all gas produced irrespective of whether the gas was extraneous or native. Id. at 814. The court\nof civil appeals reversed with instructions for entry of a permanent injunction restraining Humble\nfrom injecting and storing gas in the reservoir until all native gas was produced. Id.\n\nBefore the supreme court, the Wests argued because of their royalty on all oil, gas and minerals\nproduced and saved from the properties, Humble owed a royalty on all gas produced and saved,\nwhether native or extraneous. Id. at 817. According to the Wests, a contrary holding would rewrite\nthe conveyance documents. Id.\n\nIn its analysis, the court looked to Murchison, 353 S.W.2d 870. There, Murchison argued Lone\nStar lost title to extraneous gas it injected into a storage reservoir as the gas became like a wild\nanimal, subject to capture. Rejecting the notion that the gas returned to its natural and wild state\nand was thus subject to the law of capture, the court in Murchison found the correct rule was “once\n[severed] from the realty, gas and oil, like other minerals, become personal property ... title to\nnatural gas once having been reduced to possession is not lost by the injection of such gas into a\nnatural reservoir for storage purposes.” Humble Oil, 508 S.W.2d at 817 (quoting Murchison, 353\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 25\n\fOccidental Permian Ltd. v. Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\nS.W.2d at 878 quoting White v. New York State Natural Gas Corp., et al., 190 F.Supp. 342, 347,\n349 (W.D.Pa.1960)) (additional quotation marks omitted). 27 Relying on Murchison, the Court\nin Humble Oil concluded the extraneous gas Humble injected into the storage reservoir was and\nremained the personal property of Humble.\n\nThe Wests argued that the obligation of Humble in the conveyance document to pay a royalty\non all gas produced and saved distinguished Murchison. 508 S.W.2d at 817. Disagreeing, the\nsupreme court found to adopt such reasoning would implicitly recognize the doctrine of minerals\nferae naturae that Murchison rejected. Id. Thus the court held, “Humble's ownership of the gas\nas personal property is not altered either upon injection of the gas in the reservoir or upon later\nproduction of the gas. The language of the conveyance does no more than reserve the royalty\ninterest in the native gas in the reservoir, and Humble's ownership of the extraneous gas is\nunaffected thereby.” Id.\n\nThe analogy between stored natural gas and the injected CO2 described in this record is not exact,\nbut we find Humble Oil and Murchison sufficiently analogous to guide our decision. 28 This record\ndoes not describe differences in the injection of extraneous CO2 to enhance oil production and\nthe injection of natural gas for storage to require application of a different rule to the dispute\nbefore us. 29 Both involve injection of a gaseous substance into a well- *411 defined underground\nformation with Railroad Commission approval. 30 Nothing suggests OPL has an intent to abandon\nthe CO2 it injects and recovers. See Murchison, 353 S.W.2d at 870 (also finding no intent to\nabandon). Indeed, OPL's recycling and reinjection of the CO2 removed at the Mallet Plant belies\nany intent to abandon the injected and recovered CO2.\n\nThe royalty owners' heavy reliance on Corzelius v. Harrell, 143 Tex. 509, 186 S.W.2d 961 (1945)\nis misplaced. Corzelius concerns Railroad Commission orders regulating production of natural\ngas from a field in which a gas recycling operation was being conducted. 186 S.W.2d at 970. It\nwas cited to the court in Murchison, which found it dealt with “the law of original capture,” and\nnot applicable to stored extraneous gas. 353 S.W.2d at 870.\n\nCorzelius is not mentioned by the court in Humble Oil. Corzelius is more often cited in cases\nconcerning assertions of subsurface trespass. See, e.g., Coastal Oil & Gas v. Garza Energy Trust,\n268 S.W.3d 1, 13 n. 37 (Tex.2008); Railroad Commission of Texas v. Manziel, 361 S.W.2d 560,\n568 (Tex.1962). Like the court in Murchison, 353 S.W.2d at 870, we find it inapplicable to the\nquestion before us.\n\nFor these reasons, we find the trial court did not err in granting OPL's motion for partial summary\njudgment and denying that of the royalty owners.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\n9     The royalty owners filed suit in January 2006, seeking damages for the alleged wrongful conduct of BP from 1990 to 2000. They\n      asserted the discovery doctrine in avoidance of the limitations defenses interposed by BP. OPL acquired the leases and plants in\n      August 2000 but the royalty owners limited their claims against OPL to the period January 2002 through August 2008.\n10    On liability and damage questions like those submitted against OPL, the jury made affirmative findings against BP. While the jury\n      made findings supporting application of the discovery doctrine, as noted, the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict\n      in favor of BP on limitations grounds. On appeal, BP argues the trial court correctly disregarded the findings supporting the discovery\n      doctrine's application. BP further contends that even were this error, no evidence supported the liability and damage findings made\n      against BP.\n11    Graham testified that to establish the amount OPL realized from its sale of the casinghead gas, he looked not to the gas sales contracts\n      but “what the defendants really realized” less “some costs.”\n12    See Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 702 (describing, in class action certification appeal, similar distinction between wellhead prices and those\n      received from downstream sales after processing).\n13    Graham straightforwardly acknowledged that his analysis ignored the percentages stated in the gas sales contracts, opining that the\n      contracts' percentage of proceeds formula was “not binding on” the lessors.\n14    The royalty owners' contention here is thus distinguished from that described in Texas Oil & Gas Corp. v. Hagen, 683 S.W.2d 24\n      (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1984), writ dism'd as moot, 760 S.W.2d 960 (Tex.1988), in which the court of appeals affirmed trial court\n      findings that a purported wellhead sale of gas by the producer to its wholly-owned pipeline subsidiary was a sham, and that the “true\n      sale” of the gas was off the lease premises, making a market-value royalty provision applicable. Id. at 28.\n15    Note, for example, the issues recited in proposed class litigation brought by royalty owners against affiliated defendants as including\n      the issue whether the “corporate separateness” of affiliated defendants should be disregarded. Union Pac. Res. Group, Inc. v. Hankins,\n      111 S.W.3d 69, 73 (Tex.2003). Graham's opinion testimony simply assumed that receipt of proceeds by OPL's affiliate OEMI is to\n      be equated with their receipt by OPL. The royalty owners do not support such an assumption by citation to Texas authority.\n16    As to the substantial differences in the approaches taken by Texas and Oklahoma courts to the lessee's obligation to pay royalty on gas\n      production, see John Burritt McArthur, A Minority of One? The Reasons to Reject the Texas Supreme Court's Recent Abandonment\n      of the Duty to Market in Market–Value Leases, 37 Tex. Tech Law Rev. 271, 274 (2005) (“Oklahoma requires the lessee to share\n      the price it receives in any sales contract into which it enters in good faith”); Bruce M. Kramer, Interpreting the Royalty Obligation\n      by Looking at the Express Language: What a Novel Idea? 35 Tex. Tech Law Rev. 223, 248–49 (2004) (discussing Tara Petroleum\n      Corp. v. Hughey, 630 P.2d 1269 (Okla.1981)).\n17    See Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 698 (in similar context, the litigation of disputes over natural gas agreements entered into in the 1940s,\n      the court noting that despite the passage of decades and marked changes in the ways of marketing of natural gas, courts “interpret\n      the obligations and rights of the parties according to their expressed intent when they entered the agreement”).\n18    The royalty owners do not contend that OPL's predecessors acted unreasonably as operators by initiating the CO2 injection program\n      or that OPL's maintenance of the injection program is unreasonable. It would seem then that analysis of the casinghead gas marketing\n      actions required of a reasonably prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances necessarily would take the consequences\n      of that program, including the resulting high CO2 content of the gas, into account.\n19    OPL also presents arguments that Alguire's opinions were based in part on sales too far removed geographically from those at issue\n      here. We do not reach those arguments.\n20    See, e.g., Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 708.\n\n21    Alguire's testimony makes clear that her omission of the injected CO2 content from her analysis was intentional. It was a part of the\n      instructions she received for preparation of her study.\n22    Alguire candidly acknowledged on cross-examination, for instance, that her study did not include a single contract for gas containing\n      CO2 in the 50% range with a percentage of proceeds higher than the 33.3%, 50% percentages on which the royalty owners were\n      paid royalty. Later in her cross-examination testimony, Alguire made reference to one contract in New Mexico under which gas\n      containing 25% CO2 was sold for 88% of proceeds. She acknowledged the contract would not be comparable to the higher CO2\n      levels in the Slaughter Estate Unit gas.\n23    Our discussion of this issue applies to the extraneous CO2 transported to the field, injected by OPL into the producing formation and\n      recovered along with the casinghead gas by OPL. The royalty owners contend the summary judgment evidence raised an issue of fact\n      whether OPL is producing CO2 that is “native” to the leased lands. We have examined the documents on which the royalty owners\n      rely for the contention, which are an affidavit of their expert Charles Graham and a memorandum of one of their attorneys. We do\n      not agree that either of those documents provides evidence precluding summary judgment on their claims for royalty on CO2.\n24    As we understand their theory, the royalty owners contend they are entitled to royalty each time the CO2 is recycled through the\n      producing formation.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d 392 (2011)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 1072\n\n25    The unit agreement for the Slaughter Estate Unit, for example, gives the working interest owners the right to inject into the unitized\n      formation “any substances in whatever amounts [they] deem expedient.”\n26    Unit agreements for the Central Mallet Unit and the Slaughter Estate Unit, for example, contain provisions limiting royalties on\n      certain “outside substances” injected into the unitized formation until other events occur. The parties disagree on the effect of that\n      language but, as noted, we do not read the royalty owners' briefing to contend it would have the effect of requiring payment of royalty\n      not required under the leases.\n27    Relevant to the present facts, the court in Murchison found the law of original capture, which in general gives the owner of land\n      the right to produce all the oil and gas that will flow from a well on the land, inapplicable to gas that was originally captured and\n      subsequently restored. Murchison, 353 S.W.2d at 880.\n28    And we emphasize that we deal here only with a claim for royalty by lessors on extraneous CO2 injected and recovered by OPL. This\n      case does not involve claims of trespass or the like, nor does it involve claims to ownership of CO2 recovered by operators other than\n      OPL. Any such case would involve considerations not present here.\n29    The royalty owners' argument that language concerning gas or gaseous substances in the leases and unit agreements binds OPL to a\n      royalty obligation for CO2, would seem to underscore the similarity between CO2 and natural gas for this purpose.\n30    See, e.g., Tex.

Stem, J., entered summary judgment in favor of oil company and\nvarious purchasers of property abutting the highway, denied oil company and purchaser's their trial\nattorney fees, and awarded them appellate attorney fees. Vendor appealed. The Court of Appeals,\nDavis, C.J., held that: (1) statements in pleadings of purchasers and oil company that vendor\nreserved mineral rights in land conveyed to the state that abutted purchasers' properties did not\nnegate purchasers' and oil company's claims to mineral rights; (2) deeds that conveyed property\nabutting state highway did not rebut presumption that mineral rights were conveyed to center of\nhighway; (3) deed that purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in executive rights in\nminerals conveyed all of vendor's mineral rights in the property; and (4) trial court should not have\nawarded purchasers and oil company their appellate attorney fees.\n\nReversed and rendered in part, reversed and remanded in part.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (15)\n\n\n [1]    Appeal and Error             Extent of Review Dependent on Nature of Decision Appealed\n        from\n        30 Appeal and Error\n        30XVI Review\n        30XVI(A) Scope, Standards, and Extent, in General\n        30k862 Extent of Review Dependent on Nature of Decision Appealed from\n        30k863 In General\n        When the parties have filed competing motions for summary judgment and some are\n        granted while others are denied, an appellate court may consider the propriety of the denial\n        as well as the granting.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The parties (with the exception of James Bumpurs)\nfiled competing motions for partial summary judgment. The court granted the defendants' motions\nand denied Reagan's motion, decreeing that Reagan take nothing by his suit. Several months later,\nthe court signed a separate order granting the defendants their appellate attorney's fees but denying\ntrial attorney's fees. In the attorney's fee order, the court included a Mother Hubbard clause to\ndispose of any remaining issues and make its judgment final.\n\nReagan claims in three points that the court erred in granting the defendants' summary judgment\nmotions and denying his own because: (1) the plain language of the deeds at issue demonstrates that\nhe retained ownership of the minerals in question and thus the strip-and-gore doctrine should not\napply; (2) the judgment effectively deprives the State of its title to the surface estate of the property\nin question without the State's joinder or consent; and (3) Appellees (with the exception of James\nBumpurs) judicially admitted that Reagan had reserved ownership of the minerals to himself.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\nReagan argues in a fourth point that the court abused its discretion by awarding the defendants\ntheir appellate attorney's fees but not their trial attorney's fees because “such an award is calculated\nto sway [him] from appealing the trial court's ruling.”\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nPrior to the conveyances in question, Reagan owned a series of adjoining tracts of land in the\nMaria de la Concepcion Marquez Eleven Leagues Survey, Abstract No. 25 in Robertson County.\nAn undivided one-half interest in the minerals in the western portion of this acreage had been\nconveyed to others by Reagan's predecessors in title. 1 In 1949, Reagan conveyed a 14.116 acre\ntract of land to the State for construction of Highway 7, reserving the oil, gas and sulphur in the\nproperty to himself. Reagan conveyed 55.25 acres to Horace Bumpurs and his wife Evelyn in 1957\nwithout reserving any mineral interests. This tract lies on the northern side of Highway 7, and the\nlegal description in the conveyance expressly follows “the north line” of the highway. 47.679 of\nthese acres are involved in the current dispute. These 47.679 acres comprise Unit Tract Nos. 5, 6,\nand 9 on a well unit plat prepared *73 for Marathon Oil Company (“Marathon”).\n\nThe Marathon plat appears as follows:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\n\n\n\nIn 1958, Reagan conveyed to the State a 3.018 acre tract of land along the southern boundary of\nthe previously-conveyed 14.116 acre tract. Reagan again reserved the oil, gas and sulphur in this\nproperty to himself. The 14.116 acre tract and the 3.018 acre tract which Reagan conveyed to the\nState traverse the disputed properties as follows:\n\n\n*74\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\n\n\n\nReagan and his wife Frances conveyed a 304.22 acre tract on the southern side of Highway 7 to\nEmil Kmiec and Esidor Brounkowski in 1970, purporting to reserve an undivided one-half mineral\ninterest for life with right of survivorship. Similar to the Bumpurs conveyance, the legal description\nin the deed to Kmiec and Brounkowski expressly follows concrete highway markers set along\nthe southern boundaries of the tracts Reagan conveyed to the State for Highway 7. Brounkowski\nOil and Gas Partnership, Ltd. (“Brounkowski Oil”) presently owns this 304.22 acre tract. 139.177\nacres from this tract are involved in the present dispute. These 139.177 acres comprise Unit Tract\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11 on the Marathon plat.\n\nReagan and his wife Frances conveyed 1.026 acres to James Bumpurs and his wife Betty Jean\nin 1978. The legal description in this deed, like the conveyance to Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs,\nexpressly follows “the south line” of Highway 7. The Reagans did not reserve any mineral interests\nin this conveyance. The Marathon plat designates this tract as Unit Tract No. 4. 2\n\nIn 1993, the Brounkowskis, Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs, and James and Betty Jean Bumpurs\nexecuted mineral leases in favor of Marathon. 3 In April 1993, Reagan executed a document\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon pooled these tracts with an adjoining tract to form\nthe Brounkowski No. 1 Gas Unit. Marathon drilled a well in this unit which began to produce gas\nin November 1995.\n\nAfter Marathon refused to pay Reagan royalties for his claimed interest in the minerals in and under\nthe 17.134 acres he conveyed to the State, Reagan instituted this lawsuit to obtain a declaration\nof his ownership interest in the minerals located in and under the State's 17.134 acres. Marathon,\nBrounkowski Oil, Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs, and James Bumpurs all filed counterclaims for\ndeclaratory relief asserting that Brounkowski Oil and the Bumpurses own the disputed minerals.\n\nHorace and Evelyn Bumpurs filed a motion for partial summary judgment alleging that Reagan's\n1957 conveyance to them constituted a conveyance of the minerals to the center of Highway 7 as a\nmatter of law because Reagan did not reserve any mineral interests to himself in the conveyance.\nBrounkowski Oil and Marathon filed similar motions alleging that the 1957 conveyance to the\nBumpurses and the 1970 conveyance to Kmiec and Brounkowski conveyed the minerals to the\ncenter of Highway 7 as a matter of law because Reagan did not reserve any mineral interests\nin the conveyance to Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs and his attempted reservation in the Kmiec/\nBrounkowski conveyance is ineffective because of the undivided mineral interests conveyed by\nhis predecessors in title.\n\nReagan then filed a motion for partial summary judgment alleging that he is entitled to judgment\ndeclaring his ownership of the minerals in question as a matter of law because he expressly reserved\nthe minerals in his deeds to the State and the legal descriptions of the tracts conveyed to Horace\nand Eugene Bumpurs and Kmiec/Brounkowski do not overlap the legal descriptions of the tracts\nconveyed to the State.\n\nIn a January 1999 order, the court granted the motions for partial summary judgment filed by\nMarathon, Brounkowski Oil, and Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs. 4 The court denied Reagan's\nmotion. The court decreed that Reagan take nothing by his suit and rendered summary judgment\nin favor of the defendants “on all issues” except attorney's fees and court costs. The court\nsubsequently received evidence from the parties on attorney's fees. The court signed an order in\nMay 1999 denying defendants' trial attorney's fees and granting them appellate attorney's fees. The\ncourt denied Reagan's request for attorney's fees and concluded the order with a Mother Hubbard\nclause.\n\nAlthough a “Mother Hubbard” clause does not necessarily make a judgment final, we treat such\na judgment as final for purposes of appeal if it “actually disposes *76 of every pending claim\nand party.” Lehmann v. Har–Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 205 (Tex.2001). The partial summary\njudgment in this case expressly adjudicates the merits of every party's claim regarding the title\nto the disputed minerals and expressly disposes of “all issues except the recovery of attorneys'\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For these reasons, we conclude that\nthe court rendered a final, appealable judgment.\n\n\n\n                                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] [3] When the parties have filed competing motions for summary judgment and some\nare granted while others are denied, an appellate court may consider the propriety of the denial as\nwell as the granting. See Commissioners Court v. Agan, 940 S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex.1997); Sarandos\nv. Blanton, 25 S.W.3d 811, 814 (Tex.App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied). If the pertinent facts are\nundisputed, the court can determine the issues presented as a matter of law. See Sarandos, 25\nS.W.3d at 814. In this situation, the court will either affirm the judgment or reverse and render.\nSee Jones v. Strauss, 745 S.W.2d 898, 900 (Tex.1988); Tobin v. Garcia, 159 Tex. 58, 64, 316\nS.W.2d 396, 400–01 (1958); Sarandos, 25 S.W.3d at 814. Because the facts in this case are not\ndisputed, we will examine the summary judgment record to determine whether the facts establish\nthat Reagan or Appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 5 See Sarandos, 25 S.W.3d\nat 814.\n\n\n\n                                         THE LETTER RULING\n\n [4] Reagan contends in his second point that the court's decree effectively deprives the State of\nits title to the surface estate of the property in question without the State's joinder or consent.\nHe points to a pre-judgment letter from the court advising the parties of its ruling and requesting\nthat the defendants prepare an order reflecting the ruling. However, a pre-judgment letter does\nnot constitute competent evidence of the court's ruling. See Cherokee Water Co. v. Gregg County\nAppraisal Dist., 801 S.W.2d 872, 878 (Tex.1990); Maddox v. Cosper, 25 S.W.3d 767, 771 n. 5\n(Tex.App.—Waco 2000, no pet.). Moreover, the language in the letter of which Reagan complains\ndoes not appear in the judgment. Accordingly, we overrule Reagan's second point.\n\n\n\n                                         JUDICIAL ADMISSION\n\n [5] Reagan argues in his third point that Appellees judicially admit in their summary judgment\nmotions that he reserved the oil, gas, and sulphur under the disputed acreage in his conveyances\nto the State. Appellees respond that Reagan's reservation of these minerals is essential to either\nside's recovery. Otherwise, the State would own the disputed minerals.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                11\n\fReagan v.

Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Underwriters, Inc. for the proposition\nthat the assertions in Appellees' motions that he reserved these minerals constitute binding judicial\nadmissions. 606 S.W.2d 692, 694 (Tex.1980).

See Texas Dep't of\nCorrections v. Herring, 513 S.W.2d 6, 9 (Tex.1974); Brooks v. Center for Healthcare Servs.,\n981 S.W.2d 279, 283 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.); David Gavin Co. v.

Thus, the\nstatements in their pleadings that he reserved these minerals in his conveyances to the State do not\nconclusively negate Appellees' claim to the minerals nor do they conclusively establish Reagan's\nclaim. Accordingly, we overrule Reagan's third point.\n\n\n\n                                THE STRIP–AND–GORE DOCTRINE\n\nReagan contends in his first point that the record evidence establishes his ownership of the\nminerals under the disputed 17.134 acre strip as a matter of law. Appellees respond that the court\nproperly decided the matter by applying the strip-and-gore doctrine to the conveyances in question.\nThe parties' dispute centers primarily on whether the strip-and-gore doctrine applies to Reagan's\nconveyances to Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs (hereinafter, the “Bumpurses”) and to Kmiec and\nBrounkowski.\n\n\n\n                                             PERTINENT LAW\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Am., Inc., 787 S.W.2d 566, 568 (Tex.App.—Corpus\nChristi 1990, writ denied). A legal description which defines the property conveyed as extending\nonly to the boundary of the highway does not expressly rebut the presumption that the conveyance\nextends to the center of the highway. See Williams, 161 Tex. at 4, 335 S.W.2d at 836; Krenek, 787\nS.W.2d at 569. Nor do phrases such as “save and except” or “not including the road.” See Haines\nv.

See Krenek, 787 S.W.2d at 569 (citing Rio Bravo Oil Co. v. Weed, 121 Tex.\n427, 443, 50 S.W.2d 1080, 1086–87 (1932); *78 Couch v. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co., 99 Tex. 464,\n467, 90 S.W. 860, 860–61 (1906)). However, our research suggests that the Supreme Court has\ndisavowed this supposed exception to the general rule. 6\n\nThis exception appears to find its genesis in the Couch decision. In that case, John Couch owned\nthe land on both sides of a railroad right-of-way. He sold forty acres of this land located on the\neast side of the right-of-way to Norton and McGown. The legal description in this conveyance\nfollowed the northern line of the right-of way. Thereafter, the railroad drilled a water well on the\nnorthern side of the track in the right-of-way. Couch sued the railroad for conversion of the water\nobtained from the well. See Couch, 99 Tex. at 466–67, 90 S.W. at 860–61.\n\nThe Court acknowledged the general rule recited above but then concluded that it did not apply in\nCouch's case. Id. at 467, 90 S.W. at 860–61. The Court stated:\n\n            At the time the deed from Couch to Norton and McGown was made Couch\n            owned the land on both sides of the railroad, and after the sale the entire right of\n            way remained in connection with his land south of the railroad. Under this state\n            of facts there is no ground for a presumption that Couch intended to convey that\n            portion which lay between the line described in the deed and the railroad track.\n\nId. at 467, 90 S.W. at 861.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\nTwenty-six years later, the Court reviewed Couch and explained it as follows:\n\n            It is thus made clear that the presumption was not applied in that case by the\n            distinguished jurist who rendered the opinion for the obvious reason that the\n            grantor owned lands on both sides of the railroad. His failure to convey to\n            the center of the railroad right of way did not leave a narrow strip of land\n            disconnected from any other tract. Such strip was as much an appurtenant to the\n            grantor's remaining tract as it was to the tract conveyed. It was as valuable to him\n            as a part and parcel of his remaining tract as it was to the grantee. Evidently Judge\n            Brown declined to apply the presumption because of the recited fact that the\n            grantor, at the time of the conveyance, owned land on both sides of the railroad\n            right of way. There was no other reason for his stating such fact except for the\n            purpose of showing that no basis existed for the application of this presumption.\n\nWeed, 121 Tex. at 443, 50 S.W.2d at 1086–87. In our opinion, the Court began to disavow the\nCouch exception soon thereafter.\n\nIn Cox v. Campbell, T.M. Campbell owned property on both sides of the railroad right-of-way. He\nsold 108 acres along the northern side of the right-of-way to J.R. Castleberry in 1898. He sold fifty\nacres on the southern side of the right-of-way to G.B. Turner in 1904. The legal descriptions in\nboth conveyances followed the northern and southern boundaries of the right-of-way rather than\nextending to the centerline. See Cox v. Campbell, 135 Tex. 428, 430, 143 S.W.2d 361, 361–62\n(1940).\n\nIf the Court had followed Couch, it would have concluded that Campbell retained the entire right-\nof-way property when he made the first conveyance. See Couch, 99 Tex. at 467, 90 S.W. at 861.\nSix *79 years later, his conveyance to Turner would have carried with it the right-of-way property\nas an appurtenance to the southern tract. Campbell's heirs asked the Court to follow Couch. See\nCox, 135 Tex. at 437, 143 S.W.2d at 365. The Court acknowledged Couch but observed that “[t]he\nopinion in the Weed case is the latest expression of this Court upon that question, and, unless\noverruled, should control here.” Id. The Court concluded that Weed controlled and determined\nthat Campbell's first conveyance conveyed the northern half of the right-of-way to Castleberry\nand his second conveyance transferred the southern half of the right-of-way to Turner. 7 See Cox,\n135 Tex. at 437–38, 143 S.W.2d at 365–66.\n\nThe Court arguably overruled the Couch exception by implication in Cox. However, we believe\nthat the Court more forcefully did so in Haines. In that case, the parties on both sides of four\nadjoining rights-of-way traced their title to William J. McLean. McLean conveyed the 259 acre\ntract to A.F. Grabow. A county road and two adjoining railroads crossed this acreage at the time\nof the McLean Grabow conveyance. Grabow conveyed 127.8 acres to the east of these rights-\nof-way to D.P. Yoder. Grabow retained the remainder of the acreage until his death, at which\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\ntime it passed to Lydia Grabow Haines as part of a voluntary partition with Grabow's other heirs.\nHaines subsequently conveyed a 100 foot wide strip of land on the western side of the three\naforementioned rights-of-way to Scurry County for construction of U.S. Highway 84. The Yoder\nacreage passed by mesne conveyances to the Boothe plaintiffs, who with the Haines plantiffs\nsought to quiet title to the minerals underneath the rights-of-way as against McLean's heirs. 8\nHaines, 154 Tex. at 274–76, 276 S.W.2d at 778–79.\n\nIn trying to determine ownership of the disputed minerals as between the Boothe plaintiffs and\nthe Haines plaintiffs, the Court of Civil Appeals discussed the potential application of Couch.\nSee Boothe v. McLean, 267 S.W.2d 158, 168–69 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1954), rev'd sub. nom.\nHaines v. McLean, 154 Tex. 272, 276 S.W.2d 777 (1955). The Court determined that if Couch\nwere applied Grabow would have retained for himself the entirety of the disputed minerals because\nof his continued ownership of the land to the west of the rights-of-way. Id. at 169, 90 S.W. 860.\n *80 The Court decided, however, that “since the Couch decision, under a fact situation that cannot\nbe distinguished from those of the present case, our Supreme Court has held that the presumption\ndoes apply, despite the fact that the grantor who owned on both sides of a right-of-way conveyed\nthe land on the other side and retained that on the other.” Id. The Court concluded:\n\n            Our Supreme Court has held that the presumption of an intention to convey to\n            the center of an adjoining easement applies notwithstanding the fact that grantor\n            owned on both sides of the easement and conveyed the land on one side only by\n            a description that called for the grant to stop at the outer edge of the easement.\n\nId.; see also Joslin v. State, 146 S.W.2d 208, 210 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1940, writ ref'd).\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed this decision because the lower court concluded that the Grabow\nYoder deed effectively conveyed the eastern half of only the 60 foot right-of-way immediately\nadjoining the 127.8 acres conveyed, rather than the eastern half of the three adjoining rights-of-\nway. See Haines, 154 Tex. at 277, 276 S.W.2d at 780. Nonetheless, the Court fully endorsed the\nlower court's implied conclusion that Couch was no longer valid when the Court construed Cox\nand its progeny to mean that “even where the grantor owns at the time the land on both sides of\nthe easement, his conveyance of a tract adjoining one side carries fee title to the center line.” Id.\nat 281, 276 S.W.2d 777, 276 S.W.2d at 782. Thus, it appears that the Court overruled Couch by\nimplication, if not in Cox, then certainly in Haines.\n\n [9] The Supreme Court decisions cited above concern rights-of-way created by easements.\nNevertheless, the same rule applies to a mineral estate lying beneath a public highway in which\nthe State holds a fee estate in the surface.

However, the courts have held that this\ntype of legal description does not rebut the presumption that a deed conveying property adjoining\na public highway carries with it title to the center of the road. See Williams, 161 Tex. at 4, 335\nS.W.2d at 836; Krenek, 787 S.W.2d at 569; see also Haines, 154 Tex. at 281, 276 S.W.2d at 782;\nLewis, 136 Tex. at 157, 146 S.W.2d at 981; Moore, 719 S.W.2d at 376.\n\n [10] [11] Reagan goes farther, however, and refers to other portions of the legal descriptions\nwhich expressly extend the property conveyed to the center of other roads in the area. Nevertheless,\nto rebut the aforementioned presumption, a conveyance must contain an “express reservation” of\nthe property in question. Cox, 135 Tex. at 435, 143 S.W.2d at 364 (quoting Weed, 121 Tex. at 438,\n50 S.W.2d at 1084); accord State v. Fuller, 407 S.W.2d 215, 218 (Tex.1966) (quoting Haines, 154\nTex. at 288, 276 S.W.2d at 786); Moore, 719 S.W.2d at 376. Reagan's argument might support\nan implied reservation of the minerals in question. However, a reservation in a deed is “strongly\nconstrued against the grantor and in favor of the grantee.” Graham v. Kuzmich, 876 S.W.2d 446,\n449 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1994, no writ) (citing *81 Reeves v. Towery, 621 S.W.2d 209,\n212 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.)); accord Holmstrom v. Lee, 26 S.W.3d\n526, 531 (Tex.App.—Austin 2000, no pet.). Accordingly, we conclude that the deeds in question\ndo not contain express reservations sufficient to rebut the presumption that the conveyances carried\nwith them title to the center of the highway.\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that, when Reagan conveyed the northern tract to the Bumpurses,\nthe conveyance carried with it title to the oil, gas and sulphur under the northern half of the 14.116\nacre tract of land Reagan conveyed to the State in 1949. See Haines, 154 Tex. at 282–84, 276\nS.W.2d at 783–84. 9 Reagan's conveyance of the southern tract to Kmiec and Brounkowski carried\nwith it title to the oil, gas and sulphur under the southern half of the 14.116 acre tract and under\nthe entirety of the 3.018 acre tract he conveyed to the State in 1958, subject to the mineral interest\nhe reserved to himself and his wife in this conveyance.

It is further agreed that grantees *82 shall have\n   the exclusive right to make, execute and deliver oil, gas and mineral lease(s) on all of the oil,\n   gas and other minerals in, on and under said premises covered hereby including that portion\n   thereof reserved herein to Sellers for the lifetime of them and the survivor of them and grantees\n   further agree that in the event they shall enter into any oil, gas or other mineral lease(s) on said\n   premises, to be held to account to grantors, and the survivor of them, with respect to grantors\n   reserved mineral interests, for the highest price paid for oil, gas and mineral lease(s) on other\n   property in the vicinity of said premises during the same period of time that grantees may be\n   negotiating such lease(s); this shall apply to bonuses, delay rentals and royalties; this shall be\n   construed as a covenant between the parties hereto and shall never be interepreted as being\n   made for the benefit of any present or prospective lessee of the mineral interests and shall in\n   no way be considered as limiting the exclusive right of grantees to make, execute and deliver\n   such lease(s) on said premises. After the death of the survivor of grantors, all mineral interests\n   so retained to them and the survivor of them shall revert to and become the property of the\n   grantees, their heirs and assigns.\n [12] Under this reservation, Reagan and his wife reserved a life estate with right of survivorship\nin whatever mineral interest they reserved. See Deviney v. NationsBank, 993 S.W.2d 443, 451\n(Tex.App.—Waco 1999, pet. denied). The remainder will revert to the grantees, their heirs, or\nassigns at the death of the survivor of Reagan or his wife. Currently, Brounkowski Oil holds this\nreversionary interest.\n\n [13] “There are five essential attributes of a severed mineral estate: (1) the right to develop (the\nright of ingress and egress), (2) the right to lease (the executive right), (3) the right to receive\nbonus payments, (4) the right to receive delay rentals, [and] (5) the right to receive royalty\npayments.” Altman v.

In the Kmiec/Brounkowski conveyance, Reagan and his\nwife conveyed the executive rights in the minerals (attributes (1) and (2) in the Altman listing)\nto the grantees and reserved to themselves an undivided one-half interest in the remainder of the\nmineral rights. 11\n\nHowever, the Reagans' reservation is further burdened by the undivided one-half interest in the\nminerals conveyed to others by Reagan's predecessors in title. The reservation in question provides\nthat any outstanding mineral interests:\n\n            shall be first satisfied out of the oil, gas and mineral interests herein reserved\n            by grantors, so that grantees shall receive by this conveyance an undivided one-\n            half (½) interest in and to the oil, gas and minerals in, on and under the above\n            described 304.22 acres of land, more or less.\n\nThus, as to the minerals in and under Tract Nos. 1, 2, 10, and 11, Reagan conveyed an undivided\none-half interest to Kmiec and Brounkowski and reserved nothing for himself. Accordingly,\nBrounkowski Oil owns an undivided one-half interest *83 in the oil, gas and sulphur in and under\nthe southern half of the 14.116 acre tract conveyed to the State in 1949 and in and under the entirety\nof the 3 .018 acre tract conveyed to the State in 1958, insofar as those tracts lie within Tract Nos.\n2 and 10 on the Marathon plat. 12\n\nAs to the portion of the southern half of the 14.116 acre tract and the entirety of the 3.018 acre tract\nwhich lie within Tract No. 3 on the Marathon plat, Reagan and his wife own an undivided one-half\nnonexecutive interest in the oil, gas, and sulphur for life with a right of survivorship. Brounkowski\nOil owns the remainder of the oil, gas, and sulphur in this portion of Tract No. 3.\n\n\n\n                                                  SUMMARY\n\nThe undisputed facts in the summary judgment record establish as a matter of law that: (1) Horace\nand Evelyn Bumpurs own the oil, gas, and sulphur located in and under the northern half of the\n14.116 acre tract Reagan conveyed to the State in 1949; (2) Brounkowski Oil owns the oil, gas, and\nsulphur located in and under the southern half of said 14.116 acre tract and in and under the entirety\nof the 3.018 acre tract Reagan conveyed to the State in 1958, subject to a life estate reserved by\nDoyle and Frances Reagan; and (3) Doyle and Frances Reagan own a life estate with right of\nsurvivorship in a portion of the oil, gas, and sulphur owned by Brounkowski Oil.

See Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21\n(Tex.1998). At the attorney's fee hearing, counsel for Reagan contended that Appellees should\nbe entitled to minimal attorney's fees because their interests coincide. 13 Appellees' counsel\nresponded that their clients have divergent interests. Counsel for the Bumpurses further argued:\n\n\n   [W]e would ask the court to strongly consider awarding the appellate [attorney's] fees because\n   the only person who is in control of that is Mr. Reagan, and my clients have already had to pay\n   me a lot of money to defend the case, and we think it is just and equitable at a very minimum\n   to award those appellate fees to compensate them for something that Mr. Reagan has the sole\n   discretion to do.\nThe parties and their attorneys undoubtedly invested significant time and expense in pre-trial\npreparations and in the various hearings conducted in the trial court. However, the court declined\nto award Appellees any of their trial attorney's fees. Thus, the court's decision to award Appellees\ntheir appellate attorney's fees could serve only to place a financial disincentive before Reagan\nwhen deciding whether to take this appeal. See *84 United Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc.,\n729 S.W.2d 897, 906 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Because of this,\nand particularly in light of the fact that a reversal is required in this cause, we conclude that the\ncourt abused its discretion in this regard. Accordingly, we sustain Reagan's fourth point.\n\n\n\n                                                  CONCLUSION\n\nWe have determined that the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record establish as a matter\nof law that Reagan and his wife have a life estate with right of survivorship in a portion of the oil,\ngas, and sulphur located in and under the 14.116 acre tract Reagan conveyed to the State in 1949\nand in and under the 3.018 acre tract he conveyed to the State in 1958.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse that portion of the court's judgment which adjudicates the ownership of\nthe disputed minerals and render judgment that: (1) Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs own the oil,\ngas, and sulphur located in and under the northern half of the aforementioned 14.116 acre tract;\n(2) Brounkowski Oil owns the oil, gas, and sulphur located in and under the southern half of the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The surface ownership of this acreage is as follows: the State owns 17.134 acres; Horace\n        & Evelyn Bumpurs own 55.25 acres; Brounkowski Oil & Gas Partnership, Ltd. owns 304.22 acres; and James & Betty Jean Bumpurs\n        own 1.170 acres. The easternmost 57.789 acres are not subject to the undivided ½ interest in minerals conveyed to others by Reagan's\n        predecessors in title. These 57.789 acres encompass all of James & Betty Jean Bumpurs's acreage and portions of the tracts owned\n        by the State, Horace & Evelyn Bumpurs, and Brounkowski Oil. According to a well unit plat prepared for Marathon Oil Company,\n        these 57.789 acres comprise Unit Tract Nos. 3, 4, and 6. The acreage subject to the previously conveyed mineral interest includes\n        Unit Tract Nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, and 11. In this case, the parties seek to resolve the ownership of the oil, gas, and sulphur in and under\n        the 17.134 acres owned by the State. This acreage runs between Unit Tract Nos. 5, 6, and 9 to the north, and Unit Tract Nos. 2, 3,\n        4, and 10 to the south.\n2       The Marathon plat describes the tract owned by James and Betty Jean Bumpurs as containing 1.170 acres, while the Reagan Bumpurs\n        deed describes the tract as containing 1.026 acres. Because James and Betty Jean are not participating in this appeal, we will not\n        attempt to resolve this variance.\n3       The Brounkowskis executed their lease to Marathon in January 1993. Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs executed theirs in March 1993.\n        James and Betty Jean Bumpurs executed theirs in August 1993.\n4       The court rendered a summary judgment in favor of James Bumpurs in addition to the other defendants. However, James did not\n        file a summary judgment motion. Because Reagan does not contend that the court erred in this regard, the issue is not before us. See\n        Vawter v. Garvey, 786 S.W.2d 263, 264 (Tex.1990) (per curiam); Williams v. Bank One, Tex., N.A., 15 S.W.3d 110, 116 (Tex.App.\n        —Waco 1999, no pet.). Although Reagan named James as an appellee, James has not filed an appellee's brief. Instead, Reagan and\n        James have filed what appears to be a Rule 11 agreement with this Court. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 11. In this agreement, James agrees not\n        to seek his appellate attorney's fees as awarded by the trial court and to be bound by “the ultimate decision of the appellate court of\n        last resort” with respect to the dispute between Reagan and Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs. Reagan and James also agree that neither\n        “shall be required to make further response in the appellate courts with reference to the issues between them herein.” Pursuant to this\n        agreement, we will not further discuss the dispute between Reagan and James.\n5       We may also reverse and remand if resolution of the issues presented rests in disputed facts or if the parties' summary judgment\n        motions rest on different premises. See Sarandos v. Blanton, 25 S.W.3d 811, 814 & n. 5 (Tex.App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied).\n6       It appears that Krenek 's reliance on this exception had no bearing on the outcome of that case because it impacted only the court's\n        conclusion that the appellants obtained the disputed minerals under the residuary clause of their mother's will rather than through\n        devises of the adjoining acreage. See Krenek v. Texstar N. Am., Inc., 787 S.W.2d 566, 567–68 & n. 1 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi\n        1990, writ denied).\n7       A sound argument can be made that Couch and Weed are factually distinct and that the exception found in the former could continue\n        to apply after the latter decision. As previously stated, Couch involved a situation in which Couch owned the realty on both sides\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70 (2001)\n153 Oil & Gas Rep. 71\n\n      of the right-of-way and continued to own the realty on the western side of the right-of-way after conveying the realty on the eastern\n      side to Norton and McGowan. See Couch v. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co., 99 Tex. 464, 467, 90 S.W. 860, 861 (1906). Weed, on the other\n      hand, concerned a landowner Hebert who with his co-tenants partitioned a tract of realty into 8 lots. The partition resulted in four\n      lots lying to the north of a railroad right-of-way and four lots to the south. Subject to this partition, Hebert conveyed the eastern ½\n      of Lot 6 to Weed. As a result of the partition however, Hebert did not own Lot 3 which lay across the right-of-way from Lot 6. See\n      Rio Bravo Oil Co. v. Weed, 121 Tex. 427, 433–36, 50 S.W.2d 1080, 1081–83 (1932). Because Hebert did not own Lot 3, it could\n      be argued that Couch would not apply to his conveyance of Lot 6. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court apparently failed to attach any\n      significance to this distinction when it decided Cox. See Cox v. Campbell, 135 Tex. 428, 438, 143 S.W.2d 361, 366 (1940) (“We are\n      unable to distinguish the rule applicable to the facts of this case from the rule announced in the Weed case”).\n8     The opinion of the lower court provides additional details regarding these transactions. See Boothe v. McLean, 267 S.W.2d 158, 160–\n      61 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1954), rev'd sub. nom. Haines v. McLean, 154 Tex. 272, 276 S.W.2d 777 (1955).\n9     In Haines, the dispute involved the minerals under four adjoining rights-of-way. However, only three of these rights-of-way existed\n      when Grabow conveyed to Yoder the property east of the rights-of-way. Thus, the Court awarded to the Boothe plaintiffs title to the\n      minerals under the eastern half of the three rights-of-way in existence at the time of the conveyance to their predecessor in title Yoder.\n      See Haines, 154 Tex. at 282–84, 276 S.W.2d at 783–84. The Court awarded title to the minerals under the western half of these three\n      rights-of-way to the Haines plaintiffs in addition to the minerals beneath the fourth right-of-way on the western side of the other three,\n      which Lydia Grabow Haines had sold to Scurry County after the Grabow Yoder conveyance. Id. at 284–88, 276 S.W.2d at 784–87.\n10    Actually, Reagan reserved only the oil, gas and sulphur in his conveyances of the highway tracts to the State. Thus, it appears that\n      the State owns the remainder of the minerals in these 17.134 acres, subject to the undivided ½ interest in the minerals conveyed to\n      others by Reagan's predecessors in title. Nonetheless, the present dispute involves gas, which Reagan did reserve in his conveyances\n      to the State.\n11    Although the Court in Altman described the right to lease as the executive right, “the right to develop is a correlative right and passes\n      with the executive rights.” French v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 896 S.W.2d 795, 797 n. 1 (Tex.1995). Thus, the right to develop passed\n      to the grantees in the Kmiec/Brownkowski conveyance with the right to lease.\n12    Tract Nos. 1 and 11 do not adjoin the highway property.\n\n13    Brounkowski Oil has its own counsel, the Bumpurses have their own counsel, and Marathon has its own counsel. Each of these\n      attorneys (in addition to James Bumpurs's counsel) sought attorney's fees.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 81st Judicial District Court, La Salle County, Stella\nSaxon, J., entered summary judgment for defendants, and landowner appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Luz Elena D. Chapa, J., held that:\n\n[1] “surface estate” in agreement governing allocation of royalties from horizontal wells over\nadjoining mineral estates meant portions of earth over which estate owner held dominion after\nseverance of mineral estate;\n\n[2] horizontal well was situated on surface estates of both owner and neighbor;\n\n[3] provision that royalties payable under oil and gas lease from any well or wells shall be paid\nto owner of surface estate on which such well or wells are situated, “without reference to any\nproduction unit on which such well or wells are located,” meant that parties agreed to remove\nwell's location in production unit that included acreage from adjoining parties as basis for one\nparty demanding portion of royalties from well; and\n\n[4] under agreement, “well” meant entire length of underground hole or shaft between owner's\nand neighbor's estates.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CHAPA, Justice.\n\nIn this appeal from a declaratory judgment, we must construe a 1993 contract to determine the\nallocation of royalties from a horizontal well that begins on the property of the appellant, Springer\nRanch, Ltd., but ends under the property of Rosalie Matthews Sullivan, one of the appellees. Our\nconstruction will also govern the allocation of royalties to future horizontal wells covered by the\ncontract. The trial court held the contract required royalties from the horizontal well in dispute,\nand any future horizontal wells crossing the parties' property lines, must be allocated based on the\nproductive portions of the well underlying the parties' properties. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nOrigin of the Parties' Interests\nThe parties to this appeal are the heirs or successors-in-interest to Alice Burkholder, who owned\n8,545 acres of land in La Salle County, Texas, and Webb County, Texas. The property is centered\naround Encinal, Texas. Alice executed an oil and gas lease on the entire property in 1956 that\nis still in force today. Upon her death, Alice's will devised her property interest as a life estate\nin her husband, Joseph Burkholder. The will divided the remainder interest into three tracts and\ndevised the tracts to the parties' predecessors-in-interest. Joseph passed away in 1990, and the\nland was divided in accordance with the will. Springer Ranch, successor-in-interest *277 to\nBarbara Welhausen Springer, holds the portion of the original Burkholder tract “lying North of the\nKrugerville Road and West of Highway 81 [now U.S. Interstate 35].” Rosalie Matthews Sullivan,\nsuccessor-in-interest to Lawrence Matthews, holds the “land lying on the East side of Highway\n81 [I–35].” The “land lying South of the Krugerville Road and West of Highway 81” is held by\nsome combination of O.F. Jones III, Margaret Matthews, Ethel Matthews Rust, and Elizabeth\nMatthews, as successors-in-interest to Anthony Matthews. Springer Ranch and Sullivan own the\nentire undivided interests in their tracts of land and the lease benefits from their tracts. O.F. Jones\nand the remaining Matthews parties have entered into a partition agreement with respect to the\nthird tract.\n\nIn 1993, the parties to this appeal or their predecessors-in-interest executed the contract at issue\nin this case. The contract recites in part:\n\n   WHEREAS, a question has arisen as to the ownership of royalties payable under the\n   [Burkholder] lease to the owners of the various tracts of land above described; and\n\n   WHEREAS, the parties wish to settle such question by means of this instrument;\n\nThe operative language of the agreement provides:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\n\n            [the parties] contract and agree with each of the other parties, that all royalties\n            payable under the above described Oil and Gas Lease from any well or wells\n            on said 8,545.02 acre tract, shall be paid to the owner of the surface estate on\n            which such well or wells are situated, without reference to any production unit\n            on which such well or wells are located....\n\nThis agreement affected six vertical wells at the time it was made with two wells situated on each\nsubdivided tract.\n\n\nPresent Controversy\nThis 1993 contract operated for almost two decades prior to the drilling of the first horizontal well\nunder the Burkholder lease. This well, the Springer Ranch No. 2 well (“the SR2 well”), begins\non Springer Ranch's property, crosses the boundary line between Springer Ranch's property and\nRosalie Matthews Sullivan's property, and terminates under Sullivan's property. When Sullivan\nbecame aware of the nature of the SR2 well, she negotiated with Springer Ranch to receive a\nportion of the royalties from that well. After those negotiations failed, she made a demand for a\nportion of the royalties to the well's operator. The operator ceased paying royalties until the dispute\nwas resolved between Springer Ranch and Sullivan. We have reproduced the following image\nfrom the record to illustrate the situation of the SR2 well.\n\n\n\n\n*278 With respect to the SR2 well, Springer Ranch is in the position of “Surface Owner A,” and\nSullivan is in the position of “Surface Owner B.” The illustration does not purport to be to scale.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  11\n\fSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v. Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\nSpringer Ranch then sued Sullivan and the other parties in a declaratory judgment action. It moved\nfor summary judgment, seeking a declaration that it was entitled to receive all the royalties from\nthe SR2 well under the 1993 contract, and that the same allocation applied to future horizontal\nwells covered by the contract. Its proposed construction at trial and on appeal is succinctly stated\nin its brief:\n\n   The words in the Royalty Agreement work in harmony to establish a very simple mechanism\n   by which the parties' 1992–93 controversy was settled. “All” royalties, meaning 100% without\n   division, were to be paid to “the” owner, meaning a single exclusive owner, who owned the “the\n   surface estate on which such well [is] situated,” meaning the visible location on the land from\n   which hydrocarbons exited, “without reference to any production unit on which such well or\n   wells are located,” meaning without any regard to the acreage that “can reasonably be considered\n   to be productive of hydrocarbons.” That is what is required by the plain meaning of the words.\n   That construction employs and harmonizes all the words used.\n\nThe defendants (collectively referred to as “the Matthews”) filed a competing motion for summary\njudgment, asking the trial court to allocate the royalties to the SR2 well between Springer Ranch\nand Sullivan based on the location of the productive portions of the well. Their argument rests\non the premise that the SR2 well is “situated on” both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's “surface\nestates” within the meaning of the 1993 contract. Thus, Springer Ranch and Sullivan are entitled\nto “all” the royalties from the “productive portions” of the SR2 well “situated” on their “surface\nestates.” As part of their summary judgment evidence, the Matthews offered the affidavit of a\npetroleum engineer to show how “all” the royalties from the portions of the well “situated on”\nthe respective “surface estates” could be *279 determined and allocated. They also sought a\ndeclaration that the same formula be applied to future horizontal wells.\n\nThe trial court held a hearing on the parties' motions. After the hearing, the court issued this\njudgment:\n\n            (i) the June 3, 1993 agreement referred to by the parties as the Royalty\n            Agreement, concerning ownership of royalties under the October 5, 1956 oil\n            and gas lease recorded in Volume 5, Page 151 of the Oil and Gas Records of La\n            Salle County, Texas, is unambiguous; (ii) the Royalty Agreement requires that\n            the royalties from the Springer Ranch No. 2 well be divided between Defendant\n            Rosalie Sullivan and Plaintiff Springer Ranch Ltd. based on the productive\n            portions of the well situated on their properties; (iii) Defendant Rosalie Sullivan\n            is entitled to receive royalty of .08500689 of production from the well and\n            Plaintiff Springer Ranch, Ltd. is entitled to receive royalty of .03999311 of\n            production from the well; (iv) royalties from any future horizontal wells that are\n            subject to the Royalty Agreement and that are situated on more than one tract\n            of land and owned by any of the parties to this suit or their heirs, successors,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Dorsett, 164\nS.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005). “When reviewing a summary judgment, we take as true all evidence\nfavorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts\nin the nonmovant's favor.” Id. “When both parties move for partial summary judgment on the\nsame issues and the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, as here, the reviewing\ncourt considers the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determines all questions\npresented, and if the reviewing court determines that the trial court erred, renders the judgment\nthe trial court should have rendered.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                   CONTRACT INTERPRETATION\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] “If the written instrument is so worded that it can be given a certain\nor definite legal meaning or interpretation, then it is not ambiguous and the court will construe\nthe contract as a matter of law.” Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex.1983). In construing\nan unambiguous contract, our primary concern is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties\nas expressed in the agreement. Valence Operating, 164 S.W.3d at 662. The parties' intentions\nshould be understood in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the contract's execution\nso long as those circumstances inform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract's text.\nHouston Exploration Co. v.

It is the\nparties' objective intent, as expressed in the document, not their subjective intent, which may not\nhave been expressed, that controls our construction of the contract. Matagorda County Hosp. Dist.\nv. Burwell, 189 S.W.3d 738, 740 (Tex.2006) (per curiam). To ascertain the parties' objective intent,\nwe “should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all\nthe provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.” Valence Operating, 164\nS.W.3d at 662.

However, one of the parties questioned the division orders after\ndiscovering that a well situated on an adjoining party's property was located within a “production\nunit,” almost half of which included acreage from his property. 2 The operator again suspended\nroyalty payments until the 1993 agreement was reached.\n\nIn 1993, each of the three sets of parties had two vertical wells on their “surface *281 estates,”\nwhose “production units” included acreage from an adjoining party's property. Therefore, the\nparties agreed each party would receive all the royalties from the wells “situated on” their “surface\nestate” and would forego any claims to the royalties from wells on the adjoining parties' surface\nestates. Bearing in mind the surrounding circumstances, we turn to the contract's text.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Matthews' summary judgment evidence also included the affidavit of a\npetroleum engineer, who stated “[w]hile the surface location of the wellhead is on Springer Ranch\nproperty, the well is situated on both Ms. Sullivan's and Springer Ranch property.”\n\nThe Matthews' expert's affidavit suggests, and we agree, that Springer Ranch's construction\nrequires “well” to be conflated with the term “wellhead,” which is the top of the hole from which\nhydrocarbons exit, or the visible structure over the well. See SHORTER OXFORD ENGLISH\nDICTIONARY 3606, at 2 b (defining “wellhead” as “[a] structure erected over an oil well or gas\nwell”); Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1342, at 3 (defining “wellhead” as “the top of\nor a structure built over a well”); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2595, at 3 a, b\n(defining “wellhead” as “the top of a well ... a structure built over the top of a well.”). In its brief,\nSpringer Ranch states “[t]here is no other surface location for the well other than the wellhead\nlocated on Springer Ranch's property.” However, Springer Ranch does not cite any support for\ntheir necessarily limited definition of “well” or its conflation of “well” and “wellhead.” Although\nwe are aware “well” may be colloquially used in this way, we decline to *282 construe the word\nin a way that contravenes its technical, legal, and dictionary definitions.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SHORTER OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 2000, at 5;\nMERRIAM–WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 811, at 2 c; WEBSTER'S THIRD\nNEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1574, at 1 c. For instance, oil is said to be “on” one's\nproperty. See, e.g., Fleming v. Ashcroft, 142 Tex. 41, 175 S.W.2d 401, 404 (1943) (“[O]n account\nof discovery of oil on the tract....”). “On” is sometimes used in this sense with “well.” See, e.g.,\nBP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d 59, 63 (Tex.2011) (referring to “good-faith efforts to\ndevelop a well on the Marshall lease....”). Both parties argue that their definition of “on” is the\nonly one consistent with the other uses of “on” in the contract's operative language: “from any\nwell or wells on said 8,545.02 acre tract” and “without reference to any production unit on which\nsuch well or wells are located.” Because “on” is so versatile, that argument is not persuasive for\neither party's construction.\n\n\n• “surface estate”\n [13] [14] [15] [16] We next examine the meaning of the term “surface estate.” The “surface\nestate,” strictly construed, is not “land” or any other kind of physical or corporeal structure on\nwhich a well may be situated. Instead, it is a “legal unit of ownership in the physical land.” Averyt\nv. Grande, Inc., 717 S.W.2d 891, 894 (Tex.1986) (“ ‘Land’ is the physical earth in its natural state,\nwhile an estate in land is a legal unit of ownership in the physical land.”). But it is fair, when\nconstruing a writing, to equate the “surface estate” with the physical or corporeal structures of the\nearth over which the surface estate owner has dominion, or owns. See, e.g., Dunn–McCampbell\nRoyalty Interest, Inc. v. Nat'l Park Serv., 630 F.3d 431, 442 (5th Cir.2011) (citing Averyt, 717\nS.W.2d at 894). In this case, such a construction is necessary if the 1993 contract is to be given\nmeaning under either party's construction. Separate surface and mineral estates do not come into\nexistence until there is a grant of the minerals in a deed or lease, or a reservation in a conveyance.\nSee Moser v. U.S. Steel Corp., 676 S.W.2d 99, 101 (Tex.1984). Therefore, in order to give meaning\nto the phrase “surface estate on which such well or wells are situated,” we construe the term\n“surface estate” to mean the portions of the earth, over which the surface estate owner holds\ndominion after a severance of the mineral estate. See Dunn–McCampbell, 630 F.3d at 442; Averyt,\n717 S.W.2d at 894; Moser, 676 S.W.2d at 101; BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1580 (defining\n“surface interest” as “every right in real property other than the mineral interest”).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SUMMERS, THE LAW\nOF OIL AND GAS § 4, at 4–17 (West 1954). Hydrocarbons reside within porous formations or\nreservoirs of rock under immense pressure from the overlaying earth. 2 SMITH & WEAVER,\nTEXAS LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 8.2[A], at 8–16.8; 1 SUMMERS, THE LAW OF OIL AND\nGAS § 4, at 10. When the porous reservoir is pierced by a well, the pressure of the impermeable\nearth above the reservoir and internal forces from within the reservoir, such as water trapped with\nthe hydrocarbons, push the hydrocarbons out of the formation and into the well. 2 SMITH &\nWEAVER, TEXAS LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 8.2[A]-[C], at 8–16.8–8–22; 1 SUMMERS, THE\nLAW OF OIL AND GAS § 4, at 15.\n\n [18] With that understanding in mind, we note ownership of the hydrocarbons does not give the\nmineral owner ownership of the earth surrounding those substances. Emeny v. United States, 188\nCt.Cl. 1024, 412 F.2d 1319, 1323 (1969) (per curiam). In Emeny, the defendant mineral lessee was\nobtaining production from a gas formation. 412 F.2d at 1321. The defendant injected helium gas\ninto the reservoir, which it had brought in from outside sources, and also injected helium gas from\nother producers who paid the defendant to store it in the reservoir. Id. at 1321–23. The injection\nof helium gas was unnecessary to the production of the hydrocarbon gas. 5 Id. at 1324. The court\nheld that the right to use a gas reservoir for the storage of helium-gas mixtures and pure helium\ngas produced elsewhere was vested in the surface estate owners and not in the defendant mineral\nowner. Id. at 1320. The court explained “[t]he surface of the leased lands and everything in such\nlands, except the oil and gas deposits covered by the leases, were still the property of the respective\nlandowners.” Id. at 1323. “This included the geological structures beneath the surface, including\nany such structure that might be suitable for the underground storage of ‘foreign’ or ‘extraneous'\ngas produced elsewhere.” Id. That holding has been cited with approval by the Texas Supreme\nCourt. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. West, 508 S.W.2d 812, 815 (Tex.1974).\n\n [19] Emeny 's holding also accords with the nature of the mineral estate. See Coastal Oil & Gas\nCorp. v. Garza Energy Trust, 268 S.W.3d 1, 15 (Tex.2008); Dunn–McCampbell Royalty Interest,\nInc. v. Nat'l Park Serv., 630 F.3d 431, 441–42 (5th Cir.2011). As the Texas Supreme Court has\nexplained:\n\n            While a mineral rights owner has a real interest in oil and gas in place, this\n            right does not extend to specific oil and gas beneath the property; ownership\n            must be considered in connection with the law of capture, which is recognized\n            as a property right as well. The minerals owner is entitled, not to the molecules\n            actually residing below the surface, but to a fair chance to recover the oil and\n             *284 gas in or under his land, or their equivalents in kind.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\n\nCoastal Oil, 268 S.W.3d at 15 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Relying on Coastal\nOil, the Fifth Circuit has determined that “Texas law establishes that the holder of a mineral estate\nhas the right to exploit minerals, but does not own the subsurface mass.” Dunn–McCampbell, 630\nF.3d at 442; see also id. at 441 (“[T]he conveyance of mineral rights ownership does not convey\nthe entirety of the subsurface.”).\n\n [20] Springer Ranch argues that relying on cases dealing with the disputes between the rights\nor boundaries of the surface and mineral estate owners (e.g., Emeny and Dunn–McCampbell) is\nimproper because “[n]one of these cases concern the parties' identification, among competing\n‘mineral estate’ owners, for the purpose of the payment of royalties for the actual production of\noil and gas from the subsurface.” We fail to see why the meaning of “surface estate” should vary\nfrom one context to another. Springer Ranch also argues that treating the well as situated on the\nsurface estate conflates surface estate and mineral estate. We note that the physical structures\nand subsurface substances that the surface estate and mineral estate owners possess are inherently\nintertwined, at least with respect to hydrocarbons. See SMITH & WEAVER, TEXAS LAW OF\nOIL AND GAS § 8.2[A]-[C], at 8–16.8–8–22; 1 SUMMERS, THE LAW OF OIL AND GAS §\n4, at 4–17. Some conflation is unavoidable. However, if there are no minerals beneath the surface,\nthe mineral estate owner owns the legal fiction of an estate that is nothing. Dunn–McCampbell,\n630 F.3d at 441.\n\n [21] In light of the contract's language, physical facts of the mineral and surface estates, and\nthe applicable case law, we conclude that the SR2 well—“the shaft or hole bored or sunk in the\nearth through which the presence of minerals may be detected and their production obtained”—is\nsituated “on” more than one “surface estate,” consistent with the Matthews' construction. Royalties\nfrom the well therefore should be allocated between Springer Ranch and Sullivan.\n\n\n“without reference to any production unit on which such well or wells are located ”\n [22] The contract explicitly bars the payment of royalties on the basis that the SR2 well's\n“production unit” includes acreage from both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's properties. Springer\nRanch complains that the trial court violated this provision by allocating royalties “based on\nthe productive portions of the well situated on [the parties'] properties,” arguing that the 1993\ncontract bars any division or allocation of the royalties between adjacent parties of the subdivided\nBurkholder tract. We disagree.\n\nAs noted above, the parties have offered competing interpretations of “production unit,” which\nis not a term that carries any standardized oil and gas meaning. Without choosing to apply one\ndefinition over the other, we note that this provision is at the heart of the 1993 contract in light\nof the surrounding circumstances. The contract was made because one of the parties questioned\nwhether he should receive royalties from a well that, although it was on an adjacent party's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                18\n\fSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v. Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\nproperty, was located in a production unit which included much of its acreage from his property. 6\nThe contract's recitals and the surrounding circumstances *285 confirm that this dispute and the\ndesire to promptly resume royalty payments was the impetus for the 1993 contract. The objective\nmeaning of this provision was to remove a well's location in a production unit that included acreage\nfrom adjoining parties as a basis for one party demanding a portion of the royalties from the well.\nTherefore, the parties agreed to allocate royalties on the basis of a well's situation on a party's\nproperty and not on the basis of a well's location in a production unit comprised of adjoining\nparties' acreage.\n\nWe find it unnecessary to discuss the virtues of the parties' competing definitions of the term\n“production unit” because it is clear that the court's judgment does not allocate royalties based\non the fact that the SR2 well's “production unit” includes acreage from both Springer Ranch's\nand Sullivan's properties. 7 That would have been prohibited under the 1993 contract. But the\nallocation of royalties on the basis that a well is situated on two surface estates does not contravene\nthis provision and does carry out the intent of the earlier provision.\n\n\nThe Division and Allocation Formula\nSpringer Ranch argues that if a well may be situated on more than one surface estate, the allocation\nof royalties based only on the “productive portions” of the SR2 well is incorrect, and that royalties\nshould be allocated on the basis of the entire length of the well “on” the parties' property and not\njust the productive portions. We disagree, and conclude the trial court's allocation was a necessary\nconsequence of the contract's language and was supported by the evidence before it.\n\n [23] The contract allocates “all royalties payable under the above described Oil and Gas Lease\nfrom any well or wells ...” A royalty is a fraction of the SR2 well's production, free of the costs\nof production, paid to the mineral lessor. See Heritage Res., 939 S.W.2d at 121–22. Production\nfrom a well, whether horizontal or vertical, is not obtained from the entire length of the well, but\nfrom the part of the well that pierces and drains the reservoir in which the hydrocarbons reside.\nSee 2 SMITH & WEAVER, TEXAS LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 8.2[A]-[C], at 8–16.8–8–22; 1\nSUMMERS, THE LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 4, at 15. A vertical well may produce hydrocarbons\nfrom different formations within its vertical line. See 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.10 (2013)\n(Tex.R.R. Comm'n, Restriction of Production of Oil and Gas from Different Strata). A horizontal\nwell only produces hydrocarbons from the part of the well that lies within the hydrocarbon-bearing\nreservoir, or “correlative interval.” See 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.86(a)(1) (2013) (Tex.R.R.\nComm'n, Horizontal Drainhole Wells). Along the horizontal displacement are takepoints through\nwhich hydrocarbons flow into the well. See Browning Oil Co. v. Luecke, 38 S.W.3d 625, 634–\n35 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. denied). A royalty, as a fraction of production, is only obtainable\nfrom the part of the SR2 well actually within the correlative interval. Despite Springer Ranch's\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  19\n\fSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v. Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\nargument that the calculation should be based on the whole length of the well, it is not the whole\nlength of the well from which production is obtained. See id.\n\nThe Matthews' expert measured the total distance between the SR2 well's first *286 and last\ntakepoints within the correlative interval, the distance between its first takepoint and the property\nline between Sullivan and Springer Ranch's properties, and the distance between the property line\nand the well's last takepoint. The expert multiplied the one-eighth royalty provided under the 1956\nlease by the ratio of the total distance between the first and last takepoints to allocate the royalties.\nHe calculated: “[i]f the royalty were divided based on the length of open drainhole situated on each\nrespective tract, Ms. Sullivan's net revenue interest in the well based on the one-eighth lease royalty\nwould be 0.08500689 (2,615.9/3,846.6 x 1/8) and Springer Ranch's share would be 0.03999311\n(1,230.7/3, 846.6x 1/8).” Springer Ranch did not dispute the expert's measurements or calculations,\nnor did it offer evidence of any other basis for determining how much production was obtained\nfrom the parts of the well on the parties' respective surface estates. Therefore, there is summary\njudgment evidence supporting the trial court's judgment allocating “all royalties” payable from\nthe SR2 well based on the “productive portions of the well situated on [Springer Ranch's and\nSullivan's] properties.” 8\n\n\nOur Construction\n [24] Having reviewed the contract's terms, we agree with the Matthews' construction as it is the\nonly plausible construction. Their construction of the word “well” to mean the entire length of the\nunderground hole or shaft, comports with the legal, technical, and dictionary meaning of the term.\nSee Valence Operating, 164 S.W.3d at 662 (We give the contract's terms “their plain, ordinary,\nand generally accepted meanings unless the contract itself shows them to be used in a technical\nor different sense.”). We see no basis in light of the surrounding circumstance or the text of the\ncontract to limit the term or conflate it with “wellhead.” The SR2 well is situated on two “surface\nestates.” See Emeny, 412 F.2d at 1323; Dunn–McCampbell, 630 F.3d 431, 441–42 (citing Coastal\nOil, 268 S.W.3d at 15). Therefore, the royalties must be allocated on the basis that the productive\nportions of the SR2 well are situated on both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's properties. But no\nroyalties may be allocated on the basis that the production unit within which the SR2 well is located\nincludes acreage from both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's properties.\n\nSpringer Ranch argues the parties' past practice and history support its construction and point to\nevidence showing the royalties from previous wells located in production units with acreage from\nadjacent parties were allocated only to one party. See Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Ponsford Bros.,\n423 S.W.2d 571, 575 (Tex.1968). We disagree. Springer Ranch's argument presupposes that its\nconstruction was the correct one, but both Springer Ranch's and the Matthews' constructions were\nconsistent with the past twenty years of vertical well drilling. In addition, we have explained that\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    20\n\fSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v. Jones, 421 S.W.3d 273 (2013)\n178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\nthe Matthews' construction does not allocate royalties on the basis of combined production unit\nacreage.\n\nSpringer Ranch also argues that the Matthews' construction improperly incorporates horizontal\nwell concepts that were not contemplated at the time the parties entered into the 1993 contract and\nthat the *287 failure of the parties to anticipate a change in technology does not justify rewriting\nthe contract in favor of the Matthews. See Marcus Cable Assocs. v. Krohn, 90 S.W.3d 697, 703–06\n(Tex.2002) (holding contractual easement for “electric transmission or distribution line or system”\ncould not be construed in light of technological advances to permit installation of cable television\nlines). We have not altered the meanings of “well,” “on,” “surface estate,” “production unit,”\nor “royalties” to accommodate a change in technology. Cf. id. The intent of the parties was to\nallocate royalties from “wells” without respect to “production units,” regardless of whether the\nparties contemplated the differences between vertical and horizontal wells. Cf. Browning Oil, 38\nS.W.3d at 640 (“The intent of the parties was to authorize pooling, but to prevent the dilution of the\nLueckes' royalties, whether the royalties represented production from vertical wells or horizontal\nwells.”). We have integrated horizontal-well concepts into our construction of the word “royalties”\nbecause, unlike a vertical well, the SR2 well crosses the surface estate of more than one party\nand obtains royalties from takepoints along its entire length within the correlative interval. Cf.\nid. at 642–46 (holding jury charge on damages was erroneous because the remedy for breach of\nanti-dilution provisions must be based on the facts of horizontal-well drilling). We find Springer\nRanch's complaint unpersuasive.\n\nAnother rule of contract construction supports our holding. The Texas Supreme Court has stated\nthat a court should construe contracts “ ‘from a utilitarian standpoint bearing in mind the particular\nbusiness activity sought to be served’ ” and “ ‘avoid when possible and proper a construction\nwhich is unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.’ ” Frost Nat. Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312 (quoting\nReilly, 727 S.W.2d at 530). In Frost, the Court held the court of appeals's construction of an\nequipment-lease agreement with a purchase option provision violated those precepts. Id. at 311.\nThe lessee had attempted to exercise the purchase option and buy the equipment a little over a year\ninto the five-year lease term, but the lessor refused, contending that the contract only allowed the\nlessee to purchase the equipment when the lease term ended. Id. The court of appeals construed\nthe lease to allow the lessee to exercise its purchase right when it terminated the lease little more\nthan a year after it began. Id. at 312.\n\nThe Court reversed and held the court of appeals committed two errors by construing the lease to\npermit the lessee to exercise the purchase option when it terminated the lease early.

When the 1993\ncontract was formed, each of the three sets of parties had two vertical wells on their respective tracts\nthat included acreage from an adjacent party's property in their production units. The operator of\nsome of those wells insisted that the parties agree on how the royalties from those wells would\nbe allocated. To resume royalty payments, the parties agreed they would forego claims based on\ncombined acreage within a production unit and would assign all royalties to the owner of the\nsurface estate on which a well was situated. The intent of the parties to the 1993 contract was to\nbar claims for royalties based on “production units,” not to allow one party to directly produce\nhydrocarbons from within the bounds of another's property. Cf. Browning Oil, 38 S.W.3d at 645\n(“The intent of the parties as evidenced by the language of these leases was to award the Lueckes\nroyalties for one-eighth of the oil and gas produced from their land, not to provide a punitive\nremedy for a breach of the pooling provisions.”).\n\nSullivan is entitled to one-eighth of the minerals within the bounds of her property under the lease.\nSee Japhet v.

Cf. Coastal Oil,\n268 S.W.3d at 14 (“The gas produced through a deviated well does not migrate to the wellbore\nfrom another's property; it is already on another's property.”). Springer Ranch's construction would\nhave us hold that the parties intended that a party would have the right to produce and deplete the\nminerals directly from within another party's property. If we were to adopt its construction and take\nit to its logical conclusion, Springer Ranch would receive all of the SR2 well's royalties because\n *289 the wellhead was on its property, even if the well obtained all of its production directly from\nunderneath Sullivan's tract. This is not a utilitarian construction in light of the business activity\nthe contract pertains to and is unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive. See Frost Nat.

The\nuncontroverted and only evidence before us shows the productive portion of the SR2 well under\nSpringer Ranch's property is the length of the well between the first takepoint and the property line.\nThe productive portion under Sullivan's property is the length of the well between the property\nline and the last takepoint. The portion of the royalties to which Springer Ranch and Sullivan are\nentitled is determined by the ratio of the productive portions of the SR2 well on their respective\nproperties to the entire length of the well, multiplied by the one-eighth lease royalty. The same\nproration of royalties shall apply to future horizontal wells on the parties' properties. We affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n421 S.W.3d 273, 178 Oil & Gas Rep. 532\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Division orders executed by royalty owners govern the distribution of oil and gas proceeds, directing to whom such proceeds will\n       be paid and in what proportion.

Springer Ranch argues that “production\n      unit” is synonymous with “proration unit.” In a separate reply brief, Jones argues that “production unit” referred to pooling units\n      created by the various owners of the lessee's interest.\n3     At oral argument, Springer Ranch conceded the normal meaning of “well” included the entire whole in ground.\n\n4     The mineral estate may include more than simply the ownership of hydrocarbons, if there was a general grant or reservation of\n      minerals. Moser, 676 S.W.2d at 101–02 (“We now hold a severance of minerals in an oil, gas and other minerals clause includes all\n      substances within the ordinary and natural meaning of that word, whether their presence or value is known at the time of severance.”).\n      The original Burkholder lease contains a general grant. However, the parties' 1993 contract in this case clearly pertains only to\n      hydrocarbons—which are produced from wells.\n5     If it had been necessary for recovery, the mineral owner likely would have had the authority to inject the gas because “[t]he mineral\n      owner, as owner of the dominant estate, has the right to make any use of the surface which is necessarily and reasonably incident\n      to the removal of the minerals.” Moser, 676 S.W.2d at 103.\n6     Whether that was a valid legal basis for apportioning royalties is not a question before us.\n\n7     Initially, the trial court forwarded a letter to the parties informing them of its summary judgment ruling. The letter stated “[t]he\n      unambiguous meaning of the Agreement that ‘royalties shall be paid to the owner of the surface estate on which the well is situated’\n      is that the horizontal well in question is situated on both Sullivan and Springer Ranch's properties.”\n8     Springer Ranch argues that “producing portions of the surface estate” is nonsensical because the surface estate owner has no rights\n      to minerals. That is true, but the question is not what rights do surface estate owners have to the minerals under their land but rather\n      what “surface estate” means in the context of a contract that allocates royalties on the basis of a well's physical situation.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellant, State Farm Lloyds\n(“State Farm”), filed this accelerated appeal on “a controlling question of law as to which there\nis a substantial ground for difference of opinion” pursuant to the version of Texas Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code section 51.014(d) in effect in 2010. Before we may reach the merits of the\n“controlling question of law,” *244 however, we must first address the threshold issue of whether\nthis court has jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. Because we conclude appellee, Dora\nGulley, the plaintiff below, did not agree to this appeal, we do not have jurisdiction and we must\ndismiss this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nGulley has maintained insurance on her house with State Farm since 1996. In 2007, Gulley\nfiled a claim under her policy for damage caused by foundation movement resulting from a\nbelow-slab plumbing leak. State Farm determined the damage was covered under the policy's\nDwelling Foundation Endorsement (“DFE”) and made payment to Gulley, subject to the fifteen\npercent coverage limitation. Although she accepted this payment, Gulley later sued State Farm\nfor breach of contract contending she was entitled to additional benefits under the policy's Water\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gulley and State Farm filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In\nGulley's October 2008 traditional motion for partial summary judgment, she argued the damage\nwas covered under both endorsements. In State Farm's April 2009 motion for traditional summary\njudgment, State Farm argued the damage was covered under only the DFE and was, therefore,\nsubject to the fifteen percent cap. State Farm's motion also included a no-evidence portion with\nrespect to Gulley's claim for additional living expenses.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the trial court signed an order denying both summary judgment motions.\nThereafter, Gulley filed a second motion for partial summary judgment with additional evidence,\nand State Farm filed a motion to reconsider its cross-motion for summary judgment as well as a\nnew “Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Actual Injury Rule, Non–Fortuitous Loss, and\nNon–Segregation of Claimed Damage.” On June 9, 2010, the trial court signed an order denying\nall motions, and the case was set for trial on August 23, 2010. On the eve of trial, Gulley's attorney\nsuggested the parties pass the trial date and seek an interlocutory appeal. On August 23, 2010,\nState Farm's attorney sent the following letter to Gulley's attorney, which Gulley's attorney signed\nas “Agreed”:\n\n            Pursuant to our conversation this morning, I am writing to confirm that we will\n            not be trying this case at this time. If we receive notice from the court that we\n            have been assigned, we agree to [1] pass on that assignment, [2] inform the court\n            that we have decided at this time to pursue an interlocutory appeal under Section\n            51.014 ... and [3] request that we be given a new trial date within the next 90 days\n            in the event we are unable to secure an interlocutory appeal for some reason. If\n            you are in agreement, please indicate by signing below and returning this letter\n            to me so that it can be filed as a Rule 11 Agreement with the Court....\n\nIn the meantime, also in August 2010, both parties filed motions to reconsider their summary\njudgment motions. On January 12, 2011, the trial court ruled that both parties' summary\njudgment motions were denied. Within the same written order, the court authorized an immediate\ninterlocutory appeal under section 51.014(d). On January 25, 2011, State Farm's attorney sent the\nfollowing letter to Gulley's attorney, which Gulley's attorney signed as “Agreed”:\n\n   I am writing to confirm the terms of our agreement regarding the contents of the order\n   authorizing an interlocutory appeal.... It is my understanding that you will agree to sign our\n   proposed order *245 which involves only one controlling question of law: [the same as above].\n\n   In return, State Farm will agree that in the event the Court of Appeals accepts this interlocutory\n   appeal [under section 51.014(d) ], State Farm will agree not to assert in any trial following the\n   decision from the Court of Appeals its defenses based on the Actual Injury Rule or the Non–\n   Fortuitous Loss argument.

State Farm Lloyds, 350 S.W.3d 204,\n207 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2011, no pet.). The cause was reversed and remanded to the trial court\nto allow the court “to make a substantive decision on the ‘matter of law’ question presented by the\nparties' competing summary judgment motions.” Id. at 208.\n\nFollowing remand, the trial court considered Gulley's earlier-filed second motion for partial\nsummary judgment and State Farm's earlier-filed motion to reconsider its cross-motion for\nsummary judgment. On August 17, 2011, the trial court granted Gulley's motion and denied State\nFarm's. Sometime in November 2011, Gulley's attorney informed State Farm that Gulley no longer\nwanted an interlocutory appeal, but instead, wanted to go to trial. In December 2011, State Farm\nfiled a “Motion to Enforce Rule 11 Agreement” based on Gulley's refusal to pursue an interlocutory\nappeal.\n\nAt the January 11, 2012 hearing on the motion to enforce, State Farm's attorney stated, “[i]t has\nbeen State Farm's position all along that this really was a matter of law issue and that it should\nhave been decided by summary judgment, which is why we came back twice trying to get that\ndone.” Gulley argued that the reason the parties initially agreed to an interlocutory appeal was\n“neither one of us had a trial ruling on the basic question. Had we had one, we wouldn't need an\ninterlocutory appeal because we would have been able to either settle it or try it based on a [trial]\ncourt ruling.” Gulley also argued:\n\n   ... We thought we could get the Court of Appeals to help us out. They would not do so. And so\n   now we're back where we started at square one, except we do have a trial court ruling. There's\n   no reason for an interlocutory appeal.\n\n                                                      ....\n\n   The basic point is that the Rule 11 [agreement] requires that the Fourth Court have accepted\n   that appeal. And we knew that they might not, because we had not found a case like this where\n   the trial court had not ruled on a summary judgment motion.....\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gulley, 399 S.W.3d 242 (2012)\n\n\n\nState Farm's attorney responded that Gulley's attorney was referring to the January 25, 2011 letter,\nbut the purpose of the August 23, 2010 letter was that the parties agreed they would not go to trial.\nState Farm's attorney stated he was trying to enforce only the August 23, 2010 agreement, which\n“clearly says we're going to pass on the trial, and we're going to pursue the appeal.” The trial court,\nfrom the bench, initially decided to overrule the motion to enforce, but after hearing additional\n *246 arguments, decided to take the matter under advisement. On January 12, 2012, the trial court\ngranted the motion to enforce, and, on January 27, 2012, State Farm again appealed to this court.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Gulley filed an “Objection on Jurisdictional Grounds to Defendant State\nFarm's Notice of Agreed Interlocutory Appeal.” Gulley argued that because this court “rejected”\nand “did not accept” the first interlocutory appeal, the Rule 11 agreement was no longer binding\non her.\n\n\n\n                                JURISDICTION OVER THIS APPEAL\n\nWe must determine whether the court has jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. Gulley asserts\nthat although she agreed to an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's two orders denying both\nparties' motions for summary judgment, such agreement was conditioned on this court “accepting”\nthat first appeal. Gulley contends this court did not “accept” the first interlocutory appeal and she\nhas not agreed to a second interlocutory appeal of the trial court's August 17, 2011 order granting\nher motion and denying State Farm's motion. State Farm counters that the Rule 11 agreement does\nnot restrict the interlocutory appeal to any specific order, and the agreement “manifests” the parties'\nintent to pursue an interlocutory appeal in order to have this court determine the “controlling\nquestion of law.” State Farm urges this court to interpret and enforce the parties' agreement as it\nwould any other Rule 11 agreement.\n\n [1] [2] Interlocutory orders not disposing of all parties are immediately appealable in only\nnarrow situations permitted by statute.

As with any other contract, our primary objective in\nconstruing a Rule 11 agreement is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions the parties have\nobjectively manifested in the written instrument. Trudy's Tex. Star, Inc. v. City of Austin, 307\nS.W.3d 894, 914 (Tex.App.-Austin 2010, no pet.). We interpret Rule 11 agreements based on the\nintention of the parties *247 from the language of the entire agreement in light of the surrounding\ncircumstances, including the state of the pleadings, the allegations therein, and the attitude of\nthe parties with respect to the issues. Garza v. Villarreal, 345 S.W.3d 473, 479 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 2011, pet. denied). Courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort\nto harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered\nmeaningless. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983). No single provision taken alone\nwill be given controlling effect; rather, all the provisions must be considered with reference to\nthe whole instrument. Id. We presume that the parties to a contract intend every clause to have\nsome effect. Ogden v. Dickinson State Bank, 662 S.W.2d 330, 332 (Tex.1983). An agreement\nbetween parties will not be given greater effect than intended. Austin v. Austin, 603 S.W.2d 204,\n207 (Tex.1980).\n\n[9] The August 23, 2010 agreement stated as follows:\n\n   Pursuant to our conversation this morning, I am writing to confirm that we will not be trying\n   this case at this time. If we receive notice from the court that we have been assigned, we agree\n   to [1] pass on that assignment, [2] inform the court that we have decided at this time to pursue\n   an interlocutory appeal under Section 51.014 ... and [3] request that we be given a new trial date\n   within the next 90 days in the event we are unable to secure an interlocutory appeal for some\n   reason. If you are in agreement, please indicate by signing below and returning this letter to me\n   so that it can be filed as a Rule 11 Agreement with the Court. [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                                      ....\n\nThe January 25, 2011 agreement stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gulley, 399 S.W.3d 242 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n   I am writing to confirm the terms of our agreement regarding the contents of the order\n   authorizing an interlocutory appeal.... It is my understanding that you will agree to sign our\n   proposed order which involves only one controlling question of law....\n\n   In return, State Farm will agree that in the event the Court of Appeals accepts this interlocutory\n   appeal [under section 51.014(d) ], State Farm will agree not to assert in any trial following the\n   decision from the Court of Appeals its defenses based on the Actual Injury Rule or the Non–\n   Fortuitous Loss argument. If the Court of Appeals does not accept this interlocutory appeal,\n   State Farm will still be entitled to assert any and all defenses in any trial following the rejection\n   of the interlocutory appeal by the Court of Appeals. [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                                                   ....\n\nAt the time the parties reached their Rule 11 agreement, the trial court had denied both motions, and\nthe parties sought recourse with this court by filing the first—agreed—interlocutory appeal in an\nattempt to obtain a ruling on the “controlling question of law.” We believe the parties' intention as\nexpressed in the agreement was that trial would be stayed and certain defenses would be foregone\non the condition this court accepted the first interlocutory appeal. Both the August 23, 2010 and the\nJanuary 25, 2011 agreement are silent as to any further actions the parties would take in the event\nthis court did not “accept” the interlocutory appeal. There is nothing in the Rule 11 agreement that\nindicates the parties intended the agreement to apply to more than one interlocutory appeal. In fact,\nthe language of the agreement unambiguously limits itself to “this [the first] interlocutory appeal.”\n\n *248 With this court having refused to “accept” the first appeal and the parties finally obtaining\na ruling from the trial court, we conclude Gulley did not agree to a second interlocutory appeal.\nTherefore, the trial court erred when it granted State Farm's motion to enforce the Rule 11\nagreements over Gulley's objection. Because Gulley did not agree to this interlocutory appeal,\nwe do not have jurisdiction and must dismiss. For this reason, we do not reach the merits of the\n“controlling question of law” raised on appeal.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n399 S.W.3d 242\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Amended by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 203 (H.B. 274), § 3.01, effective Sept. 1, 2011.

The 79th District Court, Brooks County, Benjamin Martinez, J.,\nentered judgment on jury verdict which found that tire manufacturer was strictly liable based on\ndefective design. Manufacturer appealed. The San Antonio Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant\npart, 928 S.W.2d 64. Manufacturer filed application for writ of error. On overruling of motion\nfor rehearing, the Supreme Court, Phillips, C.J., held that: (1) manufacturer who knew of safer\nalternative product design may be strictly liable for injuries caused by use of its product that\nuser could have avoided by following product's warnings; (2) tire was unreasonably dangerous;\n(3) evidence supported finding that 0.050” single strand programmed bead was safer, available\nalternative; (4) evidence that rim was defective did not bind jury; (5) manufacturer failed to\nconclusively prove that mechanic was contributorily negligent; (6) evidence of 34 other lawsuits\nbrought against manufacturer was admissible; (7) evidence that after explosion, manufacturer\nredesigned its radial light truck tires was admissible; and (8) refusal to bifurcate liability and\npunitive damages phases of trial was harmless error.\n\nAffirmed.\n\nHecht, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Enoch and Baker, JJ., joined, and in which Owen,\nJ., joined in part.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (21)\n\n\n [1]    Appeal and Error            Total failure of proof\n        30 Appeal and Error\n        30XVI Review\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Attached to the tire was a prominent warning label containing yellow and red highlights\nand a pictograph of a worker being thrown into the air by an exploding tire. The label stated\nconspicuously:\n\n\n\n                                                  DANGER\n\n   NEVER MOUNT A 16” SIZE DIAMETER TIRE ON A 16.5” RIM. Mounting a 16” tire on a\n   16.5” rim can cause severe injury or death. While it is possible to pass a 16” diameter tire over\n   the lip or flange of a 16.5” size diameter rim, it cannot position itself against the rim flange. If an\n   attempt is made to seat the bead by inflating the tire, the tire bead will break with explosive force.\n\n\n                                                         ...\n\n   NEVER inflate a tire which is lying on the floor or other flat surface. Always use a tire mounting\n   machine with a hold-down device or safety cage or bolt to vehicle axle.\n\n      NEVER inflate to seat beads without using an extension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck.\n\n      NEVER stand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.\n\n\n                                                         ...\n\n   Failure to comply with these safety precautions can cause the bead to break and the assembly\n   to burst with sufficient force to cause serious injury or death.\n   Unfortunately, Martinez ignored every one of these warnings. While leaning over the assembly,\n   he attempted to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” rim without a tire mounting machine, a safety cage,\n   or an extension hose. Martinez explained, however, that because he had removed a 16” tire from\n   the 16.5” rim, he believed that he was mounting the new 16” tire on a 16” rim. Moreover, the\n   evidence revealed that Martinez's employer failed to make an operable tire-mounting machine\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n   available to him at the time he was injured, and there was no evidence that the other safety\n   devices mentioned in the warning were available.\nIn their suit, the Martinezes did not claim that the warnings were inadequate, but instead alleged\nthat Goodrich, the manufacturer of the tire, Budd, the manufacturer of the rim, and Ford, the\ndesigner of the rim, were each negligent and strictly liable for designing and manufacturing\na defective tire and rim. Budd and Ford settled with the Martinezes before trial, and the case\nproceeded solely against Goodrich.\n\nAt trial, the Martinezes claimed that the tire manufactured by Goodrich was defective because it\nfailed to incorporate a safer alternative bead design that would have kept the tire from exploding.\nThis defect, they asserted, was the producing cause of Martinez's injuries. Further, they alleged that\nGoodrich's failure to adopt this alternative bead design was negligence that proximately caused\nMartinez's injury.\n\nThe bead is the portion of the tire that holds the tire to the rim when inflated. A bead consists of\nrubber-encased steel wiring that encircles the tire a number of times. When the tire is placed inside\nthe wheel rim and inflated, the bead is forced onto the bead-seating ledge of the rim and pressed\nagainst the lip of the rim, or the wheel flange. When the last portion of the bead is forced onto this\nledge, the tire has “seated,” and the air is properly sealed inside the tire. The bead holds the tire\nto the rim because the steel wire, unlike rubber, does not expand when the tire is inflating. The\ntire in this case was a 16” bias-ply light truck tire with a 0.037” gauge multi-strand weftless bead,\nor tape bead, manufactured in 1990. A tape bead consists of several strands of parallel unwoven\nsteel wires circling the tire with each layer resting on top of the last, similar to tape wound on a\nroll. After a number of layers have been wound, the end of the bead is joined, or spliced, to the\nbeginning of the same bead to form a continuous loop.\n\nThe Martinezes' expert, Alan Milner, a metallurgical engineer, testified that a tape bead is prone\nto break when the spliced portion of the bead is the last portion of the bead to seat. This is\ncommonly called a *333 hang-up. Milner testified that an alternative bead design, a 0.050” gauge\nsingle strand programmed bead, would have prevented Martinez's injuries because its strength\nand uniformity make it more resistant to breaking during a hang-up. Milner explained that the\n0.050” single strand programmed bead is stronger because it is 0.013” thicker and that it is uniform\nbecause it is wound, or programmed, by a computer, eliminating the spliced portion of the bead\nthat can cause the tire to explode during a hang-up.\n\nAccording to Milner, Firestone was the first to document that tape beads were prone to break\nduring hang-ups in a 1955 patent application. This application, which was granted three years\nlater, stated in part:\n\n            It has developed that in tires of the type now in common use that the grommet\n            of wire used becomes ruptured or broken too frequently at or near the end of the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n            wire splice when the tire bead is forced onto the rim bead seat during mounting\n            of the tire. Applicant has discovered that such breaking of the bead wire occurs\n            most frequently when the spliced portion of the bead wire grommet is located in\n            the last portion of the tire bead to be seated on the rim, and they have noted that\n            when an end of the said wire ribbon was disposed on the radial inner surface of\n            the bead grommet that the break started at or adjacent to that point.\n\nMilner testified that the design of the bead in the Goodrich tire in question was the same design\ncriticized in the patent. Milner also testified, relying on an internal memorandum that was admitted\ninto evidence, that in 1971 General Tire, one of Goodrich's competitors, knew its tape bead design\nwas prone to break during hang-ups.\n\nIn 1966, 16.5” wheel rims were first introduced into the American market. 1 Milner testified\nthat Uniroyal, Inc. and B.F. Goodrich Company, who in 1986 merged to form Goodrich, soon\nbecame aware that mismatching their 16” tires with the new wheel rims often caused hang-ups that\nresulted in broken beads. The minutes of a 1972 meeting of the Rubber Manufacturers Association\n(“RMA”), of which both Uniroyal, Inc. and B.F. Goodrich were members, provided:\n\n\n   Mounting of LT [light truck] tires. Attention was drawn to reports that there have been instances\n   where 16” LT tires have been mounted on 16.5” rims and 14” tires on 14.5” rims. It was proposed\n   and approved to request the Service Managers Committee to add a cautionary statement to RMA\n   documents.\n   Similarly, the minutes from a 1972 meeting of the Tire and Rim Association, of which Uniroyal,\n   Inc. and B.F. Goodrich were both members, provided:\n\n               It was reported that there have been incidents where 14” and 16” tires have\n               been mounted on 14.5” and 16.5” rims that have resulted in broken beads. The\n               Rim Subcommittee of the Technical Advisory Committee was requested to\n               consider some method of marking 15” Drop Center rims and wheels to avoid\n               this practice.\n\n  Finally, Milner testified that B.F. Goodrich's own testing department was aware by at least 1976\n  that a 16” tire mounted on a 16.5” rim would explode during a hang-up. A B.F. Goodrich “test\n  request” of that year was entered into evidence indicating that a 16” tire would explode when\n  mounted on a 16.5” rim at 73 psi (pounds of pressure per square inch). The test request further\n  indicated that “inspection revealed break was at [illegible] ends of bottom layer of [bead] wires\n  as anticipated.” The stated “Object of Test” was: “To develop demonstrative evidence & data\n  for use in lawsuits involving broken beads.”\nMilner explained that the computer technology required to manufacture the programmed bead\nwas developed in 1972 and widely available by 1975.

Finally, Milner testified that Goodrich itself began using\nthe single strand programmed bead in its 16” radial light truck tires in 1991. 2 Based upon this\nevidence and his expert opinion, Milner testified that the tire manufactured by Goodrich with a tape\nbead was defective and unreasonably dangerous. Because Goodrich had also been sued in thirty-\nfour other lawsuits alleging accidents caused by mismatching Goodrich tires, Milner asserted that\nGoodrich was grossly negligent in failing to adopt the 0.050” single strand programmed bead in\nit bias-ply 16” light truck tires.\n\nMilner also testified that the rim designed by Ford and manufactured by Budd was defective\nbecause its size was not clearly marked on it and because it could have been redesigned to prevent\na 16” tire from passing over its flange.\n\nThe jury found that Goodrich's conduct was the sole proximate cause of Martinez's injuries and\nthat Goodrich was grossly negligent. Furthermore, the jury found that the tire manufactured by\nGoodrich was defective, while the wheel rim designed by Ford and manufactured by Budd was\nnot defective. The jury allocated 100% of the producing cause of Martinez's injuries to the acts\nand omissions of Goodrich.\n\nThe jury awarded the Martinezes $5.5 million in actual damages and $11.5 million in punitive\ndamages. After reducing the award of actual damages by $1.4 million pursuant to a settlement\nagreement between the Martinezes, Ford, and Budd, reducing the punitive damages to the\namount of actual damages pursuant to a pretrial agreement between Goodrich and the Martinezes,\nand awarding prejudgment interest, the trial court rendered judgment for the Martinezes for\n$10,308,792.45.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the award of actual damages, holding that there was legally\nsufficient evidence to support the finding of a design defect based upon its examination of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the availability of safer design alternatives; (2) similar accidents involving\nthe same product; (3) subsequent changes or modifications in design; (4) out-of-court experiments\nindicating Goodrich's knowledge of a design defect; and (5) expert testimony claiming a design\ndefect. 928 S.W.2d at 70. The court rejected Goodrich's argument that Martinez's failure to heed\nthe product's warnings was a complete defense to the product defect claim. However, the court of\nappeals reversed and rendered the award of punitive damages, holding that there was no evidence\nto support the jury's finding of gross negligence.\n\nOnly Goodrich applied to this Court for writ of error. As in the court of appeals, Goodrich's\nprincipal argument here is that no evidence supports the jury finding that the tire was defective\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Section 402A\nstates:\n\n    *335 (1) one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the\n   user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to\n   the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\n\n   (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and\n\n   (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the\n   condition in which it is sold.\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 402A (1965). A product may be unreasonably\ndangerous because of a defect in manufacturing, design, or marketing. See Caterpillar, Inc. v.\nShears, 911 S.W.2d 379, 382 (Tex.1995); Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs, 480 S.W.2d 602, 604–\n05 (Tex.1972). To prove a design defect, a claimant must establish, among other things, that the\ndefendant could have provided a safer alternative design. See Caterpillar, 911 S.W.2d at 384 (“[I]f\nthere are no safer alternatives, a product is not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.”).\nImplicit in this holding is that the safer alternative design must be reasonable, i.e., that it can be\nimplemented without destroying the utility of the product. See id. (“ ‘Texas law does not require\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 15\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

Co., 576 F.2d 97, 101 (5th Cir.1978)). 3\n\n [4] The newly released Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability carries forward this\nfocus on reasonable alternative design. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS\nLIABILITYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY § 2(b). Section 2(b) provides:\n\n            A product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by\n            the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable\n            alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n            commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design\n            renders the product not reasonably safe.\n\nTo determine whether a reasonable alternative design exists, and if so whether its omission renders\nthe product unreasonably dangerous (or in the words of the new Restatement, not reasonably\nsafe), the finder of fact may weigh various factors bearing on the risk and utility of the product.\nSee Caterpillar, 911 S.W.2d at 383–84; Turner v. General Motors Corp., 584 S.W.2d 844,\n848 (Tex.1979). 4 One of these factors is whether the product contains suitable warnings and\ninstructions. See Turner, 584 S.W.2d at 847. The new Restatement likewise carries forward this\napproach:\n\n\n  A broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative design\n  is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably safe. The factors\n  include, among others, the magnitude and probability of the foreseeable risks of harm, the\n  instructions and warnings accompanying the product, and the nature and strength of consumer\n  expectations regarding the product, including expectations arising from product portrayal and\n  marketing.... The relative advantages and disadvantages of the product as designed and as it\n  alternatively could have been designed may also be considered. Thus, the likely effects of the\n  alternative design on production costs; the effects of the alternative design on product longevity,\n  maintenance, repair, and esthetics; and the range of consumer choice among products are factors\n  that may be taken into account....\n  RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. f (emphasis\n  added).\n[5] Goodrich urges this Court to depart from this standard by following certain language from\nComment j of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Comment j provides in part:\n\n             *336 Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be\n            read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if\n            it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The new Restatement, however,\nexpressly rejects the Comment j approach:\n\n            Reasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the\n            production and distribution of reasonably safe products. In general, when a safer\n            design can reasonably be implemented and risks can reasonably be designed out\n            of a product, adoption of the safer design is required over a warning that leaves\n            a significant residuum of such risks. For example, instructions and warnings\n            may be ineffective because users of the product may not be adequately reached,\n            may be likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the\n            instructions or heed the warnings. However, when an alternative design to avoid\n            risks cannot reasonably be implemented, adequate instructions and warnings\n            will normally be sufficient to render the product reasonably safe. Compare\n            Comment e. Warnings are not, however, a substitute for the provision of a\n            reasonably safe design.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. l (emphasis added).\nThe Reporters' Notes in the new Restatement refer to Comment j as “unfortunate language”\nthat “has elicited heavy criticism from a host of commentators.” RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF\nTORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2, Reporters' Note, cmt. l (citing Latin, Good Warnings,\nBad Products, and Cognitive Limitations, 41 U.C.L.A. L.REV. 1193 (1994) (utilizing the work of\ncognitive theorists to demonstrate that warnings should only be used as a supplement to a design\nthat already embodies reasonable safety and not as a substitute for it); Twerski, et al., The Use and\nAbuse of Warnings in Products Liability: Design Defect Comes of Age, 61 CORNELL L.REV.\n495, 506 (1976)). Similarly, this Court has indicated that the fact that a danger is open and obvious\n(and thus need not be warned against) does not preclude a finding of product defect when a safer,\nreasonable alternative design exists. See Caterpillar, 911 S.W.2d at 383. (“A number of courts are\nof the view that obvious risks are not design defects which must be remedied. (citations omitted).\nHowever, our Court has held that liability for a design defect may attach even if the defect is\napparent.”).\n\nThe drafters of the new Restatement provide the following illustration for why courts have\noverwhelmingly rejected Comment j:\n\n   Jeremy's foot was severed when caught between the blade and compaction chamber of a garbage\n   truck on which he was working. The injury occurred when he lost his balance while jumping on\n   the back step of the garbage truck as it was moving from one stop to the next.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n   warning was given does not preclude Jeremy from seeking to establish a design defect under\n   Subsection (b). The possibility that an employee might lose his balance and thus encounter the\n   shear point was a risk that a warning could not eliminate and that might require a safety guard.\n   Whether a design defect can be established is governed by Subsection (b).\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. l, illus. 14. 5 In fact,\nGoodrich recognized at trial that warnings are an imperfect means to remedy a product defect.\nIn response to a question posed by the Martinezes' attorney, Goodrich engineer Stanley Lew\nanswered:\n\n\n   Q: Is that why designs of a product are more important than warnings on a product because\n     people may not see warnings but they are always going to encounter the design?\n\n         A: Yes, that's correct. It's the products they deal with.\n\n   *337 For these reasons we refuse to adopt the approach of Comment j of the superseded\n     Restatement (Second) of Torts section 402A.\n\n\n                                                         B\n\n [6] We do not hold, as the dissenting justices claim, that “a product is defective whenever it could\nbe more safely designed without substantially impairing its utility,” post at 344, or that “warnings\nare irrelevant in determining whether a product is reasonably safe.” Post at 345. Rather, as we\nhave explained, we agree with the new Restatement that warnings and safer alternative designs\nare factors, among others, for the jury to consider in determining whether the product as designed\nis reasonably safe. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2\ncmt. f. While the dissenting justices say that they also agree with the Restatement's approach, they\nwould, at least in this case, remove the balancing process from the jury. Instead, they would hold\nthat Goodrich's warning rendered the tape bead design reasonably safe as a matter of law.\n\n[7] The dissenting justices first argue that Goodrich's warning was clear and that it could have\nbeen followed, and consequently Martinez was injured only by “[i]gnoring ... his own good sense.”\nPost at 343. Even if this were true, 6 it is precisely because “it is not at all unusual for a person\nto fail to follow basic warnings and instructions,” General Motors Corp. v. Saenz, 873 S.W.2d\n353, 358 (Tex.1993), that we have rejected the superseded Comment j. The dissent also notes that\nthere have been few reported mismatch accidents involving tires with this particular warning label.\nWhile this is certainly relevant, and perhaps would persuade many juries, we cannot say that it\nconclusively establishes that the tire is reasonably safe when weighed against the other evidence.\nThe jury heard firsthand how an accident can occur despite the warning label, and how a redesigned\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury also heard evidence that Goodrich's competitors\nhad incorporated the single strand programmed bead by the early 1980s, and that Goodrich itself\nadopted this design in 1991, a year after manufacturing the tire that injured Martinez. Under these\ncircumstances, there is at least some evidence supporting the jury's finding of product defect.\n\n\n\n                                                        III\n\n [8] Goodrich argues that even if its Comment j argument does not prevail, it is still entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law because no safer alternative was available. In response, the Martinezes\npoint to the evidence that Goodrich's competitors, and eventually Goodrich itself, adopted the safer\n0.050” single strand programmed bead. Goodrich counters that this alternative design is not in fact\nsafer because if the tire is matched to the wrong size rim the bead will never seat on the rim and\nit will inevitably explode during use.\n\nWe agree with the general proposition that a manufacturer should not be liable for failing to\nadopt an alternative design that would, under other circumstances, impose an equal or greater\nrisk of harm. To prevail in a design defect case, a plaintiff should be required to show that the\nsafety benefits from its proposed design are foreseeably greater than the resulting costs, including\nany diminished usefulness or diminished safety. See Owen, Toward a Proper Test for Design\nDefectiveness: “Micro–Balancing” Costs and Benefits, 75 TEX. L. REV. 1661, 1690 (1997). As\nthe new Restatement explains:\n\n            When evaluating the reasonableness of a design alternative, the overall safety\n            of the product must be considered. It is not sufficient that the alternative\n            design would have reduced or prevented the harm suffered by the plaintiff if it\n            would also have introduced into the product other dangers of equal or greater\n            magnitude.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. f.\n\nThe Martinezes, however, offered some evidence that their alternative design not only would\nhave prevented the injury to Martinez, but also that it would not have introduced *338 other\ndangers of equal or greater magnitude. It is undisputed that the single strand programmed bead\nis more resistant to breaking in mismatch situations. Goodrich expert Tom Conner testified that\nin a mismatch situation the tape bead may break at 60 psi, while a single strand bead will not\nbreak until at least 130 psi. Conner also testified that he has never heard of a single strand bead\nbreaking during the inflating of a mismatched tire. Goodrich representative Stanley Lew testified\nthat the single strand bead is more resistant in a mismatch situation. Lew also testified that if the\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\ntire inflated by Martinez had a single strand bead it would not have exploded. Both Conner and\nLew testified that they would prefer a tire inflated by their loved one to have a single strand bead.\n\nIt is true that Goodrich also offered some evidence that the single strand programmed bead would\nhave introduced other dangers of equal or greater magnitude because of the risk of “in service”\nblow-outs. Lew testified that even if a 16” tire was successfully mounted on a 16.5” rim, the tire\nwill fail when used on the road. Conner, a forensic scientist, also stated that both laboratory and\nroad testing revealed that if a 16” tire was mounted on a 16.5” rim the tire will blow out when\ndriven on the road. However, Conner testified that in his 25 years of experience in the tire industry\nhe has never heard of a “single person in the world” that has been hurt by a 16” tire on a 16.5” rim\n“out in service.” Lew testified on direct examination:\n\n   Q: Have you personally seen any examples of where the Goodyear programmed single strand\n     bead used in some but not all of its tires failed in service on the wrong sized wheel?\n\n   A: No; I haven't seen any.\n\nLew further testified:\n\n   Q: Tell me one person's name from any tire you have ever seen where it's failed in service when\n     a 16's mounted on a 16.5.\n\n   A: Fine and I told you at my deposition that no; I don't know a single name.\n\n   Q: All right. Tell me one single name of a persons [sic] that's been injured in a mismatch\n     explosion of a single strand bead?\n\n   A: Again, I don't know of any.\n\nThis evidence does not conclusively prove that the programmed bead would have introduced into\nthe product other dangers of equal or greater magnitude. There was thus a fact issue regarding\nwhether a reasonable alternative design existed, which the jury resolved in favor of the Martinezes.\n\n\n\n                                                        IV\n\n [9] Goodrich next asserts that the evidence conclusively establishes that the tire rim designed\nby Ford Motor Company and manufactured by the Budd Company was defective and that such\ndefect contributed to Martinez's injuries, so that the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial\ncourt's judgment based on the jury's answers that the rim was not defective and did not contribute\nto the injury. Goodrich points to Milner's undisputed testimony that the rim was defective because\nit could have been redesigned to prevent a 16” tire from passing over its flange.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex.1986) (citing Coxson v. Atlanta Life Ins. Co.,\n142 Tex. 544, 179 S.W.2d 943, 945 (1944)). See also TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (uncontroverted\nexpert testimony may establish right to summary judgment only “as to subject matter concerning\nwhich the trier of fact must be guided by the opinion testimony of experts”). Goodrich argues that\nthis subject *339 matter is for experts alone because the jury could not have determined, without\nthe benefit of expert testimony, that a safer, feasible, alternative design existed.\n\nWe agree that expert testimony was probably necessary to show the feasibility of the alternative\nrim design which would have prevented a mismatched tire from passing over the rim flange.\nOnce a feasible alternative design was shown, however, the question remained whether the rim as\ndesigned was unreasonably dangerous. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS\nLIABILITY § 2(b) (product is defective in design when risks could have been reduced by adoption\nof reasonable alternative design and omission of the alternative design renders the product not\nreasonably safe). We conclude that the jury could properly determine whether the rim as designed\nwas unreasonably dangerous, and that it was not required to follow expert testimony on this\nissue. Milner's expert testimony thus does not conclusively establish that the rim was defective.\nCf. McGalliard, 722 S.W.2d at 697 (house repairs); Broussard v. Moon, 431 S.W.2d 534, 537\n(Tex.1968) (dishwasher repairs); Coxson, 179 S.W.2d at 945 (sound health of insured at time\npolicy was issued).\n\n [11] The dissent argues that, even if the jury was not required to accept the expert testimony of rim\ndefect, it was required to accept the lay opinion of Martinez and Martinez's co-worker on this issue.\nOf course, the fact that the dissent places such weight on this lay testimony supports our conclusion\nthat the subject matter is not solely for experts. Moreover, where the subject matter is not solely\nfor experts, uncontroverted opinion testimony is not conclusive, regardless of whether it comes\nfrom an expert or a lay witness. The rule of McGalliard quoted above—that expert testimony is\ngenerally not conclusive–––follows not because the testimony is from an expert, but because it is\nopinion testimony. Unless the subject matter is solely for experts, jurors are capable of forming\ntheir own opinions from the record as a whole. See Coxson, 179 S.W.2d at 945 (expert testimony\nis conclusive only where jurors “cannot properly be assumed to have, or be able to form, correct\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nopinions of their own based upon the evidence as a whole and aided by their own experience and\nknowledge of the subject of inquiry”). Thus, the jury was entitled to reject the opinion testimony\nthat the rim was defective, regardless of whether it was from an expert, Martinez, or Martinez's\nco-worker.\n\n [12] The dissent also argues that, even without any opinion testimony, the record conclusively\nestablishes that the rim was defective. Milner testified that the rim could have been redesigned to\nprevent a 16” tire from being mounted on it, possibly by filling the wheel well so that it was not\nas deep. However, while this is some evidence of a feasible alternative design, it is not conclusive\nevidence of an unreasonably dangerous product, given the factors that a jury must balance under\nthe Restatement. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt.\nf. For example, there was no evidence of whether the alternative design would affect production\ncosts, the rim's road characteristics, or the relative ease of mounting and dismounting the correct\nsize tire.\n\nThe dissent also argues that the rim is defective as a matter of law because its size was not\nprominently marked on it. Milner and Conner both testified that the rim's size should be displayed\nclose to the valve stem to reduce the risk of an accidental mismatch. Milner further testified that\nthe size should also be displayed in the wheel well, as some other manufacturers had done. Milner\npointed out, however, that “this wheel's probably been cleaned since [the accident] so that the\nexistence of [a size marking] wouldn't necessarily mean that [Martinez] would see it.” Indeed,\nMartinez's co-worker testified that at the time of the accident the wheel was so covered with\ncaliche that “it looked white.” Based on this evidence, the jury could have concluded that a size\nmarking near the valve stem would have been obscured, and would not have been seen by Martinez.\nSimilarly, the jury was entitled to conclude that Martinez would not have seen a size marking or\nwarning in the well of the wheel while he was in the process of mounting a tire on the wheel. Thus,\neven if the dissent were correct that the rim was defective as a matter of law because its size was\nnot clearly marked, *340 the evidence does not conclusively establish that any such defect was\na producing cause of Martinez's injury. Because the issues of rim defect and producing causation\nwere both submitted to the jury in one broad-form question, the jury's negative answer to that\nquestion is not contrary to the conclusive evidence.\n\n\n\n                                                         V\n\nGoodrich also argues that the evidence conclusively establishes that Martinez was negligent and\nthat he contributed to his own injuries. Specifically, Goodrich argues that unless some defect in\nthe warning hinders a plaintiff's ability to see and heed it, the failure to see and heed a warning\nis conclusive proof of contributory negligence.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n [13] [14] In reviewing a conclusive evidence point, we must determine whether the proffered\nevidence as a whole rises to a level that reasonable people could not differ in their conclusions.\nTransportation Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 25 (Tex.1994); Powers & Ratliff, Another Look\nat “No Evidence” and “Insufficient Evidence,” 69 TEX. L.REV. 515, 523 (1991) ( “Ultimately,\nthe test for ‘conclusive evidence’ ... is similar to the test for ‘no evidence’ ...; the court asks\nwhether reasonable minds could differ about the fact determination to be made by the jury.”).\nThe jury was asked to decide whether Martinez was negligent, that is, whether he failed to\nexercise ordinary prudence. Both Martinez and his co-worker Ramundo Regalado testified that,\nbecause they had removed 16” tires from the rims on which they were working, they assumed\nthat the rims were also 16”. Also, although there was a tire-changing machine on the premises,\nthe evidence was conflicting as to whether Martinez could have used it to secure the tire.\nRene Vera, Martinez and Regalado's employer, testified that the tire-changing machine, although\ninoperable for dismounting tires, could have nonetheless been used to secure the tire during\ninflation. Regalado testified, however, that the tire-changing machine did not work, despite his\nrepeated requests to the safety foreman to have it repaired, and that had it worked he and Martinez\nwould have been using it on the day of the accident to secure the tire. Thus, Goodrich failed to\nconclusively prove that Martinez was negligent in failing to use the machine. There is no evidence\nthat the other safety devices referenced in the tire warning—a safety cage or an extension hose—\nwere available to Martinez. Further, Goodrich offered no evidence as to whether it was practical or\nfeasible under the circumstances for Martinez to bolt the rim to a vehicle axle in order to inflate the\ntire and seat the bead. Both Martinez and Regalado testified that the manner in which Martinez was\ninflating the tire was customary in their shop. Based upon this evidence, we cannot conclude that\nreasonable people could not differ about whether Martinez failed to exercise ordinary prudence\nunder the circumstances.\n\nBecause we conclude that Goodrich did not conclusively establish that Martinez was negligent,\nwe do not address Goodrich's argument that there is no evidence to support the jury's allocation\nof causation.\n\n\n\n                                                        VI\n\n [15] Goodrich next argues that even if it is not entitled to a rendition of judgment, it is entitled to\na new trial because of three reversible evidentiary rulings. These rulings were: (1) the admission\nof evidence of thirty-four other lawsuits against Goodrich involving mismatched tires; (2) the\nadmission of evidence that Goodrich had subsequently redesigned its radial light truck tires to\nincorporate the single strand programmed bead; and (3) the admission of a “time line” used by\nthe Martinezes' expert. To reverse a judgment based upon erroneously admitted evidence, the\ncomplaining party must show that the error was reasonably calculated to cause and probably did\ncause rendition of an improper judgment or was such that it prevented the complaining party from\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nmaking a proper presentation of the case to the appellate court. See Texas Dep't of Human Servs.\nv. White, 817 S.W.2d 62, 63 (Tex.1991); Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.2d 394, 396\n(Tex.1989); TEX.R.APP. P. 61.1.\n\n [16] First, as to the other lawsuits, Goodrich asserts that thirty-three of these thirty-four lawsuits\ninvolved tires without pictographic warnings. Therefore, they were not *341 substantially similar\nand were admitted without proper predicate. Evidence of earlier accidents that occurred under\nreasonably similar but not necessarily identical circumstances is admissible. Missouri–Kansas–\nTexas R. Co. v. May, 600 S.W.2d 755, 756 (Tex.1980); Missouri Pac. R.R. v. Cooper, 563 S.W.2d\n233, 236 (Tex.1978); see also Jackson v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 788 F.2d 1070 (5th\nCir.1986) (applying Texas law). Like this case, the earlier accidents resulted from mounting a 16”\nGoodrich tire with a tape bead on a 16.5” rim. The absence of pictographic warnings on the tires\ndoes not render the accidents so dissimilar as to preclude their admission, but merely goes to the\nweight of the evidence. The trial court did not commit error by admitting evidence of the thirty-\nfour earlier accidents caused by mismatching Goodrich tires. 7\n\n [17] Goodrich next complains that the trial court erred by admitting evidence that Goodrich\nsubsequently redesigned its radial light truck tires to incorporate the single strand programmed\nbead, because radial tires are fundamentally different from the bias-ply tire that injured Martinez,\nand the bead change was not made in the radial tires for safety reasons. Goodrich first argues\nthat, under these circumstances, the evidence regarding radial tires violates Texas Rule of Civil\nEvidence 407(a).\n\nRule 407(a) states:\n\n            Subsequent Remedial Measures. When, after an event, measures are taken\n            which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur,\n            evidence of the subsequent remedial measures is not admissible to prove\n            negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. This rule does\n            not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures when\n            offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control or feasibility of\n            precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment. Nothing in this rule\n            shall preclude admissibility in products liability cases based on strict liability.\n\nTEX.R. CIV. EVID. 407(a) (emphasis added). Goodrich argues that this rule only permits the\nadmission of subsequent remedial measures involving the product at issue, and that such measures\nmust have been made for safety reasons. However, the rule does not contain these limitations.\nRather, under the express language emphasized above, Rule 407(a) simply does not apply in\nproducts liability cases based on strict liability. Thus, the trial court did not violate Rule 407(a). 8\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    24\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n [18] Goodrich further argues that, because of the differences between radial tires and bias-ply\ntires, the evidence regarding the redesign of its radial tires is not relevant to the issue of design\ndefect in its bias-ply tires. Goodrich appears to argue that it was harmed by this evidence because\nthe jury could have improperly inferred that, because Goodrich incorporated the single strand\nprogrammed bead into its radial tires, such redesign was feasible and necessary for the bias-ply\ntire involved in this accident. However, there was independent evidence that the single strand\nprogrammed bead was feasible for bias-ply tires as early as 1982, when General Tire adopted that\ndesign, and that the programmed bead was safer. Under these circumstances, the trial court did\nnot commit reversible error by admitting *342 evidence of Goodrich's redesign of its radial tires.\n\nRaising similar arguments, Goodrich also contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence\nof Goodrich's redesign of its “space saver” spare tires. For the reasons discussed above regarding\nthe radial tires, the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting this evidence.\n\nGoodrich's final evidentiary complaint is that the trial court committed reversible error by\nadmitting a “time line” chart prepared by the Martinezes' expert and used by him during trial.\nSpecifically, Goodrich complains that the time line contained a self-serving compilation of hearsay\nevidence both irrelevant to the issues in this lawsuit and unfairly prejudicial to Goodrich.\n\n [19] [20] Charts and diagrams that summarize, or perhaps emphasize, testimony are admissible\nif the underlying information has been admitted into evidence, or is subsequently admitted\ninto evidence. See Speier v. Webster College, 616 S.W.2d 617, 618–19 (Tex.1981); Cooper\nPetroleum Co. v. LaGloria Oil & Gas Co., 436 S.W.2d 889, 891 (Tex.1969); Champlin Oil &\nRef. Co. v. Chastain, 403 S.W.2d 376, 389 (Tex.1965). In this case, Goodrich complains that the\nchart contained highly prejudicial hearsay evidence such as one line reading “numerous 16/16.5\nmismatch explosions resulting in serious injury or death.” However, all the evidence contained on\nthe chart was already in evidence, principally through Milner's testimony, and Goodrich did not\nobject to its introduction. The trial court did not err by admitting the time line.\n\n\n\n                                                        VII\n\n [21] Finally, Goodrich complains that the trial court committed reversible error by not bifurcating\nthe liability and punitive damages phases of the trial as required by this Court's subsequent decision\nin Transportation Insurance Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10 (Tex.1994). The Martinezes argue\nthat consideration of this point is unnecessary because the court of appeals reversed and rendered\nthe jury's punitive damage award, holding there was no evidence to support the verdict on those\ndamages. However, in Moriel we instructed trial courts to bifurcate the liability and punitive\ndamages phases of the trial because certain evidence admissible solely for the purpose of proving\npunitive damages “has a very real potential for prejudicing the jury's determination of other\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                25\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\ndisputed issues in a tort case.” Id. at 30. Thus, we must determine whether the trial court erred\nin refusing to bifurcate the punitive damages phase of the trial, and if so, whether the error was\nharmful.\n\nIn Moriel we held that “a trial court, if presented with a timely motion, should bifurcate the\ndetermination of the amount of punitive damages from the remaining issues.” Id. at 30. We stated\nfurther that bifurcation applies “to all punitive damages cases tried in the future.” Id. at 26. Shortly\nthereafter, in Ellis County State Bank v. Keever, 888 S.W.2d 790 (Tex.1994), we applied Moriel\nretroactively. In Keever, we stated that “[a]lthough Moriel was decided after the court of appeals'\ndecision in this case, its holding should be applied to a pending case in which a party has preserved\nthe complaint that the court of appeals failed to properly scrutinize a punitive damage award.” Id.\nat 799. Since Goodrich presented the trial court with a timely motion, the trial court, consistent\nwith our ruling in Keever, should have bifurcated the determination of the amount of punitive\ndamages from the remaining issues.\n\nHaving determined that the trial court erred in refusing to bifurcate the trial, we must determine\nwhether the trial court's error was reasonably calculated to cause and probably did cause rendition\nof an improper judgment. See TEX.R.APP. P. 61.1 The rationale given for bifurcation in Moriel\nwas that “evidence of a defendant's net worth, which is generally relevant only to the amount of\npunitive damages, by highlighting the relative wealth of a defendant, has a very real potential for\nprejudicing the jury's determination of other disputed issues in a tort case.” Moriel, 879 S.W.2d\nat 30. Here, the jury was not presented with any evidence of Goodrich's net worth. While we\ndo not hold that net worth evidence is the only prejudice that may result from trying actual and\npunitive *343 damage claims together, there is no prejudice in this case requiring a reversal of\nthe judgment. Goodrich argues that the Martinezes were free to indulge in inflammatory argument\nfor a high punitive damage award that would not have been permitted in the liability phase had\nbifurcation been granted. Specifically, Goodrich argues that it was severely prejudiced by the\nMartinezes' plea for $500,000 for each of the thirty-four other lawsuits filed against Goodrich so\nas to send a “message back to Akron.” Because the other suits were properly in evidence on the\nissue of liability, however, we conclude that this jury argument was not so prejudicial to the actual\ndamages claim as to require a reversal.\n\n\n\n                                                       ***\n\nBecause we conclude that there is some evidence to support the judgment of the court below on\nthe theory of products liability, we need not consider Goodrich's claim that there is no evidence\nas to negligence. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\nHECHT, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which ENOCH and BAKER, JJ., join, and in which\nOWEN, J., joins in all but Part II.\n\n\nHECHT, Justice, joined by ENOCH and BAKER, Justices, and by OWEN, Justice, in all but Part\nII, dissenting.\nThe Court's revision of its opinion on rehearing requires a responsive revision in this dissent. The\ndissenting opinion issued July 3, 1998 is accordingly withdrawn, and this opinion substituted.\n\nHaving changed about a thousand tires in his life, Roberto Martinez admits he knew better than to\nlean over a tire while inflating it. Besides, he had seen the pictographic warning on the very tire\nhe was changing which showed a worker being hurt by an exploding tire and warned: “NEVER\nstand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.” Ignoring this warning and his own good\nsense, Martinez was leaning over the tire, inflating it, when it exploded in his face.\n\nThe 16” tire exploded because it would not fit the 16.5” wheel on which Martinez was trying to\nmount it. Martinez knew it was very dangerous to try to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” wheel, and he\nwould never knowingly have tried to do it, but the size of the wheel was not marked where he could\nfind it. He understood that his co-worker had taken a 16” tire off the wheel, and he was simply\ntrying to put the same size tire back on. The Budd Company, which manufactured the wheel to\nFord Motor Company's specifications, knew, as did Ford, that people sometimes try to mount 16”\ntires on 16.5” wheels, not realizing that tire and wheel are mismatched. To minimize the risk of\nsuch mistakes, Budd and Ford could have changed the design of the wheel to prevent mounting\nmismatched tires, but they did not do so. Budd could also have simply stamped the size in plain\nview on the outboard side of the wheel near the valve stem where it was almost sure to be seen, but\nit did not do that, either. Instead it encoded the size in small letters on the inboard side, where it was\nhard to find if the wheel was clean, and indecipherable if the wheel was dirty, as it was in this case.\n\nAlthough a 16.5” wheel can be designed so that a 16” tire cannot be mounted on it, a 16” tire cannot\nbe designed so that it cannot be mounted on a 16.5” wheel. A tire manufacturer's only options\nto reduce the risk of injury from attempting to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” wheel are to place a\nwarning on the tire or to design the bead wire so that it will withstand higher inflation pressure\nbefore exploding. The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, which made the tire Martinez was using,\nchose to put a prominent, pictographic label on it, which, as I have said, Martinez actually saw but\ndid not heed. Had he done so, he would not have been injured. In fact, according to the record,\nonly one other person has ever claimed to have been injured attempting to mount a 16” tire with a\nwarning label like Goodrich's on a 16.5” wheel, although thousands of labeled tires and more than\nthirty million 16.5” wheels have been manufactured in the past two decades.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nNow as among Martinez, the wheel manufacturers, and Goodrich, how should responsibility *344\nfor Martinez's accident be apportioned? The reader may be surprised at the answer in this case.\nMartinez, though negligent by his own admission, is held to bear no responsibility for the accident.\nThe wheel manufacturers, too, are held to be free of responsibility (they settled with Martinez\nbefore trial) although the undisputed testimony by both Martinez's and Goodrich's experts is that\nBudd and Ford defectively designed the wheel. Only Goodrich is held liable—and for providing a\nwarning on the tire that would have prevented Martinez's accident altogether instead of redesigning\nthe bead wire so that the accident would only have been less likely. This aberrant result flows from\nfour serious flaws in the Court's opinion which, even more importantly, misstate the law that will\nbe applied in other cases.\n\nFirst, the Court holds that a product can be found to be defective whenever it could be more safely\ndesigned without substantially impairing its utility. This is not, and should not be, the law. As\nthe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability advises, a “broad range of factors” besides\nthe utility of a reasonable alternate design should be considered in determining whether its use\nis necessary to keep the product reasonably safe, including “the magnitude and probability of the\nforeseeable risks of harm [and] the instructions and warnings accompanying the product”. 1 When\nthe undisputed evidence is that the magnitude and probability of a risk are low, an alternative\ndesign could reduce but not eliminate that risk, and the instructions and warnings given do\neliminate the risk, the product should be determined not to be defective as a matter of law.\n\nSecond, the Court holds that whether a wheel is defectively designed “because its size is not clearly\nmarked or because its design allows a mismatched tire to be placed on it” can be decided by “lay\njurors, based on their own experience and common sense,” unaided by expert opinion. 2 It follows\nthat a plaintiff, by offering no evidence other than his own lay opinion, could prove that a wheel\nwas defectively designed—that is, that risks of harm were foreseeable, that there was a reasonable\nalternative design that would reduce and avoid them, and that the omission of the design rendered\nthe product not reasonably safe. I doubt whether such lay testimony would support a judgment\nin any design defect case. 3 The record in this case proves that such evidence could not possibly\nsupport a judgment for Martinez.\n\nThird, the Court holds that evidence of thirty-four other claims of injury over fifteen years from\ntrying to mount 16” Goodrich tires on 16.5” wheels was admissible without proof that any of the\nclaims were valid—some were undisputedly invalid—or that they arose out of accidents similar to\nMartinez's. A few weeks ago the Court held that evidence of anticipated or unpaid punitive damage\nclaims is irrelevant and inadmissible to show punitive damage liability. 4 Today the Court holds\nthat evidence of other claims—whether proven or not, and whether similar or not—is relevant and\nadmissible to show liability. The Court also holds that an expert may testify that a product has\ncaused serious injury and death when no basis at all has been shown for the statement.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\nFourth, the Court holds that the district court's refusal to bifurcate the punitive damages part of\nthe trial was harmless error because Martinez did not offer evidence of Goodrich's net worth.\nBut while net worth evidence can unfairly prejudice the jury's consideration of liability issues,\nit is not the sole source of prejudice. Today's opinion undermines the bifurcation requirement of\nTransportation Insurance Co. v. Moriel. 5\n\nBecause I disagree with all these holdings, for reasons I now explain in more detail, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n\n                                                      *345 I\n\nComment j to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts states:\n\n            Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read\n            and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is\n            followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. 6\n\nWe have followed the first clause of comment j, but only to the extent of holding that a plaintiff\nis entitled to a rebuttable presumption that had he been adequately warned of the dangers of a\nproduct, he would have avoided injury, despite the fact that experience teaches that “it is not at\nall unusual for a person to fail to follow basic warnings and instructions.” 7 The presumption is\nmerely a procedural device to obviate the necessity of plaintiff's self-serving testimony that he\nwould have heeded adequate warnings. 8 In making the presumption rebuttable we recognized that\nthe first clause is not always true. Further, we have never followed the second clause of comment j,\nand now the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability has withdrawn comment j altogether\nas “unfortunate language” that “has elicited heavy criticism from a host of commentators.” 9 The\nCourt's firm rejection of comment j, which the Court has never adopted and the Restatement has\nnow itself rejected, is perhaps beating a dead horse, but I agree that comment j does not correctly\nstate what the law is or should be.\n\nSince it is human nature to disregard instructions, a rule that any product is reasonably safe as\nlong as it bears an adequate warning of the risks of its use is not feasible. Such behavior, however,\ndoes not warrant the opposite rule that warnings are irrelevant in determining whether a product\nis reasonably safe. I agree with the Court that comment l to Section 2 of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts: Products Liability now has it about right:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                29\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n            Reasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the\n            production and distribution of reasonably safe products. In general, when a safer\n            design can reasonably be implemented and risks can reasonably be designed out\n            of a product, adoption of the safer design is required over a warning that leaves\n            a significant residuum of such risks. For example, instructions and warnings\n            may be ineffective because users of the product may not be adequately reached,\n            may be likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the\n            instructions or heed the warnings. However, when an alternative design to avoid\n            risks cannot reasonably be implemented, adequate instructions and warnings\n            will normally be sufficient to render the product reasonably safe. Warnings are\n            not, however, a substitute for the provision of a reasonably safe design. 10\n\nI do not agree, however, that the Court correctly reads or follows comment l. Comment l limits\nbut does not foreclose the role of warnings in making products reasonably safe, even when there\nis a safer alternative design. The Court stresses the last sentence of comment l and brushes past\nthe first sentence. Taken as a whole, the comment says, correctly, I think, that a safer alternative\ndesign that eliminates a risk is required over a warning that leaves a significant residuum of risk\nbecause product users may not get the warning, may be inattentive, or may not be motivated to\nheed the warning. The illustration accompanying comment l is of a worker whose foot is severed\nby a garbage truck's blade and compaction chamber when he loses his balance jumping onto the\nback of the truck. 11 A warning on the truck, “keep hands and feet away”, does little to protect\n *346 against a worker's foreseeable inadvertence or misstep in the usual discharge of his job.\nBut the warning might well be adequate admonishment to the merely curious, even if the garbage\ntruck could be designed to be safer, if the residuum of risk were insignificant. Even if the risk\nthat a worker will lose his balance and slip is significant enough to warrant designing additional\nprotections in the truck, the risk that someone will intentionally stick his hand in a place where it\nobviously may be hurt when he is effectively warned not to do so may not warrant design changes.\n\nSection 2(b) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability states the applicable rule:\n\n            A product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by\n            the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable\n            alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n            commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design\n            renders the product not reasonably safe. 12\n\nThere are two components to this rule: the possibility of a safer, reasonable alternative design, and\na product that is not reasonably safe without that design. Both are required. Even if a reasonable\nalternative design would make a product safer, the product is not defective unless the omission of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  30\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nthe design makes the product not reasonably safe. The comparison is not between the two designs,\nbut between the product alternatively designed and the product including any warning. Comment\nf to Section 2 explains:\n\n            Subsection (b) states that a product is defective in design if the omission of\n            a reasonable alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe. A\n            broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative\n            design is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably\n            safe. The factors include, among others, the magnitude and probability of the\n            foreseeable risks of harm, the instructions and warnings accompanying the\n            product, and the nature and strength of consumer expectations regarding the\n            product, including expectations arising from product portrayal and marketing.\n            The relative advantages and disadvantages of the product as designed and as it\n            alternatively could have been designed may also be considered. 13\n\nThe Reporters' Note gives an example of how factors other than a safer alternative design affect\nthe determination whether a product is defective:\n\n            Comment f lists among the factors a court may consider in determining\n            whether an alternative design is reasonable and whether its omission renders\n            a product not reasonably safe the following: (1) magnitude and probability of\n            the foreseeable risks of harm; (2) the instructions and warnings accompanying\n            the product; and (3) the nature and strength of consumer expectations. A recent\n            California case is in agreement. In Hansen v. Sunnyside Products, Inc., 55\n            Cal.App.4th 1497, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 266 (1997), the court held that in a claim\n            alleging defective design of a household cleaner containing hydrofluoric acid,\n            the availability of an alternative safer design was not dispositive of liability. The\n            factfinder could consider the warnings on the bottle describing the danger of\n            exposing a user's skin to the cleaner in risk-utility balancing to decide whether\n            the product was unreasonably dangerous. 14\n\nHansen explained its rationale as follows:\n\n            We do not think that the risk to the consumer of the design of many household\n            products can be rationally evaluated without considering the product's warnings.\n            Thus, for example, what is the risk of the design of a power saw, or other power\n            tools or equipment, without considering the product's directions and warnings?\n            We dare say that the risk would be astronomically, and irrationally, high. The\n            same could be said about common garden pesticides, or even the household\n            microwave oven. In our view, were we to ask *347 jurors to evaluate the risks\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n            of the design of many household products without considering their directions\n            or warnings, the practical result would be the withdrawal from the market of\n            many useful products that are dangerous in the abstract but safe when used as\n            directed. 15\n\nAnother example the Hansen court might have picked is aerosol cans. Such cans are not defective\nmerely because they could be redesigned so as not to explode if punctured or incinerated. A\nwarning against such misuse ought to be sufficient.\n\nThe Court protests that it has not disregarded the effect of warnings in determining whether the\npossibility of a safer alternative design makes a product defective but has merely left the matter to\nthe jury. But the question remains: can any product be shown not to be defective as a matter of law\nif a reasonable alternative design could have avoided plaintiff's injury? The Court suggests no such\npossibility. The Restatement appears to contemplate that a product is not defective as a matter of\nlaw if the safer design does not eliminate the risks, or if the warning on the product does not leave\na significant residuum of risk, as when “users of the product may not be adequately reached, may\nbe likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the instructions or heed the\nwarnings.” 16 The present case illustrates this rule. Concededly, the evidence favorable to Martinez\nshows that the Goodrich tire's bead wire can be redesigned, mostly to increase its strength, without\nsignificantly reducing the tire's utility or increasing the danger of blowouts at highway speeds.\nSuch an alternative design is thus reasonable and safer. But it only reduces—it does not eliminate\n—the risk that a tire being mounted on a mismatched wheel will explode. The undisputed evidence\nin this case is that a 16” tire cannot be mounted on a 16.5” wheel, and that if the tire continues to be\ninflated in an effort to force it to seat on the wheel rim, it will explode. Redesigning the bead wire\nonly means that the tire will withstand higher inflation pressure before exploding. Although there\nwas evidence that the alternate design would prevent the tire from exploding at ordinary mounting\npressures, nothing about the design precludes the person mounting the tire from continuing to\nincrease the pressure in an effort to force it to seat on the rim. Because the risk of explosion cannot\nbe eliminated, omission of the alternative design may not make the tire not reasonably safe under\ncomment l of the Restatement.\n\nNor was Goodrich's warning ineffective, another factor under comment l. Goodrich's warning label\nshowed a picture of a person being injured by an exploding tire and stated in bright colors:\n\n\n\n                                                  DANGER\n\n   NEVER MOUNT A 16”\n\n      SIZE DIAMETER TIRE\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n      ON A 16.5” RIM.\n\n      Mounting a 16” tire on a 16.5” rim can cause severe injury or death. While it is possible to\n      pass a 16” diameter tire over the lip or flange of a 16.5” size diameter rim, it cannot position\n      itself against the rim flange. If an attempt is made to seat the bead by inflating the tire, the\n      tire bead will break with explosive force.\n\n      ...\n\n      NEVER inflate a tire which is lying on the floor or other flat surface. Always use a tire\n      mounting machine with a hold-down device or safety cage or bolt to vehicle axle.\n\n      NEVER inflate to seat beads without using an extension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck.\n\n      NEVER stand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.\n\n      ...\n\n      Failure to comply with these safety precautions can cause the bead to break and the assembly\n      to burst with sufficient force to cause serious injury or death.\n\n   Martinez does not question the adequacy of the warning. It cautions not only against\n   mismatching tires and wheels but against *348 inflating tires in certain ways under any\n   circumstances. The record in this case does not show that a warning against mismatching tires\n   and wheels will not reach users. On the contrary, Martinez testified that he saw the warning\n   on the tire, and anyway, he knew that it would be very dangerous to try to mount a 16” tire\n   on a 16.5” wheel. As Martinez put it, “common sense also tells you that where you have a\n   mismatch you can get injured.” Martinez was not inattentive, as the garbage truck worker who\n   lost his balance. He knew better than to lean over a tire—any tire—while inflating it. None of\n   the reasons in comment l that warnings may be ineffective apply in this case.\nNor were the warnings impractical. Despite the fact that Martinez was not provided with any of\nthe safety devices prescribed in the warning—a workable tire mounting machine, a cage, or an\nextension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck—and may not have been able to bolt the wheel back\non the trailer from which it had been removed before mounting the tire, he could have avoided\ninjury by simply not leaning over the tire while inflating it. Martinez testified as follows:\n\n   Q Now, I believe you have also testified, Roberto, that while you are inflating a tire you would\n   not want to be leaning over the tire as you inflate it.\n\n   A No.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n   Q And by that I mean when you are airing it up during the mounting process you would want\n   to lean away from it; would you not?\n\n   A Well, just don't get over it, you know, just be right beside it.\n\n   Q Why would you not want to be leaning over it?\n\n   A Because that's the way I was caught.\n\n   Q Okay. Do you feel it would be a safety consideration, to be safer to not be over the tire—\n\n   A Yes.\n\n   Q —while you're inflating it?\n\n   A Yes.\n\nThe inboard side of the tire, next to the ground, exploded. Martinez was injured when the wheel\nstruck his head. The wheel also struck the roof of the shop overhead and dented it. Clearly, had\nMartinez not been leaning over the wheel, as he knew not to do and as the tire label warned against,\nthe tire would not have struck his head.\n\nGiven the ease with which injury can be avoided, there is no evidence that redesigning the bead\nwire will eliminate a “significant residuum of risk” in the tire as designed with the warning label.\nIn fact, Martinez's own evidence is to the contrary. The record establishes that there has been only\none other claimed injury caused by attempting to mount a 16” tire with a warning label on a 16.5”\nwheel. The record does not reflect whether that claim was ever proved. Thousands of 16” tires\nhave been manufactured with warning labels; millions of 16.5” wheels have been manufactured\nwithout warning labels. Martinez's evidence (which should not have been admitted) shows thirty-\nfour claims against Goodrich for injuries caused by mismatching unlabeled 16” tires on 16.5”\nwheels. There has been one other claim involving a labeled tire. The tire industry should not be\ncompelled to redesign bead wires to make tires harder to explode—or pay damages for failing to\ndo so—simply because one or perhaps two mechanics over the years failed to follow directions\nor their own good sense.\n\n            From a fairness perspective, requiring individual users and consumers to bear\n            appropriate responsibility for proper product use prevents careless users and\n            consumers from being subsidized by more careful users and consumers, when\n            the former are paid damages out of funds to which the latter are forced to\n            contribute through higher product prices. 17\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nThus, under comment l, there is no evidence that omission of the safer bead wire design made\nGoodrich's tire not reasonably safe. The risk of explosion could not be eliminated, the warning was\nclear, effective, and easy to follow, and thus no significant residuum of risk remained in the tire\nas designed with the warning label attached. In the Court's view, a product manufacturer *349\nmay be liable for failing to make any feasible design change that does not significantly impair a\nproduct's utility, if only to prevent rare mishaps from conscious disregard of adequate warnings.\nThat is all the evidence in this case shows. The Court appropriately rejects one extreme position\n—comment j to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts—but then adopts the opposite\nand equally extreme position. In so doing, the Court swings toward strict liability.\n\n\n\n                                                         II\n\nThe evidence is undisputed that the wheel was defectively designed, and that the defect helped\ncause the accident. Martinez's expert testified:\n\n   Q And in your opinion the Budd wheel, Exhibit 2, is defective.\n\n   A Yes, sir.\n\n   Q And it was a cause of the accident.\n\n   A Yes, one of the causes.\n\nMartinez's expert explained that a 16.5” wheel can be designed to prevent mounting a 16” tire,\nbut that the tire cannot be designed to prevent attempts to mount it on the wheel. Moreover, the\nexpert explained that stamping the size on the wheel in plain sight, as some wheel manufacturers\ndo, would reduce the risk of mismatching. Martinez acknowledged that it “makes sense” that the\nsize of the wheel be stamped on the outboard side near the valve stem where it can easily be seen.\nMartinez's co-worker also testified:\n\n   Q If when you were working with this wheel you had seen the number 16.5 you wouldn't have\n   proceeded, would you?\n\n   A No, sir.\n\n   Q You knew based on your experience that you do not mix different sizes?\n\n   A No.\n\n   Q That's something every mechanic knows?\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n   A Yes, sir.\n\n   Q If the wheel that you were working on had the warning ..., “To avoid personal injury during\n   mounting of tire to wheel mount only 16.5 inch diameter tire,” you would not have proceeded\n   because that would have told you that the wheel really was 16.5?\n\n   A Yes, sir.\n\nThe undisputed evidence is that Budd and Ford did not design their wheel to prevent 16” tires\nfrom being mounted on it, and did not stamp the size where it could be seen. Rather, the size was\nincluded in a string of numbers stamped on the inboard side of the tire that were hard to find and\nharder to decipher. The wheel Martinez was working on was so covered by caliche that it would\nhave been virtually impossible to find the tire size.\n\nGoodrich argues that the evidence conclusively establishes that the wheel rim was defectively\ndesigned and that the defective design was a cause of Martinez's injuries. The Court rejects this\nargument, using the rule that “opinion testimony, even when uncontroverted, does not bind the jury\nunless the subject matter is one for experts alone”. 18 The Court concedes that “expert testimony\nwas probably necessary to show the feasibility of the alternative rim design which would have\nprevented a mismatched tire from passing over the rim flange.” 19 Thus, in the Court's view,\nwith which I agree, the evidence establishes one component of defective design—the possibility\nof a safer, reasonable alternative rim design. 20 The second component—that the rim was not\nreasonably safe without the alternative design 21 —is not in this context, according to the Court, a\nmatter for experts alone. Thus, the Court concludes, the evidence does not conclusively establish\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed. But the Court's conclusion does not follow from its\npremise. That is, even if the jury was free to disregard expert testimony that the wheel rim was\nunreasonably dangerous as designed, including the testimony on Martinez's own expert, because\nthe subject was not one for experts alone, the *350 matter may nevertheless be conclusively\nestablished by the evidence.\n\nAs a general rule, the testimony of a party or a witness who has an interest in the outcome of a\nsuit cannot conclusively establish a matter but raises an issue of credibility on which the jury must\npass. 22 But there are exceptions. Even summary judgment can be granted on “uncontroverted\ntestimonial evidence of an interested witness ... if the evidence is clear, positive and direct,\notherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily\ncontroverted.” 23 As we explained in Collora v. Navarro:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                36\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n   First, the general rule governing the finality to be given to testimony of an interested witness\n   is by no means an absolute one to be applied in a cut-and-dried fashion. Rather, it is flexible\n   and its application must turn on the facts of each case. Certainly there will be cases where\n   the credibility of an interested witness or party is so suspect that it must go to the jury, even\n   though the testimony is uncontradicted. Then there will also be cases where the testimony of the\n   witness is so clear that the jury should not be allowed to speculate as to his veracity. Between\n   these two extremes lies a broad spectrum of possibilities. Our courts have recognized this in the\n   past by setting forth certain standards by which the rule and its exceptions are to be measured:\n   Is the testimony clear, direct, and positive? Is it internally consistent? Is it contradicted or\n   corroborated by other witnesses? Does the opposing party possess the means to verify or dispute\n   the testimony? Does he have a way to test the witness' credibility? Obviously no one factor\n   automatically can be dispositive in every case. 24\nCollora was a suit for partition of real property in which plaintiff claimed an interest as defendant's\ncommon law wife. Plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had agreed to be husband and wife\n—one of the elements of a common law marriage—and the evidence conclusively established the\nother elements. Defendant did not testify or offer evidence in rebuttal. The trial court directed a\nverdict for the plaintiff, based on her uncontradicted testimony. The court of civil appeals reversed,\nholding that the plaintiff's testimony did not conclusively establish the existence of an agreement\nto be husband and wife because the jury could have chosen not to believe her, and thus reasonable\nminds could differ over the conclusions to be drawn from her testimony. 25 This Court reversed\nthe court of civil appeals, holding that the directed verdict was proper.\n\nThe testimony of Martinez and his co-worker, as well as Martinez's expert witness, that the\nwheel rim was unreasonably dangerous was contrary to Martinez's interest in the case. It was\nto Martinez's benefit that the percentage responsibility for causing his injuries assigned to the\nwheel manufacturers be as low as possible, since he had already settled with them. Testimony\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed undercut Martinez's position that Goodrich alone was\nresponsible. Because there was nothing to cast suspicion on Martinez's testimony or that of his co-\nworker and his expert witness concerning whether the wheel rim was unreasonably dangerous as\ndesigned, the jury was bound by that testimony. Their testimony, contrary to Martinez's interest,\nwas more like testimony by a disinterested witness. Professors William Powers, Jr. and Jack Ratliff\nhave explained the considerations for determining whether a disinterested witness's testimony is\nbinding on the jury:\n\n            Must the jury accept [the uncontradicted testimony by a disinterested witness]?\n            That is, does such testimony, if uncontradicted, [conclusively establish a fact]?\n            The prevailing and better view is that the reasonable minds test should apply\n            here. If there is nothing to cast suspicion on the testimony—that is, if reasonable\n            minds could not differ—then the jury must accept *351 it. But, if the testimony\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  37\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\n            is impeached, inconsistent, or otherwise suspect (even though not directly\n            controverted)—that is, if reasonable minds might or might not accept it—then\n            the jury may reject it. McDonald aptly observes that disinterested testimony is, in\n            fact, treated much the same as interested testimony, except that courts are more\n            inclined in the case of interested testimony to find suspicious circumstances that\n            would allow the jury to reject it. 26\n\nEven without the testimony of Martinez, his co-worker, and his expert, the record establishes\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed. As already noted, the factors to be considered in\ndetermining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous include the magnitude and probability\nof the foreseeable risks of harm, the instructions and warnings accompanying the product, the\nnature and strength of consumer expectations regarding the product, and the relative advantages\nand disadvantages of the product as designed and as it alternatively could have been designed. 27\nConcerning these factors: the risk of injury from mismounting a tire was the same for the\ndefectively designed wheel rim as for the defectively designed tire; the wheel bore no warnings, as\nthe tire did; consumer expectations were no different for the wheel than for the tire; and there was\nno evidence that the wheel rim design was advantageous or the alternate design disadvantageous.\nIn sum, the evidence established that the tire was less dangerous than the wheel rim, because the\ntire at least had a warning label and the wheel had none.\n\nThe Court states that Martinez's expert's testimony that the wheel was defective was not evidence\nthat it was unreasonably dangerous. But the expert was directed by Martinez's counsel to assume\nthat “defect is defined by the Court as being unreasonably dangerous.” The Court states that the\nexpert's opinion was not conclusive, given the factors the jury was to balance. But the only factors\nthe jury was instructed in the charge to consider were “the utility of the product and the risk\ninvolved in its use.” Moreover, Martinez's expert testified that the defect in the wheel could have\nbeen remedied simply and without difficulty. Specifically, the expert testified as follows:\n\n   Q From the moment it came on the market the 16–1/2–inch rim could have been changed so\n   that you couldn't get the wrong sized tire on it.\n\n   A I believe it could, yes.\n\n   Q The same thing is not true for the 16–inch tire. There is no way to design or alter the 16–\n   inch tire so that somebody by mistake doesn't try to put it on a 16–1/2–inch wheel. That is true;\n   isn't it?\n\n   A I don't know of a way to do it, no. I have not seen a way to do that.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Let's be sure that we understand that in plain and simple English. It means, one, that\n   in 1980 General Motors directed its supplier Kelsey–Hayes to stamp something near the valve\n   hole and to place this warning in the well of every wheel it made after that.\n\n      A That is right.\n\n      Q And Ford never directed Budd to do anything until Budd stopped making the wheel in 1983.\n\n      A That's my recollection, yes.\n\n   Had the wheel size been stamped or labeled in the drop center or well of the wheel, it could\n   not have been obscured, no matter how dirty the wheel became, and Martinez could not have\n   missed it.\nThe evidence, including the testimony of Martinez's own expert, conclusively established that the\nwheel manufacturers bore some responsibility for Martinez's injuries. Since the evidence did not\nestablish the precise percentage of responsibility attributable to the wheel manufacturers, Goodrich\nis entitled only to a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                                        III\n\nMartinez offered, and the district court admitted in evidence, a list of thirty-four lawsuits against\nGoodrich involving claims for injuries suffered in attempting to mount 16” Goodrich tires on\n16.5” wheels. Goodrich complains that Martinez never laid a predicate for admitting this evidence,\nshowing the similarity of the other lawsuits to this one. The Court dismisses Goodrich's complaint\nin a sentence: “The absence of pictographic warnings on the tires does not render the accidents so\ndissimilar as to preclude their admission, but merely goes to the weight of the evidence.” 28\n\nThe Court has not met the substance of Goodrich's argument. First, Goodrich argues that Martinez\nlaid no predicate whatever for admission of the evidence. Martinez does not, and cannot, dispute\nthis. The district court admitted the list of lawsuits based solely on the statement of Martinez's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 40\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\ncounsel that the information had been produced by Goodrich in answer to an interrogatory in\ndiscovery. The interrogatory and answer were never offered in evidence (and are not in our record),\nnor was there any other proof to show the nature of the cases listed. A plaintiff who offers evidence\nof other accidents is “required to show that the earlier accidents occurred under reasonably similar\nbut not necessarily identical circumstances.” 29 Martinez made no showing *353 whatever. Thus,\nthe Court holds that evidence of other claims may be admitted with no more predicate than\ncounsel's argument that the claims are similar to the case in which they are offered. This, of course,\neviscerates any meaningful evidentiary standard.\n\nSecond, although Goodrich argued that the presence or absence of pictographic labels was a\nsignificant difference in claims of injury due to mismatch tires, that was not the only difference\nGoodrich claimed was significant. Other differences in the cases, according to Goodrich's counsel,\nwere how experienced the injured person was in changing tires, what safety equipment was\navailable, what kind of tire was involved and whether it was radial or bias ply, and what the result\nwas in the case. At least two of the cases were dismissed against Goodrich. The burden was not\non Goodrich to show that the other cases were different; the burden was on Martinez to show that\nthey were similar. 30 Nevertheless, Goodrich pointed out important differences to the court.\n\nThird, the presence of pictographic labels may have been a significant distinction in the cases. Of\nthe thirty-four on the list Martinez offered, only two involved pictographic labels. It may be that\nfewer accidents involved labeled tires because the labels were effective, or because fewer tires\nwere manufactured with labels, or because labels had been used for only a short time, or perhaps\nfor other reasons. Such arguments would go merely to the weight to be given the evidence, not\nits admissibility. But without any predicate at all offered by Martinez, it is impossible to say that\nthe presence of the label was not significant.\n\nFinally, admission of the list was extremely prejudicial to Goodrich. Martinez's counsel told the\ncourt before trial that “[i]n all these cases we keep talking about ... they keep killing and injuring\npeople”. Martinez's counsel asked his own expert witness: “And some tire companies it only\ntakes twenty-nine or thirty people to get killed or injured before they come to the conclusion\nthat maybe they ought to change their bead.” Martinez's counsel asked Goodrich's expert: “So\nhow many people have you all killed?” Without any predicate whatever, Martinez's counsel was\npermitted to use the list of lawsuits to insinuate repeatedly that others had been injured or killed\nin circumstances similar to those in this case. This was plainly error.\n\nThe lawsuit list was not the only exhibit erroneously admitted. The district court also admitted a\nchart sponsored by Martinez's expert witness showing the history of changes in bead wire design.\nThe Court's conclusion that “all the evidence contained on the chart was already in evidence” 31 is\nsimply false. There is absolutely no evidence of the very prejudicial reference on this time-line to\n“numerous 16/16.5 mismatch explosions resulting in serious injury or death.” It should go without\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328 (1998)\n\n\n\nsaying that a party should not be permitted to assert repeatedly that an opponent's product has\nkilled and injured people without proof that it is actually so.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago the Court held in Owens–Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone that evidence\nof anticipated or unpaid punitive damage claims is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible to show\npunitive damage liability. 32 If anticipated or unpaid punitive damage claims are not probative of\npunitive damage liability absent evidence of whether such claims have succeeded, I fail to see\nhow actual damage claims are probative of liability for actual damages absent the same evidence.\nToday's holding that evidence of other claims—whether proven or not, and whether similar or\nnot—is relevant and admissible to show liability directly conflicts with our decision in Owens–\nCorning and essentially destroys any standard for admitting evidence of other claims.\n\n\n\n                                                        IV\n\nThe Court holds that the district court erred in denying Goodrich's motion to bifurcate *354 the\nactual and punitive damages phases of the trial, but that the error was harmless because Martinez\noffered no evidence of Goodrich's net worth and the evidence of other lawsuits against Goodrich\nwas properly admitted. I have already shown that the list of lawsuits should not have been admitted\nwithout a predicate showing of similarity between each of the lawsuits and this case. But even if\nthe list of other lawsuits was properly admitted, it alone required a bifurcation of the actual and\npunitive damage claims.\n\nAs the Court notes, “[i]n [Transportation Insurance Co. v.] Moriel we held that ‘a trial court,\nif presented with a timely motion, should bifurcate the determination of the amount of punitive\ndamages from the remaining issues.” 33 Although we reasoned in Moriel that evidence of a\ndefendant's net worth offered on a punitive damage claim could unfairly prejudice a defendant\non plaintiff's claim for actual damages, we did not suggest that net worth evidence was the only\nprejudice in trying actual and punitive damage claims together. In the present case, Martinez's\ncounsel's repeated references to other claims against Goodrich were plainly intended to insinuate\nthat if others had been injured trying to mount Goodrich's 16” tires on 16.5” wheels, the tire was\ndefective, and the defect caused Martinez's injuries. The list of other lawsuits, even if properly\nadmitted, unfairly prejudiced Goodrich on Martinez's liability claim as much as evidence of its\nnet worth would have.\n\nThe district court refused Goodrich's motion to bifurcate the trial before evidence was offered and\nwithout regard to whether Martinez would offer evidence of net worth. The record shows that the\ndistrict court refused to follow Moriel because Martinez did not want a bifurcated trial. The court's\nerror clearly prejudiced Goodrich.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                42\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

Even if that were not so, Goodrich is entitled to have its liability\ndetermined in a fair trial in which at least some responsibility for the accident is assigned to\nMartinez and the wheel manufacturers, evidence of other claims against Goodrich is excluded until\na proper predicate is laid for its admission, and punitive damages are tried separately as required\nby Moriel. Because the Court denies Goodrich any relief, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n977 S.W.2d 328\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The rim involved in this case was manufactured in 1979. The Budd Company ceased manufacturing 16.5” rims in 1983.\n\n2    Goodrich has ceased manufacturing bias-ply light truck tires.\n\n3    Although not applicable to the present case, the Texas Legislature has recently codified the “reasonably safe alternative” requirement.\n        TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 82.005 (safer alternative design must be shown by preponderance of the evidence in design\n        defect case).\n4       While there is language in Turner suggesting that whether a safer alternative design exists is merely one of the factors to be weighed\n        by the jury, see 584 S.W.2d at 846–47, we made clear in Caterpillar that a safer alternative is a prerequisite to a finding of design\n        defect, see 911 S.W.2d at 384. Our approach in Caterpillar is reflected in the new Restatement.\n5       This illustration is based on Uloth v. City Tank Corp., 376 Mass. 874, 384 N.E.2d 1188 (1978).\n\n6       As discussed in part V of this opinion, we uphold the jury's finding that Martinez was not negligent.\n\n7       We disagree with the dissenting justices that the trial court admitted evidence of these accidents “with no more predicate than counsel's\n        argument that the claims are similar to the case in which they were offered.” Post at 353. At the pretrial hearing on this issue, the\n        Martinezes' counsel informed the court that Goodrich had identified these accidents in response to an interrogatory asking, “How many\n        people do you acknowledge have been injured as a result of mounting or attempting to mount 16 inch diameter tires manufactured\n        by you on a 16.5 inch diameter rim?” While the interrogatory itself may not be in our record, the Martinezes' counsel read it into the\n        record at the pretrial hearing, and no one disputes its wording or that Goodrich identified the thirty-four accidents in response to it.\n        Thus, the Martinezes established that each of the other accidents involved an injury resulting from mounting a 16” Goodrich tire on\n        a 16.5” rim. Further, it was undisputed that each of the other accidents involved a tape bead like that involved in this accident. Under\n        these circumstances, there was an adequate predicate on which to admit the other accidents.\n8       We thus need not address the court of appeals' conclusion that Goodrich failed to properly preserve this complaint.

Appellee also challenges the award\nof attorney's fees in a cross-point. The trial court's judgment is affirmed in part and reversed and\nrendered in part.\n\nOn May 12, 1967, Jack G. Jones, Trustee, and SCM Corporation executed a “build to suit”\nlease covering the land located at 5702 Hillcroft in Houston. Jones agreed to construct an office-\nwarehouse building and lease it and the property to SCM for twenty years. Three land areas\nremained after construction of the building—one on the front and one each on the north and south\nsides of the building.\n\nOn July 21, 1983, SCM subleased approximately 6,168 square feet of the building to Sabel's\nT.V. Service, Inc. (Sabel). This lease was made subject to the Jones—SCM or master lease, with\nparagraph 20 stating the following:\n\n            20. Parking of Automobiles. General parking shall be in the front and on the\n            north side of the general parking area and there shall be no assigned parking\n            spaces provided for any Tenant in these areas.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\nOn January 12, 1984, SCM subleased another 7,224 square feet of the building to Brewington, Inc.\nunder the following arrangement. SCM (more commonly known as Smith-Corona) was engaged\nin the business of selling and repairing business machines; however, that company decided to close\nits factory service station in Houston and turn the servicing over to an authorized representative,\nwho would make repairs on SCM's behalf and then bill SCM. SCM selected Brewington, a local\ntypewriter company, as its representative and stipulated that Brewington move into its premises.\nSCM wanted the repair station to stay at that location because customers were familiar with it and\nbecause certain literature and the machines themselves contained that service address and phone\nnumber.\n\nSCM appears to have copied the Brewington sublease from the Sabel sublease. Indeed, paragraph\n8 of the Brewington sublease is identical to paragraph 9 of the Sabel sublease, which states that\n“Tenant shall be entitled to use the Demised Premises *901 for the service and repair and sales\nof televisions and other related electronic equipment.” Brewington sells and repairs typewriters\nand computer printers, but not televisions and other related electronic equipment. The Brewington\nsublease also was made subject to the master lease, and parking (paragraph 19) was provided for\nin language identical to that in the Sabel sublease.\n\nOn August 1, 1984, with SCM's consent, Brewington subleased 2,700 square feet of its lease space\nto Amstar Satellite Systems, Inc. Once again, the Sabel sublease appears to have been used as\nthe model for this new sublease, though the “use” paragraph (paragraph 8) was changed to reflect\nAmstar's actual business. The parking paragraph (paragraph 19) once again remained unchanged.\n\nOn December 25, 1984, Jack G. Jones, Trustee, conveyed all of the property and the Hillcroft\nbuilding to United Interests, Inc., Trustee, which purchased the property as trustee for a partnership\nconsisting of United Interests, Inc. and others. One month later, SCM assigned all of its rights as\nlessee under the master lease to United Interests.\n\nUnited Interests notified Brewington of the SCM assignment by letter of February 7, 1985, and\nalso advised that a physical inspection of the premises was in progress. On February 20th, United\nInterests wrote Brewington that the inspection was complete, enclosed a copy of the repair bid\nand requested from Brewington a proportionate share (50% or $27,560.00) of the repair expenses.\nThereafter, on March 18th, United Interests informed Brewington that, due to the latter's failure\nto contribute its share of the repair expenses or to make arrangements for the repairs, United\nInterests was giving formal notice of default under the Brewington sublease and reserved the right\nto terminate the sublease unless Brewington contributed to or arranged for repairs within thirty\ndays.\n\nThere was no further communication until July 11, 1985, when United Interests' attorney wrote\nBrewington that property immediately to the south of the building had been leased to CSI Collision\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 10\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\nSpecialist, Inc. (d/b/a CSI Used Cars). The letter advised Brewington that this property included a\nportion of the parking area south of the building and that parking on the south side by Brewington's\nemployees and customers would not be permitted. Almost immediately, Brewington filed suit for\nan injunction and a declaration of its rights under its sublease. United Interests counterclaimed for\na declaration of its rights under the leases in question. CSI filed a related action for injunctive relief\nand damages against Brewington, and the causes of action were consolidated for trial. Following\nthe trial, the court entered judgment for Brewington and filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law. CSI is not a party to this appeal.\n\nIn points of error one through four, United Interests asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of\nlaw in finding ambiguity in the Brewington sublease; in allowing the admission of parol evidence\nto vary its terms; in allowing the admission of hearsay evidence to explain its terms; and in\nreforming the terms of the sublease.\n\n [1] [2] In Conclusion of Law No. II, the trial court concluded that paragraphs 8 (use) and 19\n(parking) of the sublease between SCM and Brewington were ambiguous. We agree. The question\nof whether a contract is ambiguous is one of law for the court. R & P Enterprises v. LaGuarta,\nGavrel & Kirk, Inc., 596 S.W.2d 517, 518 (Tex.1980). When interpreting a contract, a court's\nprimary concern is to ascertain and to give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the\ninstrument. To do so, the court must examine and consider the entire instrument so that none of its\nprovisions will be rendered meaningless. A contract is ambiguous only when the application of the\npertinent rules of interpretation leaves it genuinely uncertain which one of two or more meanings\nis the proper one. If a contract is determined to be ambiguous, then extrinsic evidence is *902\nadmissible to discover its true meaning. Id. at 518–19. With these precepts in mind, we examine\nthe sublease in question.\n\n [3] Paragraph 19 concerning parking is ambiguous in and of itself. Neither “general parking” nor\n“general parking area” is defined. The term “general parking” implies that there is also some other\nkind of parking. “General parking area” equates with the entire parking lot, and the paragraph\ncould be interpreted as requiring that employees and customers park in the front of or on the north\nside of both the north and south parking areas. Finally, the paragraph does not read “in the front\nand on the north side of the building ”, which would more readily comport with United Interests'\ndesired interpretation.\n\n [4] The ambiguity is compounded when paragraph 19 is considered with the rest of the sublease,\nparticularly paragraph 15, which concerns remodeling of the premises. Brewington agreed to\naccept the premises “as is” “excepting repairs of parking lot and facade made at SCM's expense” (a\nphrase interlineated by Brewington's president). The paragraph did not address whether repairs\nwere to be restricted to a certain part of the parking lot. Indeed, trial testimony confirmed that\nrepairs were made to both the north and south parking areas and paid for by SCM. Brewington's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     11\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\nconcern about repairs to the parking lot suggests that a well-maintained one was essential to its\noccupancy of the building. This renders even more ambiguous a lease term that would then restrict\nthe use of that lot.\n\n [5] The trial court found that the interlineation of paragraph 15 and the general ambiguity of\nparagraph 19 allowed parol evidence of Brewington's need for, as well as prior use of, the south\nparking lot. Again, we agree. Preston Whitfill was a service manager for SCM at the Hillcroft\nlocation. When Brewington contracted to do SCM's warranty work in the Houston area and moved\ninto SCM's leased space, Whitfill went to work for Brewington. He, therefore, was in a position to\nknow what transpired during the tenures of both companies. Whitfill testified that SCM employees\nhad parked on the south side of the building and that Brewington's employees continued to do so\nafter the move. He further testified that deliveries to both companies were made to the back door\non the south side of the building because the service department was located there and because\ndelivery through the front of the building was difficult due to a narrow hallway and several sharp\nturns.\n\nJohnny Johnson, Brewington's president, testified that the company utilizes the south lot in its\nday-to-day business. It is where employees and customers park, deliveries are received and sent\nand the trash dumpster is located. Were the south lot not available for Brewington's use, business\nwould be adversely affected.\n\nBoth Lee Sabel, owner of Sabel's T.V. Service, Inc., which subleased from SCM, and Charles\nHarvey, owner of Amstar Satellite Systems, Inc., which subleased from Brewington, testified that\nBrewington's employees generally park in the south lot. Furthermore, the men stated that their\nemployees also had used the south lot when the north and front lots were full (with Whitfill's and,\nlater, Brewington's permission).\n\n [6] [7] United Interests next complains of the admission of hearsay evidence to explain the terms\nof the SCM-Brewington sublease. This complaint appears to center on Preston Whitfill's testimony\nconcerning his conversations about the parking lot with certain SCM representatives, particularly\nSandy Swartzberg, a regional service manager. In a trial before the court, the presumption is that\nthe court did not consider hearsay. Landscape Design and Construction, Inc. v. Harold Thomas\nExcavating, Inc., 604 S.W.2d 374, 378 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Further,\nany error in its admission is harmless because there was sufficient evidence, without the hearsay,\nto resolve the ambiguity. Id. We refer to the above-cited *903 testimony regarding Brewington's\nneed for and prior use of the south parking lot, as well as Johnny Johnson's testimony that he\nunderstood the lease area to include that lot.\n\n [8] Finally, United Interests' argument that the trial court erred in reforming the terms of the\nsublease is without merit. The trial court did not reform the terms of the sublease. Once the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               12\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\ncourt found that certain paragraphs in the sublease were ambiguous, it admitted parol evidence to\ndetermine the parties' intentions and then interpreted the sublease, taking all its parts together and\ngiving them such meaning as will carry out and effectuate to the fullest extent the parties' intention.\nCity of Pinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water Co., 432 S.W.2d 515, 519 (Tex.1968). Points of error\none through four are overruled.\n\nIn points of error five through eight, United Interests argues that the trial court erred as a matter\nof law in finding mutual mistake in the execution of the Brewington sublease; in allowing the\nadmission of parol evidence to vary its terms; in allowing the admission of hearsay testimony to\nexplain its terms; and in reforming the terms of the sublease.\n\nIn Conclusion of Law No. I, the trial court found that the Brewington sublease was entered into\nas a result of mistake and/or mutual misconceptions in regard to paragraphs 8 and 19. We agree.\n\n [9] [10] [11] A mutual mistake of fact occurs when both parties to a transaction have a belief\nin the present existence of a thing, material to the transaction, that does not exist. Such would\nbe the case where the parties to a contract have a common intention, but the written contract\nerroneously reflects that intention because of a mistake by both parties in writing the agreement.\nTurberville v. Upper Valley Farms, Inc., 616 S.W.2d 676, 678 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi\n1981, no writ). Parol evidence is admissible to show that the writing, because of the mistake,\nincorrectly reflects the true agreement, and the equitable remedy of reformation is available to\ncorrect the mistake. However, the party claiming relief must show what the parties' true agreement\nwas and that the instrument incorrectly reflects that agreement because of a mutual mistake. Estes\nv. Republic National Bank of Dallas, 462 S.W.2d 273, 275 (Tex.1970).\n\n [12] Upon examination of the Sabel and Brewington subleases, it is clear that the latter was copied\nfrom the former. They are identical in format and vary only in certain provisions specific to each\ncompany, such as rent and term of lease. This would explain the fact that the use paragraphs (9\nin Sabel and 8 in Brewington) are exactly the same, regardless of the fact that Brewington sells\nand repairs typewriters rather than “televisions and other related electronic equipment” (Sabel's\nbusiness). Clearly, the use paragraph was overlooked in the revision process, and this lends\ncredence to Brewington's argument that the parking paragraph also was overlooked. The trial\ncourt thus properly admitted parol evidence to show that the lease incorrectly reflected the true\nagreement of the parties.\n\nJohnny Johnson testified that when SCM stipulated that Brewington take over SCM's lease area\nas part of their arrangement, he understood that area to include the south parking lot. No one\never indicated to him that SCM would retain the right to lease that lot to a third party. He also\nunderstood that the only limitation in paragraph 19 on Brewington's use of the parking lot was that\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  13\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\nthere were to be no assigned parking spaces. Johnson further testified that when he interlineated\nthe language in paragraph 15 about repairs to the lot, he was referring to the south lot.\n\nTaken in the context of the evidence concerning SCM and Brewington's prior use of the south lot,\nthe repairs to it and the need for access to that lot, Johnson's testimony tends to establish what the\nparties' true agreement was. In addition, there is Preston Whitfill's testimony that as a principal\n *904 SCM employee during the period of negotiations between SCM and Brewington, he was\nnever notified that the south parking lot was to be excluded from the lease area. Furthermore, he\nremembered discussing the repairs of that lot with Sandy Swartzberg, who agreed to do the repairs\nfor Brewington at SCM's expense. Whitfill also testified that after the dispute over the parking\nlot arose between Brewington and United Interests, he called Swartzberg, who told him United\nInterests did not have the right to lease out the south parking area because that was part of the\nBrewington property.\n\nTurning to the evidence that the sublease incorrectly reflects the agreement between SCM and\nBrewington because of a mutual mistake by both parties, we reiterate that the Brewington\nsublease clearly was copied from the Sabel sublease and, in the process, several paragraphs were\noverlooked. During trial Lee Sabel verified that the Sabel sublease provided for parking on the\nnorth side for his approximately thirty employees. Both Whitfill and Johnson testified that the\nBrewington sublease was prepared by the SCM legal department in New York City rather than in\nHouston. Whitfill also testified that Janice Smith in that department had acknowledged that the\nBrewington sublease was Sabel's sublease (with the implication that the allotted parking space\nwas also Sabel's).\n\nJohnny Johnson had an opportunity to review and change the parking paragraph in the sublease\nduring both the original negotiations and the later leasing of space to Amstar and did not do so.\nAppellant argues this indicates that parking was not a material term of the sublease. However, the\ntestimony regarding Brewington's utilization of the south lot in its day-to-day business disputes\nthat assumption. It is equally possible that use of the south lot was so material to the agreement\nthat both parties assumed it had been properly resolved. Indeed, when asked if it were possible\nthat SCM planned to lease the lot to a third party, Preston Whitfill responded, “Wouldn't make\nsense gaining money off of one side they would be taking it from the other because they would\nbe screwing up the guarantee station.”\n\n [13] United Interests also objects to the admission of hearsay evidence to show the mutuality of\nthe mistake. Again, we note that in a bench trial, the presumption is that the court did not consider\nhearsay, and any error in its admission is harmless as there was sufficient evidence without it to\nshow mutual mistake.

Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\n [14] [15] As to United Interests' contention in point eight that the trial court erred in reforming the\nterms of the Brewington sublease, the court was entitled to do so once it determined the existence\nof a mutual mistake. Estes, 462 S.W.2d at 275. In this case, however, the court simply filed\nconclusions of law stating both the intent of paragraph 8 and the most reasonable interpretation\nof paragraph 19 and then, in its judgment, permanently enjoined United Interests from interfering\nwith Brewington's use of the south parking lot incidental to its rights under its sublease. Points of\nerror five through eight are overruled.\n\n [16] In points of error nine and ten, United Interests maintains that the court erred in declaring\nthat the right to exclusive use and occupancy or the right to use any part of the south parking lot\nwas and is incidental and necessary to Brewington's business and the effectuation of the intent of\nthe sublease. In points eleven and twelve, United Interests argues that the court erred in declaring\nthat Brewington has a right under the sublease to the exclusive use and occupancy of any portion\nof that lot. Point of error thirteen states that the court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction\nagainst United Interests.\n\nAs noted above, in its judgment the trial court permanently enjoined United Interests from\ninterfering with Brewington's use of the south parking lot incidental to its rights under its lease.\nNowhere did the *905 court declare that Brewington has the right to exclusive use and occupancy\nof the lot. Neither did the court declare that use of the lot is incidental and necessary to Brewington's\nbusiness, though in its closing statements, the court made clear this was a key reason for ruling as\nit did. As previously discussed, the evidence supported this determination. Brewington is located\non the south side of the building and access to the business by employees, customers and delivery\npersons is enhanced by access to the south parking lot, particularly as the service department is\nlocated at the back end of the south side. Furthermore, there are too few spaces in the front and\nnorth lots to accommodate all of the building's tenants and their customers, as evidenced by Lee\nSabel's testimony that when the north lot was full, his employees parked in the south lot.\n\nThe trial court's judgment did not declare Brewington's rights under the sublease but rather upheld\nBrewington's rights under the sublease to use the lot. In its Conclusion of Law No. IV, the court\ninterpreted those rights as including primary parking in the south lot, without limitation to use any\nof the parking areas on the leased premises, subject to the sole limitation that no tenant has the\nright to specifically reserve assigned parking places. Once the court found ambiguity and mutual\nmistake in the lease, it was then entitled to interpret it. City of Pinehurst, 432 S.W.2d at 519; Estes,\n462 S.W.2d at 275.\n\nFinally, United Interests' point of error that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the\ninjunction is without merit. This follows from our disposition of points one through twelve. Points\nof error nine through thirteen are overruled.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    15\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\n [17] [18] In point of error fourteen, United Interests asserts that the trial court erred in refusing\nto declare the rights of United Interests under the sublease. The entry of a declaratory judgment\nrests within the discretion of the trial judge. Crawford v. City of Houston, 600 S.W.2d 891, 894\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Denying the losing party's requested\nrelief is not an abuse of that discretion. Further, in its argument, United Interests states, “The\nquestion of United Interests' rights may best be addressed through a determination of Brewington's\nrights under its sublease with respect to the use of the South parking lot.” In effect, this is what\nthe trial court has done. By decreeing that Brewington has the right to use the south parking lot\nwithout interference, the court necessarily implies that United Interests does not have the right to\ninterfere with that use. Yet, the sublease continues in full force and effect as to the other landlord/\ntenant rights. The fourteenth point of error is overruled.\n\n [19] In point of error fifteen, United Interests complains that the trial court erred in declaring\nthat the acts of United Interests constituted an attempted constructive eviction of Brewington and\nthat those acts provided a legal basis to enjoin United Interests from pursuing its rights under the\nsublease. In his bench statements, the trial judge stated that the attempt to restrict Brewington's use\nof the south parking lot was tantamount to constructive eviction. There is evidence in the record\nthat United Interests planned to re-develop this property and had discussed with its tenants the\npossibility of moving them. This evidence, coupled with the acts of United Interests in assessing\nexcessive maintenance charges against Brewington, in declaring Brewington in default of its lease\nagreement and in leasing the south parking lot to CSI, supports the trial court's conclusion. Whether\nthat conclusion may have provided the court with a legal basis for the injunction is immaterial. In\nactuality the court found that under the sublease Brewington had the right to use the south parking\nlot without interference and properly enjoined United Interests from so interfering. Point of error\nfifteen is overruled.\n\nIn point of error sixteen United Interests complains of the trial court's award of attorney's *906\nfees on appeal. In a cross-point Brewington attacks the trial court's failure to award it attorney's\nfees for legal services through the trial court. Brewington presented evidence of more than $26,000\nin attorney's fees through the trial court, $2,500 for appeal through the court of appeals, and $1,000\nfor appeal to the supreme court. United Interests presented evidence of its attorney's fees in excess\nof $30,000 through the trial court, $3,000 for appeal through the court of appeals, and $2,000 for\nappeal to the supreme court.\n\nThe court awarded neither party attorney's fees through the trial court; however, it did award\nBrewington $10,000 should United Interests appeal to the court of appeals and Brewington prevail,\nand an additional $5,000 should United Interests apply for a writ of error and Brewington again\nprevail. United Interests argues that the court abused its discretion in its award of fees for appeal\nbecause it refused to award fees for trial and because the attorney's fees awarded for appeal are\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 16\n\fUnited Interests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897 (1987)\n\n\n\nclearly excessive and unreasonable. Brewington charges the court with an abuse of discretion in\nfailing to award it attorney's fees for legal services through the trial court.\n\n [20] [21] Regarding the cross-point, Brewington argues that given the evidence of United\nInterests' bad faith, an award of attorney's fees for trial was justified. The award of attorney's fees\nin a declaratory judgment action is discretionary. Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.009 (Vernon\n1986) (formerly Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2524–1 § 10 (Vernon 1965)). In supplemental findings\nof fact the court stated that it found no sufficient cause to justify the award of attorney's fees to\neither party for the trial phase. It is clear from this finding and from bench statements that the court\nrecognized both parties had legitimate rights to pursue and, therefore, each should bear its own\nattorney's fees through the trial court. Given the facts of this case, this was not an unreasonable\naction by the trial court. Therefore, Brewington's cross-point is overruled.\n\n [22] Next we consider the trial court's award to Brewington of attorney's fees on appeal. Under\nthe record before us we cannot understand how there could be sufficient cause to justify the award\nof attorney's fees on appeal, there being no sufficient cause to justify the award of such fees\nthrough the trial court. On this record and in light of the trial court's finding regarding attorney's\nfees through the trial court, we hold the trial court erred and abused its discretion in awarding to\nBrewington any attorney's fees on appeal.\n\nUnited Interests' points of error seventeen, eighteen and nineteen concern the trial court's failure\nto declare the rights of the parties under the master lease after declaring that obligations for repair\nand maintenance were to be controlled in the future by that lease; the failure to declare the parties'\nobligations for repair and maintenance under the Brewington sublease as they existed prior to final\njudgment; and the court's error in declaring the parties' rights and Brewington's obligations under\nits sublease in such a manner that the controversy was not ended and indeed created piecemeal\nlitigation.\n\n [23] [24] [25] A trial court may grant a declaratory judgment where it would serve a useful,\nbeneficial purpose. Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Fraiman, 514 S.W.2d 343, 346 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Houston [14th Dist.] 1974, no writ). In its final judgment, the trial court declares that no default\nby Brewington exists under the sublease. By further declaring that the master lease will henceforth\ngovern Brewington's obligations, the court provides the framework within which both parties\nshould operate. To declare rights and obligations under the lease anticipates a conflict which may\nwell be resolved by the court's action regarding the use of the south parking lot. Anticipation of\na conflict is not a proper subject for declaratory relief. See Southern National Bank of Houston\nv. City of Austin, 582 S.W.2d 229, 237 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Entry of a\ndeclaratory judgment is discretionary, *907 Crawford, 600 S.W.2d at 894, and we find no abuse\nof that discretion in this case. We therefore overrule points of error seventeen through nineteen.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Acker, Sr., as well as overriding royalties assigned to\ntheir son, Edwin V. Acker, Jr. Appellants also claimed breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy\nby appellees in obtaining the overriding royalties. In addition, appellants claimed that Edwin\nV.

The trial court indicated that the\nsummary judgment would be granted but wanted to resolve the matter of attorney fees before\nsigning the final judgment. Prior to the hearing on attorney fees, appellants filed a motion to\nstrike appellees' counterclaim for declaratory relief and for attorney fees under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act.

The partition deed to\nJohnie Lorene Acker setting apart to her the 1,200 acres of land therein described contained the\nfollowing reservation:\n\n           Provided, however, it is expressly understood and agreed by each and all of the\n           parties hereto that no part of the oil, gas, or other minerals in, on, or under the\n           above-described lands are hereby conveyed or are intended or affected by this\n           instrument except as hereinafter provided, and the parties hereto, their respective\n           heirs and assigns, shall continue to own and hold in common all of the oil, gas\n           and other minerals, in, on, and under all of the above-described lands in the same\n           undivided proportion that said parties now own and hold said oil, gas and other\n           minerals together with the right to ingress and egress at all times for the purposes\n           of mining, drilling and exploring said lands for oil, gas and other minerals and\n           removing the same therefrom, and none of the royalties, reversionary interests,\n           or other rights of said parties under existing oil, gas and mineral leases shall be\n           affected in any manner by this instrument; it being further provided, however,\n           anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, that the grantee of\n           the surface estate herein, Johnie Lorene Acker, shall have the exclusive right\n           to execute, without the joinder of any of the grantors herein, any oil, gas or\n           mineral lease that she desires on any such terms as she may desire, and receive,\n           as her separate property, such bonuses, oil payments, and rentals as may be paid\n           under said oil, gas and mineral leases so executed by her, except that she shall\n           reserve in each oil, gas, and mineral lease so executed by her a base one-eighth\n           (#) royalty interest for the benefit of herself and the other four children of J.E.\n           Murphy, deceased, grantors herein, in the same proportion they now own same.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Murphy, the other partition deeds were all executed in October,\n1948, by the same five children. One of the partition deeds awarded and set apart to Edna Mae\nJones certain lands in McMullen County, Texas. One of the partition deeds awarded to Julia\nAuthelia Akers (now Julia Authelia Winslow) certain lands upon which she and her husband were\nthen living in LaSalle County, Texas. One of the partition deeds awarded and set apart to Emmett\nGranvel Murphy certain lands in McMullen and Duval Counties, Texas. Each of the four partition\ndeeds contained identical provisions.\n\nMabel Mullin Snowden, one of the children of J.E. Murphy, had acquired a tract of land prior to\nhis death. These lands were situated in LaSalle and Dimmit Counties, Texas, conveyed to her by\ndeed on September 28, 1945, and recorded in the deed records of LaSalle County, Texas. This\nconveyance to Mabel M. Snowden included the oil, gas and mineral estate in the lands therein\ndescribed. Following the death of her father and by deed dated October 27, 1948, Mabel M.\nSnowden conveyed to her sisters, Edna Mae Jones, Johnie Lorene Acker, Julia Authelia Akers\nand *325 her brother, Emmett Granvel Murphy, in equal shares, an undivided four-fifths ( 4 /5)\ninterest in and to all the oil, gas and minerals acquired by her by such deed (the “Snowden Deed”)\nof September 28, 1945. Edna Mae Jones, Johnie Lorene Acker, Mabel Mullin Snowden, Julia\nAuthelia Akers and Virginia Gertrude Akers Murphy (the surviving wife of Emmett Granvel\nMurphy) entered into a Declaration and Agreement, dated December 9, 1953, and recorded it in\nthe deed records of LaSalle County, Texas. This deed confirmed the parties' intentions with respect\nto the rights of the surface owner and the sharing of any royalties by the surface owner.\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker executed four oil and gas leases, each conveying a portion of the lands\nawarded and set apart to her in the partition deed to her, each lease being to Murphy H. Baxter,\nas lessee. Murphy H. Baxter assigned to Johnie Lorene Acker and her husband, Edwin V. Acker,\nSr., a five and one-half percent (5½%) overriding royalty in and to the four leases by assignment\ndated March 24, 1981, and recorded in the deed records of McMullen County, Texas.\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker died April 8, 1983, and her interest in the overriding royalty passed to her\nsons, Edwin V. Acker, Jr. and Emmett A. Acker, as independent co-executors and trustees under\nher will. Edwin V. Acker, Sr., died November 4, 1987, and Edwin V. Acker, Jr. and Emmett A.\nAcker were appointed independent co-executors of his estate and have been substituted as legal\nrepresentatives of Edwin V. Acker, Sr., in his stead in this cause.\n\nIn their first point of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding that the terms\n“base one-eighth royalty” in the four partition deeds; “basic one-eighth royalty,” in the Declaration\nand Agreement and “above the one-eighth royalty” in the Snowden Deed, should be construed\ntogether and interpreted as limiting the non-executives' mineral interest to only four-fifths ( 4 /5)\nof a one-eighth (#) royalty.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (1989)\n\n\n\nAppellants have referred to alleged findings by the trial court and the basis for the trial court's\ndecision throughout their argument. Appellants' conclusions and assertions as to the trial court's\nfindings and the basis for the trial court's decision are unsupported by the record. The trial court\nmade no findings of fact and the trial court gave no specific reasons for its decision. Further,\nfindings of fact are not made in summary judgment proceedings. Even if the court were to give\nan incorrect reason for its judgment, the judgment must be upheld on any legal theory before this\nCourt. Guaranty County Mutual Ins. Co. v. Reyna, 709 S.W.2d 647, 648 (Tex.1986).\n\nAppellants' argument under point of error one contains two interrelated contentions. First,\nappellants allege that a question of fact exists due to an ambiguity relating to the terms “base one-\neighth royalty,” and “basic one-eighth royalty” in the Acker Partition Deed. Second, appellants\nassert that the Snowden Deed is subject to the ambiguous language contained in the Acker Partition\nDeed, thereby raising a fact question as to the construction of the Snowden Deed. We disagree with\nappellants' initial contention that the Acker Partition Deed is ambiguous. Therefore, appellants'\nargument concerning the application of the Acker Partition Deed to the Snowden Deed is moot.\n\n[1] In considering appellants' argument concerning an alleged ambiguous term, we must first\ndetermine whether the document is in fact ambiguous. If we so conclude, then extrinsic evidence\nmay be considered to determine the intent of the parties. Generally, construction of an ambiguous\ndocument presents a question of fact, and summary judgment would, therefore, be improper.\nHowever, undisputed parol evidence may resolve the ambiguity as a matter of law. Security\nSavings Ass'n v. Clifton, 755 S.W.2d 925, 931 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1988, no writ).\n\nThe interpretation of an unambiguous deed presents a question of law for the court. Altman v.\nBlake, 712 S.W.2d 117, 118 (Tex.1986). The parties' intent must be ascertained by applying the\n“four corners rule.” Id. In so doing, the court must recognize that the parties “intend every *326\nclause to have some effect and in some measure to evidence their agreement.” Id.\n\nAppellants contend that the trial court erred by failing to subject the reservation in the Acker\nPartition Deed to the applicable rules of interpretation and construction, so as to give effect\nand harmonize every provision contained in the reservation. Appellants then claim that the legal\ninterpretation of the reservation yields a different result than that reached by the trial court. Finally,\nappellants conclude that the trial court's construction of the Acker Partition Deed has the effect of\nrendering meaningless the broad mineral interest in the first part of the reservation clause.\n\nThe first portion of the deed declares that no part of the minerals are conveyed or affected “except\nas hereinafter provided.” That portion of the reservation concludes that “none of the royalties,\nreversionary interests, or other rights of said parties under existing oil, gas and mineral leases shall\nbe affected in any manner by this instrument,” thereby limiting the foregoing language to those\nrights of the parties existing under leases in existence at the time of the execution of the partition\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       7\n\fWinslow v. Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (1989)\n\n\n\ndeed. The second portion of the reservation begins, “it being further provided, however, anything\nin the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,” and then strips the grantors of four of the five\nessential elements of a mineral interest, leaving only the right of the grantors to receive a portion of\nthe royalties under future leases. See Altman v. Blake, 712 S.W.2d 117, 118 (Tex.1986) (holding\nthat the five essential elements of a severed mineral estate, are (1) the right to develop [the right\nof ingress and egress]; (2) the right to lease [the executive right]; (3) the right to receive bonus\npayments; (4) the right to receive delay rentals and (5) the right to receive royalty payments). By\nits express terms, the second part of the reservation controls the preceding portion.\n\nThe gist of appellants' argument is that the deed is unclear as to whether they are entitled to a\nset fraction of production or fractions of subsequent royalties to be determined by the terms of\nfuture leases.\n\n [2] Appellants' assertions are viable only if we ignore the introductory phrase of the second part\nof the reservation. Ironically, their arguments can be supported only if we disregard the case law\nthey attempt to use to support their argument.\n\nIn Tiller v. Tiller, 685 S.W.2d 456 (Tex.App.—Austin 1985, no writ) and Helms v. Guthrie, 573\nS.W.2d 855 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.), the owners of an interest in a\nfraction of production were limited to that fraction and were not entitled to a “fraction of royalty”\nto be determined upon execution of some future lease. Appellants are attempting to construe the\nlanguage under the Acker Partition Deed so as to permit the appellants to share in four-fifths ( 4 /5)\nof whatever royalties may be contracted for, so long as such royalty is at least a royalty of one-\neighth (#).\n\nAppellants cite Flippen v. Flippen, 628 S.W.2d 462 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1981, no writ) to support\ntheir construction of the reservation. Under the partition deeds in Flippen, the parties were given a\nspecific fractional interest “of the oil royalty, gas royalty, and royalty in casinghead gas, gasoline\nand royalty in all other minerals.” Id. at 465. The same clause which reserved the undivided interest\nlater provided that any future lease shall provide for at least a royalty “of the usual [one-eighth] #.”\nId. The court held that the later restriction on the grantees' authority to make oil and gas leases did\nnot create an ambiguity or alter the specific reservation of royalty as provided for in the partition\ndeeds. Id. at 466. The language in the Flippen deeds is clearly distinguishable from the reservation\nin the Acker Partition Deed.\n\nIn the Acker Partition Deed, the parties expressly agreed and contracted that Johnie Lorene Acker\n“shall reserve in each oil, gas and mineral lease so executed by her, a base one-eighth (#) royalty\ninterest for the benefit of herself and the other four children of J.E. Murphy, deceased, grantors\nherein, in the same proportion they now own the same.” Appellants in effect reserved four-fifths\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (1989)\n\n\n\n( 4 /5) of one-eighth (#), or *327 four-fortieths ( 4 /40), of production from the lands described in\nthe Acker Partition Deed.\n\nThe court in Tiller, supra, held that while the partition deed in question in one section used the\nphrase “all of the # lease hold rights,” the deed apparently conveyed outright ownership of the\nmineral estate to each individual under his respective tract. The court further held that:\n\n  Each tract was subject to a # royalty interest which was to be shared among the partitioners. The\n  owner of each individual tract would receive 2 /9 of the # royalty with each remaining partitioner\n  receiving 1 /9 of # (which was clearly expressed as 1 /72) of the minerals in and under the tracts\n  conveyed to their copartitioners.\n\n  The partition deed expressly granted the owner of each individual tract all rights regarding the\n  execution of oil and gas leases on his tract as well as the right to receive all bonus monies or\n  other considerations. The only restriction on the individual owners as to the development of\n  their mineral estate was a provision that any lease must provide at least a # royalty interest to\n  be shared, as described above, among the original partitioners and their successors.\n\n685 S.W.2d at 458. Tiller cites with approval Helms v. Guthrie, 573 S.W.2d 855 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Fort Worth 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.), which held that reservation of “½ of the #th royalty (same\nbeing a 1 /16th of the total production) of oil, gas and minerals” was a contractual limitation and\nconcluded that Helms owned a ‘fractional royalty,’ of 1 /16th of the total production, not a ‘fraction\nof royalty,’ determinable upon the execution of some future lease.” Id. at 857. In addition, Tiller\nheld that the partition deed contained clear and unambiguous language that conveyed 1 /9 of the #\nroyalty, ( 1 /72) of all the oil, gas and other minerals produced from said land.” Therefore, the court\nrejected the arguments that the deed was ambiguous. 685 S.W.2d at 458.\n\n [3] Appellants also argue that ambiguity exists in the Acker Partition Deed due to the varying\ninterpretations of the terms “base” and “basic” one-eighth royalty. Appellants have attempted to\ncreate an ambiguity by focusing on out-of-context words or phrases, as opposed to interpreting\nsuch words or phrases within the context of the document as a whole.\n\nThe use of the terms “base” and “basic” were clearly not intended to expand or contract the\nfractional royalty interest reserved by the grantors in the Acker Partition Deed. The grantors\nreserved their portion ( 4 /5) of the one-eighth (#) royalty for future leases. The terms “base”\nand “basic” are descriptive, not modifying, terms indicating the type of royalty from which the\nfractional interest was to be reserved.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (1989)\n\n\n\nAppellants' complaints concerning their interest in the Snowden Deed are premised on their\nincorrect argument that the Acker Partition Deed is ambiguous. Therefore, the remainder of\nappellants' argument under this point of error is moot. Point of error one is overruled.\n\nIn their second point of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding that they were\nnot entitled to share in the overriding royalties received by Johnie Lorene Acker and her husband,\nand by Edwin V. Acker, Jr. Appellants assert that appellees identified certain mineral interest fees\nas bonus payments rather than royalties and that appellants are entitled to 4 /5 of these proceeds.\n\n [4] Questions concerning the classifications of royalty and mineral interests are immaterial to\nour disposition of this case. It is clear from the Acker Partition Deed that appellants parted with\nany rights to participate in bonuses, rentals, oil payments and production over and above an\nundivided four-fifths ( 4 /5) of a base one-eighth (#) royalty. The grantees in the Acker Partition\nDeed contractually limited their participation in the production from the property to sharing in\ntheir proportionate part of the one-eighth (#) royalty. Appellants are entitled to nothing more. Point\nof error two is overruled.\n\nIn their third point of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting *328 summary\njudgment where certain fact questions remained. Specifically, appellants assert that the following\nfact questions are in contention: whether the executive holder breached her duty of utmost good\nfaith and fair dealing by obtaining overriding royalties to the exclusion of the non-executives;\nwhether the appellees conspired to obtain assignments of overriding royalties with the intent to\ndefraud the non-executives of their proportionate interest in oil and gas production; and whether\nappellee Edwin V. Acker, Jr. tortiously interfered with appellants' contractual rights.\n\n [5] There can be no breach of duty by the executive receiving an overriding royalty interest where\nthe non-executives are entitled to participate only in a fraction of the production from the property.\nThis is the effect of the holdings in Helms and Tiller. Furthermore, the questions of conspiracy\nand tortious interference of contract become moot, because there can be no conspiracy to deprive\nappellants of an interest which they are not entitled to receive. Nor could Edwin V. Acker, Jr.\nhave interfered tortiously with appellants' contract rights if appellants were not entitled to share\nin more than their proportionate part of four-fifths ( 4 /5) of one-eighth (#) royalty. Point of error\nthree is overruled.\n\nIn their fourth point of error, appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to strike appellees'\ncounterclaims for declaratory relief and request for attorney fees under the Declaratory Judgments\nAct. Appellants assert that the subject matter of the counterclaim was already pending before the\ncourt, and the declaratory relief was sought for the sole purpose of providing a vehicle to obtain\nattorney fees. 2\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (1989)\n\n\n\n\nThe Declaratory Judgments Act is not available to settle disputes already pending before the court.\nJohn Chezik Buick Co. v. Friendly Chevrolet Co., 749 S.W.2d 591, 594 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1988,\nwrit denied). However, when a declaratory judgment counterclaim has greater ramifications than\nthe original suit, the court may allow the counterclaim. See Placid Oil Co. v. Louisiana Gas\nIntrastate, Inc., 734 S.W.2d 1, 5 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n [6] In this case, appellants' lawsuit sought recovery of their alleged proportion of the overriding\nroyalty interests which were assigned to appellees. The counterclaim filed by appellees would\nhave the effect of settling all future disputes as to the granting of royalties under the partition deed.\nThus, the trial court did not err in allowing the appellees' counterclaim to remain on file.\n\n [7] In any event, appellants have failed to preserve this point of error. The trial court signed\na docket control and pre-trial order on February 1, 1988. The trial court set the deadline for\namendments to pleadings by appellants for February 19, 1988. Appellants filed no special\nexceptions to appellees' counterclaim for declaratory relief. Appellants' motion to strike the\ncounterclaim for declaratory relief was filed on or about August 12, 1988. Therefore, on that\nground alone, the trial court was within its discretion in denying appellants' motion. Appellants'\nfourth point of error is overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n781 S.W.2d 322\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.001 et seq.

We withdraw the opinion issued on\nMay 26, 2005, and we issue the following substitute opinion in its place.\n\nAppellees, Bruce L. Jamison and B.L. Jamison Family Limited Partnership (collectively\n“Jamison”), sued appellant XCO Production Company (“XCO”) for breach of a contract governing\nJamison's purchase of an interest in certain oil and gas properties. The parties disagree over the\ninterpretation of the contract. After a jury returned its verdict interpreting the contract in Jamison's\nfavor, the trial court entered judgment for Jamison.\n\nIn three issues, XCO contends (1) the trial court erred by submitting a jury question regarding\ninterpretation of the contract because it is unambiguous and in XCO's favor as a matter of law,\n(2) Jamison's claim is barred by the four-year statute of limitations, and (3) Jamison's claim is\nbarred by a two-year contractual limitations period. We agree that the contract is unambiguous\nas a matter of law, but in Jamison's favor. Therefore, we conclude any error in submitting the\njury question was harmless. We further conclude XCO failed to prove that Jamison's breach of\ncontract claim is barred by the four-year statute of limitations or a contractual limitations period.\nAccordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The company owned working\ninterests in oil and gas properties in Louisiana. Southampton Mineral Corporation was the operator\nfor these properties. In 1991, Jamison, who was interested in a low-risk investment opportunity\nthat would provide tax advantages and future income, was introduced to Gray by one of Jamison's\nfriends.\n\nJamison and XCO entered into a written “Memorandum of Agreement” (“Partnership\nAgreement”) effective December 13, 1991, whereby Jamison purchased a portion of XCO's\nworking interest in several Louisiana properties. The Partnership Agreement created a tax\npartnership (“Partnership”) between Jamison and XCO. 1 Under the Partnership Agreement,\nJamison made a $500,000.00 capital contribution to the partnership, and XCO contributed its\nworking interest in the properties. The disputed portion of the Partnership Agreement, paragraph\n9, concerns allocation of income and costs between XCO and Jamison:\n\n\n   9. Partnership Allocations. Each item of income, gain, loss or deduction shall be allocated\n      between XCO and JAMISON as follows:\n\n            (a) First, all [intangible drilling costs] and general and administrative costs paid from\n               December 13, 1991 through December 31, 1992, shall be allocated to JAMISON,\n               provided, however, that no such amounts shall be allocated to Jamison which would\n               cause his fair market value capital *626 account to become negative or increase its\n               negative position;\n\n            (b) Second, all depreciation with respect to tangibles held by the Tax Partnership or with\n               respect to the Weldon Operating Agreement and allocable to the XCO–JAMISON\n               partnership shall be allocated to JAMISON, provided, however, that such allocations,\n               in the aggregate, shall not cause his fair market value capital account to become\n               negative or increase its negative position;\n\n            (c) All costs other than those set forth in paragraphs 9.a and 9.b of this Memorandum\n               of Agreement shall be allocated to XCO;\n\n            (d) 30% of the XCO–JAMISON Partnership's net revenues, after adjustment for the\n               items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9.a, b and c of this Memorandum of Agreement,\n               shall be allocated to JAMISON until such time as he has received $500,000.00 in\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In summary, XCO claims paragraph 9\nallowed XCO to deduct all costs, including lease operating expenses, intangible drilling costs,\ngeneral and administrative costs, and depreciation, from net revenues to determine Jamison's\nPayout (30% of net revenues). In contrast, Jamison claims XCO could allocate to him only the\ncosts listed in subparagraphs (a) and (b) (intangible drilling costs, general and administrative costs,\nand depreciation); and once $500,000.00 in costs were allocated to him, he was entitled to 30% of\nnet revenues, without regard to costs, until he recouped his initial $500,000.00 investment.\n\nBeginning in 1992, Southampton issued revenue and expense statements to the XCO–Jamison\nPartnership. The statements showed the gross income, taxes, royalties, and operating expenses of\nthe various properties, and the net profit or loss allocable to the aggregated working interests that\npartnered with Southampton in the properties. The statements did not directly show the amounts\nto be billed or credited to the XCO–Jamison Partnership, but instead listed the amounts of “Net\nto XCO” and “Jamison Net Profit.” “Net revenues” to Jamison, as addressed by paragraph 9(d) of\nthe Partnership Agreement, were not addressed by these statements; however, the statements did\nreflect that Southampton deducted expenses from “Jamison Net Profit” which were not included\nin paragraphs 9(a) or 9(b) of the Partnership Agreement.\n\nIn mid–1992, an unrelated lawsuit involving the properties was filed against XCO in Louisiana.\nThe Louisiana court ordered that all XCO's revenues be paid into the registry of the Louisiana\ncourt. The revenues were not released until early 1996. At that time, XCO told Jamison he would\nreceive no money because costs had greatly exceeded revenues.\n\nIn 1999, Jamison sued XCO for breach of contract alleging that XCO failed to pay monies\ndue and improperly charged costs to him. Jamison also alleged the Partnership Agreement was\nambiguous. After hearing the evidence, the trial court determined that the Partnership Agreement\nwas ambiguous and submitted a jury question regarding its meaning. Specifically, *627 the jury\nwas asked, “Did [XCO] and [Jamison] agree that [Jamison] would be paid 30% of net revenues\nafter Jamison's $500,000[.00] investment was expended only on costs allocated to Jamison in\nParagraph 9(a) and 9(b) of the parties' [Partnership] Agreement?” The jury answered “yes,”\nthus interpreting the Partnership Agreement in Jamison's favor. The trial court entered judgment\nawarding Jamison $417,173.00 in actual damages and $111,500.00 in attorneys' fees, as well as\npre-judgment and post-judgment interest.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

INTERPRETATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT\n\n [1] In its first issue, XCO contends the trial court erred in submitting the jury question regarding\ninterpretation of the Partnership Agreement because the contract is unambiguous in XCO's favor\nas a matter of law. 2\n\n\nA. CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACTS\n [2] [3] [4] [5] Our primary concern in interpreting a contract is ascertaining the true intent\nof the parties. Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996); Hewlett–\nPackard Co. v. Benchmark Elecs., Inc., 142 S.W.3d 554, 561 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2004, pet. denied). We examine the writing as a whole in an effort to harmonize and give effect to\nall the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless. Coker v. Coker, 650\nS.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983); Hewlett–Packard, 142 S.W.3d at 561. We presume that the parties\nto a contract intend every clause to have some effect. Heritage Res., 939 S.W.2d at 121. We give\nterms their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning unless the contract shows the parties\nused them in a technical or different sense. Id.\n\n [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] A contract is not ambiguous if it can be given a certain or definite meaning\nas a matter of law. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Renaissance Women's Group, P.A., 121 S.W.3d\n742, 746 (Tex.2003); Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d\n587, 589 (Tex.1996). Lack of clarity does not create an ambiguity. Universal Health Servs.,\n121 S.W.3d at 746; Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 132, 134 (Tex.1994). Further, a\ncontract is not ambiguous simply because the parties advance conflicting interpretations. Columbia\nGas Transmission Corp., 940 S.W.2d at 589; Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 134. Rather, a contract is\nambiguous if it is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations after applying the pertinent\nrules of construction. Universal Health Servs., 121 S.W.3d at 746; Columbia Gas Transmission\nCorp., 940 S.W.2d at 589. If a contract is ambiguous, a fact issue exists on the parties' intent.\nColumbia Gas Transmission Corp., 940 S.W.2d at 589.\n\n [11] In determining whether a contract is ambiguous, we look to the contract as a whole, in light\nof the circumstances present when the contract was executed. Sun Oil Co. (Del.) v. Madeley, 626\nS.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.1981); Mescalero Energy, Inc. v. Underwriters Indem. Gen.

These circumstances include the commonly\nunderstood meaning in the industry of a *628 specialized term, which may be proven by extrinsic\nevidence such as expert testimony or reference material.

Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nZurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Hunt Petroleum (AEC), Inc. 157 S.W.3d 462, 465 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\nDist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\nAccordingly, to determine whether the Partnership Agreement is ambiguous, we first examine the\nwords of the Partnership Agreement, and considering the business activity to be served, determine\nthe meaning of any specialized term as it is interpreted in the industry. We then must decide\nwhether both parties' interpretations are reasonable. If only one reasonable interpretation is offered,\nwe will not find the Partnership Agreement ambiguous, but will enforce the Partnership Agreement\naccording to its terms. After examining the Partnership Agreement and the circumstances present\nwhen it was made, we conclude that XCO's construction is not reasonable, but Jamison's\ninterpretation is reasonable.\n\n\nB. XCO'S INTERPRETATION\nIn support of its argument that only its interpretation is reasonable, XCO points to subparagraph\n9(d) which provides, “30% of the XCO–JAMISON Partnership's net revenues, after adjustment\nfor the items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9.a, b and c ... shall be allocated to\nJAMISON ....” (emphasis added). According to XCO, “after adjustment” means “subtract”; thus,\nall costs, including the costs set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), are to be subtracted from\nnet revenues before determining Jamison's 30% Payout. 3\n\nXCO states that because Jamison purchased a “working interest” in the properties and a “working\ninterest” is a cost-bearing interest, all costs had to be deducted from net revenues for Jamison's\ninterest to be a “working interest.” The court-appointed auditor who examined the Agreement in\nconnection with this suit opined in his report that all costs were to be deducted from net revenues\nto determine Jamison's Payout. This interpretation of subparagraph (d), however, creates several\nconflicts with the rest of paragraph 9. See J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229\n(Tex.2003) (stating that in construing contracts, no single provision taken alone will be given\ncontrolling effect; rather, the court must consider the entire contract to harmonize and give effect\nto all its provisions, so that none will be rendered meaningless).\n\nFirst, under XCO's interpretation, subparagraph (d) conflicts with subparagraphs (a) and (b).\nSubparagraphs (a) and (b) state that certain costs are to be allocated to Jamison's capital account.\nHowever, according to XCO, under subparagraph (d), these same costs are to be subtracted from\nnet revenues to determine Jamison's Payout. Therefore, XCO's interpretation creates a conflict as\nto how the costs are to be treated.\n\nFurther, under XCO's interpretation, subparagraph (d) conflicts with subparagraph (c).\nSubparagraph (c) provides that all costs other than intangible drilling costs, general and\nadministrative costs, and depreciation are to be allocated to XCO. But, subtracting these “other”\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  14\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\ncosts from net revenues to calculate Jamison's Payout, as urged by XCO, would effectively *629\nallocate a portion of these costs to Jamison in contravention of subparagraph (c).\n\nIn addition, under XCO's interpretation, there is no limit on the amount of costs that may be\ndeducted from net revenues to determine Jamison's Payout. That reasoning, however, conflicts\nwith subparagraphs (a) and (b) which provide that “no such amounts shall be allocated to Jamison\nthat would cause his fair market value capital account to become negative or increase its negative\nposition.” Allocating all costs, regardless of amount, to Jamison could cause his capital account\n($500,000.00) to become negative.\n\nFinally, XCO's interpretation does not reconcile the use of the term “net revenues” in subparagraph\n(d) with the use of the term “net profits” in subparagraph (e). According to XCO, under\nsubparagraph (d), all costs are to be subtracted from “net revenues” to determine Jamison's Payout.\nHowever, under subparagraph (e), after Jamison's Payout reaches $500,000.00, he then receives\n1.25% of “net profits.” If “net revenues” include all costs as urged by XCO, then the use of the\nterm “net profits” in subparagraph (e) is rendered meaningless; it would be merely synonymous\nwith “net revenues.” By using different terms, the parties recognized the difference between the\ntwo terms and manifested their intention to treat “net revenue” separately from “net profit.” See\nSun Oil Co., 626 S.W.2d at 728 (where parties used different terms for oil and gas in a lease, it\nwas apparent the parties understood the difference and intended to treat them separately). XCO's\ninterpretation fails to explain how Jamison's interest converts from a “net revenues” interest to a\n“net profits” interest if all costs are already being deducted from “net revenues.”\n\nBecause XCO's interpretation creates several internal conflicts in paragraph 9, we conclude that\nXCO's interpretation is not reasonable.\n\n\nC. JAMISON'S INTERPRETATION\n[12] [13] [14] To substantiate his interpretation of paragraph 9, Jamison relies on the testimony\nof Shelly Cashion, his tax lawyer who drafted the Partnership Agreement. 4 Cashion testified the\nPartnership Agreement was an “odd duck” because it included accounting methodology unique\nto tax partnerships. According to Cashion, in oil and gas taxation, “allocate,” “adjust,” “net\nrevenues,” and “net profits” are terms of art. Cashion defined these terms as follows:\n\n\n   “Allocate ”: means to divide tax items among partners.\n\n         “Adjust ”: is the consequence of that “allocation.” “Adjust” does not mean “subtract” or\n           “deduct.” Rather, tax *630 items are “allocated” to a partner, and the partner's capital\n           account is “adjusted” to account for that “allocation.”\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               15\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n\n         “Net revenues ”: means the cash from oil and gas production minus severance taxes and\n           royalties only.\n\n         “Net profits ”: means “net revenues” minus “lease operating expenses,” which are the\n           operating costs of the business.\n\n   Applying these definitions to paragraph 9, Cashion explained that pursuant to subparagraphs (a)\n      and (b), intangible drilling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation are\n      allocated to Jamison's capital account until his capital account reaches zero. In other words,\n      Jamison receives a total allocation of no more than $500,000.00 in intangible drilling costs,\n      general and administrative expenses, and depreciation. Pursuant to subparagraph (c), all other\n      costs are allocated to XCO's capital account.\nNext, Cashion explained the operation of the disputed subparagraph (d). She testified that the\nphrase “after adjustment for the items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9(a), (b), and (c)” does not\nrequire that all the costs outlined in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) be subtracted from net revenues\nto determine Jamison's Payout. Rather, the phrase is a “timing mechanism.” After these costs\nare allocated to the respective capital accounts pursuant to subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) and\nJamison's capital account reaches zero, Jamison receives 30% of net revenues until he recoups\nhis $500,000.00 capital contribution. Thus, Jamison does not receive a percentage of net revenues\nuntil his capital account is exhausted. Further, because the term “net revenues” is used, Jamison\nreceives 30% of net revenues without regard to costs, including lease operating expenses. In sum,\nthe Partnership spends Jamison's $500,000.00, then pays Jamison a percentage of net revenues\nuntil Jamison's initial $500,000.00 is repaid in full.\n\nCashion then stated that pursuant to subparagraph (e), once Jamison recoups his $500,000.00, his\ninterest would convert to receiving 1.25% of “net profits,” which means he is then charged with\na proportionate share of all costs, including lease operating expenses.\n\nWe conclude Cashion's explanation of paragraph 9 is reasonable because, inter alia, her definitions\nof “allocate” and “adjustment” resolve any conflicts between the subparagraphs. Further,\nCashion's distinction between “net revenues” and “net profits” explains the parties' decision to\nuse the term “net revenues” in subparagraph (d), and “net profits” in subparagraph (e). 5 It is also\nconsistent with the *631 way in which tax partnerships use those terms, and with Gray's own use\nof the terms in negotiating the Partnership Agreement.\n\nJamison's interpretation is also consistent with the circumstances existing when the contract was\nexecuted and the “particular business activity” to be served. See Hewlett–Packard, 142 S.W.3d\nat 561 (“We construe a contract from a utilitarian standpoint, bearing in mind the particular\nbusiness activity sought to be served”). It is undisputed that, from the outset of their relationship,\nJamison consistently represented to Gray that he wanted a low-risk investment with maximum tax\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 16\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nadvantages and an opportunity to get his capital back. In return, Jamison was willing to receive\nonly a small percentage of the net profits over the long term. If the parties had agreed that revenues\ncould be reduced by all potential costs before calculating Jamison's Payout, as urged by XCO,\nJamison's investment would not have been low-risk.\n\nThe most significant evidence of the circumstances present when the contract was made is a letter\nfrom Gray to Jamison outlining XCO's proposal. Gray stated that XCO anticipated incurring a\ncertain amount of general and administrative costs and intangible drilling costs in a short time\nperiod with respect to the properties. Gray proposed that Jamison “reimburse” XCO for these\ncosts. Gray also proposed that Jamison\n\n            would receive a defined percentage of XCO's monthly production revenues\n            on a preferential basis computed without regard to expense. After [Jamison]\n            had recouped the value of his investment, his interest in the partnership would\n            convert to a ‘net profits interest’ such that he would receive a significantly\n            reduced percentage of the net profits attributable to the partnership.\n\n(emphasis added). 6 This proposal is consistent with Jamison's argument that only certain costs\nwere to be allocated to him; then, he would recoup his investment out of net revenues without\nregard to operating costs before his interest converted to a net profits interest. 7\n\nNevertheless, Gray testified that the portion of his proposal offering to return Jamison's investment\n“on a preferential basis computed without regard to expense” was not embodied in the final\nPartnership Agreement. According to Gray, Cashion and XCO's tax lawyer advised him that his\nproposal could not be utilized because it created, in effect, a cost-less interest that would not allow\nJamison any tax deductions.\n\nAt trial, however, Cashion explained her concerns with the initial proposal. She stated that Gray's\nproposal would result in Jamison's immediately recouping his investment out of net revenues.\nCashion feared the IRS might view such an arrangement as a loan, rather than an investment,\nand thus disallow any deductions. Therefore, she and XCO's tax attorney decided to draft the\nPartnership *632 Agreement so as to postpone Jamison's participation in net revenues until\nhis investment had been exhausted through allocation of the costs outlined in subparagraphs (a)\nand (b). 8 Therefore, Gray's proposal that Jamison recoup his investment on a “on a preferential\nbasis computed without regard to expense” was embodied in the final Partnership Agreement.\nHowever, Cashion's tax concerns were alleviated by modifying the timing for Jamison to recoup\nhis investment. 9\n\n[15] In sum, Jamison's interpretation is reasonable because it reconciles the subparagraphs of\nparagraph 9 and is consistent with the circumstances present when the Partnership Agreement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nwas made and the particular business activity to be served. Because the Partnership Agreement is\nsubject to only one reasonable interpretation, it is unambiguous as a matter of law. See Universal\nHealth Servs., Inc., 121 S.W.3d at 746; Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 940 S.W.2d at 589.\nTherefore, the trial court erred in submitting a jury question regarding interpretation of the\nPartnership Agreement. See Transcon. Gas Pipeline Corp. v. Texaco, Inc., 35 S.W.3d 658, 665\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. denied) (stating that a trial court errs when it does not\nconstrue an unambiguous provision as a matter of law, and instead, submits the issue to a fact\nfinder). However, the error is harmless because the jury interpreted the Partnership Agreement in\nJamison's favor. See TEX.R.APP. P. 44.1(a)(1); see also Med. Towers, Ltd. v. St. Luke's Episcopal\nHosp., 750 S.W.2d 820, 826 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1988, writ denied) (absent a showing\nof some prejudice, submission of a question of law to the jury is harmless since the trial court can\nalways use the jury's findings as advisory only). Accordingly, we overrule XCO's first issue.\n\n\n\n                         III. FOUR–YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\nIn its second issue, XCO contends that Jamison's breach of contract claim was barred by the four-\nyear statute of limitations as a matter of law. See TEX. CIV.

Warner Communication\nInc., 826 S.W.2d 638, 640 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, no writ). The court determines\nwhat conduct is required by the parties, and, insofar as a dispute exists concerning the failure of\na party to perform the contract, the court submits the disputed fact questions to the jury. Meek v.\nBishop, Peterson & Sharp, P.C., 919 S.W.2d 805, 808 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ\ndenied). Where reasonable minds may differ as to the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, it is\nincumbent upon the party asserting limitations to secure findings sustaining the plea of limitations.\nIntermedics, Inc. v. Grady, 683 S.W.2d 842, 845 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). The failure to request a jury instruction on an affirmative defense results in waiver of that\nground by the party relying on it unless the issue was conclusively established. See TEX.R.

Zimmerman, 160 S.W.3d 695, 702 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (the party asserting\nan affirmative defense has the burden of pleading and proving its elements). XCO argues that\nJamison's cause of action accrued “when XCO allegedly breached the contract by deducting\nmore than $500,000.00 in workover costs when calculating net revenue.” XCO alleges that if a\nbreach occurred, it occurred “when XCO sent Jamison the February and March 1993 [accounting]\nstatements.”\n\nJamison responds that these statements do not prove the breach of contract occurred in 1993\nfor several reasons, including (1) Jamison's receipt of erroneous accounting statements by\nSouthampton does not constitute a breach of contract by XCO, particularly where XCO admits\nthat the statements are erroneous; (2) XCO did not refuse to pay Jamison's share of net revenues in\nFebruary 1993 because the revenues were frozen by a court, and therefore, XCO either had no “net\nrevenue,” or if it did, the distributions were not due and payable while they were sequestered by\ncourt order; (3) the time for performance was extended by XCO's reassurances that Southampton's\nstatements were erroneous, and that the accounting would be corrected and funds distributed after\nthe funds were released from the court; (4) XCO admits that the accounting statements contain\nerrors; (5) Southampton's 1993 account statements could amount to no more than an anticipatory\nbreach by XCO, and the statute of limitations begins to run on a promisor's breach/repudiation of\na contract only if the repudiation is adopted by the non-repudiating party; and (6) even if a breach\noccurred in 1993, the statute of limitations was tolled while the funds were held in the registry\nof the court.\n\n\n1. Southampton's Statements Are Not Attributable to XCO.\nXCO is not only the appellant, but also bore the burden of proof to establish its limitations defense\nat trial; we therefore address its argument first.\n\nXCO contends that to the extent it breached the contract, the breach occurred when XCO sent\nJamison accounting statements in 1993 that allegedly demonstrated XCO's improper deduction\nof expenses from Jamison's account; but, Jamison correctly points out that the statements relied\nupon by XCO were actually issued by Southampton to the XCO–Jamison Partnership. XCO\nresponds that Southampton's accounting statements to the Partnership constitute XCO's statements\nto Jamison because the Partnership Agreement states that Southampton is the Operator, and\nbecause XCO's president is also the president of Southampton. Additionally, XCO points out that\nSouthampton's office address shown on the statements is the same as XCO's office address.\n\n [22] Texas law presumes that two separate corporations are distinct entities, and “a party seeking\nto ascribe one corporation's actions to another by disregarding their distinct corporate entities\nmust prove this allegation.” *634 BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789,\n798 (Tex.2002). Although XCO's arguments on appeal treat the two entities as one, none of the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                19\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nparties took the position in their pleadings or at trial that XCO and Southampton are constructively\nthe same entity, nor was the jury asked to find that either company owned, controlled, or\ndominated the other. 10 The Partnership Agreement also treats XCO and Southampton as separate\nentities. Moreover, Southampton's statements to the Partnership do not purport to represent XCO's\naccounting of the intra-Partnership allocations required by the Partnership Agreement. 11 The\nstatements bear no indication that they were prepared by XCO, make no mention of the Partnership\nAgreement, do not report on XCO and Jamison's capital accounts, and do not perform the\ncalculations required by the Partnership Agreement.\n\n [23] [24] We further note that a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run\nwhen facts come into existence that authorize a party to seek a judicial remedy. Johnson & Higgins\nof Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 514 (Tex.1998). Stated another way, a\ncause of action can generally be said to accrue when the wrongful act effects an injury, regardless\nof when the plaintiff learned of such injury. Moreno v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 787 S.W.2d 348,\n351 (Tex.1990). Even assuming that Jamison could have complained of errors in Southampton's\nstatements, we are aware of no authority to support the proposition that Southampton's statements\ntriggered Jamison's right to a judicial remedy against XCO. The statements were not prepared\npursuant to or in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and imply nothing regarding XCO's\nintent to abide by its terms. Moreover, XCO did not claim that Southampton's statements were\ncorrect; to the contrary, XCO admitted that the statements contained errors. XCO did not represent\nto Jamison that it would adopt the Southampton's accounting conclusions; to the contrary, XCO\nrepresented that it would correct the accounting statements and pay Jamison the net revenue due\nhim when the funds were released from the Louisiana court. Finally, XCO has not shown that\nSouthampton's erroneous statements injured Jamison. See Southwell v. Univ. of the Incarnate\nWord, 974 S.W.2d 351, 354–55 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1998, pet. denied) (to prove an action for\nbreach of contract, the plaintiff must establish the defendant's breach caused injury). Under these\ncircumstances, Southampton's statements would not have supported a breach of contract claim by\nJamison against XCO.\n\n *635 However, our analysis does not end here. Because the arguments and evidence adduced by\nJamison offer independent grounds for affirmance, we address those as well.\n\n\n2. XCO Did Not Refuse to Pay Net Revenue Before 1996.\nJamison contends that XCO's failure to pay Jamison in 1993–1995 was not the result of a breach of\ncontract, but was instead caused by the Louisiana court's retention of the funds from 1992 until the\nearly part of 1996. Specifically, Jamison claims that prior to 1996, XCO did not refuse to pay net\nrevenues that were “due and payable” because (a) there was no refusal to pay, (b) there was no net\nrevenue, and (c) if there was net revenue, it was not “due and payable” until released by the court.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                20\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nXCO argues that Southampton's accounting statements should have alerted Jamison that XCO\nwould not pay Jamison in accordance with the Partnership Agreement; however, both Jamison\nand Gray testified that the first time Gray or any of XCO's representatives ever told Jamison or\nany of Jamison's representatives that Jamison would not be paid was between January and March\nof 1996. According to Jamison, while the revenues were frozen, XCO reassured Jamison that he\nwould receive his Payout when the revenues were released. Specifically, Jamison testified without\ncontradiction that while the revenues were frozen, he asked Gray periodically about the status of\nthe Louisiana suit. Gray responded that the suit was going well and said, “don't worry [,] your\nmoney is in there. Once we wrap this up, you're going to get your money. You are due your money,\nyour net revenue.” Jamison also testified that during 1992, he addressed with Gray whether his\n$500,000.00 investment was being properly allocated. Gray responded that XCO's accounting was\na “mess,” and “we really don't know whether it is expended or not expended or whatever, but it\ndoesn't matter because you're ... going to get paid on this anyway because you're going to get your\n$500,000[.00].” Thus, the first “refusal to pay” occurred in 1996, fewer than four years before\nJamison filed suit.\n\nMoreover, the existence and extent of “net revenue” available to the Partnership is a question of\nfact that was not presented to the jury. Because XCO claimed Jamison's suit was time-barred,\nXCO bore the burden to obtain findings of fact necessary to support this affirmative defense.\nHaving failed to do so, we cannot say that Jamison's cause of action accrued during a time when\nnet revenues were not proven. 12\n\n*636 [25] In sum, we conclude XCO did not prove as a matter of law that Jamison's claim\naccrued more than four years before Jamison filed suit. 13\n\n\n\n                         IV. CONTRACTUAL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n [26] In its third issue, XCO contends that Jamison's breach of contract claim was also barred by a\ncontractual time limitations clause. This argument was raised for the first time in XCO's motion for\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict. Although an answer filed jointly by XCO, Robert Gray, and\nSouthampton asserts that “any claims for an accounting are restricted by the applicable limitations\nperiod of the Joint Operating Agreements attached to the [Partnership Agreement],” XCO did not\nassert that the agreements between Southampton and the non-operators barred Jamison's claim\nthat XCO breached its Partnership Agreement with Jamison.\n\nThe Partnership Agreement gives Jamison a part of XCO's share in the Lake Boeuf Operating\nAgreement, the Weldon Operating Agreement, and the Lake Boeuf Tax Partnership (collectively,\nthe “Operating Agreements”). The terms of each of these Operating Agreements, “except to\nthe extent expressly inconsistent [with the Partnership Agreement],” are incorporated into the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               21\n\fXCO Production Co. v. Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\nPartnership Agreement. The Operating Agreements incorporate the “Accounting Procedure and\nJoint Operations” agreement (“APJO Agreement”) between Southampton, as the operator, and the\nnon-operator parties to the Operating Agreements. The APJO Agreement addresses Southampton's\nstatements and billings to non-operators, and provides in pertinent part:\n\n            [A]ll bills and statements rendered to Non–Operators by Operator during any\n            calendar year shall conclusively be presumed to be true and correct after twenty-\n            four (24) months following the end of any such calendar year, unless within the\n            said twenty-four month period a Non–Operator takes written exception thereto\n            and makes claim on Operator for adjustment.\n\nAccording to XCO, this provision imposed a two-year limitations period for Jamison to sue XCO\nregarding improper deductions from net revenues during a given year. We disagree.\n\nThis provision applies to accounting procedures between the operator and the non-operators.\nSouthampton is the operator for these properties; XCO and other entities were the non-operators.\nJamison purchased a portion of XCO's non-operator interest in the properties under a separate\nPartnership Agreement, and his dispute is with XCO over the terms of that Partnership Agreement.\nJamison's dispute is not with Southampton. In short, this dispute is not between the operator and\na non-operator. Rather, this dispute is between two partners who together constitute a single non-\noperator. Therefore, this provision does not impose a two-year contractual limitations period on\nJamison with respect *637 to his breach of contract claim against XCO. 14 We overrule XCO's\nthird issue.\n\n\n\n                                            V. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, we hold the Partnership Agreement is unambiguous as a matter of law, but in Jamison's\nfavor. We further hold that XCO failed to prove that Jamison's breach of contract claim was barred\nby the four-year statute of limitations or a contractual limitations period. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n194 S.W.3d 622, 163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n1     XCO and Jamison were considered partners for federal income taxation purposes only. They were not considered partners with\n      respect to liabilities and obligations under state law. Jamison's tax attorney testified that the federal government permits this type of\n      arrangement to stimulate oil and gas investment.\n2     In its brief, XCO frames its first issue in several different ways. However, the theme of its complaint is that the trial court erred in\n      submitting the jury question because the Partnership Agreement is unambiguous as a matter of law. XCO does not challenge the\n      sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding.\n3     According to XCO, these costs include all lease operating expenses, in addition to intangible drilling costs, general and administrative\n      costs, and depreciation. The lease operating expenses are at the center of this dispute. There is evidence that lease operating expenses\n      are the primary type of other costs addressed in subparagraph (c). Further, XCO deducted large amounts of lease operating expenses\n      from net revenues pursuant to its interpretation of the Partnership Agreement.\n4     XCO contends that Cashion's testimony, as well as all evidence regarding the parties' intent, is inadmissible parol evidence. Extrinsic\n      evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity or vary the terms of an unambiguous agreement; however, when determining\n      whether an agreement is ambiguous, we may examine extrinsic evidence to interpret the terms used by the parties and extrinsic\n      evidence of the circumstances surrounding execution of the agreement. See Balandran v. Safeco Inc. Co. of Am., 972 S.W.2d 738,\n      741 (Tex.1998); Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 (Tex.1995); Sun Oil Co., 626\n      S.W.2d at 731. Expert testimony may be particularly useful in explaining the “commonly understood meaning in the industry of a\n      specialized term.” Mescalero, 56 S.W.3d at 320, 323; Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 157 S.W.3d at 465. Jamison offered the testimony of Ms.\n      Cashion, as well as the testimony of its expert who reviewed the Partnership Agreement in connection with this suit for this purpose.\n      XCO also offered the report of the court-appointed auditor, who agreed with XCO's interpretation. This evidence was not admitted\n      to create an ambiguity or to vary the terms of the Partnership Agreement, but to explain its specialized terms.\n5     XCO has not offered a contrary definition for the terms used in the Partnership Agreement that is reasonable. In his report, the\n      court-appointed auditor stated that a “net revenues” interest is substantially the same as a “net profits” interest for purposes of this\n      Partnership Agreement. This fails to explain the use of the two different terms in subparagraphs (d) and (e). Further, the auditor stated\n      that his audit was based on Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies (COPAS) principles. Jamison's expert testified that COPAS\n      explicitly defines “net revenues” as gross proceeds less royalties and severance taxes; and COPAS explicitly defines “net profits” as\n      gross proceeds less royalties, severance taxes, and operating expenses. In fact, later in his report, the auditor seems to acknowledge\n      that the terms are not the same. In particular, the auditor later summarizes the partnership's revenues, costs, and Jamison's interest. The\n      auditor has two separate categories entitled: “Net Revenues allocated to Jamison (per paragraph 9d of the [Partnership Agreement] )”\n      and “Net Profit Interest (per paragraph 9e of the [Partnership Agreement] ).” With respect to the latter category, the auditor notes\n      that the net profit interest “[i]s not applicable until such time that the Net Revenue distribution reaches $500,000[.00].”\n6     Gray attached a pro forma projecting production from the properties on a monthly basis and Jamison's corresponding potential return\n      on his investment. Gray proposed two alternatives based on Jamison's contribution of $500,000.00 or $1 million. The pro forma\n      shows Jamison's potential return under both scenarios. Under both scenarios, Jamison's return is 30% of net revenues without regard\n      to expenses.\n7     Craig Crawford, Jamison's friend who introduced him to Gray, testified that Gray outlined a general proposal during their initial\n      meetings. Gray represented that Jamison would be given “preferential treatment” on the “front end” until he recouped $500,000.00;\n      Jamison would then receive a smaller residual interest on the “tail end.”\n8     XCO's tax attorney did not testify, and, thus, did not controvert Cashion's explanation.\n\n9     Cashion also testified regarding two other changes between the proposal and final Partnership Agreement, as well as a subsequent\n      amendment. However, these changes and amendment are not pertinent to this dispute.\n10    Robert Gray owns 100% of XCO and 50% of Southampton. Although Jamison alleged that Gray was the alter ego of XCO and\n      Southampton, the allegation was denied by Gray, XCO, and Southampton.\n11    For example, Southampton's February 1993 accounting statement lists the gross revenue, taxes, royalties and operating expenses\n      associated with the various properties, and from these figures, calculates the “net to working interests.” The statement then lists “net\n      to XCO” and “Jamison net profit,” though it is undisputed that Jamison had not received $500,000.00 in distributions at this time. In\n      contrast, the Partnership Agreement requires the calculation of Jamison's net revenue—not net profit—until he receives $500,000.00\n      in distributions. Thus, Southampton's calculation of “Jamison net profit” is not the equivalent of XCO's required calculation of\n      Jamison's net revenue. This particular statement also indicates that a “workover” expense of $869,700.00 for the St. Charles Church\n      well was charged against the “net to working interests” and deducted in part from both “net to XCO” and “Jamison net profit.”\n      Southampton therefore lists “Jamison net profit” as a negative number, despite the fact that Jamison had not reached “Payout” and\n      his interest had not yet converted from net revenue to net profit.\n12    Jamison additionally argues that, under the doctrine of impossibility, a party prevented by a government order from performing his\n      contractual obligation is excused. See Centex Corp. v. Dalton, 840 S.W.2d 952, 954 (Tex.1992). Reasoning that it was impossible for\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jamison, 194 S.W.3d 622 (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n      XCO to distribute Jamison's net revenue while it was held in the registry of the court, Jamison argues that the statute of limitations\n      should therefore be tolled as well. XCO responds that this proposition has never been part of the law of limitations. But see Fed.\n      Trust Co. v. Brand, 76 S.W.2d 142, 144 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1934, writ ref'd.) (“It is settled law in Texas and elsewhere, so far\n      as we have been able to ascertain, that limitation does not run while property is in the custody of the law.”); see also Madeksho v.\n      Abraham, Watkins, Nichols & Friend, 112 S.W.3d 679, 688 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (en banc) (per Brister,\n      C.J., with three justices concurring and one justice concurring in result only) (“funds in the registry of the court are held in custodia\n      legis, and thus exempt from claims by third parties. There is no point in requiring an earlier interpleader if no one can file claims\n      to the funds until after the mandate issues and the funds are released.”) (emphasis added). Because the existence and extent of “net\n      revenue” due to Jamison were not determined at trial, we do not reach this issue.\n13    XCO also asserts that the trial court erred by submitting a jury question that asked if, prior to July 30, 1995 (i.e., four years before suit),\n      Jamison discovered or should have discovered facts causing him to believe he had a claim for breach of the Partnership Agreement.\n      The jury answered, “no.” Because XCO failed to prove that Jamison's cause of action accrued more than four years before suit,\n      the discovery rule is inapplicable. However, submission of the jury question was harmless, because XCO did not establish that a\n      breach of the Partnership Agreement occurred before July 30, 1995. See also City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750,\n      752 (Tex.1995) (“Submission of an improper jury question can be harmless error if the jury's answers to other questions render the\n      improper question immaterial.”).\n14    On appeal, XCO contends for the first time that this limitations provision applies to accounting disputes between XCO and Jamison\n      because Gray was an officer of both XCO and Southampton, Southampton issued Jamison's checks, and Southampton sent Jamison\n      accounting statements from the same address as XCO. These facts do not change the terms of the Operating Agreements or the\n      APJO Agreement. Those agreements state, and XCO admits, that Southampton is the operator. This limitations provision governs\n      accounting between the operator and non-operator. It does not impose a limitations period on Jamison's suit against XCO.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court erred in granting Murphy’s motion for\nsummary judgment, which allows Murphy to satisfy its\nobligation to drill an offset well simply by drilling a well\nanywhere on the Herbst Leases.\n\n2.    The district court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s\nfees on appeal because (a) the district court had no authority to\naward fees and (b) the award was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                               vii\n\f                       SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      An offset well is a “well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the\n\ndrainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a well is being\n\ndrilled or is already in production.” Williams & Meyers’ Manual of Oil and\n\nGas Terms, p. 718 (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\nleases (“Leases”) provides that, if a well is drilled on adjacent lands and\n\nwithin 467 feet of the leased premises, the lessee must either drill an offset\n\nwell, release sufficient acreage adjacent to the draining well to allow the\n\nLessor to drill an offset well, or pay compensatory royalty. Murphy drilled\n\na well on the Leases over 2,100 feet from the draining well and contends it\n\nis an “offset well” under Paragraph 25. Such a well does not qualify as an\n\noffset well under Paragraph 25.\n\n      Murphy argues that a well drilled anywhere on the leased premises\n\nsatisfies its obligation under Paragraph 25, as long as the well is completed\n\nin the same formation as the draining well. This argument deprives the\n\nword “offset” of any meaning and ignores the plain language and intent of\n\nParagraph 25, which is to protect the leased premises from drainage.\n\n      Murphy also argues that the well on the adjacent land is not in fact\n\ndraining the leased premises. There is no evidence in the record to support\n\n                                      1\n\fthat contention.   More to the point, Paragraph 25 does not require the\n\nLessor to prove that the well is draining the leased premises. The very\n\npurpose of Paragraph 25 is to eliminate the need for that proof.\n\n      The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorneys’ fees on appeal,\n\nbased on its counterclaim for declaratory judgment.

The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Murphy.\n      (Issue One)\n\n      The district court erred in holding that Murphy’s drilling of a well\n\nmore than 2,100 feet from a well on adjacent property satisfies Murphy’s\n\nobligation to drill an offset well under its Leases with the Herbsts.\n\n      A.    Murphy’s interpretation of Paragraph 25 of the Leases renders\n            the term “offset” meaningless.\n\n      Murphy asserts (at 4) that the Leases “give[] the operator discretion\n\nover when and where to drill” and, therefore, Murphy has the discretion to\n\nlocate an offset well anywhere on the leased premises. Nothing in the\n\nLeases says this. Murphy’s interpretation of the Leases to allow the lessee\n\n                                       2\n\fto locate the offset well anywhere on the leased premises renders the word\n\n“offset” a meaningless, redundant term. As the Herbsts pointed out in\n\ntheir initial brief (at 14), omit the word “offset” from Paragraph 25 and\n\nMurphy’s interpretation would be reasonable. Murphy fails to address\n\neither this point or the basic rule of construction that all words in the\n\nLeases are to be given effect. See State Farm Lloyds v.

App.—\n\nAmarillo 2004, no pet.) (mem. op.) (declining to interpret different words to\n\nhave the same meaning).        The Court should reject the trial court’s\n\nacceptance of Murphy’s argument that any “well” is an “offset well.”\n\n      B.    Murphy’s attempts to justify giving no meaning to the term\n            “offset” violate basic rules of contract construction.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 10) that the word “such” in Paragraph 25 justifies\n\nnot giving any meaning to the term “offset.” Murphy asserts that, because\n\nthe word “such” appears before the word “offset,” the phrase “such offset\n\nwell” must be an “internal cross-reference to ‘drilling operations on the\n\nleased acreage.’” Murphy then makes the further leap to say that this\n\n“internal cross-reference” must mean that any drilling operations anywhere\n\non the Leases satisfies the duty to drill an offset well.     This contorted\n\nreading of Paragraph 25 is contrary to the rules of construction cited above\n\nand is not reasonable. Nothing in the word “such” indicates an intent to\n\n\n                                      4\n\frender the word “offset” meaningless.        The word “such” is simply a\n\nreference to the “offset well” that must be drilled.\n\n      In another attempt to justify ignoring the term “offset,” Murphy\n\nargues (at 10) that drilling to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n\nsatisfies the “ordinary and industry” meaning of the term “offset” because\n\ndrilling a well to that depth serves as a “counterbalance” or a “[s]et off as\n\nan equivalent against.” The depth requirement in the Leases, however, is\n\nan additional vertical requirement beyond the horizontal offsetting distance\n\nrequirement. Drilling a well to the same vertical depth as the triggering\n\nwell but locating that well 2,100 feet or several miles away could not\n\npossibly “offset” the triggering well. Moreover, the duty to drill to this\n\nvertical depth still exists if one deletes the word “offset” from Paragraph\n\n25. Therefore, this reading of Paragraph 25 continues to render the term\n\n“offset” meaningless.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 9) that Paragraph 25(3), which gives Murphy the\n\noption to release acreage instead of drilling, supports Murphy’s claim that\n\nit can drill the offset well anywhere it wants because Paragraph 25(3) does\n\nnot define the acreage that must be released. Paragraph 25(3) supports the\n\nHerbsts’ construction of the offset requirement, not Murphy’s. Paragraph\n                                       5\n\f25(3) specifies that the acreage released must be “sufficient to constitute a\n\nspacing unit equivalent in size to the spacing unit that would be allocated\n\nunder this lease to such well or wells on the adjacent lands.” SCR 155, 166\n\n(emphasis added). “Adjacent” means “[c]lose to,” “lying near,” “[n]ext to”\n\nor “adjoining.” THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY at 21 (5th ed. 2011).\n\nParagraph 25(3) plainly requires Murphy to release acreage “next to” the\n\nlands where the triggering well is located. The provision also requires the\n\nacreage to be in a sufficient amount to allow the Herbsts or their new lessee\n\nto drill a well in compliance with Railroad Commission (“RRC”) spacing\n\nrules. Murphy’s suggestion that it could release acreage on the far side of\n\nthe leased premises and satisfy this provision only highlights the\n\nunreasonableness of its interpretation.\n\n      C.    The Herbsts are not rewriting the Leases but are, instead,\n            giving Paragraph 25 its only reasonable, utilitarian result.\n\n      The Herbsts are not, as Murphy alleges (at 11), trying to rewrite the\n\nLeases or add terms that are not there. Instead, the Herbsts give meaning\n\nto all of the words that are there.\n\n      Murphy asserts (at 9) that the Leases could have included a specific\n\ndistance limitation and the fact that they do not must mean that Murphy\n\n\n                                      6\n\fcan locate the well anywhere on the leased premises. The absence of a\n\nspecific distance limitation is reasonable and readily explained.           By\n\navoiding a specific distance limitation, the Leases properly grant the lessee\n\nsome flexibility in locating the offset well.\n\n      The Herbsts’ recognition that Murphy has some flexibility in locating\n\nthe offset well does not, as Murphy claims (at 9), constitute the creation of a\n\n“per se unreasonable” “moving-target distance.”        On the contrary, this\n\nconcession recognizes the practicalities inherent in locating a well. There\n\ncould be a pipeline or a habitable structure or some other obstacle situated\n\nnext to the lease line. Paragraph 7 of the Leases prohibits drilling a well\n\n“nearer than 200 feet to the house or barn now on said land” without the\n\nlandowner’s consent. SCR 152, 163. These potential circumstances could\n\nimpact how closely Murphy would be able to locate the well to the lease\n\nline. Giving the lessee “an inch” of flexibility to address potential obstacles\n\nto drilling, however, does not equate to giving the lessee permission to take\n\n“a mile.” That is precisely the unreasonable position Murphy takes here.\n\nUnder Murphy’s reasoning, a lessee with these provisions on a 25,000 acre\n\nlease could locate an offset well many miles from the well triggering the\n\nduty to offset. That makes no sense.\n                                         7\n\f     Murphy further argues (at 11-12) that imposing any range of\n\ndistances for an offset well equates to implying terms the parties did not\n\nagree to. On the contrary, interpreting Paragraph 25 to require Murphy to\n\nplace the well in close proximity to the triggering well is not rewriting the\n\nLeases: it is giving meaning to the term “offset” and fulfilling the purposes\n\nof Paragraph 25 to protect against any presumed drainage.\n\n     Courts do not rewrite contracts but they also do not interpret them in\n\na way that renders them “unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.”\n\nSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v.

Courts “construe contracts ‘from a utilitarian\n\nstandpoint bearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be\n\nserved.’” Id. The only reasonable, utilitarian interpretation of Paragraph\n\n25 is to require an offset well to be close to the well it is supposed to\n\n“offset.” How close will depend on the particular circumstances on the\n\nleased premises. But drilling a well over 2,100 feet – or 20 miles – from the\n\ntriggering well is not reasonable and would not serve the issues addressed\n\nin Paragraph 25. Murphy’s claims (at 3-4) that it could make more money\n\nby drilling the well where it did serves none of the objectives of Paragraph\n                                      8\n\f25.   The Herbsts’ construction of Paragraph 25 “is the only plausible\n\nconstruction.” Springer Ranch, 421 S.W.3d at 286.\n\n      The issue in this case is not how close to the adjacent well Murphy’s\n\noffset well must be located. The issue is whether, by drilling a well over\n\n2,100 feet from the adjacent well, Murphy satisfied its obligations under\n\nParagraph 25. No reasonable construction of Paragraph 25 would support\n\nMurphy’s argument that its well, more than 2,100 feet away, is an “offset\n\nwell” under Paragraph 25.\n\n      Murphy cites (at 9) Americo Life, Inc. v.

What the parties said here was\n\nthat a well Murphy drilled to comply with Paragraph 25 had to be an\n\n“offset well.” The parties did not say that Murphy could drill a “well”\n\nanywhere it chose and still comply with Paragraph 25.\n\n      D.    Murphy’s expert affidavit, on which it based its motion for\n            summary judgment, does not support the trial court’s\n            decision.\n\n      In the trial court, Murphy contended that extrinsic testimony from its\n\nexpert was necessary support for its summary judgment motion.

SCR 123. In\n\ntheir initial brief, the Herbsts explained (at 28-34) the many flaws in the\n\naffidavit from Murphy’s expert, whose opinion was based on a misreading\n\nof RRC rules, orders, and form and his own ipse dixit. The Herbsts also set\n\nout the law that opinion testimony generally raises only a question of fact.\n\nSee Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

Moreover, the\ntrial court granted Murphy’s motion, which relied heavily on the affidavit as the centerpiece of\nits argument. Murphy’s suggestion that the trial court ruled for it without regard to Murphy’s\nkey argument is without any support in the record.\n                                              10\n\fthe Eagle Ford Shale and therefore “no reason to drill a well near the lease\n\nline.” See Br. at 11 (citing SCR 177). Murphy suggests (at 11) that it is\n\nproper to rely on its expert for this claim so that it can show the Herbsts’\n\n“profound misunderstanding of the characteristics of horizontal shale wells\n\nand the commercial context of the Leases.”\n\n      Murphy’s expert does not actually say there is “little to no drainage,”\n\nand does not address drainage specific to the oil and gas under the leased\n\npremises at all.   No actual testing was ever conducted with respect to\n\ndrainage of these leased premises. He says that the RRC “assigned lease\n\nline spacing rules that reflect” that “a relatively modest amount of reservoir\n\nis drained by each horizontal well.” SCR 177. Murphy’s expert further\n\nstates that “[e]arly indications” of recent “pilot programs” are that wells\n\nmay be located “as close as 225 feet” without drainage. SCR 177.\n\n      Murphy’s reliance on these statements to show the “commercial\n\ncontext” of the Leases is mistaken. The relevant commercial context for the\n\nLeases is the commercial context “in which the contract was negotiated.”\n\nSee Kachina Pipeline Co. v. Lillis, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 13,0596, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5889109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3 (Tex. October 9, 2015) (stating court may consider “the\n\ncommercial or other setting in which the contract was negotiated”). These\n                                      11\n\fstatements by Murphy’s expert, made in 2014, have nothing to do with the\n\ncommercial context at the time the Leases were negotiated in 2009.\n\nMurphy’s expert speaks to what he claims is known about the Eagle Ford\n\nfield as of 2014, not what was known in 2009, when the Leases were signed.\n\n      The commercial context when the parties executed these Leases in\n\n2009 was exactly what Paragraph 25 indicates it was – a concern that\n\ndrainage might occur if wells were drilled on neighboring tracts within 467\n\nfeet of the lease line. The RRC did not have special “lease line spacing\n\nrules” for the Eagle Ford in 2009 but instead, had the spacing rule that\n\nformed the basis for the offset well drilling requirement in the Leases – i.e.,\n\n467 feet. Those RRC rules, which reduced from the standard 467 feet to 330\n\nfeet the well spacing distance from the lease line – a spacing requirement\n\ndesigned to protect against drainage – were not adopted until more than a\n\nyear later, in November of 2010. Even then, the RRC adopted them only as\n\ntemporary rules until the RRC could acquire more information about the\n\nEagle Ford field. SCR 88-92. The RRC did not make these spacing rules\n\npermanent until almost two years later, in 2012. SCR 93-97. The pilot\n\nprojects that Murphy’s expert also relies on for his statements regarding\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\fthe risk of drainage in the Eagle Ford similarly did not exist in 2009 when\n\nthe Leases were executed.\n\n      Finally, Murphy misses the point that the purpose of Paragraph 25\n\nwas to eliminate any requirement that the Lessor prove drainage from the\n\nadjacent well in order to trigger the Lessee’s obligation to drill an offset\n\nwell. The Lessee’s obligations under Paragraph 25 were triggered by the\n\ndrilling of a well within 467 feet of the lease line. Murphy then had the\n\noption to either drill an offset well, release sufficient acreage adjacent to the\n\ndraining well to allow an offset well to be drilled, or pay compensatory\n\nroyalty. The parties agreed that no proof of actual drainage by the adjacent\n\nwell was necessary to trigger the Lessee’s obligations.\n\n      E.    Industry understanding supports the Herbsts’ interpretation\n            of Paragraph 25.\n\n      On page 16 of its brief, Murphy suggests the Herbsts opposed this\n\nCourt’s    consideration   of   industry    understanding     regarding    what\n\nconstitutes an offset well.      Not so.     The Herbsts’ briefing properly\n\nacknowledged that courts use the generally accepted meaning that a term\n\nhas been given in the oil and gas industry, if it is consistent with the plain\n\nlanguage of the lease. See Br. at 23-24.\n\n\n                                       13\n\f      It    is    Murphy,    not   the   Herbsts,   that   is   ignoring   industry\n\nunderstanding of what an “offset well” is. Murphy’s argument (at 11) that\n\nthere is no need for the well to be close to the triggering well because no\n\ndrainage is, in fact, occurring, is an artful way of saying that the offset well\n\nprovisions in the Leases were never intended to protect against the risk of\n\ndrainage.        In fact, Murphy’s expert said precisely that in his affidavit:\n\n“Plaintiffs’ contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to\n\nprotect their acreage from drainage is not correct.” SCR 177.\n\n      This position cannot be squared with the industry understanding of\n\nthe term “offset well.” Williams & Meyers’ Manual of Oil and Gas Terms, p.\n\n718 (1994 ed.), defines an offset well as a “well drilled on one tract of land\n\nto prevent the drainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a\n\nwell is being drilled or is already in production.” (Emphasis added.) The\n\nother dictionary definitions provided to the trial court and to this Court in\n\nthe Herbst’ initial brief (at 24-25) also make plain that protection from\n\ndrainage is the principal purpose of an offset well.\n\n      As the Herbsts’ expert Gregg Robertson correctly states:\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f     [T]he inclusion of a provision such as the one in paragraph 25\n     requiring remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on\n     offset acreage has only one, sole purpose – to prevent,\n     compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises\n     by the offending well. Common sense precludes any other\n     construction.\n\nSCR 240.\n\n     If Murphy believed no drainage was possible in the Eagle Ford,\n\nMurphy should not have accepted leases with these offset provisions. It\n\nshould not now be allowed to deprive the Herbsts of the benefit of their\n\nbargain based on its claim that no drainage is actually occurring. Allowing\n\nthis argument to prevail undermines the key purpose of Paragraph 25,\n\nwhich was designed to relieve the lessors of the difficult and expensive\n\nburden of proving drainage. See Herbsts’ Initial Br. at 21-23 (discussing\n\ndifficulties lessors experienced in proving drainage occurred).\n\n     F.    Resort to expert testimony on understanding in the industry\n           is unnecessary, and Murphy’s expert does not credibly\n           express that understanding.\n\n     Although Murphy contends in its brief that it does not need its expert\n\naffidavit, it alternatively contends that it would be proper to consider its\n\nexpert’s opinions because extrinsic evidence is proper here.       Industry\n\n\n                                     15\n\funderstanding can be determined without resort to Murphy’s expert\n\naffidavit, and, as the definitions discussed above and in the Herbsts’ initial\n\nbrief conclusively show, that industry understanding rejects Murphy’s\n\nposition.\n\n      The word “offset” has a plain dictionary meaning and expert\n\ntestimony cannot be used to contradict that meaning.

And Mr.\n\nRobertson’s testimony is not based on his bare opinions but, instead on the\n\ndictionary and industry definitions in the Herbsts’ motion papers; the\n\nLeases; his vast experience in the oil and gas business, including experience\n\nreviewing hundreds of oil and gas leases; his knowledge of RRC rules and\n\nindustry practice and terminology; and his review of Mr. McBeath’s\n\ncompeting affidavit. SCR 238-42.\n\n\n\n\n                                     17\n\fII.   The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s fees. (Issue\n      Two)\n\n      A.   The trial court had no statutory authority to award attorney’s\n           fees.\n\n      There is no legal basis for awarding Murphy any attorney’s fees in\n\nthis case. The Herbsts sued Murphy for breach of contract. SCR 5-11.\n\nMurphy counterclaimed for attorneys’ fees under Chapters 37 and 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. SCR 116. Neither provides a\n\nbasis for a recovery of fees by Murphy.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 17) that it is entitled to recover fees under Chapter\n\n37, which is the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). Murphy\n\ndoes not discuss the 2009 and 2011 Texas Supreme Court cases that the\n\nHerbsts relied on in their brief – MBM Fin. Corp. v.

Both of these cases hold that, when a request\n\nfor declaratory judgment is merely “tacked onto” a breach of contract\n\nclaim, it cannot be a basis for a fee award. MBM, 660 S.W.3d at 670; Etan,\n\n359 S.W.3d at 624. Here, Murphy’s UDJA counterclaim sought to determine\n\nwhether Murphy had breached the Leases (SCR 115-16) and was “part and\n\nparcel” of the contract claim. MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 671.\n\n                                     18\n\f      Murphy ignores these authorities. Instead, Murphy relies (at 17) on a\n\n1989 case neither party cited in the trial court, Winslow v. Acker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2395250\"><a href=\"/opinion/2395250/winslow-v-acker/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1989, writ denied). Winslow is not on\n\npoint. First, in Winslow, the “appellants’ lawsuit sought recovery of their\n\nalleged proportion of the overriding royalty interests which were assigned\n\nto appellees,” but the appellees’ counterclaim would settle “all future\n\ndisputes as to the granting of royalties under the partition deed.” Id. at 328\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, the court found that the declaratory relief would\n\nresolve issues beyond those presented in the plaintiffs’ suit. Id. Second,\n\nthe court had another ground for allowing the relief – the appellants had\n\nwaived any right to challenge the declaratory judgment action. Id. Third,\n\nthe issue of whether attorney’s fees could be recovered as part of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action was not even at issue – appellees had non-\n\nsuited their request for fees. Id. at 323.\n\n      Murphy claims (at 18) that its declaratory judgment action, like that\n\nin Winslow, involved a “proper interpretation of the Leases [that] will reach\n\nbeyond the current dispute.” An examination of the relief the trial court\n\ngranted in this case shows that Murphy is wrong. The trial court did not\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fdecide anything other than the current dispute. It ruled, using language\n\nproposed by Murphy:\n\n     a.    Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous;\n     b.     The Herbst #1H Well, on which Murphy commenced\n     drilling operations June 8, 2012, was drilled as an off-set well\n     pursuant to Paragraph 25 of the Leases and satisfies the\n     requirements of Paragraph 25 of the Leases; and\n     c.     Murphy has not breached the Leases with regard to the\n     drilling and completion of the Herbst #1H Well and does not\n     owe compensatory royalties or any other obligations under\n     Paragraph 25 as a result.\n\nSCR 415.\n\n     These “declarations” do nothing more than resolve the breach of\n\ncontract dispute for which the Herbsts filed suit. They do not, as Murphy\n\nsuggests (at 18), “reach beyond the current dispute.” They address only\n\nthe well in question and the issue of whether Murphy breached the\n\nagreement by drilling that well instead of another one. Those are the very\n\nissues covered by the Herbsts’ breach of contract action.\n\n     B.    If the trial court had authority to award fees under the UDJA,\n           it abused its discretion in awarding fees on appeal.\n\n     If the Court holds that a fee award under the UDJA is available, the\n\nCourt should nevertheless reverse the district court’s award here. The trial\n\ncourt denied fees incurred in the trial court, reasoning that the Herbsts\n\n                                     20\n\f“had the right to present their arguments to the Court for the Court to\n\nmake a determination . . . and should not be penalized by having to pay\n\nhuge amounts of attorney’s fees.” RR 47, l. 2 - 5. The trial court then\n\nawarded conditional fees to Murphy in the event the Herbsts sought\n\nappellate review.    SCR 486.     Having effectively found that it was not\n\n“equitable or just” to award trial court fees, the court had no basis for then\n\nholding that the Herbsts should be “penalized” with fees if they sought\n\nreview in this Court.\n\n      Murphy argues (at 20) there is no “rule or statute” or “policy or\n\nrationale” to prevent a trial court from denying trial court fees but\n\nawarding appellate fees. There may not be a formal rule or a statute, but\n\nthere is strong policy and rationale for holding that the trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it makes such an award.\n\n      As the court of appeals stated in Reagan v. Marathon Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2174592\"><a href=\"/opinion/2174592/reagan-v-marathon-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83-84 (Tex.

See 1 B. Kramer and P. Martin, Pooling\n   and Unitization 2-3 (3d ed. 1989).\n\nOffset royalty\n       A royalty payable under the provisions of an occasional lease in lieu of\n   the drilling of an offset well.\n      When a lessee has separate leases on two adjacent tracts, A and B,\n   if he drills a well on tract A which drains tract B, under the OFFSET WELL\n   COVENANT (q.v.) he will normally be obligated to drill an offsef-well on tract\n   B to protect it from drainage. The drilling of such additional well may be\n   uneconomic in that existing wells suffice to recover the oil or gas in place.\n   Under these circumstances, the lessee may elect,:to :pay the owners of\n   royalty interests in tract B an offset royalty, if the lease:of tract :B contains\n   an offset royalty clause, instead of drilling the offset well otherwise required.\n   The offset royalty may be a flat annual sum or may be measured in some\n   other way, e.g., by the royalty which would have been paid if the offset\n   well had been drilled and placed in production. One type of offset royalty\n   clause appears in Foster v. Atlantic Refining Co., 329 F.2d 485,20 0.&G.R.1\n   422 (5th,Cir. 1964).\n      For a case concluding that an overriding royalty owner was entitled to\n   recover offset royalty for drainage when the drilling of a well on the drained\n   tract was precluded by the lessor who was. also the lessor of the tract\n   containing the draining well, see Cook v. El Paso Natural. Gas; Co., 560.F.2d\n   978, 58 Q.&G.R. 206 (10th Cir. 1977).\n       See also COMPENSATORY ROYALTY; SUBSTITUTE ROYALTY.\n\nOffset royalty clause\n      An express lease clause permitting the lessee to pay royalty in lieu of\n   drilling an offset well. See OFFSET ROYALTY.\n\nOffset well\n      (1) A well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the drainage of oil or\n   gas to an adjoining tract of land, on which a well is being drilled or is already\n   in production.\n      Prior to spacing regulations, wells along a surface mpertyline were\n   sometimes drilled in such profusion that they looked somewhat like fence\n   pests. Under spacing regulations, Well's are required to be drilled'Oh tracts\n   of a specified ',size. Where the spacing 'Unit is forty abrens, the Well can'be\n   drilled in the center. This type of developmen't of an oil field 'is called direct\n   offsetting, since the wells will be directly north and south or east and west\n   of each,other. Where the spacing unit is 20 acres, the well oneach unit\n   must be diagonal with the, well on the next unit. This pattern of develop-\n   ment is called DIAGONAL OFFSETTING (Q. v.)'\n      See also EQUIDISTANT OFFSET RULE.\n(Matthew Bender & Co., Inc.)

My employer, Platt Sparks is a petroleum engineering consulting firm that provides\n\n            consulting services to its clients in the oil and gas industry with regard to a wide array of\n\n            oil and gas related issues including, but not limited to, regulatory compliance and filings,\n\n            reservoir engineering studies, log analysis, reserve determination, economic analysis, fair\n\n            market value determinations, reservoir simulation, damage analysis, and lease royalty\n\n            provision analysis. A significant portion of my practice involves advising clients with\n\n            respect to Eagle Ford Shale (\"EFS\") formation exploration and development issues. I\n\n            have numerous clients involved in this trend and routinely advise them on issues such as\n\n            permitting wells, regulatory compliance, operational issues and other petroleum\n\n            engineering matters. As such,' I am familiar with terminology and issues applicable to\n\n            operations within the EFS.\n\n      4.    I am a 1987 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science\n\n            degree in Petroleum Engineering. I am a licensed Professional Engineer in Texas,\n\n            Wyoming, and California, a member of the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log\n\n            Analysts, and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. A copy of\n\n            my resume is attached as Exhibit JCM 1.\n\n      5.    I have reviewed PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n            dated September 5, 2013: I have been asked by counsel for Murphy to respond to\n\n            Plaintiffs' assertion that the Herbst B 1H Well is not an \"offset well\" under paragraph 25\n\n            of the leases at issue. (\"Shirley Lease\" and \"William Lease\") Specifically, I have been\n\n            asked whether the term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and if so,\n\n            whether it has a commonly understand meaning within the industry.\n\n      6.    The following is a list of information considered in my study:\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. IVIeBEATFI, P.E.

The EFS is a formation that underlies much of South Texas. It lies directly below the\n\n            Austin Chalk formation and has long been recognized as the hydrocarbon source rock for\n\n            the Austin Chalk. The EFS lies directly above the Buda Limestone formation. The EFS\n\n           varies in thickness from 20 feet to over 500 feet and in quality from top to bottom with\n\n           the Upper portion being carbonate-rich and the Lower portion shale-rich. The productive\n\n           part of the EFS is divided into oil, wet gas and dry gas areas. Exhibit JCM I contains a\n\n           map from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showing the different\n\n           producing areas of the EFS. Although a few wells historically produced from the\n\n           formation, development began in earnest in 2008 with the drilling of wells in La Salle\n\n           County by PetroHawk. These wells were the discovery of the Hawkville (Eagle Ford)\n\n           Field. Development has continued through current with most activity concentrated in the\n\n           oil and wet gas windows due to attractive liquids prices. Drilling efficiency has\n\n           improved significantly as well as the fine tuning of hydraulic fracture stimulation\n\n           treatments. Current development includes twenty-six Counties located in six RRC\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATFI, P.E.                                           Page 3\n\n174\n\f            districts. Exhibit JCM 3 is map from the RRC website showing the EFS development as\n\n            of January 2014.\n\n      8.    The Lucas \"A\" 1H well was drilled by Comstock Oil & Gas, LP in December 2011,\n\n            targeting the EFS. The RRC well completion papers and directional surveys all indicate\n\n            that the horizontal lateral was landed in the EFS. The form W-2 filed by Comstock\n\n            indicates that the well was completed on February 23, 2012. Exhibit JCM 4 is a\n\n            collection of RRC forms relating to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well. I have also reviewed the\n\n            RRC completion papers and directional survey for the Murphy Herbst B 1H well.\n\n            Drilling was initiated on Murphy's Herbst B 1H well on June 8, 2012. The Herbst well\n\n            horizontal lateral was also completed in the EFS. Exhibit JCM 5 is a collection of RRC\n\n            forms relating to the Herbst B 1H well.\n\n      9.    Drilling began on the Murphy Herbst B 1H well less than 120 days after the Comstock\n\n            Lucas \"A\" 1P1 well was completed.\n\n      10.   Based on the information contained in the Affidavit of Mr. Kane Heinen, it is clear that\n\n            the Herbst B 1H well was drilled by Murphy to fulfill their obligation under paragraph 25\n\n            of the Shirley and Williams leases.\n\n      11.   The Murphy Herbst B 1H well was drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n\n            from which the Comstock Lucas \"A\" 1H well produces.\n\n      12.   Based on my review of Plaintiffs' petition and motion for summary judgment, it is my\n\n            understanding that Plaintiffs contend that the Murphy Herbst B 1H Well is not an offset\n\n            well to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well because it is not as close as legally possible to the lease\n\n            line of the Lucas \"A\" lease. Plaintiffs' use of the term \"offset well\" is not consistent with\n\n            the industry use of the term.\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                  Page 4\n\n175\n\f      13.   The term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the oil and gas industry and is\n\n            commonly understood within the industry as describing any well drilled on an adjacent\n\n            lease or property. The term \"offset well\" can also refer to the closest well, even if it is\n\n            located on another lease. It is my opinion that Plaintiffs are viewing the term \"offset\n\n            well,\" as used in paragraph 25 of the Lease, as \"direct offset well\". A direct offset well is\n\n            also a specialized term within the oil and gas industry, and is commonly understood to be\n\n            a well that is located directly across a lease line or other legal boundary. A direct offset\n\n            well can be located at the closest legal location or even closer if the operator applies for\n\n            and receives an RRC Rule 37 exception. A direct offset well is sometime called an\n\n            immediate offset well. Direct offset wells and immediate offset wells are included within\n\n            the term offset wells, but not all offset wells are direct or immediate offset wells.\n\n      14.   The term \"offset well\" is used in RRC Rule 36 to define which wells can be used to\n\n            estimate the escape rate for use in calculating a radius of exposure for a well subject to\n\n            Rule 36. The RRC has never limited the wells available in this determination to wells\n\n            directly across the lease line, and Rule 36 is further evidence of how the term offset well\n\n            is understood within the industry.\n\n      15.   RRC form H-1, related to RRC Rule 46, shows that the term \"offset well\" is -understood\n\n            within the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property.. The H-1 form\n\n            requires offset wells within Y2 mile of the subject well to be identified on a map.\n\n      16.   Finally, RRC Proposals for Decisions (\"PFD\") and Final Orders (\"FO\") XX-XXXXXXX, 8A-\n\n            0211820, XX-XXXXXXX and 7C-0240684 contain further examples of the RRC's use of the\n\n            terms offset well, direct offset well and immediate offset well. These PFDs and FOs\n\n            further confirm that each of these specialized terms have a commonly understood\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. MeBEATH, P.E.

Based on my experience working with operators and other participants within the\n\n            industry, the usage of these terms by the RRC is consistent with how the terms are\n\n            commonly understood within the industry.\n\n      18.   I have reviewed the Shirley lease, dated August 14, 2009, and it is my opinion that the\n\n            Lease was drafted specifically for horizontal drilling in the EFS. The lease contains\n\n            specific language regarding horizontal wells and the size of pooled units associated with\n\n            horizontal wells. By August 2009, there was significant EFS development activity\n\n            nearby in Live Oak and Karnes Counties.\n\n      19.   Plaintiffs' contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to protect their\n\n            acreage from drainage is not correct. Due to the reservoir characteristics of the EFS, the\n\n            formation will not produce without large multi-stage hydraulic fracture jobs that provide\n\n            pathways between the formation and the wellbore. In the early development of the trend,\n\n            it was recognized that even with these hydraulic fracture stimulation jobs, a relatively\n\n            modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal well. The RRC assigned leaSe\n\n            line spacing rules that reflect this reality. Recently, several operators have installed pilot\n\n            programs to test the sensitivity of well spacing to well recoveries. Early indications\n\n            confirm that spacing horizontal laterals as close as 225 feet results in well recoveries\n\n            comparable to much wider spaced laterals.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATII, P.E.                                                  Page 6\n\n177\n\f      2l.   The reservoir characteristics of the EFS further support my conclusion that the\n\n            specialized term \"offset well,\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Lease, is not commonly\n\n            understood as a well drilled within 3.50 feet of the Lease line, as Plaintiffs contend.\n\n      21.   Plaintiffs refer to Williams and Meyers' Manual of Oil & Gas Terms for the definition of\n\n            Offset Clause. The definition of Offset Clause refers to Offset Well, another definition in\n\n            Williams & Meyers. Although Williams and Meyers states that the Offset Well is\n\n            intended to prevent drainage, neither definitions refer to a specific distance requirement\n\n            for an Offset Well. As stated above, the conventional concept of drainage across lease\n\n            lines has limited application in the EFS. Williams & Meyers offset well definition does\n\n            refer to \"direct offsetting\" when discussing wells that are directly across lease line on\n\n            equal-sized spacing units. Plaintiffs also refer to two on-line dictionaries having the same\n\n            definition of offset well. Before reading the Plaintiffs' motion I had not encountered\n\n            these sources. As stated above, it is my opinion that the term offset well encompasses the\n\n            more narrowly defined direct offset well. The on-line definitions used by Plaintiffs' more\n\n            accurately describe direct offset wells. My personal copy of \"A Dictionary of Petroleum\n\n            Terms\" 2\" ed. contains the following definition:\n\n                   offset well n: a well drilled on a tract of land next to another owner's tract on\n                   which there is a producing well.\n\n      22.   Based on my review of the information discussed above and my professional experience\n\n            in the industry for the past 25 years, it is my opinion that the Herbst B 114 well drilled by\n\n            Murphy on the Shirley and William leases is an offset well as that term is commonly\n\n            understood and used in the industry and paragraph 25 of the leases.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C.

I am over 18 years of a0, of sound mind, and\n\n      capable of making this affidavit. Except where indicated otherwise, the facts stated in this\n\n      affidavit are within. my personal knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n             2.      For the past thirty-five years I have worked in the family oil and gas business in\n\n      Corpus Christi, Texas that was founded by my father in 1975. We have provided consulting\n\n      geological services to other companies, operated a well service company for twenty years,\n\n      operated oil and gas production for thirty years and have been partners with numerous other oil\n\n      and gas companies in various oil and gas exploration and production ventures. My father was\n\n      instrumental in providing geologic supervision to the early pioneers in the Austin Chalk Trend\n\n      beginning in 1974, and I joined with Petrohawk Energy to drill the initial discovery wells for the\n\n      Hawkville (Eagle Ford Shale) Field in 2008.\n                                                                              EXHIBIT\n\n                                                      1\n                                                                                                2033219,1\n238\n\f              3.\n                           •                                            •\n                        My educational background includes a BA, in English from Sewanee: The\n\n      University of the. South in 1978, followed by studies at the graduate school of Geology at the\n\n      University of Texas, Austin from .1979-1980.\n\n              4.        I have reviewed the Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Suminary Judgment in the\n\n      above-described and numbered cause, the Affidavit of John C. McBeathi P.E, and the Railroad\n\n      Commission filings for the Comstrock Oil & Gas, LP OH Lucas \"A\" well and the .Murphy\n\n      Exploration and Production #11I Herbst \"B\" well, as well as the relevant portion of the Oil, Gas\n\n      and Mineral Leases covering the land where the Herbst well is drilled. I have been asked whether\n\n      the term. \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and what its commonly\n\n      understood meaning is within the industry, More specifically, I have 1Jeen asked whether. the\n\n      Murphy #111 Herbst \"IV Well is an \"offset well\" to the Comstock #1H Ilmeas \"A' Well, as that\n\n      term is used 'in Paragraph 25 of the Herbst leases.\n\n               5.     It is my opinion that the Murphy -#1H Herbst \"13\" Well is not an \"offset well\" to\n\n      the Comstock #1H Lucas \"A\" Well, as that term is used in the industry) and in the oil and gas\n\n      lease. An \"offset well\", as that term is used in the industry, is a well drillei!I as close as :possible to\n\n      the offending well in order to prevent or minimize drainage from the eased premises by the\n\n      offending well.\n\n              6.     • It is my understanding that there is no dispute that the governing. Oil, Gas, and\n\n      Mineral Leases are in effect and contain a Paragraph 25 with the \"offset cell provision\", that the\n\n      Comstock well was permitted and actually drilled closer than the 467' :buffer provided by the\n\n      offset well provision, and that. Murphy is relying upon the Herbst \"B\" , i1H well to satisfy the\n\n      remedies.required by the lease when a well is drilled within 467 feet of the leased premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          2\n                                                                                                        208321.9.1\n\n\n\n239\n\f              7.\n                                  •                                        •\n                      Mr. McBeath's affidavit has two arguments to support his opinion that the\n\n      Murphy #1H Herbst \"B\" Well satisfies Murphy's obligations under Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\n      leases: First, Mr. McBeath makes a distinction between the term \"offset Well\" and the conjecture\n\n      of a more specifically used term in the industry of \"direct offset well\". ► Second, Mr. McBeath\n\n      argues that the lease provision relating to an offset well has nothing to do with the potential for\n\n      drainage of the leased premises by the Comstock well (\"Plaintiffs contention that an offset well,\n\n      as used in the Lease, exists to protect their acreage from drainage is not! correct.\" — .McBeath,\n\n      page 6). Neither of these arguments has any credibility based upon conventional oilfield usage,\n\n      traditional construction of the English language nor common sense\n\n              8.      Regarding Mr. McBeath's argument as to the purpose of Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      leases: based upon my involvement in the construction of several htmdre ' oil and gas leases, and\n\n      specifically over one hundred' oil and gas leases in the past five years r the development of\n\n      Eagle Ford Shale reserves, the inclusion of a provision such as the one in paragraph 25 requiring\n\n      remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on offset acreage has only one, sole purpose - to\n\n      prevent, compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises i?y the offending well.\n\n      Common sense precludes any other construction. In fact, Paragraph 25 resiuires the lessee to drill\n\n      an \"offset well\" if an offending well is drilled, which is specifically defined in the lease as a well\n\n      drilled within 467' of the leased premises, which. at the time the lease was executed, defined a\n\n      well drilled closer to the lease than Railroad Commission rules would allow. The stated distance\n\n      of a well from the leased premises defines the specific intent that the cor'responding location of\n\n      an \"off-set well\" drilled under Paragraph 25 (1) should be equally as elo4 to the offending well\n\n      as possible to protect the Lessors' reserves from drainage by the offending well. For Murphy to\n\n      state that the Herbst well, located over 2100 feet away from the offending•well and being also as\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n                                                                                                    2083219.1\n240\n\f                                 •                                        •\n      far away as the configuration of the lease would allow, satisfies the Leases' offset remedy cannot\n\n      be. supported by standard oilfield practice, the intent of the parties in negotiating the lease, or\n\n      common sense.\n\n              9.       Mr. MeBeath's attempt to explain a presumed difference Wetween \"an offset well\"\n\n      and \"a direct offset well\" has no basis in standard oilfield practices. .I liave never seen in any\n\n      written contract nor heard in any conversation, such a distinction being made. Asserting that\n\n      there is no connection between the term. \"offset well\" and. a specific distance from a lease line is\n\n      a contrived and desperate attempt to explain Murphy's actions in this !matter. It deserves no\n\n      further rebtittal.\n\n              10.      In the highly competitive and intense development setting Of the Eagle Ford Shale\n\n      Trend, it has been my practice and that of my partners in the drilling of over 300 wells across\n\n      265,000 acres, to contact offset operators prior to setting up a drilling patiprn that begins 330 feet\n\n      from the common property boundary. There are numerous alternatives to starting a development\n\n      program on an adjacent lease to another operator rather than drilling the 'closest offset well first.\n\n      To do so without attempting to centact the offset operator first is akin tO dropping the glove to\n\n      start a duel, Likewise, should this event occur, it is incomprehensibly that a Lessee would\n\n      unilaterally drill a. knowingly contentious location such as the .Murphyi #11-I Herbst \"B\" Well\n\n      without conducting transparent conversations with the Lessors first, If the Herbst tract of land\n\n      merited the drilling of a well, there was no purpose served for either Mnrphy or the Lessors by\n\n      leaving the potential for drainage by the offsetting Comstock well un4hallenged. In fact, the\n\n      proper development of the Herbst tract will require at least two additional wells, which will both\n\n      be significantly closer to the Comstock well than the current Herbst \"B\" Well.

There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n     in accordance with the provisions of Commission Statewide Rules 37 and 38, which\n     applicable provisions of said rules are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n            In applying this rule, the general order of the Commission with relation to the\n     subdivision of property shall be observed.\n\n            Provided, however, that for purposes of spacing for horizontal wells, the following\n     shall apply:\n\n            a.     A take point in a horizontal drainhole well is any point along a horizontal\n                   drainhole where oil and/or gas can be produced from the reservoir/field\n                   interval. The first take point may be at a different location than the\n                   penetration point and the last take point may be at a location different than\n                   the terminus point.\n\n            b.     No horizontal drainhole well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled such that\n                   the first and last take point are nearer than ONE HUNDRED (100) feet to any\n                   property line, lease line or subdivision line.\n\n            d.     For each horizontal drainhole well, the perpendicular distance from any take\n                   point on such horizontal drainhole between the first take point and the last\n                   take point to any point on any property line, lease line or subdivision line\n                   shall be a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet.\n\n            For the purpose of assigning additional acreage to a horizontal well pursuant to Rule\n     86, the distance from the first take point to the last take point in the horizontal drainhole\n     shall be used in such determination, in lieu of the distance from penetration point to\n     terminus.\n\n\n\n\n89\n\f                                                                       •\n     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS.

In addition to the\n     standard required data, the certified plat shall include the as-drilled track of the wellbore,\n     the location of each take point on the wellbore, the boundaries of any wholly or partially\n     unleased tracts within a Rule 37 distance of the wellbore, and notations of the shortest\n     distance from each wholly or partially unleased tract within a Rule 37 distance of the\n     wellbore to the nearest take point on the wellbore.\n\n            A properly permitted horizontal drainhole will be considered to be in compliance with\n     the spacing rules set forth herein if the as-drilled location falls within a rectangle\n     established as folloWs:\n\n            a.     Two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the permitted drainhole and 33 feet\n                   on either side of the drainhole;\n\n            b.     The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                   in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                   the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n            Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n     to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n     measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n             For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n     same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n     on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n     applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n     requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n     mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n     for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n     mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n     notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n     depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n     after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n\n\n\n\n90\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS.

If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n     location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n     necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n     correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n     of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n     is the only mineral owner of the Offsite Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n     applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n     notice under this section, upon request.\n\n              RULE 3: The acreage assigned to the individual oil or gas well for the purpose of\n     allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n     drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n     unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided. All\n     proration units shall consist of continuous and contiguous acreage which can reasonably\n     be considered to be productive of oil. No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n\n            If after the drilling of the last well on any lease and the assignment of acreage to\n     each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n     additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n     remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n     assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n     among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n     inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n             For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n     or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n     Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n     of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n     For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n     the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n     proration units.\n\n            RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n     by multiplying 800 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the acreage\n     assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the maximum\n     acreage authorized by these field rules for proration purposes, exclusive of tolerance\n     acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio authority.\n\n           It is further ORDERED that all overproduction in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field,\n     Atascosa, Gonzales, La Salle, McMullen and Wilson Counties, Texas, is hereby canceled.\n\n           The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n     pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n\n\n\n91\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NOS.

The\n     Commission finds that, due to clerical error, the Final Order entered on May 15, 2012,\n     omitted the reference to a vertical well in Field Rule No. 4.\n\n            Accordingly, It is ORDERED that the Final Order in Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX be, and\n     the same is hereby amended nunc pro tunc, so that Field Rule No. 4 for the Eagleville\n     (Eagle Ford-1) Field contains the reference to a vertical well and the order now reads as\n     follows:\n\n            RULE 1: The entire correlative interval from 10,294 feet to 10,580 feet as shown\n     on the log of the EOG Resources, Inc. - Milton Unit, Well No. 1 (API No. 42-255-31608),\n     Section 64, John Randon Survey, A-247, Karnes County, Texas, shall be designated as\n     a single reservoir for proration purposes and be designated as the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-\n     1) Field.\n\n             RULE 2: No well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled nearer than THREE\n     HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line. There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n\n\n\n\n93\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO.

Two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the permitted drainhole and 33 feet\n                   on either side of the drainhole;\n\n            b.     The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                   in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                   the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n            Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n     to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n     measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n             For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n     same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n     on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n     applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n     requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n     mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n     for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n     mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n     notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n     depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n     after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n     this rule, the applicant must publish notice of this application pursuant to the Commission's\n     Rules of Practice and Procedure. If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n     location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n     necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n     correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n     of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n     is the only mineral owner of the Offsite. Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n     applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n     notice under this section, upon request.\n\n             RULE 3: The acreage assigned° to the individual oil well for the purpose of\n     allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n     drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n     unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided.

No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n     Additional acreage may be assigned to each horizontal drainhole well in accordance with\n     Statewide Rule 86.\n\n            If after the drilling of the last well on any lease and the assignment of acreage to\n     each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n     additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n     remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n     assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n     among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n     inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n            An operator, at his option, shall be permitted to form optional drilling units of FORTY\n     (40) acres. A proportional acreage allowable credit will be given for a well on a fractional\n     proration unit.\n\n             For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n     or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n     Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n     of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n     For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n     the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n     proration units. There is no maximum diagonal limitation in this field.\n\n            RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n     by multiplying 2,000 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\n     acreage assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the\n     maximum acreage authorized by these field rules for a vertical well for proration purposes,\n     exclusive of tolerance acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio\n     authority.\n\n             RULE 5: A flowing oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing\n     fees unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a)\n     exceptions, a six month exception to Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a) regarding the requirement\n     of having to be produced through tubing. A revised completion report will be filed once the\n     oil well has been equipped with the required tubing string to reflect the actual completion\n     configuration. This exception would be applicable for new drills, reworks, recompletions\n     or for new fracture stimulation treatments for any flowing oil well in the field. For good\n     cause shown, an operator may obtain administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n     unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(5)(a)\n     exceptions, an extension for an additional three months. If the request for an extension\n     of time is denied, the operator may request a hearing.\n\n            RULE 6: An oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n\n\n\n\n96\n\f                            •\n     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO.

This will allow for the\n     backdating of allowables on the oil wells without requiring a waiver to be secured from all\n     field operators. This rule will grant the Commission the authority to issue an allowable\n     back to the initial completion date for all oil wells in the field to prevent unnecessary shut-\n     ins to alleviate potential overproduction issues related to the completion paperwork filings\n     and producing the oil wells without tubing. If an extension of time is granted under Rule\n     5, the exception to Statewide Rule 51(a) under this rule is automatically extended for the\n     additional time.\n\n            It is further ORDERED that all overproduction in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1),\n     Dilworth (Eagle Ford), Leesville (Eagle Ford) and Pilgrim (Eagleford) Fields, Atascosa,\n     Dimmit, Gonzales, La Salle, McMullen, Wilson and Zavala Counties, Texas, is hereby\n     canceled.\n\n           The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n     pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n            Done this 26th day of June, 2012.\n\n                                                RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n                                                 (Order approved and signatures affixed by\n                                                 OGC Unprotested Master Order dated June\n                                                 26, 2012)\n\n\n\n\n97\n\f        TAB 9\n\nHerbsts’ Petition (SCR 5-11)\n\f                           •                                               •\n                                        CAUSE NO.        13-05-bLito - Neu\n     SHIRLEY ADAMS, CHARLENE BURGESS, §                            IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n     WILLIE MAE HERBST JASIK,\n     WILLIAM ALBERT HERBST,\n     HELEN HERBST and\n     R.

Effective August 14, 2009, Plaintiffs Shirley Mae Herbst Adams for the Shirley\n\nTract and William Albert Herbst for the William Tract, executed and delivered oil and gas leases\n\nto Alvin M. Barrett & Associates, Inc., a Texas Corporation (\"Barrett\"), granting, leasing, and\n\nletting the land described above in Paragraph 7 for the purpose of exploring, drilling, mining for,\n\nand producing oil and gas from the described land. Copies of the leases and Memorandum of the\n\nleases are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B and incorporated by reference. Barrett\n\nsubsequently assigned the leases to Murphy. The lease of the Shirley Tract is referred to herein\n\nas the Shirley Lease and the lease of the William Tract is referred to as the William Lease.\n\n       10.       Comstock Oil & Gas, LP has recently drilled a well on the tract just to the\n\nsouthwest of the Shirley and William Leases — its Lucas \"A\" Lease, called the Lucas \"A\" #1H.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                                                    •\n    The well was completed in the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field. It first produced in March 2012.\n\n    Railroad Commission records indicate that, through March 1, 2013, the well had produced\n\n    45,630 barrels of oil and 60,530 mcf of natural gas. According to the permit plat filed with the\n\n    Railroad Commission, the lateral of the well is located 350 feet from the boundaries of the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases.\n\n           11.     Murphy has drilled its Herbst Unit B #1H horizontal well on the Shirley and\n\n    William Leases. The well was spudded on June 7, 2012, and completed on July 7, 201.2. The\n\n    lateral of the well is located some 450 feet from the northeast line of the Shirley and William\n\n    Leases. This would make the Herbst Unit B #1H well approximately 1800 feet from the\n\n    southwest boundaries of the Shirley Lease and the William Lease. See plat attached as Exhibit C\n\n    showing the lease and unit boundaries and the location of the two wells.\n\n           12.     The Offset Clauses in the Shirley Lease and the William Lease are identical.\n\n    Found in Paragraph 25 of each Lease, the Offset Clauses provide that, if a well \"is completed as\n\n    a producer of oil and/or gas on land adjacent and contiguous to the leased premises, and within\n\n    467 feet of the premises covered by this lease, ... [then], within 120 days after the completion\n\n    date of the well or wells on the adjacent acreage,\" Lessee must either:\n\n           (1) commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and thereafter continue\n           the drilling of such off-set well or wells with due diligence to a depth adequate to\n           test the same formation from which the well or wells are producing from on the\n           adjacent acreage: or\n\n           (2) pay the Lessor royalties as provided for in this lease as if an equivalent\n           amount of production of oil and/or gas were being obtained from the off-set\n           location on these leased premises as that which is being produced from the\n           adjacent well or wells; or\n\n           (3) release an amount of acreage sufficient to constitute a spacing unit equivalent\n           in size to the spacing unit that would be allocated under this lease to such well or\n           wells on the adjacent lands, as to the zones or strata producing in such adjacent\n           well.\n\n                                                    4\n\n8\n\f                              •\n            13.

Plaintiffs incorporate the factual allegations contained in Section IV as if set forth\n\n    fully at length.\n\n                                       Cause of Action: Breach of Contract\n\n            15.        Plaintiffs sue for underpayment of royalties due under the Offset Clauses in the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek monetary relief over $200,000 as well as non-\n\n    monetary relief determining their rights under the Offset Clauses in the Shirley and William\n\n    Leases. At this time, Plaintiffs are not seeking monetary relief of more than $1,000,000, but\n\n    reserve the right to amend and seek recovery of amounts in excess of that amount if warranted.\n\n    Plaintiffs allege that the amount of underpayment under the Shirley and William Leases\n\n    increases each month that the Lucas \"A\" #1H continues to produce oil and/or gas and Defendant\n\n    fails to drill an offset well or release acreage pursuant to the terms .of the Offset Clauses\n\n    contained in the Shirley and William Leases.\n\n            16.        All conditions precedent to Plaintiffs' recovery have occurred.\n\n            17.        Plaintiffs seek recovery of the underpaid royalties due under Offset Clauses in the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek recovery of interest pursuant to the terms of the\n\n    Shirley and William Leases. Plaintiffs seek all reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees that they\n\n    have incurred. See Tex. Civ. Pr. & Rem. Code §§ 38.001-38.006; Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann.\n\n    § 91.406. Plaintiffs also seek recovery of their costs of court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5\n\n9\n\f                            •\n                                   Cause of Action: Declaratory Judgment\n\n            18.     Plaintiffs move the Court to issue declaratory judgments and construe the rights of\n\n     the parties to .the Shirley and William Leases, including the rights of all royalty owners, pursuant\n\n     to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek a\n\n     declaratory judgment of the Court that: (i) Murphy, as the lessee under the Shirley and William\n\n     Leases, is required either to drill an offset • well within 350 feet of the boundary between the\n\n     Shirley and William Leases and the lands on which the Lucas \"A\" #1H is located or to pay\n\n     substitute royalties or release acreage per the terms of the Offset Clauses in each Lease; (ii)\n\n     Murphy is required to pay offset royalties per the terms of the Offset Clauses based on all\n\n     production from the. Lucas \"A\" #1H that occurs more than 120 days after the commencement of\n\n     production on that well until Murphy either releases acreage or drills an offset well in accordance\n\n     with the terms of the Leases; and (iii) the Herbst Unit B #1H horizontal well drilled by Murphy\n\n     does not qualify as an offset well under the Offset Clauses of the Leases.\n\n            19.     Plaintiffs pray for recovery of their costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys'\n\n     fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 37.009.\n\n                                        VI. Request for Disclosure.\n\n            20.     Under TEX. R. Civ. P. 194, Plaintiff requests that Defendants disclose within 30\n\n     days of the service of this request, the information described in 194.2.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      6\n\n10\n\f/-   '\n                                •\n                                                     VII.

Murphy drilled the Herbst Well as an offset to the Lucas Well, specifically to\n\n      satisfy its obligations under Paragraph 25. On information and belief, the Herbst Well was\n\n      drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formation as the Lucas Well, as required by\n\n      Paragraph 25. Plaintiffs are now receiving royalties from the Herbst Well. Neither Paragraph\n\n      25, nor any other portion of the Leases, requires Murphy to drill a well in a specific location or\n\n      within a specific distance from the boundaries of the Leases. Murphy, acting a reasonably\n\n      prudent operator, selected the best location for the Herbst Well and drilled a successful well\n\n      adequate to test the same Eagle Ford formation in which the Lucas Well was completed.\n\n                13.     Thus, Murphy has fully complied with the obligation under Paragraph 25 to drill\n\n      an off-set well with due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation.\n\n                                             IV. COUNTERCLAIM\n\n      A.        Declaratory Judgment\n\n                14.     Murphy incorporates the foregoing paragraphs by reference as if fully set forth\n\n      herein.\n\n                15.     Murphy seeks a declaration that Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous as a\n\n      matter of law and that Murphy has complied with Paragraph 25.\n\n                16.     Specifically, Murphy seeks a declaration that Paragraph 25 requires Murphy \"to\n\n      commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and thereafter continue the drilling of such\n\n      off-set well or wells with due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation from\n\n      which the well or wells are producing from on the adjacent acreage.\"\n\n                17.     Murphy seeks a further declaration that \"off-set well\" as used within Paragraph 25\n\n      of the Leases is a specialized term with a commonly understood meaning within the industry and\n\n      that by drilling the Herbst Well, Murphy complied with Paragraph 25 of the Leases.\n\n\n\n\n      Active 11441659                                   4\n115\n\f                18.     Finally, Murphy seeks a declaration that it has not breached the Leases, and that it\n\n      does not owe compensatory or other royalties to Plaintiffs as a result.\n\n                19.     Alternatively, in the event the Court were to find that the Lease is susceptible to\n\n      two reasonable interpretations, Murphy seeks a declaration from this Court that Paragraph 25 of\n\n      the Leases is ambiguous in that it does not define the term \"off-set well\" and that term, as used in\n\n      Paragraph 25, is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.\n\n                20.     Murphy seeks a further declaration that \"off-set well\" is a specialized term with a\n\n      commonly understood meaning within the industry and that by drilling the Herbst Well, Murphy\n\n      complied with the intent of the parties and industry practice as expressed in Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      Leases.\n\n                21.     Finally, Murphy seeks a declaration that it has not breached the Leases, and that it\n\n      does not owe compensatory or other royalties to Plaintiffs as a result.\n\n      C.        Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n\n                22.     Pursuant to Chapters 37 and 38 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code,\n\n      Murphy seeks its reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in prosecuting its\n\n      counterclaim.\n\n                                      V.    CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n                        Murphy requests that the Court, after trial or final hearing, enter judgment in its\n\n      favor:\n\n                        (a)    that Plaintiffs take nothing by reason of this suit;\n\n                        (b)    that the Court enter declarations that:\n\n                               (i)     Paragraph 25 of the Leases is unambiguous;\n\n                               (ii)    The Herbst Well satisfies Paragraph 25 of the Leases; and\n\n\n\n\n      Active 11441659                                     5\n116\n\f          TAB 11\n\nExcept from Murphy’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (SCR 123)\n\f      A.       The Herbst Well Qualifies As An Offset Well Under Paragraph 25 Of The Leases.\n\n                          Under Paragraph 25 of the Leases, once a well is drilled within 467 feet of the\n\n      Lease boundary, Murphy has an obligation, within 120 days, to do one of three things: (1) drill\n\n      an offset well, (2) pay compensatory royalties as if the triggering well was completed on the\n\n      Lease, or (3) release acreage. Murphy chose to drill an offset well, which is required to be\n\n      drilled \"to a depth adequate to test the same formation from which the well or wells are\n\n      producing from on the adjacent acreage.\" (Leases ¶ 25.)\n\n                          The Herbst Well complies with each and every requirement of Paragraph 25 of\n\n      the Leases. The Herbst Well was drilled within 120 days of the completion of the Lucas Well on\n\n      the adjacent property. (Heinen Aff. ¶ 11.) The Herbst Well was drilled to an adequate depth to\n\n      test the same formation from which the Lucas Well was producing. (McBeath Aff. ¶ 11.) And,\n\n      as noted above, Murphy drilled the Herbst Well on the Leases specifically to offset the Lucas\n\n      Well. (Heinen Aff. ¶ 9.)\n\n      B.       \"Off-set well\" Is A Specialized Term With A Commonly Understood Meaning\n               Within The Oil And Gas Industry.\n\n               1.         Extrinsic evidence is admissible and necessary to explain the meaning of \"off-\n                          set well\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Leases.\n\n                          Extrinsic evidence is \"admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning\n\n      consistent with that to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to interpret contractual terms.\"\n\n      Mescalero Energy Inc. v.

And so attorney's fees\n\n 6   were not awarded, And I will change my order to the\n\n 7   extent of reducing the amount of attorney's fees\n\n 8   reasonable and necessary on appeal. And the Court of\n\n 9   Appeals can then determine whether or not that's an\n\n10   appropriate decision by this Court as well.

When\nthe parties executed their agreement, AAA rules did not require arbitrator-impartiality, but by\nthe time Americo invoked arbitration in 2005 after disputes arose concerning the additional\npayments to Myer, the AAA rules by default required that “[a]ny arbitrator shall be impartial and\nindependent ... and shall be subject to disqualification for ... partiality or lack of independence....”\nAAA Commercial Arbitration Rules R–17(a)(I) (2003).\n\nMyer alleged that Americo's first-choice arbitrator, Ernest Figari, Jr., was partial toward Americo,\nand successfully moved the AAA to disqualify him. Americo objected to Figari's disqualification\nbut named another arbitrator, about whom Myer likewise complained, and whom the AAA\nlikewise struck. Myer did not object to Americo's third appointee, who ultimately served on the\npanel. The arbitration proceeding resulted in a unanimous award in Myer's favor amounting to just\nover $26 million in payments due, breach-of-contract damages, and attorneys' fees.\n\nWhen Myer moved to confirm the award in the trial court, Americo renewed its objection to Figari's\ndisqualification. Americo argued that in disqualifying Figari for partiality, the AAA failed to\nfollow the arbitrator-selection process specified in the parties' agreement, which provided only that\n“each arbitrator shall be a knowledgeable, independent businessperson or professional.” The trial\ncourt determined the arbitration agreement was ambiguous but ultimately agreed with Americo's\nreading and vacated the award. Myer appealed, and the court of appeals reversed on the ground\nthat Americo had waived its objection to Figari's removal. We reversed that decision. Americo\nLife, Inc. v.

The parties in this case agreed to “tripartite\narbitration,” through which each party would directly appoint an arbitrator, and the two party-\nappointed arbitrators would agree on a third panelist.

But in\nBurlington, unlike this case, there was “no dispute ... that the parties intended and understood\nthat the party arbitrators would be aligned with, act as advocates for, and ultimately side with the\nappointing party.” Id.\n\nThe AAA rules in place when the agreement was executed likewise reflect the prevalence of\nthis practice. At that time, the rules provided that “[u]nless the parties agree otherwise, an\narbitrator selected unilaterally by one party is a party-appointed arbitrator and not subject to\ndisqualification pursuant to Section 19.” AAA Commercial Arbitration § 12 (1996). Section 19\ncontained procedures to challenge arbitrators for partiality. See id., § 19. Accordingly, the AAA\nrules presumed party-appointed arbitrators were non-neutral, and the parties would have to “agree\notherwise” to rebut this presumption.\n\nThe only indication the parties sought to “agree otherwise” is their requirement that party-\nappointed arbitrators be “independent.” Americo argues that the parties chose the word\n“independent” not to require impartiality, but to proscribe arbitrators employed by or otherwise\nunder the control of one of the parties. Americo's argument is certainly plausible; the practice of\nappointing arbitrators who are somehow formally associated with the party appointing them is\nnot unheard of.

The agreement provides\nthat arbitrators “shall be entitled to retain a lawyer to advise them as to legal matters, but such\nlawyer shall have none of the relationships to Americo or Myer (or any of their Affiliates) that\nare proscribed above for arbitrators.” The only term that can be fairly read as a proscription of a\n“relationship” between a party and its chosen arbitrator is the requirement that all arbitrators be\n“independent” of the party appointing them. But it does not follow that an “independent” arbitrator\nmust also be impartial; indeed, an independent arbitrator could be partial or impartial. However,\nif we follow Myer's suggestion that “independent” is synonymous with “impartial,” it becomes\nunclear what “relationship” the agreement is attempting to proscribe. Impartiality is a state of\nmind, but “independent” necessarily refers to a relationship—the subject is free from someone\nor something.\n\n *24 The industry norm for tripartite arbitrators when the parties executed their agreement was\nthat party-appointed arbitrators were advocates, and the AAA rules in place at that time presumed\nsuch arbitrators would not be impartial unless the parties specifically agreed otherwise. Given\nthe pervasiveness of the practice, and the clear AAA presumption the parties had to rebut, we\nbelieve the parties would have done more than require its arbitrators to be “independent” if they\nwished them to be impartial. “Independent” and “impartial” are not interchangeable in this context,\nand therefore we conclude the parties did not intend to require impartiality of party-appointed\narbitrators.\n\n\n\n                                                      B\n\n [11] Having concluded the terms of the agreement do not require impartial party-appointed\narbitrators, we turn to the effect of the incorporated-by-reference AAA rules on arbitrator\nqualifications. There is no dispute the AAA rules would govern matters on which the agreement is\nsilent. The question is whether AAA rules on arbitrator qualifications can, as the court of appeals\nconcluded, supplement terms agreed on by the parties that specifically speak to the same point.\n\nThe court of appeals reasoned that the rules and the agreement “can be read together and\nharmonized to avoid any irreconcilable conflict.” Myer v.

In other words, because “impartial” could be added without negating any\nexpressly chosen qualifications, it was proper to do so to effectuate all the agreement's provisions.\nBut this cannot be the end of our inquiry, or the specifically chosen terms of any agreement would\nbe hopelessly open-ended whenever outside rules are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Federal Arbitration\nAct, which the parties agree governs their agreement, requires that if an agreement provides “a\nmethod of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, such method shall\nbe followed.” 9 U.S.C. § 5. Similarly, the AAA rules in effect when the parties executed their\nagreement, as well as when arbitration was invoked, both provide that “[i]f the agreement of the\nparties names an arbitrator or specifies a method of appointing an arbitrator, that designation or\nmethod shall be followed.” AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules § 14 (1996), R–12 (2003).\n\n [13] Any attempt to harmonize the AAA impartiality rule with the parties' expressly chosen\narbitrator qualifications misses the point. We do not construe “conflict” between an agreement\nand incorporated rules so narrowly as to find it exists only if the rule contradicts the agreement. A\nconflict can exist when an agreement and incorporated rules speak to the same point. Even if both\ncan be followed without contradiction, they conflict because the parties have already addressed the\nmatter and are not in need of gap-filling from the AAA rules. When the agreement and incorporated\nrules speak to the same point, the agreement's voice is the only to be heard.\n\nHere, the parties chose a short list of arbitrator qualifications, and in doing so we must assume\nthey spoke comprehensively. The parties chose “knowledgeable” and “independent” but not\n“impartial,” and we think they meant not only what they *25 said but also what they did not\nsay. See CKB & Assocs. v.

And though\nwe can concede the parties embraced some uncertainty by adopting AAA rules that were subject\nto change, we cannot conceive that they agreed to be bound by rules that would alter the express\nterms of their agreement. Nor can we imagine they took the trouble to expressly agree on some\nterms if their decision to incorporate AAA rules would leave those terms open to alteration. The\nAAA impartiality rule conflicts with the parties' agreement because the parties spoke on the matter\nand did not choose impartiality. When such a conflict arises, the agreement controls. Szuts, 931\nF.2d at 832.\n\n***\n\nBecause the AAA disqualified Americo's first-choice arbitrator for partiality, the arbitration panel\nwas formed contrary to the express terms of the arbitration agreement. The panel, therefore,\nexceeded its authority when it resolved the parties' dispute. See City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d\nat 20; I.S. Joseph Co., 803 F.2d at 399.

The parties, by written agreement, may vary the procedures set forth\n             in these rules.\n\nAAA Commercial Arbitration § 1 (1996) (emphasis added). That provision is not in the least\nambiguous or unclear. The parties could have, but did not, incorporate the 1996 rules into their\nagreement while excluding any amendments to the rules. Then their agreement would not have\nbeen “open-ended” as the Court describes it. Rather, the parties incorporated language specifying\nthat their disputes would be resolved according to whatever AAA rules were in effect when the\ndemand for arbitration was made. The Court's conclusion *28 that the parties could not have\nmeant exactly what they said because the terms of their agreement would “leave those terms open\nto alteration” is a judicial re-making of the parties' agreement. If the parties to a contract want its\nterms to be open to alteration, they are entitled to make it so. If they do not, they can make it so.\nBut whichever way they choose should be honored by the courts.\n\nAs to the Court's conclusion that there is a conflict between the arbitrator requirements in the trailer\nagreement and those in the AAA rules, there is no dispute that the 2003 AAA Rules apply. And\nas the court of appeals explained, the 2003 rules provide that when parties have agreed to each\nname an arbitrator, the standards of rule R–17 with respect to impartiality and independence will\napply unless the parties have “specifically agreed” that the arbitrators are to be non-neutral and do\nnot have to meet such standards. Myer, 371 S.W.3d at 543 (citing AAA Commercial Arbitration\nRule R–12(b) (2003)). Rule R–17 provides that\n\n             Any arbitrator shall be impartial and independent and shall perform his or her\n             duties with diligence and in good faith, and shall be subject to disqualification\n             for ... partiality or lack of independence.\n\nAAA Commercial Arbitration Rule R–17(a) (2003). The trailer agreement provides that arbitrators\nwill be knowledgeable, independent businesspeople or professionals. But Americo and Myer did\nnot “specifically agree” that the arbitrators would be non-neutral and need not meet the Rule R–\n17 standards. Therefore, in addition to the qualifications the parties set out in the first paragraph\nof section 3.3 of the trailer agreement, the parties also agreed that (1) the AAA arbitration rules\nin effect at the time arbitration was demanded would apply, and (2) pursuant to the 2003 rules\nthat were in effect when arbitration was demanded, the arbitrators would be impartial and perform\ntheir duties with diligence and good faith.\n\nThe Court concludes that the provisions in the trailer agreement and those in Rule R–17 conflict.\nIt reaches that conclusion by assuming that the parties listed in their separate agreement all\nthe requirements they desired of their arbitrators. But the trailer agreement language does not\nsupport such an assumption. To the contrary, the language of section 3.3 of the trailer agreement\ndemonstrates just the opposite—that when the parties intended to supplant, vary, or circumscribe\nthe provisions of the AAA rules, they knew exactly how to specifically do so:\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By assuming the parties included\nall the arbitrator qualifications they desired in the trailer agreement, the Court confounds the intent\nof the parties as unambiguously expressed by the words they used in their agreement and the\nprovisions of the AAA rules they incorporated into their agreement. That assumption leads the\nCourt to determine that the trailer agreement and the AAA rules conflict when in reality they can\nbe harmonized as our extensive contract interpretation precedent requires.\n\nIn the end the Court misses the mark: the parties' unambiguous agreement and AAA Rule R–17\nrequiring arbitrator impartiality can be harmonized, and the parties did not expressly agree that\nthe arbitrators could be non-neutral as they were required to do if they intended to negate the\napplicable AAA rules requiring impartiality. The parties were entitled to make whatever agreement\nthey chose, open to alteration or not. Because the provisions of the trailer agreement and Rule\nR–17 can be harmonized, the provisions of both can be given effect. The provisions require the\narbitrators to be impartial.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.

They began renovating the home in May 2000. The renovations continued\ninto the year 2002 and were not completed by the time of trial. Furthermore, much of the work\nwas done by Don Beckham himself, and during their construction, the Beckhams left materials,\nsupplies, equipment, and trash on the property. Various other residents of the subdivision\ncomplained about this to the Association. The latter, in response, requested the Beckhams to clean\ntheir property. They did not but rather continued with their construction.\n\nThe renovations included excavation of the land at the rear of the house and the erection of a\npatio. Apparently, the floor of the patio served as the ceiling of a 1000 square foot space that the\nBeckhams were finishing to resemble the first floor of a three story home. Also erected below the\npatio but next to this 1000 square foot area was a small brick and windowed edifice. Other items\nwere also built on the property. They included a retaining wall that eventually had to be replaced\nand a metal tower standing higher than the roof of the home. The tower was to be used to receive\nhigh definition television signals from Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Association eventually sued the Beckhams for nuisance and to enforce various of the\nrestrictive covenants. Initially, the Beckhams chose to represent themselves and answered the\npetition with a general denial. Later, requests for admissions were served upon them, which\nrequests they failed to answer in a timely manner. And, though they attempted to relieve\nthemselves of the effect of their omission, the trial court struck only three of the deemed\nadmissions.\n\nEventually, the Beckhams retained counsel when they were served with a motion for summary\njudgment filed by the Association. They also later sought an extension of time to respond to the\nmotion. The extension was granted, and the summary judgment was subsequently denied. The case\nwas then tried to a jury. The latter held for the Beckhams, and judgment was eventually entered\nreflecting that verdict.\n\n\n\n                      Issue 1-Late Response to Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nIn its first issue, the Association complains of the trial court's decision to extend the time in which\nthe Beckhams had to respond to its motion for summary judgment. We overrule the point.\n\nAn appellate court cannot review an order overruling a motion for summary judgment via appeal\nafter a conventional trial on the merits. Motor 9, Inc. v. World Tire Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772579\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772579/motor-9-inc-v-world-tire-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n(Tex.App.-Amarillo 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Given this, the fact that the trial court at bar overruled\nthe motion for summary judgment, and the fact that a conventional trial on the merits has been\nheld, any question about the validity of the trial court's decision to extend the deadline at issue is\neffectively moot or irrelevant. This is so because to afford the first issue any meaning or effect\nwould require us to also decide whether the extension affected the trial court's decision to deny\nthe summary judgment motion. Yet, because we cannot review the decision to deny the motion,\nit does not matter if the trial court legitimately afforded the Beckhams more time to respond to\nthe motion. So, we overrule the first issue.\n\n\n\n                                 Issue 2-Striking of Deemed Admissions\n\n*2 In its second issue, the Association argues that the trial court erred in striking three of the 38\ndeemed admissions made by the Beckhams. We overrule the issue.\n\nThe Beckhams failed to respond to admissions served on them. Consequently, they were deemed\nadmitted against them. However, upon their motion, the trial court struck three of the admissions.\nThe three involved were:\n35. You knowingly violated the Deed Restrictions.\n\n36. You willfully violated the Deed Restrictions.\n\n37. All of the facts contained in Plaintiff's First Amended Original Petition are true and correct.\n\n\nAccording to the Association, the trial court erred in permitting their amendment or withdrawal\nbecause the Beckhams failed to show good cause to justify the action. Yet, other than simply\nmentioning Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 198.3 in general, the Association provided us with\nno legal authority discussing the concept of good cause or illustrating why the reasons proffered by\nthe Beckhams to justify their omission failed to satisfy the applicable standard. This falls short of\ncomplying with the requirements of Rule 38.1(h) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. The\nlatter obligates an appellant to include within its argument “appropriate citations to authorities....”\nSince the Association did not do so, it waived its complaint. See State Farm Lloyds, Inc. v.\nWilliams, 960 S.W .2d 781, 789 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1997, pet. dism'd by agr.) (holding that the\nfailure to cite to supporting authority waives the issue).\n\n\n\n                                      Issues 3, 4, 5 and 12-Nuisance\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nIssues three, four, five, and twelve involve the question of nuisance. Through them, the Association\nattacks the trial court's 1) refusal to grant it a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the\nverdict on the issue and 2) refusal to exclude pictures depicting the condition of other parcels of\nproperty in the subdivision. We sustain the issues.\n\nThe deed restrictions at issue provided:\n         No noxious or offensive trade or activity shall be carried on or maintained on any\n         lot in said subdivision, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become\n         a nuisance in the neighborhood. A nuisance shall include but not be limited to: a\n         truck larger than three-quarter ton parked on lots or roads or permanently kept on\n         property; any motor vehicle not properly licensed by the State of Texas; junk or\n         wrecking yards; automobiles, trucks or other vehicles used for parts.\n\n\nMoreover, the Beckhams admitted that the construction material, supplies, equipment, trash and\ndebris “located on [their] property for more than 6 months ... created a nuisance,” “a dangerous\ncondition,” “a threat to the health and safety of [their] neighbors,” “a threat to the health and\nsafety of [their] neighbors' children,” and “a threat to the health and safety of the community of\nLake Conroe Hills subdivision as a whole.” 1 These admissions wrought a two-fold effect. First,\nbeing classified as judicial in nature, the admissions prevented the Beckhams from offering any\nevidence at trial that contradicted them. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449946\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449946/horizoncms-healthcare-corporation-v-auld/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n905 (Tex.2000); Marshall v.

Second, they also relieved\nthe trial court from the obligation of submitting an issue to the jury on the topic. Horizon/CMS\nHealthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 905.\n\n *3 Thus, to the extent that the trial court admitted the pictures alluded to above “for the purposes\nof ... the question of nuisance,” it erred. Simply put, the Beckhams were prohibited from tendering\nevidence that contradicted their admission that they created a nuisance. Horizon/CMS Healthcare\nCorp. v. Auld, supra; Marshall v. Vise, supra. And, since they were barred from tendering it, the\ntrial court could not admit it.\n\nMoreover, having admitted the existence of a nuisance, the Beckhams were not entitled to the\nsubmission of, nor was the Association obligated to request, a jury issue on the matter. Horizon/\nCMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, supra. Rather, the circumstance afforded the trial court no avenue\nother than to direct a verdict finding that a nuisance existed. Simply put, the admissions resolved\nany factual dispute regarding, and established the Association's right to, judgment as a matter of\nlaw on the claim. See Rudolph v. ABC Pest Control, Inc,. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461638\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461638/rudolph-v-abc-pest-control-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 932 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 1989, writ denied) (stating that a directed verdict is proper if the evidence conclusively\nproves facts that establish a party's right to judgment as a matter of law).\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nFinally, we conclude that the errors were harmful. This is so because the jury determined that no\nnuisance arose, and judgment was entered on that verdict. Had it not been for the errors, the jury\ncould not have had the opportunity to so rule.\n\n\n\n                                 Issues 6, 7, 8, and 11-Erection of Tower\n\nThe next issues which we address, namely six, seven, eight, and eleven, involve the erection of\nthe metal tower. Through them, the Association argues that the trial court erred when it refused\nto 1) direct a verdict or grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict finding that the construction\nof the tower without advance approval from the Association violated the deed restrictions and\n2) submit a jury instruction informing the jurors that the words “building” and “structure” were\nsynonymous. It is also contended that the jury's verdict that said construction did not violate the\nrestrictions lacks evidentiary support. We overrule each point.\n\nThe particular restriction in dispute is found in paragraph “1” of the document and provides that:\n         No building shall be erected, placed or altered on any lot, property or area in\n         this subdivision until the building plans, specifications and plot plans showing\n         the location of such building have been approved in writing by LAKE CONROE\n         HILLS LIMITED, or its designated representative, or such architectural control\n         committee as may be established, as to conformity and harmony of external and\n         structural design and quality with existing structures in the subdivision and as to\n         the location of the building and in conformity with the declarations, reservations,\n         protective covenants, limitations, conditions and restrictions, as hereinafter set out.\n\n\n(Emphasis added). Given the wording utilized in paragraph 1, we must first conclude that the tower\nconstituted a building before we can sustain the Association's issues. This we cannot do.\n\n *4 Deed restrictions are subject to the same rules of interpretation applicable to contracts. Pilarcik\nv.

With this said, we turn to the words before us.\n\nThe term “building” commonly denotes “a structure” having “a roof and walls.” Webster's\nRevised Unabridged Dictionary (1998). On the other hand, the word “structure” usually denotes\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     5\n\fCommunity Imp. Ass'n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n“something ... that is constructed” or “arranged in a definite pattern.” Id. Given this, one can\nreadily see that though the two words may be related, they are not the same. While a building\ncan be considered a structure for it is “something that is constructed” and “arranged in a definite\npattern,” not everything that can be built in a definite pattern is a building. For instance, the water\nfountain appearing at the entrance of Texas Tech University is unquestionably constructed and\nmost definitely arranged in a certain pattern but it has no walls or roof. So, while one could\nreasonably consider it a structure, it could hardly be deemed a building. And, this leads us to hold\nthat the words “structure” and “building” are not per se synonymous.\n\nFurthermore, our holding is further supported by the deed restrictions themselves. In paragraph\n3(G) of same there appears the following:\n         Except for townhouses and multi-family dwellings ... no building or structure shall\n         be erected on any lot nearer than four ... feet including roof overhang from an\n         interior lot line....\n\n\n(Emphasis added). As can be seen, both the words “building” and “structure” are used. What\nmakes this significant is the rule requiring us to give meaning to every word contained in the\ndocument.

So, due to the fact\nthat the individual who drafted the restrictions included both words in the paragraph, authority\ncompels us to presume that the drafter intended the words have different meanings.\n\nIn view of our foregoing observations, we cannot but find that the trial court acted properly in\nrefusing to instruct the jury that “building” and “structure” meant the same thing. 2 Nor can one\nwho sees the pictures of the metal tower contained in the record deny that the item lacked both walls\nand a roof. And, because it lacked such characteristics, it was within the province of the jury to\nconclude that the tower was not a “building” as that term is commonly understood. Consequently,\nthe trial court had basis upon which to refuse to submit the instruction sought by the Association,\nand some evidence existed to support the jury's finding that the Beckhams did not violate paragraph\n1 by failing to obtain approval as a condition precedent to erecting the tower.\n\n\n\n                                   Issues 9 and 10-Construction Period\n\n *5 In their ninth and tenth issues, the Association complains of a partial directed verdict granted\nin favor of the Beckhams. Through it, the trial court found that the six-month construction period\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       6\n\fCommunity Imp. Ass'n of Lake Conroe Hills, Inc. v. Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\nmentioned in paragraph 3(J) of the deed restrictions only applied to new construction, as opposed to\nalterations or additions to an existing residence. And, since the Beckhams were simply modifying\nan existing home, the trial court refused to ask the jury if the Beckhams violated 3(J) and instead\ndirected a verdict on the matter. We sustain the Association's ninth issue and overrule the tenth.\n\nParagraph 3(J) provides:\n         CONSTRUCTION. All materials used in the exterior construction of any residence\n         or other structure must be approved by Lake Conroe Hills Limited or its assigns or\n         nominees before any structure may be erected and only new construction materials\n         may be used except for used brick. No concrete blocks shall be used in said\n         construction and all buildings shall be built on a slab or solid concrete beam\n         foundation or standing on concrete blocks. In no event shall any old house or\n         building be moved on any lot or lots in said subdivision. The exterior construction\n         of any kind and character, be it the primary residence, garage, porches, or\n         appendages thereto, shall be completed within six (6) months after the start of\n         foundation.\n\n\n(Emphasis added). As can be seen, nothing in the provision expressly limits the application of the\nitalicized sentence to new construction. Moreover, the plain wording of that sentence belies any\nnotion that the restriction merely encompasses only the construction of new houses. Indeed, we\ncannot ignore the fact that the person who drafted the restrictions used the phrase “of any kind and\ncharacter” to describe the type of exterior construction subject to the six-month period. Simply put,\nexterior construction “of any kind and character” is all encompassing. And, that the person who\ndrafted the deed restrictions may have referred to the alteration of existing structures elsewhere in\nthe document but omitted the term in the italicized sentence does not convince us otherwise. This\nis due to the inherent breadth of the word “any.” “Any” means, in the context before us, “all.” So,\nwhen exterior construction “of any kind and character” must be completed within six months, the\npassage cannot reasonably be read as meaning only “some” types of construction.\n\nMoreover, to adopt the Beckhams' interpretation of the phrase would lead to an absurd result. For\ninstance, those building a new home would have to complete the exterior within six months. Yet,\nif one sought to make extensive additions or alterations to the exterior of an existing house (e.g.\nadditions increasing the size of the house two-fold) he could take as many years as he chose to\nfinish the job and, consequently, keep the external appearance of his property in unsightly disarray\nas long as he chose. That makes no sense, and we cannot accord an absurd meaning to the words\nof a document. Criswell v.

Beckham, Not Reported in S.W.3d...\n\n\n\n *6 In sum, we find that the six-month restriction was not intended to apply and cannot reasonably\nbe read as applying only to the construction of a new house. Instead, it encompassed additions\nand alterations to the exterior of an existing house. And, since the record indisputably revealed\nthat the Beckhams failed to complete the exterior portion of the alterations to their home within\nsix months of their initiation, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Beckhams\non the matter. This very same indisputable evidence also leads us to conclude that there was no\nneed to ask the jury if the deed restriction had been violated. Again, a jury need not be asked about\nissues which involve no factual dispute. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, supra. Thus, we\nreject the Association's contention that such an issue had to be submitted to the jury. Finally, we\nhold that the error committed viz the partial directed verdict was harmful since it deprived the\nAssociation of opportunity to recover upon one of its claims.\n\n\n\n                              Issue 13-Civil Damages and Attorney's Fees\n\nIn its final issue, the Association asserts that the trial court erred in failing to award it civil damages\nand attorney's fees. We sustain the issue.\n\nA court may assess civil damages for the violation of a restrictive covenant in an amount not to\nexceed $200 for each day of the violation. TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 202.004(c) (Vernon 1995).\nHowever, since the language of the statute is permissive in nature, the award of such damages is\nleft to the trial court's discretion. Air Park-Dallas Zoning Committee v. Crow-Billingsley Air Park,\nLtd., 109 S.W.3d at 912. At bar, the trial court did not consider the assessment of civil damages\nbecause the jury found there was no violation of the deed restrictions. Since we have determined\nthat the six-month time period in paragraph 3(J) of the restrictions was violated, the case should\nbe remanded for a determination of the civil damages to be awarded, if any.\n\nNext, the award of attorney's fees is not discretionary. Instead, the legislature stated that the trial\ncourt “shall allow [attorney's fees] to a prevailing party who asserted” an action for breach of\na restrictive covenant pertaining to realty. TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 5.006(a) (Vernon 2004).\nNevertheless, it lies within the trial court's bailiwick to determine the reasonableness of the fees\nfor we cannot find facts.

Therefore, we must remand the issue of attorney's fees\nto the trial court as well.\n\nIn summary, we reverse the judgment to the extent it denies the Association recovery upon its claim\nof nuisance and the claim involving the violation of paragraph 3(J) of the deed restrictions and\nrender judgment in favor of the Association upon those two claims. We next reverse and remand\nthat portion of the judgment denying the Association damages and attorney's fees and awarding\nthe Beckhams their costs of court. In all other things, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                        8\n\fCommunity Imp.

TRC contracted with TRC International to manufacture certain products in Mexico,\nand TRC provided equipment to TRC International, including heaters with open flames. The\ndefendants were TRC's insurers. During the pendency of the insurance policy, a fire at the Mexico\nplant killed a number of employees, including plaintiffs' decedents. TRC made a demand on the\ndefendants for defense and indemnity, and defendants denied coverage.\n\nIn 1992, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against TRC and TRC International in Maverick\nCounty, Texas district court. In May 1993, defendants sued TRC and plaintiffs in federal court,\nseeking a declaration of non-coverage in the wrongful death suit. Service was attempted on\nplaintiffs' lawyer, who refused service. In September 1993, TRC filed for bankruptcy protection.\nIn January 1995, plaintiffs obtained a judgment against TRC. In September 1995, the federal\ncourt ruled that *3 defendants had no duty to defend or indemnify TRC. This judgment was later\naffirmed by the Fifth Circuit. In January 1996, TRC assigned to plaintiffs “any and all claims,\ndemands, and causes of action they have against Defendants.” In December 1997, plaintiffs sued\nthe defendants in Maverick County district court to collect on the wrongful death judgment. After\na bench trial, the court found in favor of plaintiffs and awarded judgment for the full amount of\nthe insurance policy, plus prejudgment interest.\n\n\n\n                                        “POLICY TERRITORY”\n\nIn their first issue on appeal, defendants assert the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiffs'\nclaims in the wrongful death action arose within the “policy territory” as that phrase is used in\nthe policy.\n\n\nThe Policy\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Defendants assert the policy covers only\nproducts intended for use or consumption in the United States. Therefore, defendants conclude,\nan accident occurring in Mexico arising out of a product intended for use in Mexico is not within\nthe “policy territory,” and thus not covered.\n\n\nRules of construction\n [1] [2] [3] Insurance contracts are subject to the same rules of construction as other contracts.\nState Farm Life Ins.

An insurer\nwho relies on an exclusion carries the burden to prove that it applies. TEX. INS.CODE ANN. art.\n21.58(b) (Vernon Supp.2001).\n\n\nAnalysis\n [10] Plaintiffs argue that the definition of “policy territory” places two limitations upon the\ninsured's actions in selling its product in order for coverage to exist for product claims arising\noutside the country. The first limitation, on the nature of the sale, requires that the product must be\n“sold for use or consumption.” The second limitation, on the location of the sale, requires that the\nsale occur within the United States, its territories or possessions, or Canada. Plaintiffs conclude that\n“within the territory described” modifies both “sold” and “for use and consumption.” We disagree.\n\nPlaintiffs' reading grammatically strains the language, because it reads the adverbial phrase as\nmodifying the distant verb “sold” rather than the prepositional phrase “for use or consumption”\nimmediately preceding it. Moreover, this reading renders “for use or consumption” as surplusage,\nas there would be coverage for any sale in the United States or Canada, regardless of where the\nproduct sold was used or consumed. Therefore, we hold that the policy is not ambiguous and the\nphrase “within the territory described” modifies “for use or consumption” and not “sold.” See\ngenerally Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v.

In six issues, Contreras attacks whether a material fact existed, whether\nthe submitted expert's opinion was relevant, and whether Appellees were entitled to rely on their\naffirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nOn July 8, 2003, Irma Contreras had gastric bypass surgery, which Appellees paid for. She then\nlost over one hundred pounds, prompting Dr. Dale Reynolds to recommend that Contreras undergo\nfive surgical procedures, which he believed were medically necessary, that consisted of excision\nof excessive skin and subcutaneous tissues of the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, breasts, and arms.\nAppellees, however, refused to pay for those surgeries, claiming that they were cosmetic. In\nresponse, Contreras sued Appellees for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and engaging\nin unfair settlement practices.\n\nAfter much negotiation, the parties settled the dispute and signed a settlement agreement.\nAccording to the terms of the agreement, Appellees agreed to pay the costs for the five surgeries\nrecommended by Dr. Reynolds, including a sixth surgery for lipectomy, and any complications\nresulting therefrom. The settlement agreement also stated that in consideration for the sums paid\nby Appellees, Contreras would release, acquit and forever discharge Appellees from any and all\nclaims, demands, and causes of actions growing out of, resulting from, or connected in any way\nwith those claims constituting the subject matter of the lawsuit. In addition, Contreras executed\nan Agreed Order of Dismissal with prejudice for her causes of action against Appellees.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 1188\n\n *416 Six months after receiving the surgeries listed in the settlement agreement, Dr. Miller\ninformed Contreras that an additional four revision surgeries were needed due to skin laxity. Those\nsurgeries included revision of excess skin of the thigh, revision of excision of excess skin of the\nleft arm, revision of excess skin of the abdomen, and revision of suction assisted lipectomy of the\ntrunk. And on March 9, 2007, Dr. Miller performed ten surgical procedures for skin laxity, which\nhe believed were medically necessary. However, Appellees refused to pay for those procedures,\nclaiming that they were cosmetic and did not arise from complications from the previous surgeries.\n\nConsequently, on January 6, 2009, Contreras filed suit against Appellees, claiming breach of\ncontract. In essence, Contreras argued that her revision surgeries were complications arising\nfrom her previous surgeries, and therefore, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Appellees\nwere obligated to pay for them. In response, Appellees moved for summary judgment, alleging\naffirmative defenses of accord and satisfaction, release, and res judicata, and that they did not\nbreach the settlement agreement as Contreras' revision surgeries were not complications resulting\nfrom the previous surgeries. In support of their motion, Appellees attached a letter and affidavit by\nDr. Henderson, which opined that the revision surgeries performed were cosmetic in nature and\nwere not due to any complications resulting from the previous surgeries. Contreras responded to\nAppellees' motions for summary judgment by attaching an affidavit from Dr. Miller, which stated\nthat the surgeries were medically necessary. After entertaining arguments on the matter, the trial\ncourt granted Appellees' motion, finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be\nresolved.\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\nContreras now raises six issues for our review. Issue One alleges that a material fact existed as to\nwhether the revision surgeries resulted from previous surgical complications. Issues Two, Three,\nand Four challenge whether Appellees' summary-judgment evidence was legally sufficient to\ndefeat Contreras' breach-of-contract claim. And Issues Five and Six contest whether the trial court\nerred by granting summary judgment on Appellees' claims for accord and satisfaction, release, and\nres judicata.

Thus, he concluded that “the revision surgeries\nperformed by me were medically necessary and not for cosmetic purposes.” However, the issue\nbefore the trial court was not whether the surgeries were medically necessary to achieve the\nobjective of reducing the amount of loose skin, but whether the surgeries were due to complications\narising out of the previous surgeries. Although the affidavit explained why Dr. Miller believed\nthe surgeries were medically necessary, it did not state that the necessity arose from medical\ncomplications from the previous surgeries. In short, Dr. Miller's affidavit did not controvert\nAppellees' medical expert's opinion, stating that the revision surgeries were not the result of any\ncomplications resulting from the previous surgeries.\n\n [2] Contreras also asserts that Dr. Henderson's letter provided an inference that her revision\nsurgeries were due to complications.

Indeed, nothing in his letter opinion or affidavit establishes that loose\nskin is a complication from such a surgery. According to the definition of “complication,” which\nDr. Henderson provided to the trial court, a postoperative complication is a “hematoma, wound\nbreakdown or dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, stroke, infection or death.” Loose\nskin, according to the summary judgment record, has never been included within that category.\nThus, we decline, as did the trial court, to infer that Dr. Henderson's letter could establish that\nContreras' additional revision surgeries were due to surgical complications.\n\nIn summary, because Contreras produced no evidence controverting Appellees' expert evidence\nthat her revision surgeries were not due to complications, we hold that the trial court did not err by\nholding no material fact existed as to whether the *418 complained-of surgical procedures were\ncomplications encompassed by the settlement agreement.

She argues that Dr.\nHenderson's opinion concerning whether insurance companies generally cover second revision\nsurgeries and whether Dr. Miller should be paid for such surgeries was not relevant to the meaning\nof the term “complication” as used in the settlement agreement. Rather, Contreras alleges that those\nstatements go to the interpretation of an insurance contract or to the standard of care governing Dr.\nMiller's ability to charge for the revision surgeries. They do not, according to Contreras, ascribe\na meaning to the term “complication” as that term is interpreted within the medical community\nand thus the settlement agreement.\n\n [3] [4] The parties did not define the term “complication” in the settlement agreement. Although\nextrinsic evidence is generally not admissible to vary the terms of an unambiguous agreement,\nextrinsic evidence may “be admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning consistent with\nthat to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to ‘interpret’ contractual terms.” Mescalero\nEnergy, Inc. v.

Therefore, whether complications arose from\nthe surgical procedures performed on Contreras and more specifically, whether excess skin is a\ncomplication from those previous surgeries, would require expert testimony as that is not within\nthe realm of lay knowledge and experience.\n\n [5] And here, Dr. Henderson did provide a medical definition of “complication” by stating that\na complication is a “hematoma, wound breakdown or dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, heart\nattack, stroke, infection or death.” As noted by Appellees, that definition is found on the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina's website. See After Surgery: Discomforts and Complications,\navailable at http://www.muschealth. com/gs/healthtopic.aspx?action=showpage&pageid=P01390\n(last visited Aug. 8, 2011). Moreover, Dr. Henderson opined that Contreras' loose skin was not\na complication arising from the surgical procedures performed. These are not matters within\nthe realm of lay knowledge and experience. In other words, Dr. Henderson's definition of\n“complication,” as that term is interpreted within the medical community, was relevant to give\nthe settlement term a meaning consistent with that to which it was reasonably susceptible, and\nwe cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by accepting Dr. Henderson's definition\nof complication.

Moreover, to the extent that Contreras argues that Appellees failed to\nprovide any definition in their summary judgment motion that supported Dr. Henderson's view\nthat the revision surgeries were not due to complications from the previous surgeries, our review\nof the record has found two such definitions cited by Appellees: (1) that a “complication is an\nunexpected medical event directly resulting from the performance of a surgery ... [which include]\nshock, hemorrhage, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary complications, urinary\nretention and reaction to anesthesia;” and (2) that a “surgical complication is any undesirable,\nunintended, and direct result of surgery affecting the patient which would not have occurred had\nthe surgery gone as well as could reasonably be hoped.” The first definition appears on the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina's website, and the second definition comes from the World Journal\nof Surgery. Thus, Contreras' arguments on these grounds fail.\n\n [6] Contreras further asks us to apply her own definition of complication as found at an online\nmedical cite, www.medicinenet.com. However, Contreras did not present her definition to the\ntrial court. “Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or other\nresponse” to the motion for summary judgment “shall not be considered on appeal as grounds\nfor reversal.” TEX.R.

And because\nthere was no evidence that Appellees breached the settlement agreement, Appellees contended\nthat Contreras' additional revision surgeries were new surgeries from which Contreras already\nagreed to financially release Appellees from. Thus, Appellees' affirmative defenses of accord and\nsatisfaction, release, and res judicata were not only relevant to Contreras' breach-of-contract claim,\nbut also specifically tailored to that claim in their motion.

After bench trial, the 141st District Court, Tarrant County, Len A. Wade, J., entered\njudgment in favor of dealer but denied recovery of dealer's attorney fees. Manufacturer appealed\nand dealer cross-appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Anne Gardner, J., held that:\n\n[1] “best efforts” provision of agreement was not so vague as to be unenforceable;\n\n[2] evidence was legally sufficient to support finding that manufacturer breached best efforts\nprovision, which required manufacturer to use best efforts to resolve administrative protest by\nthird party;\n\n[3] evidence was legally sufficient to support finding that manufacturer and dealer intended to\nretain the right to actual damages for breach of sales agreement;\n\n[4] dealer's experts' reliance on manufacturer's planning potential did not render experts' opinions\nunreliable;\n\n[5] prejudgment interest accrued from date of demand letter for damages expressly referencing\nand demanding damages for breach of contract at issue; and\n\n[6] provision of contract that non-breach party's sole remedy in a breach of contract claim would be\nout-of-pocket expenses that could not be mitigated did not preclude dealer's recovery of statutory\nattorney's fees.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BACKGROUND\n\n[1] Chrysler manufactures Chrysler, Dodge, Dodge Truck, and Jeep motor vehicles. Tommy\nManuel has been a franchised automobile dealer in the Dallas–Fort Worth area for forty-seven\nyears, including twenty-five years as a franchised Chrysler and Dodge dealer in Fort Worth and\nRichardson. At the time of trial, Tommy Manuel owned or controlled at least nine motor vehicle\ndealerships in the Dallas–Fort Worth market.\n\n\nA. Historical Backdrop\nIn the mid–1990s, as number three of the “Big Three” in that day, Chrysler developed a market\nrealignment plan called “Project 2000” to reorganize, relocate, and establish more motor vehicle\ndealerships to improve sales in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and to better compete with its rivals,\nFord and General Motors. As an essential part of Project 2000, Chrysler sought to have its various\nDallas–Fort Worth franchised dealers agree to waive their rights to protest the establishment or\nrelocation of other dealerships in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n\nTexas and other states closely regulate the distribution and sale of automobiles. In response to the\nsuperiority of economic power and bargaining strength of American automobile manufacturers\nin their relationships with dealers that had developed by the 1950s, with dealers completely\ndependent upon those manufacturers for their supply of automobiles, Congress 3 and state\nlegislatures enacted regulatory schemes to protect retail dealers from perceived abusive and\noppressive acts by the manufacturers. 4 In accord with the policy of protecting dealers and\nconsumers, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a California statute\nthat prohibited manufacturers from relocating or adding new dealerships to their market areas\nwhere the effect of such added competition would be injurious to existing franchisees and to the\npublic interest. 5 The Court held that a state may, consistent with due process, provide that the\nfiling of a protest by an existing dealer can, without a prior hearing, prevent another dealer from\nrelocating or establishing a new dealership in the existing dealer's defined market area until after\na hearing and resolution of the protest. 6\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Complicating matters in this case, the TMVC provides that any agreement waiving terms\nof the TMVC is void and unenforceable. 12\n\n\nB. Project 2000\nBy mid-July of 1999, after several years of efforts to obtain agreements for the realignment of\nthe Dallas–Fort Worth market from its various dealers in the area, Chrysler had circulated and\nobtained settlement agreements, including waivers of the right to protest, from each of the Dallas–\nFort Worth area dealers participating in Project 2000, with the exception of Manuel. Manuel was\naware of Chrysler's plan but was not originally a Project 2000 participant for several reasons.\nChrysler had litigation pending against one of Manuel's dealerships (and other dealerships in Texas\nand California) for allegedly seeking fraudulent warranty credits from Chrysler for engine cores\n(the Cores litigation), and Manuel had a protest against Chrysler pending before the Commission\narising out of the Cores litigation. Additionally, Manuel had bought and operated for twenty-five\nyears a successful dealership in Richardson with a “trip,” that is, three lines—Chrysler, Dodge car,\nand Dodge truck. Chrysler had been trying to buy the Chrysler line from Manuel for many years,\nand he had refused to sell it. Chrysler desired the Chrysler line to keep Manuel from protesting\nother dealers in that market area as well as to give that “point” to another dealer to complete\nthe Project 2000 market realignment. Chrysler approached Manuel last regarding Project 2000\nbecause it knew that Manuel would *168 be the most expensive to deal with. Joe Park, Chrysler's\nDallas zone manager at the time, recalled at trial, “We had to get him out of the way.”\n\nIn mid-August 1999, during a meeting of Dodge truck dealers in San Antonio, Chrysler\nrepresentatives from Detroit and the Dallas zone office met with Manuel about joining Project\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Chrysler offered Manuel $5 million for his Chrysler\nline at the Richardson dealership, and Manuel bargained for $15 million and another dealership\nto replace it. The parties discussed possible locations for an additional dealership, and Park told\nManuel that the other dealers had signed waivers of the right to protest relocations or additional\ndealerships in joining Project 2000. By the end of August 1999, the two parties had arrived at a\ncomprehensive agreement.\n\n\nC. The Agreements\nManuel signed two written agreements dated August 31, 1999, after reviewing them with his\nattorney (who had represented him in the Cores litigation). One was a settlement and release\nagreement (the Settlement Agreement) similar to those entered into with the other dealers\nparticipating in Project 2000. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Chrysler paid Manuel $15.34\nmillion to settle the Cores litigation, to relinquish the Chrysler line at his Richardson dealership,\nand to waive any right to protest the other dealers involved in Project 2000. The second agreement,\nattached to and referenced in the Settlement Agreement, was titled “Agreement to Enter into\nSales and Service Agreement” (the AESSA). By the AESSA, Chrysler agreed to enter into a\nfranchise agreement with Manuel for a new Chrysler–Jeep dealership in South Arlington (the\nSouth Arlington dealership), conditioned upon Manuel providing the land, building the facility,\nand furnishing the capital investment for the new dealership by January 1, 2001.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement stated that the South Arlington dealership was “subject to the\npossibility that it may be protested” by another dealer and that a protest “can significantly delay the\nestablishment or relocation of the dealership subject to the protest.” The AESSA in turn provided\nthat, in the event of a protest against the South Arlington dealership, Chrysler would “use its best\nefforts to litigate or settle the protest or lawsuit in order to allow the establishment of [the South\nArlington] dealership.”\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Manuel ceased selling Chrysler vehicles at\nhis Richardson dealership within thirty days after the agreements were signed in August 1999.\nAs required by the AESSA, Manuel created a new corporation (Tommy Manuel Chrysler–Jeep,\nInc.) and filed his application with the Commission for the new dealership in South Arlington in\nDecember, which was approved on January 14, 2000. Manuel purchased property for the South\nArlington dealership in April 2000.\n\n\nD. Meador's Protest\nOn January 28, 2000, Meador Chrysler–Plymouth, Inc. (Meador), one of the other dealerships that\nwas part of Project 2000 and whose dealer-principal had signed a protest waiver, filed a notice of\nprotest against the creation of the South Arlington dealership, which would be located less than\nfifteen miles from Meador's existing dealership. The filing of Meador's protest was unexpected\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   17\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v.

Chrysler moved\nto have the protest dismissed by the Commission, acting as Meador's attorney-in-fact as provided\nby Meador's settlement agreement. Failing that effort, on March 31, 2000, Chrysler filed suit\nin federal district court in the Western District of Texas, obtained a stay of the administrative\nproceeding, and sought injunctive relief and to compel arbitration of the issues raised by Meador's\nprotest. The federal court initially stayed the state administrative proceeding but, after a hearing,\ndenied all relief on June 7, 2000, abated the suit in its own court, and returned the protest\nto the Commission for resolution. Chrysler then sought and obtained permission to file an\ninterlocutory appeal of the adverse ruling and intervened in the administrative proceeding before\nthe Commission. In July 2000, Chrysler filed its appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from\nthe federal district court's adverse decision. Also in July of 2000, pursuant to a strategy agreed upon\nat a meeting between Manuel and Chrysler and their respective attorneys, Manuel filed a separate\nsuit in state court against Meador for damages resulting from the delay of the establishment of his\nnew dealership caused by Meador's protest.\n\nIn September 2000, some eight months after the protest had been filed, Chrysler had intensive\nsettlement negotiations with Meador. Chrysler ultimately settled the Meador protest in October\n2000 by giving Meador a letter of intent for an additional dealership and paying Meador $17,000 in\nattorney's fees. In November 2000, Chrysler advised Manuel to proceed with building his facility\nfor the new dealership in South Arlington, and the Meador protest was formally dismissed on\nDecember 21, 2000.\n\n\nE. This Suit\nIt was undisputed that the years 2000 and 2001 were exceptionally good years for car sales in the\nDallas–Fort Worth market, but Manuel was not able to complete and open the South Arlington\ndealership until February 2002. A significant downturn in sales and a steep decline of the American\nmarket share of automobiles began in 2002. They were continuing at the time of trial, and the new\ndealership sustained a loss for 2002 and subsequent years.\n\nIn 2004, Manuel sued Chrysler for breach of contract and other causes of action, seeking damages\ncaused by the delay in opening the South Arlington dealership as the result of Chrysler's failure to\nresolve Meador's protest, the costs Manuel incurred in litigating Meador's protest before the state\nagency and in state court, and attorney's fees. Manuel contended that Chrysler failed to use its best\nefforts as required by the AESSA to litigate or settle the Meador protest, thereby causing the delay\nin the opening of the South Arlington dealership.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The parties tried the case to the bench over a sporadic period of about six\nweeks regarding that issue and damages. Among its findings of fact, the trial court found that\nChrysler failed to use its best efforts to resolve the Meador protest and that Chrysler “breached\nthe contract.” 13 The trial court rendered *170 a final judgment awarding Manuel $370,668.50\nin damages plus prejudgment interest but denied Manuel recovery of attorney's fees. Both parties\nappealed. Chrysler seeks reversal of the trial court's judgment and rendition of a take-nothing\njudgment, and Manuel seeks remand for a new trial on the issue of attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                           III. BEST EFFORTS\n\nBy its first issue, Chrysler argues that the AESSA's best efforts clause is unenforceable because it\nlacks measurable goals and guidelines and that even if the best efforts clause is enforceable, the\ngoal of the agreement was the opening of the South Arlington dealership, meaning best efforts are\nirrelevant because that goal was ultimately met. Chrysler alternatively contends that the evidence\nconclusively established that Chrysler used its best efforts to resolve the Meador protest. 14\n\n\nA. Enforceability of “Best Efforts” Clause\n\n1.

In that\ncase, CKB had agreed to use its best efforts to refine crude oil into specific volumes of refined\nproducts, as set out in the agreement in a schedule specifying percentages of total refinery output\nfor each product. Id. at 578. Instead of refining the crude oil to produce the quantities specified in\nthe contract, CKB operated the refinery to produce the highest dollar yield on the crude. Id. at 579,\n582. Moore McCormack sued CKB for breach of contract, and the trial court rendered summary\njudgment in Moore McCormacks favor. Id. at 580. CKB appealed. Id.\n\nAs Chrysler points out, the CKB court described the provision for “best efforts” in a contract\nas a nebulous standard.... Under some circumstances, a party could use best efforts to achieve a\ncontractual goal and fall well short. Under different circumstances, an effort well short of ones\nbest may suffice to hit a target. See id. at 581. Thus, that court reasoned, “To be enforceable,\na best efforts contract must set some kind of goal or guideline against which best efforts may\nbe measured.” Id. at 581–82 (citing Pinnacle Books, Inc. v.

(citing Bloor, 601 F.2d at 613–14). 15 Thus, the CKB\n *172 court did not further explore the “goal or guideline” standard.\n\nChrysler argues that the best efforts clause in the AESSA is unenforceable because it fails to set\nforth a measurable goal or guideline in that no date was specified by which Chrysler was required\nto litigate or settle the Meador protest. Manuel responds that, reading the contract as a whole,\nthe AESSA required Chrysler to settle or litigate the Meador protest in a manner that allowed\nManuel to open the South Arlington dealership on or before January 1, 2001. Manuel references\nlanguage in the AESSA stating that he was required to build and complete the facilities for the\nSouth Arlington dealership before January 1, 2001, that the establishment of the South Arlington\ndealership was of “major importance” to Chrysler, and that “time is of the essence.”\n\nIn Herrmann Holdings, Ltd. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., the contract required Lucent to use\nits “reasonable best efforts” to file registration paperwork with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) “as promptly as practicable” or “in the most expeditious manner practicable.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28414\"><a href=\"/opinion/28414/herrmann-hold-ltd-v-lucent-technol-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556 (5th Cir.2002). Rejecting the very argument by Lucent that Chrysler makes\nhere, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Herrmann Holdings's pleadings stated a claim for\nbreach of contract, significantly stating that “[r]equiring contracting parties to fix a date certain in\norder to set a temporal guideline in which to complete a certain task demands more definiteness\nthan Texas law requires.” Id. at 560 (emphasis added).\n\nHere, the best efforts provision states: “[Chrysler] will use its best efforts to litigate or settle the\nprotest or lawsuit in order to allow the establishment of [the South Arlington] dealership.” The\nbest efforts provision does not include language similar to the “as promptly as practicable” or “in\nthe most expeditious manner practicable” language in Herrmann Holdings, but the AESSA does\nspecifically and expressly contemplate establishing the South Arlington dealership by January\n1, 2001. 16 Even absent such language, we cannot interpret the best efforts provision as placing\nno deadline at all for Chrysler to litigate or settle the Meador protest because doing so reads the\nJanuary 1, 2001 deadline out of the AESSA and renders the best efforts clause itself meaningless.\nSee id. Rather, the goal or objective of the best efforts provision in the AESSA, in light of the\nagreement as a whole, was for Chrysler to use its best efforts to litigate or settle the Meador protest\nin such a period of time that Manuel could establish the South Arlington dealership by January\n1, 2001.\n\nMoreover, other courts have held enforceable “best efforts” requirements in contracts that\ncontained none of the defining language in Herrmann Holdings.

Therefore, even if the\nJanuary 1, 2001 date specified in the AESSA for opening the new dealership were not controlling\n(and it is undisputed that the protest was not resolved in time for Manuel to build his facility and\nopen for more than a year after that date), we hold that the best efforts provision in the AESSA\nhad a measurable timeline or goal of resolving any protest by settlement or litigation within a\nreasonable time and was thus enforceable. We overrule the first part of Chrysler's first issue.\n\n\nB. The Quality of Chrysler's Efforts\n [4] Chrysler next argues that, even if the best efforts clause is enforceable, the AESSA's only goal\nwas the opening of the South Arlington dealership and that because Chrysler's efforts eventually\nsettled the protest, it met the goal because the South Arlington dealership eventually opened. Thus,\nChrysler, citing Herrmann Holdings, 302 F.3d at 559, argues that the “analysis ends” and that\nwhether Chrysler used its best efforts is irrelevant. But the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Herrmann\nHoldings is again instructive in rejecting this argument. In that case, Lucent eventually filed the\nregistration paperwork with the SEC, and the SEC approved the transaction. Id. at 557. But by\nthat time, the Herrmanns had been damaged by the decline in Lucent's stock price. Id.

Analysis\nChrysler argues that the AESSA did not obligate it to pay any money to Meador and urges that\nits other efforts to resolve Meador's protest were reasonable and prudent in settling the protest\nwithin nine months. Chrysler points to evidence that its zone manager Joe Park (1) met with *175\nMeador's co-owner and sales manager (because Mr. Meador was ill and unavailable) soon after\nMeador filed its protest and urged withdrawal of the protest; (2) remained in constant contact with\nthem; (3) later talked to Mr. Meador, who would not overrule his co-owner's answer of “no”;\nand (4) finally reminded Meador's representatives that Meador's protest was a breach of Meador's\nown contractual agreement not to protest other relocations or new dealerships in Project 2000.\nBut Park never offered money to Meador to withdraw its protest because he did not think he\nneeded to since Meador had signed a contract. Park also testified that he did not think Meador\nwanted money and instead wanted to delay Manuel's dealership as long as possible. Chrysler thus\ncontinued on its litigation path, seeking to have the administrative protest dismissed, obtaining a\nstay of those proceedings, and filing suit in federal court against Meador for an injunction and to\ncompel arbitration regarding the validity of the protest.\n\nIn CKB, the Dallas court of appeals stated that “[w]hen a party misses the guidelines, courts\nmeasure the quality of its efforts by the circumstances of the case and by comparing the party's\nperformance with that of an average, prudent, comparable operator.” 809 S.W.2d at 582 (citations\nomitted). While there is evidence of the circumstances surrounding Meador's protest, of Chrysler's\nefforts to have Meador withdraw that protest (which Chrysler refers to as evidence of efforts to\nsettle), and of Chrysler's eventual settlement of the protest, the evidence is undisputed that Chrysler\nand Meador did not exchange settlement proposals until September 2000 and that they did not\nreach a settlement until October 4, 2000.\n\nThe trial court could have reasonably inferred that Chrysler wanted to “clear the market” for\nall of the dealerships participating in Project 2000 and that Chrysler's strategy was, in effect, to\nremove the protest waiver issue to federal court and seek arbitration to avoid a determination of\nthat issue by the Commission under the Texas regulatory scheme (which is not to say that such a\nstrategy was unreasonable per se). The federal district court denied injunctive relief and Chrysler's\nmotion to compel arbitration on June 7, 2000, and issued an eleven-page order explaining the\nreasons, including that the validity of the protest waiver under the terms of the TMVC was more\nappropriately for the agency to decide and that Manuel was not a party and would not be bound\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp. v.\nMeador Chrysler–Plymouth, Inc., No. A–00–CA–216–SS, at *10–11 (W. Dist. Tex. June 7, 2000).\nHence the federal court abated the suit in its own court and returned the issue to the administrative\nagency for decision. Id. 17 At least by that point, as the trial court in this case noted during closing\narguments, Chrysler must have had “some understanding” of the unlikelihood of success with\nits litigation efforts. Yet Chrysler still did nothing to settle for several more months. During that\ntime, Chrysler pursued its interlocutory *176 appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and\nstrategized with Manuel to coordinate his filing suit in state court against Meador, all of which only\nfurther delayed the resolution of the Meador protest. After settling with Meador in October 2000,\nChrysler notified Manuel that he could proceed with building his facility in November 2000, and\nthe protest was formally dismissed in December 2000. By that time, all of the other Project 2000\ndealers in the area were selling cars. But Manuel was unable to begin building his new dealership\nfacility by reason of the pending protest until after the settlement and, consequently, was not able\nto open for business until February 2002.\n\nWhat would a prudent, comparable automobile manufacturer have done? As was acknowledged\nby the parties in the Settlement Agreement, Chrysler and Manuel both knew from the outset that a\nprotest could entail significant delay, and Chrysler knew that a protest by any dealer participating\nin Project 2000 would present a significant obstacle to the accomplishment of its planned market\nrealignment. The testimony was undisputed that Chrysler had planned all along to pay dealers for\ntheir agreement not to protest for that very reason and had budgeted $50 million toward preventing\nor resolving protests such as that filed by Meador in order to implement Project 2000 in the\nDallas–Fort Worth area. Chrysler budgeted $11.2 million to pay another dealer for a protest waiver\nbut ended up paying that dealer $1 million and giving him a new point (a new dealership), and\nChrysler paid $1 million to another dealer who was not a Project 2000 participant in order to settle\na threatened protest within a few days after that dealer approached Chrysler.\n\nAlthough Chrysler offered evidence that Meador only wanted to delay Manuel's new dealership\nas long as possible, there was contradictory evidence that Meador might have been interested in a\nsettlement and that it wanted a “point”. Chrysler had two open points and a substantial remaining\nbudget of around $30 million after payments to Manuel and other dealers but did not offer either\nmoney or a point to Meador until late September 2000, so there is no way to know what Meador\nwould have accepted at an earlier date. And Chrysler's witnesses were unable to explain why\nChrysler never offered any of its multi-million dollar budget to settle the Meador protest.\n\nChrysler argues that the AESSA did not obligate it to pay any money to Meador, that it had no\ncontractual obligation to use the $50 million it had allocated to its budget to settle protests by\ndealers, and that it could simply have “ignored” settling with Meador until it had fully litigated\nits pending federal court and administrative proceedings. Chrysler reasons that Manuel's position\n(and the trial court's finding of failure to use best efforts) imposed “an additional burden” on\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Chrysler argues that its choice to litigate rather than settle was solely within\nits discretion under the AESSA, that it was entitled to exercise its legal right to enforce Meador's\nagreement to waive the statutory right to protest, and that there was no prohibition in either the\nAESSA or the Settlement Agreement against Chrysler trying to hold Meador to its agreement.\nAccording to Chrysler, punishing it for choosing to pursue litigation rather than to settle would\nstrip Chrysler of its right to access to the courts to enforce its rights.\n\nBy all of these arguments, Chrysler overlooks its agreement in the AESSA that contractually\nobligated it to use its best efforts not simply to litigate but “to litigate or settle the protest or lawsuit\nin order to allow the establishment of the South Arlington dealership.” [Emphasis *177 added].\nThe question is not whether Chrysler should have litigated, as we agree that was its right. Rather,\nthe question is when did Chrysler's choice to litigate to the exclusion of making any efforts toward\nsettlement become unreasonable. See CKB, 809 S.W.2d at 582 (stating that when a party fails to\nmeet goal or guideline, court measures quality of its efforts by circumstances and comparison of\nperformance of the prudent comparable operator); see also Herrmann Holdings, 302 F.3d at 559\n(stating court may look to circumstances of case and compare party's performance in similar cases\nin determining whether party failed to exercise best efforts).\n\nAccording to a letter from Manuel's counsel, Chrysler assured Manuel in mid-June 2000 that it\nwas going to dismiss the federal appeal and attempt to settle with Meador while Manuel filed suit\nand litigated against Meador in state court. Although Manuel did file and litigate that suit, Chrysler\nstill made no effort to settle with Meador until late September. As held by the court in CKB, “[N]o\nefforts cannot be best efforts.” See 809 S.W.2d at 582.\n\nApplying the appropriate standard of review, we hold that there is legally sufficient evidence to\nsupport the trial courts finding that Chrysler breached the best efforts provision in the AESSA.\nSee Cent. Ready Mix Concrete, 228 S.W.3d at 651; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 807, 827; see\nalso Martinez, 977 S.W.2d at 334.

LIMITATION OF DAMAGES\n\nBy its second issue, Chrysler contends that the trial court erred by awarding Manual damages\nof $370,668.50 based upon Manuel's claim for lost profits for the one-year period during which\nManuel was not able to open the South Arlington dealership. Chrysler relies upon the AESSA's\nlimitation-of-damages provision, which limits recoverable damages solely to “out-of-pocket\nexpenses that cannot be mitigated,” and argues that Manual is barred from recovering lost profits\nas damages by waiver of “incidental and consequential damages” in both the AESSA and the\nSettlement Agreement. 18 Chrysler complains that the trial court erred as a matter of law in\ndisregarding these contractual limitations of damages. Alternatively, Chrysler contends that, if\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                         26\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v.

Preservation of Error\n [6] Manuel first asks us to summarily overrule Chrysler's second issue because Chrysler failed\nto negate every basis supporting the judgment. Specifically, Manuel argues that Chrysler only\nchallenges “lost profits” but that the trial court could have rested its damage award on Manuel's\nindividual claims for lost salary and rental income for which there is evidence and which Manuel\nasserts are independent grounds not challenged on appeal.\n\n [7] Rule of appellate procedure 38.1(f) provides that “[t]he statement of an issue or point will\nbe treated as covering every subsidiary question that is fairly included.” Tex.R.App. P. 38.1(f). In\nthis regard, the Supreme Court of Texas has stated that *178 “disposing of appeals for harmless\nprocedural defects is disfavored”; that appellate courts are to construe appellate briefs “reasonably,\nyet liberally, so that the right to appellate review is not lost by waiver”; and that “appellate courts\nshould reach the merits of an appeal whenever reasonably possible.” Perry v. Cohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895064\"><a href=\"/opinion/895064/perry-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 (Tex.2008).\n\nWhile Chrysler's second issue discusses the damages awarded in short-hand form as “lost profits,”\nChrysler's overarching contention is that the limitation-of-damages clause of the AESSA limits\nManuel's damages to out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated. 19 None of Manuel's\ndamage claims—whether for lost profits, lost owner's salary, or lost rental income—are for out-of-\npocket expenses; each claim seeks recovery of benefit-of-the-bargain damages as if the contract\nhad been performed.

Although the AESSA limits Chrysler's liability for breach of that agreement to\n“out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be mitigated,” the Settlement Agreement states that it applies\nto any breach of that agreement or the AESSA, that it prevails to the extent of any conflict with the\nAESSA, and that “[t]he parties remain liable for any actual damages.” [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n *183 3. Lost Profits May Be Direct or Consequential Damages\n [16] There is no bright-line rule that lost profits always constitute consequential damages under\nthe common law (as Chrysler seems to contend), and Chrysler's cases holding that lost profits\nare consequential damages are not persuasive. For example, Tooke v. City of Mexia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400009/tooke-v-city-of-mexia/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329 (Tex.2006), did not involve common law consequential damages but instead interpreted\nsection 271.153 of the Texas Local Government Code, which limits recovery to the “balance due\nand owing” under a contract with a city plus interest, thereby excluding recovery under that statute\nfor all lost profits as consequential damages. 22\n\nIn Leahy, 132 S.W.3d at 475, also relied upon by Chrysler, the limitation-of-damages provision\nexpressly excluded recovery for “lost profits,” both direct or consequential. Neither the AESSA\nnor the Settlement Agreement in this case even mentions “lost profits,” nor do the limitation-of-\ndamages provisions purport to allocate that risk to either party, even though the lost profits were the\nonly type of damages that Manuel would likely suffer from a significant delay caused by a protest\nfrom another dealer and that very risk was expressly mentioned in the Settlement Agreement and\naddressed by both the Settlement Agreement and the AESSA. Courts have construed limitation-\nof-damages clauses to preclude both direct and consequential lost profits where the clauses\nexpressly waived damages for either lost profits or consequential damages, but have held that\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Compare id.

See 305 S.W.3d at 315.\nIn that case, a long-term contract for purchase of gas to operate a cogeneration facility contained a\nprovision allowing the buyer to use the gas to operate the facility or to resell the gas to third parties.\nId. at 311. When the seller failed to deliver the required volumes of gas as the claimed result of\nweather disruptions, the buyer sued for damages based on the difference between the amount it\nwould have to pay under the contract and the much higher amount that it would have received by\nselling the gas to third parties during that *184 period. Id. at 311–12. The seller contended that\nthe damages amounted to lost profits waived by the clause prohibiting recovery of consequential\ndamages, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the seller. Id. at 312. The Houston\nFourteenth Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the lost profits from the buyer's\ninability to resell gas not delivered to customers at the higher market value were “direct” damages\nnot precluded by the waiver of “consequential” damages contained in the contract. Id. at 314–15.\nHolding that the contract was not a sale of goods controlled by the UCC, the court used the common\nlaw definition of “consequential damages” and held that, by the parties' express agreement that\nthe buyer could resell the gas to a third party, the contract thereby implicitly authorized the buyer\nto profit from increases in the market price of the gas; thus, any wrongful interference with that\ncontract right “would naturally and necessarily cause [the buyer] to suffer direct damages in the\nform of profits on the [a]greement itself.” 24 Id. at 315 & n. 11. Thus, depending on the unique\ncircumstances of each case, including the specific language of the contract, lost profits may be\ndirect or consequential damages.\n\n\n4. Ambiguity Concerning Recoverable Damages\n\n\n                            a. Conflict Concerning Recoverable Damages\n\n [17] Considering the contracts together, the AESSA limits Chrysler's liability to out-of-pocket\nexpenses, but the Settlement Agreement provides that it “prevails” to the extent of any conflict\nwith the AESSA and states that the parties “remain liable for any actual damages.” The first and\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The second conflict is between the retention of liability for “any actual damages” and the\nwaiver of consequential damages, both within the same paragraph of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nChrysler attempts to reconcile the obvious conflict between the limitation to “out-of-pocket\nexpenses” in the AESSA and the retention of liability for “actual damages” in the Settlement\nAgreement by focusing on a waiver of “consequential” damages contained in both agreements.\nChrysler argues that the lost profits damages awarded to Manuel are barred from recovery under\nboth agreements as “consequential damages” because they constituted only anticipated lost income\nfrom collateral contracts, that is, retail sales that Manuel claimed his new dealership could have\nmade to third parties during its first year of operation had it opened on time. But as discussed\nabove, lost profits are not per se consequential damages solely because sales to third parties are\ninvolved. See, e.g., Cherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314–15.\n\nChrysler also posits that one measure of direct “actual damages” is “out-of-pocket expenses” and\nthat interpreting the retention of liability for “actual damages” so as to allow Manuel's recovery\nonly of out-of-pocket expenses (by reason of the waiver of consequential damages) is consistent\nwith the limitation of damages in the AESSA to out-of-pocket expenses. While this *185\nproposed construction superficially harmonizes the two clauses, the limitation-of-damages clause\nin the AESSA already uses the term “out-of-pocket expenses.” It is not reasonable to interpret both\nterms, that is, “actual damages” and “out-of-pocket expenses,” to have the same meaning as that\nwould render one or the other term meaningless or redundant.

And it\nbears repeating that lost profits are not per se consequential damages solely because there will be\na subsequent sale to third parties. See, e.g., Cherokee Cnty., 305 S.W.3d at 314–15.\n\nChrysler's proposed interpretation—that the more specific waiver of consequential *186 damages\ncontrols over the more general term “actual damages,” meaning Manuel may only recover lost\nprofits that are “direct damages”—is reasonable. But this does not end our analysis because\nChrysler's interpretation is not the only reasonable interpretation of the agreements. Manuel\ncontends that the two agreements are ambiguous because they conflict on their face when read\ntogether. 26 Specifically, Manuel points out that the Settlement Agreement expressly provides\nthat it “prevails” in the event of a conflict with the AESSA and that the Settlement Agreement's\nlimitation of damages provision expressly states that it applies to a breach of the AESSA. Manuel\nalso points to the inherent conflict between the Settlement Agreement's purported waiver of\nconsequential damages and simultaneous retention of liability for any actual damages. Given these\nconflicts and the provisions in the AESSA that time was of the essence and that Chrysler had\nthe obligation to use its best efforts to litigate or settle any protest so that the South Arlington\ndealership could open by January 1, 2001, Manuel's interpretation of the agreements—preserving\nthe right to recover any actual damages—is also reasonable.\n\nAfter applying the applicable rules of interpretation and considering all of the circumstances\nsurrounding the execution of the agreements; the lack of specific waiver of lost profits in either\nagreement; and the lack of any definition of consequential, compensatory, or actual damages,\nwe are left with terms that remain subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. They are\ntherefore ambiguous as a matter of law, and we hold that the trial court did not err by implicitly\nfinding that the contracts are ambiguous.\n\n\n\n                                      b. Evidence of Parties' Intent\n\n [18] While the trial court did not make an explicit conclusion of law that the contract was\nambiguous, it implicitly did so because it made a finding of fact that the parties “intended to retain\nthe right to actual damages.” Chrysler argues in the last part of its second issue that there is no\nevidence to support the trial court's finding of the parties' intent because no witness provided parol\nevidence of the parties' intent concerning the damage waiver provisions since neither Manuel's\nattorney nor Chrysler's attorney—the only persons who drafted or negotiated wording changes in\nthe agreements—were asked any questions on this topic and because no changes were made in\nthe damage limitations in the agreements.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Moreover, parties do not ordinarily contract with reference to what happens if\nthere is a breach. “Parties generally have their minds addressed to performance of contracts—not\nto their breach or the consequences which will follow a breach.” See 24 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts § 64:15 (4th ed. 1999).\n\nIn this case, there is legally sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the parties\nintended to retain the right to actual damages, even though there is not specific testimony of\ntheir subjective intent regarding the limitation of damages provisions. That evidence included\nthe agreements themselves; the circumstances surrounding Chrysler's planning, negotiations, and\nimplementation of Project 2000; the sophistication and longstanding relationship of the parties;\nthe parties' negotiations; Chrysler's need for franchised dealers to be able to sell Chrysler's motor\nvehicles to the public; the purpose of the agreement for a franchise, which was for both Chrysler\nand Manuel to make profits from car sales; the overriding importance to success of the marketing\nplan such that each participating dealer agreed to waive the right to protest another dealer; and,\nfinally, the recognition by both parties that a protest might nevertheless be made and result in\nsignificant delay in opening the new dealership. 27\n\nChrysler agreed in the AESSA to grant a franchise to Manuel, and the AESSA specifically set forth\nChrysler's “planning potential” for Manuel's new dealership as 1,076 vehicles to be supplied by\nChrysler in the new dealership's first year so that Manuel could resell those vehicles to consumers.\nAs conditions required for Chrysler to grant Manuel the franchise, Manuel was to acquire suitable\nland for the construction of the dealership and provide building and site plans to be approved by\nChrysler for a facility—the minimum requirements for which were specifically set forth (excluding\na body shop) in the AESSA as 20,350 square feet of facility including a new vehicle showroom\nfor six vehicles, a parts department of 5,500 square feet, a service department of 11,500 square\nfeet with 22 service stalls, and 110,100 square feet of total land area.

Additionally, in November 2001, Chrysler prepared for Manuel a\n“Dealer Agreement Portfolio” including a document signed by Manuel and titled “DAP–3,” which\nforecast the new dealership's *188 net profit as $702,674 for its first year of actual operation\nbased upon Chrysler's estimated “planning potential” for the new dealership's first year of actual\noperation along with parts and service, minus expenses.\n\nJim Dimond, Chrysler's national market representation manager in 2000 and whose department\ndeveloped Project 2000, testified his department determined dealer planning potential. Chrysler\npurchased data on auto registrations from all parts of the country, demographic data with\npopulation and income levels, and counts of competitive dealers in market areas. Dimond\nexplained that “planning potential” is each market's share of “forward looking financial volumes.”\nAs Dimond noted, the AESSA cautioned that planning potential was not intended to predict the\nnumber of units that the dealer would sell or that Chrysler would sell to the dealer and that number\nmight change with market conditions. Nevertheless, he admitted that Chrysler used planning\npotential for the number of anticipated sales for the first year for a new franchised-dealership\nbecause it is “the best number if we have no track record.”\n\nDimond described the South Arlington area as a growing market with a strong population and\nincreasing income where Chrysler needed to establish more “points.” Dimond explained that the\nonly way that a dealer can sell cars in the United States and the only way a manufacturer can\ndistribute cars for sale to consumers is through a franchised dealership. As relevant here, the\nTMVC defines a “franchise” as one or more contracts between a franchised dealer as franchisee\nand a manufacturer (or distributor) as franchisor, in which: “(A) the franchisee is granted the\nright to sell and service new motor vehicles manufactured or distributed by the franchisor or to\nservice motor vehicles under the contract and a manufacturer's warranty” and “(D) the franchisee's\nbusiness substantially relies on the franchisor for a continued supply of motor vehicles, parts, and\naccessories.” Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 2301.002 (West 2008).\n\nVan Gray, Chrysler's national dealer placement manager in 1998 and 1999, testified that Chrysler\nwould not have undertaken the risky venture of slating a new dealership in the South Arlington area\nunless it thought the dealership could make money. It belabors the obvious to say that Chrysler and\nManuel were sophisticated parties in the automobile business and, as reflected by the agreements,\nthat both knew a protest from another dealer was possible and could result in significant delay.\nBut the AESSA placed the obligation to use best efforts to litigate or settle the protest on Chrysler\n(requiring only that Manuel cooperate with Chrysler) and provided that time was of the essence,\nand Manuel's actual damages could be no other than the profits he lost by reason of the delay\ncaused by Chrysler's failure to use its best efforts to litigate or settle the Meador protest. 28\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Reliance on “Planning Potential”\n [25] In November 2001, before the opening of the dealership, Chrysler prepared and Mr. Manuel\nsigned a document introduced into evidence and referred to as a DAP–3, which projected net\nprofits for the first year of operation of the South Arlington dealership based upon the number\nof units Chrysler estimated for anticipated sales during the first year of actual *192 operation.\nChrysler now says that its estimate is “not reliable” and should not have been used by Manuel's\nexperts to project sales. However, Van Gray, Chrysler's own national dealer placement manager\nresponsible for placing, planning, and relocating dealerships, testified that planning potential is\na common methodology prepared and used by automobile manufacturers. In a new “green field\nmarket” such as South Arlington, it was the “best number” available to capitalize and plan a\ndealership. In an established market, he said, planning potential would be similar to minimum sales\nresponsibility. Gray further testified that Chrysler performs extensive market research as to where\ndealerships are to be located and as to what the planning potentials should be. Manuel's experts\naccepted that Chrysler had properly evaluated the market and the resulting anticipated sales based\nupon data researched by its market research company, Urban Sciences. They testified that planning\npotential is consistently used as an industry standard and concluded that it was reasonable to use\nthe planning potential assigned in the AESSA by Chrysler itself as the estimate for sales of new\nvehicles for that year by the dealership. Thus, the experts' reliance on Chrysler's planning potential\ndid not render their opinions unreliable.\n\n\n2. Comparable Dealership\n [26] Chrysler's expert (1) criticized Manuel's experts' use of Manuel's Richardson dealership's\noperation for 2001 as a comparable dealership by which to ascertain the new dealership's\nanticipated net profits for that year, (2) thought that Manuel's experts should have used subsequent\nactual years of operation for the new dealership, and (3) believed that Chrysler's number of units\nof 1076 was “too high” to use as estimated actual sales for that year. Manuel's experts, Vinson and\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                        41\n\fDaimlerChrysler Motors Co., LLC v.

Vinson and Wilkerson testified that they chose a dealership owned and managed\nby Manuel because using other dealerships would inject too many uncertainties and extraneous\nvariables into the comparison. Chrysler's dealer placement manager, Van Gray, agreed that\nmanagement by the dealer-principal is the most important factor in the profitability of a dealership.\n\nAdditionally, Vinson and Wilkerson testified that the Richardson dealership and Manuel's West\nLoop Dodge dealership were the only two of Manuel's dealerships that they could have used for\nthe year in question. They did not use the West Loop Dodge dealership in Fort Worth because\nit sold other lines of vehicles not manufactured by Chrysler, and it would have been extremely\ndifficult to separate out the expenses and revenues attributable to Chrysler vehicles. They did not\nuse Manuel's Lancaster dealership as a basis for comparison because Manuel did not own that\nstore during the relevant time period.\n\nChrysler also criticizes Manuel's experts' choice of using Manuel Dodge as its yardstick because\nthat dealership sold Dodge trucks, and the Dallas–Fort Worth area is the biggest truck market in\nthe world and more likely to be profitable for that reason. But Wilkerson testified that the gross\nprofit per vehicle was within the same range for both dealerships. He tested the damage model by\ncomparing it to gross profit per unit for other area dealers doing business in 2001 and concluded\nthat *193 the model was very conservative. We hold that the experts' reliance on the Richardson\ndealership as the most comparable dealership did not render their opinions unreliable.\n\n\n3. Applicable time period\n [27] Chrysler's argument that Vinson and Wilkerson should have used subsequent years of the\nSouth Arlington dealership's actual operation versus Manuel's damage model based on the 2001\nperiod during which the dealership was delayed in opening was arguably the most contentious\nsubject of the trial as to damages. The dealership opened in February of 2002. However, both\nChrysler's and Manuel's witnesses agreed that the years of 2000 and 2001 were exceptionally great\nyears for Chrysler sales in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, whereas the significant downturn in the\nautomobile market began in 2002, when registrations for Chrysler vehicles declined by 20 percent\nand profit for all dealers fell $8.2 million. The downturn was continuing at the time of trial. The\nSouth Arlington dealership had a loss of $482,000 in 2002. But Manuel's experts testified that\nlooking at actual performance in 2002 would not accurately reflect how the dealership would have\nperformed in 2001. Wilkerson testified that the difference between actual and projected sales was\n$1.1 million.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The “actual damages” of\n$370,668.50 awarded by the trial court were well within the range of Chrysler's own estimate of\nnet profits as well as those of Manuel's witnesses.\n\nMoreover, even if there was an error in admission of the expert testimony, it was harmless.

Chrysler's contention is that the\nfirst time it had notice of any claim against it for damages for breach of the AESSA or Settlement\nAgreement was Manuel's May 31, 2004 demand letter and that the July 16, 2002 written notice\nwas for an entirely different claim on which Manuel did not prevail in the trial court. Therefore,\nChrysler argues that the written notice of that other claim cannot constitute the date from which\nprejudgment interest was to run.\n\nIn the July 16, 2002 letter, Manuel asserted that Chrysler had orally agreed at the June 14, 2000\nstrategy meeting to dismiss its appeal in federal court and attempt to negotiate a settlement with\nMeador while Manuel sued Meador in state court for damages as a result of Meador's protest\nand that the Chrysler representatives present at the meeting “unanimously agreed” to reimburse\nManuel for Manuel's legal fees and expenses.\n\nPursuant to the alleged agreement reached at the meeting, Manuel filed suit against Meador in\nTarrant County District Court on July 12, 2000. Manuel continued the state court suit against\nMeador to a conclusion, claiming breach of contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel, and seeking\ndamages for lost profits, lost income, loss of opportunity, rental and salary. 29 Manuel eventually\nagreed to submit the case against Meador to binding arbitration, pursuant to which a take-nothing\njudgment was rendered against Manuel in June 2002.\n\nTommy Manuel testified that he hand-delivered a brown envelope to the Dallas zone manager\ncontaining his letter demand of July 16, 2002, together with documents consisting of hourly\nbillings by Manuel's attorney and his expert in that case, for reimbursement by Chrysler of his\nattorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with his state court litigation against Meador.\nChrysler denied any such agreement to reimburse Manuel for attorney's fees and expenses in the\nstate court litigation. After a series of discussions *195 and repeated oral demands by Manuel\nto Chrysler representatives, Chrysler notified Manuel by a February 26, 2004 letter that Chrysler\nwould not meet the demand for the attorney's fees and expenses. 30\n\nThe second demand letter of May 21, 2004, which Chrysler contends constitutes the only “written\nnotice” of Manuel's claim against Chrysler, reiterated Manuel's claim that Chrysler had agreed\nto pay his attorney's fees and expenses in prosecuting the suit in state court against Meador. But\nthe second letter also made demand for payment of the damages that Manuel had sustained as the\nresult of the delay in opening the South Arlington dealership, including lost profits.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Kenneco Energy, Inc., in which the supreme\ncourt held that a stand-still agreement tolling the running of limitations for filing of a suit against\nJohnson & Higgins pending resolution of other litigation, rather than a later formal DTPA demand\nletter, was sufficient written notice of a claim against Johnson & Higgins for purposes of accrual\nof prejudgment interest. See 962 S.W.2d at 531. In particular, Manuel cites language of the court\nnoting that at the time of the stand-still agreement, Johnson & Higgins had sufficient information\nto obtain a settlement without incurring any prejudgment interest and that it was not necessary\nthat the document give specific notice to the other party, so long as it demands compensation or\nasserts a right to payment. See id. Manuel argues that the July 16, 2002 letter similarly sufficiently\nasserted his right to payment and points to the documents attached to that letter, which he describes\nas including documentation of other damages, including lost profits, as well as attorney's fee\nstatements and expert witness expenses. He also refers to testimony of a Chrysler representative\nabout possible settlement options with Manuel, including damages of over two million dollars\nbased upon that witness's own review of the July 16, 2002 demand letter.\n\nWe do not find Johnson & Higgins to be analogous to this case for several reasons. First, the\nstandstill agreement and the later DTPA letter in that case involved the same claim against Johnson\n& Higgins, not two separate claims as in this case. Secondly, the other litigation was ongoing at the\ntime the standstill agreement was entered into and arose from the same occurrence, so that Johnson\n& Higgins had ample notice of the nature of the claim. Thirdly, as the supreme court pointed out,\nthe “standstill agreement plainly says that ‘Kenneco asserts that, to the extent underwriters are\nfound not to be liable [in the federal action] ..., J & H is liable to Kenneco for the amounts which\nKenneco has claimed under the Policy.” Through the specific language of the standstill agreement,\nitself, it was clear that Kenneco was asserting a right to be paid for the same amounts claimed\nin the federal suit. Thus, Johnson & Higgins had sufficient information at that time to obtain a\nsettlement without incurring any prejudgment interest at all. See Owens–Illinois, Inc. v. Estate of\nBurt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435379\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435379/owens-illinois-inc-v-estate-of-burt/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769 (Tex.1995) (“[A] defendant must have notice and an opportunity to\nsettle a claim.”).\n\nIn contrast, this case involved two separate claims under two different contracts entered into, if at\nall, at different times and related to different occurrences and suits. We agree with Chrysler that\nthe final judgment used the wrong date from which to calculate prejudgment interest. *196 The\nsubject of the letter of July 16, 2002, used by the court as the start date is not the claim on which\nManuel prevailed, and we can find no mention in that letter or in the accompanying documentation\nthat can be interpreted even to suggest a right to damages against Chrysler upon which this suit\nwas based. Prejudgment interest cannot be based on an unrelated claim arising from a different\nalleged contract (the alleged oral agreement of June 14, 2000), made under entirely different\ncircumstances (the strategy meeting of Chrysler and Manuel and their respective lawyers), and\nwhich was not a part of the contracts that were the basis of this lawsuit.

The date of the\nlater demand letter was less than 180 days before Manuel filed this suit on June 9, 2004. Therefore,\nthe accrual date for purposes of calculating prejudgment interest is June 9, 2004, the date on which\nManuel filed this suit. See Johnson & Higgins, 962 S.W.2d at 532. We sustain Chrysler's fourth\nissue. Calculating an 8.25% rate on $370,668.50 from June 9, 2004 to May 31, 2007 gives a total of\n$90,985.08.

ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\nIn his cross-appeal, Manuel contends in four issues that the trial court erred by failing to award\nhim trial and appellate attorney's fees. Chrysler responds that the trial court did not err because\nMichigan law applies and does not permit recovery of attorney's fees for breach of contract actions,\nbecause the AESSA prohibits recovery of attorney's fees, and because an award of appellate\nattorney's fees is not mandatory.\n\n [32] A party can recover attorney's fees under civil practice and remedies code chapter 38 if\nthe claim is one listed in section 38.001, such as for breach of contract, and if the party (1) is\nrepresented by an attorney, (2) presented his or her claim to the opposing party or that party's duly\nauthorized agent, and (3) the opposing party did not tender the just amount owed within thirty\ndays. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. §§ 38.001, .002 (West 2008). If all of the statutory\nelements are established and there is proof of the reasonableness of the fees, an award of fees\nunder section 38.001 is mandatory. See AMX Enters., L.L.P. v. Master Realty Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1860154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1860154/amx-enterprises-llp-v-master-realty-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2009, no pet.).\n\n\nA. Trial Attorney's Fees\n [33] Chrysler does not dispute whether Manuel established each of the statutory elements but\ninstead contends that Manuel may not recover attorney's fees for other legal reasons. First, Chrysler\nargues that Michigan law applies and that Michigan law does not permit the recovery of attorney's\nfees in breach of contract actions. However, Chrysler did not file a motion or otherwise request that\nthe trial court take judicial notice of Michigan law until after the trial. While we do not hold that a\nmotion seeking judicial notice of the law of another state will always be untimely if filed after trial,\nChrysler's posttrial motion was untimely in this case. Choice-of-law matters may be waived, and\nwe hold that Chrysler waived its choice-of-law complaint in this case by failing to raise the matter\nbefore trial, by failing to object to the admission of evidence at trial concerning Manuel's attorney's\nfees, and by cross-examining Manuel's attorney about the segregation of attorney's fees, all of\nwhich are inconsistent with Chrysler's appellate *197 contention that Michigan law prevents the\nrecovery of attorney's fees in this case. 31 See Gen.

Therefore, we hold that the AESSA does not prohibit the recovery of\nManuel's attorney's fees.\n\n [35] Chrysler next argues that the trial court properly denied Manuel's request for attorney's fees\nbecause Manuel failed to segregate his attorney's fees between those incurred prosecuting claims\nfor which attorney's fees are recoverable and those incurred prosecuting claims for which attorney's\nfees are not recoverable. To support its contention, Chrysler relies on Green Int'l, Inc., 951 S.W.2d\nat 389, in which the supreme court stated: “A failure to segregate attorney's fees in a case containing\nmultiple causes of action, only some of which entitle the recovery of attorney's fees, can result\nin the recovery of zero attorney's fees.” However, this statement from Green Int'l, Inc. has been\ncharacterized as dicta and is inconsistent with a subsequent supreme court opinion which holds\nthat the failure to segregate attorney's fees does not bar all recovery of attorney's fees.

The Anderson court, although it\nstated the general rule, held earlier in the opinion that the fee claimant could not prevail on its\ncontract claim, meaning there was no basis for the recovery of any attorney's fees. See 44 S.W.3d\nat 221; cf.

It also argues that the declaratory judgment against it was unwarranted. We\nagree and accordingly reverse and render judgment for Etan.\n\nEtan, a cable television and internet provider, had cable lines running on two properties owned\nby Ronald and Dana Lehmann (the Lehmanns). The properties were located on Highways 77\nand 290. Etan's cable lines were placed on poles belonging to Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative,\nInc., an electricity provider. Bluebonnet had easements on the Lehmann properties allowing it to\nplace and operate “an electric transmission or distribution line or system” on the properties. Etan\nand Bluebonnet 1 had written agreements known as joint use or pole attachment agreements. The\nagreements allowed Etan to make use of Bluebonnet's poles, but only “to the extent [Bluebonnet]\nmay lawfully do so,” and stated that Etan was responsible for obtaining its own easements and\nrights-of-way from property owners.\n\nThe Lehmanns purchased the Highway 77 property in 1986. At the time, Bluebonnet had lines\nrunning within an easement on this property. In December 2000, Etan hung a cable on Bluebonnet's\npoles. Ronald's brother Steven also owned property along Highway 77. Steven immediately\nnoticed Etan's cable on his own property and on Ronald's property, and notified Ronald. Steven\nthereafter had several conversations with employees of Bluebonnet and Etan, described below.\nSteven testified that he would always “fully apprise” Ronald of the conversations. Ronald likewise\nconfirmed that Steven “told me everything” about the conversations.\n\nRonald and Steven decided Steven would call Bluebonnet about the new line. The day after\nnoticing the line, Steven called Bluebonnet and was told the line belonged to Etan. Steven called\nEtan and spoke to Etan employee Jerry Smith. Smith told Steven that Etan had an easement and that\nSmith would send a copy of it to Steven. Steven waited for “a while” and called Smith back. Smith\ntold Steven he was having trouble locating the easement but would find it and send it. In Summer\n2001, Steven called Smith again. This time, Smith told Steven that Smith had been mistaken and\nEtan did not have an easement on the Highway 77 property. Smith claimed however that Etan had\nan oral agreement with Bluebonnet allowing Etan to use Bluebonnet's easements. According to\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Based on this representation, “[w]e just dropped it.”\n\nIn December 2002, Ronald read a newspaper article about Marcus Cable Associates, L.P. v.\nKrohn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494134\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494134/marcus-cable-associates-lp-v-krohn/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.2002). In that case, we held that an easement permitting an electric\ncooperative to construct and maintain “an electric transmission *622 or distribution line or\nsystem” did not allow a cable television provider under a joint use agreement to place cable\ntelevision lines in the easement. Id. at 699, 706–07. The Lehmann brothers both testified that\nthey understood the case to hold a cable company could not hang a communication line in an\nelectrical transmission easement. According to Steven, the Krohn decision “just threw up a red\nflag and I went to investigate it some more.” The brothers decided to contact Bluebonnet. In\nDecember 2002, Steven spoke to a Bluebonnet representative, who informed Steven that Etan\ncould use the Bluebonnet poles under the pole attachment agreements but that Etan was required\nto obtain its own easements from property owners. Bluebonnet informed Steven that without a\nseparate easement Etan was trespassing. Steven understood Bluebonnet's position—that Etan was\nrequired to obtain its own easements—to contradict Smith's earlier representation that Etan did not\nneed a separate easement. Ronald, likewise, understood that “[w]e had two conflicting stories.”\nBluebonnet told Steven that it would contact Etan “and try to get this thing worked out,” but Steven\nand Ronald did not hear back from Etan or Bluebonnet. Also during this time period, Ronald went\nto the courthouse to look for property records of easements. Ronald was not a lawyer but had some\nexperience conducting real estate transactions and reviewing real property records. He was unable\nto locate any Etan easements on his properties.\n\nSteven and Ronald eventually decided to contact a lawyer in mid to late 2003. The lawyer contacted\nBluebonnet and requested documentation regarding the easements on his clients' properties.\nBluebonnet informed the lawyer that locating the documents would take some time. In July 2004,\nthe lawyer received documents from Bluebonnet. No Etan easement was produced. The documents\nincluded Bluebonnet easements on the properties, and also included pole attachment agreements\nstating that “[e]ach party shall be responsible for obtaining its own easements and rights-of-way.”\nIn or about August 2004, Ronald and Steven met with their lawyer and reviewed the documents.\n\nSteven filed suit against Etan for trespass in December 2004. Steven's case settled in September\n2005. In October 2005, Ronald and Dana Lehmann filed suit pertaining to the Highway 290\nproperty. In April 2006, the Lehmanns added claims pertaining to their Highway 77 property.\nRonald testified that he waited to sue on the Highway 77 property because Steven had sued on his\nHighway 77 property, and Ronald decided to “watch and see” what happened in Steven's suit.\n\nThe jury rejected trespass and other tort claims pertaining to the Highway 290 property, and found\nthat Etan had obtained a prescriptive easement on this property.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court awarded\na declaratory judgment stating that neither Bluebonnet's easements nor Etan's pole attachment\nagreements with Bluebonnet provided Etan with easements or other rights-of-way on the\nLehmanns' properties.\n\nEtan argues that the claims for declaratory judgment were moot because Etan had removed its\nlines from the Lehmanns' properties prior to trial.

The declaratory judgment\nclaim must do more “than merely duplicate the issues litigated” via the contract or tort claims. Id.\n\nBy these standards the declaratory judgment and attorney's fees awarded thereunder were not\nwarranted. The declaratory judgment simply duplicated the issues litigated under the trespass claim\nby declaring, consistent with the Lehmanns' theory of trespass, that neither Bluebonnet's easements\nnor the pole attachment agreements between Bluebonnet and Etan gave Etan the right to place its\nlines on the Lehmanns' properties.

The trial court and the\ncourt of appeals agreed with the lessee's interpretation, but we agree with the lessor's. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the court of appeals' judgment, render judgment in part for the lessor, and remand the\ncase to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\nFrost National Bank purchased fourteen new delivery vehicles and leased them to Williams\nDistributors, Inc., a beer distributor. Frost and Williams entered into a sixty-month equipment\nlease agreement. 1 The lease's purchase option provision, known as a terminal rental adjustment\nclause, or TRAC, gave the lessee (Williams) the right to purchase the vehicles by giving the lessor\n(Frost) ninety days' written notice and provided for payment to be made “on the last day of [the\nlease's] Expiration [in] an amount in cash equal to the then Fair Market Value as hereafter defined\nin this section, of such Equipment.” The agreement then clarified that the lessor would collect an\namount equal to twenty percent of the original invoice price of the vehicles when they were sold,\nwhether to the lessee or to a third party; specifically, if the vehicles were sold to a third party, the\nlessor would pay the lessee any proceeds in excess of that amount, and, should the lessor receive\nless than the twenty percent from the sale, the lessee would owe the difference as a final rental\npayment.\n\nJust over a year into the lease term, Williams assigned the lease, with Frost's consent, to L & F\nDistributors, Inc., another beer distributor. Shortly thereafter, L & F notified Frost of its intent to\nexercise the purchase option. Before Frost responded, L & F sued Frost for a declaratory judgment,\nand L & F later amended its petition to add a claim for specific performance. L & F also sent Frost\na letter with a payment of $169,874.99, which amounted to twenty percent of the original invoice\nprice of the vehicles. Frost rejected and returned L & F's payment, refusing to sell the vehicles\nuntil the last day of the lease term, and also counterclaimed for declaratory relief and breach of\ncontract when L & F stopped paying rent on the vehicles. The parties agreed to narrow the scope\nof the dispute to the declaratory judgment requests and to limit Frost's claim for damages. Both\nparties filed motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe trial court partially granted L & F's motion for summary judgment and denied Frost's motion,\ndeclaring that Frost breached the lease agreement by refusing to sell the vehicles when L & F\ntendered payment. The trial court also awarded L & F its attorney's fees. The court of appeals\naffirmed, holding that the lease agreement was unambiguous and allowed L & F, as lessee, to\npurchase the vehicles with proper notice at any time on or before the end of the term. 2 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1881385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1881385/frost-nat-bank-v-l-f-distributors-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 933.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In construing a contract, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties'\n *312 intentions as expressed in the document.

Specifically, the court of appeals noted that the\nfirst sentence allows L & F to buy the vehicles either on or before the expiration of the lease, the\nonly qualifications being that L & F cannot be in default, must buy all the vehicles, and must give\nFrost at least ninety days' notice of the purchase. Id. The court of appeals then held that the second\nsentence, which requires payment to be made “on the last day of such Expiration,” does not create\nan ambiguity or call for payment only at the end of the sixty-month lease term. Id.\n\nWere we to consider the purchase option provision in isolation, we might agree with the court\nof appeals' reading. However, when both sentences of the provision are properly considered in\nconjunction with each other and the rest of the agreement, particularly the contractual definition of\n *313 the term “Expiration,” the agreement unambiguously allows L & F to purchase the vehicles\nonly at the end of the sixty-month lease term. 3\n\nThe court of appeals ignored pertinent language in the lease schedule when it held that, should L\n& F choose to exercise the purchase option before the end of sixty months, the lease would simply\nexpire and payment would be due at the time of purchase. Id. The agreement specifically states that\nthe lease ends on the “Expiration” or “Expiration Date,” which occurs at sixty months. A different\ncontractual term, “Termination,” describes the agreement's being terminated on an earlier or later\ndate. By calling for payment “on the last day of such Expiration [of] an amount in cash equal to\nthe then Fair Market Value,” the agreement provides that, should L & F give the requisite notice\nof its intent to exercise the purchase option, it will pay Frost at the end of the sixty-month lease\nterm the then-fair market value of the vehicles, which will effectively come out to twenty percent\nof the invoice price. To reach the court of appeals' conclusion requires either substituting the\nword “Termination” for “Expiration” in the purchase option provision or amending the contractual\ndefinition of “Expiration,” neither of which is appropriate in construing an agreement.\n\nIn addition, L & F's and the court of appeals' construction is “unreasonable, inequitable, and\noppressive.” Reilly, 727 S.W.2d at 530. Such a construction allows the lessee to terminate the\nlease and purchase the vehicles for the same price (twenty percent of the original invoice price)\nat any point during the five-year lease term with the requisite notice. At the lessee's discretion,\nthen, the lessor would essentially have to forgo almost the entire rental value of the equipment and\nsell it almost new for twenty percent of its value, the same price it would receive for selling the\nequipment at the end of the lease term after collecting rent on it for sixty months. Bearing in mind\nthat our primary goal is to ascertain the intent of the parties when they entered into the agreement,\nwe find such a construction unreasonable. Because there is only one reasonable interpretation of\nthe lease, we construe it as a matter of law.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Michael Lillis is one of those producers, and he has sold gas from his\nwells to Kachina since at least 2001. In 2003, Kachina installed the Barker Central Compression\nStation on its pipeline. That compression allows Kachina to resell to Davis at its high-pressure\ninlet, for which Davis pays a higher per-volume price. Kachina installed additional compression\nin 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Kachina and Lillis entered into a new Gas Purchase Agreement naming Kachina as\n“Buyer” and Lillis as “Seller.” Under the Agreement, Lillis would transfer gas from his wells into\nKachina's gathering system at specified delivery points and Kachina would pay Lillis a percentage\nof the proceeds it obtained through resale to Davis. A producer can successfully deliver gas\nonly if its pressure is sufficient to overcome the working pressure in the gathering system, and\nthe Agreement addresses the parties' rights and responsibilities as to pressure. It specifies that\n“neither party hereto shall be obligated to compress any gas” but provides that “[i]f Buyer installs\ncompression to effect delivery of Seller's gas, Buyer will deduct from proceeds payable to Seller\nhereunder a value equal to Buyer's actual costs to install, repair, maintain and operate compression\nplus 20% of such costs to cover management, overhead and administration.”\n\nThe Agreement provides it is effective for an “initial period” expiring May 2010, at which point\nit continues month-to-month and is cancelable by either party upon thirty days' notice. “Upon\ntermination or cancellation of [the] Agreement, prior to Seller selling gas to a third party,” Kachina\nhas the option to “continue the purchase of gas under the terms of [the] Agreement with such\nadjustments in the price hereunder as may be required to yield the same economic benefit to Seller,\nas would be derived from the proposed third[-]party offer.”\n\nKachina bought, transported, and resold Lillis's gas according to the Agreement. It deducted from\nLillis's share of the proceeds “marketing fees,” which included his pro rata share of compression\ncosts. In 2008, Lillis entered into a purchase agreement directly with Davis and constructed his\nown pipeline to its plant. Around the same time, he objected to the compression fees Kachina had\nbeen deducting.\n\n *2 Lillis then sued, asserting that the Agreement did not authorize deduction for compression\noccurring after he delivered the gas to Kachina and that Kachina thus breached the Agreement\nby deducting those compression fees. He sought a declaration that Kachina was in breach and an\naccounting. He also brought a fraud claim, asserting that Kachina represented it would release him\nfrom the Agreement and that he built the new pipeline in reliance on that representation. Kachina\ncounterclaimed, asserting Lillis breached the Agreement by failing to notify it of Davis's third-\nparty offer.

Kachina's\ndeductions included Lillis's share of total system compressor costs, based on the proportion of\ngas moved through the system that originated from his wells. The Barker station was in place and\noperating at the time the parties entered into the Agreement. In 2007, Kachina added compression\nequipment to “enhance operations and move more gas through the system for delivery to Davis,”\naccording to Kachina's president.\n\n *3 Kachina argues the provision authorizes deductions for any compression that aids in the final\ndelivery to Davis of gas bought from Lillis. Under this interpretation, Kachina rightfully deducted\nLillis's share of the costs of all compression. Lillis, on the other hand, argues the provision's plain\nlanguage allows deductions only for compression that Kachina installs if Lillis fails to deliver\nat pressures that overcome Kachina's working pressure at the point of transfer. He thus argues\nKachina must show (1) Lillis has become unable to deliver against Kachina's working pressure, and\n(2) the compression equipment was installed after the Agreement's execution. This interpretation\nwould preclude deduction for the pre-existing compression at the Barker station. And though the\ncompression added in 2007 would satisfy Lillis's second requirement, Kachina does not argue and\nthe record does not support it was installed because one of Lillis's wells failed to deliver.\n\n“In construing a contract, a court must ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the\nwriting itself.” Italian Cowboy, 341 S.W.3d at 333.

A paragraph titled “Delivery\nPoint” defines the point of transfer:\n\n   Seller agrees to deliver and Buyer agrees to receive the gas deliverable hereunder at the outlet of\n   Buyer['s] ... metering facilities to be located at a mutually agreeable point(s) at or near Seller's\n   well(s). Such point shall constitute the delivery point for all gas to be delivered hereunder.\n\nThe next paragraph provides, “Title of all gas delivered hereunder shall pass to Buyer at the\ndelivery point.” A paragraph titled “Pressure” generally addresses the pressure differential at that\npoint:\n\n   Pressure: Seller shall deliver the gas deliverable hereunder, at the above [-]described delivery\n   point at a pressure sufficient to enter Buyer's pipeline against the working pressure maintained\n   therein from time to time. Seller will regulate its[ ] pressures so as to not exceed the maximum\n   allowed operating pressure (MAOP) as set from time to time by Buyer for deliveries into\n   Buyer's gas pipeline. However, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither party hereto\n   shall be obligated to compress any gas under the terms of this Agreement and if the well is\n   no longer capable of delivering gas against the working pressures maintained at the delivery\n   point and neither party elects to install a compressor, then Buyer shall, upon request from\n   Seller, release such well and the gas produced therefrom from the terms and provisions of this\n   Agreement. If Buyer installs compression to effect delivery of Seller's gas, Buyer will deduct\n   from proceeds payable to Seller hereunder a value equal to Buyer's actual costs to install,\n   repair, maintain and operate compression, plus 20% of such costs to cover management,\n   overhead and administration.\n\n*4 (emphasis added).\n\nThe Pressure paragraph recognizes transfer into Kachina's line depends on the producer's well's\npressure being sufficient to overcome Kachina's working pressure, and it imposes the duty to\nmaintain sufficient pressure on the producer. If a well fails to overcome Kachina's working\npressure, the paragraph gives Kachina two options. It may do nothing, in which case the well\nwill be released from the Agreement. Or it may elect to install compression so that the well can\novercome the working pressure. If Kachina elects the latter, it has the right to deduct costs incurred.\n\nThe contingent nature of that right is unavoidable—it arises only “[i]f [Kachina] installs\ncompression to effect delivery.” See Solar Applications Eng'g, Inc. v.

We\nmust reach two conclusions to make sense of this contingent phrasing. First, it does not apply\nto preexisting compression. It makes little sense that the parties would have made deductions\ncontingent on installation if they intended the provision to also cover the compression already\nin place at the time of the Agreement. Second, only compression installed for the purpose of\novercoming Kachina's working pressure is installed to “effect delivery.” The sentence immediately\npreceding the compression-cost provision contemplates a scenario in which “a well is no longer\ncapable of delivering gas against the working pressures” and “neither party elects to install a\ncompressor.” Generally, well pressure tends to diminish over time as the reservoir is depleted;\nthe Pressure paragraph creates an elective scheme that addresses this reality. Indeed, the ordinary\nmeaning of the verb “effect” is “to bring about; to make happen.” BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY\n628 (10th ed.2014). If a well's natural pressure is sufficient to overcome the working pressure at\nthe delivery point, added compression can hardly be said to bring about delivery that would occur\nwithout it. To construe the compression-cost provision to apply to any compression would ignore\nits plainly contingent language and the elective scheme it creates.\n\nKachina argues that “delivery” includes final delivery to a third party—here, Davis—because\nthe provision does not expressly limit “delivery” to mean only transfer into its system. When\nconsidering the Agreement as a whole and the specific context in which the provision appears,\nthis cannot be so. The Agreement does not define the term “delivery,” but it uses “deliver”\nor “delivery” dozens of times throughout, almost exclusively to refer to transfer from Lillis to\nKachina. And, as discussed, the Pressure paragraph containing the compression-cost provision\nspecifically addresses pressure issues at those points of transfer.\n\n *5 In contrast, the Agreement refers to re-delivery to a third party only twice. Once is in\na paragraph titled “Reservation of Gas by Buyer,” which allows Kachina to except from the\nAgreement gas to operate compression that is “required to provide gas to third[-]party purchasers.”\nThus, the Agreement contemplates Kachina may need to compress the gas for resale, but it uses\nthe term “provide” rather than “deliver.” And though Kachina may use gathered gas to fuel that\ncompression, the provision is silent as to who bears the compression's cost. The other usage is in\nthe price provision, which sets the price based on the net volume “delivered to and resold by the\nBuyer based on the price received by the Buyer for resale of same said gas delivered at the outlet of\nthe Buyer's System.” That single usage of “delivery” to refer to transfer to a third-party purchaser\nat the outlet of Kachina's system cannot outweigh the consistency with which it is otherwise used\nthroughout the Agreement and in the compression provision's specific textual environment.\n\nKachina's fall-back position is that even if “delivery” means transfer at the delivery point and\nnot to the Davis plant, the Barker compressor “effects delivery” by creating a suction, thereby\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The CHIEF JUSTICE agrees. While we do not question that downstream\ncompression may function as Kachina suggests, that factual assertion does not help interpret the\nAgreement's language. Both Kachina and the CHIEF JUSTICE assume any compression that aids\nin delivery “effects delivery.” But, respectfully, neither offers an alternative interpretation of the\ncontract language that would harmonize this position with the provision's contingent phrasing\nand immediate context. See FPL Energy, LLC v. TXU Portfolio Mgmt.

We disagree. Compression is clearly necessary for re-delivery to\nDavis's high-pressure intake, but the record shows Davis can also take low-pressure sales at less\nthan 50 pounds per square inch gauge. Lillis delivers to Kachina at 50 and 80 pounds per square\ninch gauge, and the record establishes gas could flow from the leases through Kachina's line and\nto Davis without compression if Kachina had not opted for the high-pressure sale. In any case, the\nsummary-judgment burden is Kachina's, and Lillis need not establish the compression here was\nnot necessary for delivery to Kachina.\n\nThe Pressure paragraph acknowledges Kachina's options if faced with an underpressurized well\nand shifts costs of compression installed to remedy such a situation. But there is no evidence in\nthe record presented that Kachina ever faced an underpressurization issue. The record supports\nonly that Kachina constructed the Barker compression station to take advantage of the higher price\nDavis pays for high-pressure resales and added the 2007 compression to increase the amount of\ngas gathered and transported. The Agreement does not address these decisions.\n\nWe do not mean to say, however, that the compression's location is determinative. The court\nof appeals held that “the provision does not expressly speak to whether Kachina may seek\nrecovery for compression that occurs after gas has been transferred.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3186261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8.\nWe disagree with the court's implicit assumption that compression occurring on Kachina's side\nof the delivery point cannot “effect delivery.” As Kachina and two pipeline-industry amici point\nout, compression not only increases downstream pressure, it reduces upstream pressure, which\ncan decrease the working pressure at the delivery points to facilitate transfer from a low-pressure\nwell.

The provision allows deductions only for compression that\nserves that purpose, but it does not speak to the compression's location. In fact, the Agreement\nprovides Lillis has “exclusive control and possession of the gas deliverable hereunder” until title\ntransfers at the delivery point, and it gives Kachina no right to install any equipment upstream from\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals' implied limitation would effectively require the parties to\nact beyond the rights the Agreement affords in order to give the provision effect.\n\n *6 The record reflects that Kachina had been deducting compression costs as part of its marketing\nfees since at least 2003 under the 2001 contract. Kachina points to Lillis's acquiescence to\nthose fees as evidence that he knew he would share those costs. The 2001 compression-cost\nprovision was written more broadly than its counterpart in the 2005 Agreement, however, and\nsuch acquiescence does not establish a course of dealing that supports Kachina's interpretation.\nSeeTEX. BUS. & COM. CODEE §§ 1.303(b), 2.202(1) (defining course of dealing and allowing\ncourse of dealing to explain express terms). The 2001 contract allows deduction of a compression\nfee “[s]hould Seller at any Point of Delivery deliver gas into one of Buyer's pipelines whereon\ncompression facilities are installed.” That provision would certainly apply to all compression here.\nThat the provision's language changed so drastically between the 2001 and 2005 contracts supports\nour interpretation of the Agreement's language. The CHIEF JUSTICE argues it makes no sense\nthat Lillis would cease to assume his share of costs. But our task is to interpret the Agreement's\nlanguage, not to justify the bargain it memorializes.

But the option right granted is not the right to a new or renewed\nagreement; it is the right to continue the purchase of gas under the Agreement's terms. The five-\nyear initial period is one of those terms. Another is that the Agreement would become month-to-\nmonth in May 2010. The express language does not subject the parties to a new agreement with\na new initial term.\n\n *7 Kachina points to the proposed agreement between Lillis and Davis, which it says also sets\na fixed price for a five-year term. The provision, however, allows adjustments only in price\nbased on the outside third-party agreement. It does not import any other term from a third-party\noffer. Kachina's rights are confined to the Agreement regardless of the content of the Lillis–Davis\nagreement, price notwithstanding.\n\nKachina argues that because the market price of gas fluctuates, a new five-year term is required\nto confer the same economic benefit on Lillis as he would have received through his deal with\nDavis. While it may be true that generally a contract's economic value is to some extent a function\nof its term period and that our interpretation should be informed by that commercial context,\nthe plain language here still does not entitle Kachina to an additional five-year term. Further,\nthe provision protects Lillis by ensuring he receives the economic benefit of any outside deal he\nprocures after rightfully cancelling or terminating the contract. It does not confer any additional\nrights on Kachina, and to construe it as forcing Lillis into an extended commitment runs contrary\nto its purpose.\n\nFinally, Kachina argues our construction yields the absurd result that Lillis may cancel the\nAgreement every month, requiring Kachina to perpetually exercise its option. The reality,\nhowever, is not so absurd. While Lillis is entitled to cancel on the first day of any month once\nthe initial term expired, his only reason to do so would be that a third party had offered a\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The provision recognizes that Lillis may pursue a better deal, and it indeed requires\nKachina to match that deal if it is to continue purchasing from Lillis. Kachina, however, insists the\nbusiness of natural-gas transportation requires substantial upfront investment in equipment and\nmaintenance and therefore is not suited to such an unpredictable short-term arrangement. Those\ngeneral concerns are not implicated here where Kachina's upfront investment has already taken\nplace. Kachina has had the initial five-year commitment to secure a return on that investment, and\nit could have specifically contracted for a longer fixed term if the economics required. The option\nprovision does not render the month-to-month term any more at odds with industry realities than\nit is on its own.\n\nThe trial court's declaration that Kachina extended the term of the Agreement to May 31, 2015, is\ninconsistent with the Agreement's express language, and the court of appeals correctly reversed it.\n\n\n\n                                                            III\n\nBecause the court of appeals correctly reversed the trial court's declarations, its reversal of the\nattorney's-fees award and remand to the trial court on the issue were proper. Kachina argues that\nbecause it prevailed on several issues and because some of the declarations concerning the contract\nissues remain intact, reversal of the entire fee award is error. Under the Uniform Declaratory\nJudgments Act, a trial court has discretion to award costs and attorney's fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM. CODEE § 37.009.

(“[A]fter a\ndeclaratory judgment is reversed on appeal, an award of attorneys' fees may no longer be equitable\nand just.”). Kachina may be correct that there remain grounds on which a trial court may award\nfees. But because we decide Kachina did not prevail on two of the primary issues in dispute, we\nremand the issue to determine the appropriate award of costs and fees.\n\n *8 Kachina also asserts that Lillis inadequately briefed the attorney's-fees issue at the court of\nappeals and thus waived the issue. There, Lillis requested remand of the issue of fees and costs “if\nthe Court sustains one or more of its declaratory-judgment challenges.” “[W]e liberally construe\nissues presented to obtain a just, fair, and equitable adjudication of the rights of the litigants.” El\nPaso Natural Gas Co. v.

Jarndyce, 1 there have been charges that some cases benefit the lawyers more\nthan the clients. But suits cannot be maintained solely for the attorney's fees; a client must gain\nsomething before attorney's fees can be awarded. While making losing parties bear their own\nattorney's fees may add injury to insult, the American Rule has long been that each party pays\nits own lawyers.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff obtained a judgment for $1,000 in damages and almost $150,000 in\nattorney's fees. But there was no evidence to support the amount of the $1,000 award, and it is too\nlarge to constitute nominal damages. As the award to the client must be set aside, the attorney's\nfee award must also. Accordingly, we reverse and render a take-nothing judgment.\n\n\n\n                                               I. Background\n\nThe Woodlands Operating Company leased the 19 copiers at issue here from MBM Financial\nCorporation 2 and installed them in late 2000 and early 2001. Each machine was covered by a\nseparate four-year lease, with annual renewals thereafter unless notice was sent between 90 and\n180 days before the end of the existing term. The leases required the Woodlands to return the\ncopiers to a location MBM specified.\n\nThe Woodlands decided not to renew the leases in mid–2004 and asked MBM for the end-of-\nterm dates and instructions for return. MBM employees provided the dates and approved a draft\ntermination letter from the Woodlands. But when the actual termination letter arrived (viewing\nthe evidence in the light favorable to the trial court's judgment), 3 MBM's president unilaterally\nchanged the dates so the notice would be untimely and demanded rent for another year. To bolster\nMBM's position, he signed the leases and inserted commencement dates for the first time after\nthe Woodlands filed suit. Until suit was filed, MBM also refused to designate a return location\nfor the bulky equipment.\n\nThe Woodlands sued, asserting claims for breach of contract, fraud, and declaratory relief. MBM\ncounterclaimed for additional rent of $160,000, though it later dropped that claim. After a two-\nday bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment awarding the Woodlands $1,000 in damages and\n$145,091.59 in attorney's fees through trial. The court of appeals affirmed the damages and part\nof the fee award. 4 On appeal, MBM challenges both.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Nominal Damages & Breach of Contract\n\n [1] At trial, the Woodlands requested only nominal damages. The judgment describes the $1,000\naward as “actual damages,” but the trial court's findings and conclusions describe them as “actual\ndamages in the form of nominal damages.” *664 We agree with MBM that no evidence supports\n$1,000 as either.\n\nThe only damages mentioned at trial related to wasted time the Woodlands spent trying to get\nMBM's cooperation. But there was no evidence about the value of that time—either the quantity\nor the cost of it. The Woodlands blamed this gap on the difficulty of tracking the lost time, but\nnever explained why it could not have been estimated. If the difficulty of proof always discharged\nthe burden of proof, many litigants would simply not bother. 5 While the Woodlands could have\nestimated the value of wasted time, it could not ask the trial court to pull a figure from thin air.\n\n [2] [3] Nevertheless, the Woodlands argues the award was justified as nominal damages. We\nagree nominal damages are available for breach of contract, as this Court has stated at least a dozen\ntimes. 6 As we wrote in 1853:\n\n\n   The law is, that if the contract is proven to be broken, the law would give some damage,\n   sufficient to authorize a verdict for the plaintiff, although, in the absence of proof of special\n loss, the damages would be nominal only. 7\nWe are hardly alone in recognizing nominal damages for breach of contract; so do the First\nand Second Restatements, 8 Williston, 9 Corbin, 10 and Black's Law Dictionary. 11 While more\ngenerous damage measures make nominal damages rare, and some judges have questioned the\nreason behind them, 12 we agree that nominal *665 damages may be recovered for breach of\ncontract.\n\n[4]     [5]    But $1,000 is not nominal damages. “[T]he usual meaning of the phrase ‘nominal\ndamages' refers to an award of one dollar.” 13 Despite substantial changes over the centuries in\nwhat a dollar will buy, it remains the standard award in federal cases, 14 and in Texas cases\nas well. 15 A few cases have awarded nominal damages of $10 and even $100, 16 but nominal\ndamages are supposed to be a “trifling sum,” 17 and $1,000 hardly falls in that category. 18\n\n [6] [7] [8] It appears from the record that the trial court awarded $1,000 as rough compensation\nfor the wasted time the Woodlands incurred. But nominal damages are not for compensation; they\nare for cases in which there are no damages, or none that could ever be proved. 19 While a few older\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Low, we rejected\nnominal damages because actual damages had been incurred, yet the plaintiff failed to prove the\namount. 22 “While mathematical precision is not required to establish the extent or amount of\none's damages, one must bring forward the best evidence of the damage of which the situation\nadmits....” 23 On this record, the $1,000 damage award to the Woodlands cannot be sustained as\neither actual or nominal damages.\n\n[9] While we normally remand for a new trial when there is some evidence to support an amount\nof actual damages, 24 in this case there was no evidence about the amount of damages at all. And\n“where the record shows as a matter of law that the plaintiff is entitled only to nominal damages, the\nappellate court will not reverse merely to enable him to recover such damages.” 25 Accordingly,\nwe must render judgment that the Woodlands take nothing as damages on its breach of contract\nclaim.\n\n\n\n                               III. Attorney's Fees: Breach of Contract\n\n[10] Chapter 38 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code allows recovery of attorney's fees in\nbreach of contract cases: “A person may recover reasonable attorney's fees ... in addition to the\namount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for ... an oral or written contract.” 26 To recover\nfees under this statute, a litigant must do two things: (1) prevail on a breach of contract claim,\nand (2) recover damages. 27 The second requirement is implied from the statute's language: for a\nfee recovery to be “in addition to the amount of a valid claim,” the claimant must recover some\namount on that claim.\n\n [11] While some damages are necessary to recover fees under this statute, 28 this Court has never\nsaid whether nominal damages are enough. But as the Woodlands can recover neither actual nor\nnominal damages, that question is not before us. Accordingly, the Woodlands' fee award cannot\nbe affirmed based on Chapter 38.\n\n\n\n                    IV. Attorney's Fees: Fraud Arising From Breach of Contract\n\n [12] Alternatively, the Woodlands argues it is entitled to attorney's fees based on fraud arising\nfrom a breach of contract, pointing to this Court's reference to such an award in Gill Savings Ass'n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Chair *667 King. 29 But in Gill we merely reinstated bankruptcy and appellate fees; we did\nnot address the court of appeals' award of fees for both contract and fraud on the basis that they\nwere inextricably intertwined. 30 We explicitly rejected this intertwining exception in Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa and reiterated that fees are not allowed for torts like fraud. 31 Thus, even\nif the Woodlands' fraud claim arose from a breach of contract, that is no basis for an attorney's\nfee award.\n\n\n\n                           V. Attorney's Fees: Bad Faith & Vexatious Conduct\n\n[13] [14] The Woodlands also argues it is entitled to attorney's fees because MBM “has acted in\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” The rules of civil procedure allow fees\nas a sanction against a party who files pleadings in bad faith 32 or abuses the discovery process. 33\nBut the Woodlands filed no motion for sanctions pursuant to those rules. Its fee claim was not\nbased on MBM's litigation conduct but on its pre-litigation conduct; such fees are recoverable\nonly if a contract or statute so provides. As the Woodlands cannot recover fees based on contract or\nfraud, allegations that the breach was in bad faith or the fraud vexatious do not change that result.\n\n\n\n                 VI. Attorney's Fees: Declaratory Judgment & Breach of Contract\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed part of the attorney's fee award based on the Declaratory Judgments\nAct. 34 MBM asserts four reasons why declaratory relief was improper and cannot support a fee\naward. We disagree that declaratory relief was improper but agree it cannot support the fee award\nhere.\n\n[15] [16] First, MBM argues that declaratory relief is not available for contract claims (like those\nhere) that are “fully matured and predicated upon a terminated relationship.” But the Act says relief\nis available in contract cases “before or after there has been a breach,” 35 so a matured breach is\nexplicitly covered by the Act. 36 Further, declaratory relief is often available after a relationship has\nbeen terminated, as in cases concerning noncompetition covenants signed by former employees, 37\nor offsetting judgments between former litigants. 38 MBM notes that we justified declaratory relief\nin *668 BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard by referring to an “ongoing and continuing relationship,”\nbut that was solely to show that the defendant's counterclaim (relating to the parties' future rights)\nwent beyond the plaintiff's claim (relating to past damages alone). 39 We disagree that a party can\nimmunize itself against declaratory relief by simply terminating any ongoing relationship.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Sup. Ct. J.</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n [17] Second, MBM urges that declarations of non-liability should be barred in contract cases,\njust as they are in tort cases. As we said in Abor v. Black:\n\n             Because [the Act] appears to give the courts jurisdiction over declarations of\n             non-liability of a potential defendant in a tort action, we find that the ... District\n             Court had jurisdiction over the suit. However, we hold that the trial court should\n             have declined to exercise such jurisdiction because it deprived the real plaintiff\n             of the traditional right to choose the time and place of suit. 40\n\nBut the “real plaintiff” and the “traditional right to choose the time and place of suit” are materially\ndifferent in contract and tort cases. The “real” plaintiff in a tort action is the injured party, yet both\nparties often suffer injury if a contract collapses. When each party claims the other breached (as\nis usually the case), 41 it is hard to say who ought to be the “real” plaintiff. Here, for example,\nwhy should MBM get to choose the time and place of suit rather than the Woodlands? The Act\nitself specifically contemplates declarations that are negative (non-liability) as well as affirmative\n(liability). 42 And historically, declarations of non-liability under a contract have been among the\nmost common suits filed under the Act, including:\n\n\n   • suits by insurers to declare non-liability under a duty-to-defend clause, 43\n\n   • suits by employees to declare non-liability under a covenant not to compete, 44 and\n\n  • suits by a party to declare non-liability for higher or additional payments. 45\nExtending the bar against declarations of non-liability from tort to contract cases would drastically\nhandicap declaratory-judgment practice in Texas.\n\n*669 [18] [19] Third, MBM argues that declaratory judgments are available only if there is\nno adequate alternative cause of action. But this has never been the rule in Texas. Shortly after\nthe Legislature passed the Act in 1943, 46 this Court adopted exactly the opposite rule, stating\nthat “the existence of another adequate remedy does not bar the right to maintain an action for\ndeclaratory judgment” and finding this rule supported by “better reasoning.” 47 The federal courts\nfollow the same rule, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 makes clear: “The existence of another\nadequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.” We\nagree the Act cannot be invoked when it would interfere with some other exclusive remedy 48 or\nsome other entity's exclusive jurisdiction. 49 But prohibiting declaratory judgments whenever a\nbreach of contract claim is available would negate the Act's explicit terms covering such claims. 50\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas has long followed the “American Rule”\nprohibiting fee awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. 51 By contrast, the\nDeclaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to either party in all cases. 52 If repleading a claim as\na declaratory judgment could justify a fee award, attorney's fees would be available for all parties\nin all cases. That would repeal not only the American Rule but also the limits imposed on fee\nawards in other statutes. Accordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use the Act as a vehicle to\nobtain otherwise impermissible attorney's fees. 53\n\n*670 [22] The Act was originally “intended as a speedy and effective remedy” for settling\ndisputes before substantial damages were incurred. 54 It is “intended to provide a remedy that is\nsimpler and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears that a declaration might terminate the\npotential controversy.” 55 But when a claim for declaratory relief is merely tacked onto a standard\nsuit based on a matured breach of contract, allowing fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the\nlimits Chapter 38 imposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under Chapter 37 when they\nare not permitted under the specific common-law or statutory claims involved would violate the\nrule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones. 56 While the Legislature intended\nthe Act to be remedial, 57 it did not intend to supplant all other statutes and remedies. 58\n\n [23] At trial, the Woodlands recovered no damages on its breach of contract claim, so it\ncannot recover fees under Chapter 38. Allowing it to recover the same fees under Chapter 37\nwould frustrate the provisions and limitations of the neighboring chapter in the same Code. 59\nAccordingly, we hold the Woodlands cannot recover attorney's fees under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act.\n\nNevertheless, the Woodlands argues it is entitled to fees because the declaratory relief it sought\ndid more than merely duplicate the issues litigated in its contract and fraud claims. The five\ndeclarations the Woodlands obtained in the judgment were:\n\n   1. that the Woodlands “complied with its contractual obligations to provide notice of its intent\n      not to renew”;\n\n   2. that MBM “improperly failed to timely designate a carrier and location for the return”;\n\n   3. that MBM's manipulation of the termination dates barred it from making “any claim that [the\n      Woodlands] failed to provide timely notice”;\n\n   4. that the Woodlands “relied to its detriment on the termination dates provided by MBM”; and\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

And whether MBM\nmisrepresented the termination dates and the Woodlands relied on those misrepresentations were\nduplicative of the Woodlands' fraud claim. Thus, the declarations sought by the Woodlands merely\nduplicated issues already before the trial court.\n\n***\n\nIt is easy to understand the Woodlands' frustration with MBM. Viewing the evidence in the proper\nlight, MBM withheld information, changed renewal dates, and manipulated the truth to try to get\nmore rent than it was entitled to. It raised dodges, defenses, and counterclaims at various stages\nthat all eventually collapsed in a heap, but only after forcing the Woodlands to incur legal fees and\ncosts. But to recover those fees, the Woodlands had to recover damages for breach of contract.\nThat it failed to do. As Chief Justice Calvert wrote for this Court almost 50 years ago:\n\n             Perhaps every successful litigant should be permitted to recover his attorney\n             fees from the opposite party. But whether that policy would be wise is for the\n             Legislature, not the courts, to decide. Apparently the Legislature has not thought\n             it wise. 60\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that the\nWoodlands take nothing.\n\n\n\nJustice O'NEILL did not participate in the decision.\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2171909\"><a href=\"/opinion/2171909/mbm-financial-v-woodlands-operating-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

As contractor, CBI was\nsupervising the removal by crane of the convection section of a heater unit. An accident occurred\nwhen the crane's load was dropped onto a pipe connected to a storage tank which contained\nhydrofluoric acid, a substance identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\nas a toxic waste. 2 CBI claims that Marathon, in contravention of standard industry practices, had\nfailed to empty the storage tank prior to the commencement of the turnaround and that CBI was\nunaware of the presence of hydrofluoric acid in the tank prior to the accident.\n\nIn numerous lawsuits brought against CBI and others in connection with the accident, residents of\nTexas City and others alleged that they were injured when a large cloud of hydrofluoric acid was\nreleased as a result of the accident. CBI tendered these claims to National Union, Anglo American\nand Rome. All of the companies denied coverage and CBI filed this suit.\n\nThe insurance companies moved for summary judgment on the ground that the “absolute pollution\nexclusions” in their policies precluded coverage as a matter of law. CBI argued in response that\nthe policies, by virtue of these exclusions, contained both patent and latent ambiguities. The trial\ncourt granted summary judgment for the insurance companies before CBI had the opportunity\nto obtain any documents through the discovery process. However, the trial court did accept for\nthe record certain insurance industry documents which, CBI contends, indicate that “absolute\npollution exclusions” such as those involved in this case are ambiguous and will not be read\nliterally to exclude coverage for every situation involving the discharge of pollutants. 3\n\n *520 [1] [2] [3] [4] Insurance policies are controlled by rules of interpretation and\nconstruction which are applicable to contracts generally.

Rather, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion when it rendered\nsummary judgment before allowing discovery. 860 S.W.2d at 666. On that basis alone, the court of\nappeals reversed and remanded to the trial court “without deciding whether there are ambiguities\nin the exclusions.” 860 S.W.2d at 664. The court reasoned that “CBI was not given sufficient time\nto make reasonable attempts to discover evidence on the issue of ‘applying the contract to the\nsubject matter with which it deals,’ and thereby raise a fact issue on latent ambiguity.” Id. at 666.\nIn support of its holding, the court summarized the industry-wide evidence in the record. Id. These\nitems of evidence, the court opined, should have indicated to the trial court that with more time for\ndiscovery, CBI “might have raised a fact issue on latent ambiguity.” Id. The discovery sought by\nCBI is of evidence that its insurers “knew and approved” of industry-wide discussions concerning\nthe breadth of the absolute pollution exclusion and “understood that the pollution exclusions *521\nwould not exclude coverage in construction accident situations.”\n\n [10] [11] [12] The court of appeals relies on the Bache decision, which held that if a latent\nambiguity is discovered when “applying the contract to the subject matter with which it deals,” then\nthe proponent of the ambiguity may introduce parol evidence to establish the parties' intent. Bache,\n611 S.W.2d at 708.

The facts relating to the\naccident, the release of hydrofluoric acid as a result of that accident, and the personal injury and\nproperty damage claims allegedly resulting from that release appear to be fully developed. The\nsurrounding circumstances present when the contract was entered into were amply established for\nthe purpose of determining whether an ambiguity exists in this case on these facts. The discovery\nsought by CBI is not necessary for the application of the contract to its subject matter, but rather\ngoes to the issue of the parties' interpretation of the “absolute pollution exclusion.” The court of\nappeals erred in holding, in effect, that CBI must be allowed an opportunity to discover parol\nevidence going to the parties' intentions in order to create a latent ambiguity. 5\n\n [13] The question to be decided here is whether these insurance policies, by virtue of their\n“absolute pollution exclusions,” are patently or latently ambiguous. On its face, the language of\nthe policies is clear and not patently ambiguous. Nor are the policies latently ambiguous. Applying\nthe policies' language to the context of the claim here does not produce an uncertain or ambiguous\nresult, but leads only to one reasonable conclusion: the loss was caused by a cloud of hydrofluoric\nacid, a substance which is clearly a “pollutant” for which coverage is precluded.\n\nCBI correctly contends that the language of the policies must be interpreted with reference to\nboth the facts of the claim and the facts within the contemplation of the parties at the signing\nof the policies. See Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 394. CBI argues that extrinsic evidence (such as trade\nusage, prior dealings, and prior negotiations) is relevant in interpreting the policies and must be\nconsidered to ascertain whether a latent ambiguity exists. Specifically, CBI argues that extrinsic\nevidence concerning industry-wide discussions of the exclusion at issue here shows that the parties\nshared a mutual, yet unstated, intent that the exclusions would not encompass “accidental” releases\nof pollutants.\n\n [14] Extrinsic evidence may, indeed, be admissible to give the words of a contract a meaning\nconsistent with that to which they are reasonably susceptible, i.e., to “interpret” contractual\nterms. 6 If the contract language is not fairly susceptible of more than one legal meaning or\nconstruction, however, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the meaning of\nthe explicit language of the parties' written agreement. *522 Hubacek v.

In this case, the policies unequivocally deny\ncoverage for damage resulting from pollutants, however the damage is caused. 7 The relevant facts\nand extrinsic evidence necessary to apply this contract exclusion language to the subject matter\nwith which it deals in this case reveals no latent ambiguity.\n\nCourts usually strive for uniformity in construing insurance provisions, especially where, as here,\nthe contract provisions at issue are identical across the jurisdictions.

See Universal, 243 S.W.2d at 157; Lewis, 146 S.W.2d at 980; Murphy, 151\n       S.W.2d at 1005.\n          CBI also contends that one of the inferences that should be made in its favor on summary judgment is that “the policies contain\n          patent ambiguities that preclude summary judgment and cry out for discovery.” Whether the policies contain ambiguities is a\n          matter of law for the court, see Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 394; R & P Enterprises, 596 S.W.2d at 518, not an inference it must make\n          for the purpose of deciding a summary judgment motion.\n6      In cases involving “trade usage” evidence, for example, the meaning to which a certain term or phrase is most reasonably susceptible\n       is the one which so regularly observed in place, vocation, trade, or industry so “as to justify an expectation that it will be observed\n       with respect to a particular agreement.” Restatement (2d) of Contracts § 222(1). See also TEX.BUS. & COM.CODE § 1.205(b).\n7      The National Union policy applies to “any” pollution, and the Anglo American and Rome policies apply to pollution “however\n       caused.”\n8      See, e.g., Heyman Assoc.

The 286th District Court Hockley County,\nAndrew J. Kupper, J., granted summary judgment to operators on certain claims, and, after a jury\ntrial, entered judgment against current lease operators and ordered that royalty owners take nothing\nfrom former operators. Royalty owners and current lease operators appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, James T. Campbell, J., held that:\n\n[1] evidence was legally insufficient to support jury's findings of liability and damages for current\noperator's alleged failure to pay royalties according to amount-realized leases;\n\n[2] evidence was legally insufficient to support jury verdict that current and former operators failed\nto reasonably market gas produced from proceeds leases;\n\n[3] royalty owners' expert's testimony did not comport with state law as to determination of market\nvalue of casinghead gas, and thus did not support verdict that current and former lease operators\nunderpaid royalties;\n\n[4] expert's testimony as to market value of casinghead gas was unreliable, and thus provided no\nevidence to support royalty owners' claim of underpaid royalties; and\n\n[5] current lease operator did not lose title to its personal-property carbon dioxide by injecting the\ncarbon dioxide into hydrocarbon-producing formation to enhance oil recovery, and thus carbon\ndioxide was not subject to a royalty.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(“OPL”), and two former operators of the leases. The royalty owners also asserted a claim\nagainst OPL for royalties on carbon dioxide. The trial court granted summary judgment for the\noperators on some claims, and a jury heard the remaining claims. After a verdict in favor of the\nroyalty owners, the trial court signed a judgment disregarding the jury's award of attorney's fees\nagainst OPL but otherwise awarding the damages found by the jury as to OPL. The judgment\nordered that the royalty owners take nothing from the former operators.\n\nThe royalty owners appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment, its denial of their attorney's\nfees and the take-nothing judgment against the former operators.

The parties agree that the\nroyalty on casinghead gas under four of the leases is one-eighth of the “amount realized from such\nsale” when gas is sold at the wells. The other two leases, the parties also agree, provide a royalty\non casinghead gas of three-eighths of its “market value in the field.” 5\n\nThe six leases range in date from 1934 through 1944. The Slaughter Field is an oil-producing\nfield, and the casinghead gas was flared until sometime in the 1940s when, according to testimony,\nthe Railroad Commission prohibited the practice. In the late 1940s, eight lessees, including the\ndefendants' predecessor Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, jointly constructed the Slaughter Gas\nProcessing Plant. The plant began operation in 1949.\n\nThe lessees individually entered into Casinghead Gas Contracts, beginning in *397 1947, by\nwhich they sold the casinghead gas produced on their leases to the plant owners. The gas contracts\nwere “percentage of proceeds” contracts, by which the plant agreed to pay the lessees 50% of the\nproceeds from the sale of processed residue gas and 33.3% of the proceeds from the sale of natural\ngas liquids (NGLs) from the plant. 6 The term of these gas sales contracts was for the life of the\nSlaughter Plant. 7\n\nIn the 1960s, units were formed for the purpose of conducting secondary recovery operations,\nsuch as waterfloods, to enhance production of oil in the field. Then in the 1980s tertiary recovery\noperations were commenced, by which carbon dioxide is injected into the producing formation,\nalso for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing production of oil. The injected CO2 becomes\ncommingled with hydrocarbons in the producing formation and comes back to the surface along\nwith the casinghead gas.\n\nHigh levels of CO2 interfere with the processing of gas in the Slaughter Plant. 8 As the CO2-\ninjection program expanded in the field, levels of CO2 in the casinghead gas increased. And the\ninjected CO2 migrated to nearby units, so casinghead gas produced from wells outside the units\nin which CO2 was being injected also experienced increased CO2 levels. During the mid–1980s,\nthe owners of the Slaughter Plant constructed the adjoining Mallet Plant to process gas with high\nCO2 concentrations. The CO2 extracted from the gas at the Mallet Plant is returned to the unit\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The CO2 thus follows a continuous cycle\nof injection, recovery, processing and re-injection. The casinghead gas, shorn of CO2, is piped\nfrom the Mallet Plant to the Slaughter Plant for further processing.\n\nIn 1996, BP America Production Company, then known as Amoco Production Company, became\noperator of the Slaughter and Mallet Plants and operator of the leases at issue in the litigation.\nIt later was succeeded as operator of the plant and leases by Altura Energy Ltd. In 2000, OPL\nacquired both the leases and the plants. Thus, OPL now is both seller and buyer of the casinghead\ngas under the gas sales contracts.\n\nUnder the terms of the casinghead gas sales contracts, the casinghead gas is delivered to the\nbuyer at or near the wellhead. Evidence showed that after the gas is gathered from the leases,\nand processed through the Mallet and Slaughter plants, the NGLs extracted from the gas stream,\nand the residue gas available for sale after processing, are transferred to OPL's affiliated company\nOccidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (“OEMI”). OEMI markets the extracted NGLs at Mont\nBelvieu, Texas, near the Houston Ship Channel, and the residue gas at Waha, an El Paso Natural\nGas Co. marketing hub in Pecos County.\n\nIn their suit against BP America Production Company, Altura Energy Ltd. (who we will refer to\njointly as BP) and OPL, the royalty owners contended (1) BP and OPL breached the four amount-\nrealized leases by failing to pay royalty calculated on the actual amount they realized *398 from\nsale of casinghead gas; (2) BP and OPL breached an implied covenant in the amount-realized\nleases by failing to market the casinghead gas as would a reasonably prudent operator; (3) under\nthe two market-value leases, BP and OPL did not calculate casinghead gas royalties on its market\nvalue in the field; and (4) OPL failed to pay a royalty on the CO2 separated from the gas at the\nMallet Plant. The royalty owners moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that\nOPL owed a royalty on CO2. By cross-motion, OPL sought a declaration that the CO2 was not\nsubject to its royalty obligation. The trial court agreed with OPL and granted a partial summary\njudgment accordingly. The remaining issues were tried to the jury.\n\nThe jury found for the royalty owners on all liability theories submitted and awarded them\nattorney's fees. The trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of BP on its\nstatute of limitations defense 9 and in favor of OPL on the award of attorney's fees. The court then\nrendered judgment that the royalty owners recover $7,064,674 from OPL and take nothing from\nBP. As noted, both OPL and the royalty owners appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                   Analysis\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BP raises the same arguments in response to the royalty owners' cross-\nappeal. 10 By cross-appeal, the royalty owners argue the trial court erred in granting judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict on BP's statute of limitations defense and in favor of BP and OPL on\nthe royalty owners' request for attorney's fees.\n\nWhen conducting a legal sufficiency review, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to\nthe judgment and indulge every reasonable inference to support it, crediting favorable evidence if\na reasonable factfinder could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless a reasonable factfinder\ncould not.

Id.\n\nIt is further undisputed that, at all times pertinent to this litigation, the life-of-the-plant gas sales\ncontracts for the sale of the casinghead gas at the wellhead have remained in place, and that the\nlessees have paid royalties to the lessors based on the proceeds received by the lessees for the\ncasinghead gas in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Nevertheless, the royalty owners\ncontend, and the jury found, that the lessees failed to pay royalties in accordance with the leases.\n\nThe royalty owners' expert Charles Graham testified to his opinion that the amount OPL truly\nrealizes for the casinghead gas is not the proceeds it receives under the wellhead gas sales\ncontracts. 11 His opinion focused on the circumstance that OPL, through its acquisition of sole\nownership of both the leases and the Slaughter Plant, is both seller and buyer of the casinghead\ngas. It follows, according to Graham, that the determination of the amount realized by OPL is\nno longer limited to that received under the gas sales contracts. His opinion was that the amount\nOPL realizes for the gas at the wellhead, properly calculated, equals 100% of the proceeds of the\ndownstream sales of the extracted NGLs and residue gas less certain costs. 12 One eighth of that\namount, Graham testified, is the royalty owed by OPL.\n\nWe find Graham's testimony provided no evidence OPL failed to pay royalties as required by the\nleases. First, his theory simply does not comport with the plain language of the leases. Under the\nfour “amount-realized” leases, royalty is calculated on the amount realized from sale only if the\ngas is sold at the well; otherwise, royalty is payable on the market value of the gas. The gas royalty\nlanguage from the 1934 Christine DeVitt “B” *400 lease is typical of the four amount-realized\nleases, stating that the royalty is “on gas produced from said land and sold or used off the land\nor in the manufacture of gasoline, including casinghead gas, the market price at the well of one-\neighth of the gas so sold or used, provided that if and when lessee shall sell gas at the wells lessor's\nroyalty thereon shall be one-eighth of the amount realized from such sales.” There is no dispute\nthat the “such sales” referred to are the sales of gas at the wells. Graham's theory necessarily makes\nuse of the gas sales contracts to establish that the casinghead gas is sold at the wellhead (thus\ntriggering the obligation to pay royalty on the amount realized from “such sales”), then ignores the\nprovisions of the contracts 13 when determining the amount realized from the sale. 14 The royalty\nowners cannot have it both ways. If the gas sales contracts are effective to establish that the lessee\nis selling the gas at the wells, so as to trigger the obligation to pay royalty on the amount realized\nfrom “such sales,” the terms of the same contracts cannot be disregarded in the determination of\nthe amount realized from “such sales.”\n\nMoreover, the proceeds to which Graham pointed as the basis for his theory were not proceeds\nof the sale of gas as produced at the wellhead, but those of the sale of natural gas liquids and\nresidue gas after processing. Graham testified that the amount OPL realized from the wellhead sale\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. at 74. Reiterating the holding of Yzaguirre\nthat no covenant to reasonably market is implied in market-value royalty leases, and finding that\nmarket-value royalty owners are protected from the effects of inter-affiliate transactions by their\nentitlement to receive royalty based on the “objective market value,” the court went on to hold that\nnone of the trial court's listed issues had application to market-value leases, depriving the proposed\nclass of commonality. Id. at 74–75. The statement to which OPL points, “the question under a\nproceeds lease would be whether the proceeds actually received by the lessee were a fraud or a\nsham,” id. at 74, must be seen in its context of the court's discussion of the issues identified by the\ntrial court in that case. We do not believe the Supreme Court intended by the statement to limit the\nduty to reasonably market, when implied, to a duty in all cases simply to avoid fraudulent or sham\nmarketing transactions. Nor do we see anything in the court's opinion in Bowden, which OPL also\ncites, to suggest such a limitation applicable in all cases. 247 S.W.3d at 700 (noting that “Hankins\ndid involve similar allegations that the lessee's intra-affiliate sales transactions were a sham”).\n\n [8] We agree, though, with OPL that in an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence it breached\nits duty to reasonably market the casinghead gas, our inquiry must focus on its behavior, not on\nevidence of other sales. Hankins, 111 S.W.3d at 71. And we agree that the evidence of its breach\nof the duty is legally insufficient.\n\nThe charge asked whether BP and OPL failed to reasonably market gas produced from the proceeds\nleases. In conjunction with the question, the trial court instructed the jury that BP and OPL\nhad “a duty to act as a reasonably prudent operator *402 would act under the same or similar\ncircumstances.”\n\nThe royalty owners argue the evidence showed that selling the casinghead gas for such “meager\nproceeds,” that is, a third of the liquids and half the residue gas, “breaches the duty to market\nbecause [a reasonably prudent operator] would not sell gas to a plant on such low proceeds—\nparticularly when the [reasonably prudent operator] owns and controls the plant.” But, as noted,\nit is undisputed that OPL has paid royalties according to the proceeds under the percentage gas\nsales contracts put in place by its predecessors. Moreover, no witness opined that the percentage\nsales contracts were unreasonable when signed. Graham testified that the lessees' entry into\nthe percentage sales contracts when the Slaughter Plant was built was reasonably prudent. It is\nundisputed also that the terms of those contracts extended for the life of the plant. The allegedly\nbreaching behavior of OPL, then, does not consist of any action on its part but merely its failure\nto change the terms of contracts that came with the properties it purchased.\n\nThe royalty owners emphasize the self-dealing nature of the gas sales contracts, referring to\nthe contracts as OPL's “left hand” selling the gas to its “right hand.” As a pattern for their\nimplied covenant analysis, the royalty owners point to Harding v.

Id. at 467. The royalty owners\ncorrectly note that Harding involved a lessee who occupied both the selling and buying sides of\nan arrangement for the compression of natural gas. On a complaint by his lessors of underpaid\nroyalties, the court held the lessee had breached duties to exercise the diligence of a prudent\noperator and to obtain a market for the gas at the best price obtainable. Id. at 470. Citing his self-\ndealing, the court found that the lessee had acted primarily in his own interest and without regard\nto his obligations to the lessors. Id.\n\nWe do not find Harding persuasive authority on the issues involved here. First, under Oklahoma\nlaw, royalty was payable on the “value” or “market price” of the gas, and Texas does not recognize\nan implied duty to market under a lease with a market-value royalty provision. Hankins, 111\nS.W.3d at 72; Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374. 16 Second, the actions of the lessee in Harding\ninvolved setting up the offending gas marketing arrangements, not simply acquiring both sides of\narrangements that were prudent when established. 17\n\nCertainly Texas implied covenant law takes self-dealing into account. The Texas Supreme Court\nhas noted that the implied covenant to reasonably market oil and gas serves to protect a lessor\nfrom the lessee's *403 self-dealing or negligence. Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374. But the royalty\nowners here seem to assume that a showing of self-dealing is all that is required to show a breach\nof the implied covenant. In fact, their evidence of OPL's breach of the duty to reasonably market\nthe casinghead gas is dependent on its self-dealing. Under the royalty owners' theory, OPL has\nbreached its duty to reasonably market by failing to modify the terms of the gas sales contracts\nprecisely because it, acting alone, has the ability to do so. The royalty owners presented no\nevidence that a reasonably prudent seller of casinghead gas in OPL's position would have any\nability to terminate or modify the life-of-the-plant gas sales contracts if it were not also the plant\nowner, nor did they present any evidence that the terms of a re-negotiated or modified gas sales\ncontract for gas in the Slaughter Field, negotiated at arms-length, would be better for the seller\nthan those of the existing contracts. 18 While the royalty owners produced substantial blocks of\nexpert testimony and documentary exhibits supporting their claims, we agree with OPL there\nwas no proof of what different marketing action was required of a reasonably prudent operator\nunder the same or similar circumstances.

Like their claims under the amount-realized leases, the royalty owners' case under the\nmarket-value leases complained of the percentages of the post-processing sales prices allocated to\nthe wellhead sale, not the product sales prices themselves. Their contention is not that OPL paid\nroyalties based on below-market prices for casinghead gas but that the allocation of only 33.3% of\nthe NGL revenue and 50% of the residue gas revenue to the wellhead *405 under the percentage\nof proceeds contracts resulted in royalties being paid on something less than the market value of\nthe casinghead gas at the wellhead. Accordingly, Alguire testified she compared the 33.3% of\nNGLs, 50% of residue gas percentage of proceeds terms in place here with percentages of proceeds\nbeing paid under other contracts for casinghead gas gathered to a gas processing plant. As Alguire\ndescribed it, her assignment from the royalty owners was “to provide, annually, percentage of\nproceeds that were representative of market value for the casinghead gas in the area.”\n\nThe results of Alguire's study were described in the royalty owners' exhibit 296, which consisted of\ncharts on which were plotted the percentages of the downstream resale prices for NGLs and residue\ngas received by the sellers under various contracts Alguire had reviewed. By plotting the contracts\naccording to their date of signing, Alguire calculated a “market value” for percentages of proceeds\nfor each year during the period 1990 through 2007. As an example, the chart for 1990 shows six\ncontracts signed during that year for the sale of casinghead gas to a processing plant operator on\na percentage of proceeds basis. Under one contract, the seller received for its casinghead gas 50%\nof the proceeds of the downstream sale of NGLs and 75% of the proceeds of the sale of residue\ngas. Other percentages reflected on the 1990 chart ranged from 35% to 75% of NGL proceeds.\nBased on those results, Alguire determined that the “market value” for such proceeds in 1990 was\n60% of NGL proceeds. By her determinations, the “market value” proceeds ranged from 60% in\nthe earlier years of her study to 80% in the years 2001 through 2007.

The study's premise is that there is a “market value” for percentages of\nproceeds. We agree with OPL that Alguire's study and testimony provide no evidence OPL failed\nto pay royalties based on the market value of the gas in the field.\n\nThe royalty owners argue that the downstream prices OPL receives for its processed residue gas\nand extracted NGLs were not at issue in the litigation and their amounts and sufficiency were not in\ndispute. The royalty owners insist that the only dispute with regard to the market-value leases was\nwhether the 33.3% NGLs, 50% residue gas proceeds allocated to the wellhead by OPL constitute\nmarket value in the field. We recognize it is common for casinghead gas to be sold on percentage\nof proceeds terms, 20 and recognize the changes in recent decades in the marketing of natural gas\nand NGLs. Nonetheless, it seems to us that comparing percentages begs the question “percentage\nof what?” Without evidence of the downstream prices for which other gas plant operators sold\ntheir NGLs and residue gas, it seems to us impossible to reach a true market value conclusion.\nEvidence that a seller of gas received 50% of NGL proceeds is meaningless without knowledge\nof the amount of the proceeds.\n\n [21] OPL also contends Alguire's testimony was unreliable, and thus provided no evidence,\nbecause the casinghead gas sold under other contracts she compared was not comparable in quality\nto that produced from the two Slaughter Field market-value *406 leases. We agree with this\ncontention as well.\n\nOne of the two market-value leases is a part of the Slaughter Estate Unit, the other a part of the\nNorthwest Mallet Unit. For the period the royalty owners claimed damages, the Slaughter Estate\nUnit was under CO2 injection. A 2001 revenue audit report prepared by Alguire described the\nnatural gas production as “extremely contaminated, mostly by carbon dioxide.” The report stated\ncarbon dioxide levels exceeded 80% of metered production on the Slaughter Estate Unit and “\n‘roughly 40%’ ” on the Northwest Mallet Unit. Alguire's trial testimony was consistent with her\n2001 report. She said gas produced from the Slaughter Estate Unit during the period contained\nCO2 levels in the 80–90% range. The Northwest Mallet Unit was not under CO2 injection until\nthe conclusion of Alguire's survey period. But carbon dioxide in the gas produced from this unit\nincreased from the 20–30% range in the mid–1990s to the 60–70% range by 2007. Before injection\nbegan on the Northwest Mallet Unit, CO2 migrated there from surrounding properties.\n\nAlguire acknowledged that the comparable sales approach for obtaining market value requires\nconsideration of the quality of the gas. But Alguire conducted her market value study on the\npremise that high levels of injected CO2 should not be included as a comparability factor in the\nmarket value analysis. She explained the rationale for her methodology:\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                21\n\fOccidental Permian Ltd. v.

It seeped in from surrounding areas.\n\n\nAlguire's intentional 21 omission of the high CO2 content of the gas from her comparability\nevaluation 22 improperly injects an entirely subjective factor into the search for what Texas law\ndescribes as an objective calculation. See Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 709 (“[m]arket value leases\nprovide an objective basis for calculating royalties....”); Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 374; Hankins, 111\nS.W.3d at 72 (both also referring to “objective basis for calculating royalties” provided by market-\nvalue royalty provisions). It represents, moreover, the kind of outcome-directed methodology\ncondemned in Robinson. 923 S.W.2d at 559.\n\n [22] Alguire presented lengthy and detailed testimony. But by not considering contracts for sale\nof gas with high CO2 content in her evaluation of the market value of the Slaughter Estate and\nNorthwest Mallet unit gas highly contaminated with CO2, Alguire omitted a material step in the\nquality analysis required by the *407 comparable sales approach. Without a true comparison of\nhydrocarbon quality, too great an analytical gap stands between the data, assuming its accuracy,\nand Alguire's market value opinion. See General Electric Co. v.

While the royalty owners agree\nthat the transported CO2 is OPL's personal property before its injection, they theorize that the\nextraneous CO2 loses its personal property character on injection, is susceptible to capture in the\nproducing formation, and OPL is authorized to capture, or recapture, the CO2 through the grant\nof the leases and provisions of the unit agreements. As captured, they contend, the CO2 is subject\nto OPL's royalty obligation. 24\n\n [26] The royalty owners' claims to a royalty on the injected CO2 depend entirely on the correctness\nof their contention that OPL loses title to its personal-property CO2 when it introduces the\nsubstance into the subsurface producing formation. Although the unit agreements, to which the\nroyalty owners are parties, contain express authorization for the unit operator *409 to inject\nsubstances into the unitized formation, 25 and the unit agreements contain provisions concerning\nroyalty payments, we do not understand the royalty owners to contend that the unit agreements\ncontain a commitment by OPL to pay royalty beyond its royalty obligation under the leases.\nBefore the trial court, the royalty owners asserted that the provisions of the unit agreements\naffecting royalties did not supersede the leases' royalty clauses, but simply constituted an “overlay”\naddressing the manner in which royalty would be paid under unit operations. 26 Thus we consider\nit undisputed that the unit agreements do not require payment of a royalty not already required\nunder the leases. Similarly, the royalty owners make no contention here that the terms of any of\nthe leases entitle them to royalty on the injected CO2 whether or not it became subject to the rule of\ncapture on its injection. Our inquiry, then, is whether, under Texas law, the rule of capture operates\nto subject extraneous CO2 injected and recovered by OPL to a royalty obligation under its leases.\n\n\n  The “rule of capture” is a well established doctrine in Texas which holds that a landowner is\n  entitled to produce the oil and gas in place beneath his land, as well as the oil and gas which flows\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They\n      asserted the discovery doctrine in avoidance of the limitations defenses interposed by BP. OPL acquired the leases and plants in\n      August 2000 but the royalty owners limited their claims against OPL to the period January 2002 through August 2008.\n10    On liability and damage questions like those submitted against OPL, the jury made affirmative findings against BP. While the jury\n      made findings supporting application of the discovery doctrine, as noted, the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict\n      in favor of BP on limitations grounds. On appeal, BP argues the trial court correctly disregarded the findings supporting the discovery\n      doctrine's application. BP further contends that even were this error, no evidence supported the liability and damage findings made\n      against BP.\n11    Graham testified that to establish the amount OPL realized from its sale of the casinghead gas, he looked not to the gas sales contracts\n      but “what the defendants really realized” less “some costs.”\n12    See Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 702 (describing, in class action certification appeal, similar distinction between wellhead prices and those\n      received from downstream sales after processing).\n13    Graham straightforwardly acknowledged that his analysis ignored the percentages stated in the gas sales contracts, opining that the\n      contracts' percentage of proceeds formula was “not binding on” the lessors.\n14    The royalty owners' contention here is thus distinguished from that described in Texas Oil & Gas Corp. v. Hagen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755378\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755378/texas-oil-gas-corp-v-hagen/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n      (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1984), writ dism'd as moot, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1988), in which the court of appeals affirmed trial court\n      findings that a purported wellhead sale of gas by the producer to its wholly-owned pipeline subsidiary was a sham, and that the “true\n      sale” of the gas was off the lease premises, making a market-value royalty provision applicable.

Graham's opinion testimony simply assumed that receipt of proceeds by OPL's affiliate OEMI is to\n      be equated with their receipt by OPL. The royalty owners do not support such an assumption by citation to Texas authority.\n16    As to the substantial differences in the approaches taken by Texas and Oklahoma courts to the lessee's obligation to pay royalty on gas\n      production, see John Burritt McArthur, A Minority of One? The Reasons to Reject the Texas Supreme Court's Recent Abandonment\n      of the Duty to Market in Market–Value Leases, 37 Tex.

It would seem then that analysis of the casinghead gas marketing\n      actions required of a reasonably prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances necessarily would take the consequences\n      of that program, including the resulting high CO2 content of the gas, into account.\n19    OPL also presents arguments that Alguire's opinions were based in part on sales too far removed geographically from those at issue\n      here. We do not reach those arguments.\n20    See, e.g., Bowden, 247 S.W.3d at 708.\n\n21    Alguire's testimony makes clear that her omission of the injected CO2 content from her analysis was intentional. It was a part of the\n      instructions she received for preparation of her study.\n22    Alguire candidly acknowledged on cross-examination, for instance, that her study did not include a single contract for gas containing\n      CO2 in the 50% range with a percentage of proceeds higher than the 33.3%, 50% percentages on which the royalty owners were\n      paid royalty. Later in her cross-examination testimony, Alguire made reference to one contract in New Mexico under which gas\n      containing 25% CO2 was sold for 88% of proceeds. She acknowledged the contract would not be comparable to the higher CO2\n      levels in the Slaughter Estate Unit gas.\n23    Our discussion of this issue applies to the extraneous CO2 transported to the field, injected by OPL into the producing formation and\n      recovered along with the casinghead gas by OPL. The royalty owners contend the summary judgment evidence raised an issue of fact\n      whether OPL is producing CO2 that is “native” to the leased lands. We have examined the documents on which the royalty owners\n      rely for the contention, which are an affidavit of their expert Charles Graham and a memorandum of one of their attorneys. We do\n      not agree that either of those documents provides evidence precluding summary judgment on their claims for royalty on CO2.\n24    As we understand their theory, the royalty owners contend they are entitled to royalty each time the CO2 is recycled through the\n      producing formation.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The parties disagree on the effect of that\n      language but, as noted, we do not read the royalty owners' briefing to contend it would have the effect of requiring payment of royalty\n      not required under the leases.\n27    Relevant to the present facts, the court in Murchison found the law of original capture, which in general gives the owner of land\n      the right to produce all the oil and gas that will flow from a well on the land, inapplicable to gas that was originally captured and\n      subsequently restored. Murchison, 353 S.W.2d at 880.\n28    And we emphasize that we deal here only with a claim for royalty by lessors on extraneous CO2 injected and recovered by OPL. This\n      case does not involve claims of trespass or the like, nor does it involve claims to ownership of CO2 recovered by operators other than\n      OPL. Any such case would involve considerations not present here.\n29    The royalty owners' argument that language concerning gas or gaseous substances in the leases and unit agreements binds OPL to a\n      royalty obligation for CO2, would seem to underscore the similarity between CO2 and natural gas for this purpose.\n30    See, e.g., Tex.

The parties (with the exception of James Bumpurs)\nfiled competing motions for partial summary judgment. The court granted the defendants' motions\nand denied Reagan's motion, decreeing that Reagan take nothing by his suit. Several months later,\nthe court signed a separate order granting the defendants their appellate attorney's fees but denying\ntrial attorney's fees. In the attorney's fee order, the court included a Mother Hubbard clause to\ndispose of any remaining issues and make its judgment final.\n\nReagan claims in three points that the court erred in granting the defendants' summary judgment\nmotions and denying his own because: (1) the plain language of the deeds at issue demonstrates that\nhe retained ownership of the minerals in question and thus the strip-and-gore doctrine should not\napply; (2) the judgment effectively deprives the State of its title to the surface estate of the property\nin question without the State's joinder or consent; and (3) Appellees (with the exception of James\nBumpurs) judicially admitted that Reagan had reserved ownership of the minerals to himself.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Reagan conveyed 55.25 acres to Horace Bumpurs and his wife Evelyn in 1957\nwithout reserving any mineral interests. This tract lies on the northern side of Highway 7, and the\nlegal description in the conveyance expressly follows “the north line” of the highway. 47.679 of\nthese acres are involved in the current dispute.

Marathon drilled a well in this unit which began to produce gas\nin November 1995.\n\nAfter Marathon refused to pay Reagan royalties for his claimed interest in the minerals in and under\nthe 17.134 acres he conveyed to the State, Reagan instituted this lawsuit to obtain a declaration\nof his ownership interest in the minerals located in and under the State's 17.134 acres. Marathon,\nBrounkowski Oil, Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs, and James Bumpurs all filed counterclaims for\ndeclaratory relief asserting that Brounkowski Oil and the Bumpurses own the disputed minerals.\n\nHorace and Evelyn Bumpurs filed a motion for partial summary judgment alleging that Reagan's\n1957 conveyance to them constituted a conveyance of the minerals to the center of Highway 7 as a\nmatter of law because Reagan did not reserve any mineral interests to himself in the conveyance.\nBrounkowski Oil and Marathon filed similar motions alleging that the 1957 conveyance to the\nBumpurses and the 1970 conveyance to Kmiec and Brounkowski conveyed the minerals to the\ncenter of Highway 7 as a matter of law because Reagan did not reserve any mineral interests\nin the conveyance to Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs and his attempted reservation in the Kmiec/\nBrounkowski conveyance is ineffective because of the undivided mineral interests conveyed by\nhis predecessors in title.\n\nReagan then filed a motion for partial summary judgment alleging that he is entitled to judgment\ndeclaring his ownership of the minerals in question as a matter of law because he expressly reserved\nthe minerals in his deeds to the State and the legal descriptions of the tracts conveyed to Horace\nand Eugene Bumpurs and Kmiec/Brounkowski do not overlap the legal descriptions of the tracts\nconveyed to the State.\n\nIn a January 1999 order, the court granted the motions for partial summary judgment filed by\nMarathon, Brounkowski Oil, and Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs. 4 The court denied Reagan's\nmotion. The court decreed that Reagan take nothing by his suit and rendered summary judgment\nin favor of the defendants “on all issues” except attorney's fees and court costs. The court\nsubsequently received evidence from the parties on attorney's fees. The court signed an order in\nMay 1999 denying defendants' trial attorney's fees and granting them appellate attorney's fees. The\ncourt denied Reagan's request for attorney's fees and concluded the order with a Mother Hubbard\nclause.\n\nAlthough a “Mother Hubbard” clause does not necessarily make a judgment final, we treat such\na judgment as final for purposes of appeal if it “actually disposes *76 of every pending claim\nand party.” Lehmann v.

However, our research suggests that the Supreme Court has\ndisavowed this supposed exception to the general rule. 6\n\nThis exception appears to find its genesis in the Couch decision. In that case, John Couch owned\nthe land on both sides of a railroad right-of-way. He sold forty acres of this land located on the\neast side of the right-of-way to Norton and McGown. The legal description in this conveyance\nfollowed the northern line of the right-of way. Thereafter, the railroad drilled a water well on the\nnorthern side of the track in the right-of-way. Couch sued the railroad for conversion of the water\nobtained from the well. See Couch, 99 Tex. at 466–67, 90 S.W. at 860–61.\n\nThe Court acknowledged the general rule recited above but then concluded that it did not apply in\nCouch's case. Id. at 467, 90 S.W. at 860–61. The Court stated:\n\n            At the time the deed from Couch to Norton and McGown was made Couch\n            owned the land on both sides of the railroad, and after the sale the entire right of\n            way remained in connection with his land south of the railroad. Under this state\n            of facts there is no ground for a presumption that Couch intended to convey that\n            portion which lay between the line described in the deed and the railroad track.\n\nId. at 467, 90 S.W. at 861.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

His failure to convey to\n            the center of the railroad right of way did not leave a narrow strip of land\n            disconnected from any other tract. Such strip was as much an appurtenant to the\n            grantor's remaining tract as it was to the tract conveyed. It was as valuable to him\n            as a part and parcel of his remaining tract as it was to the grantee. Evidently Judge\n            Brown declined to apply the presumption because of the recited fact that the\n            grantor, at the time of the conveyance, owned land on both sides of the railroad\n            right of way. There was no other reason for his stating such fact except for the\n            purpose of showing that no basis existed for the application of this presumption.\n\nWeed, 121 Tex. at 443, 50 S.W.2d at 1086–87. In our opinion, the Court began to disavow the\nCouch exception soon thereafter.\n\nIn Cox v. Campbell, T.M. Campbell owned property on both sides of the railroad right-of-way. He\nsold 108 acres along the northern side of the right-of-way to J.R. Castleberry in 1898. He sold fifty\nacres on the southern side of the right-of-way to G.B. Turner in 1904. The legal descriptions in\nboth conveyances followed the northern and southern boundaries of the right-of-way rather than\nextending to the centerline. See Cox v. Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 361–62\n(1940).\n\nIf the Court had followed Couch, it would have concluded that Campbell retained the entire right-\nof-way property when he made the first conveyance. See Couch, 99 Tex. at 467, 90 S.W. at 861.\nSix *79 years later, his conveyance to Turner would have carried with it the right-of-way property\nas an appurtenance to the southern tract. Campbell's heirs asked the Court to follow Couch. See\nCox, 135 Tex. at 437, 143 S.W.2d at 365. The Court acknowledged Couch but observed that “[t]he\nopinion in the Weed case is the latest expression of this Court upon that question, and, unless\noverruled, should control here.” Id. The Court concluded that Weed controlled and determined\nthat Campbell's first conveyance conveyed the northern half of the right-of-way to Castleberry\nand his second conveyance transferred the southern half of the right-of-way to Turner. 7 See Cox,\n135 Tex. at 437–38, 143 S.W.2d at 365–66.\n\nThe Court arguably overruled the Couch exception by implication in Cox. However, we believe\nthat the Court more forcefully did so in Haines. In that case, the parties on both sides of four\nadjoining rights-of-way traced their title to William J. McLean. McLean conveyed the 259 acre\ntract to A.F. Grabow. A county road and two adjoining railroads crossed this acreage at the time\nof the McLean Grabow conveyance. Grabow conveyed 127.8 acres to the east of these rights-\nof-way to D.P. Yoder. Grabow retained the remainder of the acreage until his death, at which\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Court concluded:\n\n            Our Supreme Court has held that the presumption of an intention to convey to\n            the center of an adjoining easement applies notwithstanding the fact that grantor\n            owned on both sides of the easement and conveyed the land on one side only by\n            a description that called for the grant to stop at the outer edge of the easement.\n\nId.; see also Joslin v.

See Haines, 154 Tex. at 277, 276 S.W.2d at 780. Nonetheless, the Court fully endorsed the\nlower court's implied conclusion that Couch was no longer valid when the Court construed Cox\nand its progeny to mean that “even where the grantor owns at the time the land on both sides of\nthe easement, his conveyance of a tract adjoining one side carries fee title to the center line.” Id.\nat 281, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2431141\"><a href=\"/opinion/2431141/haines-v-mclean/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276 S.W.2d at 782.

However, the courts have held that this\ntype of legal description does not rebut the presumption that a deed conveying property adjoining\na public highway carries with it title to the center of the road.

Nevertheless,\nto rebut the aforementioned presumption, a conveyance must contain an “express reservation” of\nthe property in question.

In the Kmiec/Brounkowski conveyance, Reagan and his\nwife conveyed the executive rights in the minerals (attributes (1) and (2) in the Altman listing)\nto the grantees and reserved to themselves an undivided one-half interest in the remainder of the\nmineral rights. 11\n\nHowever, the Reagans' reservation is further burdened by the undivided one-half interest in the\nminerals conveyed to others by Reagan's predecessors in title. The reservation in question provides\nthat any outstanding mineral interests:\n\n            shall be first satisfied out of the oil, gas and mineral interests herein reserved\n            by grantors, so that grantees shall receive by this conveyance an undivided one-\n            half (½) interest in and to the oil, gas and minerals in, on and under the above\n            described 304.22 acres of land, more or less.\n\nThus, as to the minerals in and under Tract Nos. 1, 2, 10, and 11, Reagan conveyed an undivided\none-half interest to Kmiec and Brounkowski and reserved nothing for himself.

The surface ownership of this acreage is as follows: the State owns 17.134 acres; Horace\n        & Evelyn Bumpurs own 55.25 acres; Brounkowski Oil & Gas Partnership, Ltd. owns 304.22 acres; and James & Betty Jean Bumpurs\n        own 1.170 acres. The easternmost 57.789 acres are not subject to the undivided ½ interest in minerals conveyed to others by Reagan's\n        predecessors in title. These 57.789 acres encompass all of James & Betty Jean Bumpurs's acreage and portions of the tracts owned\n        by the State, Horace & Evelyn Bumpurs, and Brounkowski Oil. According to a well unit plat prepared for Marathon Oil Company,\n        these 57.789 acres comprise Unit Tract Nos. 3, 4, and 6. The acreage subject to the previously conveyed mineral interest includes\n        Unit Tract Nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, and 11. In this case, the parties seek to resolve the ownership of the oil, gas, and sulphur in and under\n        the 17.134 acres owned by the State. This acreage runs between Unit Tract Nos. 5, 6, and 9 to the north, and Unit Tract Nos. 2, 3,\n        4, and 10 to the south.\n2       The Marathon plat describes the tract owned by James and Betty Jean Bumpurs as containing 1.170 acres, while the Reagan Bumpurs\n        deed describes the tract as containing 1.026 acres. Because James and Betty Jean are not participating in this appeal, we will not\n        attempt to resolve this variance.\n3       The Brounkowskis executed their lease to Marathon in January 1993. Horace and Evelyn Bumpurs executed theirs in March 1993.\n        James and Betty Jean Bumpurs executed theirs in August 1993.\n4       The court rendered a summary judgment in favor of James Bumpurs in addition to the other defendants. However, James did not\n        file a summary judgment motion. Because Reagan does not contend that the court erred in this regard, the issue is not before us. See\n        Vawter v.

The 81st Judicial District Court, La Salle County, Stella\nSaxon, J., entered summary judgment for defendants, and landowner appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Luz Elena D. Chapa, J., held that:\n\n[1] “surface estate” in agreement governing allocation of royalties from horizontal wells over\nadjoining mineral estates meant portions of earth over which estate owner held dominion after\nseverance of mineral estate;\n\n[2] horizontal well was situated on surface estates of both owner and neighbor;\n\n[3] provision that royalties payable under oil and gas lease from any well or wells shall be paid\nto owner of surface estate on which such well or wells are situated, “without reference to any\nproduction unit on which such well or wells are located,” meant that parties agreed to remove\nwell's location in production unit that included acreage from adjoining parties as basis for one\nparty demanding portion of royalties from well; and\n\n[4] under agreement, “well” meant entire length of underground hole or shaft between owner's\nand neighbor's estates.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CHAPA, Justice.\n\nIn this appeal from a declaratory judgment, we must construe a 1993 contract to determine the\nallocation of royalties from a horizontal well that begins on the property of the appellant, Springer\nRanch, Ltd., but ends under the property of Rosalie Matthews Sullivan, one of the appellees. Our\nconstruction will also govern the allocation of royalties to future horizontal wells covered by the\ncontract. The trial court held the contract required royalties from the horizontal well in dispute,\nand any future horizontal wells crossing the parties' property lines, must be allocated based on the\nproductive portions of the well underlying the parties' properties. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nOrigin of the Parties' Interests\nThe parties to this appeal are the heirs or successors-in-interest to Alice Burkholder, who owned\n8,545 acres of land in La Salle County, Texas, and Webb County, Texas. The property is centered\naround Encinal, Texas. Alice executed an oil and gas lease on the entire property in 1956 that\nis still in force today. Upon her death, Alice's will devised her property interest as a life estate\nin her husband, Joseph Burkholder. The will divided the remainder interest into three tracts and\ndevised the tracts to the parties' predecessors-in-interest. Joseph passed away in 1990, and the\nland was divided in accordance with the will. Springer Ranch, successor-in-interest *277 to\nBarbara Welhausen Springer, holds the portion of the original Burkholder tract “lying North of the\nKrugerville Road and West of Highway 81 [now U.S. Interstate 35].” Rosalie Matthews Sullivan,\nsuccessor-in-interest to Lawrence Matthews, holds the “land lying on the East side of Highway\n81 [I–35].” The “land lying South of the Krugerville Road and West of Highway 81” is held by\nsome combination of O.F. Jones III, Margaret Matthews, Ethel Matthews Rust, and Elizabeth\nMatthews, as successors-in-interest to Anthony Matthews. Springer Ranch and Sullivan own the\nentire undivided interests in their tracts of land and the lease benefits from their tracts. O.F. Jones\nand the remaining Matthews parties have entered into a partition agreement with respect to the\nthird tract.\n\nIn 1993, the parties to this appeal or their predecessors-in-interest executed the contract at issue\nin this case. The contract recites in part:\n\n   WHEREAS, a question has arisen as to the ownership of royalties payable under the\n   [Burkholder] lease to the owners of the various tracts of land above described; and\n\n   WHEREAS, the parties wish to settle such question by means of this instrument;\n\nThe operative language of the agreement provides:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This well, the Springer Ranch No. 2 well (“the SR2 well”), begins\non Springer Ranch's property, crosses the boundary line between Springer Ranch's property and\nRosalie Matthews Sullivan's property, and terminates under Sullivan's property. When Sullivan\nbecame aware of the nature of the SR2 well, she negotiated with Springer Ranch to receive a\nportion of the royalties from that well. After those negotiations failed, she made a demand for a\nportion of the royalties to the well's operator. The operator ceased paying royalties until the dispute\nwas resolved between Springer Ranch and Sullivan. We have reproduced the following image\nfrom the record to illustrate the situation of the SR2 well.\n\n\n\n\n*278 With respect to the SR2 well, Springer Ranch is in the position of “Surface Owner A,” and\nSullivan is in the position of “Surface Owner B.” The illustration does not purport to be to scale.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It moved\nfor summary judgment, seeking a declaration that it was entitled to receive all the royalties from\nthe SR2 well under the 1993 contract, and that the same allocation applied to future horizontal\nwells covered by the contract. Its proposed construction at trial and on appeal is succinctly stated\nin its brief:\n\n   The words in the Royalty Agreement work in harmony to establish a very simple mechanism\n   by which the parties' 1992–93 controversy was settled. “All” royalties, meaning 100% without\n   division, were to be paid to “the” owner, meaning a single exclusive owner, who owned the “the\n   surface estate on which such well [is] situated,” meaning the visible location on the land from\n   which hydrocarbons exited, “without reference to any production unit on which such well or\n   wells are located,” meaning without any regard to the acreage that “can reasonably be considered\n   to be productive of hydrocarbons.” That is what is required by the plain meaning of the words.\n   That construction employs and harmonizes all the words used.\n\nThe defendants (collectively referred to as “the Matthews”) filed a competing motion for summary\njudgment, asking the trial court to allocate the royalties to the SR2 well between Springer Ranch\nand Sullivan based on the location of the productive portions of the well. Their argument rests\non the premise that the SR2 well is “situated on” both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's “surface\nestates” within the meaning of the 1993 contract. Thus, Springer Ranch and Sullivan are entitled\nto “all” the royalties from the “productive portions” of the SR2 well “situated” on their “surface\nestates.” As part of their summary judgment evidence, the Matthews offered the affidavit of a\npetroleum engineer to show how “all” the royalties from the portions of the well “situated on”\nthe respective “surface estates” could be *279 determined and allocated. They also sought a\ndeclaration that the same formula be applied to future horizontal wells.\n\nThe trial court held a hearing on the parties' motions. After the hearing, the court issued this\njudgment:\n\n            (i) the June 3, 1993 agreement referred to by the parties as the Royalty\n            Agreement, concerning ownership of royalties under the October 5, 1956 oil\n            and gas lease recorded in Volume 5, Page 151 of the Oil and Gas Records of La\n            Salle County, Texas, is unambiguous; (ii) the Royalty Agreement requires that\n            the royalties from the Springer Ranch No. 2 well be divided between Defendant\n            Rosalie Sullivan and Plaintiff Springer Ranch Ltd. based on the productive\n            portions of the well situated on their properties; (iii) Defendant Rosalie Sullivan\n            is entitled to receive royalty of .08500689 of production from the well and\n            Plaintiff Springer Ranch, Ltd. is entitled to receive royalty of .03999311 of\n            production from the well; (iv) royalties from any future horizontal wells that are\n            subject to the Royalty Agreement and that are situated on more than one tract\n            of land and owned by any of the parties to this suit or their heirs, successors,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, one of the parties questioned the division orders after\ndiscovering that a well situated on an adjoining party's property was located within a “production\nunit,” almost half of which included acreage from his property. 2 The operator again suspended\nroyalty payments until the 1993 agreement was reached.\n\nIn 1993, each of the three sets of parties had two vertical wells on their “surface *281 estates,”\nwhose “production units” included acreage from an adjoining party's property. Therefore, the\nparties agreed each party would receive all the royalties from the wells “situated on” their “surface\nestate” and would forego any claims to the royalties from wells on the adjoining parties' surface\nestates. Bearing in mind the surrounding circumstances, we turn to the contract's text.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Instead, it is a “legal unit of ownership in the physical land.” Averyt\nv.

But it is fair, when\nconstruing a writing, to equate the “surface estate” with the physical or corporeal structures of the\nearth over which the surface estate owner has dominion, or owns. See, e.g., Dunn–McCampbell\nRoyalty Interest, Inc. v.

In this case, such a construction is necessary if the 1993 contract is to be given\nmeaning under either party's construction. Separate surface and mineral estates do not come into\nexistence until there is a grant of the minerals in a deed or lease, or a reservation in a conveyance.\nSee Moser v.

Therefore, in order to give meaning\nto the phrase “surface estate on which such well or wells are situated,” we construe the term\n“surface estate” to mean the portions of the earth, over which the surface estate owner holds\ndominion after a severance of the mineral estate.

Relying on Coastal\nOil, the Fifth Circuit has determined that “Texas law establishes that the holder of a mineral estate\nhas the right to exploit minerals, but does not own the subsurface mass.” Dunn–McCampbell, 630\nF.3d at 442; see also id. at 441 (“[T]he conveyance of mineral rights ownership does not convey\nthe entirety of the subsurface.”).\n\n [20] Springer Ranch argues that relying on cases dealing with the disputes between the rights\nor boundaries of the surface and mineral estate owners (e.g., Emeny and Dunn–McCampbell) is\nimproper because “[n]one of these cases concern the parties' identification, among competing\n‘mineral estate’ owners, for the purpose of the payment of royalties for the actual production of\noil and gas from the subsurface.” We fail to see why the meaning of “surface estate” should vary\nfrom one context to another. Springer Ranch also argues that treating the well as situated on the\nsurface estate conflates surface estate and mineral estate. We note that the physical structures\nand subsurface substances that the surface estate and mineral estate owners possess are inherently\nintertwined, at least with respect to hydrocarbons. See SMITH & WEAVER, TEXAS LAW OF\nOIL AND GAS § 8.2[A]-[C], at 8–16.8–8–22; 1 SUMMERS, THE LAW OF OIL AND GAS §\n4, at 4–17. Some conflation is unavoidable. However, if there are no minerals beneath the surface,\nthe mineral estate owner owns the legal fiction of an estate that is nothing. Dunn–McCampbell,\n630 F.3d at 441.\n\n [21] In light of the contract's language, physical facts of the mineral and surface estates, and\nthe applicable case law, we conclude that the SR2 well—“the shaft or hole bored or sunk in the\nearth through which the presence of minerals may be detected and their production obtained”—is\nsituated “on” more than one “surface estate,” consistent with the Matthews' construction. Royalties\nfrom the well therefore should be allocated between Springer Ranch and Sullivan.\n\n\n“without reference to any production unit on which such well or wells are located ”\n [22] The contract explicitly bars the payment of royalties on the basis that the SR2 well's\n“production unit” includes acreage from both Springer Ranch's and Sullivan's properties. Springer\nRanch complains that the trial court violated this provision by allocating royalties “based on\nthe productive portions of the well situated on [the parties'] properties,” arguing that the 1993\ncontract bars any division or allocation of the royalties between adjacent parties of the subdivided\nBurkholder tract. We disagree.\n\nAs noted above, the parties have offered competing interpretations of “production unit,” which\nis not a term that carries any standardized oil and gas meaning. Without choosing to apply one\ndefinition over the other, we note that this provision is at the heart of the 1993 contract in light\nof the surrounding circumstances. The contract was made because one of the parties questioned\nwhether he should receive royalties from a well that, although it was on an adjacent party's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The objective\nmeaning of this provision was to remove a well's location in a production unit that included acreage\nfrom adjoining parties as a basis for one party demanding a portion of the royalties from the well.\nTherefore, the parties agreed to allocate royalties on the basis of a well's situation on a party's\nproperty and not on the basis of a well's location in a production unit comprised of adjoining\nparties' acreage.\n\nWe find it unnecessary to discuss the virtues of the parties' competing definitions of the term\n“production unit” because it is clear that the court's judgment does not allocate royalties based\non the fact that the SR2 well's “production unit” includes acreage from both Springer Ranch's\nand Sullivan's properties. 7 That would have been prohibited under the 1993 contract. But the\nallocation of royalties on the basis that a well is situated on two surface estates does not contravene\nthis provision and does carry out the intent of the earlier provision.\n\n\nThe Division and Allocation Formula\nSpringer Ranch argues that if a well may be situated on more than one surface estate, the allocation\nof royalties based only on the “productive portions” of the SR2 well is incorrect, and that royalties\nshould be allocated on the basis of the entire length of the well “on” the parties' property and not\njust the productive portions. We disagree, and conclude the trial court's allocation was a necessary\nconsequence of the contract's language and was supported by the evidence before it.\n\n [23] The contract allocates “all royalties payable under the above described Oil and Gas Lease\nfrom any well or wells ...” A royalty is a fraction of the SR2 well's production, free of the costs\nof production, paid to the mineral lessor. See Heritage Res., 939 S.W.2d at 121–22. Production\nfrom a well, whether horizontal or vertical, is not obtained from the entire length of the well, but\nfrom the part of the well that pierces and drains the reservoir in which the hydrocarbons reside.\nSee 2 SMITH & WEAVER, TEXAS LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 8.2[A]-[C], at 8–16.8–8–22; 1\nSUMMERS, THE LAW OF OIL AND GAS § 4, at 15. A vertical well may produce hydrocarbons\nfrom different formations within its vertical line. See 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.10 (2013)\n(Tex.R.R. Comm'n, Restriction of Production of Oil and Gas from Different Strata). A horizontal\nwell only produces hydrocarbons from the part of the well that lies within the hydrocarbon-bearing\nreservoir, or “correlative interval.” See 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.86(a)(1) (2013) (Tex.R.R.\nComm'n, Horizontal Drainhole Wells). Along the horizontal displacement are takepoints through\nwhich hydrocarbons flow into the well. See Browning Oil Co. v.

See id.\n\nThe Matthews' expert measured the total distance between the SR2 well's first *286 and last\ntakepoints within the correlative interval, the distance between its first takepoint and the property\nline between Sullivan and Springer Ranch's properties, and the distance between the property line\nand the well's last takepoint. The expert multiplied the one-eighth royalty provided under the 1956\nlease by the ratio of the total distance between the first and last takepoints to allocate the royalties.\nHe calculated: “[i]f the royalty were divided based on the length of open drainhole situated on each\nrespective tract, Ms. Sullivan's net revenue interest in the well based on the one-eighth lease royalty\nwould be 0.08500689 (2,615.9/3,846.6 x 1/8) and Springer Ranch's share would be 0.03999311\n(1,230.7/3, 846.6x 1/8).” Springer Ranch did not dispute the expert's measurements or calculations,\nnor did it offer evidence of any other basis for determining how much production was obtained\nfrom the parts of the well on the parties' respective surface estates. Therefore, there is summary\njudgment evidence supporting the trial court's judgment allocating “all royalties” payable from\nthe SR2 well based on the “productive portions of the well situated on [Springer Ranch's and\nSullivan's] properties.” 8\n\n\nOur Construction\n [24] Having reviewed the contract's terms, we agree with the Matthews' construction as it is the\nonly plausible construction. Their construction of the word “well” to mean the entire length of the\nunderground hole or shaft, comports with the legal, technical, and dictionary meaning of the term.\nSee Valence Operating, 164 S.W.3d at 662 (We give the contract's terms “their plain, ordinary,\nand generally accepted meanings unless the contract itself shows them to be used in a technical\nor different sense.”). We see no basis in light of the surrounding circumstance or the text of the\ncontract to limit the term or conflate it with “wellhead.” The SR2 well is situated on two “surface\nestates.” See Emeny, 412 F.2d at 1323; Dunn–McCampbell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182500\"><a href=\"/opinion/182500/dunn-mccampbell-royalty-v-national-park-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441–42 (citing Coastal\nOil, 268 S.W.3d at 15).

We have not altered the meanings of “well,” “on,” “surface estate,” “production unit,”\nor “royalties” to accommodate a change in technology. Cf. id. The intent of the parties was to\nallocate royalties from “wells” without respect to “production units,” regardless of whether the\nparties contemplated the differences between vertical and horizontal wells. Cf. Browning Oil, 38\nS.W.3d at 640 (“The intent of the parties was to authorize pooling, but to prevent the dilution of the\nLueckes' royalties, whether the royalties represented production from vertical wells or horizontal\nwells.”). We have integrated horizontal-well concepts into our construction of the word “royalties”\nbecause, unlike a vertical well, the SR2 well crosses the surface estate of more than one party\nand obtains royalties from takepoints along its entire length within the correlative interval. Cf.\nid. at 642–46 (holding jury charge on damages was erroneous because the remedy for breach of\nanti-dilution provisions must be based on the facts of horizontal-well drilling). We find Springer\nRanch's complaint unpersuasive.\n\nAnother rule of contract construction supports our holding. The Texas Supreme Court has stated\nthat a court should construe contracts “ ‘from a utilitarian standpoint bearing in mind the particular\nbusiness activity sought to be served’ ” and “ ‘avoid when possible and proper a construction\nwhich is unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.’ ” Frost Nat. Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312 (quoting\nReilly, 727 S.W.2d at 530). In Frost, the Court held the court of appeals's construction of an\nequipment-lease agreement with a purchase option provision violated those precepts. Id. at 311.\nThe lessee had attempted to exercise the purchase option and buy the equipment a little over a year\ninto the five-year lease term, but the lessor refused, contending that the contract only allowed the\nlessee to purchase the equipment when the lease term ended. Id. The court of appeals construed\nthe lease to allow the lessee to exercise its purchase right when it terminated the lease little more\nthan a year after it began. Id. at 312.\n\nThe Court reversed and held the court of appeals committed two errors by construing the lease to\npermit the lessee to exercise the purchase option when it terminated the lease early. Id. at 312–\n13. First, the court of appeals committed error by interchanging the words terminate and expire,\nwhich were two distinct ways the lease could have ended. Id. at 313. The Court also held that\n\n            In addition, L & F's and the court of appeals' construction is unreasonable,\n            inequitable, and oppressive. Such a construction allows the lessee to terminate\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 21\n\fSpringer Ranch, Ltd. v.

When the 1993\ncontract was formed, each of the three sets of parties had two vertical wells on their respective tracts\nthat included acreage from an adjacent party's property in their production units. The operator of\nsome of those wells insisted that the parties agree on how the royalties from those wells would\nbe allocated. To resume royalty payments, the parties agreed they would forego claims based on\ncombined acreage within a production unit and would assign all royalties to the owner of the\nsurface estate on which a well was situated. The intent of the parties to the 1993 contract was to\nbar claims for royalties based on “production units,” not to allow one party to directly produce\nhydrocarbons from within the bounds of another's property.

Browning Oil, 38 S.W.3d at 645\n(“The intent of the parties as evidenced by the language of these leases was to award the Lueckes\nroyalties for one-eighth of the oil and gas produced from their land, not to provide a punitive\nremedy for a breach of the pooling provisions.”).\n\nSullivan is entitled to one-eighth of the minerals within the bounds of her property under the lease.\nSee Japhet v.

The\nuncontroverted and only evidence before us shows the productive portion of the SR2 well under\nSpringer Ranch's property is the length of the well between the first takepoint and the property line.\nThe productive portion under Sullivan's property is the length of the well between the property\nline and the last takepoint. The portion of the royalties to which Springer Ranch and Sullivan are\nentitled is determined by the ratio of the productive portions of the SR2 well on their respective\nproperties to the entire length of the well, multiplied by the one-eighth lease royalty. The same\nproration of royalties shall apply to future horizontal wells on the parties' properties.

Springer Ranch argues that “production\n      unit” is synonymous with “proration unit.” In a separate reply brief, Jones argues that “production unit” referred to pooling units\n      created by the various owners of the lessee's interest.\n3     At oral argument, Springer Ranch conceded the normal meaning of “well” included the entire whole in ground.\n\n4     The mineral estate may include more than simply the ownership of hydrocarbons, if there was a general grant or reservation of\n      minerals. Moser, 676 S.W.2d at 101–02 (“We now hold a severance of minerals in an oil, gas and other minerals clause includes all\n      substances within the ordinary and natural meaning of that word, whether their presence or value is known at the time of severance.”).\n      The original Burkholder lease contains a general grant. However, the parties' 1993 contract in this case clearly pertains only to\n      hydrocarbons—which are produced from wells.\n5     If it had been necessary for recovery, the mineral owner likely would have had the authority to inject the gas because “[t]he mineral\n      owner, as owner of the dominant estate, has the right to make any use of the surface which is necessarily and reasonably incident\n      to the removal of the minerals.” Moser, 676 S.W.2d at 103.\n6     Whether that was a valid legal basis for apportioning royalties is not a question before us.\n\n7     Initially, the trial court forwarded a letter to the parties informing them of its summary judgment ruling. The letter stated “[t]he\n      unambiguous meaning of the Agreement that ‘royalties shall be paid to the owner of the surface estate on which the well is situated’\n      is that the horizontal well in question is situated on both Sullivan and Springer Ranch's properties.”\n8     Springer Ranch argues that “producing portions of the surface estate” is nonsensical because the surface estate owner has no rights\n      to minerals. That is true, but the question is not what rights do surface estate owners have to the minerals under their land but rather\n      what “surface estate” means in the context of a contract that allocates royalties on the basis of a well's physical situation.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gulley and State Farm filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In\nGulley's October 2008 traditional motion for partial summary judgment, she argued the damage\nwas covered under both endorsements. In State Farm's April 2009 motion for traditional summary\njudgment, State Farm argued the damage was covered under only the DFE and was, therefore,\nsubject to the fifteen percent cap. State Farm's motion also included a no-evidence portion with\nrespect to Gulley's claim for additional living expenses.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the trial court signed an order denying both summary judgment motions.\nThereafter, Gulley filed a second motion for partial summary judgment with additional evidence,\nand State Farm filed a motion to reconsider its cross-motion for summary judgment as well as a\nnew “Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Actual Injury Rule, Non–Fortuitous Loss, and\nNon–Segregation of Claimed Damage.” On June 9, 2010, the trial court signed an order denying\nall motions, and the case was set for trial on August 23, 2010. On the eve of trial, Gulley's attorney\nsuggested the parties pass the trial date and seek an interlocutory appeal. On August 23, 2010,\nState Farm's attorney sent the following letter to Gulley's attorney, which Gulley's attorney signed\nas “Agreed”:\n\n            Pursuant to our conversation this morning, I am writing to confirm that we will\n            not be trying this case at this time. If we receive notice from the court that we\n            have been assigned, we agree to [1] pass on that assignment, [2] inform the court\n            that we have decided at this time to pursue an interlocutory appeal under Section\n            51.014 ... and [3] request that we be given a new trial date within the next 90 days\n            in the event we are unable to secure an interlocutory appeal for some reason. If\n            you are in agreement, please indicate by signing below and returning this letter\n            to me so that it can be filed as a Rule 11 Agreement with the Court....\n\nIn the meantime, also in August 2010, both parties filed motions to reconsider their summary\njudgment motions. On January 12, 2011, the trial court ruled that both parties' summary\njudgment motions were denied. Within the same written order, the court authorized an immediate\ninterlocutory appeal under section 51.014(d). On January 25, 2011, State Farm's attorney sent the\nfollowing letter to Gulley's attorney, which Gulley's attorney signed as “Agreed”:\n\n   I am writing to confirm the terms of our agreement regarding the contents of the order\n   authorizing an interlocutory appeal.... It is my understanding that you will agree to sign our\n   proposed order *245 which involves only one controlling question of law: [the same as above].\n\n   In return, State Farm will agree that in the event the Court of Appeals accepts this interlocutory\n   appeal [under section 51.014(d) ], State Farm will agree not to assert in any trial following the\n   decision from the Court of Appeals its defenses based on the Actual Injury Rule or the Non–\n   Fortuitous Loss argument. If the Court of Appeals does not accept this interlocutory appeal,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   5\n\fState Farm Lloyds v.

The cause was reversed and remanded to the trial court\nto allow the court “to make a substantive decision on the ‘matter of law’ question presented by the\nparties' competing summary judgment motions.” Id. at 208.\n\nFollowing remand, the trial court considered Gulley's earlier-filed second motion for partial\nsummary judgment and State Farm's earlier-filed motion to reconsider its cross-motion for\nsummary judgment. On August 17, 2011, the trial court granted Gulley's motion and denied State\nFarm's. Sometime in November 2011, Gulley's attorney informed State Farm that Gulley no longer\nwanted an interlocutory appeal, but instead, wanted to go to trial. In December 2011, State Farm\nfiled a “Motion to Enforce Rule 11 Agreement” based on Gulley's refusal to pursue an interlocutory\nappeal.\n\nAt the January 11, 2012 hearing on the motion to enforce, State Farm's attorney stated, “[i]t has\nbeen State Farm's position all along that this really was a matter of law issue and that it should\nhave been decided by summary judgment, which is why we came back twice trying to get that\ndone.” Gulley argued that the reason the parties initially agreed to an interlocutory appeal was\n“neither one of us had a trial ruling on the basic question. Had we had one, we wouldn't need an\ninterlocutory appeal because we would have been able to either settle it or try it based on a [trial]\ncourt ruling.” Gulley also argued:\n\n   ... We thought we could get the Court of Appeals to help us out. They would not do so. And so\n   now we're back where we started at square one, except we do have a trial court ruling. There's\n   no reason for an interlocutory appeal.\n\n                                                      ....\n\n   The basic point is that the Rule 11 [agreement] requires that the Fourth Court have accepted\n   that appeal. And we knew that they might not, because we had not found a case like this where\n   the trial court had not ruled on a summary judgment motion.....\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gulley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n\n\n\nState Farm's attorney responded that Gulley's attorney was referring to the January 25, 2011 letter,\nbut the purpose of the August 23, 2010 letter was that the parties agreed they would not go to trial.\nState Farm's attorney stated he was trying to enforce only the August 23, 2010 agreement, which\n“clearly says we're going to pass on the trial, and we're going to pursue the appeal.” The trial court,\nfrom the bench, initially decided to overrule the motion to enforce, but after hearing additional\n *246 arguments, decided to take the matter under advisement. On January 12, 2012, the trial court\ngranted the motion to enforce, and, on January 27, 2012, State Farm again appealed to this court.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Gulley filed an “Objection on Jurisdictional Grounds to Defendant State\nFarm's Notice of Agreed Interlocutory Appeal.” Gulley argued that because this court “rejected”\nand “did not accept” the first interlocutory appeal, the Rule 11 agreement was no longer binding\non her.\n\n\n\n                                JURISDICTION OVER THIS APPEAL\n\nWe must determine whether the court has jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. Gulley asserts\nthat although she agreed to an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's two orders denying both\nparties' motions for summary judgment, such agreement was conditioned on this court “accepting”\nthat first appeal. Gulley contends this court did not “accept” the first interlocutory appeal and she\nhas not agreed to a second interlocutory appeal of the trial court's August 17, 2011 order granting\nher motion and denying State Farm's motion. State Farm counters that the Rule 11 agreement does\nnot restrict the interlocutory appeal to any specific order, and the agreement “manifests” the parties'\nintent to pursue an interlocutory appeal in order to have this court determine the “controlling\nquestion of law.” State Farm urges this court to interpret and enforce the parties' agreement as it\nwould any other Rule 11 agreement.\n\n [1] [2] Interlocutory orders not disposing of all parties are immediately appealable in only\nnarrow situations permitted by statute.

Both the August 23, 2010 and the\nJanuary 25, 2011 agreement are silent as to any further actions the parties would take in the event\nthis court did not “accept” the interlocutory appeal. There is nothing in the Rule 11 agreement that\nindicates the parties intended the agreement to apply to more than one interlocutory appeal. In fact,\nthe language of the agreement unambiguously limits itself to “this [the first] interlocutory appeal.”\n\n *248 With this court having refused to “accept” the first appeal and the parties finally obtaining\na ruling from the trial court, we conclude Gulley did not agree to a second interlocutory appeal.\nTherefore, the trial court erred when it granted State Farm's motion to enforce the Rule 11\nagreements over Gulley's objection. Because Gulley did not agree to this interlocutory appeal,\nwe do not have jurisdiction and must dismiss. For this reason, we do not reach the merits of the\n“controlling question of law” raised on appeal.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Amended by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 203 (H.B. 274), § 3.01, effective Sept. 1, 2011.

Attached to the tire was a prominent warning label containing yellow and red highlights\nand a pictograph of a worker being thrown into the air by an exploding tire. The label stated\nconspicuously:\n\n\n\n                                                  DANGER\n\n   NEVER MOUNT A 16” SIZE DIAMETER TIRE ON A 16.5” RIM. Mounting a 16” tire on a\n   16.5” rim can cause severe injury or death. While it is possible to pass a 16” diameter tire over\n   the lip or flange of a 16.5” size diameter rim, it cannot position itself against the rim flange. If an\n   attempt is made to seat the bead by inflating the tire, the tire bead will break with explosive force.\n\n\n                                                         ...\n\n   NEVER inflate a tire which is lying on the floor or other flat surface. Always use a tire mounting\n   machine with a hold-down device or safety cage or bolt to vehicle axle.\n\n      NEVER inflate to seat beads without using an extension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck.\n\n      NEVER stand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.\n\n\n                                                         ...\n\n   Failure to comply with these safety precautions can cause the bead to break and the assembly\n   to burst with sufficient force to cause serious injury or death.\n   Unfortunately, Martinez ignored every one of these warnings. While leaning over the assembly,\n   he attempted to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” rim without a tire mounting machine, a safety cage,\n   or an extension hose. Martinez explained, however, that because he had removed a 16” tire from\n   the 16.5” rim, he believed that he was mounting the new 16” tire on a 16” rim. Moreover, the\n   evidence revealed that Martinez's employer failed to make an operable tire-mounting machine\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799645\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799645/uniroyal-goodrich-tire-co-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998)\n\n\n\n   available to him at the time he was injured, and there was no evidence that the other safety\n   devices mentioned in the warning were available.\nIn their suit, the Martinezes did not claim that the warnings were inadequate, but instead alleged\nthat Goodrich, the manufacturer of the tire, Budd, the manufacturer of the rim, and Ford, the\ndesigner of the rim, were each negligent and strictly liable for designing and manufacturing\na defective tire and rim. Budd and Ford settled with the Martinezes before trial, and the case\nproceeded solely against Goodrich.\n\nAt trial, the Martinezes claimed that the tire manufactured by Goodrich was defective because it\nfailed to incorporate a safer alternative bead design that would have kept the tire from exploding.\nThis defect, they asserted, was the producing cause of Martinez's injuries. Further, they alleged that\nGoodrich's failure to adopt this alternative bead design was negligence that proximately caused\nMartinez's injury.\n\nThe bead is the portion of the tire that holds the tire to the rim when inflated. A bead consists of\nrubber-encased steel wiring that encircles the tire a number of times. When the tire is placed inside\nthe wheel rim and inflated, the bead is forced onto the bead-seating ledge of the rim and pressed\nagainst the lip of the rim, or the wheel flange. When the last portion of the bead is forced onto this\nledge, the tire has “seated,” and the air is properly sealed inside the tire. The bead holds the tire\nto the rim because the steel wire, unlike rubber, does not expand when the tire is inflating. The\ntire in this case was a 16” bias-ply light truck tire with a 0.037” gauge multi-strand weftless bead,\nor tape bead, manufactured in 1990. A tape bead consists of several strands of parallel unwoven\nsteel wires circling the tire with each layer resting on top of the last, similar to tape wound on a\nroll. After a number of layers have been wound, the end of the bead is joined, or spliced, to the\nbeginning of the same bead to form a continuous loop.\n\nThe Martinezes' expert, Alan Milner, a metallurgical engineer, testified that a tape bead is prone\nto break when the spliced portion of the bead is the last portion of the bead to seat. This is\ncommonly called a *333 hang-up. Milner testified that an alternative bead design, a 0.050” gauge\nsingle strand programmed bead, would have prevented Martinez's injuries because its strength\nand uniformity make it more resistant to breaking during a hang-up. Milner explained that the\n0.050” single strand programmed bead is stronger because it is 0.013” thicker and that it is uniform\nbecause it is wound, or programmed, by a computer, eliminating the spliced portion of the bead\nthat can cause the tire to explode during a hang-up.\n\nAccording to Milner, Firestone was the first to document that tape beads were prone to break\nduring hang-ups in a 1955 patent application. This application, which was granted three years\nlater, stated in part:\n\n            It has developed that in tires of the type now in common use that the grommet\n            of wire used becomes ruptured or broken too frequently at or near the end of the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Applicant has discovered that such breaking of the bead wire occurs\n            most frequently when the spliced portion of the bead wire grommet is located in\n            the last portion of the tire bead to be seated on the rim, and they have noted that\n            when an end of the said wire ribbon was disposed on the radial inner surface of\n            the bead grommet that the break started at or adjacent to that point.\n\nMilner testified that the design of the bead in the Goodrich tire in question was the same design\ncriticized in the patent. Milner also testified, relying on an internal memorandum that was admitted\ninto evidence, that in 1971 General Tire, one of Goodrich's competitors, knew its tape bead design\nwas prone to break during hang-ups.\n\nIn 1966, 16.5” wheel rims were first introduced into the American market. 1 Milner testified\nthat Uniroyal, Inc. and B.F. Goodrich Company, who in 1986 merged to form Goodrich, soon\nbecame aware that mismatching their 16” tires with the new wheel rims often caused hang-ups that\nresulted in broken beads. The minutes of a 1972 meeting of the Rubber Manufacturers Association\n(“RMA”), of which both Uniroyal, Inc. and B.F. Goodrich were members, provided:\n\n\n   Mounting of LT [light truck] tires. Attention was drawn to reports that there have been instances\n   where 16” LT tires have been mounted on 16.5” rims and 14” tires on 14.5” rims. It was proposed\n   and approved to request the Service Managers Committee to add a cautionary statement to RMA\n   documents.\n   Similarly, the minutes from a 1972 meeting of the Tire and Rim Association, of which Uniroyal,\n   Inc. and B.F. Goodrich were both members, provided:\n\n               It was reported that there have been incidents where 14” and 16” tires have\n               been mounted on 14.5” and 16.5” rims that have resulted in broken beads. The\n               Rim Subcommittee of the Technical Advisory Committee was requested to\n               consider some method of marking 15” Drop Center rims and wheels to avoid\n               this practice.\n\n  Finally, Milner testified that B.F. Goodrich's own testing department was aware by at least 1976\n  that a 16” tire mounted on a 16.5” rim would explode during a hang-up. A B.F. Goodrich “test\n  request” of that year was entered into evidence indicating that a 16” tire would explode when\n  mounted on a 16.5” rim at 73 psi (pounds of pressure per square inch). The test request further\n  indicated that “inspection revealed break was at [illegible] ends of bottom layer of [bead] wires\n  as anticipated.” The stated “Object of Test” was: “To develop demonstrative evidence & data\n  for use in lawsuits involving broken beads.”\nMilner explained that the computer technology required to manufacture the programmed bead\nwas developed in 1972 and widely available by 1975.

Finally, Milner testified that Goodrich itself began using\nthe single strand programmed bead in its 16” radial light truck tires in 1991. 2 Based upon this\nevidence and his expert opinion, Milner testified that the tire manufactured by Goodrich with a tape\nbead was defective and unreasonably dangerous. Because Goodrich had also been sued in thirty-\nfour other lawsuits alleging accidents caused by mismatching Goodrich tires, Milner asserted that\nGoodrich was grossly negligent in failing to adopt the 0.050” single strand programmed bead in\nit bias-ply 16” light truck tires.\n\nMilner also testified that the rim designed by Ford and manufactured by Budd was defective\nbecause its size was not clearly marked on it and because it could have been redesigned to prevent\na 16” tire from passing over its flange.\n\nThe jury found that Goodrich's conduct was the sole proximate cause of Martinez's injuries and\nthat Goodrich was grossly negligent. Furthermore, the jury found that the tire manufactured by\nGoodrich was defective, while the wheel rim designed by Ford and manufactured by Budd was\nnot defective. The jury allocated 100% of the producing cause of Martinez's injuries to the acts\nand omissions of Goodrich.\n\nThe jury awarded the Martinezes $5.5 million in actual damages and $11.5 million in punitive\ndamages. After reducing the award of actual damages by $1.4 million pursuant to a settlement\nagreement between the Martinezes, Ford, and Budd, reducing the punitive damages to the\namount of actual damages pursuant to a pretrial agreement between Goodrich and the Martinezes,\nand awarding prejudgment interest, the trial court rendered judgment for the Martinezes for\n$10,308,792.45.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the award of actual damages, holding that there was legally\nsufficient evidence to support the finding of a design defect based upon its examination of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the availability of safer design alternatives; (2) similar accidents involving\nthe same product; (3) subsequent changes or modifications in design; (4) out-of-court experiments\nindicating Goodrich's knowledge of a design defect; and (5) expert testimony claiming a design\ndefect. 928 S.W.2d at 70. The court rejected Goodrich's argument that Martinez's failure to heed\nthe product's warnings was a complete defense to the product defect claim. However, the court of\nappeals reversed and rendered the award of punitive damages, holding that there was no evidence\nto support the jury's finding of gross negligence.\n\nOnly Goodrich applied to this Court for writ of error. As in the court of appeals, Goodrich's\nprincipal argument here is that no evidence supports the jury finding that the tire was defective\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS\nLIABILITYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY § 2(b). Section 2(b) provides:\n\n            A product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by\n            the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable\n            alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n            commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design\n            renders the product not reasonably safe.\n\nTo determine whether a reasonable alternative design exists, and if so whether its omission renders\nthe product unreasonably dangerous (or in the words of the new Restatement, not reasonably\nsafe), the finder of fact may weigh various factors bearing on the risk and utility of the product.\nSee Caterpillar, 911 S.W.2d at 383–84; Turner v.

See Turner, 584 S.W.2d at 847. The new Restatement likewise carries forward this\napproach:\n\n\n  A broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative design\n  is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably safe. The factors\n  include, among others, the magnitude and probability of the foreseeable risks of harm, the\n  instructions and warnings accompanying the product, and the nature and strength of consumer\n  expectations regarding the product, including expectations arising from product portrayal and\n  marketing.... The relative advantages and disadvantages of the product as designed and as it\n  alternatively could have been designed may also be considered.

The new Restatement, however,\nexpressly rejects the Comment j approach:\n\n            Reasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the\n            production and distribution of reasonably safe products. In general, when a safer\n            design can reasonably be implemented and risks can reasonably be designed out\n            of a product, adoption of the safer design is required over a warning that leaves\n            a significant residuum of such risks. For example, instructions and warnings\n            may be ineffective because users of the product may not be adequately reached,\n            may be likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the\n            instructions or heed the warnings. However, when an alternative design to avoid\n            risks cannot reasonably be implemented, adequate instructions and warnings\n            will normally be sufficient to render the product reasonably safe. Compare\n            Comment e. Warnings are not, however, a substitute for the provision of a\n            reasonably safe design.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. l (emphasis added).\nThe Reporters' Notes in the new Restatement refer to Comment j as “unfortunate language”\nthat “has elicited heavy criticism from a host of commentators.” RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF\nTORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2, Reporters' Note, cmt. l (citing Latin, Good Warnings,\nBad Products, and Cognitive Limitations, 41 U.C.L.A.

Similarly, this Court has indicated that the fact that a danger is open and obvious\n(and thus need not be warned against) does not preclude a finding of product defect when a safer,\nreasonable alternative design exists. See Caterpillar, 911 S.W.2d at 383. (“A number of courts are\nof the view that obvious risks are not design defects which must be remedied.

Rather, as we\nhave explained, we agree with the new Restatement that warnings and safer alternative designs\nare factors, among others, for the jury to consider in determining whether the product as designed\nis reasonably safe. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2\ncmt. f. While the dissenting justices say that they also agree with the Restatement's approach, they\nwould, at least in this case, remove the balancing process from the jury. Instead, they would hold\nthat Goodrich's warning rendered the tape bead design reasonably safe as a matter of law.\n\n[7] The dissenting justices first argue that Goodrich's warning was clear and that it could have\nbeen followed, and consequently Martinez was injured only by “[i]gnoring ... his own good sense.”\nPost at 343.

The jury also heard evidence that Goodrich's competitors\nhad incorporated the single strand programmed bead by the early 1980s, and that Goodrich itself\nadopted this design in 1991, a year after manufacturing the tire that injured Martinez. Under these\ncircumstances, there is at least some evidence supporting the jury's finding of product defect.\n\n\n\n                                                        III\n\n [8] Goodrich argues that even if its Comment j argument does not prevail, it is still entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law because no safer alternative was available. In response, the Martinezes\npoint to the evidence that Goodrich's competitors, and eventually Goodrich itself, adopted the safer\n0.050” single strand programmed bead. Goodrich counters that this alternative design is not in fact\nsafer because if the tire is matched to the wrong size rim the bead will never seat on the rim and\nit will inevitably explode during use.\n\nWe agree with the general proposition that a manufacturer should not be liable for failing to\nadopt an alternative design that would, under other circumstances, impose an equal or greater\nrisk of harm. To prevail in a design defect case, a plaintiff should be required to show that the\nsafety benefits from its proposed design are foreseeably greater than the resulting costs, including\nany diminished usefulness or diminished safety. See Owen, Toward a Proper Test for Design\nDefectiveness: “Micro–Balancing” Costs and Benefits, 75 TEX. L. REV. 1661, 1690 (1997). As\nthe new Restatement explains:\n\n            When evaluating the reasonableness of a design alternative, the overall safety\n            of the product must be considered. It is not sufficient that the alternative\n            design would have reduced or prevented the harm suffered by the plaintiff if it\n            would also have introduced into the product other dangers of equal or greater\n            magnitude.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt. f.\n\nThe Martinezes, however, offered some evidence that their alternative design not only would\nhave prevented the injury to Martinez, but also that it would not have introduced *338 other\ndangers of equal or greater magnitude. It is undisputed that the single strand programmed bead\nis more resistant to breaking in mismatch situations. Goodrich expert Tom Conner testified that\nin a mismatch situation the tape bead may break at 60 psi, while a single strand bead will not\nbreak until at least 130 psi. Conner also testified that he has never heard of a single strand bead\nbreaking during the inflating of a mismatched tire.

Both Conner and\nLew testified that they would prefer a tire inflated by their loved one to have a single strand bead.\n\nIt is true that Goodrich also offered some evidence that the single strand programmed bead would\nhave introduced other dangers of equal or greater magnitude because of the risk of “in service”\nblow-outs. Lew testified that even if a 16” tire was successfully mounted on a 16.5” rim, the tire\nwill fail when used on the road. Conner, a forensic scientist, also stated that both laboratory and\nroad testing revealed that if a 16” tire was mounted on a 16.5” rim the tire will blow out when\ndriven on the road. However, Conner testified that in his 25 years of experience in the tire industry\nhe has never heard of a “single person in the world” that has been hurt by a 16” tire on a 16.5” rim\n“out in service.” Lew testified on direct examination:\n\n   Q: Have you personally seen any examples of where the Goodyear programmed single strand\n     bead used in some but not all of its tires failed in service on the wrong sized wheel?\n\n   A: No; I haven't seen any.\n\nLew further testified:\n\n   Q: Tell me one person's name from any tire you have ever seen where it's failed in service when\n     a 16's mounted on a 16.5.\n\n   A: Fine and I told you at my deposition that no; I don't know a single name.\n\n   Q: All right. Tell me one single name of a persons [sic] that's been injured in a mismatch\n     explosion of a single strand bead?\n\n   A: Again, I don't know of any.\n\nThis evidence does not conclusively prove that the programmed bead would have introduced into\nthe product other dangers of equal or greater magnitude. There was thus a fact issue regarding\nwhether a reasonable alternative design existed, which the jury resolved in favor of the Martinezes.\n\n\n\n                                                        IV\n\n [9] Goodrich next asserts that the evidence conclusively establishes that the tire rim designed\nby Ford Motor Company and manufactured by the Budd Company was defective and that such\ndefect contributed to Martinez's injuries, so that the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial\ncourt's judgment based on the jury's answers that the rim was not defective and did not contribute\nto the injury. Goodrich points to Milner's undisputed testimony that the rim was defective because\nit could have been redesigned to prevent a 16” tire from passing over its flange.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Goodrich argues that\nthis subject *339 matter is for experts alone because the jury could not have determined, without\nthe benefit of expert testimony, that a safer, feasible, alternative design existed.\n\nWe agree that expert testimony was probably necessary to show the feasibility of the alternative\nrim design which would have prevented a mismatched tire from passing over the rim flange.\nOnce a feasible alternative design was shown, however, the question remained whether the rim as\ndesigned was unreasonably dangerous. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS\nLIABILITY § 2(b) (product is defective in design when risks could have been reduced by adoption\nof reasonable alternative design and omission of the alternative design renders the product not\nreasonably safe). We conclude that the jury could properly determine whether the rim as designed\nwas unreasonably dangerous, and that it was not required to follow expert testimony on this\nissue. Milner's expert testimony thus does not conclusively establish that the rim was defective.\nCf. McGalliard, 722 S.W.2d at 697 (house repairs); Broussard v.

Moreover, where the subject matter is not solely\nfor experts, uncontroverted opinion testimony is not conclusive, regardless of whether it comes\nfrom an expert or a lay witness.

Thus, the jury was entitled to reject the opinion testimony\nthat the rim was defective, regardless of whether it was from an expert, Martinez, or Martinez's\nco-worker.\n\n [12] The dissent also argues that, even without any opinion testimony, the record conclusively\nestablishes that the rim was defective. Milner testified that the rim could have been redesigned to\nprevent a 16” tire from being mounted on it, possibly by filling the wheel well so that it was not\nas deep. However, while this is some evidence of a feasible alternative design, it is not conclusive\nevidence of an unreasonably dangerous product, given the factors that a jury must balance under\nthe Restatement. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 2 cmt.\nf. For example, there was no evidence of whether the alternative design would affect production\ncosts, the rim's road characteristics, or the relative ease of mounting and dismounting the correct\nsize tire.\n\nThe dissent also argues that the rim is defective as a matter of law because its size was not\nprominently marked on it. Milner and Conner both testified that the rim's size should be displayed\nclose to the valve stem to reduce the risk of an accidental mismatch. Milner further testified that\nthe size should also be displayed in the wheel well, as some other manufacturers had done. Milner\npointed out, however, that “this wheel's probably been cleaned since [the accident] so that the\nexistence of [a size marking] wouldn't necessarily mean that [Martinez] would see it.” Indeed,\nMartinez's co-worker testified that at the time of the accident the wheel was so covered with\ncaliche that “it looked white.” Based on this evidence, the jury could have concluded that a size\nmarking near the valve stem would have been obscured, and would not have been seen by Martinez.\nSimilarly, the jury was entitled to conclude that Martinez would not have seen a size marking or\nwarning in the well of the wheel while he was in the process of mounting a tire on the wheel. Thus,\neven if the dissent were correct that the rim was defective as a matter of law because its size was\nnot clearly marked, *340 the evidence does not conclusively establish that any such defect was\na producing cause of Martinez's injury. Because the issues of rim defect and producing causation\nwere both submitted to the jury in one broad-form question, the jury's negative answer to that\nquestion is not contrary to the conclusive evidence.\n\n\n\n                                                         V\n\nGoodrich also argues that the evidence conclusively establishes that Martinez was negligent and\nthat he contributed to his own injuries. Specifically, Goodrich argues that unless some defect in\nthe warning hinders a plaintiff's ability to see and heed it, the failure to see and heed a warning\nis conclusive proof of contributory negligence.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Both Martinez and his co-worker Ramundo Regalado testified that,\nbecause they had removed 16” tires from the rims on which they were working, they assumed\nthat the rims were also 16”. Also, although there was a tire-changing machine on the premises,\nthe evidence was conflicting as to whether Martinez could have used it to secure the tire.\nRene Vera, Martinez and Regalado's employer, testified that the tire-changing machine, although\ninoperable for dismounting tires, could have nonetheless been used to secure the tire during\ninflation. Regalado testified, however, that the tire-changing machine did not work, despite his\nrepeated requests to the safety foreman to have it repaired, and that had it worked he and Martinez\nwould have been using it on the day of the accident to secure the tire. Thus, Goodrich failed to\nconclusively prove that Martinez was negligent in failing to use the machine. There is no evidence\nthat the other safety devices referenced in the tire warning—a safety cage or an extension hose—\nwere available to Martinez. Further, Goodrich offered no evidence as to whether it was practical or\nfeasible under the circumstances for Martinez to bolt the rim to a vehicle axle in order to inflate the\ntire and seat the bead. Both Martinez and Regalado testified that the manner in which Martinez was\ninflating the tire was customary in their shop. Based upon this evidence, we cannot conclude that\nreasonable people could not differ about whether Martinez failed to exercise ordinary prudence\nunder the circumstances.\n\nBecause we conclude that Goodrich did not conclusively establish that Martinez was negligent,\nwe do not address Goodrich's argument that there is no evidence to support the jury's allocation\nof causation.\n\n\n\n                                                        VI\n\n [15] Goodrich next argues that even if it is not entitled to a rendition of judgment, it is entitled to\na new trial because of three reversible evidentiary rulings.

Like this case, the earlier accidents resulted from mounting a 16”\nGoodrich tire with a tape bead on a 16.5” rim. The absence of pictographic warnings on the tires\ndoes not render the accidents so dissimilar as to preclude their admission, but merely goes to the\nweight of the evidence. The trial court did not commit error by admitting evidence of the thirty-\nfour earlier accidents caused by mismatching Goodrich tires. 7\n\n [17] Goodrich next complains that the trial court erred by admitting evidence that Goodrich\nsubsequently redesigned its radial light truck tires to incorporate the single strand programmed\nbead, because radial tires are fundamentally different from the bias-ply tire that injured Martinez,\nand the bead change was not made in the radial tires for safety reasons. Goodrich first argues\nthat, under these circumstances, the evidence regarding radial tires violates Texas Rule of Civil\nEvidence 407(a).\n\nRule 407(a) states:\n\n            Subsequent Remedial Measures. When, after an event, measures are taken\n            which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur,\n            evidence of the subsequent remedial measures is not admissible to prove\n            negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. This rule does\n            not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures when\n            offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control or feasibility of\n            precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment. Nothing in this rule\n            shall preclude admissibility in products liability cases based on strict liability.\n\nTEX.R. CIV. EVID. 407(a) (emphasis added). Goodrich argues that this rule only permits the\nadmission of subsequent remedial measures involving the product at issue, and that such measures\nmust have been made for safety reasons. However, the rule does not contain these limitations.\nRather, under the express language emphasized above, Rule 407(a) simply does not apply in\nproducts liability cases based on strict liability. Thus, the trial court did not violate Rule 407(a). 8\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    24\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

Goodrich appears to argue that it was harmed by this evidence because\nthe jury could have improperly inferred that, because Goodrich incorporated the single strand\nprogrammed bead into its radial tires, such redesign was feasible and necessary for the bias-ply\ntire involved in this accident. However, there was independent evidence that the single strand\nprogrammed bead was feasible for bias-ply tires as early as 1982, when General Tire adopted that\ndesign, and that the programmed bead was safer. Under these circumstances, the trial court did\nnot commit reversible error by admitting *342 evidence of Goodrich's redesign of its radial tires.\n\nRaising similar arguments, Goodrich also contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence\nof Goodrich's redesign of its “space saver” spare tires. For the reasons discussed above regarding\nthe radial tires, the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting this evidence.\n\nGoodrich's final evidentiary complaint is that the trial court committed reversible error by\nadmitting a “time line” chart prepared by the Martinezes' expert and used by him during trial.\nSpecifically, Goodrich complains that the time line contained a self-serving compilation of hearsay\nevidence both irrelevant to the issues in this lawsuit and unfairly prejudicial to Goodrich.\n\n [19] [20] Charts and diagrams that summarize, or perhaps emphasize, testimony are admissible\nif the underlying information has been admitted into evidence, or is subsequently admitted\ninto evidence.

In Keever, we stated that “[a]lthough Moriel was decided after the court of appeals'\ndecision in this case, its holding should be applied to a pending case in which a party has preserved\nthe complaint that the court of appeals failed to properly scrutinize a punitive damage award.” Id.\nat 799. Since Goodrich presented the trial court with a timely motion, the trial court, consistent\nwith our ruling in Keever, should have bifurcated the determination of the amount of punitive\ndamages from the remaining issues.\n\nHaving determined that the trial court erred in refusing to bifurcate the trial, we must determine\nwhether the trial court's error was reasonably calculated to cause and probably did cause rendition\nof an improper judgment. See TEX.R.APP. P. 61.1 The rationale given for bifurcation in Moriel\nwas that “evidence of a defendant's net worth, which is generally relevant only to the amount of\npunitive damages, by highlighting the relative wealth of a defendant, has a very real potential for\nprejudicing the jury's determination of other disputed issues in a tort case.” Moriel, 879 S.W.2d\nat 30. Here, the jury was not presented with any evidence of Goodrich's net worth. While we\ndo not hold that net worth evidence is the only prejudice that may result from trying actual and\npunitive *343 damage claims together, there is no prejudice in this case requiring a reversal of\nthe judgment. Goodrich argues that the Martinezes were free to indulge in inflammatory argument\nfor a high punitive damage award that would not have been permitted in the liability phase had\nbifurcation been granted. Specifically, Goodrich argues that it was severely prejudiced by the\nMartinezes' plea for $500,000 for each of the thirty-four other lawsuits filed against Goodrich so\nas to send a “message back to Akron.” Because the other suits were properly in evidence on the\nissue of liability, however, we conclude that this jury argument was not so prejudicial to the actual\ndamages claim as to require a reversal.\n\n\n\n                                                       ***\n\nBecause we conclude that there is some evidence to support the judgment of the court below on\nthe theory of products liability, we need not consider Goodrich's claim that there is no evidence\nas to negligence. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\ndissenting opinion issued July 3, 1998 is accordingly withdrawn, and this opinion substituted.\n\nHaving changed about a thousand tires in his life, Roberto Martinez admits he knew better than to\nlean over a tire while inflating it. Besides, he had seen the pictographic warning on the very tire\nhe was changing which showed a worker being hurt by an exploding tire and warned: “NEVER\nstand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.” Ignoring this warning and his own good\nsense, Martinez was leaning over the tire, inflating it, when it exploded in his face.\n\nThe 16” tire exploded because it would not fit the 16.5” wheel on which Martinez was trying to\nmount it. Martinez knew it was very dangerous to try to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” wheel, and he\nwould never knowingly have tried to do it, but the size of the wheel was not marked where he could\nfind it. He understood that his co-worker had taken a 16” tire off the wheel, and he was simply\ntrying to put the same size tire back on. The Budd Company, which manufactured the wheel to\nFord Motor Company's specifications, knew, as did Ford, that people sometimes try to mount 16”\ntires on 16.5” wheels, not realizing that tire and wheel are mismatched. To minimize the risk of\nsuch mistakes, Budd and Ford could have changed the design of the wheel to prevent mounting\nmismatched tires, but they did not do so. Budd could also have simply stamped the size in plain\nview on the outboard side of the wheel near the valve stem where it was almost sure to be seen, but\nit did not do that, either. Instead it encoded the size in small letters on the inboard side, where it was\nhard to find if the wheel was clean, and indecipherable if the wheel was dirty, as it was in this case.\n\nAlthough a 16.5” wheel can be designed so that a 16” tire cannot be mounted on it, a 16” tire cannot\nbe designed so that it cannot be mounted on a 16.5” wheel. A tire manufacturer's only options\nto reduce the risk of injury from attempting to mount a 16” tire on a 16.5” wheel are to place a\nwarning on the tire or to design the bead wire so that it will withstand higher inflation pressure\nbefore exploding. The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, which made the tire Martinez was using,\nchose to put a prominent, pictographic label on it, which, as I have said, Martinez actually saw but\ndid not heed. Had he done so, he would not have been injured. In fact, according to the record,\nonly one other person has ever claimed to have been injured attempting to mount a 16” tire with a\nwarning label like Goodrich's on a 16.5” wheel, although thousands of labeled tires and more than\nthirty million 16.5” wheels have been manufactured in the past two decades.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The reader may be surprised at the answer in this case.\nMartinez, though negligent by his own admission, is held to bear no responsibility for the accident.\nThe wheel manufacturers, too, are held to be free of responsibility (they settled with Martinez\nbefore trial) although the undisputed testimony by both Martinez's and Goodrich's experts is that\nBudd and Ford defectively designed the wheel. Only Goodrich is held liable—and for providing a\nwarning on the tire that would have prevented Martinez's accident altogether instead of redesigning\nthe bead wire so that the accident would only have been less likely. This aberrant result flows from\nfour serious flaws in the Court's opinion which, even more importantly, misstate the law that will\nbe applied in other cases.\n\nFirst, the Court holds that a product can be found to be defective whenever it could be more safely\ndesigned without substantially impairing its utility. This is not, and should not be, the law. As\nthe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability advises, a “broad range of factors” besides\nthe utility of a reasonable alternate design should be considered in determining whether its use\nis necessary to keep the product reasonably safe, including “the magnitude and probability of the\nforeseeable risks of harm [and] the instructions and warnings accompanying the product”. 1 When\nthe undisputed evidence is that the magnitude and probability of a risk are low, an alternative\ndesign could reduce but not eliminate that risk, and the instructions and warnings given do\neliminate the risk, the product should be determined not to be defective as a matter of law.\n\nSecond, the Court holds that whether a wheel is defectively designed “because its size is not clearly\nmarked or because its design allows a mismatched tire to be placed on it” can be decided by “lay\njurors, based on their own experience and common sense,” unaided by expert opinion. 2 It follows\nthat a plaintiff, by offering no evidence other than his own lay opinion, could prove that a wheel\nwas defectively designed—that is, that risks of harm were foreseeable, that there was a reasonable\nalternative design that would reduce and avoid them, and that the omission of the design rendered\nthe product not reasonably safe. I doubt whether such lay testimony would support a judgment\nin any design defect case. 3 The record in this case proves that such evidence could not possibly\nsupport a judgment for Martinez.\n\nThird, the Court holds that evidence of thirty-four other claims of injury over fifteen years from\ntrying to mount 16” Goodrich tires on 16.5” wheels was admissible without proof that any of the\nclaims were valid—some were undisputedly invalid—or that they arose out of accidents similar to\nMartinez's. A few weeks ago the Court held that evidence of anticipated or unpaid punitive damage\nclaims is irrelevant and inadmissible to show punitive damage liability. 4 Today the Court holds\nthat evidence of other claims—whether proven or not, and whether similar or not—is relevant and\nadmissible to show liability. The Court also holds that an expert may testify that a product has\ncaused serious injury and death when no basis at all has been shown for the statement.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Today's opinion undermines the bifurcation requirement of\nTransportation Insurance Co. v. Moriel. 5\n\nBecause I disagree with all these holdings, for reasons I now explain in more detail, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n\n                                                      *345 I\n\nComment j to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts states:\n\n            Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read\n            and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is\n            followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. 6\n\nWe have followed the first clause of comment j, but only to the extent of holding that a plaintiff\nis entitled to a rebuttable presumption that had he been adequately warned of the dangers of a\nproduct, he would have avoided injury, despite the fact that experience teaches that “it is not at\nall unusual for a person to fail to follow basic warnings and instructions.” 7 The presumption is\nmerely a procedural device to obviate the necessity of plaintiff's self-serving testimony that he\nwould have heeded adequate warnings. 8 In making the presumption rebuttable we recognized that\nthe first clause is not always true. Further, we have never followed the second clause of comment j,\nand now the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability has withdrawn comment j altogether\nas “unfortunate language” that “has elicited heavy criticism from a host of commentators.” 9 The\nCourt's firm rejection of comment j, which the Court has never adopted and the Restatement has\nnow itself rejected, is perhaps beating a dead horse, but I agree that comment j does not correctly\nstate what the law is or should be.\n\nSince it is human nature to disregard instructions, a rule that any product is reasonably safe as\nlong as it bears an adequate warning of the risks of its use is not feasible. Such behavior, however,\ndoes not warrant the opposite rule that warnings are irrelevant in determining whether a product\nis reasonably safe. I agree with the Court that comment l to Section 2 of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts: Products Liability now has it about right:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In general, when a safer\n            design can reasonably be implemented and risks can reasonably be designed out\n            of a product, adoption of the safer design is required over a warning that leaves\n            a significant residuum of such risks. For example, instructions and warnings\n            may be ineffective because users of the product may not be adequately reached,\n            may be likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the\n            instructions or heed the warnings. However, when an alternative design to avoid\n            risks cannot reasonably be implemented, adequate instructions and warnings\n            will normally be sufficient to render the product reasonably safe. Warnings are\n            not, however, a substitute for the provision of a reasonably safe design. 10\n\nI do not agree, however, that the Court correctly reads or follows comment l. Comment l limits\nbut does not foreclose the role of warnings in making products reasonably safe, even when there\nis a safer alternative design. The Court stresses the last sentence of comment l and brushes past\nthe first sentence. Taken as a whole, the comment says, correctly, I think, that a safer alternative\ndesign that eliminates a risk is required over a warning that leaves a significant residuum of risk\nbecause product users may not get the warning, may be inattentive, or may not be motivated to\nheed the warning. The illustration accompanying comment l is of a worker whose foot is severed\nby a garbage truck's blade and compaction chamber when he loses his balance jumping onto the\nback of the truck. 11 A warning on the truck, “keep hands and feet away”, does little to protect\n *346 against a worker's foreseeable inadvertence or misstep in the usual discharge of his job.\nBut the warning might well be adequate admonishment to the merely curious, even if the garbage\ntruck could be designed to be safer, if the residuum of risk were insignificant. Even if the risk\nthat a worker will lose his balance and slip is significant enough to warrant designing additional\nprotections in the truck, the risk that someone will intentionally stick his hand in a place where it\nobviously may be hurt when he is effectively warned not to do so may not warrant design changes.\n\nSection 2(b) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability states the applicable rule:\n\n            A product ... is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by\n            the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable\n            alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the\n            commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design\n            renders the product not reasonably safe. 12\n\nThere are two components to this rule: the possibility of a safer, reasonable alternative design, and\na product that is not reasonably safe without that design. Both are required. Even if a reasonable\nalternative design would make a product safer, the product is not defective unless the omission of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The comparison is not between the two designs,\nbut between the product alternatively designed and the product including any warning. Comment\nf to Section 2 explains:\n\n            Subsection (b) states that a product is defective in design if the omission of\n            a reasonable alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe. A\n            broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative\n            design is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably\n            safe. The factors include, among others, the magnitude and probability of the\n            foreseeable risks of harm, the instructions and warnings accompanying the\n            product, and the nature and strength of consumer expectations regarding the\n            product, including expectations arising from product portrayal and marketing.\n            The relative advantages and disadvantages of the product as designed and as it\n            alternatively could have been designed may also be considered. 13\n\nThe Reporters' Note gives an example of how factors other than a safer alternative design affect\nthe determination whether a product is defective:\n\n            Comment f lists among the factors a court may consider in determining\n            whether an alternative design is reasonable and whether its omission renders\n            a product not reasonably safe the following: (1) magnitude and probability of\n            the foreseeable risks of harm; (2) the instructions and warnings accompanying\n            the product; and (3) the nature and strength of consumer expectations.

The\n            factfinder could consider the warnings on the bottle describing the danger of\n            exposing a user's skin to the cleaner in risk-utility balancing to decide whether\n            the product was unreasonably dangerous. 14\n\nHansen explained its rationale as follows:\n\n            We do not think that the risk to the consumer of the design of many household\n            products can be rationally evaluated without considering the product's warnings.\n            Thus, for example, what is the risk of the design of a power saw, or other power\n            tools or equipment, without considering the product's directions and warnings?\n            We dare say that the risk would be astronomically, and irrationally, high. The\n            same could be said about common garden pesticides, or even the household\n            microwave oven.

Such cans are not defective\nmerely because they could be redesigned so as not to explode if punctured or incinerated. A\nwarning against such misuse ought to be sufficient.\n\nThe Court protests that it has not disregarded the effect of warnings in determining whether the\npossibility of a safer alternative design makes a product defective but has merely left the matter to\nthe jury. But the question remains: can any product be shown not to be defective as a matter of law\nif a reasonable alternative design could have avoided plaintiff's injury? The Court suggests no such\npossibility. The Restatement appears to contemplate that a product is not defective as a matter of\nlaw if the safer design does not eliminate the risks, or if the warning on the product does not leave\na significant residuum of risk, as when “users of the product may not be adequately reached, may\nbe likely to be inattentive, or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the instructions or heed the\nwarnings.” 16 The present case illustrates this rule. Concededly, the evidence favorable to Martinez\nshows that the Goodrich tire's bead wire can be redesigned, mostly to increase its strength, without\nsignificantly reducing the tire's utility or increasing the danger of blowouts at highway speeds.\nSuch an alternative design is thus reasonable and safer. But it only reduces—it does not eliminate\n—the risk that a tire being mounted on a mismatched wheel will explode. The undisputed evidence\nin this case is that a 16” tire cannot be mounted on a 16.5” wheel, and that if the tire continues to be\ninflated in an effort to force it to seat on the wheel rim, it will explode. Redesigning the bead wire\nonly means that the tire will withstand higher inflation pressure before exploding. Although there\nwas evidence that the alternate design would prevent the tire from exploding at ordinary mounting\npressures, nothing about the design precludes the person mounting the tire from continuing to\nincrease the pressure in an effort to force it to seat on the rim. Because the risk of explosion cannot\nbe eliminated, omission of the alternative design may not make the tire not reasonably safe under\ncomment l of the Restatement.\n\nNor was Goodrich's warning ineffective, another factor under comment l. Goodrich's warning label\nshowed a picture of a person being injured by an exploding tire and stated in bright colors:\n\n\n\n                                                  DANGER\n\n   NEVER MOUNT A 16”\n\n      SIZE DIAMETER TIRE\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While it is possible to\n      pass a 16” diameter tire over the lip or flange of a 16.5” size diameter rim, it cannot position\n      itself against the rim flange. If an attempt is made to seat the bead by inflating the tire, the\n      tire bead will break with explosive force.\n\n      ...\n\n      NEVER inflate a tire which is lying on the floor or other flat surface. Always use a tire\n      mounting machine with a hold-down device or safety cage or bolt to vehicle axle.\n\n      NEVER inflate to seat beads without using an extension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck.\n\n      NEVER stand, lean or reach over the assembly during inflation.\n\n      ...\n\n      Failure to comply with these safety precautions can cause the bead to break and the assembly\n      to burst with sufficient force to cause serious injury or death.\n\n   Martinez does not question the adequacy of the warning. It cautions not only against\n   mismatching tires and wheels but against *348 inflating tires in certain ways under any\n   circumstances. The record in this case does not show that a warning against mismatching tires\n   and wheels will not reach users. On the contrary, Martinez testified that he saw the warning\n   on the tire, and anyway, he knew that it would be very dangerous to try to mount a 16” tire\n   on a 16.5” wheel. As Martinez put it, “common sense also tells you that where you have a\n   mismatch you can get injured.” Martinez was not inattentive, as the garbage truck worker who\n   lost his balance. He knew better than to lean over a tire—any tire—while inflating it. None of\n   the reasons in comment l that warnings may be ineffective apply in this case.\nNor were the warnings impractical. Despite the fact that Martinez was not provided with any of\nthe safety devices prescribed in the warning—a workable tire mounting machine, a cage, or an\nextension hose with gauge and clip-on chuck—and may not have been able to bolt the wheel back\non the trailer from which it had been removed before mounting the tire, he could have avoided\ninjury by simply not leaning over the tire while inflating it. Martinez testified as follows:\n\n   Q Now, I believe you have also testified, Roberto, that while you are inflating a tire you would\n   not want to be leaning over the tire as you inflate it.\n\n   A No.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Do you feel it would be a safety consideration, to be safer to not be over the tire—\n\n   A Yes.\n\n   Q —while you're inflating it?\n\n   A Yes.\n\nThe inboard side of the tire, next to the ground, exploded. Martinez was injured when the wheel\nstruck his head. The wheel also struck the roof of the shop overhead and dented it. Clearly, had\nMartinez not been leaning over the wheel, as he knew not to do and as the tire label warned against,\nthe tire would not have struck his head.\n\nGiven the ease with which injury can be avoided, there is no evidence that redesigning the bead\nwire will eliminate a “significant residuum of risk” in the tire as designed with the warning label.\nIn fact, Martinez's own evidence is to the contrary. The record establishes that there has been only\none other claimed injury caused by attempting to mount a 16” tire with a warning label on a 16.5”\nwheel. The record does not reflect whether that claim was ever proved. Thousands of 16” tires\nhave been manufactured with warning labels; millions of 16.5” wheels have been manufactured\nwithout warning labels. Martinez's evidence (which should not have been admitted) shows thirty-\nfour claims against Goodrich for injuries caused by mismatching unlabeled 16” tires on 16.5”\nwheels. There has been one other claim involving a labeled tire. The tire industry should not be\ncompelled to redesign bead wires to make tires harder to explode—or pay damages for failing to\ndo so—simply because one or perhaps two mechanics over the years failed to follow directions\nor their own good sense.\n\n            From a fairness perspective, requiring individual users and consumers to bear\n            appropriate responsibility for proper product use prevents careless users and\n            consumers from being subsidized by more careful users and consumers, when\n            the former are paid damages out of funds to which the latter are forced to\n            contribute through higher product prices. 17\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The risk of explosion could not be eliminated, the warning was\nclear, effective, and easy to follow, and thus no significant residuum of risk remained in the tire\nas designed with the warning label attached. In the Court's view, a product manufacturer *349\nmay be liable for failing to make any feasible design change that does not significantly impair a\nproduct's utility, if only to prevent rare mishaps from conscious disregard of adequate warnings.\nThat is all the evidence in this case shows. The Court appropriately rejects one extreme position\n—comment j to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts—but then adopts the opposite\nand equally extreme position. In so doing, the Court swings toward strict liability.\n\n\n\n                                                         II\n\nThe evidence is undisputed that the wheel was defectively designed, and that the defect helped\ncause the accident. Martinez's expert testified:\n\n   Q And in your opinion the Budd wheel, Exhibit 2, is defective.\n\n   A Yes, sir.\n\n   Q And it was a cause of the accident.\n\n   A Yes, one of the causes.\n\nMartinez's expert explained that a 16.5” wheel can be designed to prevent mounting a 16” tire,\nbut that the tire cannot be designed to prevent attempts to mount it on the wheel. Moreover, the\nexpert explained that stamping the size on the wheel in plain sight, as some wheel manufacturers\ndo, would reduce the risk of mismatching. Martinez acknowledged that it “makes sense” that the\nsize of the wheel be stamped on the outboard side near the valve stem where it can easily be seen.\nMartinez's co-worker also testified:\n\n   Q If when you were working with this wheel you had seen the number 16.5 you wouldn't have\n   proceeded, would you?\n\n   A No, sir.\n\n   Q You knew based on your experience that you do not mix different sizes?\n\n   A No.\n\n   Q That's something every mechanic knows?\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rather, the size was\nincluded in a string of numbers stamped on the inboard side of the tire that were hard to find and\nharder to decipher. The wheel Martinez was working on was so covered by caliche that it would\nhave been virtually impossible to find the tire size.\n\nGoodrich argues that the evidence conclusively establishes that the wheel rim was defectively\ndesigned and that the defective design was a cause of Martinez's injuries. The Court rejects this\nargument, using the rule that “opinion testimony, even when uncontroverted, does not bind the jury\nunless the subject matter is one for experts alone”. 18 The Court concedes that “expert testimony\nwas probably necessary to show the feasibility of the alternative rim design which would have\nprevented a mismatched tire from passing over the rim flange.” 19 Thus, in the Court's view,\nwith which I agree, the evidence establishes one component of defective design—the possibility\nof a safer, reasonable alternative rim design. 20 The second component—that the rim was not\nreasonably safe without the alternative design 21 —is not in this context, according to the Court, a\nmatter for experts alone. Thus, the Court concludes, the evidence does not conclusively establish\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed. But the Court's conclusion does not follow from its\npremise. That is, even if the jury was free to disregard expert testimony that the wheel rim was\nunreasonably dangerous as designed, including the testimony on Martinez's own expert, because\nthe subject was not one for experts alone, the *350 matter may nevertheless be conclusively\nestablished by the evidence.\n\nAs a general rule, the testimony of a party or a witness who has an interest in the outcome of a\nsuit cannot conclusively establish a matter but raises an issue of credibility on which the jury must\npass. 22 But there are exceptions. Even summary judgment can be granted on “uncontroverted\ntestimonial evidence of an interested witness ... if the evidence is clear, positive and direct,\notherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily\ncontroverted.” 23 As we explained in Collora v. Navarro:\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                36\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

Rather, it is flexible\n   and its application must turn on the facts of each case. Certainly there will be cases where\n   the credibility of an interested witness or party is so suspect that it must go to the jury, even\n   though the testimony is uncontradicted. Then there will also be cases where the testimony of the\n   witness is so clear that the jury should not be allowed to speculate as to his veracity. Between\n   these two extremes lies a broad spectrum of possibilities. Our courts have recognized this in the\n   past by setting forth certain standards by which the rule and its exceptions are to be measured:\n   Is the testimony clear, direct, and positive? Is it internally consistent? Is it contradicted or\n   corroborated by other witnesses? Does the opposing party possess the means to verify or dispute\n   the testimony? Does he have a way to test the witness' credibility? Obviously no one factor\n   automatically can be dispositive in every case. 24\nCollora was a suit for partition of real property in which plaintiff claimed an interest as defendant's\ncommon law wife. Plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had agreed to be husband and wife\n—one of the elements of a common law marriage—and the evidence conclusively established the\nother elements. Defendant did not testify or offer evidence in rebuttal. The trial court directed a\nverdict for the plaintiff, based on her uncontradicted testimony. The court of civil appeals reversed,\nholding that the plaintiff's testimony did not conclusively establish the existence of an agreement\nto be husband and wife because the jury could have chosen not to believe her, and thus reasonable\nminds could differ over the conclusions to be drawn from her testimony. 25 This Court reversed\nthe court of civil appeals, holding that the directed verdict was proper.\n\nThe testimony of Martinez and his co-worker, as well as Martinez's expert witness, that the\nwheel rim was unreasonably dangerous was contrary to Martinez's interest in the case. It was\nto Martinez's benefit that the percentage responsibility for causing his injuries assigned to the\nwheel manufacturers be as low as possible, since he had already settled with them. Testimony\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed undercut Martinez's position that Goodrich alone was\nresponsible. Because there was nothing to cast suspicion on Martinez's testimony or that of his co-\nworker and his expert witness concerning whether the wheel rim was unreasonably dangerous as\ndesigned, the jury was bound by that testimony. Their testimony, contrary to Martinez's interest,\nwas more like testimony by a disinterested witness. Professors William Powers, Jr. and Jack Ratliff\nhave explained the considerations for determining whether a disinterested witness's testimony is\nbinding on the jury:\n\n            Must the jury accept [the uncontradicted testimony by a disinterested witness]?\n            That is, does such testimony, if uncontradicted, [conclusively establish a fact]?\n            The prevailing and better view is that the reasonable minds test should apply\n            here. If there is nothing to cast suspicion on the testimony—that is, if reasonable\n            minds could not differ—then the jury must accept *351 it. But, if the testimony\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  37\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

McDonald aptly observes that disinterested testimony is, in\n            fact, treated much the same as interested testimony, except that courts are more\n            inclined in the case of interested testimony to find suspicious circumstances that\n            would allow the jury to reject it. 26\n\nEven without the testimony of Martinez, his co-worker, and his expert, the record establishes\nthat the wheel rim was defectively designed. As already noted, the factors to be considered in\ndetermining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous include the magnitude and probability\nof the foreseeable risks of harm, the instructions and warnings accompanying the product, the\nnature and strength of consumer expectations regarding the product, and the relative advantages\nand disadvantages of the product as designed and as it alternatively could have been designed. 27\nConcerning these factors: the risk of injury from mismounting a tire was the same for the\ndefectively designed wheel rim as for the defectively designed tire; the wheel bore no warnings, as\nthe tire did; consumer expectations were no different for the wheel than for the tire; and there was\nno evidence that the wheel rim design was advantageous or the alternate design disadvantageous.\nIn sum, the evidence established that the tire was less dangerous than the wheel rim, because the\ntire at least had a warning label and the wheel had none.\n\nThe Court states that Martinez's expert's testimony that the wheel was defective was not evidence\nthat it was unreasonably dangerous. But the expert was directed by Martinez's counsel to assume\nthat “defect is defined by the Court as being unreasonably dangerous.” The Court states that the\nexpert's opinion was not conclusive, given the factors the jury was to balance. But the only factors\nthe jury was instructed in the charge to consider were “the utility of the product and the risk\ninvolved in its use.” Moreover, Martinez's expert testified that the defect in the wheel could have\nbeen remedied simply and without difficulty. Specifically, the expert testified as follows:\n\n   Q From the moment it came on the market the 16–1/2–inch rim could have been changed so\n   that you couldn't get the wrong sized tire on it.\n\n   A I believe it could, yes.\n\n   Q The same thing is not true for the 16–inch tire. There is no way to design or alter the 16–\n   inch tire so that somebody by mistake doesn't try to put it on a 16–1/2–inch wheel. That is true;\n   isn't it?\n\n   A I don't know of a way to do it, no. I have not seen a way to do that.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Goodrich complains that Martinez never laid a predicate for admitting this evidence,\nshowing the similarity of the other lawsuits to this one. The Court dismisses Goodrich's complaint\nin a sentence: “The absence of pictographic warnings on the tires does not render the accidents so\ndissimilar as to preclude their admission, but merely goes to the weight of the evidence.” 28\n\nThe Court has not met the substance of Goodrich's argument. First, Goodrich argues that Martinez\nlaid no predicate whatever for admission of the evidence. Martinez does not, and cannot, dispute\nthis. The district court admitted the list of lawsuits based solely on the statement of Martinez's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The interrogatory and answer were never offered in evidence (and are not in our record),\nnor was there any other proof to show the nature of the cases listed. A plaintiff who offers evidence\nof other accidents is “required to show that the earlier accidents occurred under reasonably similar\nbut not necessarily identical circumstances.” 29 Martinez made no showing *353 whatever. Thus,\nthe Court holds that evidence of other claims may be admitted with no more predicate than\ncounsel's argument that the claims are similar to the case in which they are offered. This, of course,\neviscerates any meaningful evidentiary standard.\n\nSecond, although Goodrich argued that the presence or absence of pictographic labels was a\nsignificant difference in claims of injury due to mismatch tires, that was not the only difference\nGoodrich claimed was significant. Other differences in the cases, according to Goodrich's counsel,\nwere how experienced the injured person was in changing tires, what safety equipment was\navailable, what kind of tire was involved and whether it was radial or bias ply, and what the result\nwas in the case. At least two of the cases were dismissed against Goodrich. The burden was not\non Goodrich to show that the other cases were different; the burden was on Martinez to show that\nthey were similar. 30 Nevertheless, Goodrich pointed out important differences to the court.\n\nThird, the presence of pictographic labels may have been a significant distinction in the cases. Of\nthe thirty-four on the list Martinez offered, only two involved pictographic labels. It may be that\nfewer accidents involved labeled tires because the labels were effective, or because fewer tires\nwere manufactured with labels, or because labels had been used for only a short time, or perhaps\nfor other reasons. Such arguments would go merely to the weight to be given the evidence, not\nits admissibility. But without any predicate at all offered by Martinez, it is impossible to say that\nthe presence of the label was not significant.\n\nFinally, admission of the list was extremely prejudicial to Goodrich. Martinez's counsel told the\ncourt before trial that “[i]n all these cases we keep talking about ... they keep killing and injuring\npeople”. Martinez's counsel asked his own expert witness: “And some tire companies it only\ntakes twenty-nine or thirty people to get killed or injured before they come to the conclusion\nthat maybe they ought to change their bead.” Martinez's counsel asked Goodrich's expert: “So\nhow many people have you all killed?” Without any predicate whatever, Martinez's counsel was\npermitted to use the list of lawsuits to insinuate repeatedly that others had been injured or killed\nin circumstances similar to those in this case. This was plainly error.\n\nThe lawsuit list was not the only exhibit erroneously admitted. The district court also admitted a\nchart sponsored by Martinez's expert witness showing the history of changes in bead wire design.\nThe Court's conclusion that “all the evidence contained on the chart was already in evidence” 31 is\nsimply false. There is absolutely no evidence of the very prejudicial reference on this time-line to\n“numerous 16/16.5 mismatch explosions resulting in serious injury or death.” It should go without\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Malone that evidence\nof anticipated or unpaid punitive damage claims is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible to show\npunitive damage liability. 32 If anticipated or unpaid punitive damage claims are not probative of\npunitive damage liability absent evidence of whether such claims have succeeded, I fail to see\nhow actual damage claims are probative of liability for actual damages absent the same evidence.\nToday's holding that evidence of other claims—whether proven or not, and whether similar or\nnot—is relevant and admissible to show liability directly conflicts with our decision in Owens–\nCorning and essentially destroys any standard for admitting evidence of other claims.\n\n\n\n                                                        IV\n\nThe Court holds that the district court erred in denying Goodrich's motion to bifurcate *354 the\nactual and punitive damages phases of the trial, but that the error was harmless because Martinez\noffered no evidence of Goodrich's net worth and the evidence of other lawsuits against Goodrich\nwas properly admitted. I have already shown that the list of lawsuits should not have been admitted\nwithout a predicate showing of similarity between each of the lawsuits and this case. But even if\nthe list of other lawsuits was properly admitted, it alone required a bifurcation of the actual and\npunitive damage claims.\n\nAs the Court notes, “[i]n [Transportation Insurance Co. v.] Moriel we held that ‘a trial court,\nif presented with a timely motion, should bifurcate the determination of the amount of punitive\ndamages from the remaining issues.” 33 Although we reasoned in Moriel that evidence of a\ndefendant's net worth offered on a punitive damage claim could unfairly prejudice a defendant\non plaintiff's claim for actual damages, we did not suggest that net worth evidence was the only\nprejudice in trying actual and punitive damage claims together. In the present case, Martinez's\ncounsel's repeated references to other claims against Goodrich were plainly intended to insinuate\nthat if others had been injured trying to mount Goodrich's 16” tires on 16.5” wheels, the tire was\ndefective, and the defect caused Martinez's injuries. The list of other lawsuits, even if properly\nadmitted, unfairly prejudiced Goodrich on Martinez's liability claim as much as evidence of its\nnet worth would have.\n\nThe district court refused Goodrich's motion to bifurcate the trial before evidence was offered and\nwithout regard to whether Martinez would offer evidence of net worth. The record shows that the\ndistrict court refused to follow Moriel because Martinez did not want a bifurcated trial. The court's\nerror clearly prejudiced Goodrich.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                42\n\fUniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

At the pretrial hearing on this issue, the\n        Martinezes' counsel informed the court that Goodrich had identified these accidents in response to an interrogatory asking, “How many\n        people do you acknowledge have been injured as a result of mounting or attempting to mount 16 inch diameter tires manufactured\n        by you on a 16.5 inch diameter rim?” While the interrogatory itself may not be in our record, the Martinezes' counsel read it into the\n        record at the pretrial hearing, and no one disputes its wording or that Goodrich identified the thirty-four accidents in response to it.\n        Thus, the Martinezes established that each of the other accidents involved an injury resulting from mounting a 16” Goodrich tire on\n        a 16.5” rim. Further, it was undisputed that each of the other accidents involved a tape bead like that involved in this accident. Under\n        these circumstances, there was an adequate predicate on which to admit the other accidents.\n8       We thus need not address the court of appeals' conclusion that Goodrich failed to properly preserve this complaint.

SCM (more commonly known as Smith-Corona) was engaged\nin the business of selling and repairing business machines; however, that company decided to close\nits factory service station in Houston and turn the servicing over to an authorized representative,\nwho would make repairs on SCM's behalf and then bill SCM. SCM selected Brewington, a local\ntypewriter company, as its representative and stipulated that Brewington move into its premises.\nSCM wanted the repair station to stay at that location because customers were familiar with it and\nbecause certain literature and the machines themselves contained that service address and phone\nnumber.\n\nSCM appears to have copied the Brewington sublease from the Sabel sublease. Indeed, paragraph\n8 of the Brewington sublease is identical to paragraph 9 of the Sabel sublease, which states that\n“Tenant shall be entitled to use the Demised Premises *901 for the service and repair and sales\nof televisions and other related electronic equipment.” Brewington sells and repairs typewriters\nand computer printers, but not televisions and other related electronic equipment. The Brewington\nsublease also was made subject to the master lease, and parking (paragraph 19) was provided for\nin language identical to that in the Sabel sublease.\n\nOn August 1, 1984, with SCM's consent, Brewington subleased 2,700 square feet of its lease space\nto Amstar Satellite Systems, Inc. Once again, the Sabel sublease appears to have been used as\nthe model for this new sublease, though the “use” paragraph (paragraph 8) was changed to reflect\nAmstar's actual business. The parking paragraph (paragraph 19) once again remained unchanged.\n\nOn December 25, 1984, Jack G. Jones, Trustee, conveyed all of the property and the Hillcroft\nbuilding to United Interests, Inc., Trustee, which purchased the property as trustee for a partnership\nconsisting of United Interests, Inc. and others. One month later, SCM assigned all of its rights as\nlessee under the master lease to United Interests.\n\nUnited Interests notified Brewington of the SCM assignment by letter of February 7, 1985, and\nalso advised that a physical inspection of the premises was in progress. On February 20th, United\nInterests wrote Brewington that the inspection was complete, enclosed a copy of the repair bid\nand requested from Brewington a proportionate share (50% or $27,560.00) of the repair expenses.\nThereafter, on March 18th, United Interests informed Brewington that, due to the latter's failure\nto contribute its share of the repair expenses or to make arrangements for the repairs, United\nInterests was giving formal notice of default under the Brewington sublease and reserved the right\nto terminate the sublease unless Brewington contributed to or arranged for repairs within thirty\ndays.\n\nThere was no further communication until July 11, 1985, when United Interests' attorney wrote\nBrewington that property immediately to the south of the building had been leased to CSI Collision\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(d/b/a CSI Used Cars). The letter advised Brewington that this property included a\nportion of the parking area south of the building and that parking on the south side by Brewington's\nemployees and customers would not be permitted. Almost immediately, Brewington filed suit for\nan injunction and a declaration of its rights under its sublease. United Interests counterclaimed for\na declaration of its rights under the leases in question. CSI filed a related action for injunctive relief\nand damages against Brewington, and the causes of action were consolidated for trial. Following\nthe trial, the court entered judgment for Brewington and filed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law. CSI is not a party to this appeal.\n\nIn points of error one through four, United Interests asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of\nlaw in finding ambiguity in the Brewington sublease; in allowing the admission of parol evidence\nto vary its terms; in allowing the admission of hearsay evidence to explain its terms; and in\nreforming the terms of the sublease.\n\n [1] [2] In Conclusion of Law No. II, the trial court concluded that paragraphs 8 (use) and 19\n(parking) of the sublease between SCM and Brewington were ambiguous. We agree. The question\nof whether a contract is ambiguous is one of law for the court. R & P Enterprises v. LaGuarta,\nGavrel & Kirk, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1509173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1509173/r-p-enterprises-v-laguarta-gavrel-kirk-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (Tex.1980). When interpreting a contract, a court's\nprimary concern is to ascertain and to give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the\ninstrument. To do so, the court must examine and consider the entire instrument so that none of its\nprovisions will be rendered meaningless. A contract is ambiguous only when the application of the\npertinent rules of interpretation leaves it genuinely uncertain which one of two or more meanings\nis the proper one. If a contract is determined to be ambiguous, then extrinsic evidence is *902\nadmissible to discover its true meaning. Id. at 518–19. With these precepts in mind, we examine\nthe sublease in question.\n\n [3] Paragraph 19 concerning parking is ambiguous in and of itself. Neither “general parking” nor\n“general parking area” is defined. The term “general parking” implies that there is also some other\nkind of parking. “General parking area” equates with the entire parking lot, and the paragraph\ncould be interpreted as requiring that employees and customers park in the front of or on the north\nside of both the north and south parking areas. Finally, the paragraph does not read “in the front\nand on the north side of the building ”, which would more readily comport with United Interests'\ndesired interpretation.\n\n [4] The ambiguity is compounded when paragraph 19 is considered with the rest of the sublease,\nparticularly paragraph 15, which concerns remodeling of the premises. Brewington agreed to\naccept the premises “as is” “excepting repairs of parking lot and facade made at SCM's expense” (a\nphrase interlineated by Brewington's president). The paragraph did not address whether repairs\nwere to be restricted to a certain part of the parking lot. Indeed, trial testimony confirmed that\nrepairs were made to both the north and south parking areas and paid for by SCM. Brewington's\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This renders even more ambiguous a lease term that would then restrict\nthe use of that lot.\n\n [5] The trial court found that the interlineation of paragraph 15 and the general ambiguity of\nparagraph 19 allowed parol evidence of Brewington's need for, as well as prior use of, the south\nparking lot. Again, we agree. Preston Whitfill was a service manager for SCM at the Hillcroft\nlocation. When Brewington contracted to do SCM's warranty work in the Houston area and moved\ninto SCM's leased space, Whitfill went to work for Brewington. He, therefore, was in a position to\nknow what transpired during the tenures of both companies. Whitfill testified that SCM employees\nhad parked on the south side of the building and that Brewington's employees continued to do so\nafter the move. He further testified that deliveries to both companies were made to the back door\non the south side of the building because the service department was located there and because\ndelivery through the front of the building was difficult due to a narrow hallway and several sharp\nturns.\n\nJohnny Johnson, Brewington's president, testified that the company utilizes the south lot in its\nday-to-day business. It is where employees and customers park, deliveries are received and sent\nand the trash dumpster is located. Were the south lot not available for Brewington's use, business\nwould be adversely affected.\n\nBoth Lee Sabel, owner of Sabel's T.V. Service, Inc., which subleased from SCM, and Charles\nHarvey, owner of Amstar Satellite Systems, Inc., which subleased from Brewington, testified that\nBrewington's employees generally park in the south lot. Furthermore, the men stated that their\nemployees also had used the south lot when the north and front lots were full (with Whitfill's and,\nlater, Brewington's permission).\n\n [6] [7] United Interests next complains of the admission of hearsay evidence to explain the terms\nof the SCM-Brewington sublease. This complaint appears to center on Preston Whitfill's testimony\nconcerning his conversations about the parking lot with certain SCM representatives, particularly\nSandy Swartzberg, a regional service manager. In a trial before the court, the presumption is that\nthe court did not consider hearsay. Landscape Design and Construction, Inc. v.

Further,\nany error in its admission is harmless because there was sufficient evidence, without the hearsay,\nto resolve the ambiguity. Id. We refer to the above-cited *903 testimony regarding Brewington's\nneed for and prior use of the south parking lot, as well as Johnny Johnson's testimony that he\nunderstood the lease area to include that lot.\n\n [8] Finally, United Interests' argument that the trial court erred in reforming the terms of the\nsublease is without merit.

We agree.\n\n [9] [10] [11] A mutual mistake of fact occurs when both parties to a transaction have a belief\nin the present existence of a thing, material to the transaction, that does not exist. Such would\nbe the case where the parties to a contract have a common intention, but the written contract\nerroneously reflects that intention because of a mistake by both parties in writing the agreement.\nTurberville v.

Parol evidence is admissible to show that the writing, because of the mistake,\nincorrectly reflects the true agreement, and the equitable remedy of reformation is available to\ncorrect the mistake. However, the party claiming relief must show what the parties' true agreement\nwas and that the instrument incorrectly reflects that agreement because of a mutual mistake. Estes\nv.

They are identical in format and vary only in certain provisions specific to each\ncompany, such as rent and term of lease. This would explain the fact that the use paragraphs (9\nin Sabel and 8 in Brewington) are exactly the same, regardless of the fact that Brewington sells\nand repairs typewriters rather than “televisions and other related electronic equipment” (Sabel's\nbusiness). Clearly, the use paragraph was overlooked in the revision process, and this lends\ncredence to Brewington's argument that the parking paragraph also was overlooked. The trial\ncourt thus properly admitted parol evidence to show that the lease incorrectly reflected the true\nagreement of the parties.\n\nJohnny Johnson testified that when SCM stipulated that Brewington take over SCM's lease area\nas part of their arrangement, he understood that area to include the south parking lot. No one\never indicated to him that SCM would retain the right to lease that lot to a third party. He also\nunderstood that the only limitation in paragraph 19 on Brewington's use of the parking lot was that\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Johnson further testified that when he interlineated\nthe language in paragraph 15 about repairs to the lot, he was referring to the south lot.\n\nTaken in the context of the evidence concerning SCM and Brewington's prior use of the south lot,\nthe repairs to it and the need for access to that lot, Johnson's testimony tends to establish what the\nparties' true agreement was. In addition, there is Preston Whitfill's testimony that as a principal\n *904 SCM employee during the period of negotiations between SCM and Brewington, he was\nnever notified that the south parking lot was to be excluded from the lease area. Furthermore, he\nremembered discussing the repairs of that lot with Sandy Swartzberg, who agreed to do the repairs\nfor Brewington at SCM's expense. Whitfill also testified that after the dispute over the parking\nlot arose between Brewington and United Interests, he called Swartzberg, who told him United\nInterests did not have the right to lease out the south parking area because that was part of the\nBrewington property.\n\nTurning to the evidence that the sublease incorrectly reflects the agreement between SCM and\nBrewington because of a mutual mistake by both parties, we reiterate that the Brewington\nsublease clearly was copied from the Sabel sublease and, in the process, several paragraphs were\noverlooked. During trial Lee Sabel verified that the Sabel sublease provided for parking on the\nnorth side for his approximately thirty employees. Both Whitfill and Johnson testified that the\nBrewington sublease was prepared by the SCM legal department in New York City rather than in\nHouston. Whitfill also testified that Janice Smith in that department had acknowledged that the\nBrewington sublease was Sabel's sublease (with the implication that the allotted parking space\nwas also Sabel's).\n\nJohnny Johnson had an opportunity to review and change the parking paragraph in the sublease\nduring both the original negotiations and the later leasing of space to Amstar and did not do so.\nAppellant argues this indicates that parking was not a material term of the sublease. However, the\ntestimony regarding Brewington's utilization of the south lot in its day-to-day business disputes\nthat assumption. It is equally possible that use of the south lot was so material to the agreement\nthat both parties assumed it had been properly resolved. Indeed, when asked if it were possible\nthat SCM planned to lease the lot to a third party, Preston Whitfill responded, “Wouldn't make\nsense gaining money off of one side they would be taking it from the other because they would\nbe screwing up the guarantee station.”\n\n [13] United Interests also objects to the admission of hearsay evidence to show the mutuality of\nthe mistake. Again, we note that in a bench trial, the presumption is that the court did not consider\nhearsay, and any error in its admission is harmless as there was sufficient evidence without it to\nshow mutual mistake.

Estes, 462 S.W.2d at 275. In this case, however, the court simply filed\nconclusions of law stating both the intent of paragraph 8 and the most reasonable interpretation\nof paragraph 19 and then, in its judgment, permanently enjoined United Interests from interfering\nwith Brewington's use of the south parking lot incidental to its rights under its sublease. Points of\nerror five through eight are overruled.\n\n [16] In points of error nine and ten, United Interests maintains that the court erred in declaring\nthat the right to exclusive use and occupancy or the right to use any part of the south parking lot\nwas and is incidental and necessary to Brewington's business and the effectuation of the intent of\nthe sublease. In points eleven and twelve, United Interests argues that the court erred in declaring\nthat Brewington has a right under the sublease to the exclusive use and occupancy of any portion\nof that lot. Point of error thirteen states that the court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction\nagainst United Interests.\n\nAs noted above, in its judgment the trial court permanently enjoined United Interests from\ninterfering with Brewington's use of the south parking lot incidental to its rights under its lease.\nNowhere did the *905 court declare that Brewington has the right to exclusive use and occupancy\nof the lot. Neither did the court declare that use of the lot is incidental and necessary to Brewington's\nbusiness, though in its closing statements, the court made clear this was a key reason for ruling as\nit did. As previously discussed, the evidence supported this determination. Brewington is located\non the south side of the building and access to the business by employees, customers and delivery\npersons is enhanced by access to the south parking lot, particularly as the service department is\nlocated at the back end of the south side. Furthermore, there are too few spaces in the front and\nnorth lots to accommodate all of the building's tenants and their customers, as evidenced by Lee\nSabel's testimony that when the north lot was full, his employees parked in the south lot.\n\nThe trial court's judgment did not declare Brewington's rights under the sublease but rather upheld\nBrewington's rights under the sublease to use the lot. In its Conclusion of Law No. IV, the court\ninterpreted those rights as including primary parking in the south lot, without limitation to use any\nof the parking areas on the leased premises, subject to the sole limitation that no tenant has the\nright to specifically reserve assigned parking places. Once the court found ambiguity and mutual\nmistake in the lease, it was then entitled to interpret it. City of Pinehurst, 432 S.W.2d at 519; Estes,\n462 S.W.2d at 275.\n\nFinally, United Interests' point of error that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the\ninjunction is without merit.

Denying the losing party's requested\nrelief is not an abuse of that discretion. Further, in its argument, United Interests states, “The\nquestion of United Interests' rights may best be addressed through a determination of Brewington's\nrights under its sublease with respect to the use of the South parking lot.” In effect, this is what\nthe trial court has done. By decreeing that Brewington has the right to use the south parking lot\nwithout interference, the court necessarily implies that United Interests does not have the right to\ninterfere with that use. Yet, the sublease continues in full force and effect as to the other landlord/\ntenant rights. The fourteenth point of error is overruled.\n\n [19] In point of error fifteen, United Interests complains that the trial court erred in declaring\nthat the acts of United Interests constituted an attempted constructive eviction of Brewington and\nthat those acts provided a legal basis to enjoin United Interests from pursuing its rights under the\nsublease. In his bench statements, the trial judge stated that the attempt to restrict Brewington's use\nof the south parking lot was tantamount to constructive eviction. There is evidence in the record\nthat United Interests planned to re-develop this property and had discussed with its tenants the\npossibility of moving them. This evidence, coupled with the acts of United Interests in assessing\nexcessive maintenance charges against Brewington, in declaring Brewington in default of its lease\nagreement and in leasing the south parking lot to CSI, supports the trial court's conclusion. Whether\nthat conclusion may have provided the court with a legal basis for the injunction is immaterial. In\nactuality the court found that under the sublease Brewington had the right to use the south parking\nlot without interference and properly enjoined United Interests from so interfering. Point of error\nfifteen is overruled.\n\nIn point of error sixteen United Interests complains of the trial court's award of attorney's *906\nfees on appeal. In a cross-point Brewington attacks the trial court's failure to award it attorney's\nfees for legal services through the trial court. Brewington presented evidence of more than $26,000\nin attorney's fees through the trial court, $2,500 for appeal through the court of appeals, and $1,000\nfor appeal to the supreme court. United Interests presented evidence of its attorney's fees in excess\nof $30,000 through the trial court, $3,000 for appeal through the court of appeals, and $2,000 for\nappeal to the supreme court.\n\nThe court awarded neither party attorney's fees through the trial court; however, it did award\nBrewington $10,000 should United Interests appeal to the court of appeals and Brewington prevail,\nand an additional $5,000 should United Interests apply for a writ of error and Brewington again\nprevail.

Brewington charges the court with an abuse of discretion in\nfailing to award it attorney's fees for legal services through the trial court.\n\n [20] [21] Regarding the cross-point, Brewington argues that given the evidence of United\nInterests' bad faith, an award of attorney's fees for trial was justified. The award of attorney's fees\nin a declaratory judgment action is discretionary. Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.009 (Vernon\n1986) (formerly Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2524–1 § 10 (Vernon 1965)). In supplemental findings\nof fact the court stated that it found no sufficient cause to justify the award of attorney's fees to\neither party for the trial phase. It is clear from this finding and from bench statements that the court\nrecognized both parties had legitimate rights to pursue and, therefore, each should bear its own\nattorney's fees through the trial court. Given the facts of this case, this was not an unreasonable\naction by the trial court. Therefore, Brewington's cross-point is overruled.\n\n [22] Next we consider the trial court's award to Brewington of attorney's fees on appeal. Under\nthe record before us we cannot understand how there could be sufficient cause to justify the award\nof attorney's fees on appeal, there being no sufficient cause to justify the award of such fees\nthrough the trial court. On this record and in light of the trial court's finding regarding attorney's\nfees through the trial court, we hold the trial court erred and abused its discretion in awarding to\nBrewington any attorney's fees on appeal.\n\nUnited Interests' points of error seventeen, eighteen and nineteen concern the trial court's failure\nto declare the rights of the parties under the master lease after declaring that obligations for repair\nand maintenance were to be controlled in the future by that lease; the failure to declare the parties'\nobligations for repair and maintenance under the Brewington sublease as they existed prior to final\njudgment; and the court's error in declaring the parties' rights and Brewington's obligations under\nits sublease in such a manner that the controversy was not ended and indeed created piecemeal\nlitigation.\n\n [23] [24] [25] A trial court may grant a declaratory judgment where it would serve a useful,\nbeneficial purpose.

To declare rights and obligations under the lease anticipates a conflict which may\nwell be resolved by the court's action regarding the use of the south parking lot.

The trial court indicated that the\nsummary judgment would be granted but wanted to resolve the matter of attorney fees before\nsigning the final judgment. Prior to the hearing on attorney fees, appellants filed a motion to\nstrike appellees' counterclaim for declaratory relief and for attorney fees under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act. At the hearing, the trial court overruled appellants' motion to strike. Appellees\nnon-suited their claim for attorney fees after appellants requested a jury for the determination of\nattorney fees.\n\nOn August 17, 1988, the trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of appellees. The\nsummary judgment declared that the non-executives had no right, title or interest in either the\noverriding royalties assigned to Johnie Lorene Acker and her husband, Edwin V.

Murphy, the other partition deeds were all executed in October,\n1948, by the same five children. One of the partition deeds awarded and set apart to Edna Mae\nJones certain lands in McMullen County, Texas. One of the partition deeds awarded to Julia\nAuthelia Akers (now Julia Authelia Winslow) certain lands upon which she and her husband were\nthen living in LaSalle County, Texas. One of the partition deeds awarded and set apart to Emmett\nGranvel Murphy certain lands in McMullen and Duval Counties, Texas. Each of the four partition\ndeeds contained identical provisions.\n\nMabel Mullin Snowden, one of the children of J.E. Murphy, had acquired a tract of land prior to\nhis death. These lands were situated in LaSalle and Dimmit Counties, Texas, conveyed to her by\ndeed on September 28, 1945, and recorded in the deed records of LaSalle County, Texas. This\nconveyance to Mabel M. Snowden included the oil, gas and mineral estate in the lands therein\ndescribed. Following the death of her father and by deed dated October 27, 1948, Mabel M.\nSnowden conveyed to her sisters, Edna Mae Jones, Johnie Lorene Acker, Julia Authelia Akers\nand *325 her brother, Emmett Granvel Murphy, in equal shares, an undivided four-fifths ( 4 /5)\ninterest in and to all the oil, gas and minerals acquired by her by such deed (the “Snowden Deed”)\nof September 28, 1945. Edna Mae Jones, Johnie Lorene Acker, Mabel Mullin Snowden, Julia\nAuthelia Akers and Virginia Gertrude Akers Murphy (the surviving wife of Emmett Granvel\nMurphy) entered into a Declaration and Agreement, dated December 9, 1953, and recorded it in\nthe deed records of LaSalle County, Texas. This deed confirmed the parties' intentions with respect\nto the rights of the surface owner and the sharing of any royalties by the surface owner.\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker executed four oil and gas leases, each conveying a portion of the lands\nawarded and set apart to her in the partition deed to her, each lease being to Murphy H. Baxter,\nas lessee. Murphy H. Baxter assigned to Johnie Lorene Acker and her husband, Edwin V. Acker,\nSr., a five and one-half percent (5½%) overriding royalty in and to the four leases by assignment\ndated March 24, 1981, and recorded in the deed records of McMullen County, Texas.\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker died April 8, 1983, and her interest in the overriding royalty passed to her\nsons, Edwin V. Acker, Jr. and Emmett A. Acker, as independent co-executors and trustees under\nher will. Edwin V. Acker, Sr., died November 4, 1987, and Edwin V. Acker, Jr. and Emmett A.\nAcker were appointed independent co-executors of his estate and have been substituted as legal\nrepresentatives of Edwin V. Acker, Sr., in his stead in this cause.\n\nIn their first point of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding that the terms\n“base one-eighth royalty” in the four partition deeds; “basic one-eighth royalty,” in the Declaration\nand Agreement and “above the one-eighth royalty” in the Snowden Deed, should be construed\ntogether and interpreted as limiting the non-executives' mineral interest to only four-fifths ( 4 /5)\nof a one-eighth (#) royalty.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

First,\nappellants allege that a question of fact exists due to an ambiguity relating to the terms “base one-\neighth royalty,” and “basic one-eighth royalty” in the Acker Partition Deed. Second, appellants\nassert that the Snowden Deed is subject to the ambiguous language contained in the Acker Partition\nDeed, thereby raising a fact question as to the construction of the Snowden Deed. We disagree with\nappellants' initial contention that the Acker Partition Deed is ambiguous. Therefore, appellants'\nargument concerning the application of the Acker Partition Deed to the Snowden Deed is moot.\n\n[1] In considering appellants' argument concerning an alleged ambiguous term, we must first\ndetermine whether the document is in fact ambiguous. If we so conclude, then extrinsic evidence\nmay be considered to determine the intent of the parties. Generally, construction of an ambiguous\ndocument presents a question of fact, and summary judgment would, therefore, be improper.\nHowever, undisputed parol evidence may resolve the ambiguity as a matter of law.

Appellants then claim that the legal\ninterpretation of the reservation yields a different result than that reached by the trial court. Finally,\nappellants conclude that the trial court's construction of the Acker Partition Deed has the effect of\nrendering meaningless the broad mineral interest in the first part of the reservation clause.\n\nThe first portion of the deed declares that no part of the minerals are conveyed or affected “except\nas hereinafter provided.” That portion of the reservation concludes that “none of the royalties,\nreversionary interests, or other rights of said parties under existing oil, gas and mineral leases shall\nbe affected in any manner by this instrument,” thereby limiting the foregoing language to those\nrights of the parties existing under leases in existence at the time of the execution of the partition\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By\nits express terms, the second part of the reservation controls the preceding portion.\n\nThe gist of appellants' argument is that the deed is unclear as to whether they are entitled to a\nset fraction of production or fractions of subsequent royalties to be determined by the terms of\nfuture leases.\n\n [2] Appellants' assertions are viable only if we ignore the introductory phrase of the second part\nof the reservation.

The court further held that:\n\n  Each tract was subject to a # royalty interest which was to be shared among the partitioners.

In addition, Tiller\nheld that the partition deed contained clear and unambiguous language that conveyed 1 /9 of the #\nroyalty, ( 1 /72) of all the oil, gas and other minerals produced from said land.” Therefore, the court\nrejected the arguments that the deed was ambiguous. 685 S.W.2d at 458.\n\n [3] Appellants also argue that ambiguity exists in the Acker Partition Deed due to the varying\ninterpretations of the terms “base” and “basic” one-eighth royalty. Appellants have attempted to\ncreate an ambiguity by focusing on out-of-context words or phrases, as opposed to interpreting\nsuch words or phrases within the context of the document as a whole.\n\nThe use of the terms “base” and “basic” were clearly not intended to expand or contract the\nfractional royalty interest reserved by the grantors in the Acker Partition Deed.

Therefore, the remainder of\nappellants' argument under this point of error is moot. Point of error one is overruled.\n\nIn their second point of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in finding that they were\nnot entitled to share in the overriding royalties received by Johnie Lorene Acker and her husband,\nand by Edwin V. Acker, Jr. Appellants assert that appellees identified certain mineral interest fees\nas bonus payments rather than royalties and that appellants are entitled to 4 /5 of these proceeds.\n\n [4] Questions concerning the classifications of royalty and mineral interests are immaterial to\nour disposition of this case. It is clear from the Acker Partition Deed that appellants parted with\nany rights to participate in bonuses, rentals, oil payments and production over and above an\nundivided four-fifths ( 4 /5) of a base one-eighth (#) royalty. The grantees in the Acker Partition\nDeed contractually limited their participation in the production from the property to sharing in\ntheir proportionate part of the one-eighth (#) royalty. Appellants are entitled to nothing more. Point\nof error two is overruled.\n\nIn their third point of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting *328 summary\njudgment where certain fact questions remained. Specifically, appellants assert that the following\nfact questions are in contention: whether the executive holder breached her duty of utmost good\nfaith and fair dealing by obtaining overriding royalties to the exclusion of the non-executives;\nwhether the appellees conspired to obtain assignments of overriding royalties with the intent to\ndefraud the non-executives of their proportionate interest in oil and gas production; and whether\nappellee Edwin V. Acker, Jr. tortiously interfered with appellants' contractual rights.\n\n [5] There can be no breach of duty by the executive receiving an overriding royalty interest where\nthe non-executives are entitled to participate only in a fraction of the production from the property.\nThis is the effect of the holdings in Helms and Tiller. Furthermore, the questions of conspiracy\nand tortious interference of contract become moot, because there can be no conspiracy to deprive\nappellants of an interest which they are not entitled to receive. Nor could Edwin V. Acker, Jr.\nhave interfered tortiously with appellants' contract rights if appellants were not entitled to share\nin more than their proportionate part of four-fifths ( 4 /5) of one-eighth (#) royalty. Point of error\nthree is overruled.\n\nIn their fourth point of error, appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to strike appellees'\ncounterclaims for declaratory relief and request for attorney fees under the Declaratory Judgments\nAct. Appellants assert that the subject matter of the counterclaim was already pending before the\ncourt, and the declaratory relief was sought for the sole purpose of providing a vehicle to obtain\nattorney fees. 2\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court signed\na docket control and pre-trial order on February 1, 1988. The trial court set the deadline for\namendments to pleadings by appellants for February 19, 1988. Appellants filed no special\nexceptions to appellees' counterclaim for declaratory relief. Appellants' motion to strike the\ncounterclaim for declaratory relief was filed on or about August 12, 1988.

After a jury returned its verdict interpreting the contract in Jamison's\nfavor, the trial court entered judgment for Jamison.\n\nIn three issues, XCO contends (1) the trial court erred by submitting a jury question regarding\ninterpretation of the contract because it is unambiguous and in XCO's favor as a matter of law,\n(2) Jamison's claim is barred by the four-year statute of limitations, and (3) Jamison's claim is\nbarred by a two-year contractual limitations period. We agree that the contract is unambiguous\nas a matter of law, but in Jamison's favor. Therefore, we conclude any error in submitting the\njury question was harmless. We further conclude XCO failed to prove that Jamison's breach of\ncontract claim is barred by the four-year statute of limitations or a contractual limitations period.\nAccordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BACKGROUND\n\nXCO is an oil and gas exploration company owned by Robert Gray. The company owned working\ninterests in oil and gas properties in Louisiana. Southampton Mineral Corporation was the operator\nfor these properties. In 1991, Jamison, who was interested in a low-risk investment opportunity\nthat would provide tax advantages and future income, was introduced to Gray by one of Jamison's\nfriends.\n\nJamison and XCO entered into a written “Memorandum of Agreement” (“Partnership\nAgreement”) effective December 13, 1991, whereby Jamison purchased a portion of XCO's\nworking interest in several Louisiana properties. The Partnership Agreement created a tax\npartnership (“Partnership”) between Jamison and XCO. 1 Under the Partnership Agreement,\nJamison made a $500,000.00 capital contribution to the partnership, and XCO contributed its\nworking interest in the properties. The disputed portion of the Partnership Agreement, paragraph\n9, concerns allocation of income and costs between XCO and Jamison:\n\n\n   9. Partnership Allocations. Each item of income, gain, loss or deduction shall be allocated\n      between XCO and JAMISON as follows:\n\n            (a) First, all [intangible drilling costs] and general and administrative costs paid from\n               December 13, 1991 through December 31, 1992, shall be allocated to JAMISON,\n               provided, however, that no such amounts shall be allocated to Jamison which would\n               cause his fair market value capital *626 account to become negative or increase its\n               negative position;\n\n            (b) Second, all depreciation with respect to tangibles held by the Tax Partnership or with\n               respect to the Weldon Operating Agreement and allocable to the XCO–JAMISON\n               partnership shall be allocated to JAMISON, provided, however, that such allocations,\n               in the aggregate, shall not cause his fair market value capital account to become\n               negative or increase its negative position;\n\n            (c) All costs other than those set forth in paragraphs 9.a and 9.b of this Memorandum\n               of Agreement shall be allocated to XCO;\n\n            (d) 30% of the XCO–JAMISON Partnership's net revenues, after adjustment for the\n               items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9.a, b and c of this Memorandum of Agreement,\n               shall be allocated to JAMISON until such time as he has received $500,000.00 in\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In contrast, Jamison claims XCO could allocate to him only the\ncosts listed in subparagraphs (a) and (b) (intangible drilling costs, general and administrative costs,\nand depreciation); and once $500,000.00 in costs were allocated to him, he was entitled to 30% of\nnet revenues, without regard to costs, until he recouped his initial $500,000.00 investment.\n\nBeginning in 1992, Southampton issued revenue and expense statements to the XCO–Jamison\nPartnership. The statements showed the gross income, taxes, royalties, and operating expenses of\nthe various properties, and the net profit or loss allocable to the aggregated working interests that\npartnered with Southampton in the properties. The statements did not directly show the amounts\nto be billed or credited to the XCO–Jamison Partnership, but instead listed the amounts of “Net\nto XCO” and “Jamison Net Profit.” “Net revenues” to Jamison, as addressed by paragraph 9(d) of\nthe Partnership Agreement, were not addressed by these statements; however, the statements did\nreflect that Southampton deducted expenses from “Jamison Net Profit” which were not included\nin paragraphs 9(a) or 9(b) of the Partnership Agreement.\n\nIn mid–1992, an unrelated lawsuit involving the properties was filed against XCO in Louisiana.\nThe Louisiana court ordered that all XCO's revenues be paid into the registry of the Louisiana\ncourt. The revenues were not released until early 1996. At that time, XCO told Jamison he would\nreceive no money because costs had greatly exceeded revenues.\n\nIn 1999, Jamison sued XCO for breach of contract alleging that XCO failed to pay monies\ndue and improperly charged costs to him. Jamison also alleged the Partnership Agreement was\nambiguous. After hearing the evidence, the trial court determined that the Partnership Agreement\nwas ambiguous and submitted a jury question regarding its meaning. Specifically, *627 the jury\nwas asked, “Did [XCO] and [Jamison] agree that [Jamison] would be paid 30% of net revenues\nafter Jamison's $500,000[.00] investment was expended only on costs allocated to Jamison in\nParagraph 9(a) and 9(b) of the parties' [Partnership] Agreement?” The jury answered “yes,”\nthus interpreting the Partnership Agreement in Jamison's favor. The trial court entered judgment\nawarding Jamison $417,173.00 in actual damages and $111,500.00 in attorneys' fees, as well as\npre-judgment and post-judgment interest.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We then must decide\nwhether both parties' interpretations are reasonable. If only one reasonable interpretation is offered,\nwe will not find the Partnership Agreement ambiguous, but will enforce the Partnership Agreement\naccording to its terms. After examining the Partnership Agreement and the circumstances present\nwhen it was made, we conclude that XCO's construction is not reasonable, but Jamison's\ninterpretation is reasonable.\n\n\nB. XCO'S INTERPRETATION\nIn support of its argument that only its interpretation is reasonable, XCO points to subparagraph\n9(d) which provides, “30% of the XCO–JAMISON Partnership's net revenues, after adjustment\nfor the items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9.a, b and c ... shall be allocated to\nJAMISON ....” (emphasis added). According to XCO, “after adjustment” means “subtract”; thus,\nall costs, including the costs set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), are to be subtracted from\nnet revenues before determining Jamison's 30% Payout. 3\n\nXCO states that because Jamison purchased a “working interest” in the properties and a “working\ninterest” is a cost-bearing interest, all costs had to be deducted from net revenues for Jamison's\ninterest to be a “working interest.” The court-appointed auditor who examined the Agreement in\nconnection with this suit opined in his report that all costs were to be deducted from net revenues\nto determine Jamison's Payout. This interpretation of subparagraph (d), however, creates several\nconflicts with the rest of paragraph 9. See J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 1</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755090/md-anderson-hosp-tumor-inst-v-willrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">3, 229\n(Tex.2003) (stating that in construing contracts, no single provision taken alone will be given\ncontrolling effect; rather, the court must consider the entire contract to harmonize and give effect\nto all its provisions, so that none will be rendered meaningless).\n\nFirst, under XCO's interpretation, subparagraph (d) conflicts with subparagraphs (a) and (b).\nSubparagraphs (a) and (b) state that certain costs are to be allocated to Jamison's capital account.\nHowever, according to XCO, under subparagraph (d), these same costs are to be subtracted from\nnet revenues to determine Jamison's Payout. Therefore, XCO's interpretation creates a conflict as\nto how the costs are to be treated.\n\nFurther, under XCO's interpretation, subparagraph (d) conflicts with subparagraph (c).\nSubparagraph (c) provides that all costs other than intangible drilling costs, general and\nadministrative costs, and depreciation are to be allocated to XCO. But, subtracting these “other”\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  14\n\fXCO Production Co. v.

That reasoning, however, conflicts\nwith subparagraphs (a) and (b) which provide that “no such amounts shall be allocated to Jamison\nthat would cause his fair market value capital account to become negative or increase its negative\nposition.” Allocating all costs, regardless of amount, to Jamison could cause his capital account\n($500,000.00) to become negative.\n\nFinally, XCO's interpretation does not reconcile the use of the term “net revenues” in subparagraph\n(d) with the use of the term “net profits” in subparagraph (e). According to XCO, under\nsubparagraph (d), all costs are to be subtracted from “net revenues” to determine Jamison's Payout.\nHowever, under subparagraph (e), after Jamison's Payout reaches $500,000.00, he then receives\n1.25% of “net profits.” If “net revenues” include all costs as urged by XCO, then the use of the\nterm “net profits” in subparagraph (e) is rendered meaningless; it would be merely synonymous\nwith “net revenues.” By using different terms, the parties recognized the difference between the\ntwo terms and manifested their intention to treat “net revenue” separately from “net profit.” See\nSun Oil Co., 626 S.W.2d at 728 (where parties used different terms for oil and gas in a lease, it\nwas apparent the parties understood the difference and intended to treat them separately). XCO's\ninterpretation fails to explain how Jamison's interest converts from a “net revenues” interest to a\n“net profits” interest if all costs are already being deducted from “net revenues.”\n\nBecause XCO's interpretation creates several internal conflicts in paragraph 9, we conclude that\nXCO's interpretation is not reasonable.\n\n\nC. JAMISON'S INTERPRETATION\n[12] [13] [14] To substantiate his interpretation of paragraph 9, Jamison relies on the testimony\nof Shelly Cashion, his tax lawyer who drafted the Partnership Agreement. 4 Cashion testified the\nPartnership Agreement was an “odd duck” because it included accounting methodology unique\nto tax partnerships. According to Cashion, in oil and gas taxation, “allocate,” “adjust,” “net\nrevenues,” and “net profits” are terms of art. Cashion defined these terms as follows:\n\n\n   “Allocate ”: means to divide tax items among partners.\n\n         “Adjust ”: is the consequence of that “allocation.” “Adjust” does not mean “subtract” or\n           “deduct.” Rather, tax *630 items are “allocated” to a partner, and the partner's capital\n           account is “adjusted” to account for that “allocation.”\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jamison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870802\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870802/xco-production-co-v-jamison/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006)\n163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n\n         “Net revenues ”: means the cash from oil and gas production minus severance taxes and\n           royalties only.\n\n         “Net profits ”: means “net revenues” minus “lease operating expenses,” which are the\n           operating costs of the business.\n\n   Applying these definitions to paragraph 9, Cashion explained that pursuant to subparagraphs (a)\n      and (b), intangible drilling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation are\n      allocated to Jamison's capital account until his capital account reaches zero. In other words,\n      Jamison receives a total allocation of no more than $500,000.00 in intangible drilling costs,\n      general and administrative expenses, and depreciation. Pursuant to subparagraph (c), all other\n      costs are allocated to XCO's capital account.\nNext, Cashion explained the operation of the disputed subparagraph (d). She testified that the\nphrase “after adjustment for the items of cost set forth in paragraphs 9(a), (b), and (c)” does not\nrequire that all the costs outlined in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) be subtracted from net revenues\nto determine Jamison's Payout. Rather, the phrase is a “timing mechanism.” After these costs\nare allocated to the respective capital accounts pursuant to subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) and\nJamison's capital account reaches zero, Jamison receives 30% of net revenues until he recoups\nhis $500,000.00 capital contribution. Thus, Jamison does not receive a percentage of net revenues\nuntil his capital account is exhausted. Further, because the term “net revenues” is used, Jamison\nreceives 30% of net revenues without regard to costs, including lease operating expenses. In sum,\nthe Partnership spends Jamison's $500,000.00, then pays Jamison a percentage of net revenues\nuntil Jamison's initial $500,000.00 is repaid in full.\n\nCashion then stated that pursuant to subparagraph (e), once Jamison recoups his $500,000.00, his\ninterest would convert to receiving 1.25% of “net profits,” which means he is then charged with\na proportionate share of all costs, including lease operating expenses.\n\nWe conclude Cashion's explanation of paragraph 9 is reasonable because, inter alia, her definitions\nof “allocate” and “adjustment” resolve any conflicts between the subparagraphs. Further,\nCashion's distinction between “net revenues” and “net profits” explains the parties' decision to\nuse the term “net revenues” in subparagraph (d), and “net profits” in subparagraph (e). 5 It is also\nconsistent with the *631 way in which tax partnerships use those terms, and with Gray's own use\nof the terms in negotiating the Partnership Agreement.\n\nJamison's interpretation is also consistent with the circumstances existing when the contract was\nexecuted and the “particular business activity” to be served. See Hewlett–Packard, 142 S.W.3d\nat 561 (“We construe a contract from a utilitarian standpoint, bearing in mind the particular\nbusiness activity sought to be served”). It is undisputed that, from the outset of their relationship,\nJamison consistently represented to Gray that he wanted a low-risk investment with maximum tax\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In return, Jamison was willing to receive\nonly a small percentage of the net profits over the long term. If the parties had agreed that revenues\ncould be reduced by all potential costs before calculating Jamison's Payout, as urged by XCO,\nJamison's investment would not have been low-risk.\n\nThe most significant evidence of the circumstances present when the contract was made is a letter\nfrom Gray to Jamison outlining XCO's proposal. Gray stated that XCO anticipated incurring a\ncertain amount of general and administrative costs and intangible drilling costs in a short time\nperiod with respect to the properties. Gray proposed that Jamison “reimburse” XCO for these\ncosts. Gray also proposed that Jamison\n\n            would receive a defined percentage of XCO's monthly production revenues\n            on a preferential basis computed without regard to expense. After [Jamison]\n            had recouped the value of his investment, his interest in the partnership would\n            convert to a ‘net profits interest’ such that he would receive a significantly\n            reduced percentage of the net profits attributable to the partnership.\n\n(emphasis added). 6 This proposal is consistent with Jamison's argument that only certain costs\nwere to be allocated to him; then, he would recoup his investment out of net revenues without\nregard to operating costs before his interest converted to a net profits interest. 7\n\nNevertheless, Gray testified that the portion of his proposal offering to return Jamison's investment\n“on a preferential basis computed without regard to expense” was not embodied in the final\nPartnership Agreement. According to Gray, Cashion and XCO's tax lawyer advised him that his\nproposal could not be utilized because it created, in effect, a cost-less interest that would not allow\nJamison any tax deductions.\n\nAt trial, however, Cashion explained her concerns with the initial proposal. She stated that Gray's\nproposal would result in Jamison's immediately recouping his investment out of net revenues.\nCashion feared the IRS might view such an arrangement as a loan, rather than an investment,\nand thus disallow any deductions. Therefore, she and XCO's tax attorney decided to draft the\nPartnership *632 Agreement so as to postpone Jamison's participation in net revenues until\nhis investment had been exhausted through allocation of the costs outlined in subparagraphs (a)\nand (b). 8 Therefore, Gray's proposal that Jamison recoup his investment on a “on a preferential\nbasis computed without regard to expense” was embodied in the final Partnership Agreement.\nHowever, Cashion's tax concerns were alleviated by modifying the timing for Jamison to recoup\nhis investment. 9\n\n[15] In sum, Jamison's interpretation is reasonable because it reconciles the subparagraphs of\nparagraph 9 and is consistent with the circumstances present when the Partnership Agreement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Southampton's Statements Are Not Attributable to XCO.\nXCO is not only the appellant, but also bore the burden of proof to establish its limitations defense\nat trial; we therefore address its argument first.\n\nXCO contends that to the extent it breached the contract, the breach occurred when XCO sent\nJamison accounting statements in 1993 that allegedly demonstrated XCO's improper deduction\nof expenses from Jamison's account; but, Jamison correctly points out that the statements relied\nupon by XCO were actually issued by Southampton to the XCO–Jamison Partnership. XCO\nresponds that Southampton's accounting statements to the Partnership constitute XCO's statements\nto Jamison because the Partnership Agreement states that Southampton is the Operator, and\nbecause XCO's president is also the president of Southampton. Additionally, XCO points out that\nSouthampton's office address shown on the statements is the same as XCO's office address.\n\n [22] Texas law presumes that two separate corporations are distinct entities, and “a party seeking\nto ascribe one corporation's actions to another by disregarding their distinct corporate entities\nmust prove this allegation.” *634 BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v.

Moreover, Southampton's statements to the Partnership do not purport to represent XCO's\naccounting of the intra-Partnership allocations required by the Partnership Agreement. 11 The\nstatements bear no indication that they were prepared by XCO, make no mention of the Partnership\nAgreement, do not report on XCO and Jamison's capital accounts, and do not perform the\ncalculations required by the Partnership Agreement.\n\n [23] [24] We further note that a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run\nwhen facts come into existence that authorize a party to seek a judicial remedy.

Even assuming that Jamison could have complained of errors in Southampton's\nstatements, we are aware of no authority to support the proposition that Southampton's statements\ntriggered Jamison's right to a judicial remedy against XCO. The statements were not prepared\npursuant to or in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and imply nothing regarding XCO's\nintent to abide by its terms. Moreover, XCO did not claim that Southampton's statements were\ncorrect; to the contrary, XCO admitted that the statements contained errors. XCO did not represent\nto Jamison that it would adopt the Southampton's accounting conclusions; to the contrary, XCO\nrepresented that it would correct the accounting statements and pay Jamison the net revenue due\nhim when the funds were released from the Louisiana court. Finally, XCO has not shown that\nSouthampton's erroneous statements injured Jamison. See Southwell v.

Because the arguments and evidence adduced by\nJamison offer independent grounds for affirmance, we address those as well.\n\n\n2. XCO Did Not Refuse to Pay Net Revenue Before 1996.\nJamison contends that XCO's failure to pay Jamison in 1993–1995 was not the result of a breach of\ncontract, but was instead caused by the Louisiana court's retention of the funds from 1992 until the\nearly part of 1996. Specifically, Jamison claims that prior to 1996, XCO did not refuse to pay net\nrevenues that were “due and payable” because (a) there was no refusal to pay, (b) there was no net\nrevenue, and (c) if there was net revenue, it was not “due and payable” until released by the court.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

According to Jamison, while the revenues were frozen, XCO reassured Jamison that he\nwould receive his Payout when the revenues were released. Specifically, Jamison testified without\ncontradiction that while the revenues were frozen, he asked Gray periodically about the status of\nthe Louisiana suit. Gray responded that the suit was going well and said, “don't worry [,] your\nmoney is in there. Once we wrap this up, you're going to get your money. You are due your money,\nyour net revenue.” Jamison also testified that during 1992, he addressed with Gray whether his\n$500,000.00 investment was being properly allocated. Gray responded that XCO's accounting was\na “mess,” and “we really don't know whether it is expended or not expended or whatever, but it\ndoesn't matter because you're ... going to get paid on this anyway because you're going to get your\n$500,000[.00].” Thus, the first “refusal to pay” occurred in 1996, fewer than four years before\nJamison filed suit.\n\nMoreover, the existence and extent of “net revenue” available to the Partnership is a question of\nfact that was not presented to the jury. Because XCO claimed Jamison's suit was time-barred,\nXCO bore the burden to obtain findings of fact necessary to support this affirmative defense.\nHaving failed to do so, we cannot say that Jamison's cause of action accrued during a time when\nnet revenues were not proven. 12\n\n*636 [25] In sum, we conclude XCO did not prove as a matter of law that Jamison's claim\naccrued more than four years before Jamison filed suit. 13\n\n\n\n                         IV. CONTRACTUAL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n [26] In its third issue, XCO contends that Jamison's breach of contract claim was also barred by a\ncontractual time limitations clause. This argument was raised for the first time in XCO's motion for\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict. Although an answer filed jointly by XCO, Robert Gray, and\nSouthampton asserts that “any claims for an accounting are restricted by the applicable limitations\nperiod of the Joint Operating Agreements attached to the [Partnership Agreement],” XCO did not\nassert that the agreements between Southampton and the non-operators barred Jamison's claim\nthat XCO breached its Partnership Agreement with Jamison.\n\nThe Partnership Agreement gives Jamison a part of XCO's share in the Lake Boeuf Operating\nAgreement, the Weldon Operating Agreement, and the Lake Boeuf Tax Partnership (collectively,\nthe “Operating Agreements”). The terms of each of these Operating Agreements, “except to\nthe extent expressly inconsistent [with the Partnership Agreement],” are incorporated into the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Operating Agreements incorporate the “Accounting Procedure and\nJoint Operations” agreement (“APJO Agreement”) between Southampton, as the operator, and the\nnon-operator parties to the Operating Agreements. The APJO Agreement addresses Southampton's\nstatements and billings to non-operators, and provides in pertinent part:\n\n            [A]ll bills and statements rendered to Non–Operators by Operator during any\n            calendar year shall conclusively be presumed to be true and correct after twenty-\n            four (24) months following the end of any such calendar year, unless within the\n            said twenty-four month period a Non–Operator takes written exception thereto\n            and makes claim on Operator for adjustment.\n\nAccording to XCO, this provision imposed a two-year limitations period for Jamison to sue XCO\nregarding improper deductions from net revenues during a given year. We disagree.\n\nThis provision applies to accounting procedures between the operator and the non-operators.\nSouthampton is the operator for these properties; XCO and other entities were the non-operators.\nJamison purchased a portion of XCO's non-operator interest in the properties under a separate\nPartnership Agreement, and his dispute is with XCO over the terms of that Partnership Agreement.\nJamison's dispute is not with Southampton. In short, this dispute is not between the operator and\na non-operator. Rather, this dispute is between two partners who together constitute a single non-\noperator. Therefore, this provision does not impose a two-year contractual limitations period on\nJamison with respect *637 to his breach of contract claim against XCO. 14 We overrule XCO's\nthird issue.\n\n\n\n                                            V. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, we hold the Partnership Agreement is unambiguous as a matter of law, but in Jamison's\nfavor. We further hold that XCO failed to prove that Jamison's breach of contract claim was barred\nby the four-year statute of limitations or a contractual limitations period. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870802\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870802/xco-production-co-v-jamison/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 Oil & Gas Rep. 605\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They were not considered partners with\n      respect to liabilities and obligations under state law. Jamison's tax attorney testified that the federal government permits this type of\n      arrangement to stimulate oil and gas investment.\n2     In its brief, XCO frames its first issue in several different ways. However, the theme of its complaint is that the trial court erred in\n      submitting the jury question because the Partnership Agreement is unambiguous as a matter of law. XCO does not challenge the\n      sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding.\n3     According to XCO, these costs include all lease operating expenses, in addition to intangible drilling costs, general and administrative\n      costs, and depreciation. The lease operating expenses are at the center of this dispute. There is evidence that lease operating expenses\n      are the primary type of other costs addressed in subparagraph (c). Further, XCO deducted large amounts of lease operating expenses\n      from net revenues pursuant to its interpretation of the Partnership Agreement.\n4     XCO contends that Cashion's testimony, as well as all evidence regarding the parties' intent, is inadmissible parol evidence. Extrinsic\n      evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity or vary the terms of an unambiguous agreement; however, when determining\n      whether an agreement is ambiguous, we may examine extrinsic evidence to interpret the terms used by the parties and extrinsic\n      evidence of the circumstances surrounding execution of the agreement.

Co., 157 S.W.3d at 465. Jamison offered the testimony of Ms.\n      Cashion, as well as the testimony of its expert who reviewed the Partnership Agreement in connection with this suit for this purpose.\n      XCO also offered the report of the court-appointed auditor, who agreed with XCO's interpretation. This evidence was not admitted\n      to create an ambiguity or to vary the terms of the Partnership Agreement, but to explain its specialized terms.\n5     XCO has not offered a contrary definition for the terms used in the Partnership Agreement that is reasonable. In his report, the\n      court-appointed auditor stated that a “net revenues” interest is substantially the same as a “net profits” interest for purposes of this\n      Partnership Agreement. This fails to explain the use of the two different terms in subparagraphs (d) and (e). Further, the auditor stated\n      that his audit was based on Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies (COPAS) principles. Jamison's expert testified that COPAS\n      explicitly defines “net revenues” as gross proceeds less royalties and severance taxes; and COPAS explicitly defines “net profits” as\n      gross proceeds less royalties, severance taxes, and operating expenses. In fact, later in his report, the auditor seems to acknowledge\n      that the terms are not the same. In particular, the auditor later summarizes the partnership's revenues, costs, and Jamison's interest. The\n      auditor has two separate categories entitled: “Net Revenues allocated to Jamison (per paragraph 9d of the [Partnership Agreement] )”\n      and “Net Profit Interest (per paragraph 9e of the [Partnership Agreement] ).” With respect to the latter category, the auditor notes\n      that the net profit interest “[i]s not applicable until such time that the Net Revenue distribution reaches $500,000[.00].”\n6     Gray attached a pro forma projecting production from the properties on a monthly basis and Jamison's corresponding potential return\n      on his investment. Gray proposed two alternatives based on Jamison's contribution of $500,000.00 or $1 million. The pro forma\n      shows Jamison's potential return under both scenarios. Under both scenarios, Jamison's return is 30% of net revenues without regard\n      to expenses.\n7     Craig Crawford, Jamison's friend who introduced him to Gray, testified that Gray outlined a general proposal during their initial\n      meetings. Gray represented that Jamison would be given “preferential treatment” on the “front end” until he recouped $500,000.00;\n      Jamison would then receive a smaller residual interest on the “tail end.”\n8     XCO's tax attorney did not testify, and, thus, did not controvert Cashion's explanation.\n\n9     Cashion also testified regarding two other changes between the proposal and final Partnership Agreement, as well as a subsequent\n      amendment. However, these changes and amendment are not pertinent to this dispute.\n10    Robert Gray owns 100% of XCO and 50% of Southampton. Although Jamison alleged that Gray was the alter ego of XCO and\n      Southampton, the allegation was denied by Gray, XCO, and Southampton.\n11    For example, Southampton's February 1993 accounting statement lists the gross revenue, taxes, royalties and operating expenses\n      associated with the various properties, and from these figures, calculates the “net to working interests.” The statement then lists “net\n      to XCO” and “Jamison net profit,” though it is undisputed that Jamison had not received $500,000.00 in distributions at this time. In\n      contrast, the Partnership Agreement requires the calculation of Jamison's net revenue—not net profit—until he receives $500,000.00\n      in distributions. Thus, Southampton's calculation of “Jamison net profit” is not the equivalent of XCO's required calculation of\n      Jamison's net revenue. This particular statement also indicates that a “workover” expense of $869,700.00 for the St. Charles Church\n      well was charged against the “net to working interests” and deducted in part from both “net to XCO” and “Jamison net profit.”\n      Southampton therefore lists “Jamison net profit” as a negative number, despite the fact that Jamison had not reached “Payout” and\n      his interest had not yet converted from net revenue to net profit.\n12    Jamison additionally argues that, under the doctrine of impossibility, a party prevented by a government order from performing his\n      contractual obligation is excused.

Because the existence and extent of “net\n      revenue” due to Jamison were not determined at trial, we do not reach this issue.\n13    XCO also asserts that the trial court erred by submitting a jury question that asked if, prior to July 30, 1995 (i.e., four years before suit),\n      Jamison discovered or should have discovered facts causing him to believe he had a claim for breach of the Partnership Agreement.\n      The jury answered, “no.” Because XCO failed to prove that Jamison's cause of action accrued more than four years before suit,\n      the discovery rule is inapplicable. However, submission of the jury question was harmless, because XCO did not establish that a\n      breach of the Partnership Agreement occurred before July 30, 1995. See also City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435512/city-of-brownsville-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n      752 (Tex.1995) (“Submission of an improper jury question can be harmless error if the jury's answers to other questions render the\n      improper question immaterial.”).\n14    On appeal, XCO contends for the first time that this limitations provision applies to accounting disputes between XCO and Jamison\n      because Gray was an officer of both XCO and Southampton, Southampton issued Jamison's checks, and Southampton sent Jamison\n      accounting statements from the same address as XCO. These facts do not change the terms of the Operating Agreements or the\n      APJO Agreement. Those agreements state, and XCO admits, that Southampton is the operator. This limitations provision governs\n      accounting between the operator and non-operator. It does not impose a limitations period on Jamison's suit against XCO.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
