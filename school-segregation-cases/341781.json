At the time Appellants\n\fapplied, the City used a hiring process that placed applicants into\n\nseparate lists according to race and sex.                           The City created its\n\nrace-conscious hiring process in an attempt to comply with a 1980\n\nconsent decree drafted to end discriminatory hiring practices in\n\nthe City’s fire department and to remedy the effects of past\n\ndiscrimination.            Appellants challenge both the decree and the\n\nhiring process.\n\n                                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In 1977, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a\n\nlawsuit against the City alleging its fire department used racially\n\nand sexually discriminatory hiring practices.                                To settle the\n\nlawsuit, the City signed a proposed consent decree providing a plan\n\nto end then-current discriminatory practices and remedy the effects\n\nof past discrimination.                Although the City signed the decree, it\n\ndid not admit to any unlawful discrimination.                             Because the City\n\ndeclined to admit to unlawful discrimination, the district court\n\ninitially refused to enter the decree.                        United States v. City of\n\nAlexandria, No. 77-2040, 1977 WL 69 (E.D. La. July 22, 1977).\n\nHowever, in 1980, this Court reversed the district court and\n\nordered      the     decree      be    entered.          United      States      v.    City     of\n\nAlexandria, 614 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir. 1980).1\n\n\n       1\n         We reviewed the decree at that time under a rat ional basis standard of review. City of\nAlexandria, 614 F.2d at 1363 (inquiring whether the decree was “reasonably related to the legitimate\nstate goal of achieving equality of employment opportunity”). This standard of review no longer\napplies, and we now strictly scrutinize all race-conscious remedies to ensure they are narrowly\ntailored to achieve a compelling government interest. City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n\n                                                 2\n\f       To remedy the effects of past discrimination, the decree sets\n\nforth a long-term goal that the City achieve – subject to the\n\navailability of qualified applicants – the same proportions of\n\nblacks and women in its fire department “as blacks and women bear\n\nto the appropriate work force in the particular jurisdiction.”2\n\nHowever, the decree does not define “appropriate work force.”                                    The\n\ndecree also requires the City to adopt an interim hiring goal of\n\nfilling at least fifty percent of all firefighter vacancies with\n\nqualified black applicants and at least fifteen percent with\n\nqualified female applicants.                    The interim goal remains in effect\n\nuntil the long-term goal is achieved and maintained for one year.\n\n       The decree itself does not mandate any particular hiring\n\nprocess for meeting its goals.                   Therefore, the City formed its own\n\nprocess.3        Phase one requires all firefighter applicants to take\n\nthe Civil Service Exam.               To pass, an applicant needs a score of at\n\n\n\n469, 493-94 (1989). Thus, as we re-evaluate the decree under strict scrutiny, we are not bound by\nour prior approval of it under the rational basis standard.\n       2\n        The decree is published as an appendix to City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d at 1367-72.\n       3\n          The City’s hiring process remained substantially the same from the time the decree was\nentered until Appellants were denied employment between 2000 and 2002. In 2004, the City changed\nits hiring process. The City claims it continues to strive toward the interim and long-term goals in\nthe decree, but that its new hiring process is race-neutral. Much to this Court’s dissatisfaction, the\nCity has kept secret the details of its new hiring process. In addition, the City has failed to explain\nhow it expects its new allegedly race-neutral hiring process to meet the goals of the decree when its\nold race-conscious process apparently did not. In any event, we limit our analysis to the hiring\nprocess the City used at the time Appellants were denied employment because it is that process\nAppellants argue violated their rights. We refer to the City’s old hiring process in the present tense\nin our opinion purely to avoid continuous, and possibly confusing, tense changes.\n\n                                                  3\n\fleast seventy-five.     Points are then added to the scores of\n\napplicants with prior emergency medical or paramedic training or\n\nmilitary service.   When the final numerical scores are calculated,\n\nthe applicants are separated into three lists: a white male list,\n\na black male list, and a female list.   Each list is ranked by exam\n\nscore from highest to lowest.   The City then determines how many\n\nfirefighter positions it needs to fill. Finally, starting with the\n\nhighest exam score on each list, the City selects approximately\n\ntwice as many applicants as vacant spots to proceed to phase two of\n\nthe hiring process. Of those selected to proceed, fifty percent of\n\nthe males are white and fifty percent are black.   Every female who\n\nreceives a seventy-five on the exam usually proceeds to phase two\n\nbecause of the extremely low number of female applicants.\n\n     Phase two includes six additional steps an applicant must pass\n\nto become a firefighter: (1) an agility test; (2) a general\n\npreliminary interview, screening for disqualifying conduct, such as\n\ndrug use; (3) a criminal background check; (4) a polygraph exam;\n\n(5) a psychological exam and interview; and (6) a medical exam.   An\n\napplicant who fails any step is immediately denied employment.    An\n\napplicant who passes each step is immediately awarded employment.\n\n     Under this hiring process, Appellants’ exam scores in phase\n\none were too low on the white male list to proceed to phase two.\n\n                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     In October 2000, Appellant Jeffery Todd Dean (“Dean”), an\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\funsuccessful white male applicant, sued the City under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983, alleging the decree and the hiring process violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                           Dean and the City\n\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment.                           In 2002, during the\n\npendency of those motions, eight additional white male applicants\n\nbrought similar discrimination suits against the City. In addition\n\nto Dean’s equal protection claim, they asserted claims under Title\n\nVII,       the    Louisiana         Constitution,          and      a     Louisiana        anti-\n\ndiscrimination employment statute.4                       The cases were consolidated\n\nwith Dean’s, and all eight joined his pending motion for summary\n\njudgment.        All parties stipulated to proceed before a magistrate\n\njudge.      In October 2004, the magistrate judge denied Dean’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment and granted the City’s, dismissing all claims\n\nagainst the City.           This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\nI. Applicable Standard of Review\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo\n\nand apply the same standards as the district court.                                Daniels v.\n\nCity of Arlington, 246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir. 2001).                                   Summary\n\njudgment is proper only “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories,           and    admissions         on    file,        together     with     the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\n\n       4\n        We address a total of four claims on appeal. However, not all nine Appellants brought each\nof these claims below. Therefore, on remand the district court’s first order of business will be to\ndetermine the effects of our decision today on each individual Appellant.\n\n                                                5\n\fmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.”      FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); see also Priester v.\n\nLowndes County, 354 F.3d 414, 419 (5th Cir. 2004). “If the moving\n\nparty meets the initial burden of showing there is no genuine issue\n\nof material fact, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to\n\nproduce evidence or designate specific facts showing the existence\n\nof a genuine issue for trial.”         Priester, 354 F.3d at 419.        We\n\nresolve doubts in favor of the nonmoving party and make all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of that party.          Id.\n\nII. Appellants’ Equal Protection Clause Claim\n\n     Appellants first contend that the consent decree and the\n\nCity’s hiring process violate their right to equal protection under\n\nthe United States Constitution.\n\n     a. Strict Scrutiny\n\n     The   Equal   Protection   Clause    of   the   Fourteenth   Amendment\n\nprovides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its\n\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”          U.S. CONST. amend.\n\nXIV, § 1 (emphasis added); see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson\n\nCo., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).           “Classifications based on race\n\ncarry a danger of stigmatic harm . . . [and] may in fact promote\n\nnotions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial\n\nhostility.”    Croson, 488 U.S. at 493.         Thus, all race-conscious\n\nmeasures receive strict scrutiny review under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.    See id. at 493-94; see also Black Fire Fighters Ass’n v.\n\n\n                                   6\n\fCity of Dallas, 19 F.3d 992, 995 n.6 (5th Cir. 1994) (explaining\n\nthat this standard applies to consent decrees).         Strict scrutiny\n\nreview demands that a race-conscious measure be (1) justified by a\n\ncompelling government interest and (2) narrowly tailored to further\n\nthat interest.   Police Ass’n ex rel. Cannatella v. City of New\n\nOrleans, 100 F.3d 1159, 1167 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n          1. Compelling Interest\n\n     It is well settled that the government has a compelling\n\ninterest in remedying its own past discrimination.            See United\n\nStates v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167 (1987).       However, a general\n\nassertion of past societal discrimination is insufficient.           See\n\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 499.    Rather, the government must justify its\n\naction with a showing of past discrimination by the governmental\n\nunit seeking to use the race-conscious remedy.      See id. at 495-97;\n\nsee also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 276 (1986);\n\nPolice Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1168.\n\n     The Supreme Court has offered little guidance as to how much\n\nevidence of   past   discrimination    is   required.   Id.     However,\n\n“[t]here is no doubt that ‘[w]here gross statistical disparities\n\ncan be shown, they alone in a proper case may constitute prima\n\nfacie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.’”        Croson,\n\n488 U.S. at 501 (alteration in original) (quoting Hazelwood Sch.\n\nDist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977)).      The relevant\n\nstatistical comparison is between the number of minorities in the\n\n\n                                   7\n\fwork force of the governmental unit and “the number of minorities\n\nqualified to undertake the particular task.”          See Croson, 488 U.S.\n\nat 502.\n\n     Appellants argue that even in 1980, the City had no compelling\n\ninterest to justify the decree or a race-conscious hiring process.\n\nAppellants point out that the decree is not based on any formal\n\nfactual finding of past discrimination. Further, the City’s hiring\n\nprocess was adopted solely to comply with the goals of the decree.\n\nAppellants urge us to hold that a governmental unit may use a race-\n\nconscious remedy only after a formal judicial, legislative, or\n\nadministrative finding of past discrimination.         The City maintains\n\nthat in 1980 it clearly had a compelling interest.                The City\n\nconcedes that a formal finding of past discrimination was never\n\nmade, but insists that one was not required.\n\n     We agree with the City.       Nothing in Supreme Court or Fifth\n\nCircuit precedent   compels   us   to   require   a    formal   finding   of\n\ndiscrimination prior to the use of a race-conscious remedy.         To the\n\ncontrary, in Police Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1167-68, we stated that\n\n“Croson does not require a city to incriminate itself by proving\n\nits own participation in past discrimination.”              It is when a\n\nremedial program is challenged that a trial court must make a\n\nfactual determination that there was a strong basis in evidence for\n\nthe conclusion that remedial action was necessary.          Thus, what we\n\nmeant in Police Ass’n was that the government need not incriminate\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\fitself with a formal finding of discrimination prior to using a\n\nrace-conscious remedy, but if the remedy is later challenged, a\n\ncourt must determine there was a strong evidentiary basis for its\n\nenactment.       This approach is consistent with pre-Croson Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.          See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (explaining that\n\n“[e]videntiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is\n\nwarranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is challenged\n\nin court by nonminorit[ies]” (emphasis added)); see also id. at 289\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing that “a contemporaneous or\n\nantecedent   finding       of     past   discrimination       .    .   .   is    not   a\n\nconstitutional prerequisite . . . to an affirmative action plan”\n\n(emphasis added)).          This approach is also in line with other\n\ncircuits that have addressed the issue.               See, e.g., Aiken v. City\n\nof Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1162-63 (6th Cir. 1994) (“No formal\n\nfinding of past discrimination by the government unit involved is\n\nnecessary    .    .   .    .”);    see    also   In    re    Birmingham         Reverse\n\nDiscrimination Employment Litig., 20 F.3d 1525, 1539 (11th Cir.\n\n1994) (explaining that the government “was not required to make\n\nformal findings about its own past discrimination--it merely had to\n\nhave a strong basis in evidence”(emphasis added)).                     Thus, to the\n\nextent our prior decisions were unclear, we now clarify that when\n\na governmental unit employs a race-conscious remedy, it need not\n\nhave   already     made    a    formal   finding      of    past   discrimination.\n\nNevertheless, if the remedy is later challenged, the reviewing\n\n\n                                          9\n\fcourt must ensure there was strong evidence of past discrimination\n\nwarranting the remedy.               We turn now to whether strong evidence of\n\ndiscrimination existed in this case, such that in 1980 the City had\n\na compelling interest in remedying it.\n\n       The district court concluded that the City made an adequate\n\nshowing of past discrimination.                       We agree.          Prior to 1974, the\n\nCity’s fire department had never hired a black employee.                             In 1974,\n\nafter       it   was     sued       by    black       applicants         alleging    racially\n\ndiscriminatory          hiring       practices,         the    City      hired   three   black\n\nfirefighters.          After the lawsuit was settled, the City hired no\n\nblack employees in 1975, just one black firefighter in 1976, and no\n\nblack employees in 1977.                   In 1977, another lawsuit was brought\n\nagainst the City, this time by the DOJ, alleging racially and\n\nsexually discriminatory hiring practices.                           In the time between the\n\n1977       lawsuit     and    the    1980      decree,        the    City    hired   only   six\n\nadditional black firefighters.                    Thus, when the decree was entered\n\nto settle the DOJ lawsuit, only 10 of the City’s 270 firefighters\n\nwere black.5           At that time, blacks accounted for approximately\n\nforty percent of the general population in the City of Shreveport.\n\nFurther, the City now admits it systematically excluded all black\n\napplicants prior to 1974 and hired the few it did between 1974 and\n\n1980 in response to pending lawsuits.                         Appellants do not contest\n\nthese statistics and offer no alternative explanation for them,\n\n\n       5\n        By 1980, the City still had not hired a single female firefighter.\n\n                                                 10\n\fexpert or otherwise.\n\n      We recognize that the relevant comparison when determining\n\nwhether discrimination existed is between the number of black\n\nfirefighters in the City’s fire department and the “number of\n\n[blacks] qualified to undertake the particular task,”             see Croson,\n\n488   U.S.   at   502,   not   the   number   of   blacks   in   the   general\n\npopulation, see id.        We are also aware that the City has not\n\npresented a precise calculation of how many black applicants were\n\nqualified to become firefighters in the years leading up to the\n\n1980 decree.      Nevertheless, we find it inconceivable that the\n\nnumber of qualified blacks was an “emphatic zero.”               See Dean v.\n\nCity of Shreveport, No. 00-2372, slip op. at 14 (W.D. La. Oct. 22,\n\n2004) (quoting Guice v. Fortenberry, 661 F.2d 496, 505 (5th Cir.\n\n1981) (en banc)).\n\n      In most cases, a governmental unit’s failure to provide\n\nstatistical data comparing the number of minorities in its work\n\nforce with the number of minorities qualified to undertake the\n\nparticular task, rather than the number of minorities in the\n\ngeneral population, will prove fatal to an attempt to show past\n\ndiscrimination.     See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 501-02 (finding no\n\ncompelling interest in remedying past discrimination because the\n\ngovernment failed to show how many minorities in the relevant\n\nmarket were qualified to undertake the particular task).                But in\n\nrare cases, the statistical disparity may be so great between a\n\n\n\n                                      11\n\fparticular work force and the general population that, along with\n\nother overwhelming evidence, it may provide us with an adequate\n\nbasis to conclude no genuine factual issue remains regarding the\n\nexistence of past discrimination.\n\n       This is such a case.                 In addition to the fact that the City\n\nhired      no    black     employees         prior         to   1974    and   only     10    black\n\nfirefighters as of 1980, the overwhelming evidence shows that (1)\n\nthe City now admits that for over 100 years it systematically\n\nexcluded all minorities from its fire department; (2) the City has\n\nbeen sued numerous times for racial and sexual discrimination; and\n\n(3) Appellants have failed to offer any alternative explanation,\n\nexpert      or     otherwise,         for     the      gross      statistical        disparity.\n\nTherefore, the district court properly concluded that the City had\n\na   compelling        interest       in     1980      to    enter      into   the    decree     and\n\nimplement a race-conscious hiring process.6\n\n       The City argues that this conclusion ends our compelling\n\ninterest inquiry.               We disagree.               In addition to showing past\n\n\n\n       6\n         Again, we do not intend to suggest a statistical disparity between a work force and the\ngeneral population, without additional overwhelming evidence, is enough to show past discrimination.\nHad the City not admitted to systematically excluding blacks from its work force and twice previously\nbeen sued for racial discrimination, our decision today might have been different. See Paradise, 480\nU.S. at 169 (taking into account that the governmental unit systematically excluded minorities and\nhad previously faced numerous allegations of racial discrimination). Similarly, our decision might\nhave been different had Appellants rebutted the City’s evidence or offered an alternative explanation,\nthereby raising some genuine factual issue. See Priester v. Lowndes County, 354 F.3d 414, 419 (5th\nCir. 2004) (explaining that after the moving party meets it initial burden of showing no genuine issue\nof material fact remains, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to raise one by producing evidence\nor by pointing to specific facts).\n\n                                                 12\n\fdiscrimination, the City must also convince us that when Appellants\n\nwere denied employment between 2000 and 2002, lingering effects of\n\npast discrimination still necessitated a race-conscious remedy.\n\nSee Paradise, 480 U.S. at 169-70 (focusing repeatedly on whether\n\nany remaining effects of past discrimination still warranted a\n\nrace-conscious remedy); see also Police Ass’n, 100 F.3d 1168-69\n\n(same).   If the effects of past discrimination no longer existed\n\nwhen Appellants were denied employment, the City no longer had a\n\ncompelling interest to justify a race-conscious remedy.        See\n\nParadise, 480 U.S. at 169-70; see also Police Ass’n, 100 F.3d 1168-\n\n69. The district court in error focused solely on whether the City\n\nhad a compelling interest in 1980.   See Dean, slip op. at 13-15.\n\nThus, we must determine on appeal whether any effects of the City’s\n\npast discrimination still existed when Appellants were denied\n\nemployment, such that the City still had a compelling interest to\n\njustify its race-conscious remedy at that time.\n\n     Again, as mandated by Croson, 488 U.S. at 501-02, the relevant\n\nstatistical comparison is between the number of blacks in the\n\nCity’s fire department and the number of blacks qualified to\n\nundertake the particular task. Thus, in order to demonstrate that\n\nits remedy was still necessary between 2000 and 2002, the City had\n\nto show what percentage of its qualified applicant pool was black\n\nduring that time period.   The City did not do so.   The record is\n\nentirely inconsistent regarding this issue, and the district court\n\n\n\n                                13\n\ffailed to address it.\n\n       For example, Fire Chief Kelvin J. Cochran (“Chief Cochran”)\n\nwas asked in his deposition, “Do you know of any study or anything\n\nthat would indicate what the pool of available qualified applicants\n\nmight be blacks and women?”                    He responded, “No, ma’am.”                   Chief\n\nCochran was later asked, “To your knowledge, is there any kind of\n\nstudy available . . . that would give some information on what the\n\nactual demographics are for your fire district area or your hiring\n\narea?”      He again responded, “No, ma’am.”\n\n       Attempting to provide this crucial data, the City later hired\n\nan   expert      statistician         to    calculate        the    demographics         of    its\n\nqualified labor pool.7                The expert’s conclusions rested on the\n\nassumption that the percentage of blacks passing the Civil Service\n\nExam established the percentage of blacks in the qualified labor\n\npool.      We see numerous problems with this assumption, all of which\n\nwill require careful consideration on remand.\n\n       First, it is inappropriate to rely on an expert statistician\n\nwith a Ph.D. in Economics to determine what makes an applicant\n\nqualified to become a firefighter.                    The City, its fire department,\n\nor a vocational expert must make this determination.                             See Olson v.\n\nSchweiker, 663 F.2d 593, 596-97 (5th Cir. 1981) (using a vocational\n\n\n\n       7\n        The DOJ also attempted to determine whether a statistical disparity existed between the fire\ndepartment’s work force and its qualified labor pool. After an initial conclusion in 2002 that there\nwas no disparity, the DOJ later concluded it “lacked [the] essential data necessary to render a\ndetermination.” This illustrates the need for further factual development on remand.\n\n                                                14\n\fexpert to determine whether plaintiff was qualified for particular\n\npositions); see also New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner,\n\n661 F.2d 1031, 1035 (5th Cir. 1981) (same); Simons v. Sullivan, 915\n\nF.2d 1223, 1224 (8th Cir. 1990) (same); Noble v. Ala. Dep’t of\n\nEnvtl. Mgmt., 872 F.2d 361, 363 (11th Cir. 1989) (deferring to the\n\nstate agency when establishing what qualifications were required\n\nfor certain state positions). A statistician, after he is informed\n\nwhat a qualified applicant is, may then calculate the demographics\n\nof the qualified labor pool.     Second, the fire department itself\n\ncontradicts its own expert’s definition of a qualified applicant.\n\nThe expert defined qualified applicants as those having passed the\n\nCivil Service Exam. Yet the City maintains, and the district court\n\nstated in its ruling, “there is no evidence that persons with\n\nhigher passing scores make better fire[fighters] than those with\n\nlow passing scores.”   Dean, slip op. at 17.   We fail to understand\n\nhow passing scores conclusively establish the demographics of the\n\nqualified applicant pool if passing scores mean nothing with\n\nrespect to predicting the quality of future firefighters.       Third,\n\nlogic cuts against equating the percentage of blacks who pass the\n\nCivil Service Exam with the percentage of blacks in the qualified\n\nlabor   pool.   Equating   the   two   percentages   ignores   the   six\n\nsubsequent steps an applicant must successfully pass in order to\n\nbecome a firefighter, including: (1) an agility test; (2) a general\n\npreliminary interview, screening for disqualifying conduct, such as\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fdrug use; (3) a criminal background check; (4) a polygraph exam;\n\n(5) a psychological exam and interview; and (6) a medical exam.\n\nSurely, an applicant who receives a passing score but then fails\n\none of these requirements is not qualified.\n\n     On    remand,     the    City    must    properly     define    a   “qualified\n\napplicant.” It must then provide reliable statistical data showing\n\nthe percentages of blacks in its work force and in its qualified\n\nlabor pool between 2000 and 2002.             Only when the district court has\n\nthis information can it properly decide whether a sufficient\n\ndisparity still existed.         Until then, a genuine issue of material\n\nfact remains, thereby preventing a legal analysis of whether the\n\nCity’s race-conscious remedy was still necessary between 2000 and\n\n2002.     Although this alone requires us to reverse the district\n\ncourt’s     judgment    and    remand        the   case    for    further    factual\n\ndevelopment, we will also review the court’s narrow tailoring\n\nanalysis.\n\n            2. Narrow Tailoring\n\n     The    Supreme    Court    has    focused      on    the    following   factors\n\n(“Paradise factors”) when reviewing a race-conscious remedy to\n\nensure it is narrowly tailored: the necessity of the particular\n\nrelief and the efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility\n\nand duration of the relief, including the availability of waiver\n\nprovisions; the relationship between the numerical goal of the\n\nrelief and the relevant labor market; and the impact of the relief\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fon the rights of third parties.      See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171; see\n\nalso Black Fire Fighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d at 995.          Considering these\n\nfactors, it is clear that additional factual issues still remain,\n\nsuch that we cannot properly conduct a narrow tailoring analysis on\n\nthis record.   However, we briefly discuss each Paradise factor to\n\nhighlight   legal   errors   in    the    district   court’s   analysis   and\n\nspecific factual disputes that must be resolved on remand.\n\n                a. Necessity of the Particular Relief and Efficacy\n                   of Alternative Remedies\n\n     The district court concluded that the decree’s interim hiring\n\ngoal and the City’s hiring process were necessary remedies.               The\n\ncourt also decided that alternative remedies would have been\n\ninsufficient to remedy past discrimination.            For the same reason\n\nthat we cannot complete our compelling government interest analysis\n\nat   this   time--namely,    the     City’s    failure    to   explain    the\n\ndemographics of its qualified labor pool--we cannot properly review\n\nand weigh the first Paradise factor.             We will not be able to\n\ndetermine whether the remedies in this case were necessary between\n\n2000 and 2002, or whether alternative remedies would have sufficed,\n\nuntil we know what statistical disparity still existed at that\n\ntime, if one still existed at all, between the fire department’s\n\nwork force and its qualified labor pool.\n\n     However, before moving on to the next Paradise factor, we must\n\npoint out numerous legal errors in the district court’s analysis of\n\nthis factor. The court reasoned that “[t]he absolute lack of black\n\n\n                                     17\n\for female fire[fighters] prior to the institution of [the 1973]\n\nlitigation, followed by a lapse in minority hiring until . . . the\n\n[1980] consent decree,” made strong remedial measures necessary.\n\nSee Dean, slip op. at 16.            This may have been true in 1980.\n\nHowever, these events alone do not illustrate whether strong\n\nmeasures    were   still       necessary      when   Appellants   were      denied\n\nemployment.    To the extent the district court focused on whether\n\nthe remedies were necessary in 1980, instead of between 2000 and\n\n2002, it erred.     There is no legal basis for the conclusion that\n\nbecause a particular race-conscious remedy was necessary at one\n\npoint in time, it is still necessary two decades later.                        See\n\nParadise,   480    U.S.   at    171-72   (focusing     on   whether   the    race-\n\nconscious remedy was still necessary when plaintiffs were denied\n\npromotions); see also Police Ass’n, 100 F.3d 1169 (same).                       On\n\nremand, the City must show that the decree and hiring process were\n\nnecessary when Appellants were denied employment between 2000 and\n\n2002.\n\n     The district court similarly erred in its analysis of the\n\nefficacy of alternative remedies.             By focusing on the time leading\n\nup to the 1980 decree, the court could not have properly analyzed\n\nwhether alternative remedies would have sufficed when Appellants\n\nwere denied employment.         The fact that alternative measures would\n\nhave been insufficient in 1980 does not indicate whether they would\n\nhave been insufficient when Appellants were denied employment.                  On\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fremand, the City must show that race-neutral or less intrusive\n\nremedies would have been insufficient between 2000 and 2002.\n\n      In addition, the record is currently too inconsistent to\n\ndetermine what alternative remedies, if any, the City has already\n\nattempted and whether those or any others will suffice.                           For\n\nexample, one alternative to race-conscious hiring is increased\n\nrecruiting efforts targeting minorities.            In his deposition, Chief\n\nCochran    stated     that    when   the    City   recruits,    it     “does      not\n\nspecifically target black and female applicants.”              But in the same\n\ndeposition he stated that the City specifically targets blacks by\n\n“targeting the African-American churches.”              When asked whether the\n\nCity’s recruiting policy is adequately geared towards attracting\n\nminorities, Chief Cochran admitted, “the City has never done any\n\nkind of self-evaluation to see if its recruiting efforts are\n\nappropriate for recruiting minorities and women.”                      Thus, the\n\nefficacy   of   alternative      measures    remains     a   genuine      issue   of\n\nmaterial fact that must be resolved on remand.\n\n                    b. Flexibility and Duration\n\n      The district court found the decree and the hiring process\n\nadequately flexible.          The court also decided that their long\n\nduration did not preclude finding the remedies narrowly tailored.\n\n      The primary question when analyzing a remedy’s flexibility is\n\nwhether its requirements may be waived.            See Paradise, 480 U.S. at\n\n177   (focusing      its     flexibility     analysis     solely     on    whether\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\frequirements   could   be    waived).         If   they   may,    the   remedy   is\n\nadequately flexible.        See id.     The decree requires the City to\n\nadopt the long-term goal of achieving, subject to the availability\n\nof qualified applicants, the same proportions of blacks and women\n\nin its fire department “as blacks and women bear to the appropriate\n\nwork force in the particular jurisdiction.”               It also requires the\n\nCity to adopt an interim goal of hiring at least fifty percent\n\nblack and fifteen percent female employees until the long-term goal\n\nis achieved and maintained for one year.               The goal of the hiring\n\nprocess parallels the interim goal in the decree. While the decree\n\ndoes not allow the goals to be waived, it does specify that they\n\nare “subject to the availability of qualified applicants.”\n\n     Despite this explicit exception, Appellants argue that the\n\ndecree and hiring policy require a rigid fifty percent racial\n\nquota. The City, relying on the waiver provision, insists both are\n\nflexible.   The City also points out that since 1980, it has hired\n\nless than fifty percent black employees in all but two hiring\n\nclasses.    We agree with the district court that the remedies are\n\nadequately flexible.    We do so because the remedies here, as far as\n\ntheir flexibility is concerned, parallel the flexibility of the\n\nremedy in Paradise. In that case, the Alabama Department of Public\n\nSafety was required to award half of all state trooper promotions\n\nto black employees.      Paradise, 480 U.S. at 153.                However, the\n\nrequirement    was   contingent   on        the    availability    of   qualified\n\n\n\n                                       20\n\fcandidates.          Id. at 177.           This alone satisfied the flexibility\n\nrequirement.          Id. at 177-78.             Like the remedy in Paradise, the\n\nremedies here are contingent on the availability of qualified\n\napplicants and are therefore adequately flexible.\n\n       The central theme of a duration analysis is that the shorter\n\nthe life-span of the remedy, the more likely it is narrowly\n\ntailored.        See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 178.                     The City’s obligations\n\nunder the decree end when it achieves its long-term goal, that is,\n\nwhen the City achieves the same proportions of blacks and women in\n\nits fire department “as blacks and women bear to the appropriate\n\nwork force.”         In order to estimate when a particular goal might be\n\nachieved, the goal must be clear.                     Thus, here it must be clear what\n\nproportions “blacks and women bear to the appropriate work force.”\n\nDetermining this requires a precise definition of the phrase\n\n“appropriate         work     force.”          We     have     no    precise       definition.8\n\n\n\n       8\n          Contrary to Appellants’ contention, we did not define the “appropriate work force” in United\nStates v. City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir. 1980). However, we did state that the decree\n“established long term goals of achieving . . . the same percentages of blacks and women as are\npresent in the workforces in the various affected localities.” Id. at 1362. Appellants argue this\nstatement conclusively established the goal of the decree as achieving a percentage of blacks in the\nfire department equal to that in the general population. Appellants also insist we are now bound by\nthat statement. This would make the goal of the decree unconstitutional under Croson, 488 U.S. at\n501-02.\n          We disagree with Appellants for several reasons. First, by elevating the standard of review\nto strict scrutiny, Croson, 488 U.S. at 494, effectively overruled our holding in City of Alexandria.\nSecond, the definition of the phrase “appropriate work force” was not at issue in that case. See\ngenerally City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d at 1361-67. Third, our statement referring to “the\nworkforces,” id. at 1362, may have been shorthand for “the appropriate work forces,” to which the\nplain language of the decree refers. In any event, we are not bound today by our alleged\ninterpretation of the decree, or our subsequent approval of it, in City of Alexandria.\n\n                                                 21\n\fTherefore, the City’s goal remains unclear, and we cannot properly\n\nanalyze duration.\n\n     When interpreting a consent decree, general principles of\n\ncontract interpretation govern.             United States v. Chromalloy Am.\n\nCorp., 158 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir. 1998).             We begin by looking to\n\nthe “four corners” of the decree.            Id. at 350.     We will then look\n\nto extrinsic evidence if the decree is ambiguous.                N. Shore Lab.\n\nCorp. v. Cohen, 721 F.2d 514, 519 (5th Cir. 1983).                A decree “is\n\nambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one\n\nmeaning, in light of surrounding circumstances and established\n\nrules of construction.”        Id.\n\n     We find the phrase “appropriate work force” ambiguous as a\n\nmatter of law.      The decree itself sheds no light on what the\n\nadjective “appropriate” means in this context.               Because we cannot\n\ndecipher its meaning within the four corners of the decree, we need\n\nextrinsic evidence to aid our interpretation.               We have none.      For\n\nexample, we have no preliminary drafts of the consent decree or\n\ncorrespondence     between     the   parties    during      negotiations.   This\n\nevidence   would   help   us    determine      what   the    parties   meant   by\n\n“appropriate work force.”        Without extrinsic evidence, we have no\n\nreason to choose one possible definition over another. Because the\n\nphrase “appropriate work force” was not defined by the district\n\ncourt, and because we are unable to do so without extrinsic\n\nevidence, the issue must be resolved on remand.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f       We also stress that regardless of the outcome of the issue on\n\nremand, the duration component of this Paradise factor will favor\n\nAppellants, at least to some degree. The durations of the remedies\n\nin this case are breathtakingly long in comparison to others we\n\nhave reviewed.9              Edwards v. City of Houston, 78 F.3d 983, 1002\n\n(5th Cir. 1996) (en banc), involved a consent decree that allowed\n\na   police      department         to    promote       a   certain       number      of   minority\n\nofficers to sergeant and lieutenant.10                         The remedy was to last no\n\nlonger than five years.                 Id.   In Black Fire Fighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d\n\nat 997, we struck down a consent decree that allowed a fire\n\ndepartment to promote a certain number of minorities to higher\n\nranking positions. We found the remedy not to be narrowly tailored\n\neven though it lasted for only three years.                                 Id.      Finally, in\n\nPolice Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1173, we again struck down a race-\n\nconscious promotional plan. We found the remedy not to be narrowly\n\ntailored even though it was a one-time set of promotions, not an\n\nongoing plan.          Id. at 1169.\n\n       Therefore, the durations of the remedies in this case are\n\nalready considerably longer than those in any of our previous\n\ncases.         Thus,      this     factor       will       weigh    in     Appellants’         favor\n\n\n       9\n        In the midst of this litigation in 2004, the City changed its hiring process. Nevertheless, we\ncannot ignore the fact that when Appellants’ claims arose, the process had been used for over twenty\nyears. The decree had been in effect for just as long, and continues to this day.\n       10\n          Although we did not reach the merits regarding the consent decree’s constitutionality in\nEdwards, we refer to the case to illustrate just how long the durations of the remedies in this case are\nin relation to others we have been confronted with in the past.\n\n                                                  23\n\fregardless of how soon the district court determines the remedies\n\nmight end.    We point this out only to emphasize that in order for\n\nthese remedies to be upheld on remand, other Paradise factors must\n\nstrongly suggest they are narrowly tailored.\n\n      On remand, the district court must determine, using extrinsic\n\nevidence, the decree’s precise long-term goal by defining the\n\n“appropriate work force.”         It must then estimate how long it will\n\ntake for the City to achieve that goal.                   When an approximate end\n\ndate is known, the district court can then re-weigh the duration\n\nfactor,    keeping   in    mind    the        past   precedent     we     have    just\n\nhighlighted.\n\n                  c. Relationship Between the Numerical Goal and the\n                     Relevant Labor Market\n\n      The district court conducted no meaningful analysis of this\n\nfactor.    Nor could it have.        The long-term numerical goal of a\n\nrace-conscious remedy must be closely tied to the relevant labor\n\nmarket.    See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 179.                  To weigh this factor,\n\ncommon sense demands we first know the remedy’s numerical goal and\n\nthe relevant labor market.        As discussed above, we know neither.\n\n      Croson mandates the number of minorities in the relevant labor\n\nmarket be determined by the “number of minorities qualified to\n\nundertake the particular task.”               Croson, 488 U.S. at 502.           As we\n\npointed out first in our compelling interest analysis, and again in\n\nthe   necessity   and     efficacy   portion         of    our   narrow    tailoring\n\nanalysis, the City has not provided us with the demographics of its\n\n\n                                         24\n\fqualified applicant pool. Therefore, we cannot properly define the\n\n“relevant labor market.” This alone prevents us from reviewing and\n\nweighing this factor.            Further, as discussed in our duration\n\nanalysis, the long-term goal of the decree is unclear.                   Until we\n\nknow the numerical goal of the decree and the relevant labor\n\nmarket,    the   relationship      between    the    numerical   goal    and   the\n\nrelevant labor market remains a genuine issue of material fact to\n\nbe resolved on remand.\n\n                   d. Impact of the Relief on Third Parties\n\n      The final Paradise factor ensures a remedy does “not impose\n\nan unacceptable burden on innocent third parties.”                Paradise, 480\n\nU.S. at 182.     The district court found the impact on third parties\n\n“not overly significant” in this case.              See Dean, slip op. at 18.\n\nThe Supreme Court has given little guidance on this factor, but has\n\nmade a few things clear.          First, remedies requiring nonminorities\n\nto be fired impose a severe, and possibly unacceptable, burden on\n\nthird parties.     Paradise, 480 U.S. at 182.          Hiring preferences are\n\nless burdensome.        See id.    Second, remedies allowing unqualified\n\nminorities to be hired are likely not narrowly tailored.                  See id.\n\nat 183.     Third, remedies merely postponing a benefit to third\n\nparties    are   less   burdensome    than    ones     permanently     denying   a\n\nbenefit.    See id.\n\n     We    agree    with   the     district    court     that    the    impact on\n\nnonminorities is not significant enough to make the decree and\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\fhiring policy unconstitutional per se.                 We do so because the\n\nremedies in this case have all three characteristics the Supreme\n\nCourt has previously said favor a finding of narrow tailoring\n\nwithin   the   context    of   this   factor:    (1)   they   do   not   require\n\nnonminorities to be fired; (2) they do not require unqualified\n\nminorities to be hired; and (3) they do not pose an absolute bar to\n\nnonminority employment. Paradise, 480 U.S. at 182-83. This factor\n\nalone does not prevent a finding of narrow tailoring.\n\n      In sum, the district court on remand must develop the record\n\nfurther and re-evaluate both whether the decree and the hiring\n\nprocess were still justified at the time of suit by a compelling\n\ngovernment interest and whether they were narrowly tailored to\n\nfurther that interest.\n\nIII. Appellants’ Title VII Claim\n\n      Appellants also argue that the City’s hiring process violates\n\nTitle VII. Specifically, Appellants refer us to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(l), which was added to Title VII in 1991 and provides that “[i]t\n\nshall be an unlawful employment practice . . . in connection with\n\nthe   selection   or     referral     of    applicants   or   candidates    for\n\nemployment . . . to adjust the scores of, use different cutoff\n\nscores for, or otherwise alter the results of, employment related\n\ntests on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.” § 2000e-2(l) (emphasis added)            Appellants claim that by\n\nseparating applicants’ Civil Service Exam scores by race, the City\n\n\n                                       26\n\fin effect uses different cutoff scores on the basis of race.    We\n\nagree that the City’s hiring process violates the plain language of\n\nsection 2000e-2(l).\n\n      First, we must point out that our decision that the City’s\n\nhiring process violates section 2000e-2(l) will stand even if on\n\nremand the district court finds that the hiring process passes\n\nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.   That is, even if the\n\nprocess is “upheld as a valid method of affirmative action,”\n\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. City of Chicago, 249 F.3d 649, 656\n\n(7th Cir. 2001), it nevertheless violates the specific prohibitions\n\nof section 2000e-2(l).   See id. (recognizing that the practice of\n\n“banding” test scores is an acceptable form of affirmative action\n\nunder other Title VII provisions and the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nbut continuing on to determine whether that practice violated\n\nsection 2000e-2(l)).\n\n      Appellants insist that the City violates section 2000e-2(l)\n\nwhen, pursuant to its hiring policy, it ranks test takers from\n\nhighest to lowest exam score, but then separates those scores\n\naccording to race and sex.    The City responds, and the district\n\ncourt held, that the hiring process does not violate the statute\n\nbecause “[e]very applicant, black or white, ha[s] to score at least\n\na seventy-five to pass the Civil Service Exam.”   Dean, slip op. at\n\n20.   This conclusion is incomplete, however, because it focuses\n\nonly on the initial portion of phase one of the City’s hiring\n\n\n                                27\n\fprocess instead of on the entire process.        The City is correct that\n\nall applicants are subject to the same initial requirement at phase\n\none -- a score of at least seventy-five on the Civil Service Exam.\n\nOur analysis, however, cannot stop there because the City uses the\n\ntest scores again at another important step in the hiring process.\n\nA passing score of seventy-five only makes applicants eligible for\n\nfurther consideration.      Later in the process the City again uses\n\nthe exam scores to choose which applicants will proceed to phase\n\ntwo of the hiring process.         The City separates applicants’ exam\n\nscores by race and sex and selects the same number of blacks and\n\nwhites to proceed, starting with the highest exam score on each\n\nsegregated list.\n\n      This method of selection between phase one and phase two\n\nviolates the plain language of section 2000e-2(l) because it has\n\nthe practical effect of requiring different cutoff scores, based\n\nsolely on race and sex, for continuing further in the hiring\n\nprocess.   We see no reason to ignore a clear violation of section\n\n2000e-2(l) between phase one and phase two simply because at the\n\noutset of phase one the same cutoff score is required of all\n\napplicants.    Compliance with section 2000e-2(l) is required at all\n\ntimes during employment activities carried out “in connection with\n\nthe   selection    or   referral   of     applicants   or   candidates   for\n\nemployment.”      See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(l).\n\n      We find that the City’s hiring process violates Title VII.\n\n\n                                     28\n\fTherefore, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of Appellants’\n\nTitle VII claim.\n\nIV. Appellants’ Louisiana Constitutional Claim\n\n     Appellants’ next contention is that the City’s hiring process\n\nviolates the Louisiana Constitution.               Appellants point to Article\n\nI, Section 3, which states not only that “[n]o person shall be\n\ndenied the equal protection of the Laws,” but also that “[n]o law\n\nshall discriminate against a person because of race.” The district\n\ncourt, after determining that the City’s hiring process survived\n\nscrutiny under the United States Constitution, held that regardless\n\nof whether the hiring process violates the Louisiana Constitution,\n\n“Louisiana law must bow to federal law, which is the supreme law of\n\nthe land.”    Dean, slip op. at 21.                On appeal, the City simply\n\nstates that even if its hiring process violates the Louisiana\n\nConstitution, the consent decree shields the City from liability\n\nbecause it “preempts state law.”              We disagree and find that the\n\ndistrict court erred in determining that preemption affords the\n\nCity any form of protection from possible violations of state law.\n\n     Clearly,      had   the    City   been    required   by       federal    law   to\n\nimplement    its    hiring      process       to    redress    a     past    federal\n\nconstitutional violation, federal law would preempt the Louisiana\n\nConstitution.        See   In    re    Birmingham      Reverse      Discrimination\n\nEmployment Litig., 833 F.2d 1492, 1501 (11th Cir. 1987).                     But that\n\nis not the situation we face here.            The City originally denied that\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fit had engaged in intentional discrimination and was not found to\n\nbe   in     violation   of    the     United    States   Constitution.      More\n\nimportantly, the City was never ordered by a federal court, nor\n\nmandated by any other federal law, to enter into the consent\n\ndecree.     Rather, the City did so voluntarily.             Thus, in the eyes of\n\nthe law the City’s hiring process is nothing more than a voluntary\n\naffirmative action program.\n\n      As the Eleventh Circuit has stated:\n\n      We perceive no reason for treating a consent decree\n      entered pursuant to a voluntary settlement differently\n      from a voluntary affirmative action plan.        In both\n      instances, the employer has embarked on a voluntary\n      undertaking;    we   reject    any   notion    that   the\n      memorialization of that voluntary undertaking in the form\n      of a consent decree somehow provides the employer with\n      extra    protection    against    charges   of    illegal\n      discrimination . . . .     It should be emphasized that\n      there has been no judicial determination that the City is\n      liable for past discrimination . . . . Thus . . . we are\n      not presented with a case in which the defendant was\n      required by law to implement an affirmative action\n      program designed to remedy the effects of past\n      discrimination.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 833 F.2d\n\nat   1501    (11th   Cir.    1987).      We    think   the   Eleventh   Circuit’s\n\nreasoning is sound. As far as preemption is concerned, a voluntary\n\nconsent decree has the same effect on state law as does a voluntary\n\naffirmative action program--none.\n\n      Therefore, we need only decide whether the City’s practice of\n\nseparating applicants by race during its hiring process violates\n\nthe Louisiana Constitution.           We think it is beyond dispute that it\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\fdoes.   Decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana bind us with\n\nregard to the meaning of Louisiana constitutional provisions.\n\nThose decisions make abundantly clear that Article I, Section 3 of\n\nthe Louisiana Constitution provides far greater protection against\n\nracial discrimination than does its federal counterpart.                       See,\n\ne.g., La. Associated Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. State, 669 So. 2d\n\n1185, 1196 (La. 1996).        Under the United States Constitution,\n\nclassifications based on race are permissible if they are narrowly\n\ntailored to serve a compelling government interest.                  See Paradise,\n\n480 U.S. at 166-67.       However, under the Louisiana Constitution,\n\nclassifications based on race “shall be repudiated completely,\n\nregardless of the justification.” La. Associated Gen. Contractors,\n\nInc., 669 So. 2d at 1198.            Under Louisiana law, once it is\n\ndetermined that a classification based on race has been drawn, the\n\ninquiry is over--Article I, Section 3 of the Louisiana Constitution\n\nhas been violated.        See id.        Here, the City’s hiring process\n\nunquestionably classifies according to race.                  The City separates\n\nwhite   and   black   firefighter        applicants         when   deciding   which\n\napplicants will proceed to phase two of the hiring process.                    The\n\nCity’s actions violate Article I, Section 3 of the Louisiana\n\nConstitution.     Also,    even     if        on   remand    the   district   court\n\ndetermines that the consent decree survives strict scrutiny under\n\nthe United States Constitution, an outcome which is far from\n\ncertain, the Louisiana Constitution is not preempted because the\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fdecree was entered into voluntarily.       Therefore, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of Appellants’ Louisiana constitutional\n\nclaim.\n\nV. Appellants’ Louisiana Statutory Claim\n\n     Appellants’ final argument is that the City’s hiring process\n\nviolates    a   Louisiana   anti-discrimination   employment   statute.\n\nAppellants note that LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 23:332(A)(2) (1998)   makes\n\nit unlawful for employers in Louisiana to “[i]ntentionally limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify . . . employees or applicants . . . in any\n\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status\n\nas an employee, because of the individual’s race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.”\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nCity dismissing this claim.      We agree with the court’s ruling on\n\nthis claim because Appellants’ argument is foreclosed by the plain\n\nlanguage of another subsection of the statute they rely upon, which\n\nprovides that “[n]othing contained in [section 23:332] shall be\n\nconstrued so as to create a cause of action against an employer .\n\n. . for employment practices pursuant to any affirmative action\n\nplan.”     LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 23:332(G) (emphasis added).       The\n\nstatute make no distinction between valid and invalid affirmative\n\naction plans.     See id.   Therefore, regardless of the outcome on\n\nremand of Appellants’ remaining claim, the City’s practice of\n\n\n                                   32\n\fclassifying applicants according to race and sex does not violate\n\nthis   statute.   We   affirm    the     district   court’s   dismissal   of\n\nAppellants’ Louisiana statutory claim.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ndismissal of Appellants’ Louisiana statutory claim; we REVERSE its\n\ndismissal of Appellants’ equal protection claim and REMAND the case\n\nfor further factual development of the equal protection claim; and\n\nwe REVERSE its dismissal of Appellants’ Title VII and Louisiana\n\nconstitutional claims, and with respect to the Title VII and\n\nLouisiana constitutional claims, we REMAND the case for further\n\nproceedings concerning the entitlement of each individual Appellant\n\nto relief.\n\nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; and REMANDED for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f",

At the time Appellants\n\fapplied, the City used a hiring process that placed applicants into\n\nseparate lists according to race and sex.                           The City created its\n\nrace-conscious hiring process in an attempt to comply with a 1980\n\nconsent decree drafted to end discriminatory hiring practices in\n\nthe City’s fire department and to remedy the effects of past\n\ndiscrimination.            Appellants challenge both the decree and the\n\nhiring process.\n\n                                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In 1977, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a\n\nlawsuit against the City alleging its fire department used racially\n\nand sexually discriminatory hiring practices.                                To settle the\n\nlawsuit, the City signed a proposed consent decree providing a plan\n\nto end then-current discriminatory practices and remedy the effects\n\nof past discrimination.                Although the City signed the decree, it\n\ndid not admit to any unlawful discrimination.                             Because the City\n\ndeclined to admit to unlawful discrimination, the district court\n\ninitially refused to enter the decree.                        United States v.

Croson Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n                                                 <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f       To remedy the effects of past discrimination, the decree sets\n\nforth a long-term goal that the City achieve – subject to the\n\navailability of qualified applicants – the same proportions of\n\nblacks and women in its fire department “as blacks and women bear\n\nto the appropriate work force in the particular jurisdiction.”2\n\nHowever, the decree does not define “appropriate work force.”                                    The\n\ndecree also requires the City to adopt an interim hiring goal of\n\nfilling at least fifty percent of all firefighter vacancies with\n\nqualified black applicants and at least fifteen percent with\n\nqualified female applicants.                    The interim goal remains in effect\n\nuntil the long-term goal is achieved and maintained for one year.\n\n       The decree itself does not mandate any particular hiring\n\nprocess for meeting its goals.                   Therefore, the City formed its own\n\nprocess.3        Phase one requires all firefighter applicants to take\n\nthe Civil Service Exam.               To pass, an applicant needs a score of at\n\n\n\n469, 493-94 (1989). Thus, as we re-evaluate the decree under strict scrutiny, we are not bound by\nour prior approval of it under the rational basis standard.\n       2\n        The decree is published as an appendix to City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d at 1367-72.\n       3\n          The City’s hiring process remained substantially the same from the time the decree was\nentered until Appellants were denied employment between 2000 and 2002. In 2004, the City changed\nits hiring process. The City claims it continues to strive toward the interim and long-term goals in\nthe decree, but that its new hiring process is race-neutral. Much to this Court’s dissatisfaction, the\nCity has kept secret the details of its new hiring process. In addition, the City has failed to explain\nhow it expects its new allegedly race-neutral hiring process to meet the goals of the decree when its\nold race-conscious process apparently did not. In any event, we limit our analysis to the hiring\nprocess the City used at the time Appellants were denied employment because it is that process\nAppellants argue violated their rights. We refer to the City’s old hiring process in the present tense\nin our opinion purely to avoid continuous, and possibly confusing, tense changes.\n\n                                                  3\n\fleast seventy-five.     Points are then added to the scores of\n\napplicants with prior emergency medical or paramedic training or\n\nmilitary service.   When the final numerical scores are calculated,\n\nthe applicants are separated into three lists: a white male list,\n\na black male list, and a female list.   Each list is ranked by exam\n\nscore from highest to lowest.   The City then determines how many\n\nfirefighter positions it needs to fill. Finally, starting with the\n\nhighest exam score on each list, the City selects approximately\n\ntwice as many applicants as vacant spots to proceed to phase two of\n\nthe hiring process. Of those selected to proceed, fifty percent of\n\nthe males are white and fifty percent are black.   Every female who\n\nreceives a seventy-five on the exam usually proceeds to phase two\n\nbecause of the extremely low number of female applicants.\n\n     Phase two includes six additional steps an applicant must pass\n\nto become a firefighter: (1) an agility test; (2) a general\n\npreliminary interview, screening for disqualifying conduct, such as\n\ndrug use; (3) a criminal background check; (4) a polygraph exam;\n\n(5) a psychological exam and interview; and (6) a medical exam.   An\n\napplicant who fails any step is immediately denied employment.    An\n\napplicant who passes each step is immediately awarded employment.\n\n     Under this hiring process, Appellants’ exam scores in phase\n\none were too low on the white male list to proceed to phase two.\n\n                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     In October 2000, Appellant Jeffery Todd Dean (“Dean”), an\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\funsuccessful white male applicant, sued the City under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983, alleging the decree and the hiring process violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                           Dean and the City\n\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment.                           In 2002, during the\n\npendency of those motions, eight additional white male applicants\n\nbrought similar discrimination suits against the City. In addition\n\nto Dean’s equal protection claim, they asserted claims under Title\n\nVII,       the    Louisiana         Constitution,          and      a     Louisiana        anti-\n\ndiscrimination employment statute.4                       The cases were consolidated\n\nwith Dean’s, and all eight joined his pending motion for summary\n\njudgment.        All parties stipulated to proceed before a magistrate\n\njudge.      In October 2004, the magistrate judge denied Dean’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment and granted the City’s, dismissing all claims\n\nagainst the City.           This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\nI.

However, a general\n\nassertion of past societal discrimination is insufficient.           See\n\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 499.    Rather, the government must justify its\n\naction with a showing of past discrimination by the governmental\n\nunit seeking to use the race-conscious remedy.      See id. at 495-97;\n\nsee also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276 (1986);\n\nPolice Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1168.\n\n     The Supreme Court has offered little guidance as to how much\n\nevidence of   past   discrimination    is   required.   Id.     However,\n\n“[t]here is no doubt that ‘[w]here gross statistical disparities\n\ncan be shown, they alone in a proper case may constitute prima\n\nfacie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.’”        Croson,\n\n488 U.S. at 501 (alteration in original) (quoting Hazelwood Sch.\n\nDist. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109724\"><a href=\"/opinion/109724/hazelwood-school-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307-08 (1977)).      The relevant\n\nstatistical comparison is between the number of minorities in the\n\n\n                                   7\n\fwork force of the governmental unit and “the number of minorities\n\nqualified to undertake the particular task.”          See Croson, 488 U.S.\n\nat 502.\n\n     Appellants argue that even in 1980, the City had no compelling\n\ninterest to justify the decree or a race-conscious hiring process.\n\nAppellants point out that the decree is not based on any formal\n\nfactual finding of past discrimination. Further, the City’s hiring\n\nprocess was adopted solely to comply with the goals of the decree.\n\nAppellants urge us to hold that a governmental unit may use a race-\n\nconscious remedy only after a formal judicial, legislative, or\n\nadministrative finding of past discrimination.         The City maintains\n\nthat in 1980 it clearly had a compelling interest.                The City\n\nconcedes that a formal finding of past discrimination was never\n\nmade, but insists that one was not required.\n\n     We agree with the City.       Nothing in Supreme Court or Fifth\n\nCircuit precedent   compels   us   to   require   a    formal   finding   of\n\ndiscrimination prior to the use of a race-conscious remedy.         To the\n\ncontrary, in Police Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1167-68, we stated that\n\n“Croson does not require a city to incriminate itself by proving\n\nits own participation in past discrimination.”              It is when a\n\nremedial program is challenged that a trial court must make a\n\nfactual determination that there was a strong basis in evidence for\n\nthe conclusion that remedial action was necessary.          Thus, what we\n\nmeant in Police Ass’n was that the government need not incriminate\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\fitself with a formal finding of discrimination prior to using a\n\nrace-conscious remedy, but if the remedy is later challenged, a\n\ncourt must determine there was a strong evidentiary basis for its\n\nenactment.       This approach is consistent with pre-Croson Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.          See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (explaining that\n\n“[e]videntiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is\n\nwarranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is challenged\n\nin court by nonminorit[ies]” (emphasis added)); see also id. at 289\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing that “a contemporaneous or\n\nantecedent   finding       of     past   discrimination       .    .   .   is    not   a\n\nconstitutional prerequisite . . . to an affirmative action plan”\n\n(emphasis added)).          This approach is also in line with other\n\ncircuits that have addressed the issue.               See, e.g., Aiken v.

Thus, to the\n\nextent our prior decisions were unclear, we now clarify that when\n\na governmental unit employs a race-conscious remedy, it need not\n\nhave   already     made    a    formal   finding      of    past   discrimination.\n\nNevertheless, if the remedy is later challenged, the reviewing\n\n\n                                          9\n\fcourt must ensure there was strong evidence of past discrimination\n\nwarranting the remedy.               We turn now to whether strong evidence of\n\ndiscrimination existed in this case, such that in 1980 the City had\n\na compelling interest in remedying it.\n\n       The district court concluded that the City made an adequate\n\nshowing of past discrimination.                       We agree.          Prior to 1974, the\n\nCity’s fire department had never hired a black employee.                             In 1974,\n\nafter       it   was     sued       by    black       applicants         alleging    racially\n\ndiscriminatory          hiring       practices,         the    City      hired   three   black\n\nfirefighters.          After the lawsuit was settled, the City hired no\n\nblack employees in 1975, just one black firefighter in 1976, and no\n\nblack employees in 1977.                   In 1977, another lawsuit was brought\n\nagainst the City, this time by the DOJ, alleging racially and\n\nsexually discriminatory hiring practices.                           In the time between the\n\n1977       lawsuit     and    the    1980      decree,        the    City    hired   only   six\n\nadditional black firefighters.                    Thus, when the decree was entered\n\nto settle the DOJ lawsuit, only 10 of the City’s 270 firefighters\n\nwere black.5           At that time, blacks accounted for approximately\n\nforty percent of the general population in the City of Shreveport.\n\nFurther, the City now admits it systematically excluded all black\n\napplicants prior to 1974 and hired the few it did between 1974 and\n\n1980 in response to pending lawsuits.                         Appellants do not contest\n\nthese statistics and offer no alternative explanation for them,\n\n\n       5\n        By 1980, the City still had not hired a single female firefighter.\n\n                                                 10\n\fexpert or otherwise.\n\n      We recognize that the relevant comparison when determining\n\nwhether discrimination existed is between the number of black\n\nfirefighters in the City’s fire department and the “number of\n\n[blacks] qualified to undertake the particular task,”             see Croson,\n\n488   U.S.   at   502,   not   the   number   of   blacks   in   the   general\n\npopulation, see id.        We are also aware that the City has not\n\npresented a precise calculation of how many black applicants were\n\nqualified to become firefighters in the years leading up to the\n\n1980 decree.      Nevertheless, we find it inconceivable that the\n\nnumber of qualified blacks was an “emphatic zero.”               See Dean v.\n\nCity of Shreveport, No. 00-2372, slip op. at 14 (W.D. La.

See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 501-02 (finding no\n\ncompelling interest in remedying past discrimination because the\n\ngovernment failed to show how many minorities in the relevant\n\nmarket were qualified to undertake the particular task).                But in\n\nrare cases, the statistical disparity may be so great between a\n\n\n\n                                      11\n\fparticular work force and the general population that, along with\n\nother overwhelming evidence, it may provide us with an adequate\n\nbasis to conclude no genuine factual issue remains regarding the\n\nexistence of past discrimination.\n\n       This is such a case.                 In addition to the fact that the City\n\nhired      no    black     employees         prior         to   1974    and   only     10    black\n\nfirefighters as of 1980, the overwhelming evidence shows that (1)\n\nthe City now admits that for over 100 years it systematically\n\nexcluded all minorities from its fire department; (2) the City has\n\nbeen sued numerous times for racial and sexual discrimination; and\n\n(3) Appellants have failed to offer any alternative explanation,\n\nexpert      or     otherwise,         for     the      gross      statistical        disparity.\n\nTherefore, the district court properly concluded that the City had\n\na   compelling        interest       in     1980      to    enter      into   the    decree     and\n\nimplement a race-conscious hiring process.6\n\n       The City argues that this conclusion ends our compelling\n\ninterest inquiry.               We disagree.               In addition to showing past\n\n\n\n       6\n         Again, we do not intend to suggest a statistical disparity between a work force and the\ngeneral population, without additional overwhelming evidence, is enough to show past discrimination.\nHad the City not admitted to systematically excluding blacks from its work force and twice previously\nbeen sued for racial discrimination, our decision today might have been different. See Paradise, 480\nU.S. at 169 (taking into account that the governmental unit systematically excluded minorities and\nhad previously faced numerous allegations of racial discrimination). Similarly, our decision might\nhave been different had Appellants rebutted the City’s evidence or offered an alternative explanation,\nthereby raising some genuine factual issue. See Priester v.

See Dean, slip op. at 13-15.\n\nThus, we must determine on appeal whether any effects of the City’s\n\npast discrimination still existed when Appellants were denied\n\nemployment, such that the City still had a compelling interest to\n\njustify its race-conscious remedy at that time.\n\n     Again, as mandated by Croson, 488 U.S. at 501-02, the relevant\n\nstatistical comparison is between the number of blacks in the\n\nCity’s fire department and the number of blacks qualified to\n\nundertake the particular task. Thus, in order to demonstrate that\n\nits remedy was still necessary between 2000 and 2002, the City had\n\nto show what percentage of its qualified applicant pool was black\n\nduring that time period.   The City did not do so.   The record is\n\nentirely inconsistent regarding this issue, and the district court\n\n\n\n                                13\n\ffailed to address it.\n\n       For example, Fire Chief Kelvin J. Cochran (“Chief Cochran”)\n\nwas asked in his deposition, “Do you know of any study or anything\n\nthat would indicate what the pool of available qualified applicants\n\nmight be blacks and women?”                    He responded, “No, ma’am.”                   Chief\n\nCochran was later asked, “To your knowledge, is there any kind of\n\nstudy available . . . that would give some information on what the\n\nactual demographics are for your fire district area or your hiring\n\narea?”      He again responded, “No, ma’am.”\n\n       Attempting to provide this crucial data, the City later hired\n\nan   expert      statistician         to    calculate        the    demographics         of    its\n\nqualified labor pool.7                The expert’s conclusions rested on the\n\nassumption that the percentage of blacks passing the Civil Service\n\nExam established the percentage of blacks in the qualified labor\n\npool.      We see numerous problems with this assumption, all of which\n\nwill require careful consideration on remand.\n\n       First, it is inappropriate to rely on an expert statistician\n\nwith a Ph.D. in Economics to determine what makes an applicant\n\nqualified to become a firefighter.                    The City, its fire department,\n\nor a vocational expert must make this determination.

A statistician, after he is informed\n\nwhat a qualified applicant is, may then calculate the demographics\n\nof the qualified labor pool.     Second, the fire department itself\n\ncontradicts its own expert’s definition of a qualified applicant.\n\nThe expert defined qualified applicants as those having passed the\n\nCivil Service Exam. Yet the City maintains, and the district court\n\nstated in its ruling, “there is no evidence that persons with\n\nhigher passing scores make better fire[fighters] than those with\n\nlow passing scores.”   Dean, slip op. at 17.   We fail to understand\n\nhow passing scores conclusively establish the demographics of the\n\nqualified applicant pool if passing scores mean nothing with\n\nrespect to predicting the quality of future firefighters.       Third,\n\nlogic cuts against equating the percentage of blacks who pass the\n\nCivil Service Exam with the percentage of blacks in the qualified\n\nlabor   pool.   Equating   the   two   percentages   ignores   the   six\n\nsubsequent steps an applicant must successfully pass in order to\n\nbecome a firefighter, including: (1) an agility test; (2) a general\n\npreliminary interview, screening for disqualifying conduct, such as\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fdrug use; (3) a criminal background check; (4) a polygraph exam;\n\n(5) a psychological exam and interview; and (6) a medical exam.\n\nSurely, an applicant who receives a passing score but then fails\n\none of these requirements is not qualified.\n\n     On    remand,     the    City    must    properly     define    a   “qualified\n\napplicant.” It must then provide reliable statistical data showing\n\nthe percentages of blacks in its work force and in its qualified\n\nlabor pool between 2000 and 2002.             Only when the district court has\n\nthis information can it properly decide whether a sufficient\n\ndisparity still existed.         Until then, a genuine issue of material\n\nfact remains, thereby preventing a legal analysis of whether the\n\nCity’s race-conscious remedy was still necessary between 2000 and\n\n2002.     Although this alone requires us to reverse the district\n\ncourt’s     judgment    and    remand        the   case    for    further    factual\n\ndevelopment, we will also review the court’s narrow tailoring\n\nanalysis.\n\n            2. Narrow Tailoring\n\n     The    Supreme    Court    has    focused      on    the    following   factors\n\n(“Paradise factors”) when reviewing a race-conscious remedy to\n\nensure it is narrowly tailored: the necessity of the particular\n\nrelief and the efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility\n\nand duration of the relief, including the availability of waiver\n\nprovisions; the relationship between the numerical goal of the\n\nrelief and the relevant labor market; and the impact of the relief\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fon the rights of third parties.      See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171; see\n\nalso Black Fire Fighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d at 995.          Considering these\n\nfactors, it is clear that additional factual issues still remain,\n\nsuch that we cannot properly conduct a narrow tailoring analysis on\n\nthis record.   However, we briefly discuss each Paradise factor to\n\nhighlight   legal   errors   in    the    district   court’s   analysis   and\n\nspecific factual disputes that must be resolved on remand.\n\n                a. Necessity of the Particular Relief and Efficacy\n                   of Alternative Remedies\n\n     The district court concluded that the decree’s interim hiring\n\ngoal and the City’s hiring process were necessary remedies.               The\n\ncourt also decided that alternative remedies would have been\n\ninsufficient to remedy past discrimination.            For the same reason\n\nthat we cannot complete our compelling government interest analysis\n\nat   this   time--namely,    the     City’s    failure    to   explain    the\n\ndemographics of its qualified labor pool--we cannot properly review\n\nand weigh the first Paradise factor.             We will not be able to\n\ndetermine whether the remedies in this case were necessary between\n\n2000 and 2002, or whether alternative remedies would have sufficed,\n\nuntil we know what statistical disparity still existed at that\n\ntime, if one still existed at all, between the fire department’s\n\nwork force and its qualified labor pool.\n\n     However, before moving on to the next Paradise factor, we must\n\npoint out numerous legal errors in the district court’s analysis of\n\nthis factor. The court reasoned that “[t]he absolute lack of black\n\n\n                                     17\n\for female fire[fighters] prior to the institution of [the 1973]\n\nlitigation, followed by a lapse in minority hiring until . . . the\n\n[1980] consent decree,” made strong remedial measures necessary.\n\nSee Dean, slip op. at 16.            This may have been true in 1980.\n\nHowever, these events alone do not illustrate whether strong\n\nmeasures    were   still       necessary      when   Appellants   were      denied\n\nemployment.    To the extent the district court focused on whether\n\nthe remedies were necessary in 1980, instead of between 2000 and\n\n2002, it erred.     There is no legal basis for the conclusion that\n\nbecause a particular race-conscious remedy was necessary at one\n\npoint in time, it is still necessary two decades later.                        See\n\nParadise,   480    U.S.   at    171-72   (focusing     on   whether   the    race-\n\nconscious remedy was still necessary when plaintiffs were denied\n\npromotions); see also Police Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (same).                       On\n\nremand, the City must show that the decree and hiring process were\n\nnecessary when Appellants were denied employment between 2000 and\n\n2002.\n\n     The district court similarly erred in its analysis of the\n\nefficacy of alternative remedies.             By focusing on the time leading\n\nup to the 1980 decree, the court could not have properly analyzed\n\nwhether alternative remedies would have sufficed when Appellants\n\nwere denied employment.         The fact that alternative measures would\n\nhave been insufficient in 1980 does not indicate whether they would\n\nhave been insufficient when Appellants were denied employment.                  On\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fremand, the City must show that race-neutral or less intrusive\n\nremedies would have been insufficient between 2000 and 2002.\n\n      In addition, the record is currently too inconsistent to\n\ndetermine what alternative remedies, if any, the City has already\n\nattempted and whether those or any others will suffice.                           For\n\nexample, one alternative to race-conscious hiring is increased\n\nrecruiting efforts targeting minorities.            In his deposition, Chief\n\nCochran    stated     that    when   the    City   recruits,    it     “does      not\n\nspecifically target black and female applicants.”              But in the same\n\ndeposition he stated that the City specifically targets blacks by\n\n“targeting the African-American churches.”              When asked whether the\n\nCity’s recruiting policy is adequately geared towards attracting\n\nminorities, Chief Cochran admitted, “the City has never done any\n\nkind of self-evaluation to see if its recruiting efforts are\n\nappropriate for recruiting minorities and women.”                      Thus, the\n\nefficacy   of   alternative      measures    remains     a   genuine      issue   of\n\nmaterial fact that must be resolved on remand.\n\n                    b. Flexibility and Duration\n\n      The district court found the decree and the hiring process\n\nadequately flexible.          The court also decided that their long\n\nduration did not preclude finding the remedies narrowly tailored.\n\n      The primary question when analyzing a remedy’s flexibility is\n\nwhether its requirements may be waived.            See Paradise, 480 U.S. at\n\n177   (focusing      its     flexibility     analysis     solely     on    whether\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\frequirements   could   be    waived).         If   they   may,    the   remedy   is\n\nadequately flexible.        See id.     The decree requires the City to\n\nadopt the long-term goal of achieving, subject to the availability\n\nof qualified applicants, the same proportions of blacks and women\n\nin its fire department “as blacks and women bear to the appropriate\n\nwork force in the particular jurisdiction.”               It also requires the\n\nCity to adopt an interim goal of hiring at least fifty percent\n\nblack and fifteen percent female employees until the long-term goal\n\nis achieved and maintained for one year.               The goal of the hiring\n\nprocess parallels the interim goal in the decree. While the decree\n\ndoes not allow the goals to be waived, it does specify that they\n\nare “subject to the availability of qualified applicants.”\n\n     Despite this explicit exception, Appellants argue that the\n\ndecree and hiring policy require a rigid fifty percent racial\n\nquota. The City, relying on the waiver provision, insists both are\n\nflexible.   The City also points out that since 1980, it has hired\n\nless than fifty percent black employees in all but two hiring\n\nclasses.    We agree with the district court that the remedies are\n\nadequately flexible.    We do so because the remedies here, as far as\n\ntheir flexibility is concerned, parallel the flexibility of the\n\nremedy in Paradise. In that case, the Alabama Department of Public\n\nSafety was required to award half of all state trooper promotions\n\nto black employees.      Paradise, 480 U.S. at 153.                However, the\n\nrequirement    was   contingent   on        the    availability    of   qualified\n\n\n\n                                       20\n\fcandidates.          Id. at 177.           This alone satisfied the flexibility\n\nrequirement.          Id. at 177-78.             Like the remedy in Paradise, the\n\nremedies here are contingent on the availability of qualified\n\napplicants and are therefore adequately flexible.\n\n       The central theme of a duration analysis is that the shorter\n\nthe life-span of the remedy, the more likely it is narrowly\n\ntailored.        See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 178.                     The City’s obligations\n\nunder the decree end when it achieves its long-term goal, that is,\n\nwhen the City achieves the same proportions of blacks and women in\n\nits fire department “as blacks and women bear to the appropriate\n\nwork force.”         In order to estimate when a particular goal might be\n\nachieved, the goal must be clear.                     Thus, here it must be clear what\n\nproportions “blacks and women bear to the appropriate work force.”\n\nDetermining this requires a precise definition of the phrase\n\n“appropriate         work     force.”          We     have     no    precise       definition.8\n\n\n\n       8\n          Contrary to Appellants’ contention, we did not define the “appropriate work force” in United\nStates v. City of Alexandria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374664\"><a href=\"/opinion/374664/22-fair-emplpraccas-872-22-empl-prac-dec-p-30829-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1980). However, we did state that the decree\n“established long term goals of achieving . . . the same percentages of blacks and women as are\npresent in the workforces in the various affected localities.” Id. at 1362. Appellants argue this\nstatement conclusively established the goal of the decree as achieving a percentage of blacks in the\nfire department equal to that in the general population. Appellants also insist we are now bound by\nthat statement. This would make the goal of the decree unconstitutional under Croson, 488 U.S. at\n501-02.\n          We disagree with Appellants for several reasons. First, by elevating the standard of review\nto strict scrutiny, Croson, 488 U.S. at 494, effectively overruled our holding in City of Alexandria.\nSecond, the definition of the phrase “appropriate work force” was not at issue in that case. See\ngenerally City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d at 1361-67. Third, our statement referring to “the\nworkforces,” id. at 1362, may have been shorthand for “the appropriate work forces,” to which the\nplain language of the decree refers. In any event, we are not bound today by our alleged\ninterpretation of the decree, or our subsequent approval of it, in City of Alexandria.\n\n                                                 21\n\fTherefore, the City’s goal remains unclear, and we cannot properly\n\nanalyze duration.\n\n     When interpreting a consent decree, general principles of\n\ncontract interpretation govern.

We begin by looking to\n\nthe “four corners” of the decree.            Id. at 350.     We will then look\n\nto extrinsic evidence if the decree is ambiguous.                N. Shore Lab.\n\nCorp. v.

A decree “is\n\nambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one\n\nmeaning, in light of surrounding circumstances and established\n\nrules of construction.”        Id.\n\n     We find the phrase “appropriate work force” ambiguous as a\n\nmatter of law.      The decree itself sheds no light on what the\n\nadjective “appropriate” means in this context.               Because we cannot\n\ndecipher its meaning within the four corners of the decree, we need\n\nextrinsic evidence to aid our interpretation.               We have none.      For\n\nexample, we have no preliminary drafts of the consent decree or\n\ncorrespondence     between     the   parties    during      negotiations.   This\n\nevidence   would   help   us    determine      what   the    parties   meant   by\n\n“appropriate work force.”        Without extrinsic evidence, we have no\n\nreason to choose one possible definition over another. Because the\n\nphrase “appropriate work force” was not defined by the district\n\ncourt, and because we are unable to do so without extrinsic\n\nevidence, the issue must be resolved on remand.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f       We also stress that regardless of the outcome of the issue on\n\nremand, the duration component of this Paradise factor will favor\n\nAppellants, at least to some degree. The durations of the remedies\n\nin this case are breathtakingly long in comparison to others we\n\nhave reviewed.9              Edwards v. City of Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714815\"><a href=\"/opinion/714815/dorothy-a-edwards-afro-american-police-officers-league-houston-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002\n\n(5th Cir. 1996) (en banc), involved a consent decree that allowed\n\na   police      department         to    promote       a   certain       number      of   minority\n\nofficers to sergeant and lieutenant.10                         The remedy was to last no\n\nlonger than five years.                 Id.   In Black Fire Fighters Ass’n, 19 F.3d\n\nat 997, we struck down a consent decree that allowed a fire\n\ndepartment to promote a certain number of minorities to higher\n\nranking positions. We found the remedy not to be narrowly tailored\n\neven though it lasted for only three years.                                 Id.      Finally, in\n\nPolice Ass’n, 100 F.3d at 1173, we again struck down a race-\n\nconscious promotional plan. We found the remedy not to be narrowly\n\ntailored even though it was a one-time set of promotions, not an\n\nongoing plan.          Id. at 1169.\n\n       Therefore, the durations of the remedies in this case are\n\nalready considerably longer than those in any of our previous\n\ncases.         Thus,      this     factor       will       weigh    in     Appellants’         favor\n\n\n       9\n        In the midst of this litigation in 2004, the City changed its hiring process. Nevertheless, we\ncannot ignore the fact that when Appellants’ claims arose, the process had been used for over twenty\nyears. The decree had been in effect for just as long, and continues to this day.\n       10\n          Although we did not reach the merits regarding the consent decree’s constitutionality in\nEdwards, we refer to the case to illustrate just how long the durations of the remedies in this case are\nin relation to others we have been confronted with in the past.\n\n                                                  23\n\fregardless of how soon the district court determines the remedies\n\nmight end.    We point this out only to emphasize that in order for\n\nthese remedies to be upheld on remand, other Paradise factors must\n\nstrongly suggest they are narrowly tailored.\n\n      On remand, the district court must determine, using extrinsic\n\nevidence, the decree’s precise long-term goal by defining the\n\n“appropriate work force.”         It must then estimate how long it will\n\ntake for the City to achieve that goal.                   When an approximate end\n\ndate is known, the district court can then re-weigh the duration\n\nfactor,    keeping   in    mind    the        past   precedent     we     have    just\n\nhighlighted.\n\n                  c.

Nor could it have.        The long-term numerical goal of a\n\nrace-conscious remedy must be closely tied to the relevant labor\n\nmarket.    See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 179.                  To weigh this factor,\n\ncommon sense demands we first know the remedy’s numerical goal and\n\nthe relevant labor market.        As discussed above, we know neither.\n\n      Croson mandates the number of minorities in the relevant labor\n\nmarket be determined by the “number of minorities qualified to\n\nundertake the particular task.”               Croson, 488 U.S. at 502.           As we\n\npointed out first in our compelling interest analysis, and again in\n\nthe   necessity   and     efficacy   portion         of    our   narrow    tailoring\n\nanalysis, the City has not provided us with the demographics of its\n\n\n                                         24\n\fqualified applicant pool. Therefore, we cannot properly define the\n\n“relevant labor market.” This alone prevents us from reviewing and\n\nweighing this factor.            Further, as discussed in our duration\n\nanalysis, the long-term goal of the decree is unclear.                   Until we\n\nknow the numerical goal of the decree and the relevant labor\n\nmarket,    the   relationship      between    the    numerical   goal    and   the\n\nrelevant labor market remains a genuine issue of material fact to\n\nbe resolved on remand.\n\n                   d. Impact of the Relief on Third Parties\n\n      The final Paradise factor ensures a remedy does “not impose\n\nan unacceptable burden on innocent third parties.”                Paradise, 480\n\nU.S. at 182.     The district court found the impact on third parties\n\n“not overly significant” in this case.              See Dean, slip op. at 18.\n\nThe Supreme Court has given little guidance on this factor, but has\n\nmade a few things clear.          First, remedies requiring nonminorities\n\nto be fired impose a severe, and possibly unacceptable, burden on\n\nthird parties.     Paradise, 480 U.S. at 182.          Hiring preferences are\n\nless burdensome.        See id.    Second, remedies allowing unqualified\n\nminorities to be hired are likely not narrowly tailored.                  See id.\n\nat 183.     Third, remedies merely postponing a benefit to third\n\nparties    are   less   burdensome    than    ones     permanently     denying   a\n\nbenefit.    See id.\n\n     We    agree    with   the     district    court     that    the    impact on\n\nnonminorities is not significant enough to make the decree and\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\fhiring policy unconstitutional per se.                 We do so because the\n\nremedies in this case have all three characteristics the Supreme\n\nCourt has previously said favor a finding of narrow tailoring\n\nwithin   the   context    of   this   factor:    (1)   they   do   not   require\n\nnonminorities to be fired; (2) they do not require unqualified\n\nminorities to be hired; and (3) they do not pose an absolute bar to\n\nnonminority employment. Paradise, 480 U.S. at 182-83. This factor\n\nalone does not prevent a finding of narrow tailoring.\n\n      In sum, the district court on remand must develop the record\n\nfurther and re-evaluate both whether the decree and the hiring\n\nprocess were still justified at the time of suit by a compelling\n\ngovernment interest and whether they were narrowly tailored to\n\nfurther that interest.\n\nIII. Appellants’ Title VII Claim\n\n      Appellants also argue that the City’s hiring process violates\n\nTitle VII. Specifically, Appellants refer us to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(l), which was added to Title VII in 1991 and provides that “[i]t\n\nshall be an unlawful employment practice . . . in connection with\n\nthe   selection   or     referral     of    applicants   or   candidates    for\n\nemployment . . . to adjust the scores of, use different cutoff\n\nscores for, or otherwise alter the results of, employment related\n\ntests on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.” § 2000e-2(l) (emphasis added)            Appellants claim that by\n\nseparating applicants’ Civil Service Exam scores by race, the City\n\n\n                                       26\n\fin effect uses different cutoff scores on the basis of race.    We\n\nagree that the City’s hiring process violates the plain language of\n\nsection 2000e-2(l).\n\n      First, we must point out that our decision that the City’s\n\nhiring process violates section 2000e-2(l) will stand even if on\n\nremand the district court finds that the hiring process passes\n\nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.   That is, even if the\n\nprocess is “upheld as a valid method of affirmative action,”\n\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773163\"><a href=\"/opinion/773163/chicago-firefighters-local-2-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656\n\n(7th Cir. 2001), it nevertheless violates the specific prohibitions\n\nof section 2000e-2(l).   See id. (recognizing that the practice of\n\n“banding” test scores is an acceptable form of affirmative action\n\nunder other Title VII provisions and the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nbut continuing on to determine whether that practice violated\n\nsection 2000e-2(l)).\n\n      Appellants insist that the City violates section 2000e-2(l)\n\nwhen, pursuant to its hiring policy, it ranks test takers from\n\nhighest to lowest exam score, but then separates those scores\n\naccording to race and sex.    The City responds, and the district\n\ncourt held, that the hiring process does not violate the statute\n\nbecause “[e]very applicant, black or white, ha[s] to score at least\n\na seventy-five to pass the Civil Service Exam.”   Dean, slip op. at\n\n20.   This conclusion is incomplete, however, because it focuses\n\nonly on the initial portion of phase one of the City’s hiring\n\n\n                                27\n\fprocess instead of on the entire process.        The City is correct that\n\nall applicants are subject to the same initial requirement at phase\n\none -- a score of at least seventy-five on the Civil Service Exam.\n\nOur analysis, however, cannot stop there because the City uses the\n\ntest scores again at another important step in the hiring process.\n\nA passing score of seventy-five only makes applicants eligible for\n\nfurther consideration.      Later in the process the City again uses\n\nthe exam scores to choose which applicants will proceed to phase\n\ntwo of the hiring process.         The City separates applicants’ exam\n\nscores by race and sex and selects the same number of blacks and\n\nwhites to proceed, starting with the highest exam score on each\n\nsegregated list.\n\n      This method of selection between phase one and phase two\n\nviolates the plain language of section 2000e-2(l) because it has\n\nthe practical effect of requiring different cutoff scores, based\n\nsolely on race and sex, for continuing further in the hiring\n\nprocess.   We see no reason to ignore a clear violation of section\n\n2000e-2(l) between phase one and phase two simply because at the\n\noutset of phase one the same cutoff score is required of all\n\napplicants.    Compliance with section 2000e-2(l) is required at all\n\ntimes during employment activities carried out “in connection with\n\nthe   selection    or   referral   of     applicants   or   candidates   for\n\nemployment.”      See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(l).\n\n      We find that the City’s hiring process violates Title VII.\n\n\n                                     28\n\fTherefore, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of Appellants’\n\nTitle VII claim.\n\nIV. Appellants’ Louisiana Constitutional Claim\n\n     Appellants’ next contention is that the City’s hiring process\n\nviolates the Louisiana Constitution.               Appellants point to Article\n\nI, Section 3, which states not only that “[n]o person shall be\n\ndenied the equal protection of the Laws,” but also that “[n]o law\n\nshall discriminate against a person because of race.” The district\n\ncourt, after determining that the City’s hiring process survived\n\nscrutiny under the United States Constitution, held that regardless\n\nof whether the hiring process violates the Louisiana Constitution,\n\n“Louisiana law must bow to federal law, which is the supreme law of\n\nthe land.”    Dean, slip op. at 21.                On appeal, the City simply\n\nstates that even if its hiring process violates the Louisiana\n\nConstitution, the consent decree shields the City from liability\n\nbecause it “preempts state law.”              We disagree and find that the\n\ndistrict court erred in determining that preemption affords the\n\nCity any form of protection from possible violations of state law.\n\n     Clearly,      had   the    City   been    required   by       federal    law   to\n\nimplement    its    hiring      process       to    redress    a     past    federal\n\nconstitutional violation, federal law would preempt the Louisiana\n\nConstitution.        See   In    re    Birmingham      Reverse      Discrimination\n\nEmployment Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1501 (11th Cir. 1987).                     But that\n\nis not the situation we face here.            The City originally denied that\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fit had engaged in intentional discrimination and was not found to\n\nbe   in     violation   of    the     United    States   Constitution.      More\n\nimportantly, the City was never ordered by a federal court, nor\n\nmandated by any other federal law, to enter into the consent\n\ndecree.     Rather, the City did so voluntarily.             Thus, in the eyes of\n\nthe law the City’s hiring process is nothing more than a voluntary\n\naffirmative action program.\n\n      As the Eleventh Circuit has stated:\n\n      We perceive no reason for treating a consent decree\n      entered pursuant to a voluntary settlement differently\n      from a voluntary affirmative action plan.        In both\n      instances, the employer has embarked on a voluntary\n      undertaking;    we   reject    any   notion    that   the\n      memorialization of that voluntary undertaking in the form\n      of a consent decree somehow provides the employer with\n      extra    protection    against    charges   of    illegal\n      discrimination . . . .     It should be emphasized that\n      there has been no judicial determination that the City is\n      liable for past discrimination . . . . Thus . . . we are\n      not presented with a case in which the defendant was\n      required by law to implement an affirmative action\n      program designed to remedy the effects of past\n      discrimination.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 833 F.2d\n\nat   1501    (11th   Cir.    1987).      We    think   the   Eleventh   Circuit’s\n\nreasoning is sound. As far as preemption is concerned, a voluntary\n\nconsent decree has the same effect on state law as does a voluntary\n\naffirmative action program--none.\n\n      Therefore, we need only decide whether the City’s practice of\n\nseparating applicants by race during its hiring process violates\n\nthe Louisiana Constitution.           We think it is beyond dispute that it\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\fdoes.   Decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana bind us with\n\nregard to the meaning of Louisiana constitutional provisions.\n\nThose decisions make abundantly clear that Article I, Section 3 of\n\nthe Louisiana Constitution provides far greater protection against\n\nracial discrimination than does its federal counterpart.                       See,\n\ne.g., La. Associated Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142423\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142423/la-associated-gen-contractors-inc-v-state-ex-rel-div-of-admini/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (La. 1996).        Under the United States Constitution,\n\nclassifications based on race are permissible if they are narrowly\n\ntailored to serve a compelling government interest.                  See Paradise,\n\n480 U.S. at 166-67.       However, under the Louisiana Constitution,\n\nclassifications based on race “shall be repudiated completely,\n\nregardless of the justification.” La. Associated Gen. Contractors,\n\nInc., 669 So. 2d at 1198.            Under Louisiana law, once it is\n\ndetermined that a classification based on race has been drawn, the\n\ninquiry is over--Article I, Section 3 of the Louisiana Constitution\n\nhas been violated.        See id.        Here, the City’s hiring process\n\nunquestionably classifies according to race.                  The City separates\n\nwhite   and   black   firefighter        applicants         when   deciding   which\n\napplicants will proceed to phase two of the hiring process.                    The\n\nCity’s actions violate Article I, Section 3 of the Louisiana\n\nConstitution.     Also,    even     if        on   remand    the   district   court\n\ndetermines that the consent decree survives strict scrutiny under\n\nthe United States Constitution, an outcome which is far from\n\ncertain, the Louisiana Constitution is not preempted because the\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fdecree was entered into voluntarily.       Therefore, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of Appellants’ Louisiana constitutional\n\nclaim.\n\nV. Appellants’ Louisiana Statutory Claim\n\n     Appellants’ final argument is that the City’s hiring process\n\nviolates    a   Louisiana   anti-discrimination   employment   statute.\n\nAppellants note that LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 23:332(A)(2) (1998)   makes\n\nit unlawful for employers in Louisiana to “[i]ntentionally limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify . . . employees or applicants . . . in any\n\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status\n\nas an employee, because of the individual’s race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.”\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nCity dismissing this claim.      We agree with the court’s ruling on\n\nthis claim because Appellants’ argument is foreclosed by the plain\n\nlanguage of another subsection of the statute they rely upon, which\n\nprovides that “[n]othing contained in [section 23:332] shall be\n\nconstrued so as to create a cause of action against an employer .\n\n. . for employment practices pursuant to any affirmative action\n\nplan.”     LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 23:332(G) (emphasis added).       The\n\nstatute make no distinction between valid and invalid affirmative\n\naction plans.     See id.   Therefore, regardless of the outcome on\n\nremand of Appellants’ remaining claim, the City’s practice of\n\n\n                                   32\n\fclassifying applicants according to race and sex does not violate\n\nthis   statute.   We   affirm    the     district   court’s   dismissal   of\n\nAppellants’ Louisiana statutory claim.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ndismissal of Appellants’ Louisiana statutory claim; we REVERSE its\n\ndismissal of Appellants’ equal protection claim and REMAND the case\n\nfor further factual development of the equal protection claim; and\n\nwe REVERSE its dismissal of Appellants’ Title VII and Louisiana\n\nconstitutional claims, and with respect to the Title VII and\n\nLouisiana constitutional claims, we REMAND the case for further\n\nproceedings concerning the entitlement of each individual Appellant\n\nto relief.\n\nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; and REMANDED for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f</pre>",
