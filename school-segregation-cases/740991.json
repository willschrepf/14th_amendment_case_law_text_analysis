Both Petitioners, Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed from the United States, are currently in the indefinite and potentially permanent custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") because Cuba refuses to allow them to return. In its recent decision in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\") that authorizes the post-removal-period detention of removed aliens must be construed to contain an \"implicit `reasonable time' limitation\" because the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability \"would raise serious constitutional concerns.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first conclude that Rosales's and Carballo's detention by the INS is governed by IIRIRA. We then conclude that although Rosales and Carballo are removable on grounds of inadmissibility, as opposed to deportability, the Supreme Court's limiting construction of IIRIRA's post-removal-detention provision applies to their detention. Finally, we conclude that even if the Supreme Court's construction of IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and Carballo, their indefinite detention independently raises constitutional concerns, and we construe IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision as it applies to Rosales and Carballo to contain an implicit reasonable-time limitation. Because there is no significant likelihood of the petitioners' removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the continued detention of the petitioners by the INS is not authorized by the applicable statute, and we REVERSE the district courts' denials of their habeas petitions and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners-Appellants Mario Rosales-Garcia (\"Rosales\") and Reynero Arteaga Carballo (\"Carballo\") arrived in this country as part of the Mariel boatlift in 1980, during which over 120,000 Cubans crossed by boat from the Mariel harbor in Cuba to the United States. Rosales and Carballo, like most of the Mariel Cubans, arrived in this country without documentation permitting them legal entry; therefore, because they were not authorized to enter the country and because immigration officials stopped them at the border, they were deemed \"excludable\" under the immigration law in effect at the time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> Although excludable aliens have not \"entered\" the country for the purposes of immigration law, Rosales and Carballo were permitted physical entry into the United States pursuant to the Attorney General's authority under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) to grant immigration parole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As of 1986, this parole has been governed by regulations specifically promulgated by the INS for Mariel Cubans. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.12 (2002) (the \"Cuban Review Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their independent criminal convictions, the Attorney General, acting through the INS, revoked Rosales's and Carballo's parole and initiated exclusion proceedings against them. Both petitioners were excluded and, pursuant to the immigration law in effect at the time, they should have been immediately deported. Cuba, however, has refused to repatriate most of the Mariel Cubans whom the United States has excluded, and the U.S. government does not contend in this appeal that a repatriation by Cuba of either Rosales or Carballo is reasonably foreseeable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because Cuba refused to accept the deportation of either Rosales or Carballo, the INS has detained them in prisons in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rosales</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales was twenty-three when he arrived in the United States, and he was soon thereafter paroled into the custody of his aunt. Beginning in 1980, Rosales was arrested for a number of offenses, including aggravated battery, possession of marijuana, burglary, and loitering. Rosales was convicted of the following offenses: possession of marijuana and resisting arrest in October 1981; grand theft in September 1981, for which he received two years of probation in March 1983; burglary and grand larceny in October 1983, for which he received two six-month sentences, to be served consecutively; escape from a penal institution in February 1984, for which he received a 366-day sentence; and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine in March 1993, for which he received a sixty-three month federal prison sentence and five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1986, Rosales's immigration parole was revoked by the INS on the basis of the escape and grand larceny convictions, pursuant to INS authority under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) and 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(d)(2) (1986). In a separate proceeding before an immigration judge, Rosales was denied asylum and ordered excluded on June 26, 1987, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(20) (1982), for improper documentation. Rosales was in INS detention between July 1986 and May 1988, when he was again released on parole. After he pleaded guilty to the cocaine conspiracy charge in 1993, the INS revoked Rosales's parole, this time pursuant to the Cuban Review Plan. When Rosales was released from federal prison in May 1997, the INS detained him, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(e) (1994). Rosales remained in INS detention for four years, during which time he was denied parole twice, in November 1997 and March 1999, under the Cuban Review Plan. In April 2001, Rosales was granted parole and released into a halfway house program. Rosales completed the program in May 2001, and he was subsequently released into the community under conditions of supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales filed his pro se habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on July 9, 1998. In the petition, he alleged that his \"continued incarceration is illegal, it violates Due Process, statu[t]es, and case law....\" Rosales Joint Appendix (\"Rosales J.A.\") at 9. The district court initially denied Rosales's habeas petition sua sponte in October of 1998; however, Rosales filed a motion to amend, and the district court vacated its initial denial. On May 3, 1999, the district court denied with prejudice Rosales's amended habeas petition. The court concluded that under the IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (Supp.V.1999), the Attorney General was authorized to detain Rosales indefinitely, and the court further concluded that such detention did not violate Rosales's constitutional substantive or procedural due process rights. In regard to Rosales's substantive due process claim, the court held that Rosales \"ha[d] no fundamental right to be free to roam the United States.\" Rosales J.A. at 91. With respect to Rosales's procedural due process claim, the court held that \"[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\" Rosales J.A. at 91 (quoting <i>United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy,</i> 338 U.S. 537, 544, 70 S.Ct. 309, 94 L.Ed. 317 (1950)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 4, 2000, a panel of this court heard the case on appeal, and on January 31, 2001, the panel reversed the district court's denial of Rosales's petition. Following the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), the government petitioned the Court for certiorari, asking that the panel's decision be vacated and remanded in light of <i>Zadvydas.</i> On December 10, 2001, the Supreme Court granted the government's request. <i>Thoms v. Rosales-Garcia,</i> 534 U.S. 1063, 122 S.Ct. 662, 151 L.Ed.2d 577 (2001). Following our sua sponte decision to hear <i>Carballo v. Luttrell</i> en banc, Rosales requested that his case be heard en banc together with <i>Carballo,</i> we granted his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Carballo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carballo was twenty-five when he arrived in the United States, and he too was soon thereafter released on parole. By 1983, Carballo had been arrested sixteen times, for offenses including aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny, battery, carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm, trespassing, and possession of marijuana.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In April 1983, Carballo was convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery, for which he received a sentence of eight years for the murder, eight years for the robbery, and five years for the aggravated assault. During his incarceration, the INS initiated exclusion proceedings, and in September 1994, an immigration judge ordered Carballo excluded, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (crimes of moral turpitude), (a)(2)(B) (multiple criminal convictions), and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (improper documentation) (1994). Upon the completion of his sentence, in June of 1988, Carballo was taken into custody by the INS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He has been detained since then, although his status has been reviewed annually, pursuant to the Cuban Review Plan. While this case was pending, on December 17, 2002, Carballo was placed by the INS in a ninemonth residential substance-abuse program at the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1990, Carballo filed a pro se habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Carballo claimed that the Attorney General did not have the authority to detain him beyond a reasonable time to effect his exclusion and that his continued detention violated his constitutional substantive and procedural due process rights. A magistrate judge recommended that Carballo's petition be denied, and on November 26, 1991, the district court denied Carballo's petition. The district court concluded that the Attorney General had implied statutory authority to detain Carballo under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a) (1988). Addressing Carballo's constitutional claims, the court held that because Carballo's detention did not constitute punishment, it did not violate substantive due process. The court further held that Carballo was entitled to only as much procedural due process as Congress granted him. Carballo did not appeal this denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 1998, Carballo filed a successive habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The district court denied Carballo's successive petition on May 10, 1999. After finding that Carballo raised the same claims in his successive habeas petition as he had raised in his original habeas petition, the court stated that the \"law of the case doctrine prevents this court from reconsidering petitioner's entirely repetitive claim.\" Carballo Joint Appendix (\"Carballo J.A.\") at 20. Carballo appealed this denial, and a panel of this court heard the case on March 9, 2001. On October 11, 2001, the panel affirmed the decision of the district court. On November 3, 2001, we sua sponte granted Carballo a rehearing en banc, vacating the decision of the panel. Carballo requested that his case be heard together with Rosales's, and we granted his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Availability of the Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Rosales and Carballo filed petitions for habeas corpus relief in the district court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241. Recently in <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> the Supreme Court definitively concluded that aliens detained by the INS can petition for writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 &#8212; whether they are detained pursuant to the pre-1996 statutory regime, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), or IIRIRA. <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 298-314, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). The Court held that \"[a]t its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 301, 121 S.Ct. 2271. \"[U]nder the pre-1996 statutory scheme &#8212; and consistent with its common-law antecedents &#8212; it is clear that St. Cyr could have brought his challenge to the Board of Immigration Appeals' legal determination in a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241.\" <i>Id.</i> at 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Although the government argued that certain provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA barred habeas petitions under those statutes, the Court determined that habeas jurisdiction under &#167; 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA or IIRIRA. <i>Id.</i> at 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271; <i>see also Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 688, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (\"&#167; 2241 habeas corpus proceedings remain available as a forum for statutory and constitutional challenges to post-removal-period detention.\"). Therefore, the district courts properly had jurisdiction over Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions, and we have jurisdiction to review the district courts' denials of those petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Mootness &#8212; Rosales</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales was released from INS detention and paroled into the United States in May of 2001; the government contends that Rosales's appeal is therefore moot. \"Under Article III of the Constitution, our jurisdiction extends only to actual cases and controversies. We have no power to adjudicate disputes which are moot.\" <i>McPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc.,</i> 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). Even if a case was not moot in the district court, if it becomes moot on appeal, we must dismiss the case unless \"the relief sought would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> Because Rosales is still \"in custody\" for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 and because the relief he seeks, if granted, would make a difference to his legal interests, we conclude that his appeal is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that \"if a prisoner is released from custody during the pendency of his case, his habeas petition becomes moot.\" Gov't Supp. Br. re Rosales at 19. In <i>Jones v. Cunningham,</i> 371 U.S. 236, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963), however, the Supreme Court held that a paroled prisoner was in the custody of his state parole board for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241. \"While petitioner's parole releases him from immediate physical imprisonment, it imposes conditions which significantly confine and restrain his freedom; this is enough to keep him in the `custody' of the members of the Virginia Parole Board within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute....\" <i>Jones,</i> 371 U.S. at 243, 83 S.Ct. 373; <i>see also DePompei v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth.,</i> 999 F.2d 138, 140 (6th Cir.1993). Although Rosales's parole was not based on a criminal conviction, it imposes similarly restrictive conditions. <i>See</i> Rosales Supp. J.A. at 4-5 (Conditions of Parole). Therefore, we conclude that even though he has been paroled into the United States, Rosales is still in the custody of the INS for the purposes of his habeas petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry into whether Rosales's claim is moot cannot end, however, with a determination of custody. In <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> the Supreme Court determined that a petitioner's release did not by itself moot his habeas petition, but the Court then explained that \"[t]he more substantial question ... is whether petitioner's subsequent release caused the petition to be moot because it no longer presented a case or controversy under Article III, &#167; 2, of the Constitution.\" <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). Rosales petitioned the district court for habeas relief, alleging that his continued <i>detention</i> by the INS was impermissible on both statutory and constitutional grounds. We thus must ask whether Rosales's claim is moot because he is no longer being <i>detained</i> by the INS. \"The parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit. This means that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rosales is not currently being detained, his immigration parole can be revoked by the INS at any time for almost any reason.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> Unlike parole granted following incarceration for a criminal conviction, Rosales need not do anything for the INS to revoke his parole; for instance, the INS can revoke Rosales's parole if it deems such revocation to be \"in the public interest.\" <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.12(h) (2002). Thus, Rosales's \"release\" into the United States does not constitute a termination of detention; it simply constitutes a reprieve from detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> Under these circumstances, we believe that Rosales is threatened with an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. We therefore conclude that Rosales's appeal is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other strands of the Supreme Court's mootness jurisprudence support this conclusion. First, the Supreme Court has held that \"[i]t is well settled that `a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.' ... `[I]f it did, the courts would be compelled to leave [t]he defendant... free to return to his old ways.'\" <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (quoting <i>City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 283, 289 &amp; n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982)). Second, the Court has long recognized an exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" This exception applies where \"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\" <i>Spencer,</i> 523 U.S. at 17, 118 S.Ct. 978 (quotation omitted); <i>see also Suster v. Marshall,</i> 149 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 1114, 119 S.Ct. 890, 142 L.Ed.2d 788 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether a case has been mooted by the defendant's voluntary conduct, the Supreme Court has articulated the following standard: \"A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" <i>Friends of the Earth,</i> 528 U.S. at 189, 120 S.Ct. 693. As discussed above, the INS can revoke Rosales's parole at any time. We have noted that \"cessation of the allegedly illegal conduct by government officials has been treated with more solicitude by the courts than similar action by private parties.\" <i>Mosley v. Hairston,</i> 920 F.2d 409, 415 (6th Cir.1990) (quoting 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3533.7 (2d ed.1984)). The Ninth Circuit has even held that a Mariel Cuban's parole did moot his habeas petition because, on the basis of government declarations, the court concluded that \"the alleged wrong will not recur.\" <i>Picrin-Peron v. Rison,</i> 930 F.2d 773, 776 (9th Cir.1991). In <i>Picrin-Peron,</i> the government stated in its dismissal motion that \"[a]bsent Picrin's reinvolvement with the criminal justice system, a change in the Cuban government enabling him to return to Cuba, or the willingness of a third country to accept him, he will be paroled for another year,\" and an INS official reiterated the statement in a declaration made under oath. <i>Id.</i> The government in Rosales's case, however, has made no such promise, nor has the government made it \"absolutely clear\" in any other way that potentially indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS cannot reasonably be expected to recur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that the indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS is a case \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Because the INS can revoke Rosales's parole at any time and has in fact revoked Rosales's parole twice in the past fifteen years, there is a reasonable expectation that Rosales will again be subject to indefinite INS detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, because the INS can grant Rosales parole at any time, such detention can always evade review. The government argues that \"there is no basis for concluding that when a Mariel Cuban's parole is revoked, the alien will always be rereleased in a time that is so short that the legality of his detention will evade review.\" Gov't Supp. Br. re Rosales at 22-23. It is true that the Cuban Review Plan requires the INS to follow certain procedures before releasing a Mariel Cuban into the United States. However, the INS granted Rosales parole in the two years between the denial of his habeas petition by the district court and our review, and we have every reason to believe both that the INS could again accomplish a release in the same amount of time and that another habeas petition filed by Rosales would take at least as long as the instant case in arriving in this court. <i>See Honig v.

By their own terms, however, these provisions do not apply to petitioners like Carballo who are not in custody pursuant to a conviction in state or federal court. <i>See Barapind v.

The Supreme Court held in <i>Sanders v.

In regard to the third prong, the <i>Sanders</i> Court stated that \"[e]ven if the same ground was rejected on the merits on a prior application, it is open to the applicant to show that the ends of justice would be served by permitting the redetermination of the ground.\" <i>Sanders,</i> 373 U.S. at 16, 83 S.Ct. 1068. \"If purely legal questions are involved, the applicant may be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17, 83 S.Ct. 1068; <i>see also Lonberger,</i> 808 F.2d at 1174. Applying <i>Sanders,</i> Carballo argues that IIRIRA and the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Zadvydas</i> constitute an intervening change in the law and thus that the ends of justice would be served by considering the claims in his successive habeas petition. <i>See</i> Carballo's Supp. Br. at 13-14. The government, however, also applying <i>Sanders,</i> contends that <i>Zadvydas</i> does not constitute a change in the law and that IIRIRA does not apply to Carballo. <i>See</i> Gov't Supp. Br. re Carballo at 57-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our analysis below, we conclude that IIRIRA is the appropriate statute to apply to Rosales and Carballo. We also agree with Carballo that IIRIRA, and the Supreme Court's interpretation of its post-removal-period detention provision in <i>Zadvydas,</i> constitute an intervening change in the law sufficient to warrant our review of his petition. Although the post-removal-period detention provision of IIRIRA is in itself not substantially different from the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law, the Supreme Court's construction of IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision in <i>Zadvydas</i> is different from the construction of the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law that prevailed in most circuits at the time Carballo filed his original habeas petition. Therefore, Carballo is able in this habeas petition to raise legal arguments that he was unable to raise in his habeas petition in the Northern District of Texas. <i>See Collins v. Zant,</i> 892 F.2d 1502, 1505 (11th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 498 U.S. 881, 111 S.Ct. 225, 112 L.Ed.2d 180 (1990) (\"In analyzing `the ends of justice,' a court may consider new <i>arguments</i> (based, for example, on intervening changes in the law) that a petitioner raises in support of an old claim.\") (emphasis in original). Because, moreover, such arguments go to the constitutionality of and statutory authorization for Carballo's indefinite detention, it serves the ends of justice for us to reach the merits of Carballo's successive habeas petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> did apply IIRIRA to such a petitioner, Zadvydas, but it did not explain its reason for so doing. <i>See Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Moreover, the government and the petitioner in <i>Zadvydas</i> agreed on what statute to apply. <i>See Zadvydas v. Underdown,</i> 185 F.3d 279, 286-87 (5th Cir. 1999), <i>vacated and remanded sub nom. Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). According to the government, &#167; 309(c)(1) of IIRIRA precludes us from applying IIRIRA to an alien excluded prior to the statute's effective date. Section 309(c)(1), entitled \"General rule that new rules do not apply,\" provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings before the title III-A effective date [April 1, 1997] &#8212; (A) the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply, and (B) the proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 (2000), note regarding \"Effective Dates\" (reprinting IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1)). Inasmuch as the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> did not discuss the application of IIRIRA to Zadvydas, we cannot simply assume that such application is appropriate for all aliens deported or excluded before April 1, 1997. We are persuaded for other reasons, however, that IIRIRA is the appropriate statute to assess in our review of the merits of Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and Carballo because, pursuant to &#167; 309(c), IIRIRA does not apply to aliens who were in exclusion or deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. It is not clear from the government's brief whether it believes this interpretation to be of the statute's retroactivity (i.e., that IIRIRA does not apply retroactively to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date) or of the statute's general applicability (i.e., that IIRIRA generally does not apply to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date). To the extent that the argument is one of IIRIRA's retroactivity, we do not believe that retroactivity is at issue in these appeals. In <i>Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock,</i> the Ninth Circuit considered the legality of an excludable alien's detention under the statute in effect at the time of the decision. <i>Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock,</i> 941 F.2d 956, 960 (9th Cir.1991), <i>cert. denied,</i> 506 U.S. 842, 113 S.Ct. 127, 121 L.Ed.2d 82 (1992). \"Although the new section 1226(e) does not retroactively authorize any of the Attorney General's acts accomplished prior to the amendment, we are concerned here only with the legality of Alvarez-Mendez's <i>present detention.</i> Because this case involves a petition for the writ of habeas corpus, and not a claim for damages for illegal detention, <i>the only issue before us is whether Alvarez-Mendez's detention is illegal today.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). We agree with this reasoning. Rosales and Carballo are not challenging the legality of their original detention &#8212; they are challenging the INS's authority to detain them now. Therefore, whether IIRIRA <i>retroactively</i> authorizes Rosales's and Carballo's detention is irrelevant; we need only assess whether IIRIRA <i>currently</i> authorizes their detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the government's argument is one of IIRIRA's general applicability, the Supreme Court has stated that \"[s]ection 309(c)(1) is best read as merely setting out the <i>procedural</i> rules to be applied to removal proceedings pending on the effective date of the statute.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 318, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (emphasis in original). The <i>St. Cyr</i> Court also noted that \"the Conference Report expressly explained, `[Section 309(c)] provides for the transition to new <i>procedures</i> in the case of an alien already in exclusion or deportation proceedings on the effective date.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, p. 222 (1996)) (emphasis in original). In other words, according to the Supreme Court, &#167; 309(c) provides only that IIRIRA does not apply to removal <i>proceedings</i> that were <i>pending</i> on April 1, 1997. <i>See also Zadvydas,</i> 185 F.3d at 286-87 &amp; n. 7 (\"[T]he natural reading of the clause would thus seem to be that it applies only to proceedings that are pending as of the effective date.\"); <i>cf.

Normally, after a final order of removal has been entered against an alien, the government must remove the alien from the United States within a 90-day statutory removal period, during which the alien is held in custody. 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1231(a)(1)(A) (2000) (\"Except as otherwise provided in the section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the `removal period').\") &amp; (2) (\"During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien.\"); <i>see also Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) provides, however, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> In <i>Zadvydas,</i> the Supreme Court addressed the detention of two aliens who had been removed on grounds of deportability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Concluding that \"[a] statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem,\" the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court read the provision to limit \"an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The Court then recognized six months as a presumptively reasonable period of post-removal-period detention. <i>Id.</i> at 699-702, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Because we are assessing the same provision of IIRIRA that the Supreme Court considered in <i>Zadvydas,</i> the petitioners ask us simply to apply to them the reasonableness limitation the Supreme Court read into the provision in <i>Zadvydas.</i> The government contends, however, that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court's construction of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) does not apply to Rosales and Carballo because the detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility does not raise the same constitutional concerns as the detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the plain language of the provision, we find it difficult to believe that the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> could interpret &#167; 1231(a)(6) as containing a reasonableness limitation for aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability but not for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility. Section 1231(a)(6) itself does not draw any distinction between the categories of removable aliens; nor would there be any statutory reason to interpret \"detained beyond the removal period\" differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. <i>See Brown v. Gardner,</i> 513 U.S. 115, 118, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (discussing presumption that a statutory term retains the same meaning throughout a statute and in particular throughout a provision). The Ninth Circuit recently addressed this issue, and it concluded that the Supreme Court's construction of &#167; 1231(a)(6) in <i>Zadvydas</i> applied to an inadmissible, formerly excludable, alien. <i>See Lin Guo Xi v. INS,</i> 298 F.3d 832, 834 (9th Cir.2002). (\"We are now presented with the question of whether [8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6)] bears the same meaning for an individual deemed inadmissible to the United States under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182. The answer is yes.\"). The court in <i>Lin Guo Xi</i> explained that \"[s]ection 1231(a)(6) ... does not draw any distinction between individuals who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and those removable on grounds of deportability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 835.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not believe that the Supreme Court intended to construe &#167; 1231(a)(6) differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability.

Aliens who have not yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different question.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491. In addition, the government looks to the portion of <i>Zadvydas</i> in which the Court distinguished its decision in <i>Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,</i> 345 U.S. 206, S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953). <i>See Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 693-95, 121 S.Ct. 2491.

Furthermore, in stating that the statute does not permit indefinite detention, the Court referred generally to aliens as opposed to aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability: \"[i]n our view, the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits <i>an alien's</i> post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about <i>that alien's</i> removal from the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> the government in the instant cases \"has offered no authority suggesting that a litigant may not take advantage of a statutory interpretation that was guided by the principle of constitutional avoidance when that litigant's case does not present the constitutional problem that prompted the statutory interpretation.\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 839. In a case addressing a remarkably similar issue of statutory construction, the Third Circuit recently stated that \"[i]t simply cannot be that the meaning will change depending on the background or pedigree of the petitioner. Were we to so hold, we would render the meaning of any statute as changeable as the currents of the sea, and potentially as cruel and capricious.\" <i>Chmakov v.

The Supreme Court in <i>St. Cyr</i> held that, notwithstanding certain provisions of IIRIRA and AEDPA, aliens who had been ordered deported on the basis of criminal convictions could petition the federal courts for habeas relief from their deportation decisions. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 298-314, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The Court in <i>St. Cyr</i> interpreted IIRIRA and AEDPA not to preclude federal habeas jurisdiction both because such preclusion raised serious constitutional concerns under the Suspension Clause and because there was no clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent to preclude habeas. In <i>Chmakov,</i> the government argued that although the <i>St. Cyr</i> Court had interpreted IIRIRA and AEDPA not to repeal federal habeas jurisdiction over <i>criminal</i> deportees, the Court's interpretation of those statutes did not apply to the Chmakovs because, as <i>non-criminal</i> deportees, the Suspension Clause could not be a cause for constitutional concern. <i>Chmakov,</i> 266 F.3d at 215. The Third Circuit responded to this argument by first stating that \"[t]hat argument borders on the nonsensical,\" and the court then held that \"Congress has preserved the right to habeas review for both criminal and noncriminal aliens.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that <i>Zadvydas</i> Court did not actually distinguish between aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability in its analysis of the constitutional concerns raised by the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. The Court only refers to \"admission\" at the outset of the opinion; in its discussion of the constitutional concern raised by the statute, the Court distinguishes between aliens who have \"entered\" the United States and those who have not. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 682, 692, 121 S.Ct. 2491. As we explained above, <i>see supra</i> note 1, \"admission\" is a defining principle in IIRIRA, whereas \"entry\" was a defining principle in pre-IIRIRA immigration law. In its briefs in the instant appeal, as in <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> the government implies that \"the central operating terms of the two statutes are functionally the same &#8212; namely ... that `entry' and `admission' are interchangeable and that `excludable' and inadmissible' are interchangeable.\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 838. As we also explained above in note 1, however, these terms are <i>not</i> interchangeable. <i>See also id.</i> Admission is defined as \"the <i>lawful</i> entry of [an] alien into the United States,\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(A) (2000) (emphasis added); aliens who enter this country illegally and who were formerly classified as \"deportable\" are now classified as \"inadmissible.\" Therefore, to the extent that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court distinguished between categories of aliens in its analysis of the constitutional concerns raised by the statute, it distinguished only between excludable and deportable aliens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained above that, on the basis of the plain language of the statute, we do not believe that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court could construe the statute differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. It is even less conceivable, therefore, that the Court construed the statute differently for excludable and deportable aliens. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress not only abolished the use of the term \"excludable,\" but it also abolished that category of alien. \"The INA is no longer denominated in terms of `entry' and `exclusion.' IIRIRA replaced these terms with the broader concept of `admission.'\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 838; <i>see also id.</i> (\"We simply cannot ignore that `excludable' is no longer a term that has any statutory import under the INA.\"). To accept the government's argument that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court's construction of &#167; 1231(a)(6) does not apply to Rosales and Carballo, therefore, we would have to conclude that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court interpreted a statute currently in force to apply differently to a category of alien that no longer exists in immigration law. Without explicit instruction by the Court, we will not reach such a conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the court in <i>Lin Guo Xi</i> concluded, \"[t]he clear text of the statute, coupled with the Supreme Court's categorical interpretation, leaves us little choice but to conclude that <i>Zadvydas</i> applies to inadmissible individuals like Lin Guo Xi. The statute, on its face, makes no exceptions for inadmissible aliens. The Supreme Court's unqualified holding provides that the statute `does not permit indefinite detention.'\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 836 (quoting <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491); <i>see also Borrero v.

The Court then held that \"the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. It does not permit indefinite detention.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491. \"A statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem.

And in <i>Mezei,</i> the Court held that: It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after <i>proceedings</i> conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.

The fact that excludable aliens are entitled to less process, however, does not mean that they are not at all protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. If excludable aliens were not protected by even the substantive component of constitutional due process, as the government appears to argue, we do not see why the United States government could not torture or summarily execute them. Because we do not believe that our Constitution could permit persons living in the United States &#8212; whether they can be admitted for permanent residence or not &#8212; to be subjected to <i>any</i> government action without limit, we conclude that government treatment of excludable aliens <i>must</i> implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

So-called `substantive due process' prevents the government from engaging in conduct that `shocks the conscience' or interferes with rights `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' When government action depriving a person of life, liberty, or property survives substantive due process scrutiny, it must still be implemented in a fair manner. This requirement has traditionally been referred to as `procedural' due process.\" <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (citations omitted). The <i>Zadvydas</i> Court reiterated that \"[f]reedom from imprisonment &#8212; from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint &#8212; lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process] Clause protects.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 690, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (citing <i>Foucha v.

In <i>Zadvydas,</i> the Court determined that the detention of removable aliens by the INS is \"civil, not criminal, and we assume that [it is] nonpunitive in purpose and effect.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court then looked to the regulatory goals of the statute to determine whether they constituted sufficient \"special justification\" to outweigh the aliens' interest in avoiding detention. According to the government's brief in <i>Zadvydas,</i> the regulatory goals of IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision are \"`ensuring the appearance of aliens at future immigration proceedings' and `[p]reventing danger to the community.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 24). The Court concluded that the flight prevention justification was \"weak or nonexistent where removal seems a remote possibility at best,\" and the dangerousness justification could not be supported by alien status alone. <i>Id.</i> at 690-91, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Explaining that \"[i]n cases in which preventive detention is of potentially <i>indefinite</i> duration, we have also demanded that the dangerousness rationale be accompanied by some other special circumstance, such as mental illness, that helps to create the danger,\" the Court held that an alien's status as removable did not constitute such a special circumstance because it \"bears no relation to a detainee's dangerousness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 691-92, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales's and Carballo's status as excludable aliens does not alter the above analysis. An excludable alien who cannot be removed to his country of origin presents no greater risk of flight than the aliens who could not be removed to their countries of origin in <i>Zadvydas,</i> nor does an excludable alien's status relate any more to his dangerousness than the removable status of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas</i> related to their dangerousness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> However, the government contends that because Rosales and Carballo are excludable aliens, their detention should not be subject to the same analysis as the detention of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas.</i> According to the government, because excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States, the INS must be permitted to detain them indefinitely if they cannot be removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to enter or be admitted to the United States; indeed, no alien has a constitutional right to enter or be admitted to the United States. We also recognize that the INS is faced with an extremely difficult situation in the case of aliens who legally <i>cannot</i> enter or be admitted to the United States, yet who, by virtue of the fact that their country of origin will not repatriate them, are <i>in</i> the United States. However, the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> confronted much the same situation. Aliens who are removed on grounds of deportability do not have a constitutional right to stay in the United States, and, as the Court recognized, Congress has plenary power to create immigration law. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 695-96, 121 S.Ct. 2491. \"But that power is subject to important constitutional limitations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 695, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Like the Supreme Court, we do not question \"the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject them to supervision with conditions when released from detention, or to incarcerate them where appropriate for violations of those conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Rather, the issue we address is whether aliens that the Government finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned to an indefinite term of imprisonment within the United States.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> concluded that \"for the reasons we have set forth, we believe that an alien's liberty interest is, at the least, strong enough to raise a serious question as to whether, irrespective of the procedures used, the Constitution permits detention that is indefinite and potentially permanent.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696, 121 S.Ct. 2491. We draw the same conclusion with regard to excludable aliens. If the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to Rosales and Carballo, as we believe that it must, we do not see how we could conclude that the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of Rosales and Carballo raises any less serious constitutional concerns than the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas.</i> We emphasize that we understand that this situation, involving criminal aliens whose removal cannot be effected, is a difficult one: we, too, find it unpalatable that inadmissible aliens who have previously abused the privilege of immigration parole should be permitted additional opportunities to live in this country simply because their country of origin will not have them back. As the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court explained, though, \"[t]he choice ... is not between imprisonment and the alien `living at large.' It is between imprisonment and supervision under release conditions that may not be violated.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> Moreover, we find it not only unpalatable but also untenable to conclude that under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment persons living in the United States &#8212; whether by our choice or not &#8212; could be subjected to a life sentence in prison simply because their country of origin will not have them back. A life sentence in prison, in fact, seems to us no less impermissible than the government's torture or summary execution of these aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also argues that in <i>Mezei,</i> the Supreme Court held that the indefinite detention of an excludable alien was permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the government further argues that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court reaffirmed <i>Mezei.</i> We note at the outset that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court explicitly refused to address the continuing validity of <i>Mezei:</i> \"we need not consider the aliens' claim that subsequent developments have undermined <i>Mezei's</i> legal authority.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 694, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Inasmuch as the Court in <i>Mezei</i> permitted the potentially indefinite detention of an excludable alien, however, we agree with the government that we must address <i>Mezei's</i> ramifications for Rosales and Carballo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> We believe that <i>Mezei</i> does not govern the outcome of the instant cases for two reasons. First, the <i>Mezei</i> Court explicitly grounded its decision in the special circumstances of a national emergency and the determination by the Attorney General that Mezei presented a threat to national security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> The Court, in fact, located the Attorney General's authority to exclude and detain Mezei in the Passport Act of 1918. <i>Mezei,</i> 345 U.S. at 210-11, 73 S.Ct. 625 (\"Congress expressly authorized the President to impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or leaving the United States during periods of international tension and strife. That authorization, originally enacted in the Passport Act of 1918, continues in effect during the present emergency.\"). Moreover, in regard to the proposition that Mezei be released on immigration parole, the Court stated: \"An exclusion proceeding <i>grounded on danger to the national security ...</i> presents different considerations; neither the rationale nor the statutory authority for such release exists.\" <i>Id.</i> at 216, 73 S.Ct. 625. Particularly in a post-September 11 world, we recognize that in special circumstances prolonged post-removal-period detention may be warranted. <i>See Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (\"Neither do we consider terrorism or other special circumstances where special arguments might be made for forms of preventive detention and for heightened deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters of national security.\"). There are, however, no special circumstances involving national security in the instant cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we believe that the Court's implicit conclusion in <i>Mezei</i> is eclipsed by the conclusion drawn from the <i>Salerno</i> line of cases that the indefinite detention of excludable aliens does raise constitutional concerns. All of the cases that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court relied on in assessing the constitutional due process concerns implicated by the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability were decided after <i>Mezei. See, e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); <i>Foucha v. Louisiana,</i> 504 U.S. 71, 112 S.Ct. 1780, 118 L.Ed.2d 437 (1992); <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987); <i>Jackson v. Indiana,</i> 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972). In these cases, the contours of constitutionally permissible civil detention are rigorously delineated &#8212; a substantial jurisprudential development from the time that <i>Mezei</i> was decided. As we explained above, the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court held on the basis of these cases that civil detention is constitutionally permissible only \"in certain special and narrow nonpunitive circumstances where a special justification... outweighs the individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 690, 121 S.Ct. 2491. As we also explained above, we do not believe that any such special circumstances outweigh Rosales's and Carballo's interest in avoiding indefinite and potentially permanent INS detention. Although we must &#8212; as a lower federal court &#8212; apply all pertinent Supreme Court precedent, it is not our role to reconcile cases whose application leads to opposite conclusions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> Therefore, to the extent that we could conclude, in reliance on the Court's holding in <i>Mezei,</i> that the indefinite detention of excludable aliens is constitutionally permissible, we believe such a conclusion to be fatally undermined by the Court's later decisions in the <i>Salerno</i> line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Therefore, prior to construing &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) to contain a reasonable time limitation, the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court addressed whether Congress had clearly indicated an intent in the statute to authorize indefinite post-removal-period detention of aliens whose removal cannot be effected. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696-99, 121 S.Ct. 2491. After reviewing the history of the statute, the Court concluded that \"[w]e have found nothing in the history of these statutes that clearly demonstrates a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention. Consequently, interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutional threat, we conclude that, once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491. We again see no reason to interpret the statute any differently for excludable aliens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas,</i> then, we recognize six months as a presumptively reasonable period for the post-removal detention of excludable aliens. \"After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. In the instant cases, we conclude that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. Although the government presented evidence of our continuing negotiations with Cuba over the return of Cuban nationals excluded from the United States, neither Rosales nor Carballo is currently on a list of persons to be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Because there is no significant likelihood that Rosales and Carballo will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future and because the INS has detained them longer than six months, we conclude that the INS's detention of Rosales and Carballo is no longer reasonable and is therefore not authorized by IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision. We REVERSE the district courts' denials of Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions, and we REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\") substantially altered the landscape in immigration law. \"Among the changes brought by the IIRIRA was a shift in basic immigration terminology.\"<i>Chi Thon Ngo v.

An alien who does not enter the United States legally is not \"admitted.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13) (2000). \"Inadmissible\" aliens, therefore, include aliens who have not entered the United States (formerly excludable) and those who entered illegally (formerly deportable). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(6) (2000).

Doe,</i> 484 U.S. 305, 320, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). However, as discussed above, the INS can revoke Rosales's parole for a number of reasons &#8212; some of which are within Rosales's control, but some of which are not. In <i>Olmstead v. Zimring,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999), mentally disabled patients challenged their confinement in segregated as opposed to community-based programs. Although the patients were in community-based programs by the time the case was heard, the Court held that \"in view of the multiple institutional placements [the patients] have experienced, the controversy they brought to court is `capable of repetition, yet evading review.'\" <i>Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 594 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 2176. Because Rosales's parole could be revoked for reasons that are not within his control, his parole is more like the institutional placement described in <i>Olmstead</i> than parole in the traditional, criminal sense as described in <i>Spencer,</i> 523 U.S. at 15, 118 S.Ct. 978, in which the parolee can control whether his parole is revoked.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We note that the government does not claim that Carballo's recent placement in a residential substance-abuse recovery program moots his case.

Operating Corp.,</i> 486 U.S. 800, 817, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (\"[A] district court's adherence to law of the case cannot insulate an issue from appellate review.\"). We note, however, that it is not at all clear to us that the law-of-the-case doctrine should apply to successive habeas petitions. \"Law-of-the-case rules have developed to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing lawsuit.\" 18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4478 (2d ed.2002). Whether successive habeas petitions constitute stages in a single, continuing lawsuit is a question that should be carefully considered. <i>See Lacy v.

In <i>McCleskey,</i> 499 U.S. at 493-94, 111 S.Ct. 1454, the Court required a showing of \"cause and prejudice,\" developed in the context of procedural default, by prisoners filing second or subsequent habeas petitions that raise new claims. <i>Sawyer v. Whitley,</i> 505 U.S. 333, 339, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992), extended this requirement to prisoners filing successive habeas petitions. <i>See also Schlup,</i> 513 U.S. at 318, 115 S.Ct. 851 (\"[A] habeas court may not ordinarily reach the merits of successive claims ... absent a showing of cause and prejudice.\") (citation omitted). Carballo, however, is not being detained on the basis of a criminal conviction under either state or federal law.

Therefore, we conclude that the Court's cause and prejudice requirement does not apply to Carballo.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note that if the cause and prejudice requirement did apply to Carballo, we would conclude that he has cause to file a successive habeas petition. The Ninth Circuit has construed \"cause\" in the context of successive habeas petitions to mean \"cause for bringing a petition that fails to present a new ground for relief. In other words, a petitioner must show cause for seeking review of the same claim twice &#8212; such as the discovery of new facts, or an intervening change in the law, that warrants reexamination of the same ground for relief raised in an earlier petition.\" <i>Campbell v.

Arguably, the Court has limited this exception for prisoners challenging their state or federal convictions to cases in which \"the petitioner `establish[es] that under the probative evidence he has a colorable claim of factual innocence.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Kuhlmann,</i> 477 U.S. at 454, 106 S.Ct. 2616).

Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 420, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999), is beside the point because that decision simply observed that the new rules would not apply to a proceeding filed <i>before</i> IIRIRA's effective date.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 318 n. 42, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (emphasis in original). In <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> the Court had noted in regard to an alien deported prior to IIRIRA's effective date that \"[t]he parties agree IIRIRA does not govern respondent's case,\" and it cited IIRIRA &#167; 309(c). <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 420, 119 S.Ct. 1439. We emphasize that <i>Aguirre-Aguirre</i> involved an alien's challenge to his deportation <i>proceeding.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). At least one other circuit has invoked <i>Chevron</i> in the context of determining which statute to assess in an excluded or deported alien's petition for habeas relief from detention. <i>See Zadvydas,</i> 185 F.3d at 286-87. We, however, do not believe that <i>Chevron</i> applies in this context. First, the government has only advocated in litigation the application of pre-IIRIRA law to petitioners like Rosales and Carballo. An interpretation contained in a brief &#8212; like interpretations contained in opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines &#8212; lacks the force of law and is therefore not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See Christensen v. Harris County,</i> 529 U.S. 576, 586-87, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000). Second, although the government's position is entitled to respect pursuant to <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), we conclude that the government's position has been inconsistent and is therefore unpersuasive. <i>See Christensen,</i> 529 U.S. at 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In a number of other cases in which excluded, deported, or removed aliens challenged the legality of their continued detention, the government argued that IIRIRA should apply to alien petitioners who had been excluded or deported prior to April 1, 1997. <i>See, e.g., Sierra v. INS,</i> 258 F.3d 1213, 1216 n. 2 (10th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 1071, 122 S.Ct. 676, 151 L.Ed.2d 589 (2001); <i>Zadvydas,</i> 185 F.3d at 286. Inasmuch as shifting agency interpretations issued in <i>regulations</i> are accorded less deference under the highly deferential <i>Chevron</i> standard, <i>see INS v.

Pre-IIRIRA, Zadvydas was classified as deportable, <i>see Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 684, 121 S.Ct. 2491, and Kim Ho Ma would have been classified as deportable.

In <i>Mezei,</i> an excludable alien was denied reentry into the United States at Ellis Island and ordered excluded; because other countries would not take him in, Mezei was detained on Ellis Island. After one year of detention, Mezei filed a habeas petition in a federal district court claiming that his exclusion without a hearing violated his constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <i>Mezei,</i> 345 U.S. at 207, 73 S.Ct. 625. The Supreme Court held that Mezei, as an excludable alien, was not entitled to a hearing: \"Whatever the <i>procedure</i> authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\" <i>Id.</i> at 212, 73 S.Ct. 625 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added); <i>see also Kim Ho Ma v.

The <i>Mezei</i> Court then went on to hold that \"we do not think that respondent's <i>continued exclusion</i> deprives him of any statutory or constitutional right.\" <i>id.</i> at 215, 73 S.Ct. 625 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the Court in <i>Mezei,</i> therefore, did not address indefinite or potentially indefinite <i>detention</i> as a violation of Mezei's substantive due process rights. Inasmuch as Rosales and Carballo do not challenge their exclusion, we believe that their cases present a different question. We recognize, however, that other circuits have not read <i>Mezei</i> in this way. <i>See, e.g., Carrera-Valdez,</i> 211 F.3d at 1048 (stating that the <i>Mezei</i> Court \"held that an excludable alien may be detained indefinitely when his country of origin will not accept his return\"); <i>Kim Ho Ma,</i> 208 F.3d at 823 (\"[T]he Court held that Mezei could be detained indefinitely on Ellis Island.\"). Moreover, the Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> noted that \"<i>Mezei,</i> like the present cases, involves indefinite detention.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 693, 121 S.Ct. 2491.

In <i>Salerno,</i> the Court specifically stated that national emergencies could constitute a special justification that would outweigh an individual's constitutionally protected liberty interest. <i>See Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. at 748, 107 S.Ct. 2095 (\"[I]n times of war or insurrection, when society's interest is at its peak, the Government may detain individuals whom the government believes to be dangerous.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn35\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35_ref\">35</a>\n        <p> We reiterate that in enacting IIRIRA, Congress itself abolished the distinction between deportable and excludable aliens<i>See infra</i> note 1.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOGGS, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding these two consolidated cases today, the court makes two holdings that are both quite striking, novel and, in my opinion, incorrect. I therefore respectfully dissent. The court first finds that Congress, in the course of enacting a statute that virtually all concede was designed to tighten immigration procedures, instead amended the statute in such a way as to obliterate a longstanding distinction that recognized the lessened constitutional protection of persons who had been affirmatively denied entry into the United States, detained at the border, and physically allowed inside the country only as a matter of legislative grace. Instead, the court finds that Congress deliberately accorded such persons the same status as long-time permanent residents. Second, and perhaps even more disturbing, the court essentially accords such persons <i>all</i> of the due process rights of American citizens. The court therefore makes it impossible, in our circuit at least, for the United States government to detain for more than six months any number of aliens who present themselves at our border and are denied entry, or are paroled into the United States only conditionally. It further extends this status regardless of whatever criminal acts those persons may have committed. I believe that this result cannot be derived from the text of the Constitution and is contrary to existing Supreme Court precedent, which the Supreme Court has recently explicitly relied on and refused to overrule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with the broader holding, the court finds that full due process applies to all persons at or within the borders of the United States, and that such due process is not merely procedural, but essentially accords any such person a right to remain at liberty in the United States comparable to that accorded to United States citizens. It does this by commencing with the unremarkable proposition that the government may not wantonly execute or torture a person, and then extrapolates that the government is disabled from applying its immigration and criminal laws to such excludable aliens in ways that are different from those that apply to deportable aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding has nothing to do with what we would generally classify as \"process.\" Rosales and Carballo have had that, in abundance. They have been able to argue, before independent arbiters, that they are not the persons to whom the law is intended to apply, that they do not come within the reach of the law, and any other procedural issues they may wish to raise. They have had this review before the various levels of the administrative bureaucracy prescribed by Congress and before the courts of the United States. It cannot be disputed that Rosales and Garcia are both \"excludable\" aliens in that they sought admission to the United States, were detained at the border before entering the United States, and were paroled into the United States only as a matter of grace and on the condition that their parole may be revoked at any time, and especially for the commission of criminal offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the many agencies and courts to have considered their cases have ruled that they come within the mandate of Congress that persons who are \"excludable\" and have committed crimes of sufficient seriousness should be removed from the United States and, if not immediately deportable, be detained at the discretion of the Attorney General. There is little doubt that Carballo and Rosales fit in this category of excludable aliens who have committed serious offenses. Simply to detail the crimes of which they have been convicted, and others of which they have been arrested, makes this abundantly clear. The highlights of Rosales's criminal career include arrests for aggravated battery, possession of marijuana, burglary and loitering and convictions for possession of marijuana, resisting arrest, grand theft, burglary, grand larceny, escape from a penal institution, and conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine. Op. at 392. Carballo, no less prolific, has been arrested for aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny, battery, carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm, trespass, and possession of marijuana. He has been convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery. Op. at 393. If this law cannot be applied to these persons, it seems clear that no alien, no matter his degree of criminality, can be subject to this law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court provides a number of soothing statements as to how certain actions against such aliens might be permissible, but it provides no principled reasons for such distinctions, nor a square holding that in fact they can be implemented. May parole conditions for excludable alien criminals be more onerous than for citizens? It implies that they may be, by referring to parole conditions and practices applied to Rosales that are not (and constitutionally may not be) applied to criminals on parole. Op. at 395 &amp; nn. 7-8. However, the opinion provides no basis for such a distinction. May Congress prescribe indefinite detention as a punishment for any violation of such conditions when similar punishment does not apply to citizen parole-violators? No answer is given. A careful reading of the court's logic and rhetoric would indicate that the very same type of attack that is mounted against the congressional mandate here would be found congenial by this court when mounted against any such distinction. Would any more draconian punishment, such as that suggested above, or an enactment that excludable aliens could be detained indefinitely as punishment for any criminal infraction, pass the muster of this court, under its broad rubric of due process, or under its application of the Eighth Amendment? In oral argument, it was indicated that any violation of parole, under current law, was punishable by at most one year's additional detention. Would it violate the Ex Post Facto Clause for any alien already excluded from this country to have applied to him indefinite detention? Again, no logic is given that would answer the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's approach leads to a host of practical problems, both at the level of this circuit and of the nation. As the court indicates, we have jurisdiction only because the INS happened to choose to detain these aliens within the boundaries of this circuit, at FCI Memphis and at Lexington. Op. at 392, 394. Since our holding is generally at odds with those of most other circuits, and explicitly at odds with four other circuits, it may well be that the INS will simply choose to remove from the Sixth Circuit all those aliens to whom this dictate would apply. <i>Carrera-Valdez v.

The Supreme Court, in determining the scope of due process rights of aliens, has consistently distinguished between deportable and excludable aliens. In <i>Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,</i> 345 U.S. 206, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953), the Court definitively held that excludable aliens, unlike aliens who are merely deportable, have no constitutional right against indefinite detention in the event that they cannot be returned to their country of origin. Indeed, the circumstances of Mezei were far more compelling than those of Rosales and Carballo. Mezei had committed no crime. He had been a longtime resident of the United States, and had always been law abiding during that time. He simply went abroad for a period of 19 months, and was detained at the border when he returned. The Supreme Court held that he could be detained indefinitely, if no country could be found to take him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), the Supreme Court reinforced the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens. There, the Court suggested that deportable aliens may have a constitutional right against indefinite detention. <i>Id.</i> at 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (suggesting that \"indefinite detention beyond the time necessary for removal\" of deportable aliens \"would raise serious constitutional concerns\"). But the Court carefully restricted its concerns to deportable aliens. As the Court explained, \"the distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the United States and one who has never entered runs throughout immigration law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 691, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Specifically, the Court recognized again that \"it is well established that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the United States are unavailable to persons outside of our geographic borders,\" including those who have not formally \"entered\" the United States, such as excludable aliens paroled into the United States. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court specifically indicated that it was not questioning the validity of <i>Mezei,</i> and noted that the case of <i>Zadvydas</i> \"differed in a <i>critical</i> respect\" from <i>Mezei</i> exactly because Mezei had been detained at the border, while Zadvydas had entered the United States. <i>Id.</i> at 693, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has recently and emphatically instructed us that we should leave the overruling of Supreme Court precedents to that Court, even if we believe, or divine, that the Court should, or will, overrule them. <i>Agostini v. Felton,</i> 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). No matter how much the court may disagree with the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens, it simply cannot be disputed that the controlling Supreme Court precedent makes that distinction and holds that excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to be permitted to remain in the United States at liberty if their removal cannot be seasonably obtained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding, applying as it does to persons with very extensive criminal records, would obviously apply to persons otherwise blameless, who have simply been detained attempting to enter the United States: After a maximum of six months, if such persons can not be sent elsewhere, they would have to be released into the United States, with some possible exception for individualized determinations. Thus, if hundreds, or thousands, or hundreds of thousands of such persons present themselves at our borders, this court holds that the government of the United States is constitutionally disabled from doing anything, after a short interval, other than set all such persons at liberty in our country. While this result could be good policy, it seems inconceivable that such a disabling of congressional policy choices is consistent with a fair reading of the Immigration and Naturalization Clause of the Constitution, <i>see, e.g., Galvan v. Press,</i> 347 U.S. 522, 531, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954) (\"That the formulation of [policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here] is entrusted exclusively to Congress has become about as firmly imbedded in the legislative and judicial tissues of our body politic as any aspect of our government\"), or with the intent of anyone in adopting the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The process that is due to persons to whom the government has explicitly denied entry into the country is quite different from what is due to others, as a matter of constitutional law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the statutory argument, the court essentially makes two points. The first is that since the language of IIRIRA uses the term \"inadmissible,\" it has, therefore, abolished the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens, for all purposes. Op. at 407-408. The court also remarkably concludes, by holding that the statute does not permit indefinite detention for excludable aliens as well, that Congress abolished the distinction with the result of giving excludable aliens the same rights as deportable aliens. Of course, Congress had quite the contrary intention: it sought to tighten immigration regulations. As Congress itself provided in the text of the statute, courts were not to construe IIRIRA to \"create any procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(h). The intent of Congress is clear that it had intended, by using the language of \"inadmissibility,\" to subject deportable aliens to the same potential for indefinite detention, if they could not be removed after the commission of a serious crime, that excludable aliens had been subject to both statutorily and constitutionally for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's development of a \"reasonable time\" limitation for the detention of \"excludable\" aliens is based wholly on the Supreme Court's effective rewriting of the statute <i>for deportable aliens,</i> which is all that the Court had before it in <i>Zadvydas.</i> Applying this reasonable time limitation to excludable aliens misunderstands the Supreme Court's analysis in <i>Zadvydas</i> and, more fundamentally, the canon of constitutional avoidance. The Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> did not hold that the text, or even the legislative history, of the statute indicated Congress's intent to place a reasonable time limitation on the detention of \"deportable\" aliens. 533 U.S. at 697-98, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Instead, the Court employed the canon of construction that Congress does not intend for its statutes to raise serious constitutional problems, also known as the canon of constitutional avoidance. <i>Id.</i> at 698, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Specifically, the Court relied on the statutory text that the Attorney General \"may\" detain individuals after the removal period. <i>Id.</i> at 697, 121 S.Ct. 2491. For the Court, this permissive language did not necessarily confer unfettered discretion on the Attorney General to detain aliens, but must have meant, because of the canon of constitutional avoidance, that the Attorney General should exercise his discretion within constitutional limits. Of course, as demonstrated above, governing Supreme Court precedent, including <i>Zadvydas,</i> clearly indicates that there is no constitutional limit on the detention of excludable aliens. Thus, the Attorney General \"may,\" in his discretion, detain excludable aliens beyond the ninety-day removal period, and the detention need not comply with the reasonable time limitation that cabins his discretion with regard to deportable aliens arising from the canon of constitutional avoidance and nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, its merits aside, the canon of constitutional avoidance has historically contemplated precisely such a result. From the beginnings of statutory construction in federal courts, the Supreme Court has held that \"an Act of Congress ought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible construction remains available.\" <i>See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop,</i> 440 U.S. 490, 500, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979) (discussing the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in <i>Murray v. The Charming Betsy,</i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 2 L.Ed. 208 (1804)). The canon of constitutional avoidance is a majoritarian default rule. That is, the canon draws its legitimacy from the premise that Congress generally does not intend for its statutes to exceed constitutional limits. But this supposition cannot be significantly expanded without straining the justification beyond reason. Congress often intends to legislate <i>to,</i> even if not <i>beyond,</i> the limitations of the Constitution. If the canon of constitutional avoidance is to be justifiable, it must at least permit Congress to legislate to the limits of what is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no textual source for the Supreme Court's application of a specific time limitation to the Attorney General's discretion to detain aliens under IIRIRA. Instead, the word \"may\" on which the Supreme Court focused in <i>Zadvydas,</i> if the canon of constitutional avoidance is to have any meaning, permits the Attorney General to detain beyond the removal period, but only as allowed by the Constitution. And the Supreme Court is clear that the Constitution does not grant \"excludable\" aliens a right to release into the United States after a \"reasonable time.\" Thus, that \"deportable\" aliens may only be detained for a \"reasonable time\" after the removal period but \"excludable\" aliens may be detained indefinitely is not only a consistent, but the required, reading of &#167; 1231(a)(6) in the context of the canon of constitutional avoidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, our court's holding that extends the \"reasonable time\" limitation to excludable aliens is a classic example of the tail wagging the dog. The Supreme Court rewrites a statute with respect to one class of persons, to avoid constitutional doubts, and we are then required to read the statute in the same way in cases where there are no constitutional doubts. This does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I freely grant that there is some anomaly in having the same words mean different things when applied to different groups of people. However, that is a natural consequence of an aggressive application of the constitutional-doubt standard, implemented by a conceded rewriting of the statute, rather than by choosing between plausible alternatives. And, while certainly not conclusive, the fact that the Supreme Court chose to vacate our previous decision in <i>Rosales-Garcia,</i> which followed the same logic as the court displays today, is some indication that that result is not lambently clear to the Supreme Court. <i>Thoms v. Rosales-Garcia,</i> 534 U.S. 1063, 122 S.Ct. 662, 151 L.Ed.2d 577 (mem.), <i>vacating and remanding Rosales-Garcia v. Holland,</i> 238 F.3d 704 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interestingly, Justice Kennedy noted this dilemma in his dissenting opinion. He did characterize both alternatives as unsustainable, but the nature of the situation requires us to accept one or the other. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 710-11, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Under these circumstances, I believe it does far less violence to the language of the statute, to congressional intent, and to a proper understanding of the canon of constitutional avoidance to confront the words of the statute and interpret them according to their tenor, in a case where any \"constitutional doubt\" is far less than in <i>Zadvydas,</i> assuming that there is any doubt whatsoever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, today's decision, perhaps out of a misplaced concern for the individuals before us, grossly distorts the meaning of a statute, and greatly diminishes the range of policy choices available to the political branches in a field uniquely committed to their discretion. Whether indefinite detention of persons as incorrigible as Rosales and Carballo is good policy is not for us to decide. It is a matter for Congress, subject at most to a requirement that some procedural fairness be applied under the Due Process Clause, a requirement that has been amply fulfilled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p> One of the most perceptive commentators on<i>Mezei</i> argued eloquently for a more nuanced approach that would elide and break down this rigid distinction, based on a number of interesting factors.

Both Petitioners, Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed from the United States, are currently in the indefinite and potentially permanent custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") because Cuba refuses to allow them to return.

Finally, we conclude that even if the Supreme Court's construction of IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and Carballo, their indefinite detention independently raises constitutional concerns, and we construe IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision as it applies to Rosales and Carballo to contain an implicit reasonable-time limitation. Because there is no significant likelihood of the petitioners' removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the continued detention of the petitioners by the INS is not authorized by the applicable statute, and we REVERSE the district courts' denials of their habeas petitions and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners-Appellants Mario Rosales-Garcia (\"Rosales\") and Reynero Arteaga Carballo (\"Carballo\") arrived in this country as part of the Mariel boatlift in 1980, during which over 120,000 Cubans crossed by boat from the Mariel harbor in Cuba to the United States. Rosales and Carballo, like most of the Mariel Cubans, arrived in this country without documentation permitting them legal entry; therefore, because they were not authorized to enter the country and because immigration officials stopped them at the border, they were deemed \"excludable\" under the immigration law in effect at the time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> Although excludable aliens have not \"entered\" the country for the purposes of immigration law, Rosales and Carballo were permitted physical entry into the United States pursuant to the Attorney General's authority under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) to grant immigration parole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As of 1986, this parole has been governed by regulations specifically promulgated by the INS for Mariel Cubans. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.12 (2002) (the \"Cuban Review Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their independent criminal convictions, the Attorney General, acting through the INS, revoked Rosales's and Carballo's parole and initiated exclusion proceedings against them. Both petitioners were excluded and, pursuant to the immigration law in effect at the time, they should have been immediately deported. Cuba, however, has refused to repatriate most of the Mariel Cubans whom the United States has excluded, and the U.S. government does not contend in this appeal that a repatriation by Cuba of either Rosales or Carballo is reasonably foreseeable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because Cuba refused to accept the deportation of either Rosales or Carballo, the INS has detained them in prisons in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rosales</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales was twenty-three when he arrived in the United States, and he was soon thereafter paroled into the custody of his aunt. Beginning in 1980, Rosales was arrested for a number of offenses, including aggravated battery, possession of marijuana, burglary, and loitering. Rosales was convicted of the following offenses: possession of marijuana and resisting arrest in October 1981; grand theft in September 1981, for which he received two years of probation in March 1983; burglary and grand larceny in October 1983, for which he received two six-month sentences, to be served consecutively; escape from a penal institution in February 1984, for which he received a 366-day sentence; and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine in March 1993, for which he received a sixty-three month federal prison sentence and five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1986, Rosales's immigration parole was revoked by the INS on the basis of the escape and grand larceny convictions, pursuant to INS authority under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) and 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.5(d)(2) (1986). In a separate proceeding before an immigration judge, Rosales was denied asylum and ordered excluded on June 26, 1987, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(20) (1982), for improper documentation. Rosales was in INS detention between July 1986 and May 1988, when he was again released on parole. After he pleaded guilty to the cocaine conspiracy charge in 1993, the INS revoked Rosales's parole, this time pursuant to the Cuban Review Plan. When Rosales was released from federal prison in May 1997, the INS detained him, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(e) (1994). Rosales remained in INS detention for four years, during which time he was denied parole twice, in November 1997 and March 1999, under the Cuban Review Plan. In April 2001, Rosales was granted parole and released into a halfway house program. Rosales completed the program in May 2001, and he was subsequently released into the community under conditions of supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosales filed his pro se habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on July 9, 1998. In the petition, he alleged that his \"continued incarceration is illegal, it violates Due Process, statu[t]es, and case law....\" Rosales Joint Appendix (\"Rosales J.A.\") at 9. The district court initially denied Rosales's habeas petition sua sponte in October of 1998; however, Rosales filed a motion to amend, and the district court vacated its initial denial. On May 3, 1999, the district court denied with prejudice Rosales's amended habeas petition. The court concluded that under the IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (Supp.V.1999), the Attorney General was authorized to detain Rosales indefinitely, and the court further concluded that such detention did not violate Rosales's constitutional substantive or procedural due process rights. In regard to Rosales's substantive due process claim, the court held that Rosales \"ha[d] no fundamental right to be free to roam the United States.\" Rosales J.A. at 91. With respect to Rosales's procedural due process claim, the court held that \"[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\" Rosales J.A. at 91 (quoting <i>United States ex rel.

By 1983, Carballo had been arrested sixteen times, for offenses including aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny, battery, carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm, trespassing, and possession of marijuana.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In April 1983, Carballo was convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery, for which he received a sentence of eight years for the murder, eight years for the robbery, and five years for the aggravated assault. During his incarceration, the INS initiated exclusion proceedings, and in September 1994, an immigration judge ordered Carballo excluded, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (crimes of moral turpitude), (a)(2)(B) (multiple criminal convictions), and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (improper documentation) (1994). Upon the completion of his sentence, in June of 1988, Carballo was taken into custody by the INS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He has been detained since then, although his status has been reviewed annually, pursuant to the Cuban Review Plan. While this case was pending, on December 17, 2002, Carballo was placed by the INS in a ninemonth residential substance-abuse program at the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1990, Carballo filed a pro se habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Carballo claimed that the Attorney General did not have the authority to detain him beyond a reasonable time to effect his exclusion and that his continued detention violated his constitutional substantive and procedural due process rights. A magistrate judge recommended that Carballo's petition be denied, and on November 26, 1991, the district court denied Carballo's petition. The district court concluded that the Attorney General had implied statutory authority to detain Carballo under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a) (1988). Addressing Carballo's constitutional claims, the court held that because Carballo's detention did not constitute punishment, it did not violate substantive due process. The court further held that Carballo was entitled to only as much procedural due process as Congress granted him. Carballo did not appeal this denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 1998, Carballo filed a successive habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. The district court denied Carballo's successive petition on May 10, 1999. After finding that Carballo raised the same claims in his successive habeas petition as he had raised in his original habeas petition, the court stated that the \"law of the case doctrine prevents this court from reconsidering petitioner's entirely repetitive claim.\" Carballo Joint Appendix (\"Carballo J.A.\") at 20. Carballo appealed this denial, and a panel of this court heard the case on March 9, 2001. On October 11, 2001, the panel affirmed the decision of the district court. On November 3, 2001, we sua sponte granted Carballo a rehearing en banc, vacating the decision of the panel.

Although Rosales's parole was not based on a criminal conviction, it imposes similarly restrictive conditions. <i>See</i> Rosales Supp. J.A. at 4-5 (Conditions of Parole). Therefore, we conclude that even though he has been paroled into the United States, Rosales is still in the custody of the INS for the purposes of his habeas petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry into whether Rosales's claim is moot cannot end, however, with a determination of custody. In <i>Spencer v.

Rosales petitioned the district court for habeas relief, alleging that his continued <i>detention</i> by the INS was impermissible on both statutory and constitutional grounds. We thus must ask whether Rosales's claim is moot because he is no longer being <i>detained</i> by the INS. \"The parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit. This means that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rosales is not currently being detained, his immigration parole can be revoked by the INS at any time for almost any reason.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> Unlike parole granted following incarceration for a criminal conviction, Rosales need not do anything for the INS to revoke his parole; for instance, the INS can revoke Rosales's parole if it deems such revocation to be \"in the public interest.\" <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 212.12(h) (2002). Thus, Rosales's \"release\" into the United States does not constitute a termination of detention; it simply constitutes a reprieve from detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> Under these circumstances, we believe that Rosales is threatened with an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.

First, the Supreme Court has held that \"[i]t is well settled that `a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.' ... `[I]f it did, the courts would be compelled to leave [t]he defendant... free to return to his old ways.'\" <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Second, the Court has long recognized an exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" This exception applies where \"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\" <i>Spencer,</i> 523 U.S. at 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3533.7 (2d ed.1984)). The Ninth Circuit has even held that a Mariel Cuban's parole did moot his habeas petition because, on the basis of government declarations, the court concluded that \"the alleged wrong will not recur.\" <i>Picrin-Peron v. Rison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559056\"><a href=\"/opinion/559056/lorenzo-alberto-picrin-peron-v-richard-h-rison-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>, 776 (9th Cir.1991). In <i>Picrin-Peron,</i> the government stated in its dismissal motion that \"[a]bsent Picrin's reinvolvement with the criminal justice system, a change in the Cuban government enabling him to return to Cuba, or the willingness of a third country to accept him, he will be paroled for another year,\" and an INS official reiterated the statement in a declaration made under oath. <i>Id.</i> The government in Rosales's case, however, has made no such promise, nor has the government made it \"absolutely clear\" in any other way that potentially indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS cannot reasonably be expected to recur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that the indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS is a case \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Because the INS can revoke Rosales's parole at any time and has in fact revoked Rosales's parole twice in the past fifteen years, there is a reasonable expectation that Rosales will again be subject to indefinite INS detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, because the INS can grant Rosales parole at any time, such detention can always evade review. The government argues that \"there is no basis for concluding that when a Mariel Cuban's parole is revoked, the alien will always be rereleased in a time that is so short that the legality of his detention will evade review.\" Gov't Supp. Br. re Rosales at 22-23. It is true that the Cuban Review Plan requires the INS to follow certain procedures before releasing a Mariel Cuban into the United States. However, the INS granted Rosales parole in the two years between the denial of his habeas petition by the district court and our review, and we have every reason to believe both that the INS could again accomplish a release in the same amount of time and that another habeas petition filed by Rosales would take at least as long as the instant case in arriving in this court. <i>See Honig v.

Although the post-removal-period detention provision of IIRIRA is in itself not substantially different from the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law, the Supreme Court's construction of IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision in <i>Zadvydas</i> is different from the construction of the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law that prevailed in most circuits at the time Carballo filed his original habeas petition. Therefore, Carballo is able in this habeas petition to raise legal arguments that he was unable to raise in his habeas petition in the Northern District of Texas. <i>See Collins v.

According to the government, &#167; 309(c)(1) of IIRIRA precludes us from applying IIRIRA to an alien excluded prior to the statute's effective date. Section 309(c)(1), entitled \"General rule that new rules do not apply,\" provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings before the title III-A effective date [April 1, 1997] &#8212; (A) the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply, and (B) the proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 (2000), note regarding \"Effective Dates\" (reprinting IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1)). Inasmuch as the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> did not discuss the application of IIRIRA to Zadvydas, we cannot simply assume that such application is appropriate for all aliens deported or excluded before April 1, 1997. We are persuaded for other reasons, however, that IIRIRA is the appropriate statute to assess in our review of the merits of Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and Carballo because, pursuant to &#167; 309(c), IIRIRA does not apply to aliens who were in exclusion or deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. It is not clear from the government's brief whether it believes this interpretation to be of the statute's retroactivity (i.e., that IIRIRA does not apply retroactively to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date) or of the statute's general applicability (i.e., that IIRIRA generally does not apply to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date). To the extent that the argument is one of IIRIRA's retroactivity, we do not believe that retroactivity is at issue in these appeals. In <i>Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock,</i> the Ninth Circuit considered the legality of an excludable alien's detention under the statute in effect at the time of the decision. <i>Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566431\"><a href=\"/opinion/566431/luis-alvarez-mendez-v-fred-j-stock-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 960 (9th Cir.1991), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agree with this reasoning. Rosales and Carballo are not challenging the legality of their original detention &#8212; they are challenging the INS's authority to detain them now. Therefore, whether IIRIRA <i>retroactively</i> authorizes Rosales's and Carballo's detention is irrelevant; we need only assess whether IIRIRA <i>currently</i> authorizes their detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the government's argument is one of IIRIRA's general applicability, the Supreme Court has stated that \"[s]ection 309(c)(1) is best read as merely setting out the <i>procedural</i> rules to be applied to removal proceedings pending on the effective date of the statute.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because we are assessing the same provision of IIRIRA that the Supreme Court considered in <i>Zadvydas,</i> the petitioners ask us simply to apply to them the reasonableness limitation the Supreme Court read into the provision in <i>Zadvydas.</i> The government contends, however, that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court's construction of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) does not apply to Rosales and Carballo because the detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility does not raise the same constitutional concerns as the detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the plain language of the provision, we find it difficult to believe that the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> could interpret &#167; 1231(a)(6) as containing a reasonableness limitation for aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability but not for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility. Section 1231(a)(6) itself does not draw any distinction between the categories of removable aliens; nor would there be any statutory reason to interpret \"detained beyond the removal period\" differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. <i>See Brown v.

Furthermore, in stating that the statute does not permit indefinite detention, the Court referred generally to aliens as opposed to aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability: \"[i]n our view, the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits <i>an alien's</i> post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about <i>that alien's</i> removal from the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In a case addressing a remarkably similar issue of statutory construction, the Third Circuit recently stated that \"[i]t simply cannot be that the meaning will change depending on the background or pedigree of the petitioner. Were we to so hold, we would render the meaning of any statute as changeable as the currents of the sea, and potentially as cruel and capricious.\" <i>Chmakov v.

We fully agree with this reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Chmakov,</i> the court addressed the applicability of the Supreme Court's construction of certain provisions of IIRIRA and AEDPA to individuals who did not raise the same constitutional concerns as the individuals in the case in which the Court construed the statute. The Supreme Court in <i>St. Cyr</i> held that, notwithstanding certain provisions of IIRIRA and AEDPA, aliens who had been ordered deported on the basis of criminal convictions could petition the federal courts for habeas relief from their deportation decisions. <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 298-314, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span>. The Court in <i>St. Cyr</i> interpreted IIRIRA and AEDPA not to preclude federal habeas jurisdiction both because such preclusion raised serious constitutional concerns under the Suspension Clause and because there was no clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent to preclude habeas. In <i>Chmakov,</i> the government argued that although the <i>St. Cyr</i> Court had interpreted IIRIRA and AEDPA not to repeal federal habeas jurisdiction over <i>criminal</i> deportees, the Court's interpretation of those statutes did not apply to the Chmakovs because, as <i>non-criminal</i> deportees, the Suspension Clause could not be a cause for constitutional concern. <i>Chmakov,</i> 266 F.3d at 215. The Third Circuit responded to this argument by first stating that \"[t]hat argument borders on the nonsensical,\" and the court then held that \"Congress has preserved the right to habeas review for both criminal and noncriminal aliens.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that <i>Zadvydas</i> Court did not actually distinguish between aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability in its analysis of the constitutional concerns raised by the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. The Court only refers to \"admission\" at the outset of the opinion; in its discussion of the constitutional concern raised by the statute, the Court distinguishes between aliens who have \"entered\" the United States and those who have not. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 682, 692, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. As we explained above, <i>see supra</i> note 1, \"admission\" is a defining principle in IIRIRA, whereas \"entry\" was a defining principle in pre-IIRIRA immigration law. In its briefs in the instant appeal, as in <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> the government implies that \"the central operating terms of the two statutes are functionally the same &#8212; namely ... that `entry' and `admission' are interchangeable and that `excludable' and inadmissible' are interchangeable.\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 838. As we also explained above in note 1, however, these terms are <i>not</i> interchangeable. <i>See also id.</i> Admission is defined as \"the <i>lawful</i> entry of [an] alien into the United States,\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(A) (2000) (emphasis added); aliens who enter this country illegally and who were formerly classified as \"deportable\" are now classified as \"inadmissible.\" Therefore, to the extent that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court distinguished between categories of aliens in its analysis of the constitutional concerns raised by the statute, it distinguished only between excludable and deportable aliens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained above that, on the basis of the plain language of the statute, we do not believe that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court could construe the statute differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. It is even less conceivable, therefore, that the Court construed the statute differently for excludable and deportable aliens. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress not only abolished the use of the term \"excludable,\" but it also abolished that category of alien. \"The INA is no longer denominated in terms of `entry' and `exclusion.' IIRIRA replaced these terms with the broader concept of `admission.'\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 838; <i>see also id.</i> (\"We simply cannot ignore that `excludable' is no longer a term that has any statutory import under the INA.\"). To accept the government's argument that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court's construction of &#167; 1231(a)(6) does not apply to Rosales and Carballo, therefore, we would have to conclude that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court interpreted a statute currently in force to apply differently to a category of alien that no longer exists in immigration law. Without explicit instruction by the Court, we will not reach such a conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the court in <i>Lin Guo Xi</i> concluded, \"[t]he clear text of the statute, coupled with the Supreme Court's categorical interpretation, leaves us little choice but to conclude that <i>Zadvydas</i> applies to inadmissible individuals like Lin Guo Xi. The statute, on its face, makes no exceptions for inadmissible aliens. The Supreme Court's unqualified holding provides that the statute `does not permit indefinite detention.'\" <i>Lin Guo Xi,</i> 298 F.3d at 836 (quoting <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Zadvydas,</i> the Court determined that the detention of removable aliens by the INS is \"civil, not criminal, and we assume that [it is] nonpunitive in purpose and effect.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court then looked to the regulatory goals of the statute to determine whether they constituted sufficient \"special justification\" to outweigh the aliens' interest in avoiding detention. According to the government's brief in <i>Zadvydas,</i> the regulatory goals of IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision are \"`ensuring the appearance of aliens at future immigration proceedings' and `[p]reventing danger to the community.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 24).

An excludable alien who cannot be removed to his country of origin presents no greater risk of flight than the aliens who could not be removed to their countries of origin in <i>Zadvydas,</i> nor does an excludable alien's status relate any more to his dangerousness than the removable status of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas</i> related to their dangerousness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> However, the government contends that because Rosales and Carballo are excludable aliens, their detention should not be subject to the same analysis as the detention of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas.</i> According to the government, because excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States, the INS must be permitted to detain them indefinitely if they cannot be removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to enter or be admitted to the United States; indeed, no alien has a constitutional right to enter or be admitted to the United States. We also recognize that the INS is faced with an extremely difficult situation in the case of aliens who legally <i>cannot</i> enter or be admitted to the United States, yet who, by virtue of the fact that their country of origin will not repatriate them, are <i>in</i> the United States. However, the Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> confronted much the same situation. Aliens who are removed on grounds of deportability do not have a constitutional right to stay in the United States, and, as the Court recognized, Congress has plenary power to create immigration law. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 695-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like the Supreme Court, we do not question \"the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject them to supervision with conditions when released from detention, or to incarcerate them where appropriate for violations of those conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Rather, the issue we address is whether aliens that the Government finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned to an indefinite term of imprisonment within the United States.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> concluded that \"for the reasons we have set forth, we believe that an alien's liberty interest is, at the least, strong enough to raise a serious question as to whether, irrespective of the procedures used, the Constitution permits detention that is indefinite and potentially permanent.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to Rosales and Carballo, as we believe that it must, we do not see how we could conclude that the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of Rosales and Carballo raises any less serious constitutional concerns than the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of the aliens in <i>Zadvydas.</i> We emphasize that we understand that this situation, involving criminal aliens whose removal cannot be effected, is a difficult one: we, too, find it unpalatable that inadmissible aliens who have previously abused the privilege of immigration parole should be permitted additional opportunities to live in this country simply because their country of origin will not have them back. As the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court explained, though, \"[t]he choice ... is not between imprisonment and the alien `living at large.' It is between imprisonment and supervision under release conditions that may not be violated.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> Moreover, we find it not only unpalatable but also untenable to conclude that under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment persons living in the United States &#8212; whether by our choice or not &#8212; could be subjected to a life sentence in prison simply because their country of origin will not have them back. A life sentence in prison, in fact, seems to us no less impermissible than the government's torture or summary execution of these aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also argues that in <i>Mezei,</i> the Supreme Court held that the indefinite detention of an excludable alien was permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the government further argues that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court reaffirmed <i>Mezei.</i> We note at the outset that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court explicitly refused to address the continuing validity of <i>Mezei:</i> \"we need not consider the aliens' claim that subsequent developments have undermined <i>Mezei's</i> legal authority.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. Inasmuch as the Court in <i>Mezei</i> permitted the potentially indefinite detention of an excludable alien, however, we agree with the government that we must address <i>Mezei's</i> ramifications for Rosales and Carballo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> We believe that <i>Mezei</i> does not govern the outcome of the instant cases for two reasons. First, the <i>Mezei</i> Court explicitly grounded its decision in the special circumstances of a national emergency and the determination by the Attorney General that Mezei presented a threat to national security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> The Court, in fact, located the Attorney General's authority to exclude and detain Mezei in the Passport Act of 1918. <i>Mezei,</i> 345 U.S. at 210-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105103\"><a href=\"/opinion/105103/shaughnessy-v-united-states-ex-rel-mezei/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span> (\"Congress expressly authorized the President to impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or leaving the United States during periods of international tension and strife. That authorization, originally enacted in the Passport Act of 1918, continues in effect during the present emergency.\"). Moreover, in regard to the proposition that Mezei be released on immigration parole, the Court stated: \"An exclusion proceeding <i>grounded on danger to the national security ...</i> presents different considerations; neither the rationale nor the statutory authority for such release exists.\" <i>Id.</i> at 216, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105103\"><a href=\"/opinion/105103/shaughnessy-v-united-states-ex-rel-mezei/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>. Particularly in a post-September 11 world, we recognize that in special circumstances prolonged post-removal-period detention may be warranted. <i>See Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All of the cases that the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court relied on in assessing the constitutional due process concerns implicated by the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability were decided after <i>Mezei.

In these cases, the contours of constitutionally permissible civil detention are rigorously delineated &#8212; a substantial jurisprudential development from the time that <i>Mezei</i> was decided. As we explained above, the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court held on the basis of these cases that civil detention is constitutionally permissible only \"in certain special and narrow nonpunitive circumstances where a special justification... outweighs the individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.\" <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As we also explained above, we do not believe that any such special circumstances outweigh Rosales's and Carballo's interest in avoiding indefinite and potentially permanent INS detention. Although we must &#8212; as a lower federal court &#8212; apply all pertinent Supreme Court precedent, it is not our role to reconcile cases whose application leads to opposite conclusions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> Therefore, to the extent that we could conclude, in reliance on the Court's holding in <i>Mezei,</i> that the indefinite detention of excludable aliens is constitutionally permissible, we believe such a conclusion to be fatally undermined by the Court's later decisions in the <i>Salerno</i> line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Therefore, prior to construing &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) to contain a reasonable time limitation, the <i>Zadvydas</i> Court addressed whether Congress had clearly indicated an intent in the statute to authorize indefinite post-removal-period detention of aliens whose removal cannot be effected. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 696-99, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. After reviewing the history of the statute, the Court concluded that \"[w]e have found nothing in the history of these statutes that clearly demonstrates a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention. Consequently, interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutional threat, we conclude that, once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 699, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the government presented evidence of our continuing negotiations with Cuba over the return of Cuban nationals excluded from the United States, neither Rosales nor Carballo is currently on a list of persons to be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under either the Supreme Court's construction in <i>Zadvydas</i> or our construction in regard to excludable aliens, we read 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(6) (2000) to contain an implicit reasonable time limitation. Because there is no significant likelihood that Rosales and Carballo will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future and because the INS has detained them longer than six months, we conclude that the INS's detention of Rosales and Carballo is no longer reasonable and is therefore not authorized by IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision. We REVERSE the district courts' denials of Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions, and we REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\") substantially altered the landscape in immigration law. \"Among the changes brought by the IIRIRA was a shift in basic immigration terminology.\"<i>Chi Thon Ngo v.

We, however, do not believe that <i>Chevron</i> applies in this context. First, the government has only advocated in litigation the application of pre-IIRIRA law to petitioners like Rosales and Carballo. An interpretation contained in a brief &#8212; like interpretations contained in opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines &#8212; lacks the force of law and is therefore not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See Christensen v.

I therefore respectfully dissent. The court first finds that Congress, in the course of enacting a statute that virtually all concede was designed to tighten immigration procedures, instead amended the statute in such a way as to obliterate a longstanding distinction that recognized the lessened constitutional protection of persons who had been affirmatively denied entry into the United States, detained at the border, and physically allowed inside the country only as a matter of legislative grace. Instead, the court finds that Congress deliberately accorded such persons the same status as long-time permanent residents. Second, and perhaps even more disturbing, the court essentially accords such persons <i>all</i> of the due process rights of American citizens. The court therefore makes it impossible, in our circuit at least, for the United States government to detain for more than six months any number of aliens who present themselves at our border and are denied entry, or are paroled into the United States only conditionally. It further extends this status regardless of whatever criminal acts those persons may have committed. I believe that this result cannot be derived from the text of the Constitution and is contrary to existing Supreme Court precedent, which the Supreme Court has recently explicitly relied on and refused to overrule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with the broader holding, the court finds that full due process applies to all persons at or within the borders of the United States, and that such due process is not merely procedural, but essentially accords any such person a right to remain at liberty in the United States comparable to that accorded to United States citizens. It does this by commencing with the unremarkable proposition that the government may not wantonly execute or torture a person, and then extrapolates that the government is disabled from applying its immigration and criminal laws to such excludable aliens in ways that are different from those that apply to deportable aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding has nothing to do with what we would generally classify as \"process.\" Rosales and Carballo have had that, in abundance. They have been able to argue, before independent arbiters, that they are not the persons to whom the law is intended to apply, that they do not come within the reach of the law, and any other procedural issues they may wish to raise. They have had this review before the various levels of the administrative bureaucracy prescribed by Congress and before the courts of the United States. It cannot be disputed that Rosales and Garcia are both \"excludable\" aliens in that they sought admission to the United States, were detained at the border before entering the United States, and were paroled into the United States only as a matter of grace and on the condition that their parole may be revoked at any time, and especially for the commission of criminal offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the many agencies and courts to have considered their cases have ruled that they come within the mandate of Congress that persons who are \"excludable\" and have committed crimes of sufficient seriousness should be removed from the United States and, if not immediately deportable, be detained at the discretion of the Attorney General. There is little doubt that Carballo and Rosales fit in this category of excludable aliens who have committed serious offenses. Simply to detail the crimes of which they have been convicted, and others of which they have been arrested, makes this abundantly clear. The highlights of Rosales's criminal career include arrests for aggravated battery, possession of marijuana, burglary and loitering and convictions for possession of marijuana, resisting arrest, grand theft, burglary, grand larceny, escape from a penal institution, and conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine. Op. at 392. Carballo, no less prolific, has been arrested for aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny, battery, carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm, trespass, and possession of marijuana. He has been convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery. Op. at 393. If this law cannot be applied to these persons, it seems clear that no alien, no matter his degree of criminality, can be subject to this law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court provides a number of soothing statements as to how certain actions against such aliens might be permissible, but it provides no principled reasons for such distinctions, nor a square holding that in fact they can be implemented. May parole conditions for excludable alien criminals be more onerous than for citizens? It implies that they may be, by referring to parole conditions and practices applied to Rosales that are not (and constitutionally may not be) applied to criminals on parole. Op. at 395 &amp; nn. 7-8. However, the opinion provides no basis for such a distinction. May Congress prescribe indefinite detention as a punishment for any violation of such conditions when similar punishment does not apply to citizen parole-violators? No answer is given. A careful reading of the court's logic and rhetoric would indicate that the very same type of attack that is mounted against the congressional mandate here would be found congenial by this court when mounted against any such distinction. Would any more draconian punishment, such as that suggested above, or an enactment that excludable aliens could be detained indefinitely as punishment for any criminal infraction, pass the muster of this court, under its broad rubric of due process, or under its application of the Eighth Amendment? In oral argument, it was indicated that any violation of parole, under current law, was punishable by at most one year's additional detention. Would it violate the Ex Post Facto Clause for any alien already excluded from this country to have applied to him indefinite detention? Again, no logic is given that would answer the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's approach leads to a host of practical problems, both at the level of this circuit and of the nation. As the court indicates, we have jurisdiction only because the INS happened to choose to detain these aliens within the boundaries of this circuit, at FCI Memphis and at Lexington. Op. at 392, 394. Since our holding is generally at odds with those of most other circuits, and explicitly at odds with four other circuits, it may well be that the INS will simply choose to remove from the Sixth Circuit all those aliens to whom this dictate would apply. <i>Carrera-Valdez v.

He had been a longtime resident of the United States, and had always been law abiding during that time. He simply went abroad for a period of 19 months, and was detained at the border when he returned.

No matter how much the court may disagree with the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens, it simply cannot be disputed that the controlling Supreme Court precedent makes that distinction and holds that excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right to be permitted to remain in the United States at liberty if their removal cannot be seasonably obtained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding, applying as it does to persons with very extensive criminal records, would obviously apply to persons otherwise blameless, who have simply been detained attempting to enter the United States: After a maximum of six months, if such persons can not be sent elsewhere, they would have to be released into the United States, with some possible exception for individualized determinations. Thus, if hundreds, or thousands, or hundreds of thousands of such persons present themselves at our borders, this court holds that the government of the United States is constitutionally disabled from doing anything, after a short interval, other than set all such persons at liberty in our country. While this result could be good policy, it seems inconceivable that such a disabling of congressional policy choices is consistent with a fair reading of the Immigration and Naturalization Clause of the Constitution, <i>see, e.g., Galvan v. Press,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105227\"><a href=\"/opinion/105227/galvan-v-press/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 531, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105227\"><a href=\"/opinion/105227/galvan-v-press/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The process that is due to persons to whom the government has explicitly denied entry into the country is quite different from what is due to others, as a matter of constitutional law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the statutory argument, the court essentially makes two points. The first is that since the language of IIRIRA uses the term \"inadmissible,\" it has, therefore, abolished the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens, for all purposes. Op. at 407-408. The court also remarkably concludes, by holding that the statute does not permit indefinite detention for excludable aliens as well, that Congress abolished the distinction with the result of giving excludable aliens the same rights as deportable aliens. Of course, Congress had quite the contrary intention: it sought to tighten immigration regulations. As Congress itself provided in the text of the statute, courts were not to construe IIRIRA to \"create any procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(h). The intent of Congress is clear that it had intended, by using the language of \"inadmissibility,\" to subject deportable aliens to the same potential for indefinite detention, if they could not be removed after the commission of a serious crime, that excludable aliens had been subject to both statutorily and constitutionally for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's development of a \"reasonable time\" limitation for the detention of \"excludable\" aliens is based wholly on the Supreme Court's effective rewriting of the statute <i>for deportable aliens,</i> which is all that the Court had before it in <i>Zadvydas.</i> Applying this reasonable time limitation to excludable aliens misunderstands the Supreme Court's analysis in <i>Zadvydas</i> and, more fundamentally, the canon of constitutional avoidance. The Court in <i>Zadvydas</i> did not hold that the text, or even the legislative history, of the statute indicated Congress's intent to place a reasonable time limitation on the detention of \"deportable\" aliens. 533 U.S. at 697-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. Instead, the Court employed the canon of construction that Congress does not intend for its statutes to raise serious constitutional problems, also known as the canon of constitutional avoidance. <i>Id.</i> at 698, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. Specifically, the Court relied on the statutory text that the Attorney General \"may\" detain individuals after the removal period. <i>Id.</i> at 697, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span>. For the Court, this permissive language did not necessarily confer unfettered discretion on the Attorney General to detain aliens, but must have meant, because of the canon of constitutional avoidance, that the Attorney General should exercise his discretion within constitutional limits. Of course, as demonstrated above, governing Supreme Court precedent, including <i>Zadvydas,</i> clearly indicates that there is no constitutional limit on the detention of excludable aliens. Thus, the Attorney General \"may,\" in his discretion, detain excludable aliens beyond the ninety-day removal period, and the detention need not comply with the reasonable time limitation that cabins his discretion with regard to deportable aliens arising from the canon of constitutional avoidance and nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, its merits aside, the canon of constitutional avoidance has historically contemplated precisely such a result. From the beginnings of statutory construction in federal courts, the Supreme Court has held that \"an Act of Congress ought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible construction remains available.\" <i>See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110040\"><a href=\"/opinion/110040/nlrb-v-catholic-bishop-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 500, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110040\"><a href=\"/opinion/110040/nlrb-v-catholic-bishop-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110040\"><a href=\"/opinion/110040/nlrb-v-catholic-bishop-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span> (1979) (discussing the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in <i>Murray v. The Charming Betsy,</i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"84778\"><a href=\"/opinion/84778/murray-v-schooner-charming-betsy/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span> (1804)). The canon of constitutional avoidance is a majoritarian default rule. That is, the canon draws its legitimacy from the premise that Congress generally does not intend for its statutes to exceed constitutional limits. But this supposition cannot be significantly expanded without straining the justification beyond reason. Congress often intends to legislate <i>to,</i> even if not <i>beyond,</i> the limitations of the Constitution. If the canon of constitutional avoidance is to be justifiable, it must at least permit Congress to legislate to the limits of what is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no textual source for the Supreme Court's application of a specific time limitation to the Attorney General's discretion to detain aliens under IIRIRA. Instead, the word \"may\" on which the Supreme Court focused in <i>Zadvydas,</i> if the canon of constitutional avoidance is to have any meaning, permits the Attorney General to detain beyond the removal period, but only as allowed by the Constitution. And the Supreme Court is clear that the Constitution does not grant \"excludable\" aliens a right to release into the United States after a \"reasonable time.\" Thus, that \"deportable\" aliens may only be detained for a \"reasonable time\" after the removal period but \"excludable\" aliens may be detained indefinitely is not only a consistent, but the required, reading of &#167; 1231(a)(6) in the context of the canon of constitutional avoidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, our court's holding that extends the \"reasonable time\" limitation to excludable aliens is a classic example of the tail wagging the dog. The Supreme Court rewrites a statute with respect to one class of persons, to avoid constitutional doubts, and we are then required to read the statute in the same way in cases where there are no constitutional doubts. This does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I freely grant that there is some anomaly in having the same words mean different things when applied to different groups of people. However, that is a natural consequence of an aggressive application of the constitutional-doubt standard, implemented by a conceded rewriting of the statute, rather than by choosing between plausible alternatives. And, while certainly not conclusive, the fact that the Supreme Court chose to vacate our previous decision in <i>Rosales-Garcia,</i> which followed the same logic as the court displays today, is some indication that that result is not lambently clear to the Supreme Court. <i>Thoms v. Rosales-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He did characterize both alternatives as unsustainable, but the nature of the situation requires us to accept one or the other. <i>Zadvydas,</i> 533 U.S. at 710-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Under these circumstances, I believe it does far less violence to the language of the statute, to congressional intent, and to a proper understanding of the canon of constitutional avoidance to confront the words of the statute and interpret them according to their tenor, in a case where any \"constitutional doubt\" is far less than in <i>Zadvydas,</i> assuming that there is any doubt whatsoever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, today's decision, perhaps out of a misplaced concern for the individuals before us, grossly distorts the meaning of a statute, and greatly diminishes the range of policy choices available to the political branches in a field uniquely committed to their discretion. Whether indefinite detention of persons as incorrigible as Rosales and Carballo is good policy is not for us to decide. It is a matter for Congress, subject at most to a requirement that some procedural fairness be applied under the Due Process Clause, a requirement that has been amply fulfilled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p> One of the most perceptive commentators on<i>Mezei</i> argued eloquently for a more nuanced approach that would elide and break down this rigid distinction, based on a number of interesting factors.

However, at every step of his article he takes it as a given that the distinction still has vitality, for the time being.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
