Some may say that this plan is unwise or that it may not succeed.  It is not for this court to make such a determination.  Unquestionably the design of the plan is to alleviate to some degree the crisis now at hand in Atlanta, and the goal of the plan is to preserve Atlanta's future as a city in which both whites and blacks may live.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, Crow and Susman, and plaintiff-intervenor Ervin Company own tracts of land in an unincorporated area of Fulton County, Georgia.  They propose to build low-rent public housing on their land some distance away from the racially concentrated areas of Fulton County.  They have been frustrated in their efforts by the refusal of Fulton County officials to issue building permits to them, allegedly for racial reasons.  The plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, Carr, and Calhoun, sue on behalf of themselves and all other eligible persons currently on the waiting list of the Atlanta Housing Authority for lowrent public housing.  They allege that they are being denied access to public housing outside of the racially impacted areas of Fulton County because of the actions of the County officials.
