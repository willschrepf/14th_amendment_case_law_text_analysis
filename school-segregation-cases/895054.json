Here, the appellants failed to establish that each of those elements were\npresent for the prescribed 10 years. The trial court did not err in quieting title in\nthe respondents. And because the corporate form does not afford protection from\npersonal liability when an officer commits a tort, the trial court did not err in finding\nthe appellant personally liable for treble damages as a result of her trespass.\nFurther, because the claim of adverse possession was a defense to the trespass\nclaim, there was no need for the trial court to segregate the attorney fees as the\ntwo claims were intertwined. We affirm the trial court.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n       Reginald and Brenda Wren (Wren) and Tammy Blakey and the Flying T\n Ranch, Inc. (collectively, Blakey) own adjacent property in Arlington, Washington.\nWren sued Blakey for trespass and quiet title. Blakey counterclaimed, contending\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/2\n\n\nthat she was entitled to the property by adverse possession.               The trial court\n\nconcluded that Blakey failed to prove the elements of adverse possession and\n\nquieted titled in Wren, awarding him damages and attorney fees under the\n\ntrespass statute. RCW 4.24.630.\n\n         At the time Wren purchased the property, a hedgerow measuring from 50\n\nto 70 feet wide separated the properties.1 Since the 1930s, a fence, hidden by the\n\nhedgerow, marked the boundary of the property.\n\n         Blakey acquired the property from a sheriff's sale in 1989 and took\n\npossession in 1990 after the right of redemption had passed.2 Edwin Tannis\n\nowned the Blakey property previously.3\n\n         Wren acquired the adjacent property in 2004 from Robert and Winnie\n\nRollins (Rollins) through a statutory warranty deed.4 In 1983, Rollins acquired the\n\nproperty from Charles and Glenice Kroeze (Kroeze).5                Kroeze acquired the\n\nproperty from his mother in 1964.6\n\n         Tannis, Kroeze, and Rollins all testified that each farmed the parcel up to\n\nthe edge of the hedgerow with the actual area of cultivation ofeither parcel dictated\n\nby the width of the hedgerow at the time.7 All three testified that the boundary line\n\nwas straight and coincided with the historic fence.8\n\n\n\n\n1 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 62.\n2 RP at 236, 409.\n3 RP at 237.\n4 RP at 56; Exhibit (Ex.) 39; Clerk's Papers at 84, Findings of Fact (FF) 2.\n5 CP    at 84-85, FF 3; Ex. 40.\n6 CP    at 85, FF 4; Ex. 40.\n7 CP    at 88, FF 13 (undisputed).\n8 Ex.   40; RP at 238, 465.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/3\n\n\n       Blakey testified that in 1990 she used a backhoe to clear out some of the\n\nbramble. In so doing, she accidentally pulled out some of the fence.9 She repaired\n\nsome of the posts in the fence line.10 The hedgerow grew back.\n\n       In 2009, Blakey employed Andy Floe to install a fence on the property line.\n\nFloe approached Wren to establish the boundary line because he was having\n\ntrouble locating the property line.11     Wren showed Floe the survey from the\n\nproperty which was done in 2004 when Wren purchased the property. That survey\n\nshowed the boundary line between the properties to be a straight line.12 The\n\nsurvey showed steel T-posts and a few wooden posts every 100 feet along the\n\nproperty line.13 The survey marker had been placed there by Richard Ross, Delta\n\nLand Surveyors, who surveyed the property in 2004 prior to the Wren purchase.14\n\n       A few weeks later, Floe demolished the hedgerow and began installing a\n\nbarbed wire fence in the now denuded area.15 Wren stopped Floe, telling him he\n\nwas in the wrong place.16 Blakey then told Wren that this was where she had\n\ninstalled the 1990 fence and that the property was hers by adverse possession.17\n\nBlakey ordered Floe to continue, telling Wren to sue her.18\n\n\n\n\n9 RP at 423.\n10 RP at 420.\n11 RP at 65.\n12 RP at 65.\n13 RP at 66.\n14 RP at 66-67.\n15 RP at 71\n16 RP at 70-71.\n17 RP at 72; CP at 89, FF 16 (unchallenged).\n18 RP at 72.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/4\n\n\n       After Blakey installed the fence, Wren hired a surveyor, William Lloyd.19\n\nThat survey clearly shows that the fence Blakey installed was located west of the\n\nboundary line between the two properties, ranging from 0.00 feet at the southerly\n\nend to 49.35 feet west of the boundary line at the northerly end.20\n\n       Blakey asserts that the fence was on the western side of her property and\n\nthat the fence she installed in 2009 was the same as the one in 1990.21 However,\n\nthis testimony is contradicted by Kroeze, Rollins, and Tannis, all of whom testified\n\nthat the boundary was a straight line between the properties.22\n\n       Wren also presented evidence from Terry Curtis, a photogrammetry\n\nexpert.23   Curtis's stereoscopic aerial photographs supported the witnesses'\n\ntestimony that the boundary between the two properties was a straight line.24\n\n       Blakey, in addition to her own testimony, presented testimony from Gerald\n\nPainter, a professional land surveyor who was currently the owner of a flying\n\nschool where Blakey kept her plane.25 However, Painter did not look at the\n\nproperty or conduct a survey himself.26\n\n       The court found that the property line was clearly established and further\n\nthat Blakey had failed to establish adverse possession.27 The court found that the\n\nhedgerow had grown back since 1990 so there was no established use of the\n\n\n\n\n19 RP at 133-34.\n20 Ex. 6.\n21 RP at 429, 435.\n22 RP at 238, 465\n23 RP at 153-54.\n24 RP at 160, 174.\n25 RP at 334.\n26 RP at 340, 383.\n27 CP at 8 (Memorandum Decision, p. 3).\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/5\n\n\nproperty and thus the installation of the barbed wire fence in 2009 was a\n\ntrespass.28\n\n         The court awarded damages for the cost of additional feed Wren had to\n\npurchase because the barbed wire fence prevented Wren from pasturing his\n\nhorses.29 The court also included costs for the installation of a wooden fence to\n\nreplace the barbed wire fence. The court trebled damages under RCW 4.24.630,\n\nthe intentional trespass statute.30 Treble damages amounted to $40,398.75.31\n\nThe court also awarded costs and attorney fees.\n\n         Blakey appeals, arguing the court erred in quieting title in Wren and\n\ndismissing her claim for adverse possession and awarding attorney fees. Blakey\n\nalso appeals the court's attorney fee award.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\nAdverse Possession\n\n         Blakey challenges the trial court's findings that her activities on the disputed\n\nland did not constitute adverse possession because they were neither open and\n\nnotorious nor hostile.\n\n         Adverse possession presents questions of both law and fact. The trier of\n\nfact determines whether the essential facts exist, and the court determines whether\n\nthose facts constitute adverse possession. Anderson v. Hudak. 80 Wn. App. 398,\n\n401-02, 907 P.2d 305 (1995). On appeal, this court reviews the determination of\n\n\n\n28 CP   at 9 (Memorandum Decision, p. 4).\n29 CP   at 11 (Memorandum Decision, p. 6).\n30 CP   at 9 (Memorandum Decision, p. 4).\n31 CP   at 12 (Memorandum Decision, p. 7).\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/6\n\n\nadverse possession de novo but defers to the factual findings made at trial. Bryant\n\nv. Palmer Coking Coal Co.. 86 Wn. App. 204, 210, 936 P.2d 1163 (1997).\n\n      When the trial court enters findings of fact and conclusions of law, our\n\nreview is limited to determining whether those findings of fact are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence and if the findings of fact support the conclusions of law.\n\nDouglas v. Visser. 173 Wn. App. 823, 829, 295 P.3d 800 (2013). Substantial\n\nevidence is evidence sufficient to persuade a fair-minded, rational person of the\n\ntruth of the declared premises.    Douglas, 173 Wn. App. at 829. We view the\n\nevidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prevailing\n\nparty. Top Line Builders, Inc. v. Bovenkamp, 179 Wn. App. 794, 803, 320 P.3d\n\n130 (2014) (citing Jensen v. Lake Jane Estates, 165 Wn. App. 100, 104, 267 P.3d\n\n435(2011)).\n\n      To successfully establish an adverse possession claim, a claimant must\n\npossess the property for at least 10 years in a manner that is \"'(1) open and\n\nnotorious, (2) actual and uninterrupted, (3) exclusive, and (4) hostile.'\" Gorman v.\n\nCity of Woodinville. 175 Wn.2d 68, 71, 283 P.3d 1082 (2012) (quoting ITT\n\nRavonier. Inc. v. Bell, 112 Wn.2d 754, 757, 774 P.2d 6 (1989)).          Title vests\n\nautomatically in a claimant who satisfies all of these elements throughout the 10-\n\nyear period. Gorman, 175 Wn.2d at 72. The burden of establishing each element\n\nis on the party claiming to have adversely possessed the property. Anderson, 80\n\nWn. App. at 401.\n\n      Adverse possession occurs if a party uses property \"'as if it were his own,\n\nentirely disregards the claims of others, asks permission from nobody, and uses\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/7\n\n\nthe property under a claim of right.'\" Standing Rock Homeowners Ass'n v. Misich,\n\n106 Wn. App. 231, 239, 23 P.3d 520 (2001) (quoting Granite Beach Holdings. LLC\n\nv. Dep't of Natural Res.. 103 Wn. App. 186, 200, 11 P.3d 847 (2000)). If the land\n\nat issue is vacant, open, unenclosed, and unimproved, we presume that the use\n\nis permissive. Standing Rock Homeowners Ass'n. 106 Wn. App. at 239. The\n\nultimate test is whether the adverse possessor exercised such dominion over the\n\nland that the legal owner should have recognized that the adverse possessor was\n\ntreating the land as would its true owner. ITT Rayonier, Inc., 112 Wn.2d at 759.\n\n       Wren introduced a survey from Cascade Surveying & Engineering, Inc.,\n\nwhich clearly shows that the fence installed by Blakey veered off the straight\n\nproperty line.32 Wren also submitted multiple aerial photographs attested to by\n\nTerry Curtis, a photogrammetry expert. Curtis supplied the court with photographs\n\ntaken from 1976 through 2009. Curtis presented a 1983 photograph in which the\n\nfence posts were stereoscopically discernible. From that information, he drew a\n\nline through the fence posts supporting the previous owners' testimony that the\n\nhistoric fence line was a straight line.33\n\n        Rollins testified that he had rented a portion of the Blakey property to\n\nprovide feed for his cows.34 Aerial photographs showed the hedgerow to be a\n\nconsistent straight line on the Wren side, while the hedgerow on the Blakey\n\nproperty continued to expand eastward into that property.35\n\n\n\n\n32 Ex. 6; RP at 143.\n33 Ex. 28; RP at 160.\n34 RP at 93.\n35 Ex. 13, 14, 17.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/8\n\n\n       Blakey claims that her repairing the fence in 1990 is sufficient to satisfy the\n\nelements needed to establish adverse possession. This claim, however, is only\n\nsupported by her own testimony and Gerald Painter, a surveyor, who neither\n\nsurveyed nor visited the property.36\n\n       Blakey provided a declaration of Robert Huey, a surveyor, who surveyed\n\nthe property on April 11, 2013, two months after trial,37 in her motion for\n\nreconsideration and in her brief. This survey was not before the trial court and\n\nWren objected to its admission under CR 59(a)(4).38\n\n       CR 59(a)(4) provides that a new trial may be granted for evidence that the\n\nparty \"could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at trial.\"\n\nSee also Morinaga v. Vue. 85 Wn. App. 822, 831, 35 P.2d 637 (1997) (only newly\n\ndiscovered    evidence      not   available   may     be   considered   on   motion   for\n\nreconsideration). Blakey argues that such evidence was admissible under CR\n\n59(g) permitting the court to open the judgment, if entered, and take additional\n\ntestimony. Blakey cites Ghaffari v. Dep't of Licensing. 62 Wn. App. 870, 875-76,\n\n816 P.2d 66 (1991) (it is within court's discretion to consider additional evidence\n\nat motion for new trial in an action tried without a jury). But, Blakey does not offer\n\nany reason as to why this evidence could not have been presented at trial.\n\n       The trial court does not indicate which evidence it considered other than the\n\nbriefs of both parties in its order denying the motion for reconsideration. This court\n\nhas no way to know whether the court abused its discretion if it admitted the\n\n\n\n36 RP at 340, 383.\n37 CP at 27; Appellant's Br. at 19; Appellant's Reply Br. at 10, n.7.\n38 CP at 34; Resp't's Br. at 23-25.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/9\n\n\n\nevidence, particularly here, where the evidence could easily have been presented\n\nat trial. However, even the \"corrected\" survey line in the Huey declaration shows\n\nthat the boundary line was straight and not curved.39\n\n       Here, there was substantial evidence that the property owners, present and\n\nformer, used the land only up to the hedgerow. Blakey does not challenge finding\n\nof fact 12 describing the hedgerow as 12 feet high and 70 feet wide.40 A\n\nphotograph exhibit showed the fence line visible in 1983.41 Thus, it is clear that\n\nBlakey could not have exerted the requisite dominion and control required to\n\nestablish adverse possession.\n\n       In conclusion, substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings of fact,\n\nwhich support its conclusions of law.\n\nPersonal Liability\n\n       Blakey contends that the trial court erred in finding her personally liable,\n\njointly and severally with Flying T Ranch, for the damages sustained by Blakey's\n\ntrespass upon the Wren property. Blakey is the sole shareholder and president of\n\nFlying T Ranch corporation.42\n\n       The corporate form protects officersfrom personal liability unless the officer\n\ncommits a tort or disregards the corporate entity. See Grayson v. Nordic Const-\n\nCo., Inc., 92 Wn.2d 548, 552-53, 599 P.2d 1271 (1979); Johnson v. Harrigan-\n\nPeach Land Dev. Co., 79 Wn.2d 745, 752-53, 489 P.2d 923 (1971).

Co., 188\n\nWash. 340, 343, 62 P.2d 708 (1936), where the court held a corporate officer liable\n\nfor his active participation in conversion. 188 Wash, at 342-43. In determining\n\npersonal liability, the court stated that \"[t]he liability of an officer of a corporation\n\nfor his own tort committed within the scope of his official duties is the same as the\n\nliability for tort of any other agent or servant.\" Dodson. 188 Wash, at 343. \"Where\n\nthe officer performs an act or a series of acts which would amount to conversion if\n\nhe acted for himself alone, he is personally liable even though the acts were\n\nperformed for the benefit of his principal and without profit to himself personally.\"\n\nDodson, 188 Wash at 343.\n\n       Dodson has been cited favorably in several subsequent cases. Harrigan-\n\nPeach. 79 Wn.2d at 753 (officers liable where they participated in fraudulent acts\n\nand maintained close control); State v. Ralph Williams' NW Chrysler Plymouth.\n\nInc., 87 Wn.2d 298, 322, 553 P.2d 423 (1976) (officer personally responsible for\n\nmany of the company's unlawful acts that violated the Consumer Protection Act\n\n(CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW); Grayson. 92 Wn.2d 548, 551, 554, 599 P.2d 1271\n\n(1979) (officer who drafted and directed the mailing of brochure containing\n\ndeceptive advertising in violation of the CPA held liable).\n\n       Blakey contends that Dodson and its progeny do not apply here because\n\nthe \"Wrens never alleged that Blakey actively participated in tortiousconversion.\"43\n\nThis argument is not persuasive. When Wren approached Floe to inform him that\n\nhe was putting the fence in the wrong area, Blakey came and asserted that she\n\n\n\n43 Appellant's Reply Br. at 20.\n\n\n                                           10\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/11\n\n\nhad acquired the property by adverse possession.44 Because the trial court found\n\nno adverse possession, Blakey's incursion onto the land amounted to a trespass\n\nin violation of the statute, RCW 4.24.630. The statute provides that a person acts\n\n\"'wrongfully if the person intentionally and unreasonably commits the act or acts\n\nwhile knowing, or having reason to know, that he or she lacks authorization to so\n\nact.'\" The trial court found that Blakey's statement that she owned the property by\n\nadverse possession in effect acknowledged that she did not have rightful\n\npossession to the property and thus her occupation of that land was intentional.45\n\nAttorney Fees\n\n       In addition to providing an award of treble damages for intentional trespass,\n\nRCW 4.24.630 provides for the award of attorney fees. Wren submitted a detailed\n\naffidavit, including the hours billed and the type of work performed. The court\n\nreviewed these records and made an adjustment.\n\n       Blakey argues the trial court abused its discretion by not segregating\n\nattorney fees. Blakey contends that Wren was entitled to fees only for that portion\n\nof his claim that pertained to intentional trespass and not those used to defeat the\n\nadverse possession claim. Blakey argues that Wren's claims did not involve the\n\nsame core facts or related legal theories. But it is clear that the trespass occurred\n\nbecause of Blakey's illegal assertion of adverse possession. It was that trespass\n\nthat caused Wren to bring an action to quiet title and seek damages for trespass.46\n\n\n\n\n44 CP at 89, FF 16 (unchallenged).\n45 CP at 10 (Memorandum Decision, p. 5).\n46 Blakey asserts the timber trespass claim as an unsuccessful claim. However, before\ntrial, Wren withdrew that claim as a basis for its action.\n\n\n                                              11\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/12\n\n\n       A trial court is not required to segregate fees where it determines that the\n\nvarious claims are intertwined and no reasonable segregation of claims can be\n\nmade. Boguch v. Landover Corp., 153 Wn. App. 595, 620, 224 P.3d 795 (2009).\n\nWhere \"the trial court finds the claims to be so related that no reasonable\n\nsegregation of successful and unsuccessful claims can be made, there need be\n\nno segregation of attorney fees.\"47 Nor is fee segregation required \"where the\n\nclaims all relate to the same fact pattern, but allege different bases for recovery.\n\nEthridge v. Hwang. 105 Wn. App. 447, 461, 20 P.3d 958 (2001).\n\n       In Henslev v. Eckerhart. 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40\n\n(1983), the plaintiffs brought a civil rights claim, raising six different conditions at a\n\nstate hospital that they alleged violated their constitutional right to treatment. The\n\ntrial court found five of the six conditions violated the plaintiffs' rights and awarded\n\nthem attorney fees based on their total submitted hours even though one of the\n\nclaims was unsuccessful.48         Although the statute authorized fees only on\n\nsuccessful claims, the United States Supreme Court held that some\n\n       claims for relief will involve a common core of facts or will be based\n       on related legal theories. Much of counsel's time will be devoted\n       generally to the litigations as a whole, making it difficult to divide the\n       hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis.

In upholding the fee award, our Supreme\n\nCourt held that reducing a fee by a percentage is permissible where, as there, the\n\nparticular facts of the case make the segregation of actual hours difficult. Clausen,\n\n174Wn.2dat82.\n\n        When Wren filed the action for trespass, Blakey countered that there was\n\nno trespass because of adverse possession. Because the costs of the litigation\n\nall stemmed from Blakey's claim of adverse possession, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in not segregating the fees.\n\n        Below, Blakey did not dispute the reasonableness of the amount of the fees\n\nawarded, only that the trial court failed to segregate those fees. Because we have\n\ndetermined that no segregation was necessary, we affirm the trial court's award of\n\nfees.\n\n        Wren requests an award of attorney fees on appeal based on RCW\n\n4.24.630 and RAP 18.1. \"A party may recover attorney fees and costs on appeal\n\n\n49174Wn.2dat81.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/14\n\n\nwhen granted by applicable law.\" Oregon Mut.

Here, the appellants failed to establish that each of those elements were\npresent for the prescribed 10 years. The trial court did not err in quieting title in\nthe respondents. And because the corporate form does not afford protection from\npersonal liability when an officer commits a tort, the trial court did not err in finding\nthe appellant personally liable for treble damages as a result of her trespass.\nFurther, because the claim of adverse possession was a defense to the trespass\nclaim, there was no need for the trial court to segregate the attorney fees as the\ntwo claims were intertwined. We affirm the trial court.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n       Reginald and Brenda Wren (Wren) and Tammy Blakey and the Flying T\n Ranch, Inc. (collectively, Blakey) own adjacent property in Arlington, Washington.\nWren sued Blakey for trespass and quiet title. Blakey counterclaimed, contending\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/2\n\n\nthat she was entitled to the property by adverse possession.               The trial court\n\nconcluded that Blakey failed to prove the elements of adverse possession and\n\nquieted titled in Wren, awarding him damages and attorney fees under the\n\ntrespass statute. RCW 4.24.630.\n\n         At the time Wren purchased the property, a hedgerow measuring from 50\n\nto 70 feet wide separated the properties.1 Since the 1930s, a fence, hidden by the\n\nhedgerow, marked the boundary of the property.\n\n         Blakey acquired the property from a sheriff's sale in 1989 and took\n\npossession in 1990 after the right of redemption had passed.2 Edwin Tannis\n\nowned the Blakey property previously.3\n\n         Wren acquired the adjacent property in 2004 from Robert and Winnie\n\nRollins (Rollins) through a statutory warranty deed.4 In 1983, Rollins acquired the\n\nproperty from Charles and Glenice Kroeze (Kroeze).5                Kroeze acquired the\n\nproperty from his mother in 1964.6\n\n         Tannis, Kroeze, and Rollins all testified that each farmed the parcel up to\n\nthe edge of the hedgerow with the actual area of cultivation ofeither parcel dictated\n\nby the width of the hedgerow at the time.7 All three testified that the boundary line\n\nwas straight and coincided with the historic fence.8\n\n\n\n\n1 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 62.\n2 RP at 236, 409.\n3 RP at 237.\n4 RP at 56; Exhibit (Ex.) 39; Clerk's Papers at 84, Findings of Fact (FF) 2.\n5 CP    at 84-85, FF 3; Ex. 40.\n6 CP    at 85, FF 4; Ex. 40.\n7 CP    at 88, FF 13 (undisputed).\n8 Ex.   40; RP at 238, 465.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/3\n\n\n       Blakey testified that in 1990 she used a backhoe to clear out some of the\n\nbramble. In so doing, she accidentally pulled out some of the fence.9 She repaired\n\nsome of the posts in the fence line.10 The hedgerow grew back.\n\n       In 2009, Blakey employed Andy Floe to install a fence on the property line.\n\nFloe approached Wren to establish the boundary line because he was having\n\ntrouble locating the property line.11     Wren showed Floe the survey from the\n\nproperty which was done in 2004 when Wren purchased the property. That survey\n\nshowed the boundary line between the properties to be a straight line.12 The\n\nsurvey showed steel T-posts and a few wooden posts every 100 feet along the\n\nproperty line.13 The survey marker had been placed there by Richard Ross, Delta\n\nLand Surveyors, who surveyed the property in 2004 prior to the Wren purchase.14\n\n       A few weeks later, Floe demolished the hedgerow and began installing a\n\nbarbed wire fence in the now denuded area.15 Wren stopped Floe, telling him he\n\nwas in the wrong place.16 Blakey then told Wren that this was where she had\n\ninstalled the 1990 fence and that the property was hers by adverse possession.17\n\nBlakey ordered Floe to continue, telling Wren to sue her.18\n\n\n\n\n9 RP at 423.\n10 RP at 420.\n11 RP at 65.\n12 RP at 65.\n13 RP at 66.\n14 RP at 66-67.\n15 RP at 71\n16 RP at 70-71.\n17 RP at 72; CP at 89, FF 16 (unchallenged).\n18 RP at 72.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/4\n\n\n       After Blakey installed the fence, Wren hired a surveyor, William Lloyd.19\n\nThat survey clearly shows that the fence Blakey installed was located west of the\n\nboundary line between the two properties, ranging from 0.00 feet at the southerly\n\nend to 49.35 feet west of the boundary line at the northerly end.20\n\n       Blakey asserts that the fence was on the western side of her property and\n\nthat the fence she installed in 2009 was the same as the one in 1990.21 However,\n\nthis testimony is contradicted by Kroeze, Rollins, and Tannis, all of whom testified\n\nthat the boundary was a straight line between the properties.22\n\n       Wren also presented evidence from Terry Curtis, a photogrammetry\n\nexpert.23   Curtis's stereoscopic aerial photographs supported the witnesses'\n\ntestimony that the boundary between the two properties was a straight line.24\n\n       Blakey, in addition to her own testimony, presented testimony from Gerald\n\nPainter, a professional land surveyor who was currently the owner of a flying\n\nschool where Blakey kept her plane.25 However, Painter did not look at the\n\nproperty or conduct a survey himself.26\n\n       The court found that the property line was clearly established and further\n\nthat Blakey had failed to establish adverse possession.27 The court found that the\n\nhedgerow had grown back since 1990 so there was no established use of the\n\n\n\n\n19 RP at 133-34.\n20 Ex. 6.\n21 RP at 429, 435.\n22 RP at 238, 465\n23 RP at 153-54.\n24 RP at 160, 174.\n25 RP at 334.\n26 RP at 340, 383.\n27 CP at 8 (Memorandum Decision, p. 3).\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/5\n\n\nproperty and thus the installation of the barbed wire fence in 2009 was a\n\ntrespass.28\n\n         The court awarded damages for the cost of additional feed Wren had to\n\npurchase because the barbed wire fence prevented Wren from pasturing his\n\nhorses.29 The court also included costs for the installation of a wooden fence to\n\nreplace the barbed wire fence. The court trebled damages under RCW 4.24.630,\n\nthe intentional trespass statute.30 Treble damages amounted to $40,398.75.31\n\nThe court also awarded costs and attorney fees.\n\n         Blakey appeals, arguing the court erred in quieting title in Wren and\n\ndismissing her claim for adverse possession and awarding attorney fees. Blakey\n\nalso appeals the court's attorney fee award.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\nAdverse Possession\n\n         Blakey challenges the trial court's findings that her activities on the disputed\n\nland did not constitute adverse possession because they were neither open and\n\nnotorious nor hostile.\n\n         Adverse possession presents questions of both law and fact. The trier of\n\nfact determines whether the essential facts exist, and the court determines whether\n\nthose facts constitute adverse possession. Anderson v.

Curtis supplied the court with photographs\n\ntaken from 1976 through 2009. Curtis presented a 1983 photograph in which the\n\nfence posts were stereoscopically discernible. From that information, he drew a\n\nline through the fence posts supporting the previous owners' testimony that the\n\nhistoric fence line was a straight line.33\n\n        Rollins testified that he had rented a portion of the Blakey property to\n\nprovide feed for his cows.34 Aerial photographs showed the hedgerow to be a\n\nconsistent straight line on the Wren side, while the hedgerow on the Blakey\n\nproperty continued to expand eastward into that property.35\n\n\n\n\n32 Ex. 6; RP at 143.\n33 Ex. 28; RP at 160.\n34 RP at 93.\n35 Ex. 13, 14, 17.\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/8\n\n\n       Blakey claims that her repairing the fence in 1990 is sufficient to satisfy the\n\nelements needed to establish adverse possession.

The statute provides that a person acts\n\n\"'wrongfully if the person intentionally and unreasonably commits the act or acts\n\nwhile knowing, or having reason to know, that he or she lacks authorization to so\n\nact.'\" The trial court found that Blakey's statement that she owned the property by\n\nadverse possession in effect acknowledged that she did not have rightful\n\npossession to the property and thus her occupation of that land was intentional.45\n\nAttorney Fees\n\n       In addition to providing an award of treble damages for intentional trespass,\n\nRCW 4.24.630 provides for the award of attorney fees. Wren submitted a detailed\n\naffidavit, including the hours billed and the type of work performed. The court\n\nreviewed these records and made an adjustment.\n\n       Blakey argues the trial court abused its discretion by not segregating\n\nattorney fees. Blakey contends that Wren was entitled to fees only for that portion\n\nof his claim that pertained to intentional trespass and not those used to defeat the\n\nadverse possession claim. Blakey argues that Wren's claims did not involve the\n\nsame core facts or related legal theories. But it is clear that the trespass occurred\n\nbecause of Blakey's illegal assertion of adverse possession. It was that trespass\n\nthat caused Wren to bring an action to quiet title and seek damages for trespass.46\n\n\n\n\n44 CP at 89, FF 16 (unchallenged).\n45 CP at 10 (Memorandum Decision, p. 5).\n46 Blakey asserts the timber trespass claim as an unsuccessful claim.

Because we have\n\ndetermined that no segregation was necessary, we affirm the trial court's award of\n\nfees.\n\n        Wren requests an award of attorney fees on appeal based on RCW\n\n4.24.630 and RAP 18.1. \"A party may recover attorney fees and costs on appeal\n\n\n49174Wn.2dat81.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fNo. 70691-8-1/14\n\n\nwhen granted by applicable law.\" Oregon Mut.
