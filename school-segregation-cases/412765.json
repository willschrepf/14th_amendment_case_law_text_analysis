(ASP). Mr. Richardson brought this suit under Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., alleging that (1) ASP discriminated against him\n\ndue to his gender when it removed him from a supervisory position and replaced him with a\n\nwoman, and (2) ASP retaliated against him by declining to put him on the work schedule after he\n\ncomplained of discrimination. ASP moves for summary judgment. The motion will be granted\n\nin part and denied in part: judgment on the discrimination claim will be entered in favor of ASP,\n\nbut the motion will be denied on the retaliation claim.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               Mr. Richardson worked as a security guard for ASP from December 7, 2009, until\n\nApril 20, 2009, at 500 and 800 North Capitol in Washington, D.C. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶¶ 9, 11. He\n\nwas assigned as an armed security officer on ASP’s contract with the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity. During this time period, he also worked for two other employers: Coastal\n\nInternational Security and Wackenhut Corporation. Mot. for Summ. J. (MSJ) [Dkt. 16], Ex. A\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f(Richardson Dep.) at 53. Among these three jobs, Mr. Richardson worked 101 to 106 hours per\n\nweek. Id. at 54. ASP initially scheduled Mr. Richardson’s shift to accommodate his other jobs,\n\npermitting him to start work later than the regularly scheduled shift. Id. at 68. Mr. Richardson\n\ndeclares that ASP allowed the flexible schedule because it was “desperately in need of officers.”\n\nOpp’n [Dkt. 17], Ex. 1 (Richardson Decl.) ¶ 3.\n\n               When Mr. Richardson started working for ASP, Lieutenant Barbara Powell was\n\nhis supervisor. Richardson Dep. at 83, 90. Lt. Powell had worked at the North Capitol site since\n\nbefore ASP took over the security contract there. Sergeant Osman Kamara ran day-to-day\n\noperations at the site and set the work schedules. Id. at 78. ASP’s Program Manager, Mark\n\nPhinney, oversaw the overall security operations at 500 and 800 North Capitol.\n\n               ASP requires all of its security officers stationed at 500 and 800 North Capitol to\n\nmaintain a gun certification. In February 2010, Lt. Powell failed to renew her certification on\n\ntime. In accordance with ASP policy, ASP placed her on leave and gave her thirty days to renew\n\nthe certification. ASP appointed Sergeant Alimany Kanu as supervisor in place of Lt. Powell\n\nduring her initial thirty-day absence. Id. at 97.\n\n               When the initial thirty-day period expired, Lt. Powell still had failed to renew her\n\nweapons certification. On March 28, 2010, ASP placed Mr. Richardson in the supervisor\n\nposition formerly held by Lt. Powell. Id. at 99. Mr. Richardson believed that this placement was\n\n“permanent.” Opp’n at 2. ASP allows supervisors to work a flexible schedule. In April 2010,\n\nhowever, ASP ceased its practice of allowing security guards to work a flexible schedule. MSJ,\n\nEx. B (Phinney Decl.) ¶ 6. Mr. Richardson was not aware of the policy change. Richardson\n\nDep. at 166. Mr. Richardson believes that ASP allowed two security guards, Casandra Davis\n\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fand a “Mr. Henry” to maintain flexible shifts even after the ASP scheduling policy changed. See\n\nOpp’n at 2-3.\n\n                In late March 2010, Lt. Powell passed her gun certification, but she was one day\n\npast the thirty-day time period in which she was required to recertify in order to maintain her\n\nposition and shift. Lt. Powell filed a grievance, with union representation, seeking reinstatement.\n\nASP reinstated Lt. Powell as a security officer, but not a supervisor, and she began working\n\nagain on April 3, 2010.\n\n                Lt. Powell pursued a second grievance, this time without union representation,\n\nseeking to return to her prior position as a supervisor. 1 See MSJ, Ex. D (Reichelt Decl.) 2 ¶¶ 5-6.\n\nIn the meantime, Mike Kilby, the U.S. Government’s Agency Technical Representative at the\n\nbuilding, who had worked with Lt. Powell since before ASP took over the contract, asked ASP\n\nabout Lt. Powell’s apparent demotion. Reichert Decl. ¶ 7. Thereafter, ASP reinstated Lt. Powell\n\nto the supervisory position because (1) Mr. Kilby had inquired and (2) Lt. Powell had worked at\n\nthe North Capitol site for a long time. Id.\n\n                Mr. Phinney scheduled Lt. Powell for her previous supervisor shift, on which Mr.\n\nRichardson had been working. MSJ, Ex. C (Phinney Dep.) at 43. Because Lt. Powell was\n\nreturned to that shift, Mr. Richardson was no longer scheduled to work as a supervisor. The last\n\ndate on which Mr. Richardson worked for ASP was April 20, 2014. See Opp’n, Ex. 1, Att. C\n\n(Change in Status Form) at 1. He did not work any shifts, either as a supervisor or as a security\n\n\n\n1\n  ASP has a grievance process whereby any employee, including a supervisor, can raise concerns\nregarding discrimination or any other matter. MSJ, Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 5; see\nOpp’n at 2 (indicating that Plaintiff does not dispute this fact); see also Richardson Dep. at 73\n(acknowledging the ASP policy permitting all employees to utilize a grievance procedure).\n2\n    Jennifer Reichelt was ASP’s Vice President of Human Resources at the time.\n\n                                                 3\n\fguard, after he lost the supervisor spot. See Richardson Decl. ¶ 14. Over four months later, on\n\nSeptember 5, 2010, ASP terminated Mr. Richardson. See Richardson Dep. at 219.\n\n               Sometime after his last shift at ASP, Mr. Richardson submitted a written\n\ncomplaint of gender discrimination to ASP.3 Mr. Richardson exhausted federal administrative\n\nremedies by filing a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC). Compl. ¶ 6. He received a Right To Sue Letter from the EEOC on December 15,\n\n2011, and filed this Complaint on March 15, 2012. Id. ¶ 7. Count I of the Complaint alleges that\n\nASP discriminated against Mr. Richardson because of his gender “in removing him from his\n\nposition and replacing him with a female who previously lost her supervisory position because\n\nshe was not able to qualify with her weapon within 30 days, as required.” Id. ¶ 18. Count II\n\nalleges retaliation in that after Mr. Richardson complained to Sgt. Kamara and Mr. Phinney of\n\ngender discrimination, ASP did not offer him any shifts and constructively terminated him. Id. ¶\n\n25.\n\n                                   II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n               Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall\n\nbe granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). On summary judgment, the burden on a moving\n\nparty who does not bear the ultimate burden of proof may be satisfied by making an initial\n\nshowing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. Celotex\n\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). This burden “may be discharged by ‘showing’––that\n\n\n3\n  The parties dispute the date on which Mr. Richardson first submitted a complaint of gender\ndiscrimination to ASP. This is discussed in more detail below with respect to the retaliation\nclaim.\n\n                                                4\n\fis, pointing out to the district court––that there is an absence of evidence to support the\n\nnonmoving party’s case.” Id. The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate the\n\nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. The nonmovant may not rest on mere allegations or\n\ndenials, but must instead by affidavit or otherwise, present specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; see also Greene v.\n\nDalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (nonmovant must present specific facts that would\n\nenable a reasonable jury to find in its favor). “[B]are allegations of discrimination are\n\ninsufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.” Burke v. Gould, 286\n\nF.3d 513, 520 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n               In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable\n\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party,\n\nhowever, must establish more than “the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of\n\nits position. Id. at 252. In addition, if the evidence “is merely colorable, or is not significantly\n\nprobative, summary judgment may be granted.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50 (citations\n\nomitted). Summary judgment is properly granted against a party who “after adequate time for\n\ndiscovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an\n\nelement essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\n\ntrial.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.\n\n\n                                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n               A. Discrimination\n\n               Title VII prohibits status-based discrimination, i.e., it prohibits an employer from\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in hiring decisions, in\n\ncompensation, terms, and conditions of employment, and in classifying employees in a way that\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fwould adversely affect their status as employees. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. 4 To prove\n\ndiscrimination, a plaintiff can point to direct evidence linking the adverse personnel action to a\n\nforbidden motive. If the plaintiff offers direct evidence of discriminatory intent, such evidence\n\ngenerally entitles the plaintiff to a jury trial. See Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae, 712 F.3d 572, 576\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (quoting Vatel v. Alliance of Auto. Mfrs., 627 F.3d 1245, 1247\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011)). If a plaintiff does not offer direct evidence and instead points only to\n\ncircumstantial evidence, courts apply the burden shifting framework set forth in McDonnell\n\nDouglas. Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citing McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). Here, Mr. Richardson concedes that there is no\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination, and thus the burden shifting framework applies. See Opp’n at\n\n7.\n\n                Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination by showing (1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he suffered an\n\n\n4\n    Section 2000e-2 provides:\n\n                It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer––\n\n                (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\n                otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n                compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n                because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n                origin; or\n\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n                employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n                any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\n                affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race,\n                color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. The Supreme Court has distinguished between claims asserting “status-\nbased discrimination” under § 2000e-2 and claims asserting retaliation under § 2000e-3. See\nUniv. of Texas SW Medical Ctr. v. Nasser, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2525 (2013).\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fadverse personnel action; (3) under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\n\nRoyall v. Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 548 F.3d 137, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Once a\n\nplaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to “articulate some\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the employer’s action. Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the defendant\n\nasserts a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, the plaintiff still may prove\n\ndiscrimination by showing “pretext,” i.e., that the legitimate reasons offered by the employer\n\nwere not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253;\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44 (2003).\n\nWhen an employer articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the existence of a prima\n\nfacie case becomes irrelevant and the district court determines, based on all the evidence,\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could conclude that the employer’s proffered non-discriminatory\n\nreason was not the actual reason but was pretext for intentional discrimination. Brady v. Office\n\nof the Sgt. at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n                A Title VII plaintiff must demonstrate causation, i.e., that there is a link between\n\nthe injury sustained and the wrong alleged. Univ. of Tex. SW Med. Ctr. v. Nasser, 133 S. Ct.\n\n2517, 2522 (2013). “An employee who alleges status-based discrimination under Title VII need\n\nnot show that the causal link between injury and wrong is so close that the injury would not have\n\noccurred but for the act.” Id. Such a plaintiff need show only that “the motive to discriminate\n\nwas one of the employer’s motives, even if the employer also had other lawful motives that were\n\ncausative in the employer’s decision.” Id. at 2522-23. 5\n\n\n\n\n5\n    In 1991, Congress codified the motivating factor standard by adding § 2000e-2(m) to Title VII:\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f               Count I of Mr. Richardson’s Complaint alleges that ASP discriminated against\n\nMr. Richardson because of his gender “in removing him from his position and replacing him\n\nwith a female who previously lost her supervisory position because she was not able to qualify\n\nwith her weapon within 30 days, as required.” Compl. ¶ 18. Because ASP has asserted\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for removing Mr. Richardson from the supervisor position, the Court\n\nproceeds to this question: has Mr. Richardson raised a genuine issue of material fact that ASP’s\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for his removal was pretextual and, in fact, the real reason was\n\nmotivated by gender discrimination? See Brady, 520 F.3d at 494.\n\n               ASP contends that it removed Mr. Richardson from the supervisory position\n\nsimply because it reinstated Lt. Powell. Ms. Reichelt explained ASP’s reasons for the\n\nreinstatement of Lt. Powell as supervisor:\n\n               Upon listening to Powell’s grievance, I, along with others from\n               ASP determined that Powell’s tenure with the building, her one-\n               day lapse in qualification, her positive relationship with Mike\n               Kilby, the U.S. Government’s Agency Technical Representative at\n               the building, and Mr. Kilby’s recent inquiry/dissatisfaction into\n               Powell’s apparent demotion were substantial grounds to reinstate\n               her to the supervisory position.\n\nReichert Decl. ¶ 7. Lt. Powell had been working in the supervisor position for over six years\n\nbefore Mr. Richardson started with ASP. See Opp’n, Ex. 1, Att. D (Reichelt Resp. to EEOC\n\n\n               (m) Impermissible consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or\n               national origin in employment practices\n\n               Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, an unlawful\n               employment practice is established when the complaining party\n               demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a\n               motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other\n               factors also motivated the practice.\n\n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2(m). Congress also limited the damages available to a plaintiff who\nproves status-based discrimination under § 2000e-2(m). See id. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).\n\n                                                 8\n\fCharge) at 4; see also id. (“Her seniority, not her gender, is what was a determining factor in the\n\nreinstatement to her supervisory post.”). Mr. Phinney scheduled Lt. Powell for her old shift––the\n\none on which Mr. Richardson had been working. Phinney Dep. at 43. As a consequence, ASP\n\nremoved Mr. Richardson from the supervisory position.\n\n               The fact that the same person both promoted Mr. Richardson to a supervisory\n\nposition and removed him from that position undermines his discrimination claim. See\n\nWaterhouse v. District of Columbia, 124 F. Supp. 2d 1, 12-13 (D.D.C. 2000) (the fact that the\n\nsame officials who fired plaintiff hired her eleven months before raised a presumption of\n\nnondiscrimination), abrogated on other grounds by Mastro v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 447\n\nF.3d 843, 851 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Mr. Phinney appointed Mr. Richardson to the supervisor\n\nposition, and soon thereafter Mr. Phinney removed Mr. Richardson from that position when Lt.\n\nPowell was reinstated. This sequence raises an inference of nondiscrimination.\n\n               Mr. Richardson attacks ASP’s reasons for reinstating Lt. Powell by asserting that\n\nMr. Kilby, the client representative at the site, did not attempt to influence ASP’s decision:\n\n               Mr. Kilby told me personally that he made inquiry because Mr.\n               Powell told him she was no longer supervisor and he did not know\n               why. Kilby explained to me that he made the inquiry because he\n               wanted to know what happened to her. He adamantly denied\n               attempting to influence Defendant’s choice of supervision in any\n               way. He denied asking Defendant to reinstate Powell to her\n               supervisory position, which he admitted would have been\n               improper.\n\nRichardson Decl. ¶ 8; see also Opp’n, Ex. 2 (Kamara Dep.) at 53-54 (testifying that Mr. Kilby\n\nsaid that he did not have anything to do with what ASP did with the supervisor position). Mr.\n\nRichardson cites only his own declaration and Mr. Kamara’s deposition, not a sworn declaration\n\nor deposition from Mr. Kilby. The statements regarding what Mr. Kilby told Mr. Richardson\n\nand Mr. Kamara are hearsay. “On summary judgment, statements that are impermissible hearsay\n\n\n                                                 9\n\for that are not based on personal knowledge are precluded from consideration by the Court.”\n\nRiggsbee v. Diversity Servs., Inc., 637 F. Supp. 2d 39, 46 (D.D.C. 2009); see also Greer v.\n\nPaulson, 505 F.3d 1306, 1315 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (a plaintiff’s statements about another\n\nemployee’s comment was “sheer hearsay” that “counts for nothing” on summary judgment).\n\n               Even if the Court were to consider the hearsay statements of Mr. Kilby, those\n\nstatements do not undermine ASP’s asserted grounds for Lt. Powell’s reinstatement: (1) Mr.\n\nKilby in fact had asked about Lt. Powell’s absence and (2) Lt. Powell had worked as supervisor\n\nat that location for years. The hearsay statements do not change the fact that Lt. Powell’s gun\n\ncertification lapsed only for one day beyond the thirty days given for her recertification. The\n\nreasons for Lt. Powell’s reinstatement were not based on her gender and do not relate to Mr.\n\nRichardson’s gender. Mr. Richardson identifies only the obvious gender difference, which,\n\nstanding alone, does not raise a genuine issue. Mr. Richardson does not identify evidence that\n\nsupports his claim that the nondiscriminatory reasons for his removal as supervisor were\n\npretextual and the real reason was gender discrimination.\n\n               Mr. Richardson complains that he knows two male officers who lost their\n\nschedules because they failed weapons qualifications within 30 days and that Lt. Powell was\n\ntreated more favorably than these men. Richardson Decl. ¶ 17. Mr. Richardson stated in his\n\ndeclaration:\n\n               I know of male officers who lost their schedule because of failing\n               their weapons qualifications within 30 days––Lynn Roddy and\n               Olubomi Temidayo. In both instances they had to bid new\n               schedules after they got their weapons qualifications back. In each\n               instance their schedule was put up for bid and they were not given\n               the schedule back even after they finally did qualify with their\n               weapon. I know that Defendant treated both females Barbara\n               Powell and Deshawn Thornton differently. In both instances, they\n               were given their prior schedules back even though they failed to\n               maintain qualifications with their weapon within a 30 day period. I\n\n                                                10\n\f               did everything in accordance with company policy but had my\n               position and schedule taken away for the benefit of Powell, who\n               violated several policies, including failing to maintain weapons\n               qualifications and then going around the chain of command and\n               appealing to [Mr. Kilby] to seek to get him to influence Defendant\n               to get her position back. Defendant regularly announced that\n               seeking to go around the chain of managerial command was a\n               serious breach of company policy. I believe that the company has\n               given false explanations for my adverse treatment in order to\n               conceal their discriminatory motive against me.\n\nId. Mr. Richardson attempts to support his disparate treatment theory––that ASP treated Lt.\n\nPowell more favorably because she is a female––through his assertion that ASP treated her more\n\nfavorably than him with regard to weapons certifications. 6\n\n               Mr. Richardson can proffer evidence of gender discrimination by demonstrating\n\n“disparate treatment,” i.e., that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated women. See\n\nNeuren v. Adduci, Mastriani, Meeks & Schill, 43 F.3d 1507, 1513-14. Proof of discriminatory\n\nmotive is critical for such claims. Anderson v. Zubieta, 180 F.3d 329, 338 (D.C. Cir. 1999). To\n\nshow that one employee was “similarly situated” to another, a plaintiff must demonstrate that\n\n“all of the relevant aspects” of plaintiff’s employment situation were “nearly identical” to those\n\nof the comparable employee. Neuren, 43 F.3d 1514. In Neuren, for example, the D.C. Circuit\n\nconcluded that a female associate at a law firm who was terminated due to her inability to get\n\nalong with others was not similarly situated to a less senior male associate who had trouble with\n\n\n6\n  Mr. Richardson does not claim to be similarly situated to those who lost their schedules due to\nweapons certification lapses. This never happened to him and was not the asserted reason for his\nremoval from the supervisor position. He also does not assert discrimination claims on behalf of\nother employees and lacks standing to do so. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\nServs., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61\n(1992) (to have Article III standing, a plaintiff must establish: (1) he has suffered an injury in\nfact that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it\nis likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\ndecision)).\n\n                                                 11\n\flegal writing. Id.; see also Barbour v. Browner, 181 F.3d 1342, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (EPA\n\nemployees with similar job descriptions were not similarly situated because plaintiff was a GS-\n\n12 and the other employee was a GS-13 who performed some additional duties).\n\n               Mr. Richardson relies on a general and anecdotal allegation––two women retained\n\ntheir shifts at ASP after failing to regain their weapons certifications within the thirty-day period\n\nand two men lost their shifts at ASP after failing to regain their certifications within the thirty-\n\nday period. The allegation that ASP generally treats women more favorably than men fails\n\nbecause Mr. Richardson did not present evidence that “all of the relevant aspects” of the men’s\n\nemployment situations were “nearly identical” to those of the women. See Neuren, 43 F.3d\n\n1514. He does not indicate the length of the weapons certification lapses, the number of years\n\nthat these employees worked at ASP, or whether any other factor weighed in ASP’s decisions\n\nregarding these particular men and women. Likewise, Mr. Richardson fails to support his more\n\nspecific allegation, that ASP treated him less favorably than it treated Lt. Powell. He never lost\n\nhis gun certification as did Lt. Powell, but he fails to refute ASP’s reasons for reinstating Lt.\n\nPowell. The client representative (Mr. Kilby) inquired about Lt. Powell and not about Mr.\n\nRichardson. Moreover, Lt. Powell had worked as a supervisor at the location for many years,\n\nwhile Mr. Richardson had only been there one year and had worked as a supervisor for a matter\n\nof weeks. Because Mr. Richardson’s employment situation was not “nearly identical” to Lt.\n\nPowell’s situation, they were not similarly situated.\n\n               Mr. Richardson does not point to evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact\n\nthat the nondiscriminatory reasons for removing him from the supervisory position were\n\npretextual and the real reason was gender discrimination. Accordingly, summary judgment on\n\nthe claim of discrimination will be granted in favor of ASP.\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f                 B. Retaliation\n\n                 In addition to prohibiting discrimination, Title VII also prohibits an employer\n\nfrom retaliating against an employee “because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\nemployment practice by this title, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that:\n\n(1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered from a materially adverse act; 7 and (3) a\n\ncausal connection exists between the protected activity and the employer’s act. Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, 433 F.3d 889, 901-02 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “The casual connection component of the prima\n\nfacie case may be established by showing that the employer had knowledge of the employee’s\n\nprotected activity, and that the adverse personnel action took place shortly after that activity.”\n\nMitchell v. Baldrige, 759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985). To satisfy the knowledge requirement, a\n\nplaintiff must show that the official responsible for the alleged retaliatory act was aware of the\n\nprotected activity. Id. To satisfy the timing requirement, the proximity between the protected\n\nactivity and the adverse employment action must be “very close.” Moran v. U.S. Capitol Police\n\nBd., 887 F. Supp. 2d 23, 35 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268,\n\n273 (2001)). 8\n\n\n\n7\n  See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 60 (2006) (to prove retaliation, a\nplaintiff must show that the employer’s actions “would have been materially adverse to a\nreasonable employee,” in a context such that it “would likely have dissuaded a reasonable\nworker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination”).\n8\n  Some courts have held that time lags of more than three or four months are too long to show\nretaliatory causation. Breeden, 532 U.S. at 274 (adverse action taken twenty months after\nprotected activity “suggests, by itself, no causality at all”) (citing with approval O’Neal v.\nFerguson Const. Co., 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding three-month time gap\ninsufficient to establish temporal proximity)); Allen v. Napolitano, 774 F. Supp. 2d 186, 201 n.2\n(D.D.C. 2011) (“very close” means within three to four months); Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 360\n                                                  13\n\f                The same burden-shifting framework that applies to discrimination claims applies\n\nto retaliation claims , that is, when the employer articulates a nondiscriminatory reason for the\n\nalleged retaliatory action the existence of a prima facie case is unimportant. See, e.g., Prado-\n\nKronemann v. Donovan, 601 F.3d 599, 603-04 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Instead, “a court reviewing\n\nsummary judgment looks to whether a reasonable jury could infer retaliation from all the\n\nevidence, which includes not only the prima facie case but also the evidence the plaintiff offers\n\nto attack the employer’s proffered explanation for its action and [plaintiff’s] evidence of\n\nretaliation.” Gaujacq v. EDF, Inc., 601 F.3d 565, 577 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Jones v.\n\nBernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). Unlike status-based discrimination claims,\n\nretaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation and not\n\nthe lessened causation test stated in § 2000e-2(m). Nasser, 133 S. Ct. at 2533. “[A] plaintiff\n\nmaking a retaliation claim under § 2000e-3(a) must establish that his or her protected activity\n\nwas a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.” Id. at 2534.\n\n                Count II of Mr. Richardson’s Complaint alleges retaliation. Specifically, Mr.\n\nRichardson alleges that he complained to Sgt. Kamara and Mr. Phinney of gender discrimination\n\nin May 2010 and that thereafter ASP did not offer him any shifts, resulting in his constructive\n\ntermination. 9 Compl. ¶ 25. He alleges that one to two weeks after receiving notice that Lt.\n\nPowell had been reinstated as supervisor, i.e. in May 2010, he hand-delivered a written\n\ncomplaint to Sgt. Kamara and placed a copy in Mr. Phinney’s human resource inbox at 800\n\n\n\n\nF. Supp. 2d 105, 118-19 (D.D.C. 2004) (adverse action that occurred almost three months after\nprotected activity “pushe[d] the temporal requirement . . . to its outer limit”).\n9\n    The parties agree that ASP did not formally terminate Mr. Richardson until September 2010.\n                                                 14\n\fNorth Capitol. Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 12-13. He emailed his internal complaint to Sgt. Kamara\n\nand Mr. Phinney on December 15, 2010. Id. ¶ 12. 10\n\n               ASP challenges Mr. Richardson’s prima facie case, arguing that it did not receive\n\nnotice of Mr. Richardson’s gender discrimination complaint until after he was terminated in\n\nSeptember 2010. Sgt. Kamara and Mr. Phinney state that they first received notice of Mr.\n\nRichardson’s complaint when they received his December 15, 2010 email. See Kamara Dep. at\n\n68-69; Phinney Dep. at 45. Since the parties dispute when ASP first became aware of Mr.\n\nRichardson’s complaint, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Mr.\n\nRichardson can prove a prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n               Even presuming that Mr. Richardson has a prima facie case, ASP attempts to\n\nthwart his retaliation claim by asserting that it terminated him for a nondiscriminatory reason––\n\nthat he had not been available to work a security guard shift for many months. This challenge\n\nalso presents a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n               Mr. Richardson last worked for ASP on April 20, 2010. ASP terminated him on\n\nSeptember 5, 2010, when he had not worked any shifts for ASP for over four months. Due to his\n\nother jobs, Mr. Richardson was available only for a flexible shift, see Richardson Dep. at 53-54,\n\n68. ASP did not offer Mr. Richardson any shifts after it removed him from the supervisory\n\nposition, see Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 14-15, explaining that in April 2010, ASP ceased its practice of\n\nallowing security guards to work a flexible schedule. Phinney Decl. ¶ 6. ASP asserts that\n\nbecause Mr. Richardson did not tell ASP that he could work a nonflexible security guard shift\n10\n  At his deposition, Mr. Richardson testified that in May 2010 he hand-delivered and emailed a\ncomplaint of discrimination to his supervisor at ASP, but he did not keep a hard copy or an\nelectronic copy. Reply [Dkt. 18], Ex. F (Richardson Dep.) at 115-116. In a sworn declaration,\nMr. Richardson corrected his deposition testimony, explaining that he hand-delivered the internal\ncomplaint in May 2010 and that he did not email it then, but that he later followed up by sending\nthe complaint via email in December 2010. Richardson Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n                                                  15\n\fand he did not ask to be placed on the work schedule, ASP did not put him on the schedule. Mr.\n\nRichardson avers that he was not aware of the policy change, see Richardson Dep. at 166, and\n\nthat ASP allowed two security guards, Casandra Davis and a “Mr. Henry” to keep working\n\nflexible shifts even after the scheduling policy allegedly changed. See Opp’n at 2-3. He insists\n\nthat ASP terminated him, not for inactivity or because the scheduling policies actually changed,\n\nbut in fact because he complained of discrimination. Whether Mr. Richardson’s protected\n\nactivity was the “but for” cause of his termination is an issue of fact for the jury, see Nasser, 133\n\nS. Ct. at 2534, and the facts asserted by the parties raise genuine issues, including issues of\n\ncredibility. Accordingly, the Court will deny ASP’s motion for summary judgment as to the\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment [Dkt.\n\n16] will be granted in part and denied in part. Judgment on the discrimination claim will be\n\nentered in favor of ASP. There are genuine issues of material fact with regard to the retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\nDate: July 25, 2014                                                 /s/\n                                                      ROSEMARY M.

(ASP). Mr. Richardson brought this suit under Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., alleging that (1) ASP discriminated against him\n\ndue to his gender when it removed him from a supervisory position and replaced him with a\n\nwoman, and (2) ASP retaliated against him by declining to put him on the work schedule after he\n\ncomplained of discrimination. ASP moves for summary judgment. The motion will be granted\n\nin part and denied in part: judgment on the discrimination claim will be entered in favor of ASP,\n\nbut the motion will be denied on the retaliation claim.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               Mr. Richardson worked as a security guard for ASP from December 7, 2009, until\n\nApril 20, 2009, at 500 and 800 North Capitol in Washington, D.C. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶¶ 9, 11. He\n\nwas assigned as an armed security officer on ASP’s contract with the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity. During this time period, he also worked for two other employers: Coastal\n\nInternational Security and Wackenhut Corporation. Mot. for Summ. J. (MSJ) [Dkt. 16], Ex. A\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f(Richardson Dep.) at 53. Among these three jobs, Mr. Richardson worked 101 to 106 hours per\n\nweek. Id. at 54. ASP initially scheduled Mr. Richardson’s shift to accommodate his other jobs,\n\npermitting him to start work later than the regularly scheduled shift. Id. at 68. Mr. Richardson\n\ndeclares that ASP allowed the flexible schedule because it was “desperately in need of officers.”\n\nOpp’n [Dkt. 17], Ex. 1 (Richardson Decl.) ¶ 3.\n\n               When Mr. Richardson started working for ASP, Lieutenant Barbara Powell was\n\nhis supervisor. Richardson Dep. at 83, 90. Lt. Powell had worked at the North Capitol site since\n\nbefore ASP took over the security contract there. Sergeant Osman Kamara ran day-to-day\n\noperations at the site and set the work schedules. Id. at 78. ASP’s Program Manager, Mark\n\nPhinney, oversaw the overall security operations at 500 and 800 North Capitol.\n\n               ASP requires all of its security officers stationed at 500 and 800 North Capitol to\n\nmaintain a gun certification. In February 2010, Lt. Powell failed to renew her certification on\n\ntime. In accordance with ASP policy, ASP placed her on leave and gave her thirty days to renew\n\nthe certification. ASP appointed Sergeant Alimany Kanu as supervisor in place of Lt. Powell\n\nduring her initial thirty-day absence. Id. at 97.\n\n               When the initial thirty-day period expired, Lt. Powell still had failed to renew her\n\nweapons certification. On March 28, 2010, ASP placed Mr. Richardson in the supervisor\n\nposition formerly held by Lt. Powell. Id. at 99. Mr. Richardson believed that this placement was\n\n“permanent.” Opp’n at 2. ASP allows supervisors to work a flexible schedule. In April 2010,\n\nhowever, ASP ceased its practice of allowing security guards to work a flexible schedule. MSJ,\n\nEx. B (Phinney Decl.) ¶ 6. Mr. Richardson was not aware of the policy change. Richardson\n\nDep. at 166. Mr. Richardson believes that ASP allowed two security guards, Casandra Davis\n\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fand a “Mr. Henry” to maintain flexible shifts even after the ASP scheduling policy changed. See\n\nOpp’n at 2-3.\n\n                In late March 2010, Lt. Powell passed her gun certification, but she was one day\n\npast the thirty-day time period in which she was required to recertify in order to maintain her\n\nposition and shift. Lt. Powell filed a grievance, with union representation, seeking reinstatement.\n\nASP reinstated Lt. Powell as a security officer, but not a supervisor, and she began working\n\nagain on April 3, 2010.\n\n                Lt. Powell pursued a second grievance, this time without union representation,\n\nseeking to return to her prior position as a supervisor. 1 See MSJ, Ex. D (Reichelt Decl.) 2 ¶¶ 5-6.\n\nIn the meantime, Mike Kilby, the U.S. Government’s Agency Technical Representative at the\n\nbuilding, who had worked with Lt. Powell since before ASP took over the contract, asked ASP\n\nabout Lt. Powell’s apparent demotion. Reichert Decl. ¶ 7. Thereafter, ASP reinstated Lt. Powell\n\nto the supervisory position because (1) Mr. Kilby had inquired and (2) Lt. Powell had worked at\n\nthe North Capitol site for a long time. Id.\n\n                Mr. Phinney scheduled Lt. Powell for her previous supervisor shift, on which Mr.\n\nRichardson had been working. MSJ, Ex. C (Phinney Dep.) at 43. Because Lt. Powell was\n\nreturned to that shift, Mr. Richardson was no longer scheduled to work as a supervisor. The last\n\ndate on which Mr. Richardson worked for ASP was April 20, 2014. See Opp’n, Ex. 1, Att. C\n\n(Change in Status Form) at 1. He did not work any shifts, either as a supervisor or as a security\n\n\n\n1\n  ASP has a grievance process whereby any employee, including a supervisor, can raise concerns\nregarding discrimination or any other matter. MSJ, Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 5; see\nOpp’n at 2 (indicating that Plaintiff does not dispute this fact); see also Richardson Dep. at 73\n(acknowledging the ASP policy permitting all employees to utilize a grievance procedure).\n2\n    Jennifer Reichelt was ASP’s Vice President of Human Resources at the time.\n\n                                                 3\n\fguard, after he lost the supervisor spot. See Richardson Decl. ¶ 14. Over four months later, on\n\nSeptember 5, 2010, ASP terminated Mr. Richardson. See Richardson Dep. at 219.\n\n               Sometime after his last shift at ASP, Mr. Richardson submitted a written\n\ncomplaint of gender discrimination to ASP.3 Mr. Richardson exhausted federal administrative\n\nremedies by filing a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC). Compl. ¶ 6. He received a Right To Sue Letter from the EEOC on December 15,\n\n2011, and filed this Complaint on March 15, 2012. Id. ¶ 7. Count I of the Complaint alleges that\n\nASP discriminated against Mr. Richardson because of his gender “in removing him from his\n\nposition and replacing him with a female who previously lost her supervisory position because\n\nshe was not able to qualify with her weapon within 30 days, as required.” Id. ¶ 18.

ANALYSIS\n\n               A. Discrimination\n\n               Title VII prohibits status-based discrimination, i.e., it prohibits an employer from\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in hiring decisions, in\n\ncompensation, terms, and conditions of employment, and in classifying employees in a way that\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fwould adversely affect their status as employees. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. 4 To prove\n\ndiscrimination, a plaintiff can point to direct evidence linking the adverse personnel action to a\n\nforbidden motive. If the plaintiff offers direct evidence of discriminatory intent, such evidence\n\ngenerally entitles the plaintiff to a jury trial. See Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576\n\n(D.C.

Because ASP has asserted\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for removing Mr. Richardson from the supervisor position, the Court\n\nproceeds to this question: has Mr. Richardson raised a genuine issue of material fact that ASP’s\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for his removal was pretextual and, in fact, the real reason was\n\nmotivated by gender discrimination? See Brady, 520 F.3d at 494.\n\n               ASP contends that it removed Mr. Richardson from the supervisory position\n\nsimply because it reinstated Lt. Powell. Ms. Reichelt explained ASP’s reasons for the\n\nreinstatement of Lt. Powell as supervisor:\n\n               Upon listening to Powell’s grievance, I, along with others from\n               ASP determined that Powell’s tenure with the building, her one-\n               day lapse in qualification, her positive relationship with Mike\n               Kilby, the U.S. Government’s Agency Technical Representative at\n               the building, and Mr. Kilby’s recent inquiry/dissatisfaction into\n               Powell’s apparent demotion were substantial grounds to reinstate\n               her to the supervisory position.\n\nReichert Decl. ¶ 7.

As a consequence, ASP\n\nremoved Mr. Richardson from the supervisory position.\n\n               The fact that the same person both promoted Mr. Richardson to a supervisory\n\nposition and removed him from that position undermines his discrimination claim.

Mr. Richardson stated in his\n\ndeclaration:\n\n               I know of male officers who lost their schedule because of failing\n               their weapons qualifications within 30 days––Lynn Roddy and\n               Olubomi Temidayo. In both instances they had to bid new\n               schedules after they got their weapons qualifications back. In each\n               instance their schedule was put up for bid and they were not given\n               the schedule back even after they finally did qualify with their\n               weapon. I know that Defendant treated both females Barbara\n               Powell and Deshawn Thornton differently. In both instances, they\n               were given their prior schedules back even though they failed to\n               maintain qualifications with their weapon within a 30 day period. I\n\n                                                10\n\f               did everything in accordance with company policy but had my\n               position and schedule taken away for the benefit of Powell, who\n               violated several policies, including failing to maintain weapons\n               qualifications and then going around the chain of command and\n               appealing to [Mr. Kilby] to seek to get him to influence Defendant\n               to get her position back. Defendant regularly announced that\n               seeking to go around the chain of managerial command was a\n               serious breach of company policy. I believe that the company has\n               given false explanations for my adverse treatment in order to\n               conceal their discriminatory motive against me.\n\nId. Mr. Richardson attempts to support his disparate treatment theory––that ASP treated Lt.\n\nPowell more favorably because she is a female––through his assertion that ASP treated her more\n\nfavorably than him with regard to weapons certifications. 6\n\n               Mr. Richardson can proffer evidence of gender discrimination by demonstrating\n\n“disparate treatment,” i.e., that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated women.

Cir. 1999) (EPA\n\nemployees with similar job descriptions were not similarly situated because plaintiff was a GS-\n\n12 and the other employee was a GS-13 who performed some additional duties).\n\n               Mr. Richardson relies on a general and anecdotal allegation––two women retained\n\ntheir shifts at ASP after failing to regain their weapons certifications within the thirty-day period\n\nand two men lost their shifts at ASP after failing to regain their certifications within the thirty-\n\nday period. The allegation that ASP generally treats women more favorably than men fails\n\nbecause Mr. Richardson did not present evidence that “all of the relevant aspects” of the men’s\n\nemployment situations were “nearly identical” to those of the women. See Neuren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. He does not indicate the length of the weapons certification lapses, the number of years\n\nthat these employees worked at ASP, or whether any other factor weighed in ASP’s decisions\n\nregarding these particular men and women. Likewise, Mr. Richardson fails to support his more\n\nspecific allegation, that ASP treated him less favorably than it treated Lt. Powell. He never lost\n\nhis gun certification as did Lt. Powell, but he fails to refute ASP’s reasons for reinstating Lt.\n\nPowell. The client representative (Mr. Kilby) inquired about Lt. Powell and not about Mr.\n\nRichardson. Moreover, Lt. Powell had worked as a supervisor at the location for many years,\n\nwhile Mr. Richardson had only been there one year and had worked as a supervisor for a matter\n\nof weeks. Because Mr. Richardson’s employment situation was not “nearly identical” to Lt.\n\nPowell’s situation, they were not similarly situated.\n\n               Mr. Richardson does not point to evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact\n\nthat the nondiscriminatory reasons for removing him from the supervisory position were\n\npretextual and the real reason was gender discrimination. Accordingly, summary judgment on\n\nthe claim of discrimination will be granted in favor of ASP.\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f                 B. Retaliation\n\n                 In addition to prohibiting discrimination, Title VII also prohibits an employer\n\nfrom retaliating against an employee “because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\nemployment practice by this title, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that:\n\n(1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered from a materially adverse act; 7 and (3) a\n\ncausal connection exists between the protected activity and the employer’s act. Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186596\"><a href=\"/opinion/186596/holcomb-christine-v-powell-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 901-02 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “The casual connection component of the prima\n\nfacie case may be established by showing that the employer had knowledge of the employee’s\n\nprotected activity, and that the adverse personnel action took place shortly after that activity.”\n\nMitchell v. Baldrige, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450555\"><a href=\"/opinion/450555/wellington-mitchell-v-malcolm-baldrige-secretary-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985). To satisfy the knowledge requirement, a\n\nplaintiff must show that the official responsible for the alleged retaliatory act was aware of the\n\nprotected activity. Id. To satisfy the timing requirement, the proximity between the protected\n\nactivity and the adverse employment action must be “very close.” Moran v.

Instead, “a court reviewing\n\nsummary judgment looks to whether a reasonable jury could infer retaliation from all the\n\nevidence, which includes not only the prima facie case but also the evidence the plaintiff offers\n\nto attack the employer’s proffered explanation for its action and [plaintiff’s] evidence of\n\nretaliation.” Gaujacq v.

Unlike status-based discrimination claims,\n\nretaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation and not\n\nthe lessened causation test stated in § 2000e-2(m). Nasser, 133 S.

Specifically, Mr.\n\nRichardson alleges that he complained to Sgt.

He alleges that one to two weeks after receiving notice that Lt.\n\nPowell had been reinstated as supervisor, i.e. in May 2010, he hand-delivered a written\n\ncomplaint to Sgt.

Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 12-13. He emailed his internal complaint to Sgt. Kamara\n\nand Mr. Phinney on December 15, 2010. Id. ¶ 12. 10\n\n               ASP challenges Mr. Richardson’s prima facie case, arguing that it did not receive\n\nnotice of Mr. Richardson’s gender discrimination complaint until after he was terminated in\n\nSeptember 2010. Sgt. Kamara and Mr. Phinney state that they first received notice of Mr.\n\nRichardson’s complaint when they received his December 15, 2010 email. See Kamara Dep. at\n\n68-69; Phinney Dep. at 45. Since the parties dispute when ASP first became aware of Mr.\n\nRichardson’s complaint, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Mr.\n\nRichardson can prove a prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n               Even presuming that Mr. Richardson has a prima facie case, ASP attempts to\n\nthwart his retaliation claim by asserting that it terminated him for a nondiscriminatory reason––\n\nthat he had not been available to work a security guard shift for many months. This challenge\n\nalso presents a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n               Mr. Richardson last worked for ASP on April 20, 2010. ASP terminated him on\n\nSeptember 5, 2010, when he had not worked any shifts for ASP for over four months. Due to his\n\nother jobs, Mr. Richardson was available only for a flexible shift, see Richardson Dep. at 53-54,\n\n68. ASP did not offer Mr. Richardson any shifts after it removed him from the supervisory\n\nposition, see Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 14-15, explaining that in April 2010, ASP ceased its practice of\n\nallowing security guards to work a flexible schedule. Phinney Decl. ¶ 6. ASP asserts that\n\nbecause Mr. Richardson did not tell ASP that he could work a nonflexible security guard shift\n10\n  At his deposition, Mr. Richardson testified that in May 2010 he hand-delivered and emailed a\ncomplaint of discrimination to his supervisor at ASP, but he did not keep a hard copy or an\nelectronic copy. Reply [Dkt. 18], Ex. F (Richardson Dep.) at 115-116. In a sworn declaration,\nMr. Richardson corrected his deposition testimony, explaining that he hand-delivered the internal\ncomplaint in May 2010 and that he did not email it then, but that he later followed up by sending\nthe complaint via email in December 2010. Richardson Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n                                                  15\n\fand he did not ask to be placed on the work schedule, ASP did not put him on the schedule. Mr.\n\nRichardson avers that he was not aware of the policy change, see Richardson Dep. at 166, and\n\nthat ASP allowed two security guards, Casandra Davis and a “Mr. Henry” to keep working\n\nflexible shifts even after the scheduling policy allegedly changed. See Opp’n at 2-3. He insists\n\nthat ASP terminated him, not for inactivity or because the scheduling policies actually changed,\n\nbut in fact because he complained of discrimination. Whether Mr. Richardson’s protected\n\nactivity was the “but for” cause of his termination is an issue of fact for the jury, see Nasser, 133\n\nS. Ct. at 2534, and the facts asserted by the parties raise genuine issues, including issues of\n\ncredibility. Accordingly, the Court will deny ASP’s motion for summary judgment as to the\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment [Dkt.\n\n16] will be granted in part and denied in part. Judgment on the discrimination claim will be\n\nentered in favor of ASP. There are genuine issues of material fact with regard to the retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\nDate: July 25, 2014                                                 /s/\n                                                      ROSEMARY M.
