The Neighborhood Association of the\n\nBack Bay, Inc. (\"NABB\") and the Boston Preservation Alliance\n\n(\"BPA\")   (collectively    \"Plaintiffs\")       brought   suit   against   the\n\nFederal Transit Authority (\"FTA\") and Massachusetts Bay Transit\n\nAuthority (\"MBTA\"), asserting that planned modifications to the\n\nCopley Square transit station violated historical preservation\n\nstatutes.    The United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts   denied    preliminary    and    final    injunctive   relief.\n\nBecause we conclude that the plaintiffs have not established a\n\nviolation of applicable federal or state statutes, we affirm.\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n            This case primarily presents questions as to whether the\n\nFTA, in providing funding to the MBTA to make the Copley Square\n\nstation compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2000), has violated various federal\n\nstatutes designed to preserve historic properties.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            Under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165\n\n(2000), and its implementing regulations, 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.47-51,\n\npublic transit authorities receiving federal funds are required to\n\nidentify \"key stations\" in their transit stations and then make\n\nthose stations accessible to wheelchair users.           42 U.S.C. § 12147.\n\n            In 1992 the Copley Square station was identified by the\n\nMBTA as a key station, and plans were made to modify the station to\n\nmake it wheelchair accessible.          To make the station wheelchair\n\faccessible would require installation of new inbound and outbound\n\nelevators to transport wheelchair users.\n\n            Under 49 U.S.C. § 5310, the FTA provides federal funds to\n\nstate entities such as the MBTA to assist them in achieving\n\ncompliance with the ADA.         However, in providing funding, the FTA,\n\nlike other federal agencies, must ensure that the funded projects\n\ncomply    with   various     federal   statutes       dealing      with   historic\n\npreservation, including two sections of the National Historic\n\nPreservation Act (“NHPA”) -- 16 U.S.C. § 470f (“section 106\"), and\n\n16 U.S.C. § 470h-2(f) (“section 110(f)”). The FTA must also comply\n\nwith Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966\n\n(“DOTA”), 49 U.S.C. § 303 (“section 4(f)”).\n\n            The problem with the planned modifications to the Copley\n\nSquare station lies in the fact that the station is adjacent to the\n\nBoston Public Library (\"the Library\") and the Old South Church\n\n(\"the Church\"), both of which are designated as National Landmarks\n\nand are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.                    The\n\nLibrary    and   Church    are   located     within   the   Back    Bay   Historic\n\nDistrict, which is itself on the National Register of Historic\n\nPlaces, as is the existing inbound entrance headhouse to Copley\n\nstation.    The proposed modifications to the station would require\n\nuse of part of the Library steps for the inbound elevator and\n\nconstruction of an outbound elevator adjacent to the Church.                   The\n\nplaintiffs contend that the proposed modifications would violate\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsections 106, 110 and section 4(f).            Understanding plaintiffs’\n\ncontentions requires a description of these statutes, and the\n\nprocess by which the FTA sought to achieve compliance with their\n\nrequirements.\n\n           Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies, \"prior\n\nto the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the\n\nundertaking\"    to    \"take   into   account   the     effect\"   a   federal\n\nundertaking will have on \"any district, site, building, structure,\n\nor object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the\n\nNational Register\" and to \"afford the Advisory Council on Historic\n\nPreservation . . . a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard\n\nto such undertaking.\"         The regulations under this section make\n\nclear that section 106 is applicable only when the proposed action\n\nwould have an \"adverse effect\" on an historic property such as the\n\nLibrary and the Church.       36 C.F.R. § 800.5.\n\n           Section 110(f) of NHPA provides that “[p]rior to the\n\napproval   of   any   Federal    undertaking   which    may   directly   and\n\nadversely affect any National Historic Landmark” the agency “shall,\n\nto the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions\n\nas may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall\n\nafford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable\n\nopportunity to comment on the undertaking.”          A precondition to the\n\napplication of section 110(f) is an action that “may directly and\n\nadversely affect” a Landmark property, such as the Church or\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fLibrary.\n\n            Section     4(f)     provides     that     the     Secretary     of\n\nTransportation may approve a transportation project \"requiring the\n\nuse of . . . land of an historic site . . . only if: (1) there is\n\nno prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the\n\n. . . project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to\n\nthe . . . historic site . . . .\"            49 U.S.C. § 303(c) (“Section\n\n4(f)”).     The provision applies only if there is a “use” of an\n\nhistoric site.\n\n            To comply with these statutes, the FTA must find that the\n\nstate entity complies with each statute before disbursing federal\n\nfunds     for   any    transportation       project,   including      an     ADA\n\naccessibility project.         But the FTA need not undertake separate\n\nreviews under each statute. 36 C.F.R. § 800.3(b). Furthermore, in\n\ndetermining compliance with these statutes a federal agency such as\n\nthe FTA can rely on state agencies such as the MBTA, and on\n\nconsultants.      36   C.F.R.    §   800.2(a)(3).      Here,    the   FTA,   in\n\nconcluding that the Copley Station project complied with all these\n\nstatutes, relied on “information, analyses and recommendations”\n\nprepared by the MBTA.      The MBTA, in turn, relied on consultants.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            The MBTA initially addressed the requirements of the ADA\n\nin 1995.    The MBTA commissioned a consultant to perform a study,\n\nthe \"Schematic Design Report\" (the \"1995 Report\"), that explored\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\foptions for making these key stations accessible.         The 1995 Report\n\nidentified several options for locating elevators at the Copley\n\nSquare station, and listed advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nIt identified four options for locating the outbound elevator:\n\noption A located the elevator in front of the Church, and options\n\nB, C, and D located it across the street from the Church.              The\n\nreport noted that option A \"has the most serious historic adjacency\n\nissues\" with respect to the Church, but that it created \"[n]o major\n\nimpacts   on   streetscape    elements    and   infrastructure,\"   required\n\nlittle construction work, and was \"[l]ocate[d] along the main path\n\nof access.\"\n\n           The report identified two potential locations for the\n\ninbound elevator: option E located the elevator adjacent to the\n\nexisting historic wrought iron subway entrance on the Library\n\nsteps, and option F located it about 150 feet away from the\n\nexisting entrance without using the Library steps. Option E called\n\nfor the construction of a matching structure on the other side of\n\nthe existing entrance.       The 1995 Report concluded that failure to\n\nbuild this matching structure would \"seriously compromise the\n\nexplicit symmetry of the [historic landmark] composition.\" It also\n\nstated that option E “is problematic because it not only creates\n\nthe very difficult task of imposing new structures along side the\n\nintricately detailed wrought iron headhouse, but also creates many\n\ninterface problems with the Boston Public Library.”         As for option\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fF, the report noted that it had a lesser \"streetscape and urban\n\nimpact\" than option E, \"but place[d] the entrance in a remote\n\nlocation   from    the   main   entry    to    the   station,\"   which   raised\n\nquestions of ADA compliance and also posed a number of engineering\n\ndifficulties.\n\n           At some point before May 28, 2002, the MBTA settled on\n\noption E (library steps), minus the matching structure, for the\n\ninbound elevator, and option A for the outbound elevator, locating\n\nthe elevator in front of the Church.            The matching structure for\n\nthe inbound elevator was rejected because it would have been\n\npositioned above the Library's basement, making it impractical to\n\nanchor. Meetings were held with representatives of the Library and\n\nthe Church; no objection was raised to the locations of the\n\nelevators.      However, on August 22, 2003, plaintiff NABB by letter\n\nrequested various changes to the project, including the locations\n\nfor both inbound and outbound elevators. The letter requested that\n\nthe inbound elevator be placed 150 feet away from the existing\n\nLibrary entrance (option F), rather than on the Library steps, and\n\nthat the outbound elevator be placed across the street from the\n\nChurch rather than directly in front of it.                NABB did not then\n\nassert   that    the   placement   of    the   elevators   violated      federal\n\nstatutory requirements.\n\n           The MBTA first addressed the requirements of the various\n\nfederal historical preservation statutes when it requested that its\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpreservation consultant prepare a report (the \"Carolan Report\").\n\nThough entitled \"Section 106 and 4(f) Review,\" the Carolan Report\n\nonly discussed section 106 and did not mention section 4(f) at all.\n\nNor did the report address the requirements of section 110(f). The\n\nreport   described   the   project,   including   the   planned   elevator\n\nlocations, and explained the effects of the project.          The report\n\nconcluded that \"the primary effect of [the project] would be a\n\nvisual one,\" and that the selected designs \"will not interfere with\n\nexisting historic architectural structures.\"        The report did not\n\ndiscuss the alternative locations, but concluded that the planned\n\nlocations and designs for the inbound and outbound elevators would\n\nnot have an \"adverse effect\" within the meaning of section 106.\n\n           On August 29, 2003, based on the Carolan Report, the MBTA\n\nsent a letter to the FTA stating that \"[i]n view of these facts, it\n\nis our opinion that the project will have 'No Adverse Effect' on\n\nany historic resources.\"     The MBTA \"request[ed] a determination of\n\nNo Adverse Effect by FTA.\"\n\n           As the regulations require,1 the FTA by letter formally\n\nadvised the Massachusetts Historic Commission (“MHC”) of the Copley\n\nStation improvement on January 23, 2004, and requested \"[the MHC's]\n\n\n     1\n           The regulations promulgated under section 106 provide\nthat \"[i]f the agency official proposes a finding of no adverse\neffect, the agency official shall notify all consulting parties\n[here including the MHC] . . . [and] the [MHC] shall have 30 days\nfrom receipt to review the finding.\" 36 C.F.R. § 800.5(c). If the\nMHC disagrees, further consultation is required.        Id. at §\n800(c)(2).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fconcurrence in [the FTA's] determination that this project will\n\nhave no adverse effect on historic resources.\"   The parties appear\n\nto agree that this letter constitutes the FTA’s finding of “no\n\nadverse effect” under section 106.    The MHC concurred in the FTA's\n\nfinding of \"no adverse effect\" on January 29, 2004.\n\n          As required by section 4(f) regulations, in a February 5,\n\n2004, letter to the Department of the Interior (“DOI”), the FTA\n\naddressed the requirements of section 4(f); found that the project\n\ncomplied with section 4(f); and requested the DOI’s concurrence in\n\nthat finding.   The FTA found that “[b]ased on our review of the\n\nattached documentation [including the Carolan Report, renderings\n\nand schematics] as well as consultation with the Massachusetts\n\nState Historic Preservation Officer (concurrence attached) we have\n\ndetermined that [in the language of section 4(f)] there is no\n\nprudent and feasible alternative to the proposed project and that\n\nall possible measures to minimize harm have been included in the\n\nproject planning.”   The DOI concurred on May 10, 2004.\n\n          In connection with an environmental assessment required\n\nby the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”),2 the FTA on\n\n\n     2\n          NEPA   requires   federal   agencies  to   consider   the\nenvironmental impacts of agency decisions. 42 U.S.C. §§\n4321-4370(e); 40 C.F.R. § 1500-1518 (2004). Federal agencies are\nrequired to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for\nany action that could significantly affect the quality of the human\nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27. Agencies\nfile an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) in order to determine\nwhether an EIS is required. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4. If on the basis\nof the EA the agency determines an EIS is not required, the agency\n\n                                -9-\n\fDecember 30, 2004, issued a “Finding of No Significant Impact”\n\n(“FONSI”) as required by NEPA.    As part of this document the FTA\n\nfurther explained its conclusions with regard to 4(f).     The FTA\n\nacknowledged that “[a]n element of the proposed project [the\n\ninbound elevator] . . . will use land from the [Library],” and that\n\nthe alternative of placing the elevator 150 feet away had not been\n\npresented in the [MBTA’s] earlier 4(f) evaluation [the Carolan\n\nReport].   However, the report concluded that this alternative was\n\nnot “prudent and feasible” within the meaning of section 4(f)\n\nbecause it would not coincide with the circulation path of the\n\npublic to the maximum extent practicable, as required by the ADA.3\n\nThe alternatives for the outbound elevator were rejected for\n\nengineering and passenger-flow reasons.\n\n\n\n\npublishes a “Finding of No Significant Impact,” or “FONSI.” 40\nC.F.R. § 1501.4(e). Here, the FTA prepared an EA and a FONSI. The\nFONSI found that “the proposed project will have no significant\nadverse impacts on the environment,” and thus that an EIS was not\nrequired.\n     3\n          In particular, the EA stated that option F (placing the\ninbound elevator 150 feet away from the existing entrance) was not\n\"appropriate or feasible\" because it created a segregated entrance\nfor handicapped individuals, and would require the construction of\na tunnel linking the passengers to the fare collection area, or the\nimplementation of a \"caged gate\" system, which would require an\nMBTA station operator to periodically release batches of\nindividuals from a caged area at the base of the elevator. The EA\nnoted that eliminating the matching headhouse from option E\nincreased the impact of the headhouse, but explained that retaining\nthe headhouse was \"infeasible from an engineering perspective.\"\n\n                                 -10-\n\f                                        III.\n\n           Plaintiffs NABB and BPA filed suit under the APA on June\n\n9, 2005, alleging that the FTA and MBTA violated sections 106 and\n\n110(f) of NHPA, and section 4(f) of DOTA in approving the project.\n\nThe   plaintiffs     also       alleged     that     the    MBTA      had     violated\n\nMassachusetts      General     Laws   Chapter      161A,   Section     5(k),     which\n\nrequired the MBTA to afford parties a “timely opportunity” to\n\nparticipate in the development of “major transportation projects.”\n\n           Following       a     hearing,      the    district        court    denied\n\nplaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief on November 8, 2005.                        On\n\nNovember 23, 2005, plaintiffs timely appealed.                     On December 28,\n\n2005, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order setting\n\nforth its reasoning.\n\n           While     the       district     court     primarily        treated       the\n\nplaintiffs’ request as if it were a motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction   and    thus     examined     likelihood       of   success,      risk    of\n\nirreparable harm, the balance of the hardships and the public\n\ninterest, the district court’s Order and Memorandum also denied the\n\npermanent injunction.\n\n           Addressing the likelihood of success, the district court\n\nrejected   the   plaintiffs’       argument     that   the      FTA   violated       the\n\nprocedural requirements of the section 106 regulations by failing\n\nadequately to document its “no adverse effect” finding, by failing\n\nto independently review the project, or by failing to consult with\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fthe requisite “consulting parties” in reaching the conclusion that\n\nthere   would    be   no   adverse   effect.      The   district    court    also\n\nconcluded that plaintiffs had not established that the no adverse\n\neffect finding was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n           Next, the district court rejected plaintiffs’ argument\n\nthat section 110(f) was violated.              The court held that section\n\n110(f), which is triggered when an undertaking “may directly and\n\nadversely affect” a National Historic Landmark, does not apply when\n\nan agency properly determines a project has no adverse effect.\n\n           The    court    then   rejected     plaintiffs’   contention      that\n\nsection 4(f) was violated.        The court first addressed the proposed\n\ninbound elevator, and held that although the inbound elevator would\n\n“use” a historic landmark, the plaintiffs had failed to establish\n\n“prudent   and    feasible”    alternatives      to   that   use   because    the\n\nproposed alternatives failed to achieve the project’s purpose of\n\ncomplying with ADA requirements. As for the outbound elevator, the\n\ndistrict court sustained the agency’s conclusion that the planned\n\nconstruction would not directly or constructively “use” a historic\n\nlandmark, and thus section 4(f) did not apply.\n\n           Finally, the court addressed the plaintiffs’ state law\n\nclaim, and held that the MBTA had not violated section 5(k) because\n\nthe MBTA had afforded the plaintiffs a timely opportunity to\n\nparticipate in the design process.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f          Proceeding with the remaining “preliminary injunction”\n\nfactors, the district court found that there was no risk of\n\nirreparable harm because the project would have no adverse effect\n\non the properties; that the public interest would best be served by\n\nmaking the stations ADA accessible as soon as possible; and that\n\nthe balance of hardships favored the MBTA and the public because\n\nfurther delays would be expensive and could disrupt the MBTA’s ADA\n\naccessibility plans.\n\n          We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n          Judicial review here is governed by the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, which requires that agency action be\n\nset aside if the action was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or if the\n\naction failed to meet statutory, procedural, or constitutional\n\nrequirements.\n\n          Precision of expression is not the hallmark of either the\n\nhistoric preservation statutes involved here or the regulations\n\npromulgated   to   implement   those     statutes.   In   view   of   this\n\nambiguity, we defer, where appropriate, to the various agency views\n\nas to the applicable requirements.       Under the Chevron doctrine, an\n\nagency's interpretation of a statute is entitled to weight when the\n\nstatute is silent or ambiguous.          See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f(1984). We also owe deference to an agency's interpretation of its\n\nown regulations.        See United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball\n\nCo., 532 U.S. 200, 219 (2001).\n\n            Here,      we    owe      Chevron    deference       to   the     statutory\n\ninterpretations reflected in the regulations promulgated by the\n\nAdvisory Council on Historic Preservation (“ACHP”) under sections\n\n106 and 110, and promulgated by DOTA under section 4f.                      We also owe\n\ndeference   to    the       decision    of   the    FTA   interpreting        the    DOTA\n\nregulations, because the FTA is an agency within the DOT.                             See\n\nCleveland Indians, 532 U.S. at 219.                We do not owe deference to the\n\nFTA's interpretation of regulations promulgated by other agencies,\n\nsuch as the section 106 and 110(f) regulations.                       Nonetheless, we\n\nowe deference to the FTA’s no adverse effect finding under sections\n\n106 and 110, since the FTA has jurisdiction to make the finding,\n\neven though it does not have interpretive authority.                          See Adams\n\nFruit Co., Inc. v. Barrett,                  494 U.S. 638, 650 (U.S. 1990)\n\n(recognizing     that       “agency    determinations       within      the   scope    of\n\ndelegated authority are entitled to deference” even where the\n\nagency   does    not    have    interpretive        authority     and    thus   is    not\n\nentitled    to   Chevron        deference);        see    also    Conservation        Law\n\nFoundation v. Federal Highway Admin., 24 F.3d 1465, 1476-77 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that administrative decisions under section\n\n4(f) are subject to a highly deferential standard of review).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f              Underlying deference to agency action are assumptions\n\nthat the agencies are better able to articulate the pertinent\n\npolicies, and to reconcile the policies of potentially conflicting\n\nstatutes.       An equally important assumption is that the agencies\n\nwill, in fact, carefully consider the policy issues and articulate\n\ntheir resolution with clarity.                Here the goals of the historic\n\npreservation statutes potentially conflict with the mandates of the\n\nADA.     As we will see, the FTA, while adequately performing its\n\nassigned task, has fallen short of distinction in doing so, giving\n\nlittle       more    than    the   bare    minimum    attention      to   historic\n\npreservation issues.         Of even greater concern, the agencies (ACHP,\n\nDOTA, ATBCB) charged with promulgating regulations interpreting the\n\nhistoric preservation statutes and reconciling them with the ADA\n\nhave issued regulations that are in some respects cryptic and\n\nconfusing.      While we have been able to construe those regulations\n\nin the present case so as to resolve the matter at hand, the\n\ndeficiencies in the existing regulations likely invite further\n\nlitigation as to future projects.\n\n                    I.   Compliance with Section 106 of NHPA\n\n              The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C.\n\n§ 470 et seq., “requires each federal agency to take responsibility\n\nfor    the    impact     that   its    activities    may   have   upon    historic\n\nresources,      and      establishes    the   Advisory     Council   on   Historic\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fPreservation [“ACHP”] . . . to administer the Act.”                     City of\n\nGrapevine v. Dep’t of Transp., 17 F.3d 1502, 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n            Section 106 of the NHPA requires that the FTA or any\n\nother federal agency, in funding a project,\n\n     take into account the effect of the undertaking [project] on\n     any district, site, building, structure, or object that is\n     included in or eligible for inclusion in the National\n     Register. The head of any such Federal agency shall afford\n     the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation established\n     under part B of this subchapter a reasonable opportunity to\n     comment with regard to such undertaking.\n\n            The Library and Church are included in the National\n\nRegister.    Under such circumstances, the ACHP regulations require\n\nthe FTA to determine whether the project will have an “adverse\n\neffect” on the historic properties.         36 C.F.R. § 800.5.           If the\n\nagency   finds   an   adverse   effect,   then   the   agency    must    follow\n\nprocedures under section 800.6 designed to avoid or mitigate the\n\nadverse effects.      36 C.F.R. §§ 800.5(d)(2); 800.6(a),(b); 800.7\n\n(\"failure to resolve adverse effects\").           See 36 C.F.R. § 800.8\n\n(coordination with NEPA, including early 106 review).\n\n            Section 106 is a procedural statute that requires agency\n\ndecisionmakers to \"stop, look, and listen,\" but not to reach\n\nparticular outcomes.      Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Warwick Sewer\n\nAuthority, 334 F.3d 161, 166 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Plaintiffs    argue    that    for    various       reasons     the\n\nrequirements of section 106 were not met. Plaintiffs first contend\n\nthat the FTA committed procedural error during the process leading\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fup to the \"no adverse effect\" finding.         Plaintiffs complain that\n\nthe FTA did not conduct an independent analysis of historical\n\nimpacts of the undertaking and instead improperly relied on the\n\ndetermination of the Carolan Report and the MBTA.             However, the\n\nregulations expressly permit an agency to \"use the services of\n\napplicants,   consultants,    or   designees   to   prepare   information,\n\nanalysis and recommendations,\" 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(a)(3); see also\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 334 F.3d at 168 (\"The regulations\n\nthemselves explicitly contemplate the use of consultants to provide\n\nanalyses for use in the § 106 process.\").\n\n          Although the plaintiffs urge that there is no indication\n\nthat the FTA made the required independent determination, there is\n\nno specific requirement in the statute, the regulations or the APA\n\nthat the FTA provide detailed explanations for its decision or use\n\nany particular form of words signifying that it made an independent\n\ndetermination.4   Moreover, we are required to presume that the FTA\n\nabided by the statutory requirements in the absence of any showing\n\nthat it did not do so.       Bowen v. Am. Hosp. Assn., 476 U.S. 610,\n\n626-27 (1986); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\n\nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 n.9 (1983).      As the district court found\n\n\n     4\n          See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S.\n633, 655-56 (1990) (holding that the APA does not specifically\nrequire the agency to explain its decision when an informal\nadjudication is involved); Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 n. 3\n(1973) (holding that the APA’s requirement of a written explanation\non the record applies only to adjudications required to be made on\nthe record or to formal rulemaking).\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhere, “[p]laintiffs offer no credible evidence indicating that the\n\nFTA did not conduct an independent review, or that it 'rubber\n\nstamped' the MBTA's conclusion of 'no adverse effects.'”\n\n          We also see no merit in plaintiffs’ contention that the\n\ndocumentation provided to the MHC by the FTA did not adequately\n\nexplain the basis of the no adverse      effect finding.   They rely on\n\nregulations that require that the documentation “enable” reviewing\n\nparties “to understand [the] basis” of the adverse effect finding\n\nas required by the regulations.    36 C.F.R. § 800.11(a); see also 36\n\nC.F.R. § 800.11(e) (requiring documentation to support an adverse\n\neffect finding).   The plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the\n\nunderlying documentation did not address alternative locations for\n\nthe elevators, but there is nothing in the statute or regulations\n\nthat requires the consideration of alternatives in making the no\n\nadverse effect determination.      Plaintiffs’ fallback position is\n\nthat the document did not consider elevator location at all in\n\nreaching the no adverse effects finding.      This is not correct. The\n\ndocuments, including the Carolan Report, described in detail the\n\nbasis for the finding and considered the location of the elevators\n\nin making the finding.5\n\n\n     5\n          Plaintiffs’ argument that they should have been deemed\nconsulting parties because they were interested in the project and\nthat interest was well-known is also without merit.            The\nregulations expressly require parties to make a written request to\nbecome consulting parties, and gives the agency and SHPO (here the\nMHC) the discretion to decide whether to grant the request. 36\nC.F.R. § 800.3(c)(5).\n\n                                  -18-\n\f              Turning to the merits, the plaintiffs also contend that\n\nthe no adverse effect finding is not sustainable.                        Again, we\n\ndisagree.\n\n              Plaintiffs argue that the regulations promulgated under\n\nsection 106 compel a finding of \"adverse effect.\"                Their principal\n\ncontention is that locating the inbound elevator on the Library\n\nsteps will have an adverse effect on the Library.\n\n              The     section    106   regulations,    36       C.F.R.    §    800.5\n\n(\"Assessment of adverse effects\"), set forth the criteria for\n\ndetermining whether an action will have an adverse effect. Section\n\n800.5(a)      provides    that   the   “agency   official       shall    apply     the\n\ncriteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the area\n\nof potential adverse effects.”            Section 800.5(a)(1) (“Criteria of\n\nadverse effect”) provides:\n\n       An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter,\n       directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a\n       historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in\n       the National Register in a manner that would diminish the\n       integrity of the property's location, design, setting,\n       materials, workmanship, feeling or association. . . .\n       (emphasis added).\n\n              The FTA relied on various documents to support its no\n\nadverse effect finding, including its implicit conclusion that the\n\nintegrity of the Library was not compromised. The plaintiffs argue\n\nthat    the    1995    Report    would    only   support    a    finding      of   no\n\ndiminishment if the original option E had been adopted (using\n\nmatching headhouses on either side of the library) and that the\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\freport did not support such a finding with respect to the final\n\nplan that eliminated the matching headhouse.                 Plaintiffs correctly\n\npoint out that the 1995 Report concluded that the elimination of\n\nthe matching headhouse would “seriously compromise the explicit\n\nsymmetry of the composition.” (Emphasis added)6                 However, the 1995\n\nReport was not addressed to federal statutory requirements, and the\n\nFTA   primarily       relied    on   the   later   Carolan     report,   which   was\n\nprepared after the elimination of the matching headhouse, for this\n\npurpose.          The Carolan Report described the historic setting of\n\nCopley Station at length, and concluded that the selected designs\n\n“will       not     interfere    with      existing     historic     architectural\n\nstructures.”         This report amply supports the agency’s conclusion\n\nthat the inbound elevator would not have an adverse effect, i.e.,\n\nthat it would not “diminish the integrity” of the historical sites\n\nor    “change       the   character”    of   features    of    the   Library     that\n\ncontribute to its historical significance.                    The plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to show that this finding, on which the FTA relied, was\n\narbitrary or capricious.\n\n              Plaintiffs also urge that, even if the FTA was not\n\narbitrary and capricious in concluding that the proposed location\n\n\n        6\n          Plaintiffs also point to various inaccurate statements in\nthe 1995 Report. For example, the Report erroneously states that\n“the exi[s]ting steps will not be disturbed,” and that “option F\nlocat[ed] the elevator in front of the Old Library.” Plaintiffs\nhave not established that the FTA relied on these erroneous\nstatements (which are contradicted elsewhere in the 1995 Report) in\nmaking its no adverse effect finding.\n\n                                           -20-\n\fof the inbound elevator would not “diminish the integrity” of the\n\nlibrary, section 800.5(a)(2), which lists specific examples of\n\nadverse effects, compels an adverse effect finding.                    This section\n\nprovides that:\n\n      [a]dverse effects on historic properties include, but are not\n      limited to:\n\n      (i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the\n      property;\n      (ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration,\n      rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous\n      material remediation, and provision of handicapped access,\n      that is not consistent with the Secretary's standards for the\n      treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and\n      applicable guidelines . . . .\n\nPlaintiffs argue that locating the inbound elevator on the Library\n\nsteps has an adverse effect on the Library because disturbing the\n\nLibrary steps constitutes \"[p]hysical destruction of or damage to\n\nall or part of the property\" under subpart (i).\n\n            This interpretation is inconsistent with the structure of\n\nthe regulations.           Under subpart (ii) adverse effects include\n\n\"[a]lteration    of    a    property,    including       .   .   .     provision   of\n\nhandicapped access . . . that is not consistent with the Secretary\n\n[of   the   Interior’s]      standards    for    the    treatment       of   historic\n\nproperties    (36     C.F.R.   part     68)     and    applicable      guidelines.\"\n\n800.5(a)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).             Thus, subpart (ii) effectively\n\nrecognizes    that     alterations      consistent      with     the    Secretary’s\n\nregulations will not create an adverse effect if they are designed\n\nto secure handicapped access.         In this respect the regulations are\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fevidently    designed   to   avoid   potential   conflicts   with   the\n\nrequirements of the ADA.     If subpart (ii) is to be given its full\n\neffect, subpart (i) cannot compel an adverse effect finding when a\n\nproperty is physically altered to secure handicapped access in a\n\nmanner that could be said to “damage” the property.            Rather,\n\nsubpart (i) must be read to refer only to “damage” that does not\n\ncome within the purposes enumerated in subpart (ii).         In other\n\nwords, alterations for the provision of handicapped access are\n\ngoverned exclusively by subpart (ii).\n\n            We similarly reject the plaintiffs’ contentions that the\n\nplacement of the inbound elevator could violate subsection (iv)\n\n(“[c]hange of the character of the property's use or of physical\n\nfeatures within the property's setting that contribute to its\n\nhistoric significance”) and subsection (v) (“[i]ntroduction of\n\nvisual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity\n\nof the property's significant historic features”).      Again, if the\n\nproject complied with subsection (ii), it cannot be argued that it\n\nfailed to comply with subsections (iv) and (v).\n\n            We find no merit in plaintiffs’ confusing contention that\n\nthere was an adverse effect within the meaning of subpart (ii)\n\nitself.     Plaintiffs have not shown that the alterations to the\n\nLibrary steps are inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s\n\nstandards for the treatment of historic properties set out in 36\n\nC.F.R. part 68.\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f            We finally reject plaintiffs’ argument that the placement\n\nof the outbound elevator would have an adverse effect on Old South\n\nChurch; and that placement of both elevators would have an adverse\n\neffect on the design of the Back Bay region of the city, which\n\nitself appears in the National Register of Historic Places; and\n\nthat the rehabilitation of the existing wrought iron entrance would\n\nconstitute an adverse effect under subpart (ii). The FTA’s finding\n\nof no adverse effect encompassed the project as a whole, including\n\nboth the inbound and the outbound elevator.             The plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to show that this finding was arbitrary or capricious.\n\n            We conclude that the agency's finding of \"no adverse\n\neffect\" must be sustained.\n\n                 II.    Compliance with Section 110(f)\n\n            Plaintiffs next argue that even if the \"no adverse\n\neffect\" finding was proper under section 106, section 110(f) was\n\nviolated.     Section    110   of     the    NHPA   imposes    more   stringent\n\nprocedural   requirements      when    National     Historic    Landmarks   are\n\ninvolved, and is involved here because both the Library and the\n\nChurch are National Historic Landmarks.             Section 110(f) provides:\n\n     Prior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may\n     directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark,\n     the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the\n     maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions\n     as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and\n     shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a\n     reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f              The implementing regulation for section 110(f), 36 C.F.R.\n\n§ 800.10, calls for the same procedures as section 106 (i.e., the\n\nprocedures specified in 36 C.F.R. §§ 800.6 and 800.7 requiring\n\nconsultation with the ACHP), but further requires that the agency\n\n“invite the Secretary [of the Interior] to participate in the\n\nconsultation where there may be an adverse effect\" and requires\n\nthat the ACHP “report the outcome of the section 106 process . . .\n\nto the Secretary [of the Interior]. . . .”            36 C.F.R. §§ 800.10(c),\n\n(d).\n\n              Unfortunately,    in    the    course   of    the   lengthy    review\n\nprocess, the FTA did not directly address section 110(f).                         On\n\nappeal the FTA and MBTA urge that, nonetheless, the district\n\ncourt’s decision may be affirmed because section 110(f), like\n\nsection 106, is only triggered when there has been an “adverse\n\neffect,” and that the section 106 “no adverse effect” finding (that\n\nwe     have   already   sustained)      means     that     section       110(f)   is\n\ninapplicable.\n\n              Plaintiffs disagree.      They point out that the heightened\n\nplanning and consultation requirements of section 110 are triggered\n\nwhen an undertaking \"may directly and adversely affect\" a historic\n\nlandmark.       Plaintiffs     urge   that    section      110(f)   is    triggered\n\nwhenever there is a possible adverse effect, and that a no adverse\n\neffect finding is not the same as a finding that there is no\n\npossible adverse effect.\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f            We think the language of section 110(f) is ambiguous and\n\nthat this ambiguity is not resolved by the legislative history\n\nspeaking of the “higher standards” for compliance with section 110.\n\nThat committee report language was not referring to a stricter\n\nstandard for a section 110 adverse effect finding, but rather to\n\nthe higher standard imposed once an adverse effect finding has been\n\nmade.

Sess. 36-38, reprinted\n\nin U.S.C.C.A.N. 6378, 6399-6401 (“This section does not supercede\n\nSection 106, but complements it by setting a higher standard for\n\nagency planning in relationship to landmarks before the agency\n\nbrings the matter to the Council.”).\n\n            The     ACHP's   regulations,   to     which   we   owe   Chevron\n\ndeference, require an adverse effect finding as a predicate to\n\nsection 110(f)’s application.       Section 800.10 of the regulations,\n\nwhich implements section 110(f), provides that \"[w]hen commenting\n\non [undertakings that may directly and adversely affect a National\n\nLandmark], the [ACHP] shall use the process set forth in §§ 800.6\n\nthrough 800.7.\"      § 800.10(a).   This process (set forth in §§ 800.6\n\nthrough    800.7)    repeatedly   assumes   that    an   adverse   effect   is\n\npresent.    Section 800.6 is titled “resolution of adverse effects”\n\nand contains no provision for the situation where an adverse effect\n\nis absent, while section 800.7 deals with “failure to resolve\n\nadverse effects.”      In fact, during the section 106 review process,\n\nsection 800.6 (\"Resolution of Adverse Effects\") and 800.7 (\"Failure\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fto resolve adverse effects\") are triggered only after the agency\n\nfinds that there is an adverse effect under section 800.5(d)(2).\n\nLogically,   when    the   process    of    sections      800.6   and   800.7   is\n\ntriggered by section 110(f), an adverse effect must be present\n\nbecause   that      process     yields     no     result    otherwise.\n\n          Plaintiffs       appear    to    urge    that     these    regulations\n\nunreasonably interpret the statute to require a present effect, but\n\nin fact the regulations specifically contemplate situations in\n\nwhich an “adverse effect” finding may be based on future injury.\n\nThus, for example, section 800.5(a)(1) provides that \"[a]dverse\n\neffects may include reasonably foreseeable effects . . . that may\n\noccur later in time . . . .\"              Therefore, an agency's \"adverse\n\neffect\" finding would also include the situation where there \"may\"\n\nbe an adverse effect in the future.             Construing section 110(f) to\n\nbe triggered only upon a finding of adverse effect is therefore\n\nperfectly consistent with the use of the word \"may\" in section\n\n110(f).\n\n          Because we conclude section 110(f) is not implicated when\n\nthere is no adverse effect, and the FTA properly concluded that the\n\nproject would have no adverse effects, we reject plaintiffs’\n\nargument that 110(f) was violated.\n\n                  III.     Compliance with Section 4(f)\n\n          Next,     we   turn   to   plaintiffs’      claim   that      the   FTA's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fapproval of the Copley Station improvements violated section 4(f).7\n\n           Section 4(f), unlike sections 106 and 110(f), imposes a\n\nsubstantive mandate.   49 U.S.C. § 303(c) (2000).    It imposes a dual\n\nrequirement, providing that the Secretary of Transportation may\n\napprove a project \"requiring the use of land of an historic site\n\nonly if: (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using\n\nthat land; and (2) the project includes all possible planning to\n\nminimize harm to the . . . historic site resulting from the use.\"\n\n49 U.S.C. § 303(c).    The Supreme Court’s decision in Overton Park\n\nrequires   courts   reviewing   agency   action   under   the   APA   for\n\ncompliance with 4(f) to follow the traditional approach to review\n\nof administrative action.

Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 414 (1971) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A),\n\n(B), (C), (D) (1964 ed., Supp. V)).8\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that the FTA's approval of the inbound\n\nand outbound elevator locations for the Copley Station project\n\nviolates both sections 4(f)(1) and 4(f)(2).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          A recent amendment to section 4(f), dealing with projects\nwhose “uses” of historic sites have only a de minimis impact on\nthose sites, is not at issue in this case, because the 4(f) process\nin this case was concluded before the amendment’s adoption.

Mineta,\n373 F.3d 1078, 1084 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                 -27-\n\f                     A.    The Inbound Elevator\n\n                          1.   Section 4(f)(1)\n\n          Plaintiffs first argue that the placement of the inbound\n\nelevator on the steps in front of the Library constitutes a direct\n\n“use” of an historic site for which there is a “prudent and\n\nfeasible” alternative under section 4(f)(1).      Since the defendants\n\nagree that the elevator “uses” the historic site, the only issue is\n\nwhether there is a \"prudent and feasible alternative.\"\n\n          In Overton Park, the Supreme Court drew a distinction\n\nbetween feasibility and prudence.        A feasible alternative is one\n\nthat can be built as a matter of sound engineering.        401 U.S. at\n\n411; see also Druid Hills Civic Ass'n v. Federal Highway Admin.,\n\n772 F.2d 700, 715 (11th Cir. 1985).      Here, appellees do not contend\n\nthat the alternative location, away from the library steps, could\n\nnot be built.   Rather, they maintain that that alternative is not\n\n“prudent.”9\n\n          It is well settled that an alternative is not prudent if\n\nit does not meet the transportation needs of a project.10          The\n\n\n     9\n          In one respect, there is a feasibility issue. Plaintiffs\nmaintain that if the inbound elevator were to be placed on the\nlibrary steps, creating a matching headhouse was a feasible and\nprudent alternative.   The FTA’s determination that the matching\nheadhouse was not “feasible” because of engineering difficulties\nwas not arbitrary and capricious.\n     10\n          City of Bridgeton v. FAA, 212 F.3d 448, 461 (8th Cir.\n2000) (an alternative \"that does not effectuate the project's\npurposes is, by definition, unreasonable, and need not be evaluated\nin detail under    4(f)\"); Citizens against Burlington, Inc. v.\n\n                                  -28-\n\ftransportation needs of the project include ADA compliance.                     The\n\nFTA   determined   that    placing   the     handicap       accessible     elevator\n\nentrance 150 feet from the main entrance would create a segregated\n\nhandicap entrance and violate ADA regulations.11\n\n             The FTA’s conclusion in this respect is not arbitrary or\n\ncapricious.     Guidelines promulgated under the ADA require that\n\n\"accessible     route[s]   shall,    to    the    maximum     extent       feasible,\n\ncoincide with the route for the general public.\"               49 C.F.R. pt. 37,\n\napp. A     4.3.2(1).

Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 411.                Rather, the ADA deals elsewhere\n\nwith historic preservation issues, directing the Architectural and\n\nTransportation            Barriers   Compliance      Board    (\"ATBCB\")       to   issue\n\nsupplementary guidelines that include \"procedures and requirements\n\nfor   alterations           that   will   threaten    or     destroy    the    historic\n\nsignificance of qualified historic buildings and facilities as\n\ndefined           in   4.1.7(1)(a)   of   the   Uniform      Federal    Accessibility\n\nStandards [\"UFAS\"].\"           49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A, § 4.1.7.             The ATBCB\n\nhas adopted such guidelines,               See 36 C.F.R. part 1191, app. B §\n\n202.5. The DOT has adopted similar guidelines in the UFAS, section\n\n\n\n        13\n          49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A 4.3.2(1) (\"accessible route[s]\nshall, to the maximum extent feasible, coincide with the route for\nthe general public.\") (emphasis added); 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A\n10.3.1(1), 10.3.2(2) (\"[t]he circulation path, including an\naccessible entrance and an accessible route, for persons with\ndisabilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, coincide\nwith the circulation path for the general public.\") (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                           -30-\n\f4.1.7(a) of which provides that:\n\n            [a]lterations to a qualified historic building or\n            facility   shall   comply    with   [ADA   accessibility\n            requirements including the routing requirement] unless it\n            is determined in accordance with the procedures in\n            4.1.7(2) that compliance with the requirements for\n            accessibility routes . . . would threaten or destroy the\n            historic significance of the building or facility in\n            which case the alternative requirements in 4.1.7(3)\n            [providing for alternative \"minimum requirements\" for\n            accessibility routes] may be used for the feature.\n\n            Plaintiffs contend that placing the elevators on the side\n\nsteps of the Library would \"threaten or destroy\" the historic\n\nsignificance of the Boston Public Library.                      We need not in this\n\ncase delineate the precise scope of the required “threaten or\n\ndestroy”    finding.       It    is    sufficient        for   present     purposes    to\n\nconclude that a project that will not have an “adverse effect”\n\nunder    sections   106    and       110   cannot      “threaten   or     destroy”    the\n\nhistoric significance of the project for purposes of section 504 of\n\nthe ADA.    This is a situation in which the historic preservation\n\nstatutes have spoken “more specifically to the topic at hand” than\n\nthe ADA.    Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\n\n529 U.S. 120, 121 (2000).             There is no suggestion here, and it is\n\nindeed    inconceivable,        that       the   ADA   was     designed    to   be    more\n\nprotective of historical properties than the primary historical\n\npreservationist statutes themselves (sections 106 and 110).\n\n                                2.    Section 4(f)(2)\n\n            We   also     reject      plaintiffs’       contention      that    the   FTA\n\nviolated the requirement of section 4(f)(2) that it undertake “all\n\n                                            -31-\n\fpossible planning to minimize harm to the . . . historic site . .\n\n. .\"\n\n             Although the language of 4(f) does not define the set of\n\nalternatives that must be considered when performing a 4(f)(2)\n\nbalancing, we agree with our sister circuits that have held that an\n\nagency need only consider alternatives that are feasible and\n\nprudent.14    Here, as we have already discussed, plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to establish that the agency failed to consider a prudent\n\nalternative to placing the inbound elevator on the Library steps\n\n(i.e. an alternative that would achieve ADA compliance).15\n\n\n\n       14\n          Concerned Citizens Alliance, Inc. v. Slater, 176 F.3d\n686, 702 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that a “‘feasible and prudent’\ndetermination [should be applied] to the world of alternatives that\nmust be considered under 4(f)(2),” and that “the Secretary must\nconsider every ‘feasible and prudent alternative’ that uses\nhistorically significant land when deciding which alternative will\nminimize harm, but that the Secretary has slightly greater\nleeway–compared to a 4(f)(1) inquiry–in using its expertise as a\nfederal agency to decide what the world of feasible and prudent\nalternatives should be under 4(f)(2)”); Hickory Neighborhood\nDefense League v. Skinner, 893 F.2d 58, 62 (4th Cir. 1990)\n(acknowledging that 4(f)(2) contains an implied “feasible and\nprudent” test); Druid Hills, 772 F.2d at 716 (same); Louisiana\nEnvtl. Soc’y, Inc. v. Coleman, 537 F.2d 79, 86 (5th Cir. 1976)\n(same); see also City of Bridgeton v. FAA, 212 F.3d 448, 462 (8th\nCir. 2000) (“In reviewing an agency's choice among feasible and\nprudent alternatives [in its 4(f)(2) analysis], we again apply the\narbitrary and capricious standard of review.”).\n       15\n          Plaintiffs also argue that the FTA should have considered\nthe MBTA’s implementation of Charlie Fare cards, which resulted in\nthe elimination of automatic fare booths and, plaintiffs claim,\ncould have allowed the elevator to deliver passengers directly onto\nthe platform if option F had been implemented. We see no error in\nthe FTA’s failure to reopen proceedings to consider an alternative\nfirst suggested months after the review process was completed.\n\n                                 -32-\n\f                    B.    The Outbound Elevator\n\n          We also reject plaintiffs’ argument that placement of the\n\noutbound elevator on the Church sidewalk triggers section 4(f).\n\nSection 4(f) is not triggered unless a project “uses” a historical\n\nsite. Here, the parties appear to agree that the outbound elevator\n\ndoes not directly use a historic site.         Plaintiffs nonetheless\n\ncontend that placing the outbound elevator on the Church sidewalk\n\nconstitutes a “constructive” use of an historic site.\n\n          Under the regulations, a \"constructive\" use occurs if the\n\nimpact of locating the project near the site is \"so severe that the\n\nprotected activities, features, or attributes that qualify [it] for\n\nprotection under 4(f) are substantially impaired.\"        23 C.F.R. §\n\n771.135(p)(2).    The    regulations    are   ambiguous   as    to   what\n\nconstitutes a constructive use.    However, the regulations provide\n\nthat a constructive use does not occur when there is a finding of\n\n'no effect' or 'no adverse effect' under section 106.          23 C.F.R §\n\n771.135(p)(5)(i). Here, the FTA’s ‘no adverse effect’ finding\n\nrelated to the project as a whole, including the outbound elevator.\n\nIn light of our conclusion that the \"no adverse effect\" finding was\n\nproper, the FTA’s finding that placement of the elevator on the\n\nChurch sidewalk did not constitute a \"use\" of a historic site was\n\nnot erroneous.\n\n                  IV.    Compliance with State Law\n\n          Finally, plaintiffs urge that the MBTA, in planning the\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\fCopley Station Project, violated Section 5(k) of Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Law Chapter 161A.      Subsection 5(k) directs the MBTA to\n\nissue    regulations   “necessary    and   appropriate   to   provide   the\n\nfollowing parties the timely opportunity to participate in the\n\ndevelopment of major transportation projects . . . as defined by\n\nthe directors . . . .”       Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, § 5(k).           The\n\nrelevant parties include “state, regional and local agencies and\n\nauthorities affected by said projects . . . [and] other public and\n\nprivate organizations, groups and persons who are affected by, and\n\nwho have provided the board with reasonable notice of their desire\n\nto participate in the development of the design of [the] project.”\n\nId.   Although regulations have not been issued under the statute,\n\nwe assume that the statute itself requires timely opportunity to\n\nparticipate.\n\n            Although the MBTA urges that we decline to consider\n\ncompliance with the Massachusetts statutes under Pennhurst State\n\nSchool & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), we do not reach\n\nthe immunity question.     That question is not truly jurisdictional\n\nand thus need not be addressed before the merits of the state law\n\nclaim.    See Parella v. Retirement Bd. of Rhode Island Employees'\n\nRetirement System,     173 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\nimmunity is not a true restriction on Article III jurisdiction and\n\ntherefore need not be addressed before the merits).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\f            Turning to the merits, we find no basis to conclude that\n\nthe statutes were violated.       The MBTA afforded public and private\n\norganizations the opportunity to comment and conducted several\n\npublic meetings regarding the project.         Furthermore, even assuming\n\nthe plaintiffs had an individual right to participate and were\n\n“affected by” the project within the meaning of the statute, we\n\nagree   with   the   district   court   that   they    were    provided   with\n\nsufficient opportunity to participate.           The MBTA held a public\n\nmeeting on July 21, 2003.       Although the district court found that\n\nplaintiffs did not attend this meeting, the parties agree that they\n\ndid.    Plaintiff NABB also met with the MBTA twice more—once on\n\nAugust 5, 2003, when the design plans were 75 percent complete, and\n\nonce on March 3, 2004, prior to final federal approval.\n\n            The plaintiffs contend that the plan was essentially\n\ncomplete when they met with MBTA on August 5, 2003.             The plan had\n\nby then reached the “75 percent” stage.        But the record makes clear\n\nthat the MBTA was still soliciting comments from the public at this\n\nstage, and final federal approval had not yet occurred.              The July\n\nand August 5, 2003, meetings satisfy the statute’s requirement that\n\nthe participation occur early enough to “permit comments to be\n\nconsidered prior to the final development of or commitment to any\n\nspecific design for the project.”       Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, § 5(k).\n\nWe conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of\n\nthe    Massachusetts   statute.     Similarly,    we    find    no   merit   to\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fplaintiffs’   contention    that   the    federal   regulations   required\n\nearlier consultation with affected parties.             See 36 C.F.R. §\n\n800.1(a).\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n            Having determined that neither the FTA and MBTA acted\n\nunlawfully, we conclude that the district court properly denied\n\npreliminary   and   final   injunctive    relief.

(\"NABB\") and the Boston Preservation Alliance (\"BPA\") (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") brought suit against the Federal Transit Authority (\"FTA\") and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (\"MBTA\"), asserting that planned modifications to the Copley Square transit station violated historical preservation statutes. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied preliminary and final injunctive relief. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs have not established a violation of applicable federal or state statutes, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case primarily presents questions as to whether the FTA, in providing funding to the MBTA to make the Copley Square station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213 (2000), has violated various federal statutes designed to preserve historic properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12131-12165 (2000), and its implementing regulations, 49 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 37.47-51, public transit authorities receiving federal funds are required to identify \"key stations\" in their transit stations and then make those stations accessible to wheelchair users. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992 the Copley Square station was identified by the MBTA as a key station, and plans were made to modify the station to make it wheelchair accessible. To make the station wheelchair accessible would require installation of new inbound and outbound elevators to transport wheelchair users.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 5310, the FTA provides federal funds to state entities such as the MBTA to assist them in achieving compliance with the ADA. However, in providing funding, the FTA, like other federal agencies, must ensure that the funded projects comply with various federal statutes dealing with historic preservation, including two sections of the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\") &#8212; 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f (\"section 106\"), and 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470h-2(f) (\"section 110(f)\"). The FTA must also comply with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (\"DOTA\"), 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303 (\"section 4(f)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the planned modifications to the Copley Square station lies in the fact that the station is adjacent to the Boston Public Library (\"the Library\") and the Old South Church (\"the Church\"), both of which are designated as National Landmarks and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Library and Church are located within the Back Bay Historic District, which is itself on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the existing inbound entrance headhouse to Copley station. The proposed modifications to the station would require use of part of the Library steps for the inbound elevator and construction of an outbound elevator adjacent to the Church. The plaintiffs contend that the proposed modifications would violate sections 106, 110 and section 4(f). Understanding plaintiffs' contentions requires a description of these statutes, and the process by which the FTA sought to achieve compliance with their requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies, \"prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking\" to \"take into account the effect\" a federal undertaking will have on \"any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register\" and to \"afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation . . . a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.\" The regulations under this section make clear that section 106 is applicable only when the proposed action would have an \"adverse effect\" on an historic property such as the Library and the Church. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 110(f) of NHPA provides that \"[p]rior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark\" the agency \"shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.\" A precondition to the application of section 110(f) is an action that \"may directly and adversely affect\" a Landmark property, such as the Church or Library.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4(f) provides that the Secretary of Transportation may approve a transportation project \"requiring the use of . . . land of an historic site . . . only if: (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the . . . project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the . . . historic site . . . .\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (\"Section 4(f)\"). The provision applies only if there is a \"use\" of an historic site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To comply with these statutes, the FTA must find that the state entity complies with each statute before disbursing federal funds for any transportation project, including an ADA accessibility project. But the FTA need not undertake separate reviews under each statute. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(b). Furthermore, in determining compliance with these statutes a federal agency such as the FTA can rely on state agencies such as the MBTA, and on consultants. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.2(a)(3). Here, the FTA, in concluding that the Copley Station project complied with all these statutes, relied on \"information, analyses and recommendations\" prepared by the MBTA. The MBTA, in turn, relied on consultants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA initially addressed the requirements of the ADA in 1995. The MBTA commissioned a consultant to perform a study, the \"Schematic Design Report\" (the \"1995 Report\"), that explored options for making these key stations accessible. The 1995 Report identified several options for locating elevators at the Copley Square station, and listed advantages and disadvantages of each. It identified four options for locating the outbound elevator: option A located the elevator in front of the Church, and options B, C, and D located it across the street from the Church. The report noted that option A \"has the most serious historic adjacency issues\" with respect to the Church, but that it created \"[n]o major impacts on streetscape elements and infrastructure,\" required little construction work, and was \"[l]ocate[d] along the main path of access.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report identified two potential locations for the inbound elevator: option E located the elevator adjacent to the existing historic wrought iron subway entrance on the Library steps, and option F located it about 150 feet away from the existing entrance without using the Library steps. Option E called for the construction of a matching structure on the other side of the existing entrance. The 1995 Report concluded that failure to build this matching structure would \"seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the [historic landmark] composition.\" It also stated that option E \"is problematic because it not only creates the very difficult task of imposing new structures along side the intricately detailed wrought iron headhouse, but also creates many interface problems with the Boston Public Library.\" As for option F, the report noted that it had a lesser \"streetscape and urban impact\" than option E, \"but place[d] the entrance in a remote location from the main entry to the station,\" which raised questions of ADA compliance and also posed a number of engineering difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point before May 28, 2002, the MBTA settled on option E (library steps), minus the matching structure, for the inbound elevator, and option A for the outbound elevator, locating the elevator in front of the Church. The matching structure for the inbound elevator was rejected because it would have been positioned above the Library's basement, making it impractical to anchor. Meetings were held with representatives of the Library and the Church; no objection was raised to the locations of the elevators. However, on August 22, 2003, plaintiff NABB by letter requested various changes to the project, including the locations for both inbound and outbound elevators. The letter requested that the inbound elevator be placed 150 feet away from the existing Library entrance (option F), rather than on the Library steps, and that the outbound elevator be placed across the street from the Church rather than directly in front of it. NABB did not then assert that the placement of the elevators violated federal statutory requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA first addressed the requirements of the various federal historical preservation statutes when it requested that its preservation consultant prepare a report (the \"Carolan Report\"). Though entitled \"Section 106 and 4(f) Review,\" the Carolan Report only discussed section 106 and did not mention section 4(f) at all. Nor did the report address the requirements of section 110(f). The report described the project, including the planned elevator locations, and explained the effects of the project. The report concluded that \"the primary effect of [the project] would be a visual one,\" and that the selected designs \"will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.\" The report did not discuss the alternative locations, but concluded that the planned locations and designs for the inbound and outbound elevators would not have an \"adverse effect\" within the meaning of section 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2003, based on the Carolan Report, the MBTA sent a letter to the FTA stating that \"[i]n view of these facts, it is our opinion that the project will have `No Adverse Effect' on any historic resources.\" The MBTA \"request[ed] a determination of No Adverse Effect by FTA.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the regulations require,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the FTA by letter formally advised the Massachusetts Historic Commission (\"MHC\") of the Copley Station improvement on January 23, 2004, and requested \"[the MHC's] concurrence in [the FTA's] determination that this project will have no adverse effect on historic resources.\" The parties appear to agree that this letter constitutes the FTA's finding of \"no adverse effect\" under section 106. The MHC concurred in the FTA's finding of \"no adverse effect\" on January 29, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by section 4(f) regulations, in a February 5, 2004, letter to the Department of the Interior (\"DOI\"), the FTA addressed the requirements of section 4(f); found that the project complied with section 4(f); and requested the DOI's concurrence in that finding. The FTA found that \"[b]ased on our review of the attached documentation [including the Carolan Report, renderings and schematics] as well as consultation with the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Officer (concurrence attached) we have determined that [in the language of section 4(f)] there is no prudent and feasible alternative to the proposed project and that all possible measures to minimize harm have been included in the project planning.\" The DOI concurred on May 10, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In connection with an environmental assessment required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the FTA on December 30, 2004, issued a \"Finding of No Significant Impact\" (\"FONSI\") as required by NEPA. As part of this document the FTA further explained its conclusions with regard to 4(f). The FTA acknowledged that \"[a]n element of the proposed project [the inbound elevator] . . . will use land from the [Library],\" and that the alternative of placing the elevator 150 feet away had not been presented in the [MBTA's] earlier 4(f) evaluation [the Carolan Report]. However, the report concluded that this alternative was not \"prudent and feasible\" within the meaning of section 4(f) because it would not coincide with the circulation path of the public to the maximum extent practicable, as required by the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The alternatives for the outbound elevator were rejected for engineering and passenger-flow reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs NABB and BPA filed suit under the APA on June 9, 2005, alleging that the FTA and MBTA violated sections 106 and 110(f) of NHPA, and section 4(f) of DOTA in approving the project. The plaintiffs also alleged that the MBTA had violated Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 161A, Section 5(k), which required the MBTA to afford parties a \"timely opportunity\" to participate in the development of \"major transportation projects.\" Following a hearing, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief on November 8, 2005. On November 23, 2005, plaintiffs timely appealed. On December 28, 2005, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order setting forth its reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court primarily treated the plaintiffs' request as if it were a motion for a preliminary injunction and thus examined likelihood of success, risk of irreparable harm, the balance of the hardships and the public interest, the district court's Order and Memorandum also denied the permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing the likelihood of success, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the FTA violated the procedural requirements of the section 106 regulations by failing adequately to document its \"no adverse effect\" finding, by failing to independently review the project, or by failing to consult with the requisite \"consulting parties\" in reaching the conclusion that there would be no adverse effect. The district court also concluded that plaintiffs had not established that the no adverse effect finding was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the district court rejected plaintiffs' argument that section 110(f) was violated. The court held that section 110(f), which is triggered when an undertaking \"may directly and adversely affect\" a National Historic Landmark, does not apply when an agency properly determines a project has no adverse effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then rejected plaintiffs' contention that section 4(f) was violated. The court first addressed the proposed inbound elevator, and held that although the inbound elevator would \"use\" a historic landmark, the plaintiffs had failed to establish \"prudent and feasible\" alternatives to that use because the proposed alternatives failed to achieve the project's purpose of complying with ADA requirements. As for the outbound elevator, the district court sustained the agency's conclusion that the planned construction would not directly or constructively \"use\" a historic landmark, and thus section 4(f) did not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court addressed the plaintiffs' state law claim, and held that the MBTA had not violated section 5(k) because the MBTA had afforded the plaintiffs a timely opportunity to participate in the design process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding with the remaining \"preliminary injunction\" factors, the district court found that there was no risk of irreparable harm because the project would have no adverse effect on the properties; that the public interest would best be served by making the stations ADA accessible as soon as possible; and that the balance of hardships favored the MBTA and the public because further delays would be expensive and could disrupt the MBTA's ADA accessibility plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review here is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, which requires that agency action be set aside if the action was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" or if the action failed to meet statutory, procedural, or constitutional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precision of expression is not the hallmark of either the historic preservation statutes involved here or the regulations promulgated to implement those statutes. In view of this ambiguity, we defer, where appropriate, to the various agency views as to the applicable requirements. Under the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine, an agency's interpretation of a statute is entitled to weight when the statute is silent or ambiguous. <i>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We also owe deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations. <i>See United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,</i> 532 U.S. 200, 219, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we owe <i>Chevron</i> deference to the statutory interpretations reflected in the regulations promulgated by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (\"ACHP\") under sections 106 and 110, and promulgated by DOTA under section 4f. We also owe deference to the decision of the FTA interpreting the DOTA regulations, because the FTA is an agency within the DOT. <i>See Cleveland Indians,</i> 532 U.S. at 219, 121 S.Ct. 1433. We do not owe deference to the FTA's interpretation of regulations promulgated by other agencies, such as the section 106 and 110(f) regulations. Nonetheless, we owe deference to the FTA's no adverse effect finding under sections 106 and 110, since the FTA has jurisdiction to make the finding, even though it does not have interpretive authority. <i>See Adams Fruit Co., Inc. v. Barrett,</i> 494 U.S. 638, 650, 110 S.Ct. 1384, 108 L.Ed.2d 585 (1990) (recognizing that \"agency determinations within the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference\" even where the agency does not have interpretive authority and thus is not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference); <i>see also Conservation Law Foundation v. Federal Highway Admin.,</i> 24 F.3d 1465, 1476-77 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that administrative decisions under section 4(f) are subject to a highly deferential standard of review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying deference to agency action are assumptions that the agencies are better able to articulate the pertinent policies, and to reconcile the policies of potentially conflicting statutes. An equally important assumption is that the agencies will, in fact, carefully consider the policy issues and articulate their resolution with clarity. Here the goals of the historic preservation statutes potentially conflict with the mandates of the ADA. As we will see, the FTA, while adequately performing its assigned task, has fallen short of distinction in doing so, giving little more than the bare minimum attention to historic preservation issues. Of even greater concern, the agencies (ACHP, DOTA, ATBCB) charged with promulgating regulations interpreting the historic preservation statutes and reconciling them with the ADA have issued regulations that are in some respects cryptic and confusing. While we have been able to construe those regulations in the present case so as to resolve the matter at hand, the deficiencies in the existing regulations likely invite further litigation as to future projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

Plaintiffs first contend that the FTA committed procedural error during the process leading up to the \"no adverse effect\" finding. Plaintiffs complain that the FTA did not conduct an independent analysis of historical impacts of the undertaking and instead improperly relied on the determination of the Carolan Report and the MBTA. However, the regulations expressly permit an agency to \"use the services of applicants, consultants, or designees to prepare information, analysis and recommendations,\" 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.2(a)(3); <i>see also Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 334 F.3d at 168 (\"The regulations themselves explicitly contemplate the use of consultants to provide analyses for use in the &#167; 106 process.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the plaintiffs urge that there is no indication that the FTA made the required independent determination, there is no specific requirement in the statute, the regulations or the APA that the FTA provide detailed explanations for its decision or use any particular form of words signifying that it made an independent determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, we are required to presume that the FTA abided by the statutory requirements in the absence of any showing that it did not do so. <i>Bowen v.

Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 43 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). As the district court found here, \"[p]laintiffs offer no credible evidence indicating that the FTA did not conduct an independent review, or that it `rubber stamped' the MBTA's conclusion of `no adverse effects.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also see no merit in plaintiffs' contention that the documentation provided to the MHC by the FTA did not adequately explain the basis of the no adverse effect finding. They rely on regulations that require that the documentation \"enable\" reviewing parties \"to understand [the] basis\" of the adverse effect finding as required by the regulations. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.11(a); see also 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.11(e) (requiring documentation to support an adverse effect finding). The plaintiffs' primary contention is that the underlying documentation did not address alternative locations for the elevators, but there is nothing in the statute or regulations that requires the consideration of alternatives in making the no adverse effect determination. Plaintiffs' fallback position is that the document did not consider elevator location at all in reaching the no adverse effects finding. This is not correct. The documents, including the Carolan Report, described in detail the basis for the finding and considered the location of the elevators in making the finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, the plaintiffs also contend that the no adverse effect finding is not sustainable. Again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the regulations promulgated under section 106 compel a finding of \"adverse effect.\" Their principal contention is that locating the inbound elevator on the Library steps will have an adverse effect on the Library.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The section 106 regulations, 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.5 (\"Assessment of adverse effects\"), set forth the criteria for determining whether an action will have an adverse effect. Section 800.5(a) provides that the \"agency official shall apply the criteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the area of potential adverse effects.\" Section 800.5(a)(1) (\"Criteria of adverse effect\") provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would <i>diminish the integrity</i> of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling or association . . . . (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTA relied on various documents to support its no adverse effect finding, including its implicit conclusion that the integrity of the Library was not compromised. The plaintiffs argue that the 1995 Report would only support a finding of no diminishment if the original option E had been adopted (using matching headhouses on either side of the library) and that the report did not support such a finding with respect to the final plan that eliminated the matching headhouse. Plaintiffs correctly point out that the 1995 Report concluded that the elimination of the matching headhouse would <i>\"seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the composition.\"</i> (Emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> However, the 1995 Report was not addressed to federal statutory requirements, and the FTA primarily relied on the later Carolan report, which was prepared after the elimination of the matching headhouse, for this purpose. The Carolan Report described the historic setting of Copley Station at length, and concluded that the selected designs \"will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.\" This report amply supports the agency's conclusion that the inbound elevator would not have an adverse effect, <i>i.e.,</i> that it would not \"diminish the integrity\" of the historical sites or \"change the character\" of features of the Library that contribute to its historical significance. The plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding, on which the FTA relied, was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also urge that, even if the FTA was not arbitrary and capricious in concluding that the proposed location of the inbound elevator would not \"diminish the integrity\" of the library, section 800.5(a)(2), which lists specific examples of adverse effects, compels an adverse effect finding. This section provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]dverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that locating the inbound elevator on the Library steps has an adverse effect on the Library because disturbing the Library steps constitutes \"[p]hysical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property\" under subpart (i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is inconsistent with the structure of the regulations. Under subpart (ii) adverse effects include \"[a]lteration of a property, including . . . provision of handicapped access . . . that is not consistent with the Secretary [of the Interior's] standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 C.F.R. part 68) and applicable guidelines.\" 800.5(a)(2)(ii) (emphasis added). Thus, subpart (ii) effectively recognizes that alterations consistent with the Secretary's regulations will not create an adverse effect if they are designed to secure handicapped access. In this respect the regulations are evidently designed to avoid potential conflicts with the requirements of the ADA. If subpart (ii) is to be given its full effect, subpart (i) cannot compel an adverse effect finding when a property is physically altered to secure handicapped access in a manner that could be said to \"damage\" the property. Rather, subpart (i) must be read to refer only to \"damage\" that does not come within the purposes enumerated in subpart (ii). In other words, alterations for the provision of handicapped access are governed exclusively by subpart (ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We similarly reject the plaintiffs' contentions that the placement of the inbound elevator could violate subsection (iv) (\"[c]hange of the character of the property's use or of physical features within the property's setting that contribute to its historic significance\") and subsection (v) (\"[i]ntroduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property's significant historic features\"). Again, if the project complied with subsection (ii), it cannot be argued that it failed to comply with subsections (iv) and (v).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in plaintiffs' confusing contention that there was an adverse effect within the meaning of subpart (ii) itself. Plaintiffs have not shown that the alterations to the Library steps are inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior's standards for the treatment of historic properties set out in 36 C.F.R. part 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We finally reject plaintiffs' argument that the placement of the <i>outbound</i> elevator would have an adverse effect on Old South Church; and that placement of both elevators would have an adverse effect on the design of the Back Bay region of the city, which itself appears in the National Register of Historic Places; and that the rehabilitation of the existing wrought iron entrance would constitute an adverse effect under subpart (ii). The FTA's finding of no adverse effect encompassed the project as a whole, including both the inbound and the outbound elevator. The plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the agency's finding of \"no adverse effect\" must be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Compliance with Section 110(f)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that even if the \"no adverse effect\" finding was proper under section 106, section 110(f) was violated. Section 110 of the NHPA imposes more stringent procedural requirements when National Historic Landmarks are involved, and is involved here because both the Library and the Church are National Historic Landmarks. Section 110(f) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark, the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implementing regulation for section 110(f), 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.10, calls for the same procedures as section 106 (<i>i.e.,</i> the procedures specified in 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.6 and 800.7 requiring consultation with the ACHP), but further requires that the agency \"invite the Secretary [of the Interior] to participate in the consultation where there may be an adverse effect\" and requires that the ACHP \"report the outcome of the section 106 process . . . to the Secretary [of the Interior] . . . .\" 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.10(c), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, in the course of the lengthy review process, the FTA did not directly address section 110(f). On appeal the FTA and MBTA urge that, nonetheless, the district court's decision may be affirmed because section 110(f), like section 106, is only triggered when there has been an \"adverse effect,\" and that the section 106 \"no adverse effect\" finding (that we have already sustained) means that section 110(f) is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs disagree. They point out that the heightened planning and consultation requirements of section 110 are triggered when an undertaking \"<i>may</i> directly and adversely affect\" a historic landmark. Plaintiffs urge that section 110(f) is triggered whenever there is a possible adverse effect, and that a no adverse effect finding is not the same as a finding that there is no possible adverse effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the language of section 110(f) is ambiguous and that this ambiguity is not resolved by the legislative history speaking of the \"higher standards\" for compliance with section 110. That committee report language was not referring to a stricter standard for a section 110 adverse effect finding, but rather to the higher standard imposed once an adverse effect finding has been made. H.R.Rep. No. 1457, 96th Cong., 2d. Sess. 36-38, <i>reprinted in</i> U.S.C.C.A.N. 6378, 6399-6401 (\"This section does not supercede Section 106, but complements it by setting a higher standard for agency planning in relationship to landmarks before the agency brings the matter to the Council.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACHP's regulations, to which we owe <i>Chevron</i> deference, require an adverse effect finding as a predicate to section 110(f)'s application. Section 800.10 of the regulations, which implements section 110(f), provides that \"[w]hen commenting on [undertakings that may directly and adversely affect a National Landmark], the [ACHP] shall use the process set forth in &#167;&#167; 800.6 through 800.7.\" &#167; 800.10(a). This process (set forth in &#167;&#167; 800.6 through 800.7) repeatedly assumes that an adverse effect is present. Section 800.6 is titled \"resolution of adverse effects\" and contains no provision for the situation where an adverse effect is absent, while section 800.7 deals with \"failure to resolve adverse effects.\" In fact, during the section 106 review process, section 800.6 (\"Resolution of Adverse Effects\") and 800.7 (\"Failure to resolve adverse effects\") are triggered only after the agency finds that there is an adverse effect under section 800.5(d)(2). Logically, when the process of sections 800.6 and 800.7 is triggered by section 110(f), an adverse effect must be present because that process yields no result otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appear to urge that these regulations unreasonably interpret the statute to require a present effect, but in fact the regulations specifically contemplate situations in which an \"adverse effect\" finding may be based on future injury. Thus, for example, section 800.5(a)(1) provides that \"[a]dverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects . . . that may occur later in time . . . .\" Therefore, an agency's \"adverse effect\" finding would also include the situation where there \"may\" be an adverse effect in the future. Construing section 110(f) to be triggered only upon a finding of adverse effect is therefore perfectly consistent with the use of the word \"may\" in section 110(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude section 110(f) is not implicated when there is no adverse effect, and the FTA properly concluded that the project would have no adverse effects, we reject plaintiffs' argument that 110(f) was violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Compliance with Section 4(f)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to plaintiffs' claim that the FTA's approval of the Copley Station improvements violated section 4(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4(f), unlike sections 106 and 110(f), imposes a substantive mandate. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (2000). It imposes a dual requirement, providing that the Secretary of Transportation may approve a project \"requiring the use of land of an historic site only if: (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the . . . historic site resulting from the use.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c). The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Overton Park</i> requires courts reviewing agency action under the APA for compliance with 4(f) to follow the traditional approach to review of administrative action. <i>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> 401 U.S. 402, 414, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), (B), (C), (D) (1964 ed., Supp. V)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the FTA's approval of the inbound and outbound elevator locations for the Copley Station project violates both sections 4(f)(1) and 4(f)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Inbound Elevator</p>\n    <p>1. Section 4(f)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs first argue that the placement of the inbound elevator on the steps in front of the Library constitutes a direct \"use\" of an historic site for which there is a \"prudent and feasible\" alternative under section 4(f)(1). Since the defendants agree that the elevator \"uses\" the historic site, the only issue is whether there is a \"prudent and feasible alternative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Overton Park,</i> the Supreme Court drew a distinction between feasibility and prudence. A feasible alternative is one that can be built as a matter of sound engineering. 401 U.S. at 411, 91 S.Ct. 814; <i>see also Druid Hills Civic Ass'n v. Federal Highway Admin.,</i> 772 F.2d 700, 715 (11th Cir.1985). Here, appellees do not contend that the alternative location, away from the library steps, could not be built. Rather, they maintain that that alternative is not \"prudent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that an alternative is not prudent if it does not meet the transportation needs of a project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The transportation needs of the project include ADA compliance. The FTA determined that placing the handicap accessible elevator entrance 150 feet from the main entrance would create a segregated handicap entrance and violate ADA regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTA's conclusion in this respect is not arbitrary or capricious. Guidelines promulgated under the ADA require that \"accessible route[s] shall, to the maximum extent feasible, coincide with the route for the general public.\" 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A 4.3.2(1). With respect to \"Key Stations\" (such as Copley) \"[t]he circulation path, including an accessible entrance and an accessible route, for persons with disabilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, coincide with the circulation path for the general public.\" 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A 10.3.1(1), 10.3.2(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> These regulations respond to Congress' concern that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(2) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While plaintiffs correctly point out that the regulations thus only require that the path coincide with that of the general public to the extent that this is \"feasible\" and \"practicable,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> we read those qualifications as directed only to engineering and cost considerations and not to concerns of historic preservation. <i>Cf. Overton Park,</i> 401 U.S. at 411, 91 S.Ct. 814. Rather, the ADA deals elsewhere with historic preservation issues, directing the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (\"ATBCB\") to issue supplementary guidelines that include \"procedures and requirements for alterations that will <i>threaten or destroy</i> the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and facilities as defined in 4.1.7(1)(a) of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards [\"UFAS\"].\" 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A, &#167; 4.1.7. The ATBCB has adopted such guidelines, <i>See</i> 36 C.F.R. part 1191, app. B &#167; 202.5. The DOT has adopted similar guidelines in the UFAS, section 4.1.7(a) of which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]lterations to a qualified historic building or facility shall comply with [ADA accessibility requirements including the routing requirement] unless it is determined in accordance with the procedures in 4.1.7(2) that compliance with the requirements for accessibility routes . . . would <i>threaten or destroy</i> the historic significance of the building or facility in which case the alternative requirements in 4.1.7(3) [providing for alternative \"minimum requirements\" for accessibility routes] may be used for the feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that placing the elevators on the side steps of the Library would \"threaten or destroy\" the historic significance of the Boston Public Library. We need not in this case delineate the precise scope of the required \"threaten or destroy\" finding. It is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that a project that will not have an \"adverse effect\" under sections 106 and 110 cannot \"threaten or destroy\" the historic significance of the project for purposes of section 504 of the ADA. This is a situation in which the historic preservation statutes have spoken \"more specifically to the topic at hand\" than the ADA. <i>Food &amp; Drug Admin. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 121, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). There is no suggestion here, and it is indeed inconceivable, that the ADA was designed to be more protective of historical properties than the primary historical preservationist statutes themselves (sections 106 and 110).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Section 4(f)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject plaintiffs' contention that the FTA violated the requirement of section 4(f)(2) that it undertake \"all possible planning to minimize harm to the. . . historic site . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language of 4(f) does not define the set of alternatives that must be considered when performing a 4(f)(2) balancing, we agree with our sister circuits that have held that an agency need only consider alternatives that are feasible and prudent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Here, as we have already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to establish that the agency failed to consider a prudent alternative to placing the inbound elevator on the Library steps (i.e. an alternative that would achieve ADA compliance).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Outbound Elevator</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject plaintiffs' argument that placement of the outbound elevator on the Church sidewalk triggers section 4(f). Section 4(f) is not triggered unless a project \"uses\" a historical site. Here, the parties appear to agree that the outbound elevator does not directly use a historic site. Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that placing the outbound elevator on the Church sidewalk constitutes a \"constructive\" use of an historic site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the regulations, a \"constructive\" use occurs if the impact of locating the project near the site is \"so severe that the protected activities, features, or attributes that qualify [it] for protection under 4(f) are substantially impaired.\" 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(2). The regulations are ambiguous as to what constitutes a constructive use. However, the regulations provide that a constructive use does not occur when there is a finding of `no effect' or `no adverse effect' under section 106. 23 C.F.R &#167; 771.135(p)(5)(i). Here, the FTA's `no adverse effect' finding related to the project as a whole, including the outbound elevator. In light of our conclusion that the \"no adverse effect\" finding was proper, the FTA's finding that placement of the elevator on the Church sidewalk did not constitute a \"use\" of a historic site was not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Compliance with State Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs urge that the MBTA, in planning the Copley Station Project, violated Section 5(k) of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 161A. Subsection 5(k) directs the MBTA to issue regulations \"necessary and appropriate to provide the following parties the <i>timely opportunity to participate</i> in the development of major transportation projects . . . as defined by the directors . . . .\" Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, &#167; 5(k). The relevant parties include \"state, regional and local agencies and authorities affected by said projects . . . [and] other public and private organizations, groups and persons who are affected by, and who have provided the board with reasonable notice of their desire to participate in the development of the design of [the] project.\" <i>Id.</i> Although regulations have not been issued under the statute, we assume that the statute itself requires timely opportunity to participate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the MBTA urges that we decline to consider compliance with the Massachusetts statutes under <i>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), we do not reach the immunity question. That question is not truly jurisdictional and thus need not be addressed before the merits of the state law claim. <i>See Parella v. Retirement</i> <i>Bd. of Rhode Island Employees' Retirement System,</i> 173 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that immunity is not a true restriction on Article III jurisdiction and therefore need not be addressed before the merits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we find no basis to conclude that the statutes were violated. The MBTA afforded public and private organizations the opportunity to comment and conducted several public meetings regarding the project. Furthermore, even assuming the plaintiffs had an individual right to participate and were \"affected by\" the project within the meaning of the statute, we agree with the district court that they were provided with sufficient opportunity to participate. The MBTA held a public meeting on July 21, 2003. Although the district court found that plaintiffs did not attend this meeting, the parties agree that they did. Plaintiff NABB also met with the MBTA twice more&#8212;once on August 5, 2003, when the design plans were 75 percent complete, and once on March 3, 2004, prior to final federal approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that the plan was essentially complete when they met with MBTA on August 5, 2003. The plan had by then reached the \"75 percent\" stage. But the record makes clear that the MBTA was still soliciting comments from the public at this stage, and final federal approval had not yet occurred. The July and August 5, 2003, meetings satisfy the statute's requirement that the participation occur early enough to \"permit comments to be considered prior to the final development of or commitment to any specific design for the project.\" Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, &#167; 5(k). We conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of the Massachusetts statute. Similarly, we find no merit to plaintiffs' contention that the federal regulations required earlier consultation with affected parties. <i>See</i> 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that neither the FTA nor the MBTA acted unlawfully, we conclude that the district court properly denied preliminary and final injunctive relief.

To make the station wheelchair accessible would require installation of new inbound and outbound elevators to transport wheelchair users.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 5310, the FTA provides federal funds to state entities such as the MBTA to assist them in achieving compliance with the ADA. However, in providing funding, the FTA, like other federal agencies, must ensure that the funded projects comply with various federal statutes dealing with historic preservation, including two sections of the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\") &#8212; 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f (\"section 106\"), and 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470h-2(f) (\"section 110(f)\"). The FTA must also comply with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (\"DOTA\"), 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303 (\"section 4(f)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the planned modifications to the Copley Square station lies in the fact that the station is adjacent to the Boston Public Library (\"the Library\") and the Old South Church (\"the Church\"), both of which are designated as National Landmarks and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Library and Church are located within the Back Bay Historic District, which is itself on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the existing inbound entrance headhouse to Copley station. The proposed modifications to the station would require use of part of the Library steps for the inbound elevator and construction of an outbound elevator adjacent to the Church. The plaintiffs contend that the proposed modifications would violate sections 106, 110 and section 4(f). Understanding plaintiffs' contentions requires a description of these statutes, and the process by which the FTA sought to achieve compliance with their requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies, \"prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking\" to \"take into account the effect\" a federal undertaking will have on \"any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register\" and to \"afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation . . . a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.\" The regulations under this section make clear that section 106 is applicable only when the proposed action would have an \"adverse effect\" on an historic property such as the Library and the Church. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 110(f) of NHPA provides that \"[p]rior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark\" the agency \"shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.\" A precondition to the application of section 110(f) is an action that \"may directly and adversely affect\" a Landmark property, such as the Church or Library.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4(f) provides that the Secretary of Transportation may approve a transportation project \"requiring the use of . . . land of an historic site . . . only if: (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the . . . project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the . . . historic site . . . .\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (\"Section 4(f)\"). The provision applies only if there is a \"use\" of an historic site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To comply with these statutes, the FTA must find that the state entity complies with each statute before disbursing federal funds for any transportation project, including an ADA accessibility project. But the FTA need not undertake separate reviews under each statute. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(b). Furthermore, in determining compliance with these statutes a federal agency such as the FTA can rely on state agencies such as the MBTA, and on consultants. 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.2(a)(3). Here, the FTA, in concluding that the Copley Station project complied with all these statutes, relied on \"information, analyses and recommendations\" prepared by the MBTA. The MBTA, in turn, relied on consultants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA initially addressed the requirements of the ADA in 1995. The MBTA commissioned a consultant to perform a study, the \"Schematic Design Report\" (the \"1995 Report\"), that explored options for making these key stations accessible. The 1995 Report identified several options for locating elevators at the Copley Square station, and listed advantages and disadvantages of each. It identified four options for locating the outbound elevator: option A located the elevator in front of the Church, and options B, C, and D located it across the street from the Church. The report noted that option A \"has the most serious historic adjacency issues\" with respect to the Church, but that it created \"[n]o major impacts on streetscape elements and infrastructure,\" required little construction work, and was \"[l]ocate[d] along the main path of access.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report identified two potential locations for the inbound elevator: option E located the elevator adjacent to the existing historic wrought iron subway entrance on the Library steps, and option F located it about 150 feet away from the existing entrance without using the Library steps. Option E called for the construction of a matching structure on the other side of the existing entrance. The 1995 Report concluded that failure to build this matching structure would \"seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the [historic landmark] composition.\" It also stated that option E \"is problematic because it not only creates the very difficult task of imposing new structures along side the intricately detailed wrought iron headhouse, but also creates many interface problems with the Boston Public Library.\" As for option F, the report noted that it had a lesser \"streetscape and urban impact\" than option E, \"but place[d] the entrance in a remote location from the main entry to the station,\" which raised questions of ADA compliance and also posed a number of engineering difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point before May 28, 2002, the MBTA settled on option E (library steps), minus the matching structure, for the inbound elevator, and option A for the outbound elevator, locating the elevator in front of the Church. The matching structure for the inbound elevator was rejected because it would have been positioned above the Library's basement, making it impractical to anchor. Meetings were held with representatives of the Library and the Church; no objection was raised to the locations of the elevators. However, on August 22, 2003, plaintiff NABB by letter requested various changes to the project, including the locations for both inbound and outbound elevators. The letter requested that the inbound elevator be placed 150 feet away from the existing Library entrance (option F), rather than on the Library steps, and that the outbound elevator be placed across the street from the Church rather than directly in front of it. NABB did not then assert that the placement of the elevators violated federal statutory requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA first addressed the requirements of the various federal historical preservation statutes when it requested that its preservation consultant prepare a report (the \"Carolan Report\"). Though entitled \"Section 106 and 4(f) Review,\" the Carolan Report only discussed section 106 and did not mention section 4(f) at all. Nor did the report address the requirements of section 110(f). The report described the project, including the planned elevator locations, and explained the effects of the project. The report concluded that \"the primary effect of [the project] would be a visual one,\" and that the selected designs \"will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.\" The report did not discuss the alternative locations, but concluded that the planned locations and designs for the inbound and outbound elevators would not have an \"adverse effect\" within the meaning of section 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2003, based on the Carolan Report, the MBTA sent a letter to the FTA stating that \"[i]n view of these facts, it is our opinion that the project will have `No Adverse Effect' on any historic resources.\" The MBTA \"request[ed] a determination of No Adverse Effect by FTA.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the regulations require,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the FTA by letter formally advised the Massachusetts Historic Commission (\"MHC\") of the Copley Station improvement on January 23, 2004, and requested \"[the MHC's] concurrence in [the FTA's] determination that this project will have no adverse effect on historic resources.\" The parties appear to agree that this letter constitutes the FTA's finding of \"no adverse effect\" under section 106. The MHC concurred in the FTA's finding of \"no adverse effect\" on January 29, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by section 4(f) regulations, in a February 5, 2004, letter to the Department of the Interior (\"DOI\"), the FTA addressed the requirements of section 4(f); found that the project complied with section 4(f); and requested the DOI's concurrence in that finding. The FTA found that \"[b]ased on our review of the attached documentation [including the Carolan Report, renderings and schematics] as well as consultation with the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Officer (concurrence attached) we have determined that [in the language of section 4(f)] there is no prudent and feasible alternative to the proposed project and that all possible measures to minimize harm have been included in the project planning.\" The DOI concurred on May 10, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In connection with an environmental assessment required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the FTA on December 30, 2004, issued a \"Finding of No Significant Impact\" (\"FONSI\") as required by NEPA.

The FTA acknowledged that \"[a]n element of the proposed project [the inbound elevator] . . . will use land from the [Library],\" and that the alternative of placing the elevator 150 feet away had not been presented in the [MBTA's] earlier 4(f) evaluation [the Carolan Report]. However, the report concluded that this alternative was not \"prudent and feasible\" within the meaning of section 4(f) because it would not coincide with the circulation path of the public to the maximum extent practicable, as required by the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The alternatives for the outbound elevator were rejected for engineering and passenger-flow reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs NABB and BPA filed suit under the APA on June 9, 2005, alleging that the FTA and MBTA violated sections 106 and 110(f) of NHPA, and section 4(f) of DOTA in approving the project. The plaintiffs also alleged that the MBTA had violated Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 161A, Section 5(k), which required the MBTA to afford parties a \"timely opportunity\" to participate in the development of \"major transportation projects.\" Following a hearing, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief on November 8, 2005. On November 23, 2005, plaintiffs timely appealed. On December 28, 2005, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order setting forth its reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court primarily treated the plaintiffs' request as if it were a motion for a preliminary injunction and thus examined likelihood of success, risk of irreparable harm, the balance of the hardships and the public interest, the district court's Order and Memorandum also denied the permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing the likelihood of success, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the FTA violated the procedural requirements of the section 106 regulations by failing adequately to document its \"no adverse effect\" finding, by failing to independently review the project, or by failing to consult with the requisite \"consulting parties\" in reaching the conclusion that there would be no adverse effect. The district court also concluded that plaintiffs had not established that the no adverse effect finding was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the district court rejected plaintiffs' argument that section 110(f) was violated. The court held that section 110(f), which is triggered when an undertaking \"may directly and adversely affect\" a National Historic Landmark, does not apply when an agency properly determines a project has no adverse effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then rejected plaintiffs' contention that section 4(f) was violated. The court first addressed the proposed inbound elevator, and held that although the inbound elevator would \"use\" a historic landmark, the plaintiffs had failed to establish \"prudent and feasible\" alternatives to that use because the proposed alternatives failed to achieve the project's purpose of complying with ADA requirements. As for the outbound elevator, the district court sustained the agency's conclusion that the planned construction would not directly or constructively \"use\" a historic landmark, and thus section 4(f) did not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court addressed the plaintiffs' state law claim, and held that the MBTA had not violated section 5(k) because the MBTA had afforded the plaintiffs a timely opportunity to participate in the design process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding with the remaining \"preliminary injunction\" factors, the district court found that there was no risk of irreparable harm because the project would have no adverse effect on the properties; that the public interest would best be served by making the stations ADA accessible as soon as possible; and that the balance of hardships favored the MBTA and the public because further delays would be expensive and could disrupt the MBTA's ADA accessibility plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review here is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, which requires that agency action be set aside if the action was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" or if the action failed to meet statutory, procedural, or constitutional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precision of expression is not the hallmark of either the historic preservation statutes involved here or the regulations promulgated to implement those statutes.

An equally important assumption is that the agencies will, in fact, carefully consider the policy issues and articulate their resolution with clarity. Here the goals of the historic preservation statutes potentially conflict with the mandates of the ADA. As we will see, the FTA, while adequately performing its assigned task, has fallen short of distinction in doing so, giving little more than the bare minimum attention to historic preservation issues. Of even greater concern, the agencies (ACHP, DOTA, ATBCB) charged with promulgating regulations interpreting the historic preservation statutes and reconciling them with the ADA have issued regulations that are in some respects cryptic and confusing. While we have been able to construe those regulations in the present case so as to resolve the matter at hand, the deficiencies in the existing regulations likely invite further litigation as to future projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

The plaintiffs' primary contention is that the underlying documentation did not address alternative locations for the elevators, but there is nothing in the statute or regulations that requires the consideration of alternatives in making the no adverse effect determination. Plaintiffs' fallback position is that the document did not consider elevator location at all in reaching the no adverse effects finding. This is not correct. The documents, including the Carolan Report, described in detail the basis for the finding and considered the location of the elevators in making the finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, the plaintiffs also contend that the no adverse effect finding is not sustainable.

Section 800.5(a) provides that the \"agency official shall apply the criteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the area of potential adverse effects.\" Section 800.5(a)(1) (\"Criteria of adverse effect\") provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would <i>diminish the integrity</i> of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling or association . . . . (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTA relied on various documents to support its no adverse effect finding, including its implicit conclusion that the integrity of the Library was not compromised. The plaintiffs argue that the 1995 Report would only support a finding of no diminishment if the original option E had been adopted (using matching headhouses on either side of the library) and that the report did not support such a finding with respect to the final plan that eliminated the matching headhouse. Plaintiffs correctly point out that the 1995 Report concluded that the elimination of the matching headhouse would <i>\"seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the composition.\"</i> (Emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> However, the 1995 Report was not addressed to federal statutory requirements, and the FTA primarily relied on the later Carolan report, which was prepared after the elimination of the matching headhouse, for this purpose. The Carolan Report described the historic setting of Copley Station at length, and concluded that the selected designs \"will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.\" This report amply supports the agency's conclusion that the inbound elevator would not have an adverse effect, <i>i.e.,</i> that it would not \"diminish the integrity\" of the historical sites or \"change the character\" of features of the Library that contribute to its historical significance. The plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding, on which the FTA relied, was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also urge that, even if the FTA was not arbitrary and capricious in concluding that the proposed location of the inbound elevator would not \"diminish the integrity\" of the library, section 800.5(a)(2), which lists specific examples of adverse effects, compels an adverse effect finding. This section provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]dverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that locating the inbound elevator on the Library steps has an adverse effect on the Library because disturbing the Library steps constitutes \"[p]hysical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property\" under subpart (i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is inconsistent with the structure of the regulations. Under subpart (ii) adverse effects include \"[a]lteration of a property, including . . . provision of handicapped access . . . that is not consistent with the Secretary [of the Interior's] standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 C.F.R. part 68) and applicable guidelines.\" 800.5(a)(2)(ii) (emphasis added). Thus, subpart (ii) effectively recognizes that alterations consistent with the Secretary's regulations will not create an adverse effect if they are designed to secure handicapped access. In this respect the regulations are evidently designed to avoid potential conflicts with the requirements of the ADA. If subpart (ii) is to be given its full effect, subpart (i) cannot compel an adverse effect finding when a property is physically altered to secure handicapped access in a manner that could be said to \"damage\" the property. Rather, subpart (i) must be read to refer only to \"damage\" that does not come within the purposes enumerated in subpart (ii). In other words, alterations for the provision of handicapped access are governed exclusively by subpart (ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We similarly reject the plaintiffs' contentions that the placement of the inbound elevator could violate subsection (iv) (\"[c]hange of the character of the property's use or of physical features within the property's setting that contribute to its historic significance\") and subsection (v) (\"[i]ntroduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property's significant historic features\"). Again, if the project complied with subsection (ii), it cannot be argued that it failed to comply with subsections (iv) and (v).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in plaintiffs' confusing contention that there was an adverse effect within the meaning of subpart (ii) itself. Plaintiffs have not shown that the alterations to the Library steps are inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior's standards for the treatment of historic properties set out in 36 C.F.R. part 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We finally reject plaintiffs' argument that the placement of the <i>outbound</i> elevator would have an adverse effect on Old South Church; and that placement of both elevators would have an adverse effect on the design of the Back Bay region of the city, which itself appears in the National Register of Historic Places; and that the rehabilitation of the existing wrought iron entrance would constitute an adverse effect under subpart (ii). The FTA's finding of no adverse effect encompassed the project as a whole, including both the inbound and the outbound elevator. The plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the agency's finding of \"no adverse effect\" must be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Compliance with Section 110(f)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that even if the \"no adverse effect\" finding was proper under section 106, section 110(f) was violated. Section 110 of the NHPA imposes more stringent procedural requirements when National Historic Landmarks are involved, and is involved here because both the Library and the Church are National Historic Landmarks. Section 110(f) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the approval of any Federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark, the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implementing regulation for section 110(f), 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.10, calls for the same procedures as section 106 (<i>i.e.,</i> the procedures specified in 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.6 and 800.7 requiring consultation with the ACHP), but further requires that the agency \"invite the Secretary [of the Interior] to participate in the consultation where there may be an adverse effect\" and requires that the ACHP \"report the outcome of the section 106 process . . . to the Secretary [of the Interior] . . . .\" 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.10(c), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, in the course of the lengthy review process, the FTA did not directly address section 110(f). On appeal the FTA and MBTA urge that, nonetheless, the district court's decision may be affirmed because section 110(f), like section 106, is only triggered when there has been an \"adverse effect,\" and that the section 106 \"no adverse effect\" finding (that we have already sustained) means that section 110(f) is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs disagree. They point out that the heightened planning and consultation requirements of section 110 are triggered when an undertaking \"<i>may</i> directly and adversely affect\" a historic landmark. Plaintiffs urge that section 110(f) is triggered whenever there is a possible adverse effect, and that a no adverse effect finding is not the same as a finding that there is no possible adverse effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the language of section 110(f) is ambiguous and that this ambiguity is not resolved by the legislative history speaking of the \"higher standards\" for compliance with section 110. That committee report language was not referring to a stricter standard for a section 110 adverse effect finding, but rather to the higher standard imposed once an adverse effect finding has been made. H.R.Rep. No. 1457, 96th Cong., 2d. Sess. 36-38, <i>reprinted in</i> U.S.C.C.A.N. 6378, 6399-6401 (\"This section does not supercede Section 106, but complements it by setting a higher standard for agency planning in relationship to landmarks before the agency brings the matter to the Council.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACHP's regulations, to which we owe <i>Chevron</i> deference, require an adverse effect finding as a predicate to section 110(f)'s application. Section 800.10 of the regulations, which implements section 110(f), provides that \"[w]hen commenting on [undertakings that may directly and adversely affect a National Landmark], the [ACHP] shall use the process set forth in &#167;&#167; 800.6 through 800.7.\" &#167; 800.10(a). This process (set forth in &#167;&#167; 800.6 through 800.7) repeatedly assumes that an adverse effect is present. Section 800.6 is titled \"resolution of adverse effects\" and contains no provision for the situation where an adverse effect is absent, while section 800.7 deals with \"failure to resolve adverse effects.\" In fact, during the section 106 review process, section 800.6 (\"Resolution of Adverse Effects\") and 800.7 (\"Failure to resolve adverse effects\") are triggered only after the agency finds that there is an adverse effect under section 800.5(d)(2). Logically, when the process of sections 800.6 and 800.7 is triggered by section 110(f), an adverse effect must be present because that process yields no result otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appear to urge that these regulations unreasonably interpret the statute to require a present effect, but in fact the regulations specifically contemplate situations in which an \"adverse effect\" finding may be based on future injury. Thus, for example, section 800.5(a)(1) provides that \"[a]dverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects . . . that may occur later in time . . . .\" Therefore, an agency's \"adverse effect\" finding would also include the situation where there \"may\" be an adverse effect in the future. Construing section 110(f) to be triggered only upon a finding of adverse effect is therefore perfectly consistent with the use of the word \"may\" in section 110(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude section 110(f) is not implicated when there is no adverse effect, and the FTA properly concluded that the project would have no adverse effects, we reject plaintiffs' argument that 110(f) was violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Compliance with Section 4(f)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to plaintiffs' claim that the FTA's approval of the Copley Station improvements violated section 4(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4(f), unlike sections 106 and 110(f), imposes a substantive mandate. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (2000). It imposes a dual requirement, providing that the Secretary of Transportation may approve a project \"requiring the use of land of an historic site only if: (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the . . . historic site resulting from the use.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c). The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Overton Park</i> requires courts reviewing agency action under the APA for compliance with 4(f) to follow the traditional approach to review of administrative action. <i>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.

Rather, the ADA deals elsewhere with historic preservation issues, directing the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (\"ATBCB\") to issue supplementary guidelines that include \"procedures and requirements for alterations that will <i>threaten or destroy</i> the historic significance of qualified historic buildings and facilities as defined in 4.1.7(1)(a) of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards [\"UFAS\"].\" 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. A, &#167; 4.1.7. The ATBCB has adopted such guidelines, <i>See</i> 36 C.F.R. part 1191, app. B &#167; 202.5. The DOT has adopted similar guidelines in the UFAS, section 4.1.7(a) of which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]lterations to a qualified historic building or facility shall comply with [ADA accessibility requirements including the routing requirement] unless it is determined in accordance with the procedures in 4.1.7(2) that compliance with the requirements for accessibility routes . . . would <i>threaten or destroy</i> the historic significance of the building or facility in which case the alternative requirements in 4.1.7(3) [providing for alternative \"minimum requirements\" for accessibility routes] may be used for the feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that placing the elevators on the side steps of the Library would \"threaten or destroy\" the historic significance of the Boston Public Library. We need not in this case delineate the precise scope of the required \"threaten or destroy\" finding. It is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that a project that will not have an \"adverse effect\" under sections 106 and 110 cannot \"threaten or destroy\" the historic significance of the project for purposes of section 504 of the ADA. This is a situation in which the historic preservation statutes have spoken \"more specifically to the topic at hand\" than the ADA. <i>Food &amp; Drug Admin. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span> (2000). There is no suggestion here, and it is indeed inconceivable, that the ADA was designed to be more protective of historical properties than the primary historical preservationist statutes themselves (sections 106 and 110).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Section 4(f)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject plaintiffs' contention that the FTA violated the requirement of section 4(f)(2) that it undertake \"all possible planning to minimize harm to the. . . historic site . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language of 4(f) does not define the set of alternatives that must be considered when performing a 4(f)(2) balancing, we agree with our sister circuits that have held that an agency need only consider alternatives that are feasible and prudent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Here, as we have already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to establish that the agency failed to consider a prudent alternative to placing the inbound elevator on the Library steps (i.e. an alternative that would achieve ADA compliance).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Outbound Elevator</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject plaintiffs' argument that placement of the outbound elevator on the Church sidewalk triggers section 4(f). Section 4(f) is not triggered unless a project \"uses\" a historical site. Here, the parties appear to agree that the outbound elevator does not directly use a historic site. Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that placing the outbound elevator on the Church sidewalk constitutes a \"constructive\" use of an historic site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the regulations, a \"constructive\" use occurs if the impact of locating the project near the site is \"so severe that the protected activities, features, or attributes that qualify [it] for protection under 4(f) are substantially impaired.\" 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(2). The regulations are ambiguous as to what constitutes a constructive use. However, the regulations provide that a constructive use does not occur when there is a finding of `no effect' or `no adverse effect' under section 106. 23 C.F.R &#167; 771.135(p)(5)(i). Here, the FTA's `no adverse effect' finding related to the project as a whole, including the outbound elevator. In light of our conclusion that the \"no adverse effect\" finding was proper, the FTA's finding that placement of the elevator on the Church sidewalk did not constitute a \"use\" of a historic site was not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Compliance with State Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs urge that the MBTA, in planning the Copley Station Project, violated Section 5(k) of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 161A. Subsection 5(k) directs the MBTA to issue regulations \"necessary and appropriate to provide the following parties the <i>timely opportunity to participate</i> in the development of major transportation projects . . . as defined by the directors . . . .\" Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, &#167; 5(k). The relevant parties include \"state, regional and local agencies and authorities affected by said projects . . . [and] other public and private organizations, groups and persons who are affected by, and who have provided the board with reasonable notice of their desire to participate in the development of the design of [the] project.\" <i>Id.</i> Although regulations have not been issued under the statute, we assume that the statute itself requires timely opportunity to participate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the MBTA urges that we decline to consider compliance with the Massachusetts statutes under <i>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span> (1984), we do not reach the immunity question. That question is not truly jurisdictional and thus need not be addressed before the merits of the state law claim. <i>See Parella v.

The MBTA afforded public and private organizations the opportunity to comment and conducted several public meetings regarding the project. Furthermore, even assuming the plaintiffs had an individual right to participate and were \"affected by\" the project within the meaning of the statute, we agree with the district court that they were provided with sufficient opportunity to participate. The MBTA held a public meeting on July 21, 2003. Although the district court found that plaintiffs did not attend this meeting, the parties agree that they did. Plaintiff NABB also met with the MBTA twice more&#8212;once on August 5, 2003, when the design plans were 75 percent complete, and once on March 3, 2004, prior to final federal approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that the plan was essentially complete when they met with MBTA on August 5, 2003. The plan had by then reached the \"75 percent\" stage. But the record makes clear that the MBTA was still soliciting comments from the public at this stage, and final federal approval had not yet occurred. The July and August 5, 2003, meetings satisfy the statute's requirement that the participation occur early enough to \"permit comments to be considered prior to the final development of or commitment to any specific design for the project.\" Mass. Gen. Laws c. 161A, &#167; 5(k). We conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of the Massachusetts statute. Similarly, we find no merit to plaintiffs' contention that the federal regulations required earlier consultation with affected parties. <i>See</i> 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that neither the FTA nor the MBTA acted unlawfully, we conclude that the district court properly denied preliminary and final injunctive relief.
