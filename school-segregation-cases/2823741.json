Kitchen, Alamance County Attorney,\nGraham, North Carolina, for Appellees.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nLUTTIG, Circuit Judge:\n\nAppellants Ernestine and Sylvester Lewis, black voters of appellee\nAlamance County, North Carolina, challenged the County's at-large\nmethod of electing county commissioners, arguing that black citizens\nhave been denied an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their\nchoice through vote dilution, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973. The district court granted summary\njudgment for the County, holding that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate\nthat minority-preferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc\nvoting, as required by Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). For\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nI.\n\nAlamance County is governed by a Board of Commissioners, the\nfive members of which are elected, in at-large partisan elections, to\nfour-year staggered terms. Voters are allowed to cast votes for as\nmany candidates as there are vacant seats, but they cannot cast more\nthan one vote for any one candidate. Since the 1965 passage of the\nVoting Rights Act, black candidates have run for seats on the Board\nin eight of fourteen election cycles. Only one black candidate, Jack\nO'Kelley, has been elected, although he was elected three times, in\n\n                    2\n\f1974 (after first being appointed to fill a vacancy), 1976, and 1980.\nMoreover, white candidates supported by a majority (often substan-\ntial) of black voters, either in the primary election, the general elec-\ntion, or both, have repeatedly won election.1\n\nSection 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits a State or\nits political subdivisions from imposing any voting practice \"in a\nmanner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1973(a). Section 2(b) of the Act, as amended in 1982, further\nprovides that a violation of ยง 2(a) occurs,\n\n          if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the\n          political processes leading to nomination or election in the\n          State or political subdivision are not equally open to partici-\n          pation by members of a class of citizens protected by sub-\n          section (a) of this section in that its members have less\n          opportunity than other members of the electorate to partici-\n          pate in the political process and to elect representatives of\n          their choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b) (emphasis added).2\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 The census data of 1990 shows that Alamance County's population\nis 79.8% white, 19.2% black. Voting age population is 81.2% white,\n18.0% black. As of April 1994, the population of registered voters was\n84.1% white, 15.5% black. While 59% of all registered voters in the\ncounty are Democrats, blacks in Alamance County are overwhelmingly\nDemocrats (94%). For this latter reason, when we refer to primary elec-\ntions, we are referring only to the Democratic primaries.\n2 The full statute provides as follows:\n\n          (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or stan-\n          dard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any\n          State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a\n          denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United\n          States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of\n          the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as pro-\n          vided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n          (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established\n          if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the\n\n                     3\n\fIn Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), the Supreme Court\ninterpreted the amended Voting Rights Act as it applied to a challenge\nto multi-member districts in which candidates were elected at large.\nRejecting the claim that an at-large election scheme is per se violative\nof the Voting Rights Act, id. at 48, the Court established three precon-\nditions to proving that such a voting system dilutes minority group\nvoting strength sufficiently to violate the Act:\n\n          First, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that\n          it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to consti-\n          tute a majority in a single-member district. . . .\n\n          Second, the minority group must be able to show that it is\n          politically cohesive. . . .\n\n          Third, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the\n          white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .\n          usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\n\n478 U.S. at 50-51. If these preconditions are met, the court must then\ndetermine under the \"totality of circumstances\" whether there has\nbeen a violation of Section 2. See Johnson v. De Grandy, 114 S. Ct.\n2647, 2657 (1994); Collins v. City of Norfolk, Va., 816 F.2d 932, 938\n(4th Cir. 1987) (\"Collins I\") (\"[The] ultimate determination [of vote\ndilution under the Voting Rights Act] still must be made on the basis\nof the `totality of the circumstances.'\").\n\nIn an effort to meet Gingles' second and third preconditions, plain-\n_________________________________________________________________\n          political processes leading to nomination or election in the State\n          or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by\n          members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this\n          section in that its members have less opportunity than other\n          members of the electorate to participate in the political process\n          and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which\n          members of a protected class have been elected to office in the\n          State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be\n          considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a\n          right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers\n          equal to their proportion in the population.\n\n                     4\n\ftiffs' expert in this case conducted bivariate ecological regression\nanalyses on the eleven primary and general elections in which a black\ncandidate was on the ballot. Based on those regression analyses, the\nexpert estimated the level of support among black voters for each\ncandidate.3 Plaintiffs then proffered the voter preference estimates as\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 In the face of the County's intended challenge to the use of such sta-\ntistical evidence, we again caution against overreliance on bivariate eco-\nlogical regression analysis in the estimation of voter preferences for\npurposes of a vote dilution claim. See, e.g., Smith v. Brunswick County,\nVa., Bd. of Supervisors, 984 F.2d 1393, 1400 n.6 (4th Cir. 1993). Bivari-\nate regression analysis, as used in Voting Rights Act cases, only allows\none to determine the correlation between the percentage of the vote\nreceived by a particular candidate and the racial composition of voting\nprecincts. See, e.g., Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. School Dist. Bd. of\nEduc., 4 F.3d 1103, 1119 n.10 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing Richard L. Eng-\nstrom & Michael D. McDonald, Qualitative Evidence in Vote Dilution\nLitigation: Political Participation and Polarized Voting, 17 URB. LAW.\n369, 374 (Summer 1985)), cert. denied , 114 S. Ct. 2779 (1994); City of\nCarrollton Branch of the NAACP v. Stallings , 829 F.2d 1547, 1556 (11th\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 936 (1988). The relevant correlation\nfor vote dilution claims, however, is that between the race of the voters\nand the votes cast for a particular candidate, not that between the racial\ncomposition of precincts and the votes cast for a particular candidate, for\nit is only the former from which one can accurately estimate actual voter\npreferences. One can derive estimates of voter preferences from the\nregressions employed here only by assuming that the level of minority\nsupport for the candidate is fairly constant across precincts -- an \"eco-\nlogical\" assumption that runs counter to the common sense observation\nthat blacks and whites who live in integrated neighborhoods are more\nlikely to vote for candidates of another race. See, e.g., Bernard Grofman\net al., Minority Representation and the Quest for Voting Equality 89\n(1992) (\"The principal disadvantage [of ecological regression is] the pos-\nsibility of errors owing to ecological inference.\"); id. (\"[T]he `ecological\nfallacy' . . . is the error of attributing the average behavior of voters in\na given geographic area (ecological unit) to all voters in that area.\"). In\nother words, the bivariate ecological regression analysis merely assumes\nthat which it is the purpose of the analysis to prove -- political cohesive-\nness and constancy of candidate preference among minority voters and\nracial bloc voting among majority voters. See Overton v. City of Austin,\n871 F.2d 529, 539 n.12 (5th Cir. 1989) (\"[Bivariate ecological regression\nanalysis] assumes that the voters in most precincts voted according to\ntheir ethnicity.\"); id. at 539 (\"[T]rial court should not ignore the imper-\nfections of the data used nor the limitations of[bivariate ecological\nregression] analysis\").\n\n                  5\n\fproof of both black voter cohesion (the second Gingles element) and\nwhite bloc voting sufficient to usually defeat black-preferred candi-\ndates (the third Gingles element). After reviewing the voter prefer-\nence estimates from plaintiffs' expert on these selected elections, the\ndistrict court held that plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence suffi-\ncient to satisfy the third Gingles element, because they had not shown\nthat black-preferred candidates were usually defeated. Based upon the\nlimited data before the court, this conclusion was fully supported even\nby plaintiffs' own expert witness, who admitted during his deposition\nthat twenty of the thirty-one candidates \"generally preferred\" by black\nvoters in the select number of elections he analyzed won election or\nnomination, thirteen of twenty-two \"strongly preferred\" candidates\nwon election or nomination, and eleven of the seventeen \"strongest\npreferred\" candidates won election or nomination. If only the five\ngeneral elections analyzed by plaintiffs' expert are considered, eight\nof the eleven candidates most strongly preferred by black voters were\nelected to seats on the Board.\n\nPlaintiffs advance on appeal four arguments as to why the district\ncourt's conclusion was in error. We reject plaintiffs' claim that those\nwhite candidates who received overwhelming support from black vot-\ners in general elections, assertedly only because they were Democrats,\nshould not have been considered as black-preferred candidates by the\ndistrict court. And we also reject plaintiffs' argument that the district\ncourt erred in not discounting the repeated success of one of the\nminority-preferred candidates because of the alleged effects of incum-\nbency. We agree with plaintiffs, however, that the district court\nimproperly aggregated primary and general election results, and also\nthat it failed to conduct an individualized determination into whether\nsome candidates should be treated as black-preferred candidates.\nAdditionally, we conclude that the district court erred in a third\nrespect, by basing its decision exclusively on data from elections in\nwhich a black candidate was on the ballot, rather than on a more rep-\nresentative sample of elections. By limiting its consideration to elec-\ntions in which a candidate of the minority's race was on the ballot,\nthe district court may have failed to include as black-preferred candi-\ndates some white candidates who may very well have been the repre-\nsentatives of choice of the black community.\n\n                     6\n\fII.\n\nTurning first to what we perceive to be the overarching error, we\nbelieve that, by considering only elections in which a black candidate\nwas on the ballot, the district court failed to analyze a sufficient num-\nber of elections to enable it to determine whether white bloc voting\nusually operates to defeat minority-preferred candidates. As noted, the\ndistrict court considered only election data from eleven of the twenty-\neight primary and general elections held since passage of the Voting\nRights Act -- six of fourteen primary elections and only five of four-\nteen general elections. Although we recognize that this election data\nwas the only data proffered by plaintiffs, we believe that, without a\nlarger, more representative sample of elections, the district court sim-\nply did not have before it sufficient evidence to determine whether the\nblack-preferred candidates usually were defeated,4 unless one is will-\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 We do not imply that the third Gingles element is met if plaintiffs\nmerely show that white bloc voting defeats the minority-preferred candi-\ndate more often than not. The terms used by the Gingles Court are \"usu-\nally,\" \"normally,\" and \"generally.\" 478 U.S. at 49, 51, 56. We need not\nin this case specify a meaning for these terms; suffice it to say that they\nmean something more than just 51%. See Clarke v. City of Cincinnati,\n40 F.3d 807, 812-13 (6th Cir. 1994) (finding that 47% success rate was\n\"no reason to find that blacks' preferred black candidates have `usually'\nbeen defeated.\"), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1960 (1995); Uno v. City of\nHolyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 985 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[T]o be legally significant,\nracially polarized voting in a specific community must be such that, over\na period of years, whites vote sufficiently as a bloc to defeat minority\n[-preferred] candidates most of the time .\" (emphasis added)). Indeed, Jus-\ntice O'Connor suggested in Gingles that a finding of \"usually defeated\"\nshould be based on a success rate by minority-preferred candidates that\nis less than proportional representation, although greater than mere\ntokenism. 478 U.S. at 99-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\"[A] reviewing court should be required to find more than simply that\nthe minority group does not usually attain an undiluted [that is, propor-\ntional] measure of electoral success. The court must find that even sub-\nstantial [that is, less than proportional but more than token] minority\nsuccess will be highly infrequent under the challenged plan before it may\nconclude, on this basis alone, that the plan operates `to cancel out or min-\nimize the voting strength of [the] racial grou[p].'\" (quoting White v.\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755, 765 (1973))); see also Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1122\n(\"If minority-preferred candidates are consistently able to prevail in rep-\nresentative numbers . . . , then it cannot be said that white voters vote\nsufficiently as a bloc usually to prevent the election of the minority pre-\nferred candidates.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n                  7\n\fing to assume (which we are not) that the black community will never\nhave a preferred candidate in an election in which no black candidate\nis on the ballot, or, more fundamentally, that a black voter can never\nprefer a candidate who is white.\n\nAlthough the district court erred in this regard, we do not reverse\nits judgment because of this error, for it is the plaintiffs' burden to\nestablish a violation of Section 2, and therefore their burden to proffer\ndata from a sufficient number of elections to enable the district court\nto determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats minority-\npreferred candidates. Where, as here, plaintiffs fail to carry their bur-\nden to proffer sufficient evidence, and the district court correctly con-\ncludes on the basis of the proffered evidence that no Section 2\nviolation has been established, then the plaintiffs cannot be heard to\ncomplain.\n\nA.\n\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the use of voting pro-\ncedures, such as at-large elections, that afford minority voters less\nopportunity than other members of the electorate\"to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice,\" 42 U.S.C.ยง 1973(b) (emphasis\nadded), or, in the language of Gingles, that afford minority voters less\nopportunity to elect minority-preferred candidates. Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 51. The only possible interpretation of this unambiguous language\nis that Section 2 prohibits any election procedure which operates to\ndeny to minorities an equal opportunity to elect those candidates\nwhom they prefer, whether or not those candidates are themselves of\nthe minority race. As Justice Brennan observed in Gingles, \"it is the\nstatus of the candidate as the chosen representative of a particular\nracial group, not the race of the candidate,\" which is relevant in\ndetermining whether Gingles' third precondition is satisfied. Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 68 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J., joined by Blackmun,\nMarshall, and Stevens, JJ.); see Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937 n.5 (\"The\nquestion is not . . . so simple as how many blacks versus whites were\nelected. The court must examine the parties' studies of voting prefer-\nences to determine which were the preferred candidates of the major-\nity and minority communities.\"); see also Lani Guinier, The Triumph\nof Tokenism: The Voting Rights Act and the Theory of Black Electoral\nSuccess, 89 MICH. L. REV. 1077, 1103 n.115 (1991) (\"Authentic repre-\n\n                     8\n\fsentatives [of the black community] need not be black as long as the\nsource of their authority, legitimacy, and power base is the black\ncommunity.\"). That is, a minority-preferred candidate may be a non-\nminority, just as a minority candidate may be the preferred candidate\nof the voters of the majority's race. The black community may prefer\na white candidate, as the white community may prefer a black candi-\ndate. A Martin Luther King, Jr. or a Colin Powell can represent white\nAmericans, no less than a John Fitzgerald Kennedy or a Hubert Hum-\nphrey can represent black Americans. To indulge the contrary pre-\nsumption, that every black person necessarily prefers a black\ncandidate over a white candidate, or that every white person necessar-\nily prefers a white candidate over a black candidate, would itself con-\nstitute invidious discrimination of the kind that the Voting Rights Act\nwas enacted to eradicate, effectively disenfranchising every minority\ncitizen who casts his or her vote for a non-minority candidate. To\nacquiesce in such a presumption would be not merely to resign our-\nselves to, but to place the imprimatur of law behind, a segregated\npolitical system -- in Judge Cabranes' words, an\"electoral apart-\nheid,\" NAACP v. City of Niagara Falls, N.Y., 65 F.3d 1002, 1016 (2d\nCir. 1995) -- in derogation of the most fundamental principles of our\nrepresentative democracy and in betrayal of our most cherished\nbeliefs about individual autonomy and political self-determination.\n\nOur understanding of Section 2 that the minority-preferred candi-\ndate may be either a minority or a non-minority, and therefore that\nboth elections in which the candidates are of the same race and elec-\ntions in which the candidates are of different races must be considered\nin order to determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats the\nminority-preferred candidate, is confirmed within Section 2 itself, by\nthe express proviso that \"[t]he extent to which members of a protected\nclass have been elected to office\" is but \"one circumstance which may\nbe considered\" in assessing whether minority voters have been denied\nan equal opportunity \"to participate in the political process and to\nelect representatives of their choice.\" See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b); see\nalso id. (\"[N]othing in this section establishes a right to have mem-\nbers of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion\nin the population.\"). Were this proviso, coupled with the statute's\nplain reference to the minority's representatives\"of choice,\" not\nenough, the plurality in Gingles itself, as noted, expressly stated that\n\"only the race of the voter, not the race of the candidate, is relevant\"\n\n                    9\n\fin determining whether a plaintiff has met Gingles' preconditions,\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 68 (emphasis added), and not a single Justice\nsuggested that only candidates of the minority race could be consid-\nered minority-preferred candidates, see infra note 5. Indeed, as the\nThird Circuit has held, a candidate of the minority's race need not\neven be the minority-preferred candidate. Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol.\nSchool Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1126 (3d Cir. 1993), cert.\ndenied, 114 S. Ct. 2779 (1994).\n\nAlthough at times they suggest otherwise, see Appellant's Br. at 30\n(\"Under the law, black voters must have an opportunity not just to\nelect candidates of their choice, but to elect black candidates of their\nchoice\"), plaintiffs no doubt agree with our interpretation of Section\n2. They themselves conducted a bivariate regression analysis on the\neleven elections in which a black candidate was on the ballot pre-\ncisely in order to determine whether the black candidate or the white\ncandidate was the minority-preferred candidate in those elections.\nHad they not believed, as we do, that a white candidate may be the\nminority-preferred candidate, then they would have advanced their\nclaim solely on the basis that only one black candidate had actually\nwon in these elections. To conduct a regression analysis with respect\nto a black-white election, ostensibly in part to identify the black-\npreferred candidate, makes sense only if it is possible for the preferred\ncandidate not to be the black candidate.\n\nWe recognize that the plaintiffs' expert in Gingles had only ana-\nlyzed elections in which a black candidate had appeared on the ballot,\nsee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 52, and that the Court there relied upon that\ndata in invalidating North Carolina's at-large election scheme. The\nCourt in Gingles, however, never addressed the question of whether\nplaintiffs' exclusion of evidence from white-white races rendered\ntheir proffer insufficient; it merely assumed for purposes of that case\nthat the black candidates there were the representatives of choice of\nblack voters. Justice Brennan, in fact, could not have been clearer in\nthis regard:\n\n          Because both minority and majority voters often select\n          members of their own race as their preferred representatives,\n          it will frequently be the case that a black candidate is the\n          choice of blacks, while a white candidate is the choice of\n\n                     10\n\f          whites. . . . Indeed, the facts of this case illustrate that ten-\n          dency -- blacks preferred black candidates, whites preferred\n          white candidates. Thus, as a matter of convenience, we and\n          the District Court may refer to the preferred representative\n          of black voters as the \"black candidate\" and to the preferred\n          representative of white voters as the \"white candidate.\"\n          Nonetheless, the fact that race of voter and race of candi-\n          date is often correlated is not directly pertinent to a ยง 2\n          inquiry. Under ยง 2, it is the status of the candidate as the\n          chosen representative of a particular racial group, not the\n          race of the candidate, that is important.\n\nId. at 68 (emphasis added, in part) (plurality opinion);5 cf. Harvell v.\nBlytheville School District No. 5, 71 F.3d 1382, 1386 (8th Cir. 1995)\n(en banc) (\"We do not categorically state that a candidate is the\nminority-preferred candidate simply because that candidate is a mem-\nber of the minority.

Only by considering such a representative sample can the\ndistrict court meaningfully determine whether a white voting bloc\nusually defeats the minority-preferred candidate. See, e.g., Uno v.\nCity of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 985 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[T]o be legally\nsignificant, racially polarized voting in a specific community must be\nsuch that, over a period of years, whites vote sufficiently as a bloc to\ndefeat minority[-preferred]6 candidates most of the time. . . .

Supp. at 1316,8 to our knowledge, no court has held that a\nwhite candidate cannot, as a matter of law, be a minority-preferred\ncandidate, and therefore that white-white elections are irrelevant to\nthe Gingles third element inquiry.\n\nB.\n\nBy failing to consider evidence of elections in which no minority\ncandidate appeared on the ballot, the district court, insofar as can be\ndiscerned, could have understated (or overstated) the extent to which\nminority-preferred candidates were usually defeated in Alamance\nCounty.\n\nFor example, the record includes election data from the 1974 gen-\neral election because O'Kelley, a black candidate, was on the ballot\nseeking election to the unexpired term of the seat to which he had\nbeen appointed following a vacancy. But it does not include election\ndata from the 1974 primary election, notwithstanding that the two\nDemocrats elected in the primary for the two full-term seats, both of\nwhom were white, each received 99+% of the black vote in the gen-\neral election. Although it may well be that either or both of these can-\ndidates were the minority-preferred candidates in the 1974 primary,\nand therefore would have counted as minority-preferred electoral suc-\ncesses (both did receive a majority of black support in other primary\n_________________________________________________________________\n8 We do not decide here the extent to which, if any, white-white elec-\ntions are deserving of less evidentiary weight than elections in which a\nminority candidate is on the ballot. It seems to us, however, that if white-\nwhite elections are entitled to less weight, then they are so only on the\nquestion of whether racial polarization exists, not on the question of\nwhether, because of that polarization, minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated. Cf. Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1382 (distinguishing between\n\"racial cohesiveness,\" the second Gingles precondition, and \"racial polar-\nization, . . . the essential element of the third Gingles precondition,\" and\nholding that in measuring whether racial polarization \"permits the major-\nity usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidates,\" evidence such\nas \"elections in which there was no African-American candidate [on the\nballot] . . . become[s] relevant.\").\n\n                    15\n\felections -- Long received 84% in 1972, and Newlin 60%, in 1978),\nit could be that neither was a minority-preferred candidate in the 1974\nprimary, in which case there were uncounted minority-preferred\ndefeats.\n\nSimilarly, the record does not include election results from the\n1972 or 1978 general elections, although Long was successful in the\n1972 primary with 84% of the black vote (second only to the 98%\nreceived by Morris, a black candidate), and Newlin was successful in\nthe 1978 primary with 60% of the black vote (second only to the 78%\nreceived by black candidate Harris). Based upon the record data from\nother general elections, it may be that both of these candidates\nreceived near unanimous support of the black community in their gen-\neral elections, and thus should have been considered the black-\npreferred candidates in those elections. But, without the data from\nthese elections, it simply cannot be known whether they, or others,\nwere the black-preferred candidates, and therefore whether the black-\npreferred candidates were successful or defeated.\n\nAnd there are no election returns, general or primary, for the 1966,\n1968, 1970, 1982, 1988, or 1990 election cycles. The district court\ntherefore likewise could not have known who were the representa-\ntives of choice of black voters in those elections, or whether or not\nthey were defeated.\n\nIn making these observations, we do not suggest that the district\ncourt need analyze every election since 1965 in order to determine\nwhether the minority-preferred candidates are usually defeated. We\nleave to another day the question of precisely how many elections\nmust be considered in order for a district court's conclusions to be\nadequately supported. Cf. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (\"[A] pattern of\nracial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative\nof . . . legally significant polarization than are the results of a single\nelection.\"); Hines v.

Specifically, plaintiffs urge: 1) that the\ndistrict court improperly viewed as minority-preferred candidates\nsome candidates who finished second and third among black voters;\n2) that it improperly treated candidates in the general election as\nblack-preferred when those candidates assertedly received a majority\nof black votes only because they were Democrats; 3) that it improp-\nerly viewed success in the primary election as electoral success; and\n4) that it failed to discount the weight attributed to the one repeatedly\nsuccessful black candidate due to the effects of incumbency. We\naddress each of these challenges in turn, finding no reversible error\nby the district court.\n\nA.\n\nPlaintiffs first contend that, contrary to our holding in Collins v.\nCity of Norfolk, Va., 883 F.2d 1232 (4th Cir. 1989) (\"Collins II\"),cert.\ndenied, 498 U.S. 938 (1990), the district court considered as \"black-\npreferred\" some successful candidates who finished second and third\namong black voters, behind a successful black-preferred candidate.\nWe agree that the district court erred, but not in the manner plaintiffs\nsuggest. Rather, we conclude the district court erred in plaintiffs'\nfavor by not treating as \"black-preferred\" some successful candidates\nwho placed second or third among black voters (and with a significant\n\n                     17\n\fmajority of black votes) behind an unsuccessful candidate who was\nthe first choice of black voters.\n\n1.\n\nBecause Alamance County's Board of Commissioners is elected\nfrom a single, multi-member district, citizens are permitted to vote for\neither two or three candidates in both the primary and general elec-\ntions, depending on the number of seats up for election in any given\nyear. Consequently, the district court in most cases treated the top two\nor three vote-recipients among black voters as the black-preferred\ncandidates, as did plaintiffs' expert. If the first choice of black voters\ndid not win an election, however, the district court excluded from\nconsideration even as possible minority-preferred candidates those\ncandidates who placed second or third among black voters behind the\nlosing black-preferred candidate, in attempted reliance on our opinion\nin Collins II, 883 F.2d at 1238. In so doing, the district court, as even\ncounsel for the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument, seems to have\nmisread our opinion in Collins II. We did not, in Collins II, adopt a\nper se rule against considering, as minority-preferred, candidates who\nfinished second or third among minority voters behind an unsuccess-\nful candidate who was the minority community's first choice. We\nheld only that,\n\n          [t]he mere election of a candidate who appears to have\n          received votes from more than fifty percent of minority bal-\n          lots does not count as a minority electoral success, when\n          each ballot may contain votes for more than one candidate.\n          In such a situation, if there were other candidates, preferred\n          by a significantly higher percentage of the minority commu-\n          nity, who were defeated in the same election, then it cannot\n          be fairly said that the minority community has successfully\n          elected representatives of its choice. Each such situation\n          must be reviewed individually to determine whether the\n          elected candidates can be fairly considered as representa-\n          tives of the minority community. The presumption must be\n          that they cannot if some other candidate has received\n          significantly more minority votes.\n\nId. at 1238 (emphases added) (quoting Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937).\n\n                     18\n\fCollins II, in other words, requires that a two-step inquiry be\nundertaken by the court in order to determine whether candidates who\nreceive less support from black voters than an unsuccessful first\nchoice may nevertheless be deemed black-preferred candidates in\nmulti-seat elections. First, if the unsuccessful candidate who was the\nfirst choice among minority voters did not receive a\"significantly\nhigher percentage\" of the minority community's support than did\nother candidates who also received a majority among minority voters,\nCollins II, 883 F.2d at 1238 (quoting Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937); see\nalso id. at 1239 (referring to the level of support given to the unsuc-\ncessful candidate as \"much greater\"), then the latter should also be\nviewed by the district court as minority-preferred candidates. Cf.\nNiagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1018 (treating as black-preferred a candi-\ndate who finished behind an unsuccessful first choice among black\nvoters whose support \"was not dramatically higher.\"). Second, if the\nlevel of support received by the unsuccessful first-place finisher\namong black voters was \"significantly higher\" than the support given\nthe second- and third-place finishers by those same voters, then suc-\ncessful candidates who finished behind the unsuccessful first choice\n\"are presumed not to be the minority's preferred candidates or repre-\nsentatives of choice.\" Id. at 1238. Even so, the district court must still\nreview \"[e]ach such situation . . . individually to determine whether\nthe elected candidates can be fairly considered as representatives of\nthe minority community.\" Id. This is to say that Collins II requires an\nindividualized determination in the circumstance where the unsuc-\ncessful first choice of black voters received significantly more support\nthan the next-place finishers of the black voters. In this circumstance,\nthe individualized determination is undertaken in order to ensure that\nthe second- or third-place finishers, who, based upon their substantial\nsupport from the minority community would seem to be minority-\npreferred candidates, may in fact fairly be characterized as such.\n\nIn this case, black candidate Morris, for example, received 98% of\nthe black vote in the 1972 Democratic primary election, and white\ncandidates Long, Fleming, and Horne received 84%, 29%, and 16%\nof the black vote, respectively.9 Long, Fleming, and Horne won the\nprimary election. Notwithstanding the impressive support that Long\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Three other white candidates received 9%, 8% and 5% of the black\nvote, respectively.\n\n                     19\n\freceived from black voters in the primary, the district court did not\neven consider whether Long might have been a black-preferred candi-\ndate. Because Morris' support among black voters was not \"signifi-\ncantly higher\" than Long's, the district court appears to have erred in\nnot automatically treating Long as a black-preferred candidate. But\neven had Morris' level of support among black voters been signifi-\ncantly higher than Long's, the district court still would have erred in\nnot making an individualized determination before rejecting Long as\na black-preferred candidate.\n\nMorris' support was significantly higher than the 29% received by\nFleming. In such a circumstance, as in the case directly addressed by\nCollins II,10 a presumption against viewing Fleming as black-\npreferred is required by our holding in Collins II, which, as a panel,\nwe are bound by. However, the district court should have made an\nindividualized determination to assess whether that candidate, too,\ncould properly have been deemed black-preferred.\n\nThe district court also declined to treat successful white candidate\nNewlin as a black-preferred candidate in the 1978 Democratic pri-\nmary, merely because Harris, the first choice of black voters, lost.\nThere were two seats up for election that year, and Harris and Newlin\nwere the top two vote-recipients among black voters, by far, with an\nestimated 78% and 60% of the black vote, respectively. Significantly,\nthe third place finisher among black voters was a black candidate,\nwho received only 12% of the black vote. Even were we to conclude\nthat Harris' support among black voters was \"significantly higher\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n10 Our holding in Collins II actually does not address this circumstance\ndirectly, since Fleming received less than majority support among black\nvoters; Collins II addressed only the circumstance where a candidate\nreceives more than 50% of the minority community's vote. Nevertheless,\nwe do not believe that the mere failure to achieve a threshold of 50% in\na multi-candidate election necessarily means that a candidate cannot be\nviewed as a black-preferred candidate. If the election had been held only\namong black voters, a hypothetical inquiry given some credence by the\nGingles plurality, see 478 U.S. at 68 (\"The essence of a submergence\nclaim is that minority group members prefer certain candidates whom\nthey could elect\" if the election were held in a majority-black district),\nthen Fleming would have won, because he was the third-place finisher\namong black voters in an election in which three seats were to be filled.\n\n                    20\n\fthan Newlin's, an individualized determination would still have been\nrequired before declining to treat Newlin as a black-preferred candi-\ndate. Again, we held in Collins II only that successful candidates who\nreceive more than 50% of the black vote should not automatically be\nviewed as a black-preferred candidate if they receive significantly less\nsupport from black voters than another, losing candidate, not that they\nshould never be treated as black-preferred.\n\n2.\n\nWhile the district court erred in automatically excluding, as possi-\nble minority-preferred candidates, the second- and third-place finish-\ners behind an unsuccessful first choice among black voters, we do not\nbelieve the court erred, as plaintiffs contend, in not conducting an\nindividualized determination with respect to every candidate who fin-\nished second or third among black voters behind successful black-\npreferred candidates, before treating them as black-preferred. Plain-\ntiffs object to the fact that the district court considered some of the\nsecond and/or third place finishers as black-preferred in the three pri-\nmary elections in which the first choice of black voters was successful\n-- 1976, 1980, and 1984. In the 1976 primary, for example, the dis-\ntrict court treated both successful black candidate O'Kelley, who won\n99+% of the black vote, and successful white candidate Fleming, who\nfinished second among black voters with 47% of the vote, as black-\npreferred. The district court did not, however, consider successful\nwhite candidate Paris as black-preferred because he received only\n16% of the black vote, even though that percentage placed him in a\ntie for third among black voters and thus may have been sufficient to\nwin had the election been held only among black voters. See supra\nnote 10. All three candidates went on to win in the general election,\nwith 99+% of the black community's vote.\n\nPlaintiffs object to the district court's treatment of these second and\nthird place finishers as black-preferred candidates on the ground that,\n\"[i]n most of these elections, . . . the black community fielded only\none [black] candidate,\" Appellant's Br. at 20. In advancing this argu-\nment, plaintiffs rely not on the holding in Collins II, but on a single\npassage from that case in which we said the following:\n\n          If black voters exercised their right to cast all of their allot-\n          ted votes, they ran the risk that their second and third\n\n                     21\n\f          choices would be declared their preferred candidates. Only\n          by single-shot voting -- withholding all votes save for their\n          first choice, and forfeiting the opportunity to cast all votes\n          allotted to each voter -- could the minority be assured that\n          its second and third choices would not be declared its pre-\n          ferred candidates. In contrast, under the at-large system, the\n          white voters can freely cast all votes allotted to them with-\n          out suffering the penalty imposed on the minority voters.\n\n883 F.2d at 1239-40. Because Collins II, as explained above,\naddressed only the treatment of second- and third-place finishers\nbehind an unsuccessful, not a successful, minority-preferred candi-\ndate, this passage is obviously dictum and not controlling here. And\neven were it applicable, the passage does not suggest the level of sup-\nport necessary in order for such candidates to be considered minority-\npreferred.\n\nWe believe that it would be unwise to extend the holding in Collins II\nto instances in which the first choice among black voters was success-\nful. Where the first choice of black voters was successful, there is\nsimply no reason to presume that the minority community has been\nunsuccessful in electing representatives of its choice. Accordingly, we\nnow hold that, in multi-seat elections in which voters are permitted\nto cast as many votes as there are seats, at the very least any candidate\nwho receives a majority of the minority vote and who finishes behind\na successful candidate who was the first choice among the minority\nvoters is automatically to be deemed a black-preferred candidate, just\nlike the successful first choice. Cf. Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1018\nn.18 (noting that parties did not dispute that candidates who received\nmore than 50% were black-preferred). Candidates who receive less\nthan 50% of the minority vote, but who would have been elected had\nthe election been held only among black voters, are presumed also to\nbe minority-preferred candidates, although an individualized assess-\nment should be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may\nappropriately be so considered.\n\nThe district court appears generally to have conducted its analysis\nin the manner that we have described as appropriate. It considered as\nblack-preferred candidates only those candidates who received sub-\n\n                     22\n\fstantial support from black voters;11 it did not unquestioningly denom-\ninate as black-preferred the top two or three vote-recipients among the\nblack community. Moreover, the court seems to have made an indi-\nvidualized determination before considering, as black-preferred, can-\ndidates such as Fleming who, in 1976, received slightly less than 50%\nof the black vote (47%), and in rejecting Paris, who in that same elec-\ntion only tied for third, with 16% of the black vote. We accordingly\ndiscern no reason to disturb the district court's determinations with\nrespect to those candidates who finished second and third among\nminority voters, behind the minority community's successful first\nchoice. Those determinations are not clearly erroneous. See Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 77-79.\n\nB.\n\nPlaintiffs next object to the fact that the district court treated, as\nblack-preferred, Democratic candidates who received 99+% of the\nblack vote in general elections. Plaintiffs contend that to consider\nthese candidates as black-preferred ignores that blacks in Alamance\nCounty overwhelmingly support Democrats in partisan elections.\nThey argue that Democrats should be treated as black-preferred only\nif they were also black-preferred in the primary election. Therefore,\nthey would have us discount, for example, the general election victo-\nries of Fleming in 1976 and Paris in 1980, both of whom received\nnearly unanimous black voter support, merely because they received\n\"only\" 47% and 48%, respectively, of the black vote in the primary\nelections. This argument is flawed in two fundamental respects.\n\nFirst, as we discuss infra, acceptance of this argument would\nrequire that we carry forward the candidates' black-preferred status\nfrom the primary to the general election, when the Voting Rights Act\nis clearly concerned with whether blacks have an equal opportunity\nto elect the candidate of their choice in both nominations and elec-\ntions. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b) (\"A violation . . . is established if . . .\nit is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\nelection . . . are not equally open to participation by [citizens on\n_________________________________________________________________\n11 The level of support that may properly be deemed \"substantial\" will\nvary, of course, depending on the number of candidates on the ballot and\nthe number of seats to be filled.\n\n                    23\n\faccount of race or color].\" (emphasis added)); cf. NAACP v. City of\nColumbia, S.C., 850 F. Supp. 404, 417 (D. S.C. 1993) (noting, as\nironic, the fact that second choice of black voters, behind unsuccess-\nful first choice, who went on to prevail in run-off election with major-\nity of support from black voters, would not be considered preferred\nby either blacks or whites if level of support received in the initial pri-\nmary election was the benchmark), aff 'd as modified on other\ngrounds, 33 F.3d 52 (4th Cir. 1994) (per curiam), cert. denied, 115\nS. Ct. 1095 (1995). Thus, candidates who receive 99+% of the black\nvote in general elections are the black-preferred candidate in that\nelection, regardless of their level of support in the primary. We reject\nthe proposition that \"success of a minority-preferred candidate in a\ngeneral election is entitled to less weight when a candidate with far\ngreater [minority] support was defeated in the primary.\" Niagara\nFalls, 65 F.3d at 1018. Such a view is grounded in the belief that\nminority voters essentially take their marbles and go home whenever\nthe candidate whom they prefer most in the primary does not prevail,\na belief about minority voters that we do not share. And such a view\nignores altogether the possibility that primary election winners will\nbecome the minority's preferred candidate during the general election\ncampaign, or that where, as here, the overwhelming majority of\nblacks vote in the Democratic primary, that a Republican could in fact\nbecome the black-preferred candidate in the general election by\naddressing himself to issues of interest to the minority community in\na way that appeals to them as participants in the political process.\n\nSecond, under plaintiffs' theory, the district court would be\nrequired, contrary to Gingles, to assess the cause of the minority com-\nmunity's support of the candidate in determining whether the\nminority-preferred candidates usually are defeated by white bloc vot-\ning. See infra note 12. In Gingles, defendants argued that the plaintiffs\nwere required to use multiple regression analysis, rather than bivariate\nregression analysis, to ensure that only those defeats of black-\npreferred candidates that were actually caused by race, and not some\nother reason such as party affiliation, were considered defeats of\nblack-preferred candidates for purposes of a vote dilution claim. The\nGingles plurality explicitly rejected such a requirement in the context\n\n                     24\n\fof assessing the second and third Gingles preconditions. 478 U.S. at\n62.12\n\nMoreover, even the limited election data in this record demonstrate\nthat black voters do not vote monolithically, even in partisan general\nelections. White Democrats Holt and Thompson only received 69%\nand 83% of the black vote, respectively, in the 1984 general election,\nand Democrat Morris, who is black, received only 57% of the black\nvote in the 1986 general election -- behind Democrat Bennett, who\nis white, who received 99+% of the black vote.\n_________________________________________________________________\n12 Although only a four-Member plurality joined Section III(C) of the\nopinion, in which the rejection of defendant's multiple regression claim\nis found, Section III(C) is lengthy, and the dispute that cost Justice\nWhite's vote on the section was not over the \"cause\" issue.\n\nAlthough most of our sister circuits have by now adopted the position\nthat an inquiry into cause is relevant, see, e.g., LULAC, 999 F.2d at 850\n(\"[The] rigorous protections [of the Voting Rights Act], as the text of ยง 2\nsuggests, extend only to defeats experienced by voters `on account of\nrace or color.'\"), they are still in disagreement about the stage in the vote\ndilution inquiry in which causation evidence is appropriate, compare\nNipper, 39 F.3d at 1515 (\"[I]f the evidence shows, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, that the community is not motivated by racial bias in\nits voting patterns, then a case of vote dilution has not been made.\") with\nClarke, 40 F.3d at 812-14 (considering \"cause\" of the success rate of\nblack-preferred candidates in assessing third Gingles element). We think\nthe best reading of the several opinions in Gingles, however, is one that\ntreats causation as irrelevant in the inquiry into the three Gingles precon-\nditions, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 62 (Brennan, J., plurality opinion), but\nrelevant in the totality of circumstances inquiry, see 478 U.S. at 100\n(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (agreeing that use of racial polar-\nization data \"solely\" to prove Gingles second and third elements cannot\nbe rebutted by \"evidence that the divergent racial voting patterns may be\nexplained in part by causes other than race,\" but disagreeing with plurali-\nty's claim \"that such evidence can never affect the overall vote dilution\ninquiry.\").\n\nOf course, whether causation is relevant to the second and third pre-\ncondition inquiries or to the totality of circumstances inquiry, it would\nbe just as relevant for determining whether particular minority-preferred\ncandidates lose for some reason other than racial polarization, as it would\nbe for determining, as plaintiffs urge, whether particular minority-\npreferred candidates win merely because of party affiliation.\n\n                     25\n\fWe therefore hold that the district court properly deemed all gen-\neral election candidates who received 99+% of the black community's\nvote as black-preferred, without reference to the underlying primary\nelection.\n\nC.\n\nPlaintiffs next contend that the district court erred in not distin-\nguishing between, and separately analyzing, primaries and general\nelections, in determining whether black-preferred candidates were\n\"usually\" successful. With this contention, we agree.\n\nSection 2(b) of the Voting Rights Act provides that a violation\noccurs if \"the political processes leading to nomination or election . . .\nare not equally open\" to all voters. 42 U.S.C.ยง 1973(b) (emphasis\nadded); see also 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973l(c)(1) (\"The terms `vote' or `vot-\ning' shall include all action necessary to make a vote effective in any\nprimary, special, or general election . . . .\"). The statute thus requires\nthat minorities have an equal opportunity to participate not only in\nprimary elections but also in general elections. From this, we believe\nit follows that the results in these two phases of the single election\ncycle must be separately considered and analyzed, and, in recognition\nof this statutory requirement, that Gingles' third precondition can be\nsatisfied by proof that, in either the primary or the general election,\nthe minority-preferred candidate is usually defeated by white bloc\nvoting. Not to separately consider primary and general elections risks\nmasking regular defeat in one of these phases with repeated successes\nin the other, and thereby misperceiving a process that is palpably in\nviolation of the Voting Rights Act, as not violative of the Act at all.\n\nBy way of illustration, an at-large voting method under which the\ncandidates preferred by the minority community are always success-\nful in the primary election but, because of white bloc voting, are\nalways defeated in the general election (or one in which minority-\npreferred candidates are essentially barred from the general election\nballot because of racial-bloc voting in the primary, see White v.\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755, 767 (1973) (\"[T]he black community has\nbeen effectively excluded from participation in the Democratic pri-\nmary selection process.\")), is a voting method under which minorities\nare, because of white bloc voting, always unsuccessful in attaining\n\n                     26\n\felective office. By aggregating primary and general elections, how-\never, a court would ineluctably find in both circumstances that\nminority-preferred candidates were successful fifty percent of the\ntime, and therefore not \"usually\" defeated by white bloc voting.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held, in an analogous context, that courts\nmust not rely on \"aggregated\" data \"when considering several sepa-\nrate vote dilution challenges in a single case.\" See Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 59 n.28; see also id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\"The District Court clearly erred in aggregating data from all of the\nchallenged districts . . . .\"). Because plaintiffs' challenge is, in reality,\ntwo separate vote dilution challenges -- one to the at-large primary\nelection scheme, and one to the at-large general election scheme --\nwe believe that like reasoning must obtain here. Accordingly, we hold\nthat primary and general election results should not be aggregated for\npurposes of determining whether black-preferred candidates are \"usu-\nally\" successful, and that the district court erred in so doing. Because\nplaintiffs in this case would not prevail on their Section 2 claim even\nwere the primaries and general elections considered separately, how-\never, we will not reverse the district court on account of this error.\n\nD.\n\nPlaintiffs' final claim is that the district court erred in not discount-\ning the weight attributed to O'Kelley's electoral successes because he\nwas an incumbent. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (\"[S]pecial circum-\nstances, such as the absence of an opponent, incumbency, or the utili-\nzation of bullet voting, may explain minority electoral success in a\npolarized contest.\" (emphasis added)); but see Smith, 687 F. Supp. at\n1317 (\"The materiality of [evidence of incumbency] is questionable.\"\n(citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 63 (plurality opinion))). O'Kelley, one of\nthe successful black-preferred candidates whom the district court con-\nsidered in determining whether black-preferred candidates usually\nwere defeated, won three straight general elections (and, apparently,\n5 elections total, including primaries) after first being appointed to a\nvacant seat. Although the district court provided no explanation of its\ndecision not to discount O'Kelley's successes, we will not disturb that\ndecision, given that plaintiffs' own expert did not analyze the effects\nof incumbency for O'Kelley or for any other candidate. To reverse as\nclearly erroneous the district court's decision under these circum-\n\n                      27\n\fstances would be to transform what was at most a narrow or \"special\"\ncircumstance envisioned by the Court only in dicta into a categorical\nrule that all electoral successes of a minority-preferred incumbent are\nto be discounted. See, e.g., Clarke, 40 F.3d at 813-14 (\"[I]ncumbency\nplays a significant role in the vast majority of American elections. To\nqualify as a `special' circumstance, then, incumbency must play an\nunusually important role in the election at issue; a contrary rule would\nconfuse the ordinary with the special, and thus`make practically\nevery American election a \"special circumstance.\"'\" (quoting Collins\nII, 883 F.2d at 1250 (Chapman, J., dissenting)). Of course, as the\ndefendants point out, and as counsel for the plaintiffs conceded at\nargument, \"if incumbency were to be considered to discount the\nweight to be given to the success of one black candidate, O'Kelley,\nit likewise would have to be used to discount the weight given to the\ndefeat of other black candidates who lost to incumbents, such as Har-\nris in 1978 and Freeman in 1984.\" Appellee's Br. at 24, citing Nipper\nv. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1538-39 (11th Cir. 1994)).\n\n*****\n\nThe purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to ensure to minority citi-\nzens an equal opportunity to participate in the democratic processes\nand to elect candidates of their choice, candidates whom they believe\nwill best represent their political interests. The Act's purpose is not\nto ensure the election of candidates of the minority's race, nor is it to\nensure the election of candidates of any particular political party. In\nguaranteeing that minorities will be afforded an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in the political processes and to elect representatives of\n\"their choice,\" the Act at once embodies the presumption and\nembraces the ideal that, in this Country, a candidate of any color can\nrepresent citizens of all colors, that a candidate of either party can\nrepresent the interests of all parties. Few presumptions are more fun-\ndamental to our system of representative democracy or more reveal-\ning of our commitment to equality and individual autonomy.\n\nAt bottom, through their collective arguments, plaintiffs urge a\nreading of the Supreme Court's decision in Gingles, and therefore an\ninterpretation of Section 2, that would be \"at war\" with this funda-\nmental presumption, this ideal, which we believe not only informed\nCongress' enactment of Section 2, but underlay the Court's interpreta-\n\n                     28\n\ftion of that provision in Gingles. The reading of Gingles urged upon\nus would not simply guarantee to minority voters an equal opportu-\nnity to elect representatives of their choice, but would require the\nelection of minority candidates: \"Under the law, black voters must\nhave an opportunity not just to elect candidates of their choice, but to\nelect black candidates of their choice.\" Appellant's Br. at 30. Such an\ninterpretation, of course, is grounded ultimately in the twin presump-\ntions that all members of a particular racial group will always prefer\nthe same candidate and that that preferred candidate will always be\nof that group's race. We simply disagree that Gingles requires, or\neven permits, any such presumptions; indeed, we believe Gingles for-\nbids such presumptions based upon race alone. And to the extent it\ncan be read otherwise, we are convinced the Court would not so read\nthe case today, given its unequivocal pronouncements that the princi-\nples of equal protection are offended by \"assumption[s] that voters of\na particular race, because of their race, `think alike, share the same\npolitical interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls'.\"\nMiller v.

I write separately, how-\never, to express my concern about the way in which my dissenting\ncolleague interprets Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). That\ncase commands us, when analyzing claims of minority vote dilution,\nto determine whether \"the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc\nto enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\nId. at 51.\n\nThe dissent's intensely race-conscious approach to that inquiry\nseems to me at odds with three recent Supreme Court cases which\nhave held race-based redistricting schemes to be in violation of the\nConstitution. See Bush v. Vera, 116 S.Ct. 1941 (1996); Shaw v. Hunt,\n116 S.Ct. 1894 (1996); Miller v. Johnson, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (1995).\nGingles may require us to engage in an inquiry which focuses on\nracial considerations, but it cannot be read to require us to adopt rules\nthat unconstitutionally tie American politics to racial identity. If my\ndissenting brother's view of Gingles prevails, we will be well on our\nway to the creation of racially separate electorates and a racially sepa-\nrate society. Nothing in Supreme Court precedent compels us to take\nAmerica in that direction.\n\n                     32\n\fBy reversing the district court, the dissent would lead us not only\nto a relentlessly race-conscious trial, but also toward the restructuring\nof Alamance County electoral districts along racial lines. This is just\nwhat the Supreme Court does not allow. Bush, Shaw, and Miller did\nnot overrule Gingles, but they surely set limits on the ability of fed-\neral courts to cast voters as members of racial blocs rather than as\nindividuals. In order to identify the \"minority-preferred\" candidate,\nwe have been forced to wade into a bog of slippery assumptions and\nstatistics. In this case alone, we have been asked to assault such\nimpenetrable questions as: May a candidate who receives more than\n50% of the minority vote, but who finishes behind a successful\nminority-preferred candidate, also be considered preferred by the\nminority? If the candidate who is most preferred by the minority is\nunsuccessful, may other successful candidates who received substan-\ntial minority support be considered as preferred by the minority?\nShould votes for candidates cast by minority voters in general elec-\ntions be held not to express their true preferences when a candidate\nfavored by minority voters in the primary election failed to win a\nplace on the ballot for the general election? And, should votes for a\nminority-preferred candidate who is also an incumbent be disregarded\nwhen analyzing the successes of minority-preferred candidates?\n\nWhere will this road of race-consciousness end? As the above\nquestions demonstrate, the Gingles inquiry is complicated enough in\na biracial community. Is the inquiry to become ever more refined and\never more complex as America becomes more multicultural? How do\nwe identify minority-preferred candidates under Gingles when multi-\nple minorities are present? How shall we determine whether a candi-\ndate supported to a greater or lesser extent by different minorities is\nthe preferred candidate of a single minority? To what extent are the\nelectoral interests of different racial minorities to be aggregated or\nkept separate? How broadly or narrowly are the categories of racial\nminorities to be defined? At some point, this race-based calculus will\ndemonstrate only how far the law has set us on the path to disunion.\n\nEntering this maze of racially laden inquiries reflects a view of\nAmerican political life as a competition between highly segregated\nracial forces. Indeed, this is precisely the mistake of the dissent. The\ndissent's interpretation of Gingles will not allow courts to accept the\nvotes of minority individuals as expressing their personal preferences.\n\n                     33\n\fInstead, the dissent mandates that we pass the votes of minority indi-\nviduals under a microscope in order to determine the racial prefer-\nences expressed by those voters.\n\nUnder the dissent's view, all electoral behavior is reducible to race.\nThus, the dissent suggests that because voters prefer candidates of\ntheir own race, elections in which no minority was a candidate need\nnot be counted. The dissent further suggests that minority votes for\na candidate in a general election do not express a preference by the\nminority unless that candidate was also preferred by the minority in\nthe primary election; that a successful candidate who received more\nthan 50% of the minority vote, but finished behind a successful candi-\ndate who received a higher degree of minority support, should not\nautomatically be considered to be preferred by the minority; and that\ncertain electoral successes of incumbent, minority-preferred candi-\ndates should not count towards the success of minority individuals in\nelecting their preferred candidate.\n\nAnd these are but a few of the racially-driven factors that the dis-\nsent would fasten upon the judicial review of American elections. In\nits recent cases, the Supreme Court has made it clear that there is no\nroom in the Constitution for congressional redistricting schemes pred-\nicated predominantly on the basis of race. See Bush v. Vera, 116 S.Ct.\n1941 (1996); Shaw v. Hunt, 116 S.Ct. 1894 (1996); Miller v. Johnson,\n115 S.Ct. 2475 (1995). The dissent's interpretation of Gingles flies in\nthe face of this command by proposing a set of intricate inquiries\ndesigned to reinforce the view of American politics as a contest\nbetween separate racial voting blocs. The tendency of such rules to\n\"disrupt[ ] nonracial bases of political identity,\" Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n1962 (plurality opinion), will be no less than that of drawing district\nboundaries based on race, and they should be no more acceptable\nunder the Constitution. \"It takes a shortsighted and unauthorized view\nof the Voting Rights Act to invoke that statute, which has played a\ndecisive role in redressing some of our worst forms of discrimination,\nto demand the very racial stereotyping the Fourteenth Amendment\nforbids.\" Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2494. In leading us ineluctably to elec-\ntoral remedies based on racial shares, the dissent\"carr[ies] us further\nfrom the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters\n-- a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and\n\n                    34\n\fto which the Nation continues to aspire.\" Shaw v. Reno, 113 S.Ct.\n2816, 2832 (1993).*\n\nIt will be said that racial bloc voting is already ensconced in Amer-\nican political life and that courts must learn to embody in law what\nis established in fact. A Constitution, however, has its aspirational as\nwell as descriptive aspect. It is informed by the way things ought to\nbe. Were the Fourteenth Amendment no more than a concession to\nthe racial realities of the day, Brown v. Board of Education would\nhave remained an untaken step. Separation of the races is no better for\nAmerica now than it was in 1954. It is a sad turn that has led the\ncourts to rebuild the walls they once brought down.\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nSince 1980 no minority candidate has been elected to Alamance\nCounty's five-member Board of Commissioners. Indeed, since the\nVoting Rights Act was first passed in 1965, only one minority candi-\ndate has ever been elected to the Board of Commissioners. That can-\ndidate was initially appointed (not elected), and when he was first\nelected after his appointment, he ran in a special election that was not\nsubject to Alamance County's at-large voting system. In light of this\nhistory, I believe that members of the black community in Alamance\nCounty would be truly surprised to learn that they enjoy the same\nopportunity as white voters to elect their preferred candidates as\ncounty commissioners. Yet, in light of this same history, the majority\n_________________________________________________________________\n*My good colleague suggests in dissent that the concurring opinion\nfails to follow the law -- \"even when it is a law that we might think\nunwise or unnecessary in today's world.\" Of course, the district court fol-\nlowed the law when it found that the Alamance County system con-\nformed fully to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and did not operate\nto deny black citizens an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their\nchoice. In voting to reverse the district court, it is the dissent, I respect-\nfully suggest, that has failed to follow the law, because it has mandated\na collection of intensely race-conscious inquiries destined to result by\nway of remedy in the proportional allocation of electoral districts based\non race. To pursue this course in the wake of the Supreme Court's\nrepeated cautions against race-conscious districting is simply not sup-\nportable.\n\n                    35\n\fconcludes that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that minority-\npreferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc voting and\naffirms the award of summary judgment to the County.\n\nThe majority offers two main reasons for its decision. First, the\nmajority believes that the plaintiffs have failed to defeat the County's\nmotion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs have not \"prof-\nfer[ed] data from a sufficient number of elections to enable the district\ncourt to determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats\nminority-preferred candidates.\" Ante at 8. That is, because the plain-\ntiffs have not proffered evidence from elections in which no minority\nwas a candidate, the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nThe majority reaches this conclusion even though the plaintiffs have\nproffered election data from every election in which a minority was\na candidate, and even though the Supreme Court in Thornburg v.\nGingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), upheld a finding of vote dilution based\non an analysis of election data that included results from only those\nelections in which a minority was a candidate and that covered only\nthree election years.\n\nSecond, the majority believes that even if we only consider the\nelection data that the plaintiffs have proffered, the plaintiffs have still\nfailed to establish a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1973. In particular, under the majority's approach for\ndetermining who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, the\nplaintiffs have failed to show that minority voters' preferred candidate\nis usually defeated by white bloc voting. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe majority adopts a methodology that is unsound and unsupported\nby precedent. For example, even though primary election results pro-\nvide a means for assessing minority voter preference without the\neffects of partisanship, under the majority's approach it is improper\nto consider primary election data when determining who is and who\nis not a minority-preferred candidate in the general election. Ante at\n23-24. Thus, according to the majority, we should take raw election\ndata in isolation and disregard the probative value of considering gen-\neral election data in conjunction with primary election data (or in con-\njunction with any other circumstance in most cases).\n\nBecause I believe that neither of the majority's two reasons provide\ngrounds for affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment,\n\n                     36\n\fI respectfully dissent. At the very least, I believe that it is clear that\nthe plaintiffs have offered ample evidence showing that there is a gen-\nuine issue of material fact of whether minority-preferred candidates\nare usually defeated by white bloc voting. Therefore, the district\ncourt's order granting summary judgment should be reversed and the\ncase remanded for trial.\n\nI.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Gingles makes clear that the\nplaintiffs have the burden of proving each of the Court's three precon-\nditions, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48, including whether \"the white\nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it--in the absence of\nspecial circumstances, . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred\ncandidate.\" Id. at 51 (citations omitted). And the plurality opinion of\nJustice Brennan emphasizes that \"it is the status of the candidate as\nthe chosen representative of a particular racial group, not the race of\nthe candidate, that is important.\" Id. at 68 (Brennan, J., plurality opin-\nion) (emphasis in original).1 Yet, the Court's decision in Gingles\nnotes that:\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Justice Brennan's opinion on this point failed to gain a majority of the\nCourt, and it was joined by only Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Ste-\nvens. Justice White, who otherwise joined Justice Brennan's opinion,\nrejected the notion that the race of the candidate is irrelevant. Id. at 83\n(White, J., concurring). Justice O'Connor, in an opinion joined by Chief\nJustice Burger and Justices Powell and Rehnquist, agreed with Justice\nWhite that race of the candidate might affect the overall vote dilution\ninquiry. Id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Justice White and Justice\nO'Connor were concerned that ignoring the race of the candidate may\ncause the successful election of a black candidate not to be counted for\npurposes of identifying racial polarization. For instance, because black\nvoters often support the Democratic party, there was concern that the\nelection of a black Republican candidate would not be viewed as a\nminority success. See id., 478 U.S. at 83 (White, J., concurring) (\"This\nis interest-group politics rather than a rule hedging against racial discrim-\nination.\"); id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing with Justice\nWhite that \"Justice Brennan's conclusion that the race of the candidate\nis always irrelevant in identifying racially polarized voting conflicts with\nWhitcomb [v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971)] and is not necessary to the\ndisposition of this case.\"). Of course, the majority opinion in the present\n\n                     37\n\f          The number of elections that must be studied in order to\n          determine whether voting is polarized will vary according to\n          pertinent circumstances. One important circumstance is the\n          number of elections in which the minority group has spon-\n          sored candidates. Where a minority group has never been\n          able to sponsor a candidate, courts must rely on other factors\n          that tend to prove unequal access to the electoral process.\n          Similarly, where a minority group has begun to sponsor can-\n          didates just recently, the fact that statistics from only one or\n          a few elections are available for examination does not fore-\n          close a vote dilution claim.\n\nId. at 57 n.25; see Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. School Dist. Bd. of\nEduc., 4 F.3d 1103, 1130 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"The Supreme Court's lan-\nguage clearly indicates that an inability to offer statistical evidence on\na large number of elections should not foreclose a voting rights\nclaim.\") cert. denied, 114 S.

In\ntotal, the plaintiffs proffered election data from five general elections\nand six primary elections extending over twenty years. The election\ndata included the general elections in 1974, 1976, 1980, 1984, and\n1986, and the Democratic primaries in 1972, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984,\nand 1992. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (\"a pattern of racial bloc voting\nthat extends over a period of time is more probative of a claim that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncase turns the opinions of Justice Brennan, Justice White, and Justice\nO'Connor on their collective heads. That is, whereas the Supreme Court\nin Gingles was concerned with whether to count the election of a black\nRepublican for purposes of identifying racial polarization, the majority\nholds that the plaintiffs' action cannot withstand summary judgment\nbecause we must consider whether to count the election of white Demo-\ncrats for purposes of identifying racial polarization.\n\n                     38\n\fa district experiences legally significant polarization than are the\nresults of a single election\").\n\nIn turn, the County proffered no election data of its own. Instead,\nthe County moved for summary judgment arguing that the plaintiffs'\nown election data fails to support their contention that the minority\ngroup's preferred candidates are usually defeated by bloc voting\namong white voters of Alamance County. Neither before the district\ncourt, nor in its briefs to this court, did the County argue that it was\nentitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs had only ana-\nlyzed elections involving minority candidates. In essence, however,\nthat is what the majority has held here today.\n\nI disagree with this result because I believe that the plaintiffs have\nin fact offered sufficient evidence from which a fair assessment can\nbe made of whether minority-preferred candidates are usually\ndefeated by white bloc voting. In addition, I believe that if the County\nwishes to rebut the plaintiffs' evidence of racial polarization based on\nevidence from elections in which no minority was a candidate, then\nthe County should have the burden to produce such evidence.2 I will\nelaborate on each of these points below.\n\nA.\n\nNo court before today has ever dismissed a vote dilution claim\nbecause the plaintiffs failed to proffer evidence of elections in which\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 Also, I do not share the majority's uneasiness with the plaintiffs' reli-\nance on bivariate regression analyses. See ante at 5 n.3. If the County\nwishes to challenge the plaintiffs' statistical evidence as flawed, then it\nshould do so, and we should refrain from criticizing the statistical evi-\ndence in the absence of such a challenge. For instance, while it may (or\nmay not) be true that \"blacks and whites who live in integrated neighbor-\nhoods are more likely to vote for candidates of another race,\" id., the\nCounty has put forth no evidence or argument on this appeal that the\nplaintiffs' election data is flawed because it treated minority preference\nas constant across precincts. Cf. Smith v. Clinton, 687 F. Supp. 1310,\n1315 n.6 (E.D. Ark.) (three-judge court) (noting that the defendants did\nnot dispute the fact that a regression analysis is the \"standard method for\ninferring the behavior of population groups from data collected for politi-\ncal units\") (internal quotes omitted), aff'd mem., 488 U.S. 988 (1988).\n\n                     39\n\fno minority was a candidate. And, of course, the majority does not\nexpressly say that is what it is doing here. According to the majority,\nit \"hold[s] merely that it is insufficient to consider selectively only\nthose elections in which minority candidates were on the ballot, at\nleast where such elections are not such a substantial majority of the\ntotal elections that a fair assessment can be made of whether the\nminority-preferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc vot-\ning.\" Ante at 17. Yet, the majority makes clear that it believes that\n\"both elections in which the candidates are of the same race and elec-\ntions in which the candidates are of different races must be considered\nin order to determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats the\nminority-preferred candidate . . . .\" Id. at 9 (emphasis added).\n\nOf course, I agree that there must be sufficient election data pres-\nented from which a \"fair assessment can be made\" of the third\nGingles precondition. I cannot, however, agree that a \"fair assess-\nment\" must be based on data from a \"substantial majority of the total\nelections.\" Nor can I agree that elections in which no minority was\na candidate must be considered in all circumstances.\n\nDespite what the majority believes, there is no requirement under\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act or Supreme Court precedent that\nthe plaintiffs offer election data from \"a substantial majority of the\ntotal elections\" in order to show that minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated by white bloc voting. Likewise, even though \"a\nminority-preferred candidate may be either a minority or a non-\nminority,\" neither section 2 of the Voting Rights Act nor Supreme\nCourt precedent requires, as the majority claims, that we \"must\" con-\nsider (and plaintiffs must proffer) data from elections in which no\nminority was a candidate. See ante at 9. As I have said, not only did\nthe decision in Gingles uphold vote dilution claims based on election\ndata that included only those elections in which a minority was a can-\ndidate, but the Court specifically noted that \"[t]he number of elections\nthat must be studied in order to determine whether voting is polarized\nwill vary according to the pertinent circumstances.\" 468 U.S. at 57\nn.25 (emphasis added). And no court (at least before today) has ever\nsaid that there is a per se rule requiring that election data from elec-\ntions in which no minority was a candidate \"must\" be proffered. Cf.\nSanchez v. Bond, 875 F.2d 1488, 1495 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"We do not\nbelieve that a per se rule against examining races that have only white\n\n                    40\n\fcandidates is implicit in Gingles.\") (emphasis added), cert. denied,\n498 U.S. 937 (1990).3\n\nThis makes complete sense. While minority voters might prefer a\ncandidate from the majority (i.e., white) group, common experience\nshows that minority voters frequently prefer minority candidates. The\nopposite is true as well. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 68 (Brennan, J., plurality\nopinion) (\"Because both minority and majority voters often select\nmembers of their own race as their preferred representatives, it will\nfrequently be the case that a black candidate is the choice of blacks,\nwhile a white candidate is the choice of whites.\") (citation omitted);\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126 (\"experience does demonstrate that minority\ncandidates will tend to be candidates of choice among the minority\ncommunity\").\n\nMoreover, even though voter preference is what matters, minority\nsponsorship of a candidate is the basis for determining whether a can-\ndidate is minority preferred. Of course, sponsorship can be proven in\na number of different ways, and election data is only one of them.\nHowever, when a defendant neither argues nor proffers evidence that\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 The majority cites the decision in Brown v. Board of Commissioners,\n722 F. Supp. 380, 391 (E.D. Tenn. 1989), for the proposition that \"a\nreview of white/white elections as well as white/black elections is neces-\nsary to determine the existence of racially polarized voting.\" Ante at 13\nn.7. What, however, the majority fails to say is that the district court\nmade this remark in the context of \"this particular case.\" Brown, 722 F.\nSupp. at 391 (providing overview of elections in Chattanooga and stating\nthat \"blacks have . . . found themselves having to support white candi-\ndates in an effort to achieve a measure of political influence\"). See also\nSanchez, 875 F.2d at 1496 (affirming district court's decision to examine\nelections in which no minority was a candidate because the evidence\nshowed that a candidate could not receive the nomination and support of\nthe Democratic party without receiving minority support). Also, a court's\nleeway to examine elections in which no minority is a candidate does not\nmean that a court must examine such elections before a vote dilution\nclaim can be established, and it certainly does not mean that a plaintiff\nmust proffer such evidence in all cases (and on summary judgment). Cf.\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129 (\"district court may, in its discretion, decide to\nallow the defendants to introduce evidence on which, if any, white candi-\ndates were minority-preferred\") (emphasis added; footnote omitted).\n\n                     41\n\fthe minority has sponsored such a significant number of white candi-\ndates that a fair assessment can not be made without an analysis of\nelection data from elections in which no minority was a candidate, I\ndo not believe that we may require a plaintiff to proffer election data\nfrom white/white elections before a vote dilution claim can be proven.\n\nIndeed, when the minority's only choice is to vote for a white can-\ndidate or not to vote at all, such elections are, in general, less proba-\ntive on the issue of racial polarization than elections involving both\nblack and white candidates. As the Fifth Circuit has said:\n\n          \"[T]he evidence most probative of racially polarized voting\n          must be drawn from elections including both black and\n          white candidates.\" \"[W]hen there are only white candidates\n          to choose from it is `virtually unavoidable that certain white\n          candidates would be supported by a large percentage . . . of\n          black voters.'\" Thus, it is not particularly surprising--and\n          not particularly probative--that analysis of elections that\n          included only white candidates did not reveal any racial\n          polarization.\n\nWestwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, 946 F.2d\n1109, 1119 n.15 (5th Cir. 1991) (Westwego III ) (citations omitted;\nquoting Westwego I, 872 F.2d 1201, 1208 n.7 (5th Cir. 1989);\nCitizens for a Better Gretna v. City of Gretna, 834 F.2d 496, 502 (5th\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 904 (1989)); see ante at 15 (listing\ncases in which courts have held that black/white elections are more\nprobative than white/white elections). Therefore, if the defendant does\nnot bring forth evidence of particular circumstances showing that\nminority voters often choose to sponsor, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n.25,\nand not merely vote for white candidates, I believe that \"a fair assess-\nment can be made\" of the third Gingles precondition without the prof-\nfer of election data from elections in which no minority was a\ncandidate.\n\nA fair assessment is just that, and the plaintiffs in this case have\noffered more than sufficient election data from which we may discern\nelection patterns in Alamance County. The plaintiffs' election data\nspans the twenty years preceding the filing of the plaintiffs' complaint\nin October of 1992. During those twenty years, there were ten county\n\n                     42\n\fcommissioner elections, and of those ten elections the plaintiffs have\noffered election data from five general elections and six primary elec-\ntions. In other words, the plaintiffs have offered election data from a\nmajority of the county commissioner elections held within the two\ndecades preceding the filing of their complaint. I believe it is clear\nthat the proffer of such extensive election data as this satisfies the\nplaintiffs' burden to produce sufficient election data from which a fair\nassessment can be made. See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 61 (conclud-\ning that \"the District Court's approach, which tested data derived\nfrom three election years in each district, and which revealed that\nblacks strongly supported black candidates, while, to the black candi-\ndates' usual detriment, whites rarely did, satisfactorily addresses each\nfacet of the legal standard\"); Uno v. City of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 985\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"race-conscious politics (or its absence, for that mat-\nter) can more readily be seen by producing a documentary that spans\na series of elections than by taking an isolated snapshot of a single\nelection\").\n\nB.\n\nWhile the plaintiffs have the burden of proving the Gingles precon-\nditions, nothing prevents the defendant from offering election data of\nits own. And, as I have said, black/white elections are generally more\nprobative than white/white elections. It therefore follows that if the\nplaintiffs have proffered election data sufficient to provide a \"fair\nassessment\" of the third Gingles precondition, and that election data\nonly involves black/white elections, the defendant is free to counter\nwith evidence of election data from elections in which no minority\nwas a candidate. As the Third Circuit has said:\n\n          We . . . do not believe that plaintiffs are required to pres-\n          ent evidence on white versus white elections if they do not\n          believe that those elections are probative. If the defendants\n          want to introduce evidence on those elections in an attempt\n          to rebut the plaintiffs' evidence of cohesiveness or white\n          bloc voting, they may do so. Nevertheless, because white\n          versus white elections tend to be less probative, there may\n          still be cases in which \"[t]he evidence of polarized voting\n          . . . is so strong . . . that it cannot be overcome even when\n\n                    43\n\f          all reasonable inferences are accorded to the evidence of\n          elections involving only white candidates.\"\n\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1128-29 (quoting Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1317); see\nUno, 72 F.2d at 988 & n.8 (noting that when district court only exam-\nined elections involving minority candidates, \"evidence exhumed\nfrom `white only' elections may still be relevant in assessing the total-\nity of the circumstances in a vote dilution case, especially if it tends\nto rebut the evidence of cohesion or white bloc voting extracted from\n`mixed' elections\") (emphasis added; citation omitted).\n\nIn this case, the County offered no evidence from white/white elec-\ntions. And, in fact, the County has not even argued that such elections\nare probative. Accordingly, the majority is simply wrong to uphold\nthe district court's decision granting summary judgment because the\nplaintiffs have not offered evidence from elections in which no minor-\nity was a candidate.\n\nII.\n\nThe majority is also wrong to conclude that if we only consider the\nelection data that the plaintiffs have proffered from black/white elec-\ntions, the plaintiffs have still failed to establish a violation of section\n2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973. Ante at 8. In particular,\nI believe that the majority's (and the district court's) methodology for\ndetermining who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate is\nfundamentally flawed and that the County is not entitled to summary\njudgment when the election data put forth by the plaintiffs is properly\nconsidered.\n\nInitially, I emphasize that the majority opinion does not squarely\naddress the issue of the procedural posture of this case. We are hear-\ning this case on appeal from the district court's grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the County, and not after a trial on the merits.\nTherefore, it is the moving party (i.e., the County) that has the burden\nof showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring a\ntrial, and we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-\nmoving party (i.e., the plaintiffs). In addition, while the plaintiffs here\nbear the ultimate burden of persuasion on their vote dilution claim,\nthe County must show that there is an absence of evidence to support\n\n                     44\n\fthe plaintiffs' claim in order to succeed on summary judgment. See,\ne.g., Marylanders for Fair Representation, Inc. v. Schaefer, 849 F.\nSupp. 1022, 1030 (D. Md. 1994) (three-judge court) (citing Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)). And while we have\npreviously said that plaintiffs in a vote dilution case cannot \"pass the\nsummary judgment threshold\" unless they establish all the Gingles\npreconditions, McGhee v. Granville County, 860 F.2d 110, 117 (4th\nCir. 1988) (internal quotes and citation omitted), I believe that the\nplaintiffs here have adequately established the Gingles preconditions\nfor purposes of defeating the County's motion for summary judgment.4\n\nMoreover, because we are reviewing this case on summary judg-\nment, I do not believe that the district court's factual findings are enti-\ntled to deference. The district court assessed a paper record, and we\nshould, as we normally do on summary judgment, review the court's\nfindings de novo. Cf. ante at 22-23, 27-28 (upholding district court's\nfactual findings under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).5\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 As I have noted, the County has not even argued that the plaintiffs\nmust submit election data from white/white elections, nor has the County\nsubmitted any such data. In short, the County has not shown that the\nabsence of data on white/white elections means that there is insufficient\nevidence to support the plaintiffs' vote dilution claim. Therefore, under\nbasic summary judgment principles, I am at a loss as to how the majority\ncan conclude that the County is entitled to summary judgment because\nthe plaintiffs have not proffered election data from white/white elections.\n5 The Court in Gingles did not discuss what level of deference an\nappellate court is to accord a district court's factual findings on summary\njudgment. The Court did, however, stress that because of the fact inten-\nsive nature of a vote dilution claim, a district court's factual findings\nmade after trial are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule\n52(a). As the Court said:\n\n          We reaffirm our view that the clearly-erroneous test of Rule\n          52(a) is the appropriate standard of appellate review of a finding\n          of vote dilution. As both amended ยง 2 and its legislative history\n          make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution\n          through districting, the trial court is to consider the \"totality of\n          the circumstances\" and to determine, based \"upon a searching\n          practical evaluation of `the past and present reality,'\" [S. Rep.\n\n                    45\n\fOf course, the legal standards that the district court applied are not\nentitled to any deference. And even if there had been a trial on the\nmerits in this case, we would still have the \"power to correct errors\nof law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of\nlaw and fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunder-\nstanding of the governing rule of law.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (inter-\nnal quotes and citations omitted). Accordingly, I turn now to the\nerrors of law that infected the district court's decision in this case--\nerrors that the majority has simply compounded.\n\nA.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge the methodology employed by the district\ncourt on several grounds. First, the plaintiffs argue that the district\ncourt erred \"[b]y grouping together white candidates for whom black\nvoters voted only in the absence of other alternatives with candidates\nwho were enthusiastically and overwhelmingly supported by black\nvoters (and who were, with one exception, black) . .. .\" Appellants'\nBrief at 16. According to the plaintiffs, the fact that many white Dem-\nocratic candidates received substantial electoral support from black\nvoters in general elections does not show that these candidates are\nminority preferred. Rather, it is a reflection of the fact that when the\nonly electoral choice is to vote for a white Republican or a white\nDemocrat, blacks in Alamance County usually choose the white Dem-\n_________________________________________________________________\n           No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in 1982\n           U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208 (footnote omitted)], whether the political\n           process is equally open to minority voters. \"`This determination\n           is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case,'\" Rodgers [v.\n           Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 621 (1982)], quoting Nevett v. Sides, 571\n           F.2d 209, 224 (5th Cir. 1978), and requires \"an intensely local\n           appraisal of the design and impact\" of the contested electoral\n           mechanisms. 458 U.S. at 622.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (emphasis added). In the absence of a trial, it is\ndifficult to imagine how the district court can make\"a searching practical\nevaluation of `the past and present reality'\" to determine who is and who\nis not a minority-preferred candidate. Without such an evaluation, there\nis no reason or basis for deferring to the district court's factual findings\nunder the clearly erroneous standard.\n\n                     46\n\focrat. Therefore, the district court should have conducted an individu-\nalized assessment of each candidate that received a majority of the\nminority's support in the general election to determine if that candi-\ndate was truly minority preferred. For example, the district court\nshould have examined primary election results (nominating elections\nwhere the effects of partisan voting are minimized) to determine the\nblack community's true level of support for a particular candidate.\n\nSecond, while the district court failed to examine primary elections\nto help determine who is and who is not minority preferred, the plain-\ntiffs argue that the district court erred because it equated success in\nprimary elections with success in general elections. This, according\nto the plaintiffs, is wrong because \"winning the primary does not\nplace the winner in office.\" Id. at 25.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs believe that the district court erred because it\nfailed to discount the three election victories of Jack O'Kelley, the\nonly black candidate ever elected to Alamance County's Board of\nCommissioners. Id. at 26. In particular, the plaintiffs contend that the\ndistrict court should not have counted O'Kelley's election victories\nbecause O'Kelley first gained office by appointment, not election. In\nother words, unlike every other county commissioner, O'Kelley has\nalways been an incumbent. Thus, the factual circumstances surround-\ning his election victories are not typical, and they provide little guid-\nance for determining whether white bloc voting usually defeats the\nminority's preferred candidate.\n\nThe majority disagrees with much of what the plaintiffs argue,\nthough to its credit the majority does correctly recognize that \"pri-\nmary and general elections results should not be aggregated for pur-\nposes of determining whether black-preferred candidates are `usually'\nsuccessful . . . .\" Ante at 27. Thus, the majority evidently agrees with\nthe plaintiffs that even though a minority-preferred candidate wins in\nthe primary, this success alone does not count for purposes of deter-\nmining whether the minority is usually able to elect its preferred can-\ndidates to office. And I too agree on this point.\n\nNevertheless, I cannot agree with the majority's conclusions with\nrespect to the plaintiffs' other assigned errors. According to the\nmajority, the district court actually \"erred in plaintiffs' favor by not\n\n                     47\n\ftreating as `black-preferred' some . . . candidates who placed second\nor third among black voters (and with a significant majority of black\nvotes) behind an unsuccessful candidate who was the first choice of\nblack voters.\" Ante at 17-18. Also, the majority believes that the dis-\ntrict court did not err when it failed to conduct an individualized\ndetermination of candidates who placed second or third among minor-\nity voters when the minority's first choice was successful. Ante at 22-\n23. Furthermore, the majority rejects the plaintiffs' argument that pri-\nmary election results provide a basis to help determine whether a can-\ndidate is minority preferred in the general election. See ante at 23-26.\nAnd the majority believes that the district court did not err in giving\nfull weight to the three election victories of Jack O'Kelley. Ante at 27.\n\nI believe that in reaching these conclusions the majority has seri-\nously misread the Supreme Court's decision in Gingles, our own pre-\ncedent, and precedent from our sister circuits. As I explain below, the\ncritical error that both the majority and the district court make is to\nisolate election data from the actual circumstances surrounding an\nelection and then to treat such data as dispositive for purposes of\ndetermining who is a minority-preferred candidate (though, under\nmost circumstances, the majority does not treat the data as dispositive\nfor purposes of determining who is not a minority-preferred candidate).6\nGranted, election data (taken in isolation) provides some guidance in\nmaking a determination of who is and who is not a minority-preferred\ncandidate. However, both section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and\nGingles demand a more searching inquiry than mere reference to the\npercentage of minority voter support that a candidate has received,\nparticularly when the candidate is not a minority and an at-large vot-\ning system is employed. At the very least, we must examine the par-\nticular circumstances of each case to discern whether the electoral\nsupport that minority voters give a candidate (especially in general\nelections) truly reflects minority voters' preference or whether such\nsupport is itself a manifestation of a structural inequality in the chal-\nlenged voting system.\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 When questioned at his deposition, the plaintiffs' expert fell into\nsomewhat the same trap as the majority and the district court, acknowl-\nedging minority-preferred candidates based on election data taken in iso-\nlation.\n\n                    48\n\f1.\n\nWe have covered much of this ground before. See Collins v. City\nof Norfolk, 883 F.2d 1232 (4th Cir. 1989) (Collins II), cert. denied,\n498 U.S. 938 (1990).7 At-large voting schemes may work to create\nthe appearance of minority preference where none actually exists\nbecause once the number of seats up for election exceeds the number\nof candidates that minority voters \"prefer,\" minority voters face the\nchoice of either voting for a candidate that they do not actually prefer\nor not voting at all. Thus, the fact that a candidate receives a majority\nof the minority vote does not automatically make that candidate a\nminority-preferred candidate for purposes of the third Gingles precon-\ndition. As we explained in Collins II:\n\n           The mere election of a candidate who appears to have\n           received votes from more than fifty percent of minority bal-\n           lots does not count as a minority electoral success, when\n           each ballot may contain votes for more than one candidate.\n           In such a situation, if there were other candidates, preferred\n           by a significantly higher percentage of the minority commu-\n           nity, who were defeated in the same election, then it cannot\n_________________________________________________________________\n7 In Collins II the minority plaintiffs challenged the at-large voting sys-\ntem used to elect the City Council in Norfolk, Virginia. We explained\nthat \"`[t]he essence of a ยง 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice,\nor structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an\ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect\ntheir preferred candidates.'\" Id. at 1236 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n47). We then stated that \"[t]he proper identification of minority voters'\n`representatives of their choice' is critical.\" Id. at 1237. And, we recog-\nnized that the plaintiffs' primary complaint was not that minority voters\nwere unable to elect their first choice to the city council, but rather that\nthe at-large voting system prevented minority voters from electing a sec-\nond preferred candidate as well. Id. at 1240 (\"In the context of this case\nit is necessary to apply Gingles' teaching to the black community's\nattempt to elect a second black councilman.\"). For this reason alone, the\nmajority is wrong to say that Collins II left open the question of how to\ntreat second- and third-place finishers when the minority's first choice is\nsuccessful. See ante at 22. Because minority voters in Norfolk were able\nto elect one candidate, Collins II clearly addresses the situation where\nthere is a successful minority-preferred candidate.\n\n                     49\n\f          fairly be said that the minority community has successfully\n          elected representatives of its choice. Each situation must be\n          reviewed individually to determine whether the elected can-\n          didates can be fairly considered as representatives of the\n          minority community. The presumption must be that they\n          cannot, if some other candidate has received significantly\n          more minority votes.\n\n883 F.2d at 1238 (emphasis added; quoting Collins IV, 816 F.2d 932,\n937 (4th Cir. 1987)).\n\nCollins II thus demands a two-step inquiry. In the first step we\ndecide whether there is a presumption that a candidate is or is not\nminority preferred. When an unsuccessful candidate receives a signif-\nicantly higher percentage of the minority vote than candidates who\nwin election with a majority of the minority vote, the elected candi-\ndates are presumed not to be minority preferred. When, however, an\nunsuccessful candidate receives a percentage of the minority vote\nwhich is not significantly higher than that of the elected second- and\nthird-place finishers, we presume that the second- and third-place fin-\nishers are minority preferred. Either way, however, the election data\nonly creates a presumption.\n\nIn the second step of the inquiry the district court must determine\nwhether the presumption is supported by other facts. The court must\nmake an individualized determination of \"whether the elected candi-\ndates can be fairly considered as representatives of the minority com-\nmunity.\" Depending on the outcome of the first step, there may be a\npresumption for or against finding that a candidate is minority pre-\nferred, but regardless of the presumption the district court must make\nan individualized determination in \"[e]ach situation.\" Such an individ-\nualized determination is required, because as both Congress and the\nSupreme Court recognize, \"whether the political processes are equally\nopen depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and\npresent reality, and on a functional view of the political process.\" S.\nRep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in 1982\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 & 79.\n\nThe majority recognizes that Collins II demands a two-step inquiry.\nSee ante at 19. The majority, however, misconstrues the inquiry.\n\n                    50\n\fUnder the first step, according to the majority, a second- or third-\nplace finisher is minority preferred if the unsuccessful first choice\nreceived a percentage of the minority vote which is not significantly\nhigher than that of the elected second- and third-place finishers. Id.\nIn this situation, the majority believes that a district court need not\n(and evidently cannot) proceed to the second step of the inquiry in\norder to make the individualized determination required under the Act\nand Gingles. Id. at 20 (\"Because[unsuccessful candidate] Morris'\nsupport among black voters was not `significantly higher' than [suc-\ncessful candidate] Long's, the district court appears to have erred in\nnot automatically treating Long as a black-preferred candidate.\")\n(emphasis added).\n\nNeedless to say, cutting off the inquiry at the first step makes a\ncourt's \"searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality\"\ndependent exclusively upon election results taken in isolation. Yet,\nbecause at-large voting systems often fail to provide an accurate view\nof the political process (among other things, they may create the\nappearance of minority preference), I believe that a court must pro-\nceed to the second step of the inquiry even when\"the unsuccessful\nfirst choice among minority voters did not receive a`significant\nhigher percentage' of the minority community's support.\"\n\nOf course, when the level of support received by the unsuccessful\nfirst-place finisher among minority voters is \"significantly higher\"\nthan the support given the second- and third-place finishers by those\nsame voters, the majority agrees that only a presumption is created\nagainst finding that the second- and third-place finishers are minority\npreferred. Id. at 21 (asserting that \"we held in Collins II (sic) only that\nsuccessful candidates who receive more than 50% of the black vote\nshould not automatically be viewed as a black-preferred candidate if\nthey receive significantly less support from black voters than another,\nlosing candidate, not that they should never be treated as black-\npreferred\") (emphasis in original). I fail, however, to discern any rea-\nson for creating the presumption (and proceeding to the second step)\nonly when an unsuccessful first-place finisher receives a significantly\nhigher percentage of the minority vote, and neither the Act, nor\nGingles, nor Collins II supports the majority's conclusion to the con-\ntrary.\n\n                     51\n\fFor much the same reason, the majority is also wrong to conclude\nthat \"any candidate who receives a majority of the minority vote and\nwho finishes behind a successful candidate who was the first choice\namong the minority voters is automatically to be deemed a black-\npreferred candidate . . . .\" Ante at 22 (emphasis in original). Indeed,\nunder the majority's theory even when a successful minority-preferred\ncandidate garners significantly higher minority support than success-\nful second- and third-place finishers (who receive over 50 percent of\nthe minority vote), a district court must automatically treat the suc-\ncessful second-and third-place finishers as minority-preferred candi-\ndates. And, in fact, the majority goes so far as to conclude that even\nthough a candidate fails to gain a majority of the minority vote, there\nis a presumption that the candidate is minority preferred provided that\nthe candidate would have won a seat in an at-large election among\nblack voters. Id. at 22 (stating that \"[c]andidates who receive less than\n50% of the minority vote, but who would have been elected had the\nelection been held only among black voters, are presumed also to be\nminority-preferred candidates, although an individualized assessment\nshould be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may appro-\npriately be so considered\"). That has never been the law, nor should\nit be.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n8 The flaw in the majority's approach is illustrated by the following\nhypothetical. An at-large election for four slots is held. There are eight\ncandidates. Candidate number 1 wins with 99 percent of the minority\nvote; candidate number 2 loses with 95 percent of the minority vote; can-\ndidate number 3 wins with 51 percent of the minority vote; candidate\nnumber 4 wins with 20 percent of the minority vote; candidate number\n5 loses with 15 percent of the minority vote; candidate number 6 loses\nwith 10 percent of the minority vote; candidate number 7 loses with 5\npercent of the minority vote; and candidate number 8 wins with 3 percent\nof the minority vote. According to the majority, we must automatically\ntreat candidate number 3 as minority preferred even though that candi-\ndate received far less support than candidate number 1 or candidate num-\nber 2. Also, according to the majority, there is a presumption that\ncandidate number 4 is minority preferred even though that candidate\nreceived the support of only one in five minority voters. That cannot be\nright. It also directly conflicts with our holding in Collins II, because as\nI have previously noted, see supra at 49 n.7, in Collins II (as in the above\nhypothetical), the minority was successful in electing its first candidate\nof choice. See 883 F.2d at 1240.\n\n                  52\n\fThe only way that the majority can reach these conclusions is to\ndisregard our clear language in Collins II and other precedent\nthroughout the circuits. These are decisions that hold that a successful\ncandidate is not automatically minority preferred merely because that\ncandidate receives more than 50% of the minority vote. And these are\ndecisions that either hold or assume that a candidate who receives less\nthan 50% of the minority vote cannot (by definition) be minority pre-\nferred. As we stated in Collins II:\n\n          The district court's error in finding successful candidates\n          who received over 50% of the minority vote to be the cho-\n          sen representatives of the minority community, despite the\n          fact that other candidates received a much greater percent-\n          age of the minority vote, is not simply technical or semantic.\n          ...\n\n          A moment's reflection shows how the district court's\n          method of identifying the black community's representa-\n          tives of choice defeats a primary purpose of the Act. In\n          1974, 21 candidates sought the 4 open seats on the council.\n          In 1980, 12 candidates vied for 3 open seats. In 1974, each\n          voter--black and white--could cast four votes and in 1980\n          three votes. If black voters exercised their right to cast all\n          of their allotted votes, they ran the risk that their second and\n          third choices would be declared their preferred candidates.\n          Only by single-shot voting--withholding all votes save for\n          their first choice, and forfeiting the opportunity to cast all\n          votes allotted to each voter--could the minority be assured\n          that its second and third choices would not be declared its\n          preferred candidates. In contrast, under the at-large system,\n          the white voters can freely cast all votes allotted to them\n          without suffering the penalty imposed on the minority vot-\n          ers. The district court's construction of the Act defeats the\n          congressional purpose of assuring that the opportunity to\n          participate in the electoral process is open to all citizens.\n\n          We are aware of no case that supports the district court's\n          construction of the Act.\n\n883 F.2d at 1239-40 (emphasis added); see NAACP v. Niagara Falls,\n65 F.3d 1002, 1019 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"a candidate cannot be `minority-\n\n                    53\n\fpreferred' if that candidate receives support from fewer than 50% of\nminority voters.\") (emphasis added); id. (\"even if a candidate receives\n50% or more of the minority vote, a court need not treat the candidate\nas minority-preferred if another candidate receives significantly\nhigher support\"); Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1126 (\"it is important to look\nbeyond whether a white candidate received a majority of the minority\ncommunity's vote and determine whether that white candidate is truly\nthe minority community's representative of choice\"); Campos v. City\nof Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1245 (5th Cir. 1988) (rejecting the argu-\nment that \"any time a candidate gets a majority of the minority votes\nhe is the `chosen representative' of the minority group\"), cert. denied,\n492 U.S. 905 (1989). See also Uno, 72 F.3d at 989 (\"[D]etermining\nwhether racial bloc voting exists is not merely an arithmetic exercise\nthat consists of toting up columns of numbers, and nothing more. To\nthe contrary, the district court should not confine itself to raw num-\nbers, but must make a practical, commonsense assay of all the evi-\ndence.\") (citations omitted).\n\nThe effect of the majority's unprecedented decision will be to\nundermine the Voting Rights Act. After today, structural inequalities\nthat may be at work in at-large voting systems will be masked by the\nstructure itself, perpetuating those very inequalities that the Act is\nintended to remedy. The reason for this is simple. As I have\nexplained, at-large voting systems may work to create the appearance\nof minority preference where none actually exists. Thus, to allow\nelection results alone to dictate whether a candidate is minority pre-\nferred is to validate the structural inequalities which may be present\nin at-large voting systems based on the system itself. That is circular\nreasoning, I believe.\n\nWe are bound to follow Collins II. In sum, therefore, we should\nhold that a district court must always make an individualized determi-\nnation of whether any second- or third-place finisher who receives a\nmajority of the minority vote is actually minority preferred. When a\nminority-preferred candidate (whether successful or not) receives a\nsignificantly higher percentage of the minority vote, we must presume\nthat the second- or third-place finisher who receives a majority of the\nminority vote is not minority preferred. When a minority-preferred\ncandidate (whether successful or not) does not receive a significantly\nhigher percentage of the minority vote, we must presume that the sec-\n\n                    54\n\fond-or third-place finisher is minority preferred, provided that the\nsecond- or third-place finisher received a majority of the minority\nvote. And when any candidate receives less than a majority of the\nminority vote, that candidate can never be deemed minority preferred.\n\n2.\n\nI also believe that it is clear that when making an individualized\ndetermination of who is and who is not a minority-preferred candi-\ndate, a district court must examine the particular facts and circum-\nstances surrounding each election and candidate in order to ascertain\nwhich, if any, candidate or candidates the minority community has\nsponsored. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n.25. In other words, the dis-\ntrict court must look at the totality of the circumstances in each situa-\ntion.\n\nThere is nothing unique about this approach, and depending on the\nfacts, it may help or hurt plaintiffs' ability to prevail in a vote dilution\ncase. See, e.g., Uno, 72 F.3d at 989 (criticizing district court for fail-\ning to take into account city's \"rapidly changing political environ-\nment\" which may have allowed the minority group to sponsor\nsuccessful candidates); Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129 (\"In deciding which,\nif any, of the white candidates were minority preferred, the court must\nengage in a detailed, practical evaluation of the extent to which any\nparticular white candidate was, as a realistic matter, the minority vot-\ners' representative of choice.\"); Collins II , 883 F.2d at 1238 (\"in addi-\ntion to the bare statistics, it is appropriate to consider testimony\nrevealing how political observers and the candidates themselves\nviewed the city's claim that [the candidates] were the minority's pre-\nferred candidates and representatives of choice\"); Smith, 687 F. Supp.\nat 1316-17 (emphasizing that \"considerable weight\" should be given\nto elections between black and white candidates, but still examining\nmultiple factors to determine minority voters' representatives of\nchoice).\n\nBecause we should examine the totality of the circumstances, a dis-\ntrict court should not hesitate to look at any evidence that might be\nprobative. Accordingly, I can not agree with the majority that primary\nelection results do not bear on the question of who is and who is not\na minority-preferred candidate. See ante at 23-26. Cf. Niagara Falls,\n\n                     55\n\f65 F.3d at 1019 (\"When a candidate receives support from 50% or\nmore of minority voters in a general election, a court need not treat\nthe candidate as minority-preferred when another candidate receiving\ngreater support in the primary failed to reach the general election.\");\nSanchez, 875 F.2d at 1496 (examining totality of the circumstances,\nincluding \"testimony to the effect that no candidate could secure the\nDemocratic slot in county races without the support of a group of His-\npanics that included some of the plaintiffs\"). Moreover, I believe that\nwhile the race of the candidate is not dispositive, it too is a fact which\nin the totality of the circumstances the court may consider. See\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129. Again, \"whether the political processes are\nequally open depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the\npast and present reality, and on a functional view of the political pro-\ncess.\" S. Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 & 79. A district\ncourt should not therefore refrain from examining election data from\nprimaries in order to help determine who is and who is not a minority-\npreferred candidate. Nor should the district court ignore the fact that\nminority voters often support minority candidates.\n\nWhen, for example, a white candidate fails to gain a majority of the\nminority vote in the primary election (yet still wins nomination), the\nfact that such a candidate subsequently gains a majority of the minor-\nity vote in the general election is of minimal probative value. This is\nespecially true when minority voters strongly support a losing minor-\nity candidate in the primary election process.9 Simply put, while the\nmajority may be correct to say that minority voters do not \"take their\nmarbles and go home whenever the candidate whom they prefer most\nin the primary does not prevail,\" ante at 24, the requirements of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Obviously, while we should treat the defeat of a minority-preferred\ncandidate in a primary as a defeat for purposes of determining whether\nGingles' third precondition has been met, we should not treat the success\nof a minority-preferred candidate in receiving his or her party's nomina-\ntion as a success for purposes of the same inquiry. Only if a minority-\npreferred candidate is actually elected has the minority succeeded in the\nelectoral process. Winning the primary is all to the good, but without\nwinning the general election, white majority bloc voting may have still\nsucceeded in defeating the minority-preferred candidate or candidates.\n\n                     56\n\fVoting Rights Act are not met if \"[c]andidates favored by blacks can\nwin, but only if the candidates are white.\" Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1318.10\n\n3.\n\nAs a district court must examine the totality of the circumstances\nto determine who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, a\ndistrict court must also examine whether \"special circumstances\" have\nresulted in a minority-preferred candidate winning a particular elec-\ntion or elections. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51 & 57. In such a case, a claim\nof vote dilution may still succeed because a pattern of racial bloc vot-\ning may still result in the defeat of minority-preferred candidates\nunder normal election conditions. See id. at 57 (\"the success of a\nminority candidate in a particular election does not necessarily prove\nthat the district did not experience polarized voting in that election;\nspecial circumstances, such as the absence of an opponent, incum-\n_________________________________________________________________\n10 In Jenkins the Third Circuit outlined the following non-exhaustive\nlist of factors that a court should examine when deciding whether a white\ncandidate may properly be considered minority preferred:\n\n          One relevant consideration is the extent to which the minority\n          community can be said to have sponsored the candidate. In\n          determining whether the minority community sponsored the can-\n          didate, the court should look to the level of minority involvement\n          in initially advancing the particular candidate and in conducting\n          or financing that candidate's campaign.\n\n          Additionally, the attention which the candidate gave to the\n          particular needs and interests of the minority community, includ-\n          ing the extent to which the candidate campaigned in predomi-\n          nately minority areas or addressed predominately minority\n          crowds and interests, may be relevant factors.\n\n          Another relevant consideration would be the rates at which\n          black voters turned out when a minority candidate sought office\n          as compared to elections involving only white candidates.\n          Finally, bearing in mind the disincentives that may exist for\n          minority candidates to seek office, the extent to which minority\n          candidates have run for office and the ease or difficulty with\n          which a minority candidate can qualify to run for office may be\n          relevant considerations.\n\n4 F.3d at 1129 (citations omitted).\n\n                    57\n\fbency, or the utilization of bullet voting, may explain minority elec-\ntoral success in a polarized contest\") (footnote omitted).\n\nHere, for example, I believe that the district court erred when it\ncounted as minority electoral success all three election victories of\nblack candidate Jack O'Kelley. At the very least the district court\nshould have discounted O'Kelley's first election victory in 1974. That\nelection and the candidacy of O'Kelley were atypical for two reasons.\nFirst, O'Kelley was initially appointed (not elected) to fill a vacant\nslot on the Board of Commissioners. He thus ran as an incumbent\neven though he had never been elected. Second, and more impor-\ntantly, the 1974 general election was both a special election for the\nseat to which O'Kelley had previously been appointed, and it was an\nat-large election for two other seats on the Commission. And, of\ncourse, O'Kelley ran in the special election, not the at-large election.\nThus, I would hold that as a matter of law O'Kelley's incumbency,\ncoupled with his appointment and the unique nature of his 1974 elec-\ntion, constitute special circumstances requiring that we discount this\nelection victory.\n\nAs for O'Kelley's second and third elections in 1976 and 1980, it\nmay or may not be appropriate to count these elections as instances\nwhere the minority was successful in electing its preferred candidate.\nBecause of the odd nature of the 1974 election, O'Kelley was forced\nto run for reelection after only two years (not the normal four years).\nAccordingly, there is evidence that \"special circumstances\" exist that\nalso might require us to discount O'Kelley's 1976 election. As for the\n1980 election, the effects of O'Kelley's initial appointment, coupled\nwith his incumbency, may still persist. And, as the Court in Gingles\nexpressly recognizes, incumbency may constitute a special circum-\nstance in certain situations. 478 U.S. at 57. Accordingly, because we\nhear this case on an appeal from summary judgment, I would hold\nthat there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether O'Kelley's\nsecond and third election victories should be counted for purposes of\nGingles' third precondition. These fact issues should be resolved at\ntrial, after the district court has examined the totality of the circum-\nstances surrounding O'Kelley's second and third election victories.\n\nB.\n\nIn light of the proper methodology described above, I turn now to\nexamine the election data that the plaintiffs have proffered. Of course,\n\n                     58\n\fbecause there has been no trial, and thus no \"individual determina-\ntions\" of who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment should be reversed for this\nreason alone. In addition, even if we merely examine the election\ndata, I believe it clear that the presumptions we recognized as appro-\npriate in Collins II indicate that minority-preferred candidates have\nrarely been successful. I would therefore hold that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated by white bloc voting and that the case should be\nremanded for trial.\n\nThe 1972 Election:\n\nIn 1972 Morris (a black candidate) received 98% of the black vote\nin the Democratic primary but was defeated nonetheless. Long (a\nwhite candidate) received 84% of the black vote and was nominated.\nNo other candidate received a majority of the minority vote. Thus,\nassuming that 98% of the vote is not \"significantly higher\" than 84%\nof the vote, there is a presumption that we have two minority-\npreferred candidates--one of whom we know lost (Morris). Because\nneither party has proffered election data from the 1972 general elec-\ntion, it would appear that we cannot determine whether Long was suc-\ncessful or not in the general election. However, candidate Long also\nran in the 1974 election. It is thus apparent that Long was not elected\nin 1972. Accordingly, we may presume that minority voters were not\nable to elect either of their preferred candidates in 1972.\n\nThe 1974 Election:\n\nThe parties have failed to provide the primary results from the\n1974 Democratic primary, but Newlin (a white candidate) won the\ngeneral election with 99% of the black vote, and Long lost with 99%\nof the black vote. I will therefore count Newlin as a successful\nminority-preferred candidate and Long as an unsuccessful minority\ncandidate (though again the record is incomplete on this point). Also,\nas I have said, O'Kelley's election is not counted because he had\nrecently been appointed to the Board of Commissioners, and he was\nrunning to fill a single vacant seat. Thus, as of 1974 there is a pre-\nsumption that there had been four minority-preferred candidates, one\ncandidate who was elected and three candidates who were not.\n\n                     59\n\fThe 1976 Election:\n\nIn 1976 only O'Kelley received the support of a majority of black\nvoters in the Democratic primary election. Therefore, he is the only\ncandidate that should be presumed minority preferred. But again,\nbecause O'Kelley did not serve a full term after his 1974 election, it\nmay be inappropriate to count his success in the general election.\nThus, as of 1976 there still had been only four minority-preferred can-\ndidates, only one of whom was elected.\n\nThe 1978 Election:\n\nIn the 1978 Democratic primary, Harris (a black candidate)\nreceived 78% of the black vote but was not nominated, and Newlin\n(a white candidate) received 60% of the black vote and was nomi-\nnated. The majority does not disagree that Harris's support among\nminority voters was significantly higher than Newlin's support. See\nante at 20-21. In addition, the district court reached the same conclu-\nsion. We should therefore presume that there was only one minority-\npreferred candidate in 1978 (Harris). Because he was unsuccessful, as\nof 1978 there had been five minority-preferred candidates, one candi-\ndate who was elected and four candidates who were not.\n\nThe 1980 Election:\n\nIn the 1980 Democratic primary, O'Kelley received 99% of the\nblack vote and was nominated, and Fleming (a white candidate)\nreceived 57% of the black vote but was not nominated. No other can-\ndidate received a majority of the minority vote in the primary. Thus,\nfor purposes of summary judgment I would not count either O'Kelley\nor Fleming as minority preferred. The effects of O'Kelley's initial\nappointment (coupled with his incumbency) may still persist, though\nless so than in 1974 and 1976. And Fleming did not receive \"signifi-\ncantly\" close to the same amount of support as O'Kelley. Accord-\ningly, as of 1980, there remained five minority-preferred candidates,\none candidate who was elected and four candidates who were not.\n\nThe 1984 Election:\n\nIn the 1984 Democratic primary, Freeman (a black candidate)\nreceived 98% of the black vote and was nominated. Paris (a white\n\n                     60\n\fcandidate) received 50% of the black vote but was not nominated.\nBecause Freeman's minority support was significantly higher than\nParis's, I would presume that Paris was not a minority-preferred can-\ndidate. In the general election, Freeman lost. Therefore, as of 1984\nthere had been six minority-preferred candidates, one who was\nelected and five who were not.\n\nThe 1986 Election:\n\nThe parties have not provided primary results for 1986. In the gen-\neral election, however, Bennett (a white candidate) won with 99% of\nthe black vote. I will therefore count him as a successful minority-\npreferred candidate. However, Morris (a black candidate) lost the\ngeneral election, though he got 57% of the black vote. Although Mor-\nris is a minority and received a majority of the minority vote, I will\nnonetheless presume that he is not a minority-preferred candidate\nbecause Bennett received significantly higher support. Therefore, as\nof 1986 we should presume that there had been seven minority-\npreferred candidates, two who were elected and five who were not.\n\nThe 1992 Election:\n\nIn the 1992 Democratic primary, Torain (a black candidate)\nreceived 74% of the black vote in the primary but was not nominated.\nNo one other candidate received a majority of the black vote. I thus\npresume that Torain was the only minority-preferred candidate in\n1992.\n\nIn total, therefore, we should presume that there have been eight\nminority-preferred candidates, two who were elected and six who\nwere not. Accordingly, based only upon the election data proffered,\nI believe that the County is not entitled to summary judgment. See\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 75 (\"the language ofยง2 and its legislative history\nplainly demonstrate that proof that some minority candidates have\nbeen elected does not foreclose a ยง2 claim\"). And, I reemphasize, this\nanalysis only shows which candidate (whether black or white) the\ncourt should presume to be minority preferred. An individual determi-\nnation as to each candidate should be made after trial to ensure that\nall minority-preferred candidates have been properly identified.\n\n                     61\n\f****\n\nIt is no doubt true that we may not (and should not) simply assume\nthat \"`voters of a particular race, because of their race, \"think alike,\nshare the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates\nat the polls\".'\" Ante at 29 (quoting Miller v. Johnson, 115 S. Ct. 2475,\n2486 (1995) (quoting Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 647 (1993))).\nSome black voters may prefer white candidates, some white voters\nmay prefer black candidates, and most voters (I would hope) may not\ncare if their preferred candidate is black or white. Still, a particular\nvoting system may work to prevent black voters from having the\nsame opportunity to elect their chosen representatives as white voters,\nand such a system violates the law. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 652 (recog-\nnizing that a vote dilution claim is \"analytically distinct\" from a claim\nthat the state has used race as a basis for separating voters into dis-\ntricts). Accord Miller, 115 S. Ct. at 2485-86.11\n\nHere, the plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence to defeat the\nCounty's motion for summary judgment because that evidence shows\n_________________________________________________________________\n11 Evidently, however, under the views expressed in the concurring\nopinion such a system would not violate the law. Of course, to reach that\nconclusion we would have to read the Voting Rights Act out of exis-\ntence, something I do not believe that the Supreme Court has done in\nBush v. Vera, 116 S. Ct. 1941 (1996), Shaw, supra, or Miller, supra.\nIndeed, I know of nothing unconstitutional about Congress forbidding\nelectoral schemes that \"are not equally open\" and that operate to provide\nminority members with \"less opportunity than other members of the elec-\ntorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives\nof their choice.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b). Likewise, there is nothing uncon-\nstitutional about requiring the trial court \"to consider the totality of the\ncircumstances and to determine, based upon a searching practical evalua-\ntion of the past and present reality, whether the political process is\nequally open to minority voters.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (citation and\ninternal quotes omitted). While we, as the appellate court, might there-\nfore be faced with hard questions on review (though I doubt that they are\n\"impenetrable\" ones), we must nonetheless decide whether the trial court\nhas correctly followed the law -- even when it is a law that we might\nthink unwise or unnecessary in today's world. And I must respectfully\ndiffer with my concurring colleague if he regards that as an \"intensely\nrace-conscious approach.\" See ante at 32.\n\n                     62\n\fthat a genuine question of fact exists as to whether the at-large\nmethod for electing commissioners in Alamance County deprives\nblack voters of the same opportunity to elect representatives of choice\nas is enjoyed by white voters. The County may ultimately prevail on\nthat question, but without a trial neither we, nor the County, nor the\ncitizens of Alamance will know. Again, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                    63\n\f",

For\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nI.\n\nAlamance County is governed by a Board of Commissioners, the\nfive members of which are elected, in at-large partisan elections, to\nfour-year staggered terms. Voters are allowed to cast votes for as\nmany candidates as there are vacant seats, but they cannot cast more\nthan one vote for any one candidate. Since the 1965 passage of the\nVoting Rights Act, black candidates have run for seats on the Board\nin eight of fourteen election cycles. Only one black candidate, Jack\nO'Kelley, has been elected, although he was elected three times, in\n\n                    2\n\f1974 (after first being appointed to fill a vacancy), 1976, and 1980.\nMoreover, white candidates supported by a majority (often substan-\ntial) of black voters, either in the primary election, the general elec-\ntion, or both, have repeatedly won election.1\n\nSection 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits a State or\nits political subdivisions from imposing any voting practice \"in a\nmanner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1973(a). Section 2(b) of the Act, as amended in 1982, further\nprovides that a violation of ยง 2(a) occurs,\n\n          if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the\n          political processes leading to nomination or election in the\n          State or political subdivision are not equally open to partici-\n          pation by members of a class of citizens protected by sub-\n          section (a) of this section in that its members have less\n          opportunity than other members of the electorate to partici-\n          pate in the political process and to elect representatives of\n          their choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b) (emphasis added).2\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 The census data of 1990 shows that Alamance County's population\nis 79.8% white, 19.2% black. Voting age population is 81.2% white,\n18.0% black. As of April 1994, the population of registered voters was\n84.1% white, 15.5% black. While 59% of all registered voters in the\ncounty are Democrats, blacks in Alamance County are overwhelmingly\nDemocrats (94%). For this latter reason, when we refer to primary elec-\ntions, we are referring only to the Democratic primaries.\n2 The full statute provides as follows:\n\n          (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or stan-\n          dard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any\n          State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a\n          denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United\n          States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of\n          the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as pro-\n          vided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n          (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established\n          if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the\n\n                     3\n\fIn Thornburg v.

The relevant correlation\nfor vote dilution claims, however, is that between the race of the voters\nand the votes cast for a particular candidate, not that between the racial\ncomposition of precincts and the votes cast for a particular candidate, for\nit is only the former from which one can accurately estimate actual voter\npreferences. One can derive estimates of voter preferences from the\nregressions employed here only by assuming that the level of minority\nsupport for the candidate is fairly constant across precincts -- an \"eco-\nlogical\" assumption that runs counter to the common sense observation\nthat blacks and whites who live in integrated neighborhoods are more\nlikely to vote for candidates of another race. See, e.g., Bernard Grofman\net al., Minority Representation and the Quest for Voting Equality 89\n(1992) (\"The principal disadvantage [of ecological regression is] the pos-\nsibility of errors owing to ecological inference.\"); id. (\"[T]he `ecological\nfallacy' . . . is the error of attributing the average behavior of voters in\na given geographic area (ecological unit) to all voters in that area.\"). In\nother words, the bivariate ecological regression analysis merely assumes\nthat which it is the purpose of the analysis to prove -- political cohesive-\nness and constancy of candidate preference among minority voters and\nracial bloc voting among majority voters.

After reviewing the voter prefer-\nence estimates from plaintiffs' expert on these selected elections, the\ndistrict court held that plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence suffi-\ncient to satisfy the third Gingles element, because they had not shown\nthat black-preferred candidates were usually defeated. Based upon the\nlimited data before the court, this conclusion was fully supported even\nby plaintiffs' own expert witness, who admitted during his deposition\nthat twenty of the thirty-one candidates \"generally preferred\" by black\nvoters in the select number of elections he analyzed won election or\nnomination, thirteen of twenty-two \"strongly preferred\" candidates\nwon election or nomination, and eleven of the seventeen \"strongest\npreferred\" candidates won election or nomination. If only the five\ngeneral elections analyzed by plaintiffs' expert are considered, eight\nof the eleven candidates most strongly preferred by black voters were\nelected to seats on the Board.\n\nPlaintiffs advance on appeal four arguments as to why the district\ncourt's conclusion was in error. We reject plaintiffs' claim that those\nwhite candidates who received overwhelming support from black vot-\ners in general elections, assertedly only because they were Democrats,\nshould not have been considered as black-preferred candidates by the\ndistrict court. And we also reject plaintiffs' argument that the district\ncourt erred in not discounting the repeated success of one of the\nminority-preferred candidates because of the alleged effects of incum-\nbency. We agree with plaintiffs, however, that the district court\nimproperly aggregated primary and general election results, and also\nthat it failed to conduct an individualized determination into whether\nsome candidates should be treated as black-preferred candidates.\nAdditionally, we conclude that the district court erred in a third\nrespect, by basing its decision exclusively on data from elections in\nwhich a black candidate was on the ballot, rather than on a more rep-\nresentative sample of elections. By limiting its consideration to elec-\ntions in which a candidate of the minority's race was on the ballot,\nthe district court may have failed to include as black-preferred candi-\ndates some white candidates who may very well have been the repre-\nsentatives of choice of the black community.\n\n                     6\n\fII.\n\nTurning first to what we perceive to be the overarching error, we\nbelieve that, by considering only elections in which a black candidate\nwas on the ballot, the district court failed to analyze a sufficient num-\nber of elections to enable it to determine whether white bloc voting\nusually operates to defeat minority-preferred candidates. As noted, the\ndistrict court considered only election data from eleven of the twenty-\neight primary and general elections held since passage of the Voting\nRights Act -- six of fourteen primary elections and only five of four-\nteen general elections. Although we recognize that this election data\nwas the only data proffered by plaintiffs, we believe that, without a\nlarger, more representative sample of elections, the district court sim-\nply did not have before it sufficient evidence to determine whether the\nblack-preferred candidates usually were defeated,4 unless one is will-\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 We do not imply that the third Gingles element is met if plaintiffs\nmerely show that white bloc voting defeats the minority-preferred candi-\ndate more often than not. The terms used by the Gingles Court are \"usu-\nally,\" \"normally,\" and \"generally.\" 478 U.S. at 49, 51, 56.

The only possible interpretation of this unambiguous language\nis that Section 2 prohibits any election procedure which operates to\ndeny to minorities an equal opportunity to elect those candidates\nwhom they prefer, whether or not those candidates are themselves of\nthe minority race. As Justice Brennan observed in Gingles, \"it is the\nstatus of the candidate as the chosen representative of a particular\nracial group, not the race of the candidate,\" which is relevant in\ndetermining whether Gingles' third precondition is satisfied. Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 68 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J., joined by Blackmun,\nMarshall, and Stevens, JJ.); see Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937 n.5 (\"The\nquestion is not . . . so simple as how many blacks versus whites were\nelected. The court must examine the parties' studies of voting prefer-\nences to determine which were the preferred candidates of the major-\nity and minority communities.\"); see also Lani Guinier, The Triumph\nof Tokenism: The Voting Rights Act and the Theory of Black Electoral\nSuccess, 89 MICH.

That is, a minority-preferred candidate may be a non-\nminority, just as a minority candidate may be the preferred candidate\nof the voters of the majority's race. The black community may prefer\na white candidate, as the white community may prefer a black candi-\ndate. A Martin Luther King, Jr. or a Colin Powell can represent white\nAmericans, no less than a John Fitzgerald Kennedy or a Hubert Hum-\nphrey can represent black Americans.

They themselves conducted a bivariate regression analysis on the\neleven elections in which a black candidate was on the ballot pre-\ncisely in order to determine whether the black candidate or the white\ncandidate was the minority-preferred candidate in those elections.\nHad they not believed, as we do, that a white candidate may be the\nminority-preferred candidate, then they would have advanced their\nclaim solely on the basis that only one black candidate had actually\nwon in these elections. To conduct a regression analysis with respect\nto a black-white election, ostensibly in part to identify the black-\npreferred candidate, makes sense only if it is possible for the preferred\ncandidate not to be the black candidate.\n\nWe recognize that the plaintiffs' expert in Gingles had only ana-\nlyzed elections in which a black candidate had appeared on the ballot,\nsee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 52, and that the Court there relied upon that\ndata in invalidating North Carolina's at-large election scheme. The\nCourt in Gingles, however, never addressed the question of whether\nplaintiffs' exclusion of evidence from white-white races rendered\ntheir proffer insufficient; it merely assumed for purposes of that case\nthat the black candidates there were the representatives of choice of\nblack voters. Justice Brennan, in fact, could not have been clearer in\nthis regard:\n\n          Because both minority and majority voters often select\n          members of their own race as their preferred representatives,\n          it will frequently be the case that a black candidate is the\n          choice of blacks, while a white candidate is the choice of\n\n                     10\n\f          whites. . . . Indeed, the facts of this case illustrate that ten-\n          dency -- blacks preferred black candidates, whites preferred\n          white candidates. Thus, as a matter of convenience, we and\n          the District Court may refer to the preferred representative\n          of black voters as the \"black candidate\" and to the preferred\n          representative of white voters as the \"white candidate.\"\n          Nonetheless, the fact that race of voter and race of candi-\n          date is often correlated is not directly pertinent to a ยง 2\n          inquiry.

But it does not include election\ndata from the 1974 primary election, notwithstanding that the two\nDemocrats elected in the primary for the two full-term seats, both of\nwhom were white, each received 99+% of the black vote in the gen-\neral election. Although it may well be that either or both of these can-\ndidates were the minority-preferred candidates in the 1974 primary,\nand therefore would have counted as minority-preferred electoral suc-\ncesses (both did receive a majority of black support in other primary\n_________________________________________________________________\n8 We do not decide here the extent to which, if any, white-white elec-\ntions are deserving of less evidentiary weight than elections in which a\nminority candidate is on the ballot. It seems to us, however, that if white-\nwhite elections are entitled to less weight, then they are so only on the\nquestion of whether racial polarization exists, not on the question of\nwhether, because of that polarization, minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated. Cf. Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1382 (distinguishing between\n\"racial cohesiveness,\" the second Gingles precondition, and \"racial polar-\nization, . . . the essential element of the third Gingles precondition,\" and\nholding that in measuring whether racial polarization \"permits the major-\nity usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidates,\" evidence such\nas \"elections in which there was no African-American candidate [on the\nballot] . . . become[s] relevant.\").\n\n                    15\n\felections -- Long received 84% in 1972, and Newlin 60%, in 1978),\nit could be that neither was a minority-preferred candidate in the 1974\nprimary, in which case there were uncounted minority-preferred\ndefeats.\n\nSimilarly, the record does not include election results from the\n1972 or 1978 general elections, although Long was successful in the\n1972 primary with 84% of the black vote (second only to the 98%\nreceived by Morris, a black candidate), and Newlin was successful in\nthe 1978 primary with 60% of the black vote (second only to the 78%\nreceived by black candidate Harris). Based upon the record data from\nother general elections, it may be that both of these candidates\nreceived near unanimous support of the black community in their gen-\neral elections, and thus should have been considered the black-\npreferred candidates in those elections. But, without the data from\nthese elections, it simply cannot be known whether they, or others,\nwere the black-preferred candidates, and therefore whether the black-\npreferred candidates were successful or defeated.\n\nAnd there are no election returns, general or primary, for the 1966,\n1968, 1970, 1982, 1988, or 1990 election cycles. The district court\ntherefore likewise could not have known who were the representa-\ntives of choice of black voters in those elections, or whether or not\nthey were defeated.\n\nIn making these observations, we do not suggest that the district\ncourt need analyze every election since 1965 in order to determine\nwhether the minority-preferred candidates are usually defeated.

Rather, we conclude the district court erred in plaintiffs'\nfavor by not treating as \"black-preferred\" some successful candidates\nwho placed second or third among black voters (and with a significant\n\n                     17\n\fmajority of black votes) behind an unsuccessful candidate who was\nthe first choice of black voters.\n\n1.\n\nBecause Alamance County's Board of Commissioners is elected\nfrom a single, multi-member district, citizens are permitted to vote for\neither two or three candidates in both the primary and general elec-\ntions, depending on the number of seats up for election in any given\nyear. Consequently, the district court in most cases treated the top two\nor three vote-recipients among black voters as the black-preferred\ncandidates, as did plaintiffs' expert. If the first choice of black voters\ndid not win an election, however, the district court excluded from\nconsideration even as possible minority-preferred candidates those\ncandidates who placed second or third among black voters behind the\nlosing black-preferred candidate, in attempted reliance on our opinion\nin Collins II, 883 F.2d at 1238. In so doing, the district court, as even\ncounsel for the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument, seems to have\nmisread our opinion in Collins II. We did not, in Collins II, adopt a\nper se rule against considering, as minority-preferred, candidates who\nfinished second or third among minority voters behind an unsuccess-\nful candidate who was the minority community's first choice. We\nheld only that,\n\n          [t]he mere election of a candidate who appears to have\n          received votes from more than fifty percent of minority bal-\n          lots does not count as a minority electoral success, when\n          each ballot may contain votes for more than one candidate.\n          In such a situation, if there were other candidates, preferred\n          by a significantly higher percentage of the minority commu-\n          nity, who were defeated in the same election, then it cannot\n          be fairly said that the minority community has successfully\n          elected representatives of its choice. Each such situation\n          must be reviewed individually to determine whether the\n          elected candidates can be fairly considered as representa-\n          tives of the minority community. The presumption must be\n          that they cannot if some other candidate has received\n          significantly more minority votes.\n\nId. at 1238 (emphases added) (quoting Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937).\n\n                     18\n\fCollins II, in other words, requires that a two-step inquiry be\nundertaken by the court in order to determine whether candidates who\nreceive less support from black voters than an unsuccessful first\nchoice may nevertheless be deemed black-preferred candidates in\nmulti-seat elections. First, if the unsuccessful candidate who was the\nfirst choice among minority voters did not receive a\"significantly\nhigher percentage\" of the minority community's support than did\nother candidates who also received a majority among minority voters,\nCollins II, 883 F.2d at 1238 (quoting Collins I, 816 F.2d at 937); see\nalso id. at 1239 (referring to the level of support given to the unsuc-\ncessful candidate as \"much greater\"), then the latter should also be\nviewed by the district court as minority-preferred candidates. Cf.\nNiagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1018 (treating as black-preferred a candi-\ndate who finished behind an unsuccessful first choice among black\nvoters whose support \"was not dramatically higher.\"). Second, if the\nlevel of support received by the unsuccessful first-place finisher\namong black voters was \"significantly higher\" than the support given\nthe second- and third-place finishers by those same voters, then suc-\ncessful candidates who finished behind the unsuccessful first choice\n\"are presumed not to be the minority's preferred candidates or repre-\nsentatives of choice.\" Id. at 1238. Even so, the district court must still\nreview \"[e]ach such situation . . . individually to determine whether\nthe elected candidates can be fairly considered as representatives of\nthe minority community.\" Id. This is to say that Collins II requires an\nindividualized determination in the circumstance where the unsuc-\ncessful first choice of black voters received significantly more support\nthan the next-place finishers of the black voters. In this circumstance,\nthe individualized determination is undertaken in order to ensure that\nthe second- or third-place finishers, who, based upon their substantial\nsupport from the minority community would seem to be minority-\npreferred candidates, may in fact fairly be characterized as such.\n\nIn this case, black candidate Morris, for example, received 98% of\nthe black vote in the 1972 Democratic primary election, and white\ncandidates Long, Fleming, and Horne received 84%, 29%, and 16%\nof the black vote, respectively.9 Long, Fleming, and Horne won the\nprimary election. Notwithstanding the impressive support that Long\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Three other white candidates received 9%, 8% and 5% of the black\nvote, respectively.\n\n                     19\n\freceived from black voters in the primary, the district court did not\neven consider whether Long might have been a black-preferred candi-\ndate. Because Morris' support among black voters was not \"signifi-\ncantly higher\" than Long's, the district court appears to have erred in\nnot automatically treating Long as a black-preferred candidate. But\neven had Morris' level of support among black voters been signifi-\ncantly higher than Long's, the district court still would have erred in\nnot making an individualized determination before rejecting Long as\na black-preferred candidate.\n\nMorris' support was significantly higher than the 29% received by\nFleming. In such a circumstance, as in the case directly addressed by\nCollins II,10 a presumption against viewing Fleming as black-\npreferred is required by our holding in Collins II, which, as a panel,\nwe are bound by. However, the district court should have made an\nindividualized determination to assess whether that candidate, too,\ncould properly have been deemed black-preferred.\n\nThe district court also declined to treat successful white candidate\nNewlin as a black-preferred candidate in the 1978 Democratic pri-\nmary, merely because Harris, the first choice of black voters, lost.\nThere were two seats up for election that year, and Harris and Newlin\nwere the top two vote-recipients among black voters, by far, with an\nestimated 78% and 60% of the black vote, respectively. Significantly,\nthe third place finisher among black voters was a black candidate,\nwho received only 12% of the black vote. Even were we to conclude\nthat Harris' support among black voters was \"significantly higher\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n10 Our holding in Collins II actually does not address this circumstance\ndirectly, since Fleming received less than majority support among black\nvoters; Collins II addressed only the circumstance where a candidate\nreceives more than 50% of the minority community's vote. Nevertheless,\nwe do not believe that the mere failure to achieve a threshold of 50% in\na multi-candidate election necessarily means that a candidate cannot be\nviewed as a black-preferred candidate. If the election had been held only\namong black voters, a hypothetical inquiry given some credence by the\nGingles plurality, see 478 U.S. at 68 (\"The essence of a submergence\nclaim is that minority group members prefer certain candidates whom\nthey could elect\" if the election were held in a majority-black district),\nthen Fleming would have won, because he was the third-place finisher\namong black voters in an election in which three seats were to be filled.\n\n                    20\n\fthan Newlin's, an individualized determination would still have been\nrequired before declining to treat Newlin as a black-preferred candi-\ndate. Again, we held in Collins II only that successful candidates who\nreceive more than 50% of the black vote should not automatically be\nviewed as a black-preferred candidate if they receive significantly less\nsupport from black voters than another, losing candidate, not that they\nshould never be treated as black-preferred.\n\n2.\n\nWhile the district court erred in automatically excluding, as possi-\nble minority-preferred candidates, the second- and third-place finish-\ners behind an unsuccessful first choice among black voters, we do not\nbelieve the court erred, as plaintiffs contend, in not conducting an\nindividualized determination with respect to every candidate who fin-\nished second or third among black voters behind successful black-\npreferred candidates, before treating them as black-preferred. Plain-\ntiffs object to the fact that the district court considered some of the\nsecond and/or third place finishers as black-preferred in the three pri-\nmary elections in which the first choice of black voters was successful\n-- 1976, 1980, and 1984. In the 1976 primary, for example, the dis-\ntrict court treated both successful black candidate O'Kelley, who won\n99+% of the black vote, and successful white candidate Fleming, who\nfinished second among black voters with 47% of the vote, as black-\npreferred. The district court did not, however, consider successful\nwhite candidate Paris as black-preferred because he received only\n16% of the black vote, even though that percentage placed him in a\ntie for third among black voters and thus may have been sufficient to\nwin had the election been held only among black voters. See supra\nnote 10. All three candidates went on to win in the general election,\nwith 99+% of the black community's vote.\n\nPlaintiffs object to the district court's treatment of these second and\nthird place finishers as black-preferred candidates on the ground that,\n\"[i]n most of these elections, . . . the black community fielded only\none [black] candidate,\" Appellant's Br. at 20. In advancing this argu-\nment, plaintiffs rely not on the holding in Collins II, but on a single\npassage from that case in which we said the following:\n\n          If black voters exercised their right to cast all of their allot-\n          ted votes, they ran the risk that their second and third\n\n                     21\n\f          choices would be declared their preferred candidates. Only\n          by single-shot voting -- withholding all votes save for their\n          first choice, and forfeiting the opportunity to cast all votes\n          allotted to each voter -- could the minority be assured that\n          its second and third choices would not be declared its pre-\n          ferred candidates. In contrast, under the at-large system, the\n          white voters can freely cast all votes allotted to them with-\n          out suffering the penalty imposed on the minority voters.\n\n883 F.2d at 1239-40. Because Collins II, as explained above,\naddressed only the treatment of second- and third-place finishers\nbehind an unsuccessful, not a successful, minority-preferred candi-\ndate, this passage is obviously dictum and not controlling here. And\neven were it applicable, the passage does not suggest the level of sup-\nport necessary in order for such candidates to be considered minority-\npreferred.\n\nWe believe that it would be unwise to extend the holding in Collins II\nto instances in which the first choice among black voters was success-\nful. Where the first choice of black voters was successful, there is\nsimply no reason to presume that the minority community has been\nunsuccessful in electing representatives of its choice. Accordingly, we\nnow hold that, in multi-seat elections in which voters are permitted\nto cast as many votes as there are seats, at the very least any candidate\nwho receives a majority of the minority vote and who finishes behind\na successful candidate who was the first choice among the minority\nvoters is automatically to be deemed a black-preferred candidate, just\nlike the successful first choice. Cf. Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1018\nn.18 (noting that parties did not dispute that candidates who received\nmore than 50% were black-preferred). Candidates who receive less\nthan 50% of the minority vote, but who would have been elected had\nthe election been held only among black voters, are presumed also to\nbe minority-preferred candidates, although an individualized assess-\nment should be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may\nappropriately be so considered.\n\nThe district court appears generally to have conducted its analysis\nin the manner that we have described as appropriate. It considered as\nblack-preferred candidates only those candidates who received sub-\n\n                     22\n\fstantial support from black voters;11 it did not unquestioningly denom-\ninate as black-preferred the top two or three vote-recipients among the\nblack community. Moreover, the court seems to have made an indi-\nvidualized determination before considering, as black-preferred, can-\ndidates such as Fleming who, in 1976, received slightly less than 50%\nof the black vote (47%), and in rejecting Paris, who in that same elec-\ntion only tied for third, with 16% of the black vote. We accordingly\ndiscern no reason to disturb the district court's determinations with\nrespect to those candidates who finished second and third among\nminority voters, behind the minority community's successful first\nchoice. Those determinations are not clearly erroneous. See Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 77-79.\n\nB.\n\nPlaintiffs next object to the fact that the district court treated, as\nblack-preferred, Democratic candidates who received 99+% of the\nblack vote in general elections. Plaintiffs contend that to consider\nthese candidates as black-preferred ignores that blacks in Alamance\nCounty overwhelmingly support Democrats in partisan elections.\nThey argue that Democrats should be treated as black-preferred only\nif they were also black-preferred in the primary election. Therefore,\nthey would have us discount, for example, the general election victo-\nries of Fleming in 1976 and Paris in 1980, both of whom received\nnearly unanimous black voter support, merely because they received\n\"only\" 47% and 48%, respectively, of the black vote in the primary\nelections. This argument is flawed in two fundamental respects.\n\nFirst, as we discuss infra, acceptance of this argument would\nrequire that we carry forward the candidates' black-preferred status\nfrom the primary to the general election, when the Voting Rights Act\nis clearly concerned with whether blacks have an equal opportunity\nto elect the candidate of their choice in both nominations and elec-\ntions. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973(b) (\"A violation . . . is established if . . .\nit is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\nelection . . . are not equally open to participation by [citizens on\n_________________________________________________________________\n11 The level of support that may properly be deemed \"substantial\" will\nvary, of course, depending on the number of candidates on the ballot and\nthe number of seats to be filled.\n\n                    23\n\faccount of race or color].\" (emphasis added)); cf.

Thus, candidates who receive 99+% of the black\nvote in general elections are the black-preferred candidate in that\nelection, regardless of their level of support in the primary. We reject\nthe proposition that \"success of a minority-preferred candidate in a\ngeneral election is entitled to less weight when a candidate with far\ngreater [minority] support was defeated in the primary.\" Niagara\nFalls, 65 F.3d at 1018. Such a view is grounded in the belief that\nminority voters essentially take their marbles and go home whenever\nthe candidate whom they prefer most in the primary does not prevail,\na belief about minority voters that we do not share. And such a view\nignores altogether the possibility that primary election winners will\nbecome the minority's preferred candidate during the general election\ncampaign, or that where, as here, the overwhelming majority of\nblacks vote in the Democratic primary, that a Republican could in fact\nbecome the black-preferred candidate in the general election by\naddressing himself to issues of interest to the minority community in\na way that appeals to them as participants in the political process.\n\nSecond, under plaintiffs' theory, the district court would be\nrequired, contrary to Gingles, to assess the cause of the minority com-\nmunity's support of the candidate in determining whether the\nminority-preferred candidates usually are defeated by white bloc vot-\ning. See infra note 12. In Gingles, defendants argued that the plaintiffs\nwere required to use multiple regression analysis, rather than bivariate\nregression analysis, to ensure that only those defeats of black-\npreferred candidates that were actually caused by race, and not some\nother reason such as party affiliation, were considered defeats of\nblack-preferred candidates for purposes of a vote dilution claim. The\nGingles plurality explicitly rejected such a requirement in the context\n\n                     24\n\fof assessing the second and third Gingles preconditions. 478 U.S. at\n62.12\n\nMoreover, even the limited election data in this record demonstrate\nthat black voters do not vote monolithically, even in partisan general\nelections. White Democrats Holt and Thompson only received 69%\nand 83% of the black vote, respectively, in the 1984 general election,\nand Democrat Morris, who is black, received only 57% of the black\nvote in the 1986 general election -- behind Democrat Bennett, who\nis white, who received 99+% of the black vote.\n_________________________________________________________________\n12 Although only a four-Member plurality joined Section III(C) of the\nopinion, in which the rejection of defendant's multiple regression claim\nis found, Section III(C) is lengthy, and the dispute that cost Justice\nWhite's vote on the section was not over the \"cause\" issue.\n\nAlthough most of our sister circuits have by now adopted the position\nthat an inquiry into cause is relevant, see, e.g., LULAC, 999 F.2d at 850\n(\"[The] rigorous protections [of the Voting Rights Act], as the text of ยง 2\nsuggests, extend only to defeats experienced by voters `on account of\nrace or color.'\"), they are still in disagreement about the stage in the vote\ndilution inquiry in which causation evidence is appropriate, compare\nNipper, 39 F.3d at 1515 (\"[I]f the evidence shows, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, that the community is not motivated by racial bias in\nits voting patterns, then a case of vote dilution has not been made.\") with\nClarke, 40 F.3d at 812-14 (considering \"cause\" of the success rate of\nblack-preferred candidates in assessing third Gingles element). We think\nthe best reading of the several opinions in Gingles, however, is one that\ntreats causation as irrelevant in the inquiry into the three Gingles precon-\nditions, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 62 (Brennan, J., plurality opinion), but\nrelevant in the totality of circumstances inquiry, see 478 U.S. at 100\n(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (agreeing that use of racial polar-\nization data \"solely\" to prove Gingles second and third elements cannot\nbe rebutted by \"evidence that the divergent racial voting patterns may be\nexplained in part by causes other than race,\" but disagreeing with plurali-\nty's claim \"that such evidence can never affect the overall vote dilution\ninquiry.\").\n\nOf course, whether causation is relevant to the second and third pre-\ncondition inquiries or to the totality of circumstances inquiry, it would\nbe just as relevant for determining whether particular minority-preferred\ncandidates lose for some reason other than racial polarization, as it would\nbe for determining, as plaintiffs urge, whether particular minority-\npreferred candidates win merely because of party affiliation.\n\n                     25\n\fWe therefore hold that the district court properly deemed all gen-\neral election candidates who received 99+% of the black community's\nvote as black-preferred, without reference to the underlying primary\nelection.\n\nC.\n\nPlaintiffs next contend that the district court erred in not distin-\nguishing between, and separately analyzing, primaries and general\nelections, in determining whether black-preferred candidates were\n\"usually\" successful. With this contention, we agree.\n\nSection 2(b) of the Voting Rights Act provides that a violation\noccurs if \"the political processes leading to nomination or election . . .\nare not equally open\" to all voters. 42 U.S.C.ยง 1973(b) (emphasis\nadded); see also 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973l(c)(1) (\"The terms `vote' or `vot-\ning' shall include all action necessary to make a vote effective in any\nprimary, special, or general election . . . .\"). The statute thus requires\nthat minorities have an equal opportunity to participate not only in\nprimary elections but also in general elections. From this, we believe\nit follows that the results in these two phases of the single election\ncycle must be separately considered and analyzed, and, in recognition\nof this statutory requirement, that Gingles' third precondition can be\nsatisfied by proof that, in either the primary or the general election,\nthe minority-preferred candidate is usually defeated by white bloc\nvoting. Not to separately consider primary and general elections risks\nmasking regular defeat in one of these phases with repeated successes\nin the other, and thereby misperceiving a process that is palpably in\nviolation of the Voting Rights Act, as not violative of the Act at all.\n\nBy way of illustration, an at-large voting method under which the\ncandidates preferred by the minority community are always success-\nful in the primary election but, because of white bloc voting, are\nalways defeated in the general election (or one in which minority-\npreferred candidates are essentially barred from the general election\nballot because of racial-bloc voting in the primary, see White v.\nRegester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108826\"><a href=\"/opinion/108826/white-v-regester/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (1973) (\"[T]he black community has\nbeen effectively excluded from participation in the Democratic pri-\nmary selection process.\")), is a voting method under which minorities\nare, because of white bloc voting, always unsuccessful in attaining\n\n                     26\n\felective office. By aggregating primary and general elections, how-\never, a court would ineluctably find in both circumstances that\nminority-preferred candidates were successful fifty percent of the\ntime, and therefore not \"usually\" defeated by white bloc voting.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held, in an analogous context, that courts\nmust not rely on \"aggregated\" data \"when considering several sepa-\nrate vote dilution challenges in a single case.\" See Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 59 n.28; see also id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\"The District Court clearly erred in aggregating data from all of the\nchallenged districts . . . .\"). Because plaintiffs' challenge is, in reality,\ntwo separate vote dilution challenges -- one to the at-large primary\nelection scheme, and one to the at-large general election scheme --\nwe believe that like reasoning must obtain here. Accordingly, we hold\nthat primary and general election results should not be aggregated for\npurposes of determining whether black-preferred candidates are \"usu-\nally\" successful, and that the district court erred in so doing. Because\nplaintiffs in this case would not prevail on their Section 2 claim even\nwere the primaries and general elections considered separately, how-\never, we will not reverse the district court on account of this error.\n\nD.\n\nPlaintiffs' final claim is that the district court erred in not discount-\ning the weight attributed to O'Kelley's electoral successes because he\nwas an incumbent. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (\"[S]pecial circum-\nstances, such as the absence of an opponent, incumbency, or the utili-\nzation of bullet voting, may explain minority electoral success in a\npolarized contest.\" (emphasis added)); but see Smith, 687 F. Supp. at\n1317 (\"The materiality of [evidence of incumbency] is questionable.\"\n(citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 63 (plurality opinion))). O'Kelley, one of\nthe successful black-preferred candidates whom the district court con-\nsidered in determining whether black-preferred candidates usually\nwere defeated, won three straight general elections (and, apparently,\n5 elections total, including primaries) after first being appointed to a\nvacant seat. Although the district court provided no explanation of its\ndecision not to discount O'Kelley's successes, we will not disturb that\ndecision, given that plaintiffs' own expert did not analyze the effects\nof incumbency for O'Kelley or for any other candidate. To reverse as\nclearly erroneous the district court's decision under these circum-\n\n                      27\n\fstances would be to transform what was at most a narrow or \"special\"\ncircumstance envisioned by the Court only in dicta into a categorical\nrule that all electoral successes of a minority-preferred incumbent are\nto be discounted. See, e.g., Clarke, 40 F.3d at 813-14 (\"[I]ncumbency\nplays a significant role in the vast majority of American elections. To\nqualify as a `special' circumstance, then, incumbency must play an\nunusually important role in the election at issue; a contrary rule would\nconfuse the ordinary with the special, and thus`make practically\nevery American election a \"special circumstance.\"'\" (quoting Collins\nII, 883 F.2d at 1250 (Chapman, J., dissenting)). Of course, as the\ndefendants point out, and as counsel for the plaintiffs conceded at\nargument, \"if incumbency were to be considered to discount the\nweight to be given to the success of one black candidate, O'Kelley,\nit likewise would have to be used to discount the weight given to the\ndefeat of other black candidates who lost to incumbents, such as Har-\nris in 1978 and Freeman in 1984.\" Appellee's Br. at 24, citing Nipper\nv.

The Act's purpose is not\nto ensure the election of candidates of the minority's race, nor is it to\nensure the election of candidates of any particular political party. In\nguaranteeing that minorities will be afforded an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in the political processes and to elect representatives of\n\"their choice,\" the Act at once embodies the presumption and\nembraces the ideal that, in this Country, a candidate of any color can\nrepresent citizens of all colors, that a candidate of either party can\nrepresent the interests of all parties. Few presumptions are more fun-\ndamental to our system of representative democracy or more reveal-\ning of our commitment to equality and individual autonomy.\n\nAt bottom, through their collective arguments, plaintiffs urge a\nreading of the Supreme Court's decision in Gingles, and therefore an\ninterpretation of Section 2, that would be \"at war\" with this funda-\nmental presumption, this ideal, which we believe not only informed\nCongress' enactment of Section 2, but underlay the Court's interpreta-\n\n                     28\n\ftion of that provision in Gingles. The reading of Gingles urged upon\nus would not simply guarantee to minority voters an equal opportu-\nnity to elect representatives of their choice, but would require the\nelection of minority candidates: \"Under the law, black voters must\nhave an opportunity not just to elect candidates of their choice, but to\nelect black candidates of their choice.\" Appellant's Br. at 30. Such an\ninterpretation, of course, is grounded ultimately in the twin presump-\ntions that all members of a particular racial group will always prefer\nthe same candidate and that that preferred candidate will always be\nof that group's race. We simply disagree that Gingles requires, or\neven permits, any such presumptions; indeed, we believe Gingles for-\nbids such presumptions based upon race alone. And to the extent it\ncan be read otherwise, we are convinced the Court would not so read\nthe case today, given its unequivocal pronouncements that the princi-\nples of equal protection are offended by \"assumption[s] that voters of\na particular race, because of their race, `think alike, share the same\npolitical interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls'.\"\nMiller v.

If my\ndissenting brother's view of Gingles prevails, we will be well on our\nway to the creation of racially separate electorates and a racially sepa-\nrate society. Nothing in Supreme Court precedent compels us to take\nAmerica in that direction.\n\n                     32\n\fBy reversing the district court, the dissent would lead us not only\nto a relentlessly race-conscious trial, but also toward the restructuring\nof Alamance County electoral districts along racial lines. This is just\nwhat the Supreme Court does not allow. Bush, Shaw, and Miller did\nnot overrule Gingles, but they surely set limits on the ability of fed-\neral courts to cast voters as members of racial blocs rather than as\nindividuals. In order to identify the \"minority-preferred\" candidate,\nwe have been forced to wade into a bog of slippery assumptions and\nstatistics. In this case alone, we have been asked to assault such\nimpenetrable questions as: May a candidate who receives more than\n50% of the minority vote, but who finishes behind a successful\nminority-preferred candidate, also be considered preferred by the\nminority? If the candidate who is most preferred by the minority is\nunsuccessful, may other successful candidates who received substan-\ntial minority support be considered as preferred by the minority?\nShould votes for candidates cast by minority voters in general elec-\ntions be held not to express their true preferences when a candidate\nfavored by minority voters in the primary election failed to win a\nplace on the ballot for the general election? And, should votes for a\nminority-preferred candidate who is also an incumbent be disregarded\nwhen analyzing the successes of minority-preferred candidates?\n\nWhere will this road of race-consciousness end? As the above\nquestions demonstrate, the Gingles inquiry is complicated enough in\na biracial community. Is the inquiry to become ever more refined and\never more complex as America becomes more multicultural? How do\nwe identify minority-preferred candidates under Gingles when multi-\nple minorities are present? How shall we determine whether a candi-\ndate supported to a greater or lesser extent by different minorities is\nthe preferred candidate of a single minority? To what extent are the\nelectoral interests of different racial minorities to be aggregated or\nkept separate? How broadly or narrowly are the categories of racial\nminorities to be defined? At some point, this race-based calculus will\ndemonstrate only how far the law has set us on the path to disunion.\n\nEntering this maze of racially laden inquiries reflects a view of\nAmerican political life as a competition between highly segregated\nracial forces. Indeed, this is precisely the mistake of the dissent. The\ndissent's interpretation of Gingles will not allow courts to accept the\nvotes of minority individuals as expressing their personal preferences.\n\n                     33\n\fInstead, the dissent mandates that we pass the votes of minority indi-\nviduals under a microscope in order to determine the racial prefer-\nences expressed by those voters.\n\nUnder the dissent's view, all electoral behavior is reducible to race.\nThus, the dissent suggests that because voters prefer candidates of\ntheir own race, elections in which no minority was a candidate need\nnot be counted. The dissent further suggests that minority votes for\na candidate in a general election do not express a preference by the\nminority unless that candidate was also preferred by the minority in\nthe primary election; that a successful candidate who received more\nthan 50% of the minority vote, but finished behind a successful candi-\ndate who received a higher degree of minority support, should not\nautomatically be considered to be preferred by the minority; and that\ncertain electoral successes of incumbent, minority-preferred candi-\ndates should not count towards the success of minority individuals in\nelecting their preferred candidate.\n\nAnd these are but a few of the racially-driven factors that the dis-\nsent would fasten upon the judicial review of American elections. In\nits recent cases, the Supreme Court has made it clear that there is no\nroom in the Constitution for congressional redistricting schemes pred-\nicated predominantly on the basis of race. See Bush v. Vera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118040\"><a href=\"/opinion/118040/bush-v-vera/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The dissent's interpretation of Gingles flies in\nthe face of this command by proposing a set of intricate inquiries\ndesigned to reinforce the view of American politics as a contest\nbetween separate racial voting blocs. The tendency of such rules to\n\"disrupt[ ] nonracial bases of political identity,\" Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n1962 (plurality opinion), will be no less than that of drawing district\nboundaries based on race, and they should be no more acceptable\nunder the Constitution. \"It takes a shortsighted and unauthorized view\nof the Voting Rights Act to invoke that statute, which has played a\ndecisive role in redressing some of our worst forms of discrimination,\nto demand the very racial stereotyping the Fourteenth Amendment\nforbids.\" Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2494. In leading us ineluctably to elec-\ntoral remedies based on racial shares, the dissent\"carr[ies] us further\nfrom the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters\n-- a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and\n\n                    34\n\fto which the Nation continues to aspire.\" Shaw v.

A Constitution, however, has its aspirational as\nwell as descriptive aspect. It is informed by the way things ought to\nbe. Were the Fourteenth Amendment no more than a concession to\nthe racial realities of the day, Brown v. Board of Education would\nhave remained an untaken step. Separation of the races is no better for\nAmerica now than it was in 1954. It is a sad turn that has led the\ncourts to rebuild the walls they once brought down.\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nSince 1980 no minority candidate has been elected to Alamance\nCounty's five-member Board of Commissioners. Indeed, since the\nVoting Rights Act was first passed in 1965, only one minority candi-\ndate has ever been elected to the Board of Commissioners. That can-\ndidate was initially appointed (not elected), and when he was first\nelected after his appointment, he ran in a special election that was not\nsubject to Alamance County's at-large voting system. In light of this\nhistory, I believe that members of the black community in Alamance\nCounty would be truly surprised to learn that they enjoy the same\nopportunity as white voters to elect their preferred candidates as\ncounty commissioners. Yet, in light of this same history, the majority\n_________________________________________________________________\n*My good colleague suggests in dissent that the concurring opinion\nfails to follow the law -- \"even when it is a law that we might think\nunwise or unnecessary in today's world.\" Of course, the district court fol-\nlowed the law when it found that the Alamance County system con-\nformed fully to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and did not operate\nto deny black citizens an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their\nchoice. In voting to reverse the district court, it is the dissent, I respect-\nfully suggest, that has failed to follow the law, because it has mandated\na collection of intensely race-conscious inquiries destined to result by\nway of remedy in the proportional allocation of electoral districts based\non race. To pursue this course in the wake of the Supreme Court's\nrepeated cautions against race-conscious districting is simply not sup-\nportable.\n\n                    35\n\fconcludes that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that minority-\npreferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc voting and\naffirms the award of summary judgment to the County.\n\nThe majority offers two main reasons for its decision. First, the\nmajority believes that the plaintiffs have failed to defeat the County's\nmotion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs have not \"prof-\nfer[ed] data from a sufficient number of elections to enable the district\ncourt to determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats\nminority-preferred candidates.\" Ante at 8. That is, because the plain-\ntiffs have not proffered evidence from elections in which no minority\nwas a candidate, the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nThe majority reaches this conclusion even though the plaintiffs have\nproffered election data from every election in which a minority was\na candidate, and even though the Supreme Court in Thornburg v.\nGingles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), upheld a finding of vote dilution based\non an analysis of election data that included results from only those\nelections in which a minority was a candidate and that covered only\nthree election years.\n\nSecond, the majority believes that even if we only consider the\nelection data that the plaintiffs have proffered, the plaintiffs have still\nfailed to establish a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1973. In particular, under the majority's approach for\ndetermining who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, the\nplaintiffs have failed to show that minority voters' preferred candidate\nis usually defeated by white bloc voting. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe majority adopts a methodology that is unsound and unsupported\nby precedent. For example, even though primary election results pro-\nvide a means for assessing minority voter preference without the\neffects of partisanship, under the majority's approach it is improper\nto consider primary election data when determining who is and who\nis not a minority-preferred candidate in the general election. Ante at\n23-24. Thus, according to the majority, we should take raw election\ndata in isolation and disregard the probative value of considering gen-\neral election data in conjunction with primary election data (or in con-\njunction with any other circumstance in most cases).\n\nBecause I believe that neither of the majority's two reasons provide\ngrounds for affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment,\n\n                     36\n\fI respectfully dissent. At the very least, I believe that it is clear that\nthe plaintiffs have offered ample evidence showing that there is a gen-\nuine issue of material fact of whether minority-preferred candidates\nare usually defeated by white bloc voting. Therefore, the district\ncourt's order granting summary judgment should be reversed and the\ncase remanded for trial.\n\nI.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Gingles makes clear that the\nplaintiffs have the burden of proving each of the Court's three precon-\nditions, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48, including whether \"the white\nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it--in the absence of\nspecial circumstances, . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred\ncandidate.\" Id. at 51 (citations omitted). And the plurality opinion of\nJustice Brennan emphasizes that \"it is the status of the candidate as\nthe chosen representative of a particular racial group, not the race of\nthe candidate, that is important.\" Id. at 68 (Brennan, J., plurality opin-\nion) (emphasis in original).1 Yet, the Court's decision in Gingles\nnotes that:\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 Justice Brennan's opinion on this point failed to gain a majority of the\nCourt, and it was joined by only Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Ste-\nvens. Justice White, who otherwise joined Justice Brennan's opinion,\nrejected the notion that the race of the candidate is irrelevant. Id. at 83\n(White, J., concurring). Justice O'Connor, in an opinion joined by Chief\nJustice Burger and Justices Powell and Rehnquist, agreed with Justice\nWhite that race of the candidate might affect the overall vote dilution\ninquiry. Id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Justice White and Justice\nO'Connor were concerned that ignoring the race of the candidate may\ncause the successful election of a black candidate not to be counted for\npurposes of identifying racial polarization. For instance, because black\nvoters often support the Democratic party, there was concern that the\nelection of a black Republican candidate would not be viewed as a\nminority success. See id., 478 U.S. at 83 (White, J., concurring) (\"This\nis interest-group politics rather than a rule hedging against racial discrim-\nination.\"); id. at 101 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing with Justice\nWhite that \"Justice Brennan's conclusion that the race of the candidate\nis always irrelevant in identifying racially polarized voting conflicts with\nWhitcomb [v.

In\ntotal, the plaintiffs proffered election data from five general elections\nand six primary elections extending over twenty years. The election\ndata included the general elections in 1974, 1976, 1980, 1984, and\n1986, and the Democratic primaries in 1972, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984,\nand 1992. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (\"a pattern of racial bloc voting\nthat extends over a period of time is more probative of a claim that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncase turns the opinions of Justice Brennan, Justice White, and Justice\nO'Connor on their collective heads.

Neither before the district\ncourt, nor in its briefs to this court, did the County argue that it was\nentitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs had only ana-\nlyzed elections involving minority candidates. In essence, however,\nthat is what the majority has held here today.\n\nI disagree with this result because I believe that the plaintiffs have\nin fact offered sufficient evidence from which a fair assessment can\nbe made of whether minority-preferred candidates are usually\ndefeated by white bloc voting.

See ante at 5 n.3. If the County\nwishes to challenge the plaintiffs' statistical evidence as flawed, then it\nshould do so, and we should refrain from criticizing the statistical evi-\ndence in the absence of such a challenge. For instance, while it may (or\nmay not) be true that \"blacks and whites who live in integrated neighbor-\nhoods are more likely to vote for candidates of another race,\" id., the\nCounty has put forth no evidence or argument on this appeal that the\nplaintiffs' election data is flawed because it treated minority preference\nas constant across precincts.

And, of course, the majority does not\nexpressly say that is what it is doing here. According to the majority,\nit \"hold[s] merely that it is insufficient to consider selectively only\nthose elections in which minority candidates were on the ballot, at\nleast where such elections are not such a substantial majority of the\ntotal elections that a fair assessment can be made of whether the\nminority-preferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc vot-\ning.\" Ante at 17. Yet, the majority makes clear that it believes that\n\"both elections in which the candidates are of the same race and elec-\ntions in which the candidates are of different races must be considered\nin order to determine whether white bloc voting usually defeats the\nminority-preferred candidate . . . .\" Id. at 9 (emphasis added).\n\nOf course, I agree that there must be sufficient election data pres-\nented from which a \"fair assessment can be made\" of the third\nGingles precondition. I cannot, however, agree that a \"fair assess-\nment\" must be based on data from a \"substantial majority of the total\nelections.\" Nor can I agree that elections in which no minority was\na candidate must be considered in all circumstances.\n\nDespite what the majority believes, there is no requirement under\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act or Supreme Court precedent that\nthe plaintiffs offer election data from \"a substantial majority of the\ntotal elections\" in order to show that minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated by white bloc voting. Likewise, even though \"a\nminority-preferred candidate may be either a minority or a non-\nminority,\" neither section 2 of the Voting Rights Act nor Supreme\nCourt precedent requires, as the majority claims, that we \"must\" con-\nsider (and plaintiffs must proffer) data from elections in which no\nminority was a candidate. See ante at 9. As I have said, not only did\nthe decision in Gingles uphold vote dilution claims based on election\ndata that included only those elections in which a minority was a can-\ndidate, but the Court specifically noted that \"[t]he number of elections\nthat must be studied in order to determine whether voting is polarized\nwill vary according to the pertinent circumstances.\" 468 U.S. at 57\nn.25 (emphasis added).

Also, a court's\nleeway to examine elections in which no minority is a candidate does not\nmean that a court must examine such elections before a vote dilution\nclaim can be established, and it certainly does not mean that a plaintiff\nmust proffer such evidence in all cases (and on summary judgment). Cf.\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129 (\"district court may, in its discretion, decide to\nallow the defendants to introduce evidence on which, if any, white candi-\ndates were minority-preferred\") (emphasis added; footnote omitted).\n\n                     41\n\fthe minority has sponsored such a significant number of white candi-\ndates that a fair assessment can not be made without an analysis of\nelection data from elections in which no minority was a candidate, I\ndo not believe that we may require a plaintiff to proffer election data\nfrom white/white elections before a vote dilution claim can be proven.\n\nIndeed, when the minority's only choice is to vote for a white can-\ndidate or not to vote at all, such elections are, in general, less proba-\ntive on the issue of racial polarization than elections involving both\nblack and white candidates. As the Fifth Circuit has said:\n\n          \"[T]he evidence most probative of racially polarized voting\n          must be drawn from elections including both black and\n          white candidates.\" \"[W]hen there are only white candidates\n          to choose from it is `virtually unavoidable that certain white\n          candidates would be supported by a large percentage . . . of\n          black voters.'\" Thus, it is not particularly surprising--and\n          not particularly probative--that analysis of elections that\n          included only white candidates did not reveal any racial\n          polarization.\n\nWestwego Citizens for Better Gov't v.

Therefore, if the defendant does\nnot bring forth evidence of particular circumstances showing that\nminority voters often choose to sponsor, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n.25,\nand not merely vote for white candidates, I believe that \"a fair assess-\nment can be made\" of the third Gingles precondition without the prof-\nfer of election data from elections in which no minority was a\ncandidate.\n\nA fair assessment is just that, and the plaintiffs in this case have\noffered more than sufficient election data from which we may discern\nelection patterns in Alamance County. The plaintiffs' election data\nspans the twenty years preceding the filing of the plaintiffs' complaint\nin October of 1992. During those twenty years, there were ten county\n\n                     42\n\fcommissioner elections, and of those ten elections the plaintiffs have\noffered election data from five general elections and six primary elec-\ntions. In other words, the plaintiffs have offered election data from a\nmajority of the county commissioner elections held within the two\ndecades preceding the filing of their complaint. I believe it is clear\nthat the proffer of such extensive election data as this satisfies the\nplaintiffs' burden to produce sufficient election data from which a fair\nassessment can be made. See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 61 (conclud-\ning that \"the District Court's approach, which tested data derived\nfrom three election years in each district, and which revealed that\nblacks strongly supported black candidates, while, to the black candi-\ndates' usual detriment, whites rarely did, satisfactorily addresses each\nfacet of the legal standard\"); Uno v.

And, as I have said, black/white elections are generally more\nprobative than white/white elections. It therefore follows that if the\nplaintiffs have proffered election data sufficient to provide a \"fair\nassessment\" of the third Gingles precondition, and that election data\nonly involves black/white elections, the defendant is free to counter\nwith evidence of election data from elections in which no minority\nwas a candidate. As the Third Circuit has said:\n\n          We . . . do not believe that plaintiffs are required to pres-\n          ent evidence on white versus white elections if they do not\n          believe that those elections are probative. If the defendants\n          want to introduce evidence on those elections in an attempt\n          to rebut the plaintiffs' evidence of cohesiveness or white\n          bloc voting, they may do so. Nevertheless, because white\n          versus white elections tend to be less probative, there may\n          still be cases in which \"[t]he evidence of polarized voting\n          . . . is so strong . . . that it cannot be overcome even when\n\n                    43\n\f          all reasonable inferences are accorded to the evidence of\n          elections involving only white candidates.\"\n\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1128-29 (quoting Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1317); see\nUno, 72 F.2d at 988 & n.8 (noting that when district court only exam-\nined elections involving minority candidates, \"evidence exhumed\nfrom `white only' elections may still be relevant in assessing the total-\nity of the circumstances in a vote dilution case, especially if it tends\nto rebut the evidence of cohesion or white bloc voting extracted from\n`mixed' elections\") (emphasis added; citation omitted).\n\nIn this case, the County offered no evidence from white/white elec-\ntions. And, in fact, the County has not even argued that such elections\nare probative. Accordingly, the majority is simply wrong to uphold\nthe district court's decision granting summary judgment because the\nplaintiffs have not offered evidence from elections in which no minor-\nity was a candidate.\n\nII.\n\nThe majority is also wrong to conclude that if we only consider the\nelection data that the plaintiffs have proffered from black/white elec-\ntions, the plaintiffs have still failed to establish a violation of section\n2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973. Ante at 8. In particular,\nI believe that the majority's (and the district court's) methodology for\ndetermining who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate is\nfundamentally flawed and that the County is not entitled to summary\njudgment when the election data put forth by the plaintiffs is properly\nconsidered.\n\nInitially, I emphasize that the majority opinion does not squarely\naddress the issue of the procedural posture of this case. We are hear-\ning this case on appeal from the district court's grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the County, and not after a trial on the merits.\nTherefore, it is the moving party (i.e., the County) that has the burden\nof showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring a\ntrial, and we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-\nmoving party (i.e., the plaintiffs). In addition, while the plaintiffs here\nbear the ultimate burden of persuasion on their vote dilution claim,\nthe County must show that there is an absence of evidence to support\n\n                     44\n\fthe plaintiffs' claim in order to succeed on summary judgment. See,\ne.g., Marylanders for Fair Representation, Inc. v. Schaefer, 849 F.\nSupp. 1022, 1030 (D. Md. 1994) (three-judge court) (citing Celotex\nCorp. v.

The district court assessed a paper record, and we\nshould, as we normally do on summary judgment, review the court's\nfindings de novo. Cf. ante at 22-23, 27-28 (upholding district court's\nfactual findings under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).5\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 As I have noted, the County has not even argued that the plaintiffs\nmust submit election data from white/white elections, nor has the County\nsubmitted any such data. In short, the County has not shown that the\nabsence of data on white/white elections means that there is insufficient\nevidence to support the plaintiffs' vote dilution claim. Therefore, under\nbasic summary judgment principles, I am at a loss as to how the majority\ncan conclude that the County is entitled to summary judgment because\nthe plaintiffs have not proffered election data from white/white elections.\n5 The Court in Gingles did not discuss what level of deference an\nappellate court is to accord a district court's factual findings on summary\njudgment. The Court did, however, stress that because of the fact inten-\nsive nature of a vote dilution claim, a district court's factual findings\nmade after trial are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule\n52(a). As the Court said:\n\n          We reaffirm our view that the clearly-erroneous test of Rule\n          52(a) is the appropriate standard of appellate review of a finding\n          of vote dilution. As both amended ยง 2 and its legislative history\n          make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution\n          through districting, the trial court is to consider the \"totality of\n          the circumstances\" and to determine, based \"upon a searching\n          practical evaluation of `the past and present reality,'\" [S. Rep.\n\n                    45\n\fOf course, the legal standards that the district court applied are not\nentitled to any deference. And even if there had been a trial on the\nmerits in this case, we would still have the \"power to correct errors\nof law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of\nlaw and fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunder-\nstanding of the governing rule of law.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (inter-\nnal quotes and citations omitted). Accordingly, I turn now to the\nerrors of law that infected the district court's decision in this case--\nerrors that the majority has simply compounded.\n\nA.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenge the methodology employed by the district\ncourt on several grounds. First, the plaintiffs argue that the district\ncourt erred \"[b]y grouping together white candidates for whom black\nvoters voted only in the absence of other alternatives with candidates\nwho were enthusiastically and overwhelmingly supported by black\nvoters (and who were, with one exception, black) . .. .\" Appellants'\nBrief at 16. According to the plaintiffs, the fact that many white Dem-\nocratic candidates received substantial electoral support from black\nvoters in general elections does not show that these candidates are\nminority preferred. Rather, it is a reflection of the fact that when the\nonly electoral choice is to vote for a white Republican or a white\nDemocrat, blacks in Alamance County usually choose the white Dem-\n_________________________________________________________________\n           No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in 1982\n           U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208 (footnote omitted)], whether the political\n           process is equally open to minority voters. \"`This determination\n           is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case,'\" Rodgers [v.\n           Lodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621 (1982)], quoting Nevett v.

In the absence of a trial, it is\ndifficult to imagine how the district court can make\"a searching practical\nevaluation of `the past and present reality'\" to determine who is and who\nis not a minority-preferred candidate. Without such an evaluation, there\nis no reason or basis for deferring to the district court's factual findings\nunder the clearly erroneous standard.\n\n                     46\n\focrat. Therefore, the district court should have conducted an individu-\nalized assessment of each candidate that received a majority of the\nminority's support in the general election to determine if that candi-\ndate was truly minority preferred. For example, the district court\nshould have examined primary election results (nominating elections\nwhere the effects of partisan voting are minimized) to determine the\nblack community's true level of support for a particular candidate.\n\nSecond, while the district court failed to examine primary elections\nto help determine who is and who is not minority preferred, the plain-\ntiffs argue that the district court erred because it equated success in\nprimary elections with success in general elections. This, according\nto the plaintiffs, is wrong because \"winning the primary does not\nplace the winner in office.\" Id. at 25.\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs believe that the district court erred because it\nfailed to discount the three election victories of Jack O'Kelley, the\nonly black candidate ever elected to Alamance County's Board of\nCommissioners. Id. at 26. In particular, the plaintiffs contend that the\ndistrict court should not have counted O'Kelley's election victories\nbecause O'Kelley first gained office by appointment, not election. In\nother words, unlike every other county commissioner, O'Kelley has\nalways been an incumbent. Thus, the factual circumstances surround-\ning his election victories are not typical, and they provide little guid-\nance for determining whether white bloc voting usually defeats the\nminority's preferred candidate.\n\nThe majority disagrees with much of what the plaintiffs argue,\nthough to its credit the majority does correctly recognize that \"pri-\nmary and general elections results should not be aggregated for pur-\nposes of determining whether black-preferred candidates are `usually'\nsuccessful . . . .\" Ante at 27. Thus, the majority evidently agrees with\nthe plaintiffs that even though a minority-preferred candidate wins in\nthe primary, this success alone does not count for purposes of deter-\nmining whether the minority is usually able to elect its preferred can-\ndidates to office. And I too agree on this point.\n\nNevertheless, I cannot agree with the majority's conclusions with\nrespect to the plaintiffs' other assigned errors. According to the\nmajority, the district court actually \"erred in plaintiffs' favor by not\n\n                     47\n\ftreating as `black-preferred' some . . . candidates who placed second\nor third among black voters (and with a significant majority of black\nvotes) behind an unsuccessful candidate who was the first choice of\nblack voters.\" Ante at 17-18. Also, the majority believes that the dis-\ntrict court did not err when it failed to conduct an individualized\ndetermination of candidates who placed second or third among minor-\nity voters when the minority's first choice was successful. Ante at 22-\n23. Furthermore, the majority rejects the plaintiffs' argument that pri-\nmary election results provide a basis to help determine whether a can-\ndidate is minority preferred in the general election. See ante at 23-26.\nAnd the majority believes that the district court did not err in giving\nfull weight to the three election victories of Jack O'Kelley. Ante at 27.\n\nI believe that in reaching these conclusions the majority has seri-\nously misread the Supreme Court's decision in Gingles, our own pre-\ncedent, and precedent from our sister circuits. As I explain below, the\ncritical error that both the majority and the district court make is to\nisolate election data from the actual circumstances surrounding an\nelection and then to treat such data as dispositive for purposes of\ndetermining who is a minority-preferred candidate (though, under\nmost circumstances, the majority does not treat the data as dispositive\nfor purposes of determining who is not a minority-preferred candidate).6\nGranted, election data (taken in isolation) provides some guidance in\nmaking a determination of who is and who is not a minority-preferred\ncandidate. However, both section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and\nGingles demand a more searching inquiry than mere reference to the\npercentage of minority voter support that a candidate has received,\nparticularly when the candidate is not a minority and an at-large vot-\ning system is employed. At the very least, we must examine the par-\nticular circumstances of each case to discern whether the electoral\nsupport that minority voters give a candidate (especially in general\nelections) truly reflects minority voters' preference or whether such\nsupport is itself a manifestation of a structural inequality in the chal-\nlenged voting system.\n_________________________________________________________________\n6 When questioned at his deposition, the plaintiffs' expert fell into\nsomewhat the same trap as the majority and the district court, acknowl-\nedging minority-preferred candidates based on election data taken in iso-\nlation.\n\n                    48\n\f1.\n\nWe have covered much of this ground before.

As we explained in Collins II:\n\n           The mere election of a candidate who appears to have\n           received votes from more than fifty percent of minority bal-\n           lots does not count as a minority electoral success, when\n           each ballot may contain votes for more than one candidate.\n           In such a situation, if there were other candidates, preferred\n           by a significantly higher percentage of the minority commu-\n           nity, who were defeated in the same election, then it cannot\n_________________________________________________________________\n7 In Collins II the minority plaintiffs challenged the at-large voting sys-\ntem used to elect the City Council in Norfolk, Virginia. We explained\nthat \"`[t]he essence of a ยง 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice,\nor structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an\ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect\ntheir preferred candidates.'\" Id. at 1236 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n47). We then stated that \"[t]he proper identification of minority voters'\n`representatives of their choice' is critical.\" Id. at 1237. And, we recog-\nnized that the plaintiffs' primary complaint was not that minority voters\nwere unable to elect their first choice to the city council, but rather that\nthe at-large voting system prevented minority voters from electing a sec-\nond preferred candidate as well. Id. at 1240 (\"In the context of this case\nit is necessary to apply Gingles' teaching to the black community's\nattempt to elect a second black councilman.\"). For this reason alone, the\nmajority is wrong to say that Collins II left open the question of how to\ntreat second- and third-place finishers when the minority's first choice is\nsuccessful. See ante at 22. Because minority voters in Norfolk were able\nto elect one candidate, Collins II clearly addresses the situation where\nthere is a successful minority-preferred candidate.\n\n                     49\n\f          fairly be said that the minority community has successfully\n          elected representatives of its choice. Each situation must be\n          reviewed individually to determine whether the elected can-\n          didates can be fairly considered as representatives of the\n          minority community. The presumption must be that they\n          cannot, if some other candidate has received significantly\n          more minority votes.\n\n883 F.2d at 1238 (emphasis added; quoting Collins IV, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487143\"><a href=\"/opinion/487143/herbert-m-collins-dr-h-marks-s-richard-barbara-c-parham-william-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n937 (4th Cir. 1987)).\n\nCollins II thus demands a two-step inquiry. In the first step we\ndecide whether there is a presumption that a candidate is or is not\nminority preferred. When an unsuccessful candidate receives a signif-\nicantly higher percentage of the minority vote than candidates who\nwin election with a majority of the minority vote, the elected candi-\ndates are presumed not to be minority preferred. When, however, an\nunsuccessful candidate receives a percentage of the minority vote\nwhich is not significantly higher than that of the elected second- and\nthird-place finishers, we presume that the second- and third-place fin-\nishers are minority preferred. Either way, however, the election data\nonly creates a presumption.\n\nIn the second step of the inquiry the district court must determine\nwhether the presumption is supported by other facts. The court must\nmake an individualized determination of \"whether the elected candi-\ndates can be fairly considered as representatives of the minority com-\nmunity.\" Depending on the outcome of the first step, there may be a\npresumption for or against finding that a candidate is minority pre-\nferred, but regardless of the presumption the district court must make\nan individualized determination in \"[e]ach situation.\" Such an individ-\nualized determination is required, because as both Congress and the\nSupreme Court recognize, \"whether the political processes are equally\nopen depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and\npresent reality, and on a functional view of the political process.\" S.\nRep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in 1982\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 & 79.\n\nThe majority recognizes that Collins II demands a two-step inquiry.\nSee ante at 19. The majority, however, misconstrues the inquiry.\n\n                    50\n\fUnder the first step, according to the majority, a second- or third-\nplace finisher is minority preferred if the unsuccessful first choice\nreceived a percentage of the minority vote which is not significantly\nhigher than that of the elected second- and third-place finishers. Id.\nIn this situation, the majority believes that a district court need not\n(and evidently cannot) proceed to the second step of the inquiry in\norder to make the individualized determination required under the Act\nand Gingles. Id. at 20 (\"Because[unsuccessful candidate] Morris'\nsupport among black voters was not `significantly higher' than [suc-\ncessful candidate] Long's, the district court appears to have erred in\nnot automatically treating Long as a black-preferred candidate.\")\n(emphasis added).\n\nNeedless to say, cutting off the inquiry at the first step makes a\ncourt's \"searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality\"\ndependent exclusively upon election results taken in isolation. Yet,\nbecause at-large voting systems often fail to provide an accurate view\nof the political process (among other things, they may create the\nappearance of minority preference), I believe that a court must pro-\nceed to the second step of the inquiry even when\"the unsuccessful\nfirst choice among minority voters did not receive a`significant\nhigher percentage' of the minority community's support.\"\n\nOf course, when the level of support received by the unsuccessful\nfirst-place finisher among minority voters is \"significantly higher\"\nthan the support given the second- and third-place finishers by those\nsame voters, the majority agrees that only a presumption is created\nagainst finding that the second- and third-place finishers are minority\npreferred. Id. at 21 (asserting that \"we held in Collins II (sic) only that\nsuccessful candidates who receive more than 50% of the black vote\nshould not automatically be viewed as a black-preferred candidate if\nthey receive significantly less support from black voters than another,\nlosing candidate, not that they should never be treated as black-\npreferred\") (emphasis in original). I fail, however, to discern any rea-\nson for creating the presumption (and proceeding to the second step)\nonly when an unsuccessful first-place finisher receives a significantly\nhigher percentage of the minority vote, and neither the Act, nor\nGingles, nor Collins II supports the majority's conclusion to the con-\ntrary.\n\n                     51\n\fFor much the same reason, the majority is also wrong to conclude\nthat \"any candidate who receives a majority of the minority vote and\nwho finishes behind a successful candidate who was the first choice\namong the minority voters is automatically to be deemed a black-\npreferred candidate . . . .\" Ante at 22 (emphasis in original). Indeed,\nunder the majority's theory even when a successful minority-preferred\ncandidate garners significantly higher minority support than success-\nful second- and third-place finishers (who receive over 50 percent of\nthe minority vote), a district court must automatically treat the suc-\ncessful second-and third-place finishers as minority-preferred candi-\ndates. And, in fact, the majority goes so far as to conclude that even\nthough a candidate fails to gain a majority of the minority vote, there\nis a presumption that the candidate is minority preferred provided that\nthe candidate would have won a seat in an at-large election among\nblack voters. Id. at 22 (stating that \"[c]andidates who receive less than\n50% of the minority vote, but who would have been elected had the\nelection been held only among black voters, are presumed also to be\nminority-preferred candidates, although an individualized assessment\nshould be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may appro-\npriately be so considered\"). That has never been the law, nor should\nit be.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n8 The flaw in the majority's approach is illustrated by the following\nhypothetical. An at-large election for four slots is held. There are eight\ncandidates. Candidate number 1 wins with 99 percent of the minority\nvote; candidate number 2 loses with 95 percent of the minority vote; can-\ndidate number 3 wins with 51 percent of the minority vote; candidate\nnumber 4 wins with 20 percent of the minority vote; candidate number\n5 loses with 15 percent of the minority vote; candidate number 6 loses\nwith 10 percent of the minority vote; candidate number 7 loses with 5\npercent of the minority vote; and candidate number 8 wins with 3 percent\nof the minority vote. According to the majority, we must automatically\ntreat candidate number 3 as minority preferred even though that candi-\ndate received far less support than candidate number 1 or candidate num-\nber 2. Also, according to the majority, there is a presumption that\ncandidate number 4 is minority preferred even though that candidate\nreceived the support of only one in five minority voters. That cannot be\nright. It also directly conflicts with our holding in Collins II, because as\nI have previously noted, see supra at 49 n.7, in Collins II (as in the above\nhypothetical), the minority was successful in electing its first candidate\nof choice. See 883 F.2d at 1240.\n\n                  52\n\fThe only way that the majority can reach these conclusions is to\ndisregard our clear language in Collins II and other precedent\nthroughout the circuits. These are decisions that hold that a successful\ncandidate is not automatically minority preferred merely because that\ncandidate receives more than 50% of the minority vote. And these are\ndecisions that either hold or assume that a candidate who receives less\nthan 50% of the minority vote cannot (by definition) be minority pre-\nferred. As we stated in Collins II:\n\n          The district court's error in finding successful candidates\n          who received over 50% of the minority vote to be the cho-\n          sen representatives of the minority community, despite the\n          fact that other candidates received a much greater percent-\n          age of the minority vote, is not simply technical or semantic.\n          ...\n\n          A moment's reflection shows how the district court's\n          method of identifying the black community's representa-\n          tives of choice defeats a primary purpose of the Act. In\n          1974, 21 candidates sought the 4 open seats on the council.\n          In 1980, 12 candidates vied for 3 open seats. In 1974, each\n          voter--black and white--could cast four votes and in 1980\n          three votes. If black voters exercised their right to cast all\n          of their allotted votes, they ran the risk that their second and\n          third choices would be declared their preferred candidates.\n          Only by single-shot voting--withholding all votes save for\n          their first choice, and forfeiting the opportunity to cast all\n          votes allotted to each voter--could the minority be assured\n          that its second and third choices would not be declared its\n          preferred candidates. In contrast, under the at-large system,\n          the white voters can freely cast all votes allotted to them\n          without suffering the penalty imposed on the minority vot-\n          ers. The district court's construction of the Act defeats the\n          congressional purpose of assuring that the opportunity to\n          participate in the electoral process is open to all citizens.\n\n          We are aware of no case that supports the district court's\n          construction of the Act.\n\n883 F.2d at 1239-40 (emphasis added); see NAACP v.

See also Uno, 72 F.3d at 989 (\"[D]etermining\nwhether racial bloc voting exists is not merely an arithmetic exercise\nthat consists of toting up columns of numbers, and nothing more. To\nthe contrary, the district court should not confine itself to raw num-\nbers, but must make a practical, commonsense assay of all the evi-\ndence.\") (citations omitted).\n\nThe effect of the majority's unprecedented decision will be to\nundermine the Voting Rights Act. After today, structural inequalities\nthat may be at work in at-large voting systems will be masked by the\nstructure itself, perpetuating those very inequalities that the Act is\nintended to remedy. The reason for this is simple. As I have\nexplained, at-large voting systems may work to create the appearance\nof minority preference where none actually exists. Thus, to allow\nelection results alone to dictate whether a candidate is minority pre-\nferred is to validate the structural inequalities which may be present\nin at-large voting systems based on the system itself. That is circular\nreasoning, I believe.\n\nWe are bound to follow Collins II. In sum, therefore, we should\nhold that a district court must always make an individualized determi-\nnation of whether any second- or third-place finisher who receives a\nmajority of the minority vote is actually minority preferred. When a\nminority-preferred candidate (whether successful or not) receives a\nsignificantly higher percentage of the minority vote, we must presume\nthat the second- or third-place finisher who receives a majority of the\nminority vote is not minority preferred. When a minority-preferred\ncandidate (whether successful or not) does not receive a significantly\nhigher percentage of the minority vote, we must presume that the sec-\n\n                    54\n\fond-or third-place finisher is minority preferred, provided that the\nsecond- or third-place finisher received a majority of the minority\nvote. And when any candidate receives less than a majority of the\nminority vote, that candidate can never be deemed minority preferred.\n\n2.\n\nI also believe that it is clear that when making an individualized\ndetermination of who is and who is not a minority-preferred candi-\ndate, a district court must examine the particular facts and circum-\nstances surrounding each election and candidate in order to ascertain\nwhich, if any, candidate or candidates the minority community has\nsponsored. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n.25. In other words, the dis-\ntrict court must look at the totality of the circumstances in each situa-\ntion.\n\nThere is nothing unique about this approach, and depending on the\nfacts, it may help or hurt plaintiffs' ability to prevail in a vote dilution\ncase. See, e.g., Uno, 72 F.3d at 989 (criticizing district court for fail-\ning to take into account city's \"rapidly changing political environ-\nment\" which may have allowed the minority group to sponsor\nsuccessful candidates); Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129 (\"In deciding which,\nif any, of the white candidates were minority preferred, the court must\nengage in a detailed, practical evaluation of the extent to which any\nparticular white candidate was, as a realistic matter, the minority vot-\ners' representative of choice.\"); Collins II , 883 F.2d at 1238 (\"in addi-\ntion to the bare statistics, it is appropriate to consider testimony\nrevealing how political observers and the candidates themselves\nviewed the city's claim that [the candidates] were the minority's pre-\nferred candidates and representatives of choice\"); Smith, 687 F. Supp.\nat 1316-17 (emphasizing that \"considerable weight\" should be given\nto elections between black and white candidates, but still examining\nmultiple factors to determine minority voters' representatives of\nchoice).\n\nBecause we should examine the totality of the circumstances, a dis-\ntrict court should not hesitate to look at any evidence that might be\nprobative. Accordingly, I can not agree with the majority that primary\nelection results do not bear on the question of who is and who is not\na minority-preferred candidate. See ante at 23-26. Cf. Niagara Falls,\n\n                     55\n\f65 F.3d at 1019 (\"When a candidate receives support from 50% or\nmore of minority voters in a general election, a court need not treat\nthe candidate as minority-preferred when another candidate receiving\ngreater support in the primary failed to reach the general election.\");\nSanchez, 875 F.2d at 1496 (examining totality of the circumstances,\nincluding \"testimony to the effect that no candidate could secure the\nDemocratic slot in county races without the support of a group of His-\npanics that included some of the plaintiffs\"). Moreover, I believe that\nwhile the race of the candidate is not dispositive, it too is a fact which\nin the totality of the circumstances the court may consider. See\nJenkins, 4 F.3d at 1129. Again, \"whether the political processes are\nequally open depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the\npast and present reality, and on a functional view of the political pro-\ncess.\" S. Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982), reprinted in\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 & 79. A district\ncourt should not therefore refrain from examining election data from\nprimaries in order to help determine who is and who is not a minority-\npreferred candidate. Nor should the district court ignore the fact that\nminority voters often support minority candidates.\n\nWhen, for example, a white candidate fails to gain a majority of the\nminority vote in the primary election (yet still wins nomination), the\nfact that such a candidate subsequently gains a majority of the minor-\nity vote in the general election is of minimal probative value. This is\nespecially true when minority voters strongly support a losing minor-\nity candidate in the primary election process.9 Simply put, while the\nmajority may be correct to say that minority voters do not \"take their\nmarbles and go home whenever the candidate whom they prefer most\nin the primary does not prevail,\" ante at 24, the requirements of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n9 Obviously, while we should treat the defeat of a minority-preferred\ncandidate in a primary as a defeat for purposes of determining whether\nGingles' third precondition has been met, we should not treat the success\nof a minority-preferred candidate in receiving his or her party's nomina-\ntion as a success for purposes of the same inquiry. Only if a minority-\npreferred candidate is actually elected has the minority succeeded in the\nelectoral process. Winning the primary is all to the good, but without\nwinning the general election, white majority bloc voting may have still\nsucceeded in defeating the minority-preferred candidate or candidates.\n\n                     56\n\fVoting Rights Act are not met if \"[c]andidates favored by blacks can\nwin, but only if the candidates are white.\" Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1318.10\n\n3.\n\nAs a district court must examine the totality of the circumstances\nto determine who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, a\ndistrict court must also examine whether \"special circumstances\" have\nresulted in a minority-preferred candidate winning a particular elec-\ntion or elections. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51 & 57. In such a case, a claim\nof vote dilution may still succeed because a pattern of racial bloc vot-\ning may still result in the defeat of minority-preferred candidates\nunder normal election conditions. See id. at 57 (\"the success of a\nminority candidate in a particular election does not necessarily prove\nthat the district did not experience polarized voting in that election;\nspecial circumstances, such as the absence of an opponent, incum-\n_________________________________________________________________\n10 In Jenkins the Third Circuit outlined the following non-exhaustive\nlist of factors that a court should examine when deciding whether a white\ncandidate may properly be considered minority preferred:\n\n          One relevant consideration is the extent to which the minority\n          community can be said to have sponsored the candidate. In\n          determining whether the minority community sponsored the can-\n          didate, the court should look to the level of minority involvement\n          in initially advancing the particular candidate and in conducting\n          or financing that candidate's campaign.\n\n          Additionally, the attention which the candidate gave to the\n          particular needs and interests of the minority community, includ-\n          ing the extent to which the candidate campaigned in predomi-\n          nately minority areas or addressed predominately minority\n          crowds and interests, may be relevant factors.\n\n          Another relevant consideration would be the rates at which\n          black voters turned out when a minority candidate sought office\n          as compared to elections involving only white candidates.\n          Finally, bearing in mind the disincentives that may exist for\n          minority candidates to seek office, the extent to which minority\n          candidates have run for office and the ease or difficulty with\n          which a minority candidate can qualify to run for office may be\n          relevant considerations.\n\n4 F.3d at 1129 (citations omitted).\n\n                    57\n\fbency, or the utilization of bullet voting, may explain minority elec-\ntoral success in a polarized contest\") (footnote omitted).\n\nHere, for example, I believe that the district court erred when it\ncounted as minority electoral success all three election victories of\nblack candidate Jack O'Kelley. At the very least the district court\nshould have discounted O'Kelley's first election victory in 1974. That\nelection and the candidacy of O'Kelley were atypical for two reasons.\nFirst, O'Kelley was initially appointed (not elected) to fill a vacant\nslot on the Board of Commissioners. He thus ran as an incumbent\neven though he had never been elected. Second, and more impor-\ntantly, the 1974 general election was both a special election for the\nseat to which O'Kelley had previously been appointed, and it was an\nat-large election for two other seats on the Commission. And, of\ncourse, O'Kelley ran in the special election, not the at-large election.\nThus, I would hold that as a matter of law O'Kelley's incumbency,\ncoupled with his appointment and the unique nature of his 1974 elec-\ntion, constitute special circumstances requiring that we discount this\nelection victory.\n\nAs for O'Kelley's second and third elections in 1976 and 1980, it\nmay or may not be appropriate to count these elections as instances\nwhere the minority was successful in electing its preferred candidate.\nBecause of the odd nature of the 1974 election, O'Kelley was forced\nto run for reelection after only two years (not the normal four years).\nAccordingly, there is evidence that \"special circumstances\" exist that\nalso might require us to discount O'Kelley's 1976 election. As for the\n1980 election, the effects of O'Kelley's initial appointment, coupled\nwith his incumbency, may still persist. And, as the Court in Gingles\nexpressly recognizes, incumbency may constitute a special circum-\nstance in certain situations. 478 U.S. at 57. Accordingly, because we\nhear this case on an appeal from summary judgment, I would hold\nthat there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether O'Kelley's\nsecond and third election victories should be counted for purposes of\nGingles' third precondition. These fact issues should be resolved at\ntrial, after the district court has examined the totality of the circum-\nstances surrounding O'Kelley's second and third election victories.\n\nB.\n\nIn light of the proper methodology described above, I turn now to\nexamine the election data that the plaintiffs have proffered. Of course,\n\n                     58\n\fbecause there has been no trial, and thus no \"individual determina-\ntions\" of who is and who is not a minority-preferred candidate, the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment should be reversed for this\nreason alone. In addition, even if we merely examine the election\ndata, I believe it clear that the presumptions we recognized as appro-\npriate in Collins II indicate that minority-preferred candidates have\nrarely been successful. I would therefore hold that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether minority-preferred candidates are\nusually defeated by white bloc voting and that the case should be\nremanded for trial.\n\nThe 1972 Election:\n\nIn 1972 Morris (a black candidate) received 98% of the black vote\nin the Democratic primary but was defeated nonetheless. Long (a\nwhite candidate) received 84% of the black vote and was nominated.\nNo other candidate received a majority of the minority vote. Thus,\nassuming that 98% of the vote is not \"significantly higher\" than 84%\nof the vote, there is a presumption that we have two minority-\npreferred candidates--one of whom we know lost (Morris). Because\nneither party has proffered election data from the 1972 general elec-\ntion, it would appear that we cannot determine whether Long was suc-\ncessful or not in the general election. However, candidate Long also\nran in the 1974 election. It is thus apparent that Long was not elected\nin 1972. Accordingly, we may presume that minority voters were not\nable to elect either of their preferred candidates in 1972.\n\nThe 1974 Election:\n\nThe parties have failed to provide the primary results from the\n1974 Democratic primary, but Newlin (a white candidate) won the\ngeneral election with 99% of the black vote, and Long lost with 99%\nof the black vote. I will therefore count Newlin as a successful\nminority-preferred candidate and Long as an unsuccessful minority\ncandidate (though again the record is incomplete on this point). Also,\nas I have said, O'Kelley's election is not counted because he had\nrecently been appointed to the Board of Commissioners, and he was\nrunning to fill a single vacant seat. Thus, as of 1974 there is a pre-\nsumption that there had been four minority-preferred candidates, one\ncandidate who was elected and three candidates who were not.\n\n                     59\n\fThe 1976 Election:\n\nIn 1976 only O'Kelley received the support of a majority of black\nvoters in the Democratic primary election. Therefore, he is the only\ncandidate that should be presumed minority preferred. But again,\nbecause O'Kelley did not serve a full term after his 1974 election, it\nmay be inappropriate to count his success in the general election.\nThus, as of 1976 there still had been only four minority-preferred can-\ndidates, only one of whom was elected.\n\nThe 1978 Election:\n\nIn the 1978 Democratic primary, Harris (a black candidate)\nreceived 78% of the black vote but was not nominated, and Newlin\n(a white candidate) received 60% of the black vote and was nomi-\nnated. The majority does not disagree that Harris's support among\nminority voters was significantly higher than Newlin's support. See\nante at 20-21. In addition, the district court reached the same conclu-\nsion. We should therefore presume that there was only one minority-\npreferred candidate in 1978 (Harris). Because he was unsuccessful, as\nof 1978 there had been five minority-preferred candidates, one candi-\ndate who was elected and four candidates who were not.\n\nThe 1980 Election:\n\nIn the 1980 Democratic primary, O'Kelley received 99% of the\nblack vote and was nominated, and Fleming (a white candidate)\nreceived 57% of the black vote but was not nominated. No other can-\ndidate received a majority of the minority vote in the primary. Thus,\nfor purposes of summary judgment I would not count either O'Kelley\nor Fleming as minority preferred. The effects of O'Kelley's initial\nappointment (coupled with his incumbency) may still persist, though\nless so than in 1974 and 1976. And Fleming did not receive \"signifi-\ncantly\" close to the same amount of support as O'Kelley. Accord-\ningly, as of 1980, there remained five minority-preferred candidates,\none candidate who was elected and four candidates who were not.\n\nThe 1984 Election:\n\nIn the 1984 Democratic primary, Freeman (a black candidate)\nreceived 98% of the black vote and was nominated. Paris (a white\n\n                     60\n\fcandidate) received 50% of the black vote but was not nominated.\nBecause Freeman's minority support was significantly higher than\nParis's, I would presume that Paris was not a minority-preferred can-\ndidate. In the general election, Freeman lost. Therefore, as of 1984\nthere had been six minority-preferred candidates, one who was\nelected and five who were not.\n\nThe 1986 Election:\n\nThe parties have not provided primary results for 1986. In the gen-\neral election, however, Bennett (a white candidate) won with 99% of\nthe black vote. I will therefore count him as a successful minority-\npreferred candidate. However, Morris (a black candidate) lost the\ngeneral election, though he got 57% of the black vote. Although Mor-\nris is a minority and received a majority of the minority vote, I will\nnonetheless presume that he is not a minority-preferred candidate\nbecause Bennett received significantly higher support. Therefore, as\nof 1986 we should presume that there had been seven minority-\npreferred candidates, two who were elected and five who were not.\n\nThe 1992 Election:\n\nIn the 1992 Democratic primary, Torain (a black candidate)\nreceived 74% of the black vote in the primary but was not nominated.\nNo one other candidate received a majority of the black vote. I thus\npresume that Torain was the only minority-preferred candidate in\n1992.\n\nIn total, therefore, we should presume that there have been eight\nminority-preferred candidates, two who were elected and six who\nwere not. Accordingly, based only upon the election data proffered,\nI believe that the County is not entitled to summary judgment. See\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 75 (\"the language ofยง2 and its legislative history\nplainly demonstrate that proof that some minority candidates have\nbeen elected does not foreclose a ยง2 claim\"). And, I reemphasize, this\nanalysis only shows which candidate (whether black or white) the\ncourt should presume to be minority preferred. An individual determi-\nnation as to each candidate should be made after trial to ensure that\nall minority-preferred candidates have been properly identified.\n\n                     61\n\f****\n\nIt is no doubt true that we may not (and should not) simply assume\nthat \"`voters of a particular race, because of their race, \"think alike,\nshare the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates\nat the polls\".'\" Ante at 29 (quoting Miller v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Still, a particular\nvoting system may work to prevent black voters from having the\nsame opportunity to elect their chosen representatives as white voters,\nand such a system violates the law. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 652 (recog-\nnizing that a vote dilution claim is \"analytically distinct\" from a claim\nthat the state has used race as a basis for separating voters into dis-\ntricts). Accord Miller, 115 S. Ct. at 2485-86.11\n\nHere, the plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence to defeat the\nCounty's motion for summary judgment because that evidence shows\n_________________________________________________________________\n11 Evidently, however, under the views expressed in the concurring\nopinion such a system would not violate the law. Of course, to reach that\nconclusion we would have to read the Voting Rights Act out of exis-\ntence, something I do not believe that the Supreme Court has done in\nBush v. Vera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118040\"><a href=\"/opinion/118040/bush-v-vera/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Likewise, there is nothing uncon-\nstitutional about requiring the trial court \"to consider the totality of the\ncircumstances and to determine, based upon a searching practical evalua-\ntion of the past and present reality, whether the political process is\nequally open to minority voters.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (citation and\ninternal quotes omitted). While we, as the appellate court, might there-\nfore be faced with hard questions on review (though I doubt that they are\n\"impenetrable\" ones), we must nonetheless decide whether the trial court\nhas correctly followed the law -- even when it is a law that we might\nthink unwise or unnecessary in today's world. And I must respectfully\ndiffer with my concurring colleague if he regards that as an \"intensely\nrace-conscious approach.\" See ante at 32.\n\n                     62\n\fthat a genuine question of fact exists as to whether the at-large\nmethod for electing commissioners in Alamance County deprives\nblack voters of the same opportunity to elect representatives of choice\nas is enjoyed by white voters. The County may ultimately prevail on\nthat question, but without a trial neither we, nor the County, nor the\ncitizens of Alamance will know. Again, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                    63\n\f</pre>",
