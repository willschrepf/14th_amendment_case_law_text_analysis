Only two days after assisting another prisoner in filing a grievance,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant William Evans was placed in administrative segregation for nine days due to a\n\nfalse-positive drug test. Evans then filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit against seven prison\n\nofficials—Defendants-Appellees Harry Christopher Vinson, Nancy Doom, Glenn Haeberlin, Byron\n\nJasis, Joe Keene, Rick Pershing, and Junior Ross—alleging violations of Evans’s First, Fourth,\n\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court granted Defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment; Evans appeals. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE\n\nin part, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       The original seven plaintiffs in this case, Alando Sublett, James DeBow, William Evans,\n\nDaniel Lindsey, Donnie Ashby, Aaron Burnett, and James Dunn, were all incarcerated at the\n\nKentucky State Penitentiary (“KSP”) in May 2005. Evans is the only plaintiff remaining in the suit.\n\nThe relevant facts, taken in the light most favorable to Evans, are as follows:\n\n       On May 17, 2005, Sublett was given a “stick test”—a urine test used in the field to screen\n\nfor illegal drug use—by Defendant Vinson, a correctional officer at KSP, and another officer.\n\nVinson, displeased with the results, allegedly destroyed Sublett’s first sample and ordered another\n\nwith a different witness. Sublett was then sent to his cell without an opportunity to witness the\n\nsealing of the sample or its chain of custody, which is inconsistent with the process usually followed\n\nfor administering drug tests at KSP. Half an hour later, Sublett was placed in administrative\n\nsegregation in “3 Cellhouse” as a result of the stick test, which Defendants claimed was positive.\n\nDefendants sent an additional sample to Aegis Sciences Corporation (“Aegis”) for confirmation.\n\n       On May 18, 2005, DeBow, an inmate grievance aide, received a message about the incident\n\nand approached Evans, an inmate legal aide, about assisting Sublett in getting released. Evans sent\n\na memorandum to Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin requesting Sublett’s release on due\n\nprocess grounds.\n\n       On May 19, 2005, Defendants received the lab report from Aegis showing that Sublett had\n\ntested negative for drug use, and Sublett was released from segregation. That same day, Vinson\n\nadministered stick tests to DeBow and Evans, and Defendant Keene, the deputy warden for security\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nat KSP, served as a witness. Following the tests, DeBow and Evans were ordered to return to their\n\ncells. Approximately forty-five minutes later, they were placed in the “‘Super Max’ Administrative\n\nSegregation Unit (7 Cellhouse)” based on allegedly positive stick tests. The May 19, 2005 detention\n\norder stated that Evans was “being placed in 7 Cellhouse Admin. Seg. for investigation into Illegal\n\nDrug Activity within the institution. This action was taken for the Safety of Staff and inmates, and\n\nthe safe and secure operation of this institution.” (Detention Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71 Ex. 2.)\n\nWhile in 7 Cellhouse, Evans was subjected to a nude strip search, haircut, and shave, and restricted\n\nfrom his job as a legal aide and all of the privileges he enjoyed in the general population and honor\n\nhousing unit.\n\n       Five days later, on May 24, 2005, Defendant Haeberlin, the warden at KSP, advised Evans\n\nby letter that the stick tests were under review. On May 26, 2005, the May 19 samples were sent to\n\nAegis for further review, with “Reasonable Cause” listed as the reason for testing. The next day, the\n\nlab reports from Aegis were reviewed, and they were negative for drugs. That same day, after nine\n\ndays of segregation in 7 Cellhouse, Evans and DeBow were released.\n\n       Defendants contend that Evans and DeBow were tested pursuant to KSP’s random testing\n\npolicy. A May 4, 2005 memorandum from Defendant Captain Junior Ross, the drug screen\n\ncoordinator at KSP, provides the following:\n\n       Attached is the random list of Drug Screen Inmates for May, 2005. Please assign\n       trained staff to conduct these tests. We are required to test 10% of the population.\n       This list contains 126 names to allow for transfers and releases and still meet the\n       required 84 tests. You need to have the drug-screens completed no later than the\n       20th[] of the month. Please forward all Employer copies of the urine samples\n       paperwork to Administrative Supervisor[.] The inmate donor gets the green copy,\n       the front blue copy goes with the specimen, and all other copies come to me . . . .\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n\n       Note: Starting last month 50% of all drug screens are done by using the (AEGIS)\n       Specimen collection kit and completed by the Lab, the other 50% will be done by\n       using (Redwood Bioteck) test device.\n\n(Memorandum, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 56 Ex. 7.) The “random list,” which was generated by a\n\ncomputer in Frankfort, Kentucky and not by anyone at the facility, included Evans and DeBow, but\n\nnot Sublett.\n\n       Evans was tested again on July 4, 2005, fourteen days after filing a grievance. He was also\n\non the random list that month. The lab results from the July test were negative for drugs, but this\n\ntime the reason listed for testing was “Random.” Evans was also tested, with negative results, on\n\nSeptember 25, 2005 and March 9, 2008. The lab results from the September test did not include a\n\nreason for testing, and those from the March test stated “Random.”\n\n       B. Procedural History\n\n       Evans and six other pro se prisoners filed suit in the United States District Court for the\n\nWestern District of Kentucky under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their state and federal\n\nrights. All plaintiffs but Evans have since been dismissed from the action. After the district court’s\n\ninitial review under the Prison Reform Litigation Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, Evans was allowed to\n\nproceed on the following claims:\n\n       [His] Fourteenth Amendment due process claim arising out of the positive stick test\n       resulting in his placement in segregation against Defendant KSP Captain Junior Ross\n       in his individual and official capacity;\n\n       [His] Eighth Amendment claim pertaining to his placement in segregation against\n       Defendant KSP Corrections Officers Harry Christopher Vinson and Joe Keene in\n       their individual capacities and against Defendants KSP Procedures Officer Byron\n       Jasis, KSP Deputy Warden of Programs Nancy Doom, KSP Deputy Warden for\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n       Security Rick Pershing, and KSP Warden Glenn Haeberlin in their individual and\n       official capacities;\n\n       [His] Eighth and Fourth Amendment claims regarding the reasonableness of the urine\n       tests/selection process against Defendants Vinson and Keene in their individual\n       capacities and against Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin in their individual\n       and official capacities; and\n\n       [His] retaliation claims against Defendants Vinson and Keene in their individual\n       capacities and Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin in their individual and\n       official capacities.\n\n(Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 1-2.) After discovery, the district court granted\n\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all claims. Evans filed this appeal.\n\n                                         II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n\n       We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Gen. Motors Corp. v.\n\nLanard Toys, Inc., 468 F.3d 405, 412 (6th Cir. 2006). A moving party is entitled to summary\n\njudgment “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmovant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Binay v. Bettendorf, 601 F.3d 640, 646 (6th\n\nCir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a summary judgment motion, we view\n\nthe evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty. Id. (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986)).\n\n       Evans brings his claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To succeed on a § 1983 claim, Evans must\n\ndemonstrate that a person acting under color of state law “deprived [him] of rights, privileges or\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nimmunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.” Bennett v. City of\n\nEastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n        B. Monetary Claims Against Defendants in their Official Capacities\n\n        Evans brought suit against Ross in his official capacity only, and against Jasis, Doom,\n\nPershing, and Haeberlin in both their individual and official capacities. To the extent Evans seeks\n\nmonetary damages from these defendants in their official capacities, his claims are barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment. Thiokol Corp. v. Dep’t of Treas., 987 F.2d 376, 381 (6th Cir. 1993). As a\n\nresult, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment on these claims. However, to\n\nthe extent Evans seeks injunctive relief against these defendants in their official capacities, the suit\n\nmay proceed. Cf. Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 n.10 (1989) (“[O]fficial-\n\ncapacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.”).\n\n        C. Constitutional Claims\n\n        The district court found that summary judgment was appropriate because the evidence taken\n\nin the light most favorable to Evans did not establish a constitutional violation on any of Evans’s five\n\nclaims. We consider each of Evans’s claims in turn.\n\n                1. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process\n\n        Evans first argues that Defendants’ act of placing him in administrative segregation based\n\non the positive result of his stick test deprived him of liberty without due process of law. Defendants\n\nrespond that placement in administrative segregation does not constitute an actionable deprivation\n\nof liberty under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Evans has not met his burden of establishing\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nthat he had a liberty interest in avoiding temporary placement in administrative segregation, his due\n\nprocess claim fails.\n\n        The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “protects persons against deprivations\n\nof life, liberty, or property.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005). “A liberty interest may\n\narise from the Constitution itself, by reason of the guarantees implicit in the word ‘liberty,’ or it may\n\narise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nBecause “lawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges\n\nand rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system,” prisoners have\n\nlimited liberty interests. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485 (1995). Although “[t]he Constitution\n\nitself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of\n\nconfinement,” the Supreme Court has held that “a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions\n\nof confinement may arise from state policies or regulations.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 221-22.\n\n        “[T]he touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest\n\nin avoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those\n\nconditions but the nature of those conditions themselves ‘in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life.’” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 222 (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484). When a restraint does\n\nnot lengthen a sentence, the appropriate inquiry is whether it “imposes atypical and significant\n\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n\n        There is no evidence in the record about the conditions Evans faced in administrative\n\nsegregation. While Evans detailed the conditions of his confinement in his response to the motion\n\nfor summary judgment, he did not, as the district court acknowledged, “provide these details under\n\n                                                  -7-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\npenalty of perjury, in his verified complaint, or in his affidavit attached to his response.” (Mem. Op.\n\n& Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 4 n.4.) As a result of Evans’s failure to meet his burden of\n\nproduction, we are unable to review whether Evans’s transfer to administrative segregation imposed\n\nan atypical and significant hardship. Defendants are thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and\n\nthe district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim.\n\n               2. Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\n       Evans’s second claim is that Defendants violated the Eighth Amendment when they subjected\n\nhim to a strip search, haircut, and shave upon his entry into administrative segregation. The Eighth\n\nAmendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment protects prisoners from the “unnecessary\n\nand wanton infliction of pain.” Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The district court treated Evans’s Eighth Amendment argument as a conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claim; however, it may also be interpreted as a claim of excessive force. Under either\n\nstandard, Evans has failed to assert a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n       A conditions-of-confinement claim has two elements: a sufficiently serious deprivation and\n\nprison officials’ deliberate indifference to the prisoner’s health or safety. Spencer v. Bouchard, 449\n\nF.3d 721, 728 (6th Cir. 2006). A deprivation is sufficiently serious when it “result[s] in the denial\n\nof the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.” Id. (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294,\n\n302-03 (1991)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Although the list is not exhaustive, we have found\n\nthe minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities to include food, clothing, shelter, medical\n\ntreatment, and reasonable safety. See id. at 727 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832\n\n(1994)). The district court found that Evans’s complaints of a strip search, haircut, and shave failed\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nto demonstrate a sufficiently serious deprivation. We agree. Evans has not asserted that he was\n\ndenied any basic human needs while in administrative segregation, and his conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claim thus fails.\n\n       Evans has likewise failed to make out a valid claim of excessive force. “The Eighth\n\nAmendment’s prohibition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily excludes from\n\nconstitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of\n\na sort ‘repugnant to the conscience of mankind.’” Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1992)\n\n(quoting Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327). Here, the force asserted to search Evans and remove his hair was\n\nminor, and not the type to invoke Eighth Amendment protection. The district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Defendants on this claim.\n\n               3. Fourth Amendment Reasonableness of the Search\n\n       Next, Evans argues that the stick test constituted an unreasonable search in violation of his\n\nFourth Amendment rights. Although drug tests constitute searches within the ambit of Fourth\n\nAmendment protection, see Pendleton v. Vance, No. 94-6468, 1995 WL 592048, at *2 (6th Cir. Oct.\n\n5, 1995) (unpublished disposition) (citing Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617-20\n\n(1989)), drug tests conducted under a prison policy of randomized testing pass Fourth Amendment\n\nscrutiny because they are rationally related to legitimate government interests, see Gibbs v. Johnson,\n\nNo. 95-1339, 1995 WL 739470, at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 12, 1995) (unpublished disposition) (citing\n\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-91 (1987)); accord Lucero v. Gunter, 52 F.3d 874, 877 (10th Cir.\n\n1995). Non-random searches are constitutional if they are reasonable. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n\n520, 559 (1979).\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n        Evans argues that he was not searched pursuant to the random-testing policy, pointing to the\n\nevidence that, although he was on the randomly generated list of inmates who might be subject to\n\na drug test in May, the report from Aegis listed “Reasonable Cause” as the basis for his test. This\n\nevidence, along with the evidence referenced in section II.C.5, is sufficient to create a genuine issue\n\nof fact concerning whether Evans was tested in accordance with the policy authorizing randomized\n\ndrug tests. The district court pushed this factual dispute to the side, stating:\n\n        While Plaintiff makes much of the reasons for testing listed on the Aegis lab reports,\n        Plaintiff, nonetheless, concedes that he was on the random computer-generated lists.\n        That KSP officers may have some leeway in choosing 84 inmates from the list of 126\n        to account for those transferred or released prisoners or that Plaintiff was tested on\n        three occasions in 2005 does not cause the Court to find that the testing process is\n        unreasonable or otherwise allows for repeated harassment by KSP personnel.\n\n(Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 14.) The pertinent question, however, is not\n\nwhether the testing process in general was reasonable, but whether the drug test administered to\n\nEvans on May 19, 2005 was reasonable. The district court seems to rely on a theory akin to\n\ninevitable discovery—that is, that the drug test would have been administered to Evans because he\n\nwas on the random list. But testing was not inevitable under the circumstances—only two-thirds of\n\nprisoners on the random list are actually tested in a given month. So while it was likely that Evans\n\nwould have been tested, it was not a foregone conclusion. Moreover, inevitable discovery is a\n\ndoctrine relating to the exclusionary rule; it does not speak to the legality of the search itself and is\n\nthus inapplicable to the § 1983 context. Cf. Nix v. United States, 467 U.S. 431, 443-44 (1984).\n\nFinally, the Supreme Court has indicated that, although the subjective motivation and reasoning of\n\nthe officer undertaking the search is not relevant where the search is otherwise supported by probable\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ncause, the true purpose of the search does matter when the only support for the search is\n\nadministrative. See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 811 (1996). For that reason, the random\n\npolicy can justify the search only if it was actually undertaken pursuant to that policy. Because there\n\nis a genuine question of material fact on that issue, and because Defendants have not asserted that\n\nthe search was reasonable on some other basis, we find that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment on Evans’s Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n               4. Eighth Amendment Harassment\n\n       Evans also argues that Defendants administered the May 2005 drug test to him solely for\n\nharassment purposes, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Prisoners retain a remedy for\n\n“calculated harassment unrelated to prison needs.” Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 530 (1984).\n\nThe district court cited the Seventh Circuit’s pronouncement that “the Eighth Amendment’s\n\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment stands as a protection from bodily searches which\n\nare maliciously motivated, unrelated to institutional security, and hence ‘totally without penological\n\njustification.’” Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 418 (7th Cir. 1987) (quoting Rhodes v.\n\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981)). However, we have neither adopted nor cited our sister\n\ncircuit’s rule, and the Supreme Court has stated that even punishments that are “totally without\n\npenological justification” do not violate the Eighth Amendment unless they inflict some level of\n\npain. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346. Because Evans has failed to make out a cognizable claim, the district\n\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment to Defendants on this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n               5. First Amendment Retaliation\n\n       Finally, Evans claims that he was tested and placed in administrative segregation in\n\nretaliation for assisting Sublett in filing a complaint with the prison administration. There are three\n\nelements to a retaliation claim:\n\n       (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against\n       the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage\n       in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and\n       two—that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff’s\n       protected conduct.\n\nThaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 F.3d 378, 394 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (plurality opinion). We review\n\neach element in turn.\n\n                        a. Protected Conduct\n\n       The first question is whether Evans engaged in protected conduct. Although there is no\n\nconstitutional right to assist other prisoners with legal matters, “prisoners are entitled to receive\n\nassistance from jailhouse lawyers where no reasonable alternatives are present and to deny this\n\nassistance denies the constitutional right of access to the courts.” Gibbs v. Hopkins, 10 F.3d 373,\n\n378 (6th Cir. 1993). Thus, “prison officials may not prevent such assistance or retaliate for\n\nproviding such assistance where no reasonable alternatives are available.” Id. Evans has not alleged\n\nor presented evidence tending to show that Sublett was unable to file his own complaint or\n\ngrievance, or that Evans’s help was otherwise necessary. However, in Gibbs, this Court remanded\n\nto allow the plaintiff, who was in a similar situation, to amend his complaint to make such an\n\nallegation. 10 F.3d at 379-80. Evans maintains that he is a qualified legal aide who has completed\n\nseveral hours of training, that he is required to help anyone who comes to him for legal assistance,\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nand that Sublett was in segregation and requested Evans’s assistance. Given the liberal pleading\n\nstandard applied to pro se litigants, see Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 395 (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429\n\nU.S. 97, 106 (1976)), and our precedent in Gibbs, and assuming that Evans has established the\n\nremaining elements of his claim, we find it equitable to reverse the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on this claim and remand to allow Evans to amend his complaint and present evidence that\n\nSublett had no reasonable alternative to his assistance.\n\n       In addition, we take this opportunity to correct the district court’s unduly restrictive statement\n\nof the law: “[E]ven if Plaintiff Sublett was somehow prevented from filing a complaint/grievance\n\nwhile segregated, Plaintiff Evans’ [sic] fails to show that his assistance, as opposed to Grievance\n\nAide DeBow’s or another legal aide’s assistance, was necessary to vindicate Plaintiff Sublett’s right\n\nto access the courts.” (Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 18.) While there must be a\n\nshowing that the “individual prisoner’s right to access the courts has been impaired,” Thaddeus-X,\n\n175 F.3d at 396 n.11 (citing Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996)), we have not held, nor can it be\n\ntrue, that the prisoner must need assistance from the particular plaintiff at issue. Cf. Gibbs, 10 F.3d\n\nat 378-80. If a prisoner needs assistance in filing his legal documents, and any legal aide would be\n\nretaliated against for providing assistance and is therefore deterred from doing so, it matters not\n\nwhether there is one qualified aide or ten; retaliation against the aide who chooses to help still\n\nprevents the prisoner from accessing the courts, and the aide thus has a derivative claim for\n\nretaliation. Cf. Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 395 (stating that “a ‘jailhouse lawyer’s’ right to assist\n\nanother prisoner is wholly derivative of that prisoner’s right of access to the courts”). As a result,\n\non remand Evans may establish protected conduct by proving not that he was the only person who\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ncould assist Sublett, but that Sublett needed assistance and had no reasonable alternative but to seek\n\nthat assistance from another prisoner.\n\n                       b. Adverse Action\n\n       The second requirement is an adverse action. In the prison context, an adverse action is “an\n\naction comparable to transfer to administrative segregation,” or an “action[] of lesser severity” that\n\n“would ‘deter a person of ordinary firmness’ from the exercise of the right at stake.” Thaddeus-X,\n\n175 F.3d at 397 (quoting Bart v. Telford, 677 F.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir. 1982)). It is undisputed that\n\nEvans was administered a drug test and placed in administrative segregation pending investigation\n\ninto possible drug activity. Evans contends that Defendants also did not maintain the proper chain\n\nof custody for that test. These contentions are supported by evidence in the record and sufficient to\n\ndeter a person of ordinary firmness from assisting other prisoners in filing legal complaints and\n\ngrievances.\n\n                       c. Causal Connection\n\n       The final requirement is a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction. This element comes from the familiar test in Mount Healthy City School District Board of\n\nEducation v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), and is met where the plaintiff establishes that his protected\n\nconduct was a “motivating factor” in the adverse action. Id. at 287 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399. The burden of production then shifts to the\n\ndefendant to “show that he would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected\n\nactivity.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399. We assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that on\n\nremand Evans could show that his assistance of Sublett was protected conduct.\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n       As examined above in section II.C.3, there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the\n\nactual reason for Evans’s drug test was his presence on the random testing list. From the listing of\n\n“reasonable cause” on Evans’s testing form, the date of testing only two days after his assistance was\n\nrendered and on the day Sublett was released, the delay in sending the results to the lab, his\n\nplacement in 7 Cellhouse instead of 3 Cellhouse, the fact that others involved in the assistance were\n\nalso tested and had “reasonable cause” listed as the purpose, and the failure to allow Evans to\n\nobserve that proper testing procedures were followed and the chain of custody remained intact, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that Evans’s protected conduct was a motivating factor in\n\nDefendants’ administration of the drug test and extended placement of Evans in administrative\n\nsegregation. This evidence also rebuts Defendants’ claim that they would have taken the adverse\n\naction in the absence of the protected conduct, and is sufficient to preclude summary judgment on\n\nthis claim.\n\n       Because Evans has otherwise made out a viable claim of First Amendment retaliation, we\n\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remand to allow Evans to amend the\n\ncomplaint and present evidence that Sublett had no reasonable alternatives to another prisoner’s\n\nassistance.\n\n       D. Qualified Immunity\n\n       Although the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Evans establishes that\n\nDefendants violated Evans’s First and Fourth Amendment rights, Defendants may still be entitled\n\nto qualified immunity if the constitutional rights at issue were not clearly established at the time of\n\ntheir conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Defendants asserted the defense of\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nqualified immunity both below and on appeal; however, they did so in both instances in a one-and-a-\n\nhalf page statement of the law with no attempt at argument, and they cited only the first prong of the\n\ntest: whether their alleged conduct violated a constitutional right. Defendants have failed to argue\n\nthat the rights at issue were not clearly established, and as a result they have waived that defense.\n\nSee Hills v. Kentucky, 457 F.3d 583, 588 (6th Cir. 2006) (accepting the district court’s conclusion\n\nfor the first step in the qualified immunity analysis where the defendant made no attempt to explain\n\nwhere the district court erred); Spirko v. Mitchell, 368 F.3d 603, 612 (6th Cir. 2004) (“It is a ‘settled\n\nappellate rule that issues averred to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.’” (quoting United States v. Elder, 90 F.3d 1110, 1118\n\n(6th Cir. 1996)).\n\n        E. Untimely Filing of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n        Finally, Evans argues that the district court erred by allowing Defendants to file their motion\n\nfor summary judgment after the allotted time for filing dispositive motions had lapsed. This\n\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n        The original deadline for dispositive motions was August 13, 2008. On that day, Defendants\n\nmoved for an extension, which the district court granted. The new deadline was September 12,\n\n2008. On September 19, 2008, Defendants moved for leave to file their motion for summary\n\njudgment out of time within the next fifteen days, stating as the reason for the delay that the district\n\ncourt had not ruled on a motion for removal of one of the plaintiffs in the action until September 18,\n\n2008. The district court granted that motion on March 27, 2009, finding that “Defendants ha[d]\n\nshown good cause for filing their motion for summary judgment within 20 days after its original due\n\n                                                 - 16 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ndate and Plaintiff ha[d] shown no prejudice by this minor delay.” (Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 64,\n\nat 1.)\n\n         “When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause,\n\nextend the time . . . on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of\n\nexcusable neglect.” Fed R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1). We review the district court’s determination of\n\nexcusable neglect for abuse of discretion. Nafziger v. McDermott Int’l, Inc., 467 F.3d 514, 522 (6th\n\nCir. 2006). In granting Defendants’ motion, the district court cited the short length of the delay, the\n\nlack of prejudice to Evans, and that the delay was for good cause—all appropriate considerations\n\nweighing in favor of finding excusable neglect, see id. (citing Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick\n\nAssocs. Ltd. P’ship, 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993)). Evans has not explained how the district court\n\nabused its discretion in granting Defendants’ motion for leave to file out of time. His contention that\n\nsummary judgment should be denied based on Defendants’ failure to comply with the briefing\n\nschedule thus fails.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE district court’s grant of summary judgment as to\n\nEvans’s First Amendment retaliation and Fourth Amendment unreasonable-search claims against\n\nDefendants in their individual capacities—and their official capacities to the extent injunctive relief\n\nis sought— AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in all other respects, and REMAND the case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f",

Only two days after assisting another prisoner in filing a grievance,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant William Evans was placed in administrative segregation for nine days due to a\n\nfalse-positive drug test. Evans then filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit against seven prison\n\nofficials—Defendants-Appellees Harry Christopher Vinson, Nancy Doom, Glenn Haeberlin, Byron\n\nJasis, Joe Keene, Rick Pershing, and Junior Ross—alleging violations of Evans’s First, Fourth,\n\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court granted Defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment; Evans appeals. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE\n\nin part, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       The original seven plaintiffs in this case, Alando Sublett, James DeBow, William Evans,\n\nDaniel Lindsey, Donnie Ashby, Aaron Burnett, and James Dunn, were all incarcerated at the\n\nKentucky State Penitentiary (“KSP”) in May 2005. Evans is the only plaintiff remaining in the suit.\n\nThe relevant facts, taken in the light most favorable to Evans, are as follows:\n\n       On May 17, 2005, Sublett was given a “stick test”—a urine test used in the field to screen\n\nfor illegal drug use—by Defendant Vinson, a correctional officer at KSP, and another officer.\n\nVinson, displeased with the results, allegedly destroyed Sublett’s first sample and ordered another\n\nwith a different witness. Sublett was then sent to his cell without an opportunity to witness the\n\nsealing of the sample or its chain of custody, which is inconsistent with the process usually followed\n\nfor administering drug tests at KSP. Half an hour later, Sublett was placed in administrative\n\nsegregation in “3 Cellhouse” as a result of the stick test, which Defendants claimed was positive.\n\nDefendants sent an additional sample to Aegis Sciences Corporation (“Aegis”) for confirmation.\n\n       On May 18, 2005, DeBow, an inmate grievance aide, received a message about the incident\n\nand approached Evans, an inmate legal aide, about assisting Sublett in getting released. Evans sent\n\na memorandum to Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin requesting Sublett’s release on due\n\nprocess grounds.\n\n       On May 19, 2005, Defendants received the lab report from Aegis showing that Sublett had\n\ntested negative for drug use, and Sublett was released from segregation. That same day, Vinson\n\nadministered stick tests to DeBow and Evans, and Defendant Keene, the deputy warden for security\n\n                                                -2-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nat KSP, served as a witness. Following the tests, DeBow and Evans were ordered to return to their\n\ncells. Approximately forty-five minutes later, they were placed in the “‘Super Max’ Administrative\n\nSegregation Unit (7 Cellhouse)” based on allegedly positive stick tests. The May 19, 2005 detention\n\norder stated that Evans was “being placed in 7 Cellhouse Admin. Seg. for investigation into Illegal\n\nDrug Activity within the institution. This action was taken for the Safety of Staff and inmates, and\n\nthe safe and secure operation of this institution.” (Detention Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71 Ex. 2.)\n\nWhile in 7 Cellhouse, Evans was subjected to a nude strip search, haircut, and shave, and restricted\n\nfrom his job as a legal aide and all of the privileges he enjoyed in the general population and honor\n\nhousing unit.\n\n       Five days later, on May 24, 2005, Defendant Haeberlin, the warden at KSP, advised Evans\n\nby letter that the stick tests were under review. On May 26, 2005, the May 19 samples were sent to\n\nAegis for further review, with “Reasonable Cause” listed as the reason for testing. The next day, the\n\nlab reports from Aegis were reviewed, and they were negative for drugs. That same day, after nine\n\ndays of segregation in 7 Cellhouse, Evans and DeBow were released.\n\n       Defendants contend that Evans and DeBow were tested pursuant to KSP’s random testing\n\npolicy. A May 4, 2005 memorandum from Defendant Captain Junior Ross, the drug screen\n\ncoordinator at KSP, provides the following:\n\n       Attached is the random list of Drug Screen Inmates for May, 2005. Please assign\n       trained staff to conduct these tests. We are required to test 10% of the population.\n       This list contains 126 names to allow for transfers and releases and still meet the\n       required 84 tests. You need to have the drug-screens completed no later than the\n       20th[] of the month. Please forward all Employer copies of the urine samples\n       paperwork to Administrative Supervisor[.] The inmate donor gets the green copy,\n       the front blue copy goes with the specimen, and all other copies come to me . . . .\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n\n       Note: Starting last month 50% of all drug screens are done by using the (AEGIS)\n       Specimen collection kit and completed by the Lab, the other 50% will be done by\n       using (Redwood Bioteck) test device.\n\n(Memorandum, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 56 Ex. 7.) The “random list,” which was generated by a\n\ncomputer in Frankfort, Kentucky and not by anyone at the facility, included Evans and DeBow, but\n\nnot Sublett.\n\n       Evans was tested again on July 4, 2005, fourteen days after filing a grievance. He was also\n\non the random list that month. The lab results from the July test were negative for drugs, but this\n\ntime the reason listed for testing was “Random.” Evans was also tested, with negative results, on\n\nSeptember 25, 2005 and March 9, 2008. The lab results from the September test did not include a\n\nreason for testing, and those from the March test stated “Random.”\n\n       B. Procedural History\n\n       Evans and six other pro se prisoners filed suit in the United States District Court for the\n\nWestern District of Kentucky under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their state and federal\n\nrights. All plaintiffs but Evans have since been dismissed from the action. After the district court’s\n\ninitial review under the Prison Reform Litigation Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, Evans was allowed to\n\nproceed on the following claims:\n\n       [His] Fourteenth Amendment due process claim arising out of the positive stick test\n       resulting in his placement in segregation against Defendant KSP Captain Junior Ross\n       in his individual and official capacity;\n\n       [His] Eighth Amendment claim pertaining to his placement in segregation against\n       Defendant KSP Corrections Officers Harry Christopher Vinson and Joe Keene in\n       their individual capacities and against Defendants KSP Procedures Officer Byron\n       Jasis, KSP Deputy Warden of Programs Nancy Doom, KSP Deputy Warden for\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n       Security Rick Pershing, and KSP Warden Glenn Haeberlin in their individual and\n       official capacities;\n\n       [His] Eighth and Fourth Amendment claims regarding the reasonableness of the urine\n       tests/selection process against Defendants Vinson and Keene in their individual\n       capacities and against Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin in their individual\n       and official capacities; and\n\n       [His] retaliation claims against Defendants Vinson and Keene in their individual\n       capacities and Defendants Pershing, Jasis, and Haeberlin in their individual and\n       official capacities.\n\n(Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 1-2.) After discovery, the district court granted\n\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all claims. Evans filed this appeal.\n\n                                         II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n\n       We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Gen.

A moving party is entitled to summary\n\njudgment “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmovant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Binay v.

In reviewing a summary judgment motion, we view\n\nthe evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty. Id. (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (1986)).\n\n       Evans brings his claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Monetary Claims Against Defendants in their Official Capacities\n\n        Evans brought suit against Ross in his official capacity only, and against Jasis, Doom,\n\nPershing, and Haeberlin in both their individual and official capacities. To the extent Evans seeks\n\nmonetary damages from these defendants in their official capacities, his claims are barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment. Thiokol Corp. v. Dep’t of Treas., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601528\"><a href=\"/opinion/601528/thiokol-corporation-morton-international-inc-as-successors-through/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381 (6th Cir. 1993). As a\n\nresult, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment on these claims. However, to\n\nthe extent Evans seeks injunctive relief against these defendants in their official capacities, the suit\n\nmay proceed. Cf. Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 n.10 (1989) (“[O]fficial-\n\ncapacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.”).\n\n        C. Constitutional Claims\n\n        The district court found that summary judgment was appropriate because the evidence taken\n\nin the light most favorable to Evans did not establish a constitutional violation on any of Evans’s five\n\nclaims. We consider each of Evans’s claims in turn.\n\n                1. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process\n\n        Evans first argues that Defendants’ act of placing him in administrative segregation based\n\non the positive result of his stick test deprived him of liberty without due process of law. Defendants\n\nrespond that placement in administrative segregation does not constitute an actionable deprivation\n\nof liberty under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Evans has not met his burden of establishing\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nthat he had a liberty interest in avoiding temporary placement in administrative segregation, his due\n\nprocess claim fails.\n\n        The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “protects persons against deprivations\n\nof life, liberty, or property.” Wilkinson v. Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (2005). “A liberty interest may\n\narise from the Constitution itself, by reason of the guarantees implicit in the word ‘liberty,’ or it may\n\narise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nBecause “lawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges\n\nand rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system,” prisoners have\n\nlimited liberty interests. Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1995). Although “[t]he Constitution\n\nitself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of\n\nconfinement,” the Supreme Court has held that “a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions\n\nof confinement may arise from state policies or regulations.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 221-22.\n\n        “[T]he touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest\n\nin avoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those\n\nconditions but the nature of those conditions themselves ‘in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life.’” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 222 (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484). When a restraint does\n\nnot lengthen a sentence, the appropriate inquiry is whether it “imposes atypical and significant\n\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n\n        There is no evidence in the record about the conditions Evans faced in administrative\n\nsegregation. While Evans detailed the conditions of his confinement in his response to the motion\n\nfor summary judgment, he did not, as the district court acknowledged, “provide these details under\n\n                                                  -7-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\npenalty of perjury, in his verified complaint, or in his affidavit attached to his response.” (Mem. Op.\n\n& Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 4 n.4.) As a result of Evans’s failure to meet his burden of\n\nproduction, we are unable to review whether Evans’s transfer to administrative segregation imposed\n\nan atypical and significant hardship. Defendants are thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and\n\nthe district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim.\n\n               2. Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\n       Evans’s second claim is that Defendants violated the Eighth Amendment when they subjected\n\nhim to a strip search, haircut, and shave upon his entry into administrative segregation. The Eighth\n\nAmendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment protects prisoners from the “unnecessary\n\nand wanton infliction of pain.” Whitley v. Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1986) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The district court treated Evans’s Eighth Amendment argument as a conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claim; however, it may also be interpreted as a claim of excessive force. Under either\n\nstandard, Evans has failed to assert a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n       A conditions-of-confinement claim has two elements: a sufficiently serious deprivation and\n\nprison officials’ deliberate indifference to the prisoner’s health or safety. Spencer v. Bouchard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794493\"><a href=\"/opinion/794493/william-sim-spencer-v-michael-j-bouchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728 (6th Cir. 2006). A deprivation is sufficiently serious when it “result[s] in the denial\n\nof the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.” Id. (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n302-03 (1991)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Although the list is not exhaustive, we have found\n\nthe minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities to include food, clothing, shelter, medical\n\ntreatment, and reasonable safety. See id. at 727 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832\n\n(1994)). The district court found that Evans’s complaints of a strip search, haircut, and shave failed\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nto demonstrate a sufficiently serious deprivation. We agree. Evans has not asserted that he was\n\ndenied any basic human needs while in administrative segregation, and his conditions-of-\n\nconfinement claim thus fails.\n\n       Evans has likewise failed to make out a valid claim of excessive force. “The Eighth\n\nAmendment’s prohibition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily excludes from\n\nconstitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of\n\na sort ‘repugnant to the conscience of mankind.’” Hudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9-10 (1992)\n\n(quoting Whitley, 475 U.S. at 327). Here, the force asserted to search Evans and remove his hair was\n\nminor, and not the type to invoke Eighth Amendment protection. The district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Defendants on this claim.\n\n               3. Fourth Amendment Reasonableness of the Search\n\n       Next, Evans argues that the stick test constituted an unreasonable search in violation of his\n\nFourth Amendment rights. Although drug tests constitute searches within the ambit of Fourth\n\nAmendment protection, see Pendleton v. Vance, No. 94-6468, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">592048</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (6th Cir.

Non-random searches are constitutional if they are reasonable. See Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (1979).\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n        Evans argues that he was not searched pursuant to the random-testing policy, pointing to the\n\nevidence that, although he was on the randomly generated list of inmates who might be subject to\n\na drug test in May, the report from Aegis listed “Reasonable Cause” as the basis for his test. This\n\nevidence, along with the evidence referenced in section II.C.5, is sufficient to create a genuine issue\n\nof fact concerning whether Evans was tested in accordance with the policy authorizing randomized\n\ndrug tests. The district court pushed this factual dispute to the side, stating:\n\n        While Plaintiff makes much of the reasons for testing listed on the Aegis lab reports,\n        Plaintiff, nonetheless, concedes that he was on the random computer-generated lists.\n        That KSP officers may have some leeway in choosing 84 inmates from the list of 126\n        to account for those transferred or released prisoners or that Plaintiff was tested on\n        three occasions in 2005 does not cause the Court to find that the testing process is\n        unreasonable or otherwise allows for repeated harassment by KSP personnel.\n\n(Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 14.) The pertinent question, however, is not\n\nwhether the testing process in general was reasonable, but whether the drug test administered to\n\nEvans on May 19, 2005 was reasonable. The district court seems to rely on a theory akin to\n\ninevitable discovery—that is, that the drug test would have been administered to Evans because he\n\nwas on the random list. But testing was not inevitable under the circumstances—only two-thirds of\n\nprisoners on the random list are actually tested in a given month. So while it was likely that Evans\n\nwould have been tested, it was not a foregone conclusion. Moreover, inevitable discovery is a\n\ndoctrine relating to the exclusionary rule; it does not speak to the legality of the search itself and is\n\nthus inapplicable to the § 1983 context. Cf. Nix v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111204\"><a href=\"/opinion/111204/nix-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443-44 (1984).\n\nFinally, the Supreme Court has indicated that, although the subjective motivation and reasoning of\n\nthe officer undertaking the search is not relevant where the search is otherwise supported by probable\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ncause, the true purpose of the search does matter when the only support for the search is\n\nadministrative. See Whren v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (1996). For that reason, the random\n\npolicy can justify the search only if it was actually undertaken pursuant to that policy. Because there\n\nis a genuine question of material fact on that issue, and because Defendants have not asserted that\n\nthe search was reasonable on some other basis, we find that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment on Evans’s Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n               4. Eighth Amendment Harassment\n\n       Evans also argues that Defendants administered the May 2005 drug test to him solely for\n\nharassment purposes, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Prisoners retain a remedy for\n\n“calculated harassment unrelated to prison needs.” Hudson v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1984).\n\nThe district court cited the Seventh Circuit’s pronouncement that “the Eighth Amendment’s\n\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment stands as a protection from bodily searches which\n\nare maliciously motivated, unrelated to institutional security, and hence ‘totally without penological\n\njustification.’” Meriwether v. Faulkner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490012\"><a href=\"/opinion/490012/lavarita-d-meriwether-v-gordon-h-faulkner/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (7th Cir. 1987) (quoting Rhodes v.\n\nChapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1981)). However, we have neither adopted nor cited our sister\n\ncircuit’s rule, and the Supreme Court has stated that even punishments that are “totally without\n\npenological justification” do not violate the Eighth Amendment unless they inflict some level of\n\npain. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 346. Because Evans has failed to make out a cognizable claim, the district\n\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment to Defendants on this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n               5. First Amendment Retaliation\n\n       Finally, Evans claims that he was tested and placed in administrative segregation in\n\nretaliation for assisting Sublett in filing a complaint with the prison administration. There are three\n\nelements to a retaliation claim:\n\n       (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against\n       the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage\n       in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and\n       two—that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff’s\n       protected conduct.\n\nThaddeus-X v. Blatter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763587\"><a href=\"/opinion/763587/thaddeus-x-and-earnest-bell-jr-v-blatter/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (plurality opinion). We review\n\neach element in turn.\n\n                        a. Protected Conduct\n\n       The first question is whether Evans engaged in protected conduct. Although there is no\n\nconstitutional right to assist other prisoners with legal matters, “prisoners are entitled to receive\n\nassistance from jailhouse lawyers where no reasonable alternatives are present and to deny this\n\nassistance denies the constitutional right of access to the courts.” Gibbs v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658134\"><a href=\"/opinion/658134/paul-d-gibbs-v-robert-j-hopkins-pat-leavenworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n378 (6th Cir. 1993). Thus, “prison officials may not prevent such assistance or retaliate for\n\nproviding such assistance where no reasonable alternatives are available.” Id. Evans has not alleged\n\nor presented evidence tending to show that Sublett was unable to file his own complaint or\n\ngrievance, or that Evans’s help was otherwise necessary. However, in Gibbs, this Court remanded\n\nto allow the plaintiff, who was in a similar situation, to amend his complaint to make such an\n\nallegation. 10 F.3d at 379-80. Evans maintains that he is a qualified legal aide who has completed\n\nseveral hours of training, that he is required to help anyone who comes to him for legal assistance,\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nand that Sublett was in segregation and requested Evans’s assistance. Given the liberal pleading\n\nstandard applied to pro se litigants, see Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 395 (citing Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (1976)), and our precedent in Gibbs, and assuming that Evans has established the\n\nremaining elements of his claim, we find it equitable to reverse the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on this claim and remand to allow Evans to amend his complaint and present evidence that\n\nSublett had no reasonable alternative to his assistance.\n\n       In addition, we take this opportunity to correct the district court’s unduly restrictive statement\n\nof the law: “[E]ven if Plaintiff Sublett was somehow prevented from filing a complaint/grievance\n\nwhile segregated, Plaintiff Evans’ [sic] fails to show that his assistance, as opposed to Grievance\n\nAide DeBow’s or another legal aide’s assistance, was necessary to vindicate Plaintiff Sublett’s right\n\nto access the courts.” (Mem. Op. & Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 71, at 18.) While there must be a\n\nshowing that the “individual prisoner’s right to access the courts has been impaired,” Thaddeus-X,\n\n175 F.3d at 396 n.11 (citing Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996)), we have not held, nor can it be\n\ntrue, that the prisoner must need assistance from the particular plaintiff at issue. Cf. Gibbs, 10 F.3d\n\nat 378-80. If a prisoner needs assistance in filing his legal documents, and any legal aide would be\n\nretaliated against for providing assistance and is therefore deterred from doing so, it matters not\n\nwhether there is one qualified aide or ten; retaliation against the aide who chooses to help still\n\nprevents the prisoner from accessing the courts, and the aide thus has a derivative claim for\n\nretaliation. Cf. Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 395 (stating that “a ‘jailhouse lawyer’s’ right to assist\n\nanother prisoner is wholly derivative of that prisoner’s right of access to the courts”). As a result,\n\non remand Evans may establish protected conduct by proving not that he was the only person who\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ncould assist Sublett, but that Sublett needed assistance and had no reasonable alternative but to seek\n\nthat assistance from another prisoner.\n\n                       b. Adverse Action\n\n       The second requirement is an adverse action. In the prison context, an adverse action is “an\n\naction comparable to transfer to administrative segregation,” or an “action[] of lesser severity” that\n\n“would ‘deter a person of ordinary firmness’ from the exercise of the right at stake.” Thaddeus-X,\n\n175 F.3d at 397 (quoting Bart v. Telford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403624\"><a href=\"/opinion/403624/mary-a-bart-v-william-c-telford/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (7th Cir. 1982)). It is undisputed that\n\nEvans was administered a drug test and placed in administrative segregation pending investigation\n\ninto possible drug activity. Evans contends that Defendants also did not maintain the proper chain\n\nof custody for that test. These contentions are supported by evidence in the record and sufficient to\n\ndeter a person of ordinary firmness from assisting other prisoners in filing legal complaints and\n\ngrievances.\n\n                       c. Causal Connection\n\n       The final requirement is a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction. This element comes from the familiar test in Mount Healthy City School District Board of\n\nEducation v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977), and is met where the plaintiff establishes that his protected\n\nconduct was a “motivating factor” in the adverse action. Id. at 287 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399. The burden of production then shifts to the\n\ndefendant to “show that he would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected\n\nactivity.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399. We assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that on\n\nremand Evans could show that his assistance of Sublett was protected conduct.\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\n       As examined above in section II.C.3, there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the\n\nactual reason for Evans’s drug test was his presence on the random testing list. From the listing of\n\n“reasonable cause” on Evans’s testing form, the date of testing only two days after his assistance was\n\nrendered and on the day Sublett was released, the delay in sending the results to the lab, his\n\nplacement in 7 Cellhouse instead of 3 Cellhouse, the fact that others involved in the assistance were\n\nalso tested and had “reasonable cause” listed as the purpose, and the failure to allow Evans to\n\nobserve that proper testing procedures were followed and the chain of custody remained intact, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that Evans’s protected conduct was a motivating factor in\n\nDefendants’ administration of the drug test and extended placement of Evans in administrative\n\nsegregation. This evidence also rebuts Defendants’ claim that they would have taken the adverse\n\naction in the absence of the protected conduct, and is sufficient to preclude summary judgment on\n\nthis claim.\n\n       Because Evans has otherwise made out a viable claim of First Amendment retaliation, we\n\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remand to allow Evans to amend the\n\ncomplaint and present evidence that Sublett had no reasonable alternatives to another prisoner’s\n\nassistance.\n\n       D. Qualified Immunity\n\n       Although the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Evans establishes that\n\nDefendants violated Evans’s First and Fourth Amendment rights, Defendants may still be entitled\n\nto qualified immunity if the constitutional rights at issue were not clearly established at the time of\n\ntheir conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (1982). Defendants asserted the defense of\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\nqualified immunity both below and on appeal; however, they did so in both instances in a one-and-a-\n\nhalf page statement of the law with no attempt at argument, and they cited only the first prong of the\n\ntest: whether their alleged conduct violated a constitutional right. Defendants have failed to argue\n\nthat the rights at issue were not clearly established, and as a result they have waived that defense.\n\nSee Hills v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (6th Cir. 2006) (accepting the district court’s conclusion\n\nfor the first step in the qualified immunity analysis where the defendant made no attempt to explain\n\nwhere the district court erred); Spirko v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786211\"><a href=\"/opinion/786211/john-g-spirko-jr-v-betty-mitchell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (6th Cir. 2004) (“It is a ‘settled\n\nappellate rule that issues averred to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.’” (quoting United States v. Elder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722562\"><a href=\"/opinion/722562/united-states-v-angela-elder-94-5307-douglas-jones-94-5309-david-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118\n\n(6th Cir. 1996)).\n\n        E. Untimely Filing of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n        Finally, Evans argues that the district court erred by allowing Defendants to file their motion\n\nfor summary judgment after the allotted time for filing dispositive motions had lapsed. This\n\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n        The original deadline for dispositive motions was August 13, 2008. On that day, Defendants\n\nmoved for an extension, which the district court granted. The new deadline was September 12,\n\n2008. On September 19, 2008, Defendants moved for leave to file their motion for summary\n\njudgment out of time within the next fifteen days, stating as the reason for the delay that the district\n\ncourt had not ruled on a motion for removal of one of the plaintiffs in the action until September 18,\n\n2008. The district court granted that motion on March 27, 2009, finding that “Defendants ha[d]\n\nshown good cause for filing their motion for summary judgment within 20 days after its original due\n\n                                                 - 16 -\n\fNo. 09-6283\nWilliam Evans v. Harry Vinson, et al.\n\ndate and Plaintiff ha[d] shown no prejudice by this minor delay.” (Order, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 64,\n\nat 1.)\n\n         “When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause,\n\nextend the time . . . on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of\n\nexcusable neglect.” Fed R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1). We review the district court’s determination of\n\nexcusable neglect for abuse of discretion. Nafziger v. McDermott Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (6th\n\nCir. 2006). In granting Defendants’ motion, the district court cited the short length of the delay, the\n\nlack of prejudice to Evans, and that the delay was for good cause—all appropriate considerations\n\nweighing in favor of finding excusable neglect, see id. (citing Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick\n\nAssocs. Ltd. P’ship, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112835\"><a href=\"/opinion/112835/pioneer-investment-services-co-v-brunswick-associates-ltd-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (1993)). Evans has not explained how the district court\n\nabused its discretion in granting Defendants’ motion for leave to file out of time. His contention that\n\nsummary judgment should be denied based on Defendants’ failure to comply with the briefing\n\nschedule thus fails.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE district court’s grant of summary judgment as to\n\nEvans’s First Amendment retaliation and Fourth Amendment unreasonable-search claims against\n\nDefendants in their individual capacities—and their official capacities to the extent injunctive relief\n\nis sought— AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in all other respects, and REMAND the case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f</pre>",
