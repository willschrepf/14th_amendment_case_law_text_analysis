In the fallout from that event, news rapidly circulated about numerous\n\nprivate conversations between the two men over the preceding months. The exchanges left the\n\nformer Director feeling unnerved and, apparently, wanting a paper trail. On June 8, Comey\n\ntestified publicly that while still in office, he had created several contemporaneous memoranda\n\ndocumenting up to nine conversations with the President. The content of those memos has since\n\nbeen the subject of intense public speculation and is the focus of these consolidated cases.\n\n       Plaintiffs, which include various news organizations and non-profits, all sought copies of\n\nthe so-called Comey Memos via a tried-and-true method: The Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552 et seq. The Government denied each request, claiming that the release of these\n\ndocuments would interfere with the Office of Special Counsel’s ongoing investigation into links\n\nbetween Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign team. Plaintiffs then brought these suits, and both\n\nsides now seek summary judgment. After reviewing the Memos in camera, as well as receiving\n\n                                                 1\n\fa sealed ex parte proffer from the Special Counsel’s Office, the Court agrees with the\n\nGovernment’s assessment. As it prevails here, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain\n\nin the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Drawing from public reports, the Court begins by recounting the now-familiar story of\n\nComey’s termination, as well as his much-discussed Memos. (The appointment of and\n\ninvestigation by the Special Counsel will be covered in Part III, infra.) It then outlines the\n\nprocedural history of this case.\n\n       A.       Factual Background\n\n       On March 20, 2017, then-Director Comey confirmed in public testimony “that the FBI, as\n\npart of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to\n\ninterfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links\n\nbetween individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russia’s efforts.” Statement\n\nBefore the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, available at https://www.fbi.gov/\n\nnews/testimony/hpsci-hearing-titled-russian-active-measures-investigation. He added, “As with\n\nany counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes\n\nwere committed.” Id. Two months later, the President fired Comey, citing, among other\n\nreasons, frustration with the ongoing probe into Russian interference, which he saw as “an\n\nexcuse by the Democrats for having lost [the] election.” CNN Statement of Undisputed Material\n\nFacts, ¶ 29.\n\n       On May 16, 2017 — one week after Comey left office — news of his Memos first broke.\n\nThe New York Times published a report about an Oval Office meeting between President Trump\n\nand the then-Director, said to have taken place on February 14 of that year. During this one-on-\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fone conversation, the President allegedly referenced a potential investigation into his former\n\nNational Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russia, telling Comey, “I hope you can\n\nsee your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Michael S. Schmidt, Comey Memo\n\nSays Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation, N.Y. Times (May 16, 2017), available at\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-\n\ninvestigation.html. The Times report was based on “a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the\n\nmeeting.” Id. According to the newspaper, “Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with\n\nsenior F.B.I. officials and close associates,” one of whom “read parts of [the Memo] to a Times\n\nreporter.” Id.\n\n       Spurred by this report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a hearing,\n\nduring which Comey corroborated the Times account. On June 8, he testified under oath for\n\nnearly three hours, fielding myriad questions about his Memos. See Hearing with Former FBI\n\nDirector James Comey, 115th Cong. (June 8, 2017) (Statement of James B. Comey), available at\n\nhttps://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf. He\n\nthere explained that after his first conversation with then-President-Elect Trump, he “felt\n\ncompelled to document” their encounter in a memo, which he “began to type . . . on a laptop in\n\nan FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment [he] walked out of the meeting.” Id. at 2.\n\n       According to Comey, “Creating written records immediately after one-on-one\n\nconversations with Mr. Trump was [his] practice from that point forward.” Id. He thought he\n\nhad done so “after each of [his] nine conversations” with the President, or at least “for nearly all\n\nof them, especially the ones that were substantive.” Transcript of Comey Hearing, available at\n\nhttps://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-former-fbi-director-james-comey#.\n\nComey said he had memorialized these conversations out of concern that President Trump\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f“might lie about the nature of our meeting.” Id. In such a scenario, he wanted a\n\ncontemporaneous account “to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the\n\nindependence of our investigative function.” Id.\n\n       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       The same day that news spread of Comey’s memoranda, Plaintiff Cable News Network\n\nsubmitted a FOIA request for copies of “all records of notes taken by or communications sent\n\nfrom FBI Director James Comey regarding or documenting interactions (including interviews\n\nand other conversations) with President Donald Trump.” Def. MSJ (First Declaration of David\n\nM. Hardy), ¶ 6; see also id., Exh. CNN-B (CNN FOIA Request). CNN was not the only one\n\ninterested in the Comey Memos. Plaintiffs Daily Caller News Foundation, non-profit\n\norganizations Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, and USA Today (the business name of\n\nGannett Satellite Information Network), along with its reporter Brad Heath, the James Madison\n\nProject, and journalists Garrett Graff and Lachlan Markay, all submitted FOIA requests to the\n\nsame end. See First Hardy Decl., ¶¶ 14, 21, 30, 37, 44. Some Plaintiffs (including the USA\n\nToday group and Freedom Watch) sought additional related records, which are outside the scope\n\nof the instant summary-judgment motions. See, e.g., id., ¶ 44.\n\n       The Department of Justice responded to each request by letter dated June 16, 2017,\n\ninvoking Exemption 7(A) to withhold all documents. To wit, it stated: “The records responsive\n\nto your request are law enforcement records. There is a pending or prospective law enforcement\n\nproceeding relevant to these responsive records, and the release of the information could\n\nreasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Id., Exhs. CNN-F, USA\n\nToday-D, JMP/Graff-D, JMP/Markay-C, JW-D, FW-D. Undeterred, all Plaintiffs timely brought\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\factions in this Court, suing, variously, the FBI and DOJ. The Court consolidated their cases on\n\nJuly 31, 2017. See Minute Order.\n\n       Four months later, the Government moved for partial summary judgment as to all\n\nrequests related to the Comey Memos, and Plaintiffs, in turn, filed cross-motions for the same.\n\nTo bolster its case, the Department of Justice also sought leave to introduce an ex parte and in\n\ncamera affidavit from David W. Archey, a Deputy Assistant Director with the\n\nCounterintelligence Division, who currently supervises all FBI personnel assigned to the\n\ninvestigation into Russia’s interference with the 2016 Presidential election. See ECF No. 23.\n\nAfter the parties finished briefing, the Court granted the Government’s request and ordered, at\n\nPlaintiffs’ behest, that it also produce all withheld Memos for in camera review. See Minute\n\nOrder of Jan. 11, 2018.\n\n       The Court reviewed those submissions and, out of an abundance of caution, thought it\n\nhelpful to seek more specifics as to the Memos’ connection with an ongoing investigation. It\n\ntherefore asked that an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel proffer such information.\n\nMichael R. Dreeben, who serves as Counsel to the Special Counsel, did so in a sealed, on-the-\n\nrecord ex parte session. Finally, in response to this Court’s follow-up questions about that sealed\n\nproffer, the Government submitted the Third Declaration of David W. Archey in camera and ex\n\nparte. See ECF No. 47. (The agency previously moved to submit the Second Declaration of\n\nDavid W. Archey regarding records other than the Memos, see ECF No. 46, and the Court has\n\nnot yet ruled on that motion.) Although none of this material is currently available to Plaintiffs,\n\nall forms part of the record that could be reviewed on appeal or in any subsequent litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986); Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A fact is “material” if it is capable of affecting the\n\nsubstantive outcome of the litigation. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248; Holcomb, 433 F.3d at\n\n895. A dispute is “genuine” if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\n\nfor the non-moving party. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Liberty Lobby, 477\n\nU.S. at 248; Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 895. “A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely\n\ndisputed must support the assertion” by “citing to particular parts of materials in the record” or\n\n“showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute,\n\nor that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c)(1). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).\n\n       FOIA cases typically are decided on motions for summary judgment. See Brayton v.\n\nOffice of U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011). In a FOIA case, the Court may\n\naccept an “agency’s affidavits, without pre-summary judgment discovery, if the affidavits are\n\nmade in good faith and provide reasonably specific detail concerning the methods used to\n\nproduce the information sought.” Broaddrick v. Exec. Office of the President, 139 F. Supp. 2d\n\n55, 64 (D.D.C. 2001). “Agency affidavits are accorded a presumption of good faith, which\n\ncannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other\n\ndocuments.” SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). “Summary judgment may not be appropriate without in\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcamera review,” however, “when agency affidavits in support of a claim of exemption are\n\ninsufficiently detailed.” Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the President, 97 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996). In such a circumstance, “district court judges [have] broad discretion in determining\n\nwhether in camera review is appropriate.” Id. at 577–78.\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       The country (or at least the Beltway) has spent months abuzz about the Comey Memos\n\nand what they might reveal. Despite rampant media speculation, however, the Memos\n\nthemselves have remained out of public view. The Government hopes to keep it that way, but to\n\nwithhold release under FOIA, it must satisfy two elements. First, it must “demonstrate the . . .\n\nadequacy of the search” for relevant documents. Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1982). Second, it must show that the withheld material “falls within one of nine statutory\n\nexemptions.” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, 745 F.3d\n\n535, 540 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs attack the Government’s efforts at each step.\n\n       A.      Adequacy of Search\n\n       “An agency fulfills its obligations under FOIA if it can demonstrate beyond material\n\ndoubt that its search was ‘reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.’” Valencia-\n\nLucena v. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 325 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897\n\nF.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); see also Steinberg v. DOJ, 23 F.3d 548, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\nThe adequacy of an agency’s search for documents under FOIA “is judged by a standard of\n\nreasonableness and depends, not surprisingly, upon the facts of each case.” Weisberg v. DOJ,\n\n745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\n        Here, the FBI’s Records Management Division, which was “involved in compiling and\n\npreserving” the former Director’s records, first located the memoranda. See First Hardy Decl.,\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f¶ 62. It passed them along to the National Security and Cyber Law Branch of the FBI’s Office of\n\nthe General Counsel, which is responsible for providing legal advice “regarding the Russian\n\ninterference investigation,” Second Declaration of David M. Hardy, ¶ 4, and thus was “already\n\nfamiliar” with the relevant records. See First Hardy Decl., ¶ 62. That group then confirmed that\n\nthe located materials “were, in fact, the full set of memos.” Id. Just to play it safe, the\n\nGovernment has also double checked with the Special Counsel’s Office, which has since\n\ncompiled the Memos. They, too, concluded that the FBI had located all of Comey’s records.\n\nSee Second Hardy Decl., ¶ 4. In sum, “[t]he FBI is confident that it has identified and located\n\nthe entire collection of documents comprising the ‘Comey Memos.’” Id.\n\n       Two Plaintiffs, nevertheless, remain unconvinced. Daily Caller and USA Today argue\n\nthat the agency has not adequately explained its search efforts, variously noting that “the FBI did\n\nnot conduct its search using the standard method of searching its Central Records System,” USA\n\nToday Br. at 5, and that the agency must “identify the number of records they located.” DCNF\n\nBr. at 6. Neither argument holds water.\n\n       While querying an electronic database may be appropriate in the mine-run FOIA foray,\n\nthe requests here center on a “discrete set of extraordinarily high-profile” and easily identifiable\n\nrecords — namely, any memoranda that then-Director Comey wrote documenting his\n\nconversations with President Trump. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Defense, 857 F. Supp.\n\n2d 44, 54 (D.D.C. 2012) (holding DOD’s search for post-mortem photographs of Osama Bin\n\nLaden sufficient, as “the relevant individuals [would be] well aware” whether such records\n\nexisted). Allowing officials with “relevant knowledge of these documents” to search for them,\n\nsee First Hardy Decl., ¶ 62, is thus “reasonable[e]” given the “facts of [this] case.” Weisberg,\n\n745 F.2d at 1485. The Government avers that it has located all Memos, and Plaintiffs’ “[m]ere\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fspeculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the\n\nagency conducted a reasonable search for them.” SafeCard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1201.\n\n       Nor must the Department reveal the exact number of documents located, as it asserts that\n\ndoing so “could reveal sensitive nonpublic information and compromise the investigation.” Def.\n\nReply at 8–9. “[W]here, as here, an agency indicates that no additional information concerning\n\nan investigation may be publicly disclosed without revealing precisely the information that the\n\nagency seeks to withhold,” the Court can properly resolve the issue by in camera review. See\n\nBarnard v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec’y, 598 F. Supp. 2d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2009). Indeed, Daily Caller\n\nalternatively asks this “Court [to] review the Comey Memos in camera to determine whether all\n\nresponsive records have been located.” DCNF Reply at 3 n.3. The Court, having accepted that\n\ninvitation, sees no reason to doubt the Government’s search effort.\n\n       B.      Valid Exemption\n\n       Although the Government invokes a slew of exemptions — including 1, 3, 6, 7(C) and\n\n7(E) — to justify withholding the Memos, it primarily leans on Exemption 7(A). Because the\n\nCourt deems this last one applicable, it “need not address the other exemptions invoked by the\n\ngovernment and reserve[s] judgment on whether they too would support withholding” the\n\nComey Memos. See Ctr. for Nat’l Security. Studies v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 331 F.3d 918, 925\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n       “[J]udicial review of an asserted Exemption 7 privilege requires a two-part inquiry.”\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 622 (1982). As a threshold matter,\n\nthe Court must determine whether the withheld “records or information” were “compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). If the agency so establishes, it must then\n\ndemonstrate that a particular subpart of Exemption 7 applies. Here, it must show that release of\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fthose records “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Id.\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(A). The Court discusses each requirement in turn.\n\n               1. Exemption 7 Threshold\n\n       The Government offers two explanations as to why the Comey Memos satisfy Exemption\n\n7’s threshold requirement. First, it says that they contain information that was originally\n\ncompiled as part of the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference. See Def. Reply at 10.\n\nSecond, it indicates that the Memos themselves have since been compiled for law-enforcement\n\npurposes. Id. at 2, 10. The Court focuses on this latter theory, as it alone would place “all\n\nportions” of the Memos within Exemption 7’s purview. Id. at 10.\n\n       DOJ’s public briefing (however vague) suggests that the Comey Memos “have been\n\ncompiled into[] the ongoing investigation by the Special Counsel into Russian interference in the\n\n2016 election.” Id. at 2. By way of background, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\n\nappointed Robert S. Mueller as Special Counsel on May 17, 2017. The Office of Special\n\nCounsel has revealed little about the scope of its investigation, but Rosenstein’s initial order\n\nauthorized Mueller to investigate “(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian\n\ngovernment and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and (ii)\n\nany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and (iii) any other matters\n\nwith the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).” DOJ Order No. 3915–2017 (May 17, 2017). Under that\n\nsection, the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction includes “the authority to investigate and prosecute\n\nfederal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special\n\nCounsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and\n\nintimidation of witnesses.” Although the Government has been tight-lipped in its briefing about\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fexactly why the Special Counsel compiled these Memos, the First Archey Declaration confirms\n\nthat the Office did so for law-enforcement purposes — i.e., in service of that investigation.\n\n       Without reviewing the Archey Declaration, Plaintiffs, of course, are somewhat hamstrung\n\nin their ability to dispute this position. Instead, they focus their fire on Comey’s intent when he\n\nfirst created the Memos. CNN, Judicial Watch, and Daily Caller argue that the Director, by his\n\nown admission, penned these Memos not “in furtherance of an investigation but for ‘political’\n\npurposes,” to “preserv[e] the FBI’s integrity as an institution.” CNN Br. at 15–17; see also JW\n\nBr. at 11; DCNF Br. at 9–10. That may be so, but it matters not if the Memos “were generated\n\non an earlier occasion and for a different purpose.” John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493\n\nU.S. 146, 154 (1989). Rather, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “objects sought merely\n\nmust have been ‘compiled’ when the Government invokes the Exemption.” Id. at 153. In other\n\nwords, Exemption 7 applies to “materials originally collected for a benign purpose” so long as\n\nthey were “eventually . . . compiled or incorporated into a law-enforcement investigatory file.”\n\nGould Inc. v. General Servs. Admin., 688 F. Supp. 689, 697 (D.D.C. 1988). Comey’s intent —\n\nwhatever it was — is therefore irrelevant for Exemption 7 purposes.\n\n       The Government thus need show only that it has since “compiled” the Memos for law-\n\nenforcement purposes, a bar it easily clears. The Supreme Court “has given a fairly broad\n\nmeaning to ‘compiled’ under § 552(b)(7),” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 584–85\n\n(2011) (Alito, J., concurring), holding that “[a] compilation, in its ordinary meaning, is\n\nsomething composed of materials collected and assembled from various sources or other\n\ndocuments.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 153. The D.C. Circuit, too, has explained that “the\n\nterm ‘compiled’ in Exemption 7 requires that a document be created, gathered, or used by an\n\nagency for law enforcement purposes at some time before the agency invokes the exemption.”\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fPub. Employees for Environmental Responsibility v. U.S. Sec., Int’l Boundary and Water\n\nComm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 203 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (emphasis added). Here, the Special\n\nCounsel has “gathered” or “used” each of the Comey Memos for his investigation. That suffices\n\nto satisfy Section 7’s threshold requirement. See W. Journalism Ctr. v. Office of Indep’t\n\nCounsel, 926 F. Supp. 189, 191–92 (D.D.C. 1996) (“The materials obtained from the designated\n\ninvestigative agencies have been made part of the Independent Counsel’s overall continuing\n\ninvestigation and by definition have been compiled for law enforcement purposes.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs try to chip away at this conclusion, but none of their counterarguments proves\n\npersuasive. First up, CNN correctly points out that in order to rely on 7(A), the agency must\n\nhave compiled the documents before it invoked that exemption on June 16, 2017. See Pub.\n\nEmployees, 740 F.3d at 203. In his public testimony on June 8, Comey averred, on two separate\n\noccasions, that he had already turned over his copies of the Memos to the Special Counsel team.\n\nSee Transcript of Comey Hearing. It stands to reason, then, that the Special Counsel had\n\ncompiled them by at least that date. The Government has also submitted another ex parte\n\nArchey Declaration clarifying that the Special Counsel had indeed assembled the Comey Memos\n\nbefore June 16. See Third Archey Decl., ¶ 4.\n\n        Next, Daily Caller highlights that “the FBI searched for and located records in archived,\n\nadministrative files,” rather than “in the Special Counsel’s files.” DCNF Br. at 10. This is true,\n\nbut irrelevant. As explained earlier, the exemption applies to “documents already collected by\n\nthe Government originally for non-law-enforcement purposes.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at\n\n153. Naturally enough, copies of those documents might remain in their original, innocuous file.\n\nBut a “plaintiff may not circumvent the effect of Exemption 7 by seeking information in the\n\ninvestigatory file from other unprotected government sources.” Gould, 688 F. Supp. at 698 n.23.\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNor does the agency lose Exemption 7 protection simply because it happened to search for the\n\ndocuments there, rather than in the Special Counsel’s files. The fact that “other copies exist in\n\ngovernment files does not strip these documents — and the information they contain — of their\n\nexemption from disclosure.” Id.; see also John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 153 (approvingly citing\n\nGould).\n\n               2. Exemption 7(A)\n\n       The Court turns now to whether releasing the Memos “could reasonably be expected to\n\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). In enacting this exemption,\n\n“Congress recognized that law enforcement agencies had legitimate needs to keep certain records\n\nconfidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations.” NLRB v. Robbins Tire &\n\nRubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 224 (1978). To that end, “Exemption 7(A) does not require a\n\npresently pending ‘enforcement proceeding.’” Ctr. for Nat’l Security, 331 F.3d at 926. Instead,\n\n“an ongoing criminal investigation typically triggers Exemption 7(A).” CREW v. DOJ, 746 F.3d\n\n1082, 1098 (D.C. Cir. 2014). “[S]o long as the investigation continues to gather evidence for a\n\npossible future criminal case, and that case would be jeopardized by the premature release of that\n\nevidence, Exemption 7(A) applies.” Juarez v. Dep’t of Justice, 518 F.3d 54, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2008);\n\nsee also Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“The\n\nenforcement proceedings need not be currently ongoing; it suffices for them to be reasonably\n\nanticipated.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In evaluating the Department’s Exemption 7(A) defense, this Court must “give deference\n\nto an agency’s predictive judgment of the harm that will result from disclosure of information.”\n\nCREW, 746 F.3d at 1098. It cannot, however, act as a rubber stamp simply because the agency\n\n“assert[s] that disclosure will interfere with enforcement proceedings; it must rather demonstrate\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fhow disclosure will do so.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court concluded that\n\nDOJ’s initial submissions fell short in that respect, as they lacked “specific information about the\n\nimpact of the disclosures” or the “individual or entity that is the subject of the ongoing\n\ninvestigation.” Id. at 129–30. Even after an in camera review of the First Archey Declaration\n\nand the Memos themselves, the Court asked an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel to\n\nmake an on-the-record proffer about the investigation. Having heard this, the Court is now fully\n\nconvinced that disclosure “could reasonably be expected to interfere” with that ongoing\n\ninvestigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).\n\n       In disputing that conclusion, Plaintiffs make much of the fact that Comey himself\n\ntestified about the contents of at least some Memos. In light of those public statements, they\n\nwonder how much damage release could inflict now. While Comey may have testified about\n\nsome material in his Memos, he has never disseminated copies publicly. As the D.C. Circuit has\n\nheld, “[T]he fact that information exists in some form in the public domain does not necessarily\n\nmean that official disclosure will not cause harm cognizable under a FOIA exemption.” Wolf v.\n\nCIA, 473 F.3d 370, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n       Until the Memos themselves enter the public domain, much remains uncertain about their\n\ncontents, including “the level of detail in the memos, the extent to which they corroborate Mr.\n\nComey’s testimony, and the extent to which they contain information that was not the subject of\n\nhis testimony.” Def. Reply at 15–16. Those “lingering doubts” about the accuracy or\n\nthoroughness of Comey’s testimony suffice to satisfy Exemption 7(A). Military Audit Project v.\n\nCasey, 656 F.2d 724, 745 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting benefits of leaving foreign intelligence\n\nservices with “lingering doubts” regarding accuracy of reported information); see also Afshar v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1130–31 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (distinguishing between\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f“[u]nofficial leaks and public surmise” and “official acknowledgment”); Wilson v. CIA, 586\n\nF.3d 171, 195 (2d Cir. 2009) (“[A]nything short of [an official] disclosure necessarily preserves\n\nsome increment of doubt regarding the reliability of the publicly available information.”).\n\n       That is not to say, as Daily Caller suggests, that DOJ (or this Court) has adopted the\n\nposition that “Director Comey lied under oath[.]” DCNF Reply Br. at 5. On the contrary, the\n\nDepartment has been mum on the accuracy of his testimony. The important point is that until the\n\nMemos are released, the public (or potential witnesses) cannot know how accurate his recall of\n\nthe Memos’ contents was. And perhaps more to the point, they cannot gauge “the level of detail\n\nin the memos” and “the extent to which they contain information that was not the subject of his\n\ntestimony.” Gov’t Reply at 15–16.\n\n       C.      Public Disclosure\n\n       As a variant of their prior-disclosure argument, Plaintiffs argue that Justice has waived\n\nany FOIA exemption pursuant to the public-domain doctrine. Under that doctrine, “materials\n\nnormally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose their protective cloak once disclosed and\n\npreserved in a permanent public record.” Cottone v. Reno, 193 F.3d 550, 554 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\nPlaintiffs argue such is the case here, principally because Comey testified publicly as to the\n\ncontents of the documents and also provided a copy of at least one Memo to his personal friend,\n\nColumbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman. These actions, they say, forfeited any\n\n“otherwise valid exemption claim,” at least as to those Memos (or portions thereof) publicly\n\ndiscussed. See Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990)). Separately examining each contention, the Court disagrees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f               1. Public Testimony\n\n       This Circuit employs a three-part test to determine whether the public-domain doctrine\n\napplies: (1) the “information requested must be as specific as the information previously\n\nreleased”; (2) “the information requested must match the information previously disclosed”; and\n\n(3) “the information requested must already have been made public through an official and\n\ndocumented disclosure.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 620–21\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ reliance on Comey’s congressional testimony flunks all three prongs. As\n\ndiscussed above, his paraphrased statements do not necessarily “match” any portion of his\n\nMemos, nor are they necessarily as “specific” as the original. Id. The D.C. Circuit has\n\n“insist[ed] on exactitude” as to these requirements, and “[p]rior disclosure of similar information\n\ndoes not suffice; instead, the specific information sought by the plaintiff must already be in the\n\npublic domain by official disclosure.” Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (emphasis omitted). In this case,\n\nthe Director’s oral account of the Memos is no substitute for the written hard copy. See, e.g., id.\n\n(holding that although former CIA Director had officially acknowledged “existence” of records\n\nby reading from them during congressional testimony, agency could still establish that\n\n“contents” of those records were exempt).\n\n       In any event, Comey no longer served as FBI Director when he testified and therefore\n\nlacked any authority to make official releases on that agency’s behalf. To be “official,” the\n\nrelease must have been by “the agency from which the information is being sought.” Frugone v.\n\nCIA, 169 F.3d 772, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Statements made by former government officials,\n\neven high-level ones, do not constitute official acknowledgment. See Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1133\n\n(holding that “a number of books by former CIA agents and officials, all of which were\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fsubmitted to the agency for prepublication review” still fell short of “an official and documented\n\ndisclosure, as the release of CIA cables would be”); see also Hudson River Sloop Clearwater,\n\nInc. v. Dep’t of Navy, 891 F.2d 414, 421 (2d Cir. 1989) (“Admiral Carroll’s statements cannot\n\neffect an official disclosure of information since he is no longer an active naval officer.”);\n\nSimmons v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 796 F.2d 709, 712 (4th Cir. 1986) (holding FOIA exemption\n\nnot overcome, even where former FBI agent released documents in question because “release\n\nfrom an official source naturally confirms the accuracy of the previously leaked information”).\n\n               2. Disclosure to Professor Richman\n\n       In his congressional testimony, Comey also admitted that he had shared a copy of at least\n\nhis February 14 Memo with a “good friend” who is “a professor at Columbia law school.”\n\nTranscript of Comey Hearing. The Plaintiffs presume this friend to be Professor Daniel\n\nRichman, see, e.g., CNN SOMF, ¶ 34; JW SOMF, ¶ 48, and the Government does not directly\n\ndispute that assertion. See Gov’t Response to CNN’s SOMF, ¶ 34; Response to JW’S SOMF,\n\n¶¶ 35-48. The Court therefore adopts the same assumption and considers whether the February\n\n14 Memo (or any others disclosed to Richman) must be released.\n\n       The parties debate exactly when Comey made that disclosure, as the Government says it\n\nis “unaware” whether “Director Comey, during his tenure as Director, publicly shared the\n\nmemos, their contents, or details about the conversations they document.” Second Hardy Decl.,\n\n¶ 6. But even if it occurred before his termination, Comey apparently never intended to do so in\n\nhis official capacity; rather, at the time, he considered the Memos his “own personal”\n\nrecollections, which he “felt free to share” “[a]s a private citizen.” Transcript of Comey Hearing.\n\nConsequently, the Department reports that it “has not located any documented official disclosure\n\nof the memos or their contents.” Second Hardy Decl., ¶ 6. Against that backdrop, the Director’s\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fentrustment of his then-personal Memos to a friend falls short of an “official and documented\n\ndisclosure.” ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21 (“[T]he information requested must already have been\n\nmade public through an official and documented disclosure.”). That alone could defeat\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims.\n\n        At any rate, Comey’s limited disclosure to one friend, even if made in his official\n\ncapacity, is insufficient to waive Exemption 7(A) protection. The D.C. Circuit has counseled\n\nthat “while the logic of FOIA postulates that an exemption can serve no purpose once\n\ninformation . . . becomes public, we must be confident that the information sought is truly public\n\nand that the requester receive no more than what is publicly available before we find a waiver.”\n\nCottone, 193 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation and citation omitted). For the public-domain\n\ndoctrine to apply, the specific information sought must have already been “disclosed and\n\npreserved in a permanent public record.” Id. at 554; see also Davis v. Dep’t of Justice, 968 F.2d\n\n1276, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n        In this case, the withheld documents are far from “truly public.” On the contrary, they\n\nexist — at most — in one law professor’s possession. Professor Richman’s home or office\n\nhardly qualifies as the “public domain.” The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Students Against\n\nGenocide v. Department of State, 257 F.3d 828 (D.C. Cir. 2001), is instructive on this point.\n\nThere, the Court of Appeals considered classified “spy satellite” and “spy plane” photographs\n\nthat then-U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright had shown to foreign delegates of the United\n\nNations Security Council. Id. at 830. The plaintiff organizations argued that Ambassador\n\nAlbright had waived the pertinent FOIA exemptions by such display. Id. at 836. The Circuit\n\nrejected that position, explaining that the photographs “plainly [did] not fall within the [public-\n\ndomain] doctrine. They were not released to the general public; only the Security Council\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdelegates saw them.” Id.; see also Muslim Advocates v. Dep’t of Justice, 833 F. Supp. 2d 92,\n\n101–02 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding public-domain doctrine did not apply to FBI’s Domestic\n\nInvestigations and Operations Guide, even though agency had allowed several civil-rights groups\n\nto view and take notes on disputed chapters).\n\n       True, Professor Richman (at least at one point) may have possessed some subset of the\n\nMemos, whereas the delegates in Students Against Genocide only saw the withheld photographs.\n\nThat difference, however, is of no moment. As an initial matter, Richman has publicly reported\n\nreturning all documents to the FBI. See Matt Zapotosky, Comey Friend Says He Is ‘Turning\n\nOver Relevant’ Documents to FBI, Wash. Post (June 13, 2017),\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/ live-updates/trump-white-house/sessions-to-\n\ntestify-before-senate-intelligence-committee/comey-friend-says-he-is-turning-over-relevant-\n\ndocuments-to-fbi/?utm_term=.78194270be35. If that is so, it is clear that no “permanent public\n\nrecord[s]” remain of the Memos. See Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554.\n\n       Even if Richman retained copies, that would not vitiate the agency’s exemption. In\n\narguing otherwise, Plaintiffs latch onto language in Students Against Genocide stating that “a\n\ndisclosure made to any FOIA requester is effectively a disclosure to the world at large.” 257\n\nF.3d at 826 (emphasis added). They argue by analogy that a disclosure made to any person has\n\nthe same effect, but that is a bridge too far. Comey’s discretionary release of documents to a\n\nclose friend is hardly analogous to the agency’s release of information due to statutory\n\nobligation. In the latter scenario, it is reasonable to assume that the requester will publicize the\n\nmaterial, and neither the agency nor court has any basis to “limit that dissemination.” Id. Here,\n\nby contrast, Comey apparently made a judgment call that he could entrust at least one Memo to\n\nRichman without their broader release. His choice to do so did not automatically catapult those\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fdocuments into the public domain, and the Court will not assume Richman will release them\n\nmore widely absent evidence to the contrary.\n\n       In fact, at this point — almost nine months since Comey could have shared any Memo in\n\nhis official capacity — Richman has still not released anything. Although he, apparently at\n\nComey’s behest, described the contents of the February 14 Memo to the New York Times, the\n\nnewspaper made clear that it had “not viewed a copy of the memo”; instead, Richman “read parts\n\nof it to a Times reporter.” Schmidt, Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn\n\nInvestigation, N.Y. Times (May 16, 2017). To the extent Richman still holds copies, he has kept\n\nthem close to his vest. Were it otherwise, Plaintiffs would have little need to seek the Memos by\n\nway of FOIA.\n\n       In like circumstances, “courts generally find no waiver under § 552(b)(7)(A) even though\n\nthere has been a limited, discretionary disclosure.” Anderson v. Dep’t of Treasury, No. 98-1112,\n\n1999 WL 282784, at *4 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 24, 1999); see also Erb v. Dep’t of Justice, 572 F.\n\nSupp. 954, 956 (W.D. Mich. 1983) (holding that there had been no waiver of Exemption 7(A)\n\neven where prosecutor had disclosed FBI report to counsel for target of investigation). Similarly,\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has noted that with respect to classified information, “a limited disclosure to a\n\nsmall number of individuals might not be enough to render classification inappropriate.”\n\nAncient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 510 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n       The Court acknowledges that this situation is rather unprecedented; it is not every day\n\nthat an FBI Director feels the need to memorialize his conversations with a sitting President and\n\nthen publicize that he did so. But the caselaw aligns with common sense. The public-domain\n\ndoctrine exists because release of a “truly public” document can do little harm to the agency’s\n\ninterests; in that case, the exemption “can serve no purpose.” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555. Here, by\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fcontrast, the Memos are possibly held by one person outside the agency, and the Bureau and\n\nSpecial Counsel still have something to lose by their dissemination to the broader public. The\n\nCourt therefore holds that Comey’s release of any documents to his close friend does not waive\n\nthe agency’s otherwise valid Exemption 7(A) defense.\n\n               3. Other Arguments\n\n       Plaintiffs also raise an array of other arguments for waiver, but the Court can dispose of\n\neach in short order. First, USA Today contends that this Court has discretion to treat “President\n\nTrump’s public denial of the substantive accuracy of Director Comey’s claims [as] incorporating\n\nby reference the substance of what Director Comey said occurred.” USA Today Br. at 12.\n\nPlaintiff’s logic is a bit hard to parse, and it admits to lacking any “case law on-point” for its\n\nposition, but the upshot seems to be that the President’s denials somehow constitute an “official\n\ndisclosure” of any referenced Memo’s contents. Id. at 11. This theory suffers at least two flaws.\n\nFirst, Trump repudiated Comey’s testimony; he never discussed nor purported to know the\n\ncontents of the Memos themselves. He therefore could not have “incorporated” that information\n\nby reference into any official disclosure. Second, the President’s denials hardly recited any\n\nportion of the Memos verbatim and thus are not as “specific” as the records sought nor an exact\n\n“match” for their content. See ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21.\n\n       Daily Caller and Judicial Watch next argue that the FBI “officially acknowledged”\n\nComey’s testimony when it failed to “dispute, disavow, [or] even disagree” with it. See DCNF\n\nBr. at 13; see also JW Br. at 15. Far from “an official and documented disclosure,” however, the\n\nagency’s silence is just that — silence. See ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21. It had no duty to\n\nrespond to an ex-employee’s testimony, and it has, by design, disclosed nothing about whether\n\nComey’s statements were an accurate synopsis of the Memos or as detailed as the originals.\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f       Finally, Judicial Watch maintains that the agency itself revealed the “potential connection\n\nbetween the memo [concerning the Flynn discussion] and Special Counsel Mueller’s\n\ninvestigation.” JW Reply at 3. It suggests that voluntarily disclosing this connection somehow\n\n“undermines” the agency’s entire Exemption 7(A) defense, such that it must now disclose the\n\nMemo in toto. Id. Plaintiff invokes Labow v. Department of Justice, 831 F.3d 523 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2016), but such reliance is quite a stretch. In Labow, the Government resisted the release of\n\ndocuments under Exemption 3, which protects, inter alia, materials related to a grand jury’s\n\nidentity, investigation, or deliberation. Id. at 529–30. The agency contended that although the\n\ndocuments were not damning when standing alone, a grand jury had subpoenaed them, such that\n\nrelease would “reveal the direction” of its investigation. Id. at 529. The Court of Appeals\n\nrejected that argument, noting that the Government had blown its own cover by linking the\n\ndocuments to the grand jury in the first place. Id. at 529–30.\n\n       By contrast, DOJ does not argue here that release of the documents is harmful merely\n\nbecause they are in the Special Counsel’s folder. Instead, Justice seeks to protect the contents of\n\nthe Memos, as release would reveal “the level of detail in the memos, the extent to which they\n\ncorroborate Mr. Comey’s testimony, and the extent to which they contain information that was\n\nnot the subject of his testimony.” Def. Reply 15–16. None of that information is public, and\n\nExemption 7(A) thus applies with full force.\n\n       D.      Segregability\n\n       Even if this Court stops short of releasing some or all Memos in full, Plaintiffs\n\nalternatively ask that it require the Department to turn over any non-exempt portions of those\n\nrecords. See, e.g., CNN Br. at 28-29. FOIA requires that an agency produce “[a]ny reasonably\n\nsegregable portion” of a record “after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f§ 552(b). In making a determination as to segregability or any other question under FOIA, a\n\ndistrict court judge “may examine the contents of . . . agency records in camera.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B); see also Armstrong, 97 F.3d at 578–79. That analysis, however, “does not call\n\nfor parsing the [Comey Memos] ‘line-by-line’ or segregating material ‘dispersed throughout the\n\ndocument,’” as Plaintiffs suggest. See Nat’l Ass’n of Crim. Defense Lawyers v. DOJ Exec.\n\nOffice for U.S. Attorneys, 844 F.3d 246, 257 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Mead Data Ctr. Inc. v.\n\nDep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). “Instead, the emphasis is on\n\nsegregation of non-exempt material found in ‘logically divisible sections.’” Id. (quoting Mead\n\nData, 566 at 261 n.54).\n\n       Here, the Government asserts that no “logically divisible” section of the Memos is\n\nsegregable. Indeed, releasing any portion would necessarily reveal their “level of detail,” as well\n\nas the extent to which those records do — or do not — corroborate Comey’s testimony or\n\ninclude any information omitted from that public account. See Def. Reply 15–16. The Court has\n\nreviewed the disputed documents in camera and confirmed that no portion is reasonably\n\nsegregable.\n\n       It stresses, however, that Exemption 7(A) is temporal in nature and not designed to\n\n“endlessly protect material simply because it [is] in an investigatory file.” Robbins Tire &\n\nRubber, 437 U.S. at 230. The Special Counsel’s investigation will not last forever, and “once the\n\nrelevant enforcement proceedings are over, the exemption no longer applies.” Stein v. SEC, 266\n\nF. Supp. 3d 326, 343–344 (D.D.C. 2017). When the investigation in this case is “either\n\nconcluded or abandoned,” Plaintiffs “may seek release of the records under the FOIA at that\n\ntime,” subject to any other exemptions that may apply. Barney v. IRS, 618 F.2d 1268, 1273–74\n\n(8th Cir. 1980); see also Maydak v. Dep’t of Justice, 218 F.3d 760 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (noting that\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fGovernment may rely on other exemptions, so long as they were previously “genuinely\n\nassert[ed],” once Exemption 7(A) is no longer available).\n\n        E.      Rule 56(d) Discovery\n\n        Finally, Freedom Watch moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) to place the\n\nsummary-judgment proceedings on ice until it can conduct discovery. Under that Rule, a court\n\nmay defer considering a motion for summary judgment, deny the motion, or allow time for the\n\nnon-movant to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery if that party “shows by\n\naffidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its\n\nopposition.” Such an affidavit must state “with sufficient particularity why additional discovery\n\nis necessary.” United States ex rel. Folliard v. Gov’t Acquisitions, Inc., 764 F.3d 19, 26 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the non-movant’s\n\naffidavit must: (1) “outline the particular facts the non-movant intends to discover and describe\n\nwhy those facts are necessary to the litigation”; (2) “explain why the non-movant could not\n\nproduce the facts in opposition to the motion for summary judgment”; and (3) “show the\n\ninformation is in fact discoverable.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiff asks this Court to allow discovery or, alternatively, to “review all responsive\n\ndocumentation in camera and then inform the parties of its determination of which of the\n\ndocuments, if any, truly fall under any valid FOIA exemption.” FW Br. at 5. Now that the Court\n\nhas followed this latter course, it is not clear whether Freedom Watch’s request for discovery still\n\nstands. To the extent it does, the Court denies it. Plaintiff never makes clear exactly what it\n\nseeks in discovery, other than noting that the agency has “failed to even provide a Vaughn\n\nindex,” which would catalog the documents withheld. Id. at 4. But the agency has now provided\n\nthe Court with the actual Comey Memos, giving it all materials needed to evaluate Exemption\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f7(A). Plaintiff has thus failed to identify any other documents that might be “necessary to the\n\nlitigation.” Folliard, 764 F.3d at 26 (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and denies Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motions. It also denies Plaintiff Freedom Watch’s Motion\n\nfor Relief under Rule 56(d). A contemporaneous Order to that effect will issue this day.\n\n\n                                                     /s/ James E.

In the fallout from that event, news rapidly circulated about numerous\n\nprivate conversations between the two men over the preceding months. The exchanges left the\n\nformer Director feeling unnerved and, apparently, wanting a paper trail. On June 8, Comey\n\ntestified publicly that while still in office, he had created several contemporaneous memoranda\n\ndocumenting up to nine conversations with the President. The content of those memos has since\n\nbeen the subject of intense public speculation and is the focus of these consolidated cases.\n\n       Plaintiffs, which include various news organizations and non-profits, all sought copies of\n\nthe so-called Comey Memos via a tried-and-true method: The Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552 et seq. The Government denied each request, claiming that the release of these\n\ndocuments would interfere with the Office of Special Counsel’s ongoing investigation into links\n\nbetween Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign team. Plaintiffs then brought these suits, and both\n\nsides now seek summary judgment. After reviewing the Memos in camera, as well as receiving\n\n                                                 1\n\fa sealed ex parte proffer from the Special Counsel’s Office, the Court agrees with the\n\nGovernment’s assessment. As it prevails here, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain\n\nin the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Drawing from public reports, the Court begins by recounting the now-familiar story of\n\nComey’s termination, as well as his much-discussed Memos. (The appointment of and\n\ninvestigation by the Special Counsel will be covered in Part III, infra.) It then outlines the\n\nprocedural history of this case.\n\n       A.       Factual Background\n\n       On March 20, 2017, then-Director Comey confirmed in public testimony “that the FBI, as\n\npart of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to\n\ninterfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links\n\nbetween individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russia’s efforts.” Statement\n\nBefore the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, available at https://www.fbi.gov/\n\nnews/testimony/hpsci-hearing-titled-russian-active-measures-investigation. He added, “As with\n\nany counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes\n\nwere committed.” Id. Two months later, the President fired Comey, citing, among other\n\nreasons, frustration with the ongoing probe into Russian interference, which he saw as “an\n\nexcuse by the Democrats for having lost [the] election.” CNN Statement of Undisputed Material\n\nFacts, ¶ 29.\n\n       On May 16, 2017 — one week after Comey left office — news of his Memos first broke.\n\nThe New York Times published a report about an Oval Office meeting between President Trump\n\nand the then-Director, said to have taken place on February 14 of that year. During this one-on-\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fone conversation, the President allegedly referenced a potential investigation into his former\n\nNational Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russia, telling Comey, “I hope you can\n\nsee your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Michael S. Schmidt, Comey Memo\n\nSays Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation, N.Y. Times (May 16, 2017), available at\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-\n\ninvestigation.html. The Times report was based on “a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the\n\nmeeting.” Id. According to the newspaper, “Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with\n\nsenior F.B.I. officials and close associates,” one of whom “read parts of [the Memo] to a Times\n\nreporter.” Id.\n\n       Spurred by this report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a hearing,\n\nduring which Comey corroborated the Times account. On June 8, he testified under oath for\n\nnearly three hours, fielding myriad questions about his Memos. See Hearing with Former FBI\n\nDirector James Comey, 115th Cong. (June 8, 2017) (Statement of James B. Comey), available at\n\nhttps://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf. He\n\nthere explained that after his first conversation with then-President-Elect Trump, he “felt\n\ncompelled to document” their encounter in a memo, which he “began to type . . . on a laptop in\n\nan FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment [he] walked out of the meeting.” Id. at 2.\n\n       According to Comey, “Creating written records immediately after one-on-one\n\nconversations with Mr. Trump was [his] practice from that point forward.” Id. He thought he\n\nhad done so “after each of [his] nine conversations” with the President, or at least “for nearly all\n\nof them, especially the ones that were substantive.” Transcript of Comey Hearing, available at\n\nhttps://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-former-fbi-director-james-comey#.\n\nComey said he had memorialized these conversations out of concern that President Trump\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f“might lie about the nature of our meeting.” Id. In such a scenario, he wanted a\n\ncontemporaneous account “to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the\n\nindependence of our investigative function.” Id.\n\n       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       The same day that news spread of Comey’s memoranda, Plaintiff Cable News Network\n\nsubmitted a FOIA request for copies of “all records of notes taken by or communications sent\n\nfrom FBI Director James Comey regarding or documenting interactions (including interviews\n\nand other conversations) with President Donald Trump.” Def. MSJ (First Declaration of David\n\nM. Hardy), ¶ 6; see also id., Exh. CNN-B (CNN FOIA Request). CNN was not the only one\n\ninterested in the Comey Memos. Plaintiffs Daily Caller News Foundation, non-profit\n\norganizations Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, and USA Today (the business name of\n\nGannett Satellite Information Network), along with its reporter Brad Heath, the James Madison\n\nProject, and journalists Garrett Graff and Lachlan Markay, all submitted FOIA requests to the\n\nsame end. See First Hardy Decl., ¶¶ 14, 21, 30, 37, 44. Some Plaintiffs (including the USA\n\nToday group and Freedom Watch) sought additional related records, which are outside the scope\n\nof the instant summary-judgment motions. See, e.g., id., ¶ 44.\n\n       The Department of Justice responded to each request by letter dated June 16, 2017,\n\ninvoking Exemption 7(A) to withhold all documents. To wit, it stated: “The records responsive\n\nto your request are law enforcement records. There is a pending or prospective law enforcement\n\nproceeding relevant to these responsive records, and the release of the information could\n\nreasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Id., Exhs. CNN-F, USA\n\nToday-D, JMP/Graff-D, JMP/Markay-C, JW-D, FW-D. Undeterred, all Plaintiffs timely brought\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\factions in this Court, suing, variously, the FBI and DOJ. The Court consolidated their cases on\n\nJuly 31, 2017. See Minute Order.\n\n       Four months later, the Government moved for partial summary judgment as to all\n\nrequests related to the Comey Memos, and Plaintiffs, in turn, filed cross-motions for the same.\n\nTo bolster its case, the Department of Justice also sought leave to introduce an ex parte and in\n\ncamera affidavit from David W. Archey, a Deputy Assistant Director with the\n\nCounterintelligence Division, who currently supervises all FBI personnel assigned to the\n\ninvestigation into Russia’s interference with the 2016 Presidential election. See ECF No. 23.\n\nAfter the parties finished briefing, the Court granted the Government’s request and ordered, at\n\nPlaintiffs’ behest, that it also produce all withheld Memos for in camera review. See Minute\n\nOrder of Jan. 11, 2018.\n\n       The Court reviewed those submissions and, out of an abundance of caution, thought it\n\nhelpful to seek more specifics as to the Memos’ connection with an ongoing investigation. It\n\ntherefore asked that an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel proffer such information.\n\nMichael R. Dreeben, who serves as Counsel to the Special Counsel, did so in a sealed, on-the-\n\nrecord ex parte session. Finally, in response to this Court’s follow-up questions about that sealed\n\nproffer, the Government submitted the Third Declaration of David W. Archey in camera and ex\n\nparte. See ECF No. 47. (The agency previously moved to submit the Second Declaration of\n\nDavid W. Archey regarding records other than the Memos, see ECF No. 46, and the Court has\n\nnot yet ruled on that motion.) Although none of this material is currently available to Plaintiffs,\n\nall forms part of the record that could be reviewed on appeal or in any subsequent litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fII.

Analysis\n\n       The country (or at least the Beltway) has spent months abuzz about the Comey Memos\n\nand what they might reveal. Despite rampant media speculation, however, the Memos\n\nthemselves have remained out of public view. The Government hopes to keep it that way, but to\n\nwithhold release under FOIA, it must satisfy two elements. First, it must “demonstrate the . . .\n\nadequacy of the search” for relevant documents. Perry v. Block, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406603\"><a href=\"/opinion/406603/charles-e-perry-v-john-r-block-secretary-of-agriculture/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (D.C.

Adequacy of Search\n\n       “An agency fulfills its obligations under FOIA if it can demonstrate beyond material\n\ndoubt that its search was ‘reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.’” Valencia-\n\nLucena v.

That group then confirmed that\n\nthe located materials “were, in fact, the full set of memos.” Id. Just to play it safe, the\n\nGovernment has also double checked with the Special Counsel’s Office, which has since\n\ncompiled the Memos. They, too, concluded that the FBI had located all of Comey’s records.\n\nSee Second Hardy Decl., ¶ 4. In sum, “[t]he FBI is confident that it has identified and located\n\nthe entire collection of documents comprising the ‘Comey Memos.’” Id.\n\n       Two Plaintiffs, nevertheless, remain unconvinced. Daily Caller and USA Today argue\n\nthat the agency has not adequately explained its search efforts, variously noting that “the FBI did\n\nnot conduct its search using the standard method of searching its Central Records System,” USA\n\nToday Br. at 5, and that the agency must “identify the number of records they located.” DCNF\n\nBr. at 6. Neither argument holds water.\n\n       While querying an electronic database may be appropriate in the mine-run FOIA foray,\n\nthe requests here center on a “discrete set of extraordinarily high-profile” and easily identifiable\n\nrecords — namely, any memoranda that then-Director Comey wrote documenting his\n\nconversations with President Trump.

Valid Exemption\n\n       Although the Government invokes a slew of exemptions — including 1, 3, 6, 7(C) and\n\n7(E) — to justify withholding the Memos, it primarily leans on Exemption 7(A).

As a threshold matter,\n\nthe Court must determine whether the withheld “records or information” were “compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). If the agency so establishes, it must then\n\ndemonstrate that a particular subpart of Exemption 7 applies. Here, it must show that release of\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fthose records “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Id.\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(A). The Court discusses each requirement in turn.\n\n               1. Exemption 7 Threshold\n\n       The Government offers two explanations as to why the Comey Memos satisfy Exemption\n\n7’s threshold requirement. First, it says that they contain information that was originally\n\ncompiled as part of the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference. See Def. Reply at 10.\n\nSecond, it indicates that the Memos themselves have since been compiled for law-enforcement\n\npurposes. Id. at 2, 10. The Court focuses on this latter theory, as it alone would place “all\n\nportions” of the Memos within Exemption 7’s purview. Id. at 10.\n\n       DOJ’s public briefing (however vague) suggests that the Comey Memos “have been\n\ncompiled into[] the ongoing investigation by the Special Counsel into Russian interference in the\n\n2016 election.” Id. at 2. By way of background, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\n\nappointed Robert S. Mueller as Special Counsel on May 17, 2017. The Office of Special\n\nCounsel has revealed little about the scope of its investigation, but Rosenstein’s initial order\n\nauthorized Mueller to investigate “(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian\n\ngovernment and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and (ii)\n\nany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and (iii) any other matters\n\nwith the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).” DOJ Order No. 3915–2017 (May 17, 2017). Under that\n\nsection, the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction includes “the authority to investigate and prosecute\n\nfederal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special\n\nCounsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and\n\nintimidation of witnesses.” Although the Government has been tight-lipped in its briefing about\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fexactly why the Special Counsel compiled these Memos, the First Archey Declaration confirms\n\nthat the Office did so for law-enforcement purposes — i.e., in service of that investigation.\n\n       Without reviewing the Archey Declaration, Plaintiffs, of course, are somewhat hamstrung\n\nin their ability to dispute this position. Instead, they focus their fire on Comey’s intent when he\n\nfirst created the Memos. CNN, Judicial Watch, and Daily Caller argue that the Director, by his\n\nown admission, penned these Memos not “in furtherance of an investigation but for ‘political’\n\npurposes,” to “preserv[e] the FBI’s integrity as an institution.” CNN Br. at 15–17; see also JW\n\nBr. at 11; DCNF Br. at 9–10. That may be so, but it matters not if the Memos “were generated\n\non an earlier occasion and for a different purpose.” John Doe Agency v.

Rather, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “objects sought merely\n\nmust have been ‘compiled’ when the Government invokes the Exemption.” Id. at 153. In other\n\nwords, Exemption 7 applies to “materials originally collected for a benign purpose” so long as\n\nthey were “eventually . . . compiled or incorporated into a law-enforcement investigatory file.”\n\nGould Inc. v.

Comey’s intent —\n\nwhatever it was — is therefore irrelevant for Exemption 7 purposes.\n\n       The Government thus need show only that it has since “compiled” the Memos for law-\n\nenforcement purposes, a bar it easily clears. The Supreme Court “has given a fairly broad\n\nmeaning to ‘compiled’ under § 552(b)(7),” Milner v.

The D.C. Circuit, too, has explained that “the\n\nterm ‘compiled’ in Exemption 7 requires that a document be created, gathered, or used by an\n\nagency for law enforcement purposes at some time before the agency invokes the exemption.”\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fPub.

First up, CNN correctly points out that in order to rely on 7(A), the agency must\n\nhave compiled the documents before it invoked that exemption on June 16, 2017. See Pub.\n\nEmployees, 740 F.3d at 203. In his public testimony on June 8, Comey averred, on two separate\n\noccasions, that he had already turned over his copies of the Memos to the Special Counsel team.\n\nSee Transcript of Comey Hearing. It stands to reason, then, that the Special Counsel had\n\ncompiled them by at least that date. The Government has also submitted another ex parte\n\nArchey Declaration clarifying that the Special Counsel had indeed assembled the Comey Memos\n\nbefore June 16. See Third Archey Decl., ¶ 4.\n\n        Next, Daily Caller highlights that “the FBI searched for and located records in archived,\n\nadministrative files,” rather than “in the Special Counsel’s files.” DCNF Br. at 10. This is true,\n\nbut irrelevant. As explained earlier, the exemption applies to “documents already collected by\n\nthe Government originally for non-law-enforcement purposes.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at\n\n153. Naturally enough, copies of those documents might remain in their original, innocuous file.\n\nBut a “plaintiff may not circumvent the effect of Exemption 7 by seeking information in the\n\ninvestigatory file from other unprotected government sources.” Gould, 688 F. Supp. at 698 n.23.\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNor does the agency lose Exemption 7 protection simply because it happened to search for the\n\ndocuments there, rather than in the Special Counsel’s files. The fact that “other copies exist in\n\ngovernment files does not strip these documents — and the information they contain — of their\n\nexemption from disclosure.” Id.; see also John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 153 (approvingly citing\n\nGould).\n\n               2. Exemption 7(A)\n\n       The Court turns now to whether releasing the Memos “could reasonably be expected to\n\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). In enacting this exemption,\n\n“Congress recognized that law enforcement agencies had legitimate needs to keep certain records\n\nconfidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations.” NLRB v.

To that end, “Exemption 7(A) does not require a\n\npresently pending ‘enforcement proceeding.’” Ctr. for Nat’l Security, 331 F.3d at 926.

It cannot, however, act as a rubber stamp simply because the agency\n\n“assert[s] that disclosure will interfere with enforcement proceedings; it must rather demonstrate\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fhow disclosure will do so.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court concluded that\n\nDOJ’s initial submissions fell short in that respect, as they lacked “specific information about the\n\nimpact of the disclosures” or the “individual or entity that is the subject of the ongoing\n\ninvestigation.” Id. at 129–30. Even after an in camera review of the First Archey Declaration\n\nand the Memos themselves, the Court asked an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel to\n\nmake an on-the-record proffer about the investigation. Having heard this, the Court is now fully\n\nconvinced that disclosure “could reasonably be expected to interfere” with that ongoing\n\ninvestigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).\n\n       In disputing that conclusion, Plaintiffs make much of the fact that Comey himself\n\ntestified about the contents of at least some Memos. In light of those public statements, they\n\nwonder how much damage release could inflict now. While Comey may have testified about\n\nsome material in his Memos, he has never disseminated copies publicly. As the D.C. Circuit has\n\nheld, “[T]he fact that information exists in some form in the public domain does not necessarily\n\nmean that official disclosure will not cause harm cognizable under a FOIA exemption.” Wolf v.\n\nCIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186834\"><a href=\"/opinion/186834/wolf-paul-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (D.C.

On the contrary, the\n\nDepartment has been mum on the accuracy of his testimony. The important point is that until the\n\nMemos are released, the public (or potential witnesses) cannot know how accurate his recall of\n\nthe Memos’ contents was. And perhaps more to the point, they cannot gauge “the level of detail\n\nin the memos” and “the extent to which they contain information that was not the subject of his\n\ntestimony.” Gov’t Reply at 15–16.\n\n       C.

Public Testimony\n\n       This Circuit employs a three-part test to determine whether the public-domain doctrine\n\napplies: (1) the “information requested must be as specific as the information previously\n\nreleased”; (2) “the information requested must match the information previously disclosed”; and\n\n(3) “the information requested must already have been made public through an official and\n\ndocumented disclosure.” Am.

As\n\ndiscussed above, his paraphrased statements do not necessarily “match” any portion of his\n\nMemos, nor are they necessarily as “specific” as the original. Id. The D.C. Circuit has\n\n“insist[ed] on exactitude” as to these requirements, and “[p]rior disclosure of similar information\n\ndoes not suffice; instead, the specific information sought by the plaintiff must already be in the\n\npublic domain by official disclosure.” Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (emphasis omitted). In this case,\n\nthe Director’s oral account of the Memos is no substitute for the written hard copy. See, e.g., id.\n\n(holding that although former CIA Director had officially acknowledged “existence” of records\n\nby reading from them during congressional testimony, agency could still establish that\n\n“contents” of those records were exempt).\n\n       In any event, Comey no longer served as FBI Director when he testified and therefore\n\nlacked any authority to make official releases on that agency’s behalf.

Disclosure to Professor Richman\n\n       In his congressional testimony, Comey also admitted that he had shared a copy of at least\n\nhis February 14 Memo with a “good friend” who is “a professor at Columbia law school.”\n\nTranscript of Comey Hearing. The Plaintiffs presume this friend to be Professor Daniel\n\nRichman, see, e.g., CNN SOMF, ¶ 34; JW SOMF, ¶ 48, and the Government does not directly\n\ndispute that assertion. See Gov’t Response to CNN’s SOMF, ¶ 34; Response to JW’S SOMF,\n\n¶¶ 35-48. The Court therefore adopts the same assumption and considers whether the February\n\n14 Memo (or any others disclosed to Richman) must be released.\n\n       The parties debate exactly when Comey made that disclosure, as the Government says it\n\nis “unaware” whether “Director Comey, during his tenure as Director, publicly shared the\n\nmemos, their contents, or details about the conversations they document.” Second Hardy Decl.,\n\n¶ 6. But even if it occurred before his termination, Comey apparently never intended to do so in\n\nhis official capacity; rather, at the time, he considered the Memos his “own personal”\n\nrecollections, which he “felt free to share” “[a]s a private citizen.” Transcript of Comey Hearing.\n\nConsequently, the Department reports that it “has not located any documented official disclosure\n\nof the memos or their contents.” Second Hardy Decl., ¶ 6. Against that backdrop, the Director’s\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fentrustment of his then-personal Memos to a friend falls short of an “official and documented\n\ndisclosure.” ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21 (“[T]he information requested must already have been\n\nmade public through an official and documented disclosure.”). That alone could defeat\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims.\n\n        At any rate, Comey’s limited disclosure to one friend, even if made in his official\n\ncapacity, is insufficient to waive Exemption 7(A) protection. The D.C. Circuit has counseled\n\nthat “while the logic of FOIA postulates that an exemption can serve no purpose once\n\ninformation . . . becomes public, we must be confident that the information sought is truly public\n\nand that the requester receive no more than what is publicly available before we find a waiver.”\n\nCottone, 193 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation and citation omitted). For the public-domain\n\ndoctrine to apply, the specific information sought must have already been “disclosed and\n\npreserved in a permanent public record.” Id. at 554; see also Davis v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586798\"><a href=\"/opinion/586798/john-davis-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n        In this case, the withheld documents are far from “truly public.” On the contrary, they\n\nexist — at most — in one law professor’s possession. Professor Richman’s home or office\n\nhardly qualifies as the “public domain.” The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Students Against\n\nGenocide v. Department of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185496\"><a href=\"/opinion/185496/students-agnst-v-dos/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2001), is instructive on this point.\n\nThere, the Court of Appeals considered classified “spy satellite” and “spy plane” photographs\n\nthat then-U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright had shown to foreign delegates of the United\n\nNations Security Council. Id. at 830. The plaintiff organizations argued that Ambassador\n\nAlbright had waived the pertinent FOIA exemptions by such display. Id. at 836. The Circuit\n\nrejected that position, explaining that the photographs “plainly [did] not fall within the [public-\n\ndomain] doctrine. They were not released to the general public; only the Security Council\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fdelegates saw them.” Id.; see also Muslim Advocates v. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n101–02 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding public-domain doctrine did not apply to FBI’s Domestic\n\nInvestigations and Operations Guide, even though agency had allowed several civil-rights groups\n\nto view and take notes on disputed chapters).\n\n       True, Professor Richman (at least at one point) may have possessed some subset of the\n\nMemos, whereas the delegates in Students Against Genocide only saw the withheld photographs.\n\nThat difference, however, is of no moment. As an initial matter, Richman has publicly reported\n\nreturning all documents to the FBI. See Matt Zapotosky, Comey Friend Says He Is ‘Turning\n\nOver Relevant’ Documents to FBI, Wash. Post (June 13, 2017),\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/ live-updates/trump-white-house/sessions-to-\n\ntestify-before-senate-intelligence-committee/comey-friend-says-he-is-turning-over-relevant-\n\ndocuments-to-fbi/?utm_term=.78194270be35. If that is so, it is clear that no “permanent public\n\nrecord[s]” remain of the Memos. See Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554.\n\n       Even if Richman retained copies, that would not vitiate the agency’s exemption. In\n\narguing otherwise, Plaintiffs latch onto language in Students Against Genocide stating that “a\n\ndisclosure made to any FOIA requester is effectively a disclosure to the world at large.” 257\n\nF.3d at 826 (emphasis added). They argue by analogy that a disclosure made to any person has\n\nthe same effect, but that is a bridge too far. Comey’s discretionary release of documents to a\n\nclose friend is hardly analogous to the agency’s release of information due to statutory\n\nobligation. In the latter scenario, it is reasonable to assume that the requester will publicize the\n\nmaterial, and neither the agency nor court has any basis to “limit that dissemination.” Id. Here,\n\nby contrast, Comey apparently made a judgment call that he could entrust at least one Memo to\n\nRichman without their broader release. His choice to do so did not automatically catapult those\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fdocuments into the public domain, and the Court will not assume Richman will release them\n\nmore widely absent evidence to the contrary.\n\n       In fact, at this point — almost nine months since Comey could have shared any Memo in\n\nhis official capacity — Richman has still not released anything. Although he, apparently at\n\nComey’s behest, described the contents of the February 14 Memo to the New York Times, the\n\nnewspaper made clear that it had “not viewed a copy of the memo”; instead, Richman “read parts\n\nof it to a Times reporter.” Schmidt, Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn\n\nInvestigation, N.Y. Times (May 16, 2017). To the extent Richman still holds copies, he has kept\n\nthem close to his vest. Were it otherwise, Plaintiffs would have little need to seek the Memos by\n\nway of FOIA.\n\n       In like circumstances, “courts generally find no waiver under § 552(b)(7)(A) even though\n\nthere has been a limited, discretionary disclosure.” Anderson v. Dep’t of Treasury, No. 98-1112,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">282784</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 24, 1999); see also Erb v. Dep’t of Justice, 572 F.\n\nSupp. 954, 956 (W.D. Mich. 1983) (holding that there had been no waiver of Exemption 7(A)\n\neven where prosecutor had disclosed FBI report to counsel for target of investigation). Similarly,\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has noted that with respect to classified information, “a limited disclosure to a\n\nsmall number of individuals might not be enough to render classification inappropriate.”\n\nAncient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"214764\"><a href=\"/opinion/214764/ancient-coin-collectors-v-us-dept-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n       The Court acknowledges that this situation is rather unprecedented; it is not every day\n\nthat an FBI Director feels the need to memorialize his conversations with a sitting President and\n\nthen publicize that he did so. But the caselaw aligns with common sense. The public-domain\n\ndoctrine exists because release of a “truly public” document can do little harm to the agency’s\n\ninterests; in that case, the exemption “can serve no purpose.” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555. Here, by\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fcontrast, the Memos are possibly held by one person outside the agency, and the Bureau and\n\nSpecial Counsel still have something to lose by their dissemination to the broader public. The\n\nCourt therefore holds that Comey’s release of any documents to his close friend does not waive\n\nthe agency’s otherwise valid Exemption 7(A) defense.\n\n               3. Other Arguments\n\n       Plaintiffs also raise an array of other arguments for waiver, but the Court can dispose of\n\neach in short order. First, USA Today contends that this Court has discretion to treat “President\n\nTrump’s public denial of the substantive accuracy of Director Comey’s claims [as] incorporating\n\nby reference the substance of what Director Comey said occurred.” USA Today Br. at 12.\n\nPlaintiff’s logic is a bit hard to parse, and it admits to lacking any “case law on-point” for its\n\nposition, but the upshot seems to be that the President’s denials somehow constitute an “official\n\ndisclosure” of any referenced Memo’s contents. Id. at 11. This theory suffers at least two flaws.\n\nFirst, Trump repudiated Comey’s testimony; he never discussed nor purported to know the\n\ncontents of the Memos themselves. He therefore could not have “incorporated” that information\n\nby reference into any official disclosure. Second, the President’s denials hardly recited any\n\nportion of the Memos verbatim and thus are not as “specific” as the records sought nor an exact\n\n“match” for their content. See ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21.\n\n       Daily Caller and Judicial Watch next argue that the FBI “officially acknowledged”\n\nComey’s testimony when it failed to “dispute, disavow, [or] even disagree” with it. See DCNF\n\nBr. at 13; see also JW Br. at 15. Far from “an official and documented disclosure,” however, the\n\nagency’s silence is just that — silence. See ACLU, 628 F.3d at 620–21. It had no duty to\n\nrespond to an ex-employee’s testimony, and it has, by design, disclosed nothing about whether\n\nComey’s statements were an accurate synopsis of the Memos or as detailed as the originals.\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f       Finally, Judicial Watch maintains that the agency itself revealed the “potential connection\n\nbetween the memo [concerning the Flynn discussion] and Special Counsel Mueller’s\n\ninvestigation.” JW Reply at 3. It suggests that voluntarily disclosing this connection somehow\n\n“undermines” the agency’s entire Exemption 7(A) defense, such that it must now disclose the\n\nMemo in toto. Id. Plaintiff invokes Labow v. Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n\n2016), but such reliance is quite a stretch. In Labow, the Government resisted the release of\n\ndocuments under Exemption 3, which protects, inter alia, materials related to a grand jury’s\n\nidentity, investigation, or deliberation. Id. at 529–30. The agency contended that although the\n\ndocuments were not damning when standing alone, a grand jury had subpoenaed them, such that\n\nrelease would “reveal the direction” of its investigation. Id. at 529. The Court of Appeals\n\nrejected that argument, noting that the Government had blown its own cover by linking the\n\ndocuments to the grand jury in the first place. Id. at 529–30.\n\n       By contrast, DOJ does not argue here that release of the documents is harmful merely\n\nbecause they are in the Special Counsel’s folder. Instead, Justice seeks to protect the contents of\n\nthe Memos, as release would reveal “the level of detail in the memos, the extent to which they\n\ncorroborate Mr. Comey’s testimony, and the extent to which they contain information that was\n\nnot the subject of his testimony.” Def. Reply 15–16. None of that information is public, and\n\nExemption 7(A) thus applies with full force.\n\n       D.      Segregability\n\n       Even if this Court stops short of releasing some or all Memos in full, Plaintiffs\n\nalternatively ask that it require the Department to turn over any non-exempt portions of those\n\nrecords. See, e.g., CNN Br. at 28-29. FOIA requires that an agency produce “[a]ny reasonably\n\nsegregable portion” of a record “after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f§ 552(b). In making a determination as to segregability or any other question under FOIA, a\n\ndistrict court judge “may examine the contents of . . . agency records in camera.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B); see also Armstrong, 97 F.3d at 578–79. That analysis, however, “does not call\n\nfor parsing the [Comey Memos] ‘line-by-line’ or segregating material ‘dispersed throughout the\n\ndocument,’” as Plaintiffs suggest. See Nat’l Ass’n of Crim. Defense Lawyers v. DOJ Exec.\n\nOffice for U.S. Attorneys, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (D.C.

(quoting Mead\n\nData, 566 at 261 n.54).\n\n       Here, the Government asserts that no “logically divisible” section of the Memos is\n\nsegregable. Indeed, releasing any portion would necessarily reveal their “level of detail,” as well\n\nas the extent to which those records do — or do not — corroborate Comey’s testimony or\n\ninclude any information omitted from that public account. See Def. Reply 15–16. The Court has\n\nreviewed the disputed documents in camera and confirmed that no portion is reasonably\n\nsegregable.\n\n       It stresses, however, that Exemption 7(A) is temporal in nature and not designed to\n\n“endlessly protect material simply because it [is] in an investigatory file.” Robbins Tire &\n\nRubber, 437 U.S. at 230.

Rule 56(d) Discovery\n\n        Finally, Freedom Watch moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) to place the\n\nsummary-judgment proceedings on ice until it can conduct discovery. Under that Rule, a court\n\nmay defer considering a motion for summary judgment, deny the motion, or allow time for the\n\nnon-movant to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery if that party “shows by\n\naffidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its\n\nopposition.” Such an affidavit must state “with sufficient particularity why additional discovery\n\nis necessary.” United States ex rel.

Specifically, the non-movant’s\n\naffidavit must: (1) “outline the particular facts the non-movant intends to discover and describe\n\nwhy those facts are necessary to the litigation”; (2) “explain why the non-movant could not\n\nproduce the facts in opposition to the motion for summary judgment”; and (3) “show the\n\ninformation is in fact discoverable.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiff asks this Court to allow discovery or, alternatively, to “review all responsive\n\ndocumentation in camera and then inform the parties of its determination of which of the\n\ndocuments, if any, truly fall under any valid FOIA exemption.” FW Br. at 5. Now that the Court\n\nhas followed this latter course, it is not clear whether Freedom Watch’s request for discovery still\n\nstands. To the extent it does, the Court denies it. Plaintiff never makes clear exactly what it\n\nseeks in discovery, other than noting that the agency has “failed to even provide a Vaughn\n\nindex,” which would catalog the documents withheld. Id. at 4. But the agency has now provided\n\nthe Court with the actual Comey Memos, giving it all materials needed to evaluate Exemption\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f7(A). Plaintiff has thus failed to identify any other documents that might be “necessary to the\n\nlitigation.” Folliard, 764 F.3d at 26 (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and denies Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motions. It also denies Plaintiff Freedom Watch’s Motion\n\nfor Relief under Rule 56(d).
