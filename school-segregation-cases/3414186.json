The commissioner has accordingly withheld said moneys, and the city to compel him to pay over the same has brought this suit by way of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 170</span> \npetition for a writ of mandamus. Upon the trial in the circuit court the writ was awarded; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p>Many interesting questions are raised, and have been ably argued at the bar. We shall consider only one of these, as it is decisive so far as concerns the funds held as aforesaid. That question is whether the tax here imposed on insurance premiums is in contravention of the equality requirements of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>\"The guaranty of `equal protection of the laws' . . . does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the objects to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate. It merely requires that all persons subject to such legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in privileges conferred and liability imposed. It is not infringed by legislation which applies ony to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable grounds exist for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.\" Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, vol. 2 (8 Ed.), pp. 824, 825. \"A classification for purposes of taxation must rest on some reasonable distinction,\" <em>Schlesinger</em> v.<em>Wisconsin,</em> <cross_reference>270 U.S. 230</cross_reference>, 240, 46 S.Ct. 260, 261, 70 L.Ed. 557, 564, 43 A.L.R. 1224; and a tax statute is void which contains classifications that are not based on any substantial difference or reason, 12 C.J., p. 1152. While reasonable classification is permitted, such classification must be based upon some real and substantial distinction which bears a reasonable, just, and proper relation to the objects sought to be accomplished, and this within the field of the subject-matter concerning which the classification is made, or in other words, the classification and the object to be accomplished must be germane. 6 R.C.L., pp. 381, 382; <em>Adams</em> v. <em>Standard Oil Co.,</em> <cross_reference>97 Miss. 879</cross_reference>, 53 So. 692;<em>Sorenson</em> v. <em>Webb,</em> <cross_reference>111 Miss. 87</cross_reference>, 71 So. 273; <em>Adams</em> v.<em>Mississippi Lbr.

St. Rep. 476.</p>\n<p>These in brief are the tests, and they are that, in actual substance, reasonable grounds must exist for making a distinction between those who fall within the burdened class and those who do not, and the classification made must be germane to the immediate object in view.</p>\n<p>Thus there is at once presented the inquiry, What is the reason, the substantial reason, not one which is merely arbitrary or artificial, for the difference or distinction here made by which a certain class, from among all those directly and materially concerned in the subject-matter, is segregated, and upon that class the burden of a certain fixed tax is laid, while no such tax or the relative equivalent thereof is laid upon others likewise concerned? The principal answer that has been offered is that the establishment and adequate maintenance of a fund of this sort tends to attract to the fire-fighting service a better character of men and to make that service a more dependable and loyal branch of the municipal administration, with the result that there will be an improved efficiency in the prevention of fires and in the lessening of losses by fire, thereby saving more to insurance companies than the amount of the tax imposed.</p>\n<p>We cheerfully concede the worthiness of the object and the soundness of the considerations mentioned touching the betterment of the service; and the answer made, we may also concede, would be good in point of law if all combustible property in the municipality were insured in admitted companies at or near its full insurable value. Unfortunately, however, in weighing the aforesaid answer, we are confronted, not with the situation last mentioned, but with what is true to the contrary as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 172</span> \na matter of common knowledge: First, that a part of the valuable combustible property is not insured at all; second, that a yet larger part, if not most of it, is not fully insured; and third, that some part is insured in outside companies not formally admitted and which therefore are not subject to the tax in question. There can be no question that the duty of a municipal fire department is the same towards all combustible valuable property within the municipality. It owes no greater duty towards property insured for its full insurable value than it does in respect to property not insured; its duty to partly insured property is the same as that in regard to fully insured property or to property not insured at all, and still the same towards property insured in outside companies. Such is the legal duty, but we may as well be candid enough to admit at the same time that if the average fire department should find that it could save only one of two burning buildings one of them insured and the other not, the uninsured buiding would be the more likely to be saved. This would be but a natural human impulse and personal course of action.</p>\n<p>If then the legal duty of the fire-fighting department is as much owed towards uninsured property as towards that which is insured, and if, as we know, the personal element in an extreme emergency would favor the uninsured, it must be obvious that the answer above adverted to becomes no answer at all in point of substantial reason for the attempted distinction or classification; and no other answer as good as that mentioned has been advanced. For instance, among these answers it is in effect argued that although the duty to all species of combustible property insured and uninsured is the same, yet there is in the<em>status</em> of owners as owners, as distinguished from insurers as such, a sufficiency of distinction that upon this difference in<em>status</em> the classification may be legally upheld. It is true that such a difference <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 173</span> \nmight serve for a classification for some purpose, but the argument and every similar argument overlooks the requirement that the reason upon which the classification is grounded must be a reason which has a just and substantial relation to the particular object to be accomplished &#8212; an object which is a public one, for it is fundamental that no tax may be laid to raise funds for a mere private or personal purpose. The contemplated public object to be accomplished here is the improvement of the service in the fire-fighting department, and since that improvement moves in its benefits and advantages as much and in exactly the same way towards the uninsured owner of property of a certain value as it does towards an insurance company carrying a policy in an equal amount in value on another piece of property, there is no actual difference between the two in relation to the object to be accomplished. And every argument advanced to sustain this tax runs likewise into a corner.</p>\n<p>Under those arguments, if the tax here in question may be imposed upon fire insurance companies, then upon like principles it may be extended and these companies could be required to pay the entire expense of a city fire department, and by a parity of reasoning there could be added all the costs of construction, extension, and operation of the waterworks department, since a modern fire-fighting department is essentially dependent upon an adequate water supply. By like, or even by better, reasoning, the banks and jewelers of a city could be required to pay the entire costs of the police department on the ground that banks and jewelry stores are distinct beneficiaries of police protection against burglaries and robberies; and so on as to many other features of municipal administration.</p>\n<p>The situation here in question is well put by the supreme court of Louisiana in <em>State</em> v. <em>Merchants' Ins. Co.,</em> 12 La. Ann. 802, a case upon the exact subject we are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 174</span> \nhere considering, in which the court said: \"But in the case before us there is no property improved or assessed; . . . one class of corporations is taxed an invariable sum for the benefit of another class; there is no possibility of ascertaining whether the tax is a <em>quid pro quo;</em> the fire companies are not compelled by the law to do anything for the insurance companies; a bounty is secured to the fire department by confiscating the money of the defendants, without providing that any service shall be rendered to the defendants by the fire department; and even if this could, for a moment, be regarded as an assessment for benefits conferred, its inequality is glaring; every owner of buildings and other combustible property in New Orleans, who is either wholly or in part his own underwriter, is presumed to be benefited by the fire department in the same way as the insurance companies are. Why should the companies alone pay taxes for this common benefit? Again; large amounts of property in New Orleans are insured abroad in offices which have no public agencies here; those offices are likewise as much benefited by the fire department as the New Orleans offices are; and yet they can be made to pay no tax under this law which is personal to the companies domiciled or represented in New Orleans.\" See, also,<em>Philadelphia Ass'n for Relief of Disabled Firemen</em> v. <em>Wood,</em><cross_reference>39 Pa. 73</cross_reference>; <em>San Francisco</em> v. <em>Liverpool  L.

Cas. 254.</p>\n<p>We have proceeded to this point upon the assumption that the tax laid is to be paid in no other way than by the insurance companies themselves, that it is to come solely out of their own funds, and that they alone would ever feel the burden of the exaction. Upon that definite assumption we have endeavored to show that the tax is in contravention of the equality provisions of the Federal Constitution and that we should so declare, as we do declare and hold for the reasons above set out. But we now go further and point to the concluding paragraph of section 7 of the act. It is there seen that there is an unmistakable provision for the addition of this tax, with the consent of the rating bureau, to the premiums fixed and collected in the said municipality. When this tax is added to the premiums collected in the municipality, then we would have in real substance nothing more nor less than a situation where those who insure are paying the tax, while those who do not insure pay nothing of it; and that this then would be a discriminatory and unequal tax is too plain to require a discussion. It would be more reasonable to require that those who do not insure at all shall pay the tax; for fire losses to them are total losses, whereas when property is insured there is an amelioration of the burden of the loss, because borne jointly by the insured and the insurer.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed, and petition dismissed.</em> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 176</span> </p>",

The principal answer that has been offered is that the establishment and adequate maintenance of a fund of this sort tends to attract to the fire-fighting service a better character of men and to make that service a more dependable and loyal branch of the municipal administration, with the result that there will be an improved efficiency in the prevention of fires and in the lessening of losses by fire, thereby saving more to insurance companies than the amount of the tax imposed.</p>\n<p>We cheerfully concede the worthiness of the object and the soundness of the considerations mentioned touching the betterment of the service; and the answer made, we may also concede, would be good in point of law if all combustible property in the municipality were insured in admitted companies at or near its full insurable value. Unfortunately, however, in weighing the aforesaid answer, we are confronted, not with the situation last mentioned, but with what is true to the contrary as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 172</span> \na matter of common knowledge: First, that a part of the valuable combustible property is not insured at all; second, that a yet larger part, if not most of it, is not fully insured; and third, that some part is insured in outside companies not formally admitted and which therefore are not subject to the tax in question. There can be no question that the duty of a municipal fire department is the same towards all combustible valuable property within the municipality. It owes no greater duty towards property insured for its full insurable value than it does in respect to property not insured; its duty to partly insured property is the same as that in regard to fully insured property or to property not insured at all, and still the same towards property insured in outside companies. Such is the legal duty, but we may as well be candid enough to admit at the same time that if the average fire department should find that it could save only one of two burning buildings one of them insured and the other not, the uninsured buiding would be the more likely to be saved. This would be but a natural human impulse and personal course of action.</p>\n<p>If then the legal duty of the fire-fighting department is as much owed towards uninsured property as towards that which is insured, and if, as we know, the personal element in an extreme emergency would favor the uninsured, it must be obvious that the answer above adverted to becomes no answer at all in point of substantial reason for the attempted distinction or classification; and no other answer as good as that mentioned has been advanced. For instance, among these answers it is in effect argued that although the duty to all species of combustible property insured and uninsured is the same, yet there is in the<em>status</em> of owners as owners, as distinguished from insurers as such, a sufficiency of distinction that upon this difference in<em>status</em> the classification may be legally upheld. It is true that such a difference <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 173</span> \nmight serve for a classification for some purpose, but the argument and every similar argument overlooks the requirement that the reason upon which the classification is grounded must be a reason which has a just and substantial relation to the particular object to be accomplished &#8212; an object which is a public one, for it is fundamental that no tax may be laid to raise funds for a mere private or personal purpose. The contemplated public object to be accomplished here is the improvement of the service in the fire-fighting department, and since that improvement moves in its benefits and advantages as much and in exactly the same way towards the uninsured owner of property of a certain value as it does towards an insurance company carrying a policy in an equal amount in value on another piece of property, there is no actual difference between the two in relation to the object to be accomplished. And every argument advanced to sustain this tax runs likewise into a corner.</p>\n<p>Under those arguments, if the tax here in question may be imposed upon fire insurance companies, then upon like principles it may be extended and these companies could be required to pay the entire expense of a city fire department, and by a parity of reasoning there could be added all the costs of construction, extension, and operation of the waterworks department, since a modern fire-fighting department is essentially dependent upon an adequate water supply. By like, or even by better, reasoning, the banks and jewelers of a city could be required to pay the entire costs of the police department on the ground that banks and jewelry stores are distinct beneficiaries of police protection against burglaries and robberies; and so on as to many other features of municipal administration.</p>\n<p>The situation here in question is well put by the supreme court of Louisiana in <em>State</em> v. <em>Merchants' Ins. Co.,</em> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">La. Ann.</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></span>, a case upon the exact subject we are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 174</span> \nhere considering, in which the court said: \"But in the case before us there is no property improved or assessed; . . . one class of corporations is taxed an invariable sum for the benefit of another class; there is no possibility of ascertaining whether the tax is a <em>quid pro quo;</em> the fire companies are not compelled by the law to do anything for the insurance companies; a bounty is secured to the fire department by confiscating the money of the defendants, without providing that any service shall be rendered to the defendants by the fire department; and even if this could, for a moment, be regarded as an assessment for benefits conferred, its inequality is glaring; every owner of buildings and other combustible property in New Orleans, who is either wholly or in part his own underwriter, is presumed to be benefited by the fire department in the same way as the insurance companies are. Why should the companies alone pay taxes for this common benefit? Again; large amounts of property in New Orleans are insured abroad in offices which have no public agencies here; those offices are likewise as much benefited by the fire department as the New Orleans offices are; and yet they can be made to pay no tax under this law which is personal to the companies domiciled or represented in New Orleans.\" See, also,<em>Philadelphia Ass'n for Relief of Disabled Firemen</em> v. <em>Wood,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span></cross_reference>; <em>San Francisco</em> v. <em>Liverpool  L.

Cas. 254.</p>\n<p>We have proceeded to this point upon the assumption that the tax laid is to be paid in no other way than by the insurance companies themselves, that it is to come solely out of their own funds, and that they alone would ever feel the burden of the exaction. Upon that definite assumption we have endeavored to show that the tax is in contravention of the equality provisions of the Federal Constitution and that we should so declare, as we do declare and hold for the reasons above set out. But we now go further and point to the concluding paragraph of section 7 of the act. It is there seen that there is an unmistakable provision for the addition of this tax, with the consent of the rating bureau, to the premiums fixed and collected in the said municipality. When this tax is added to the premiums collected in the municipality, then we would have in real substance nothing more nor less than a situation where those who insure are paying the tax, while those who do not insure pay nothing of it; and that this then would be a discriminatory and unequal tax is too plain to require a discussion. It would be more reasonable to require that those who do not insure at all shall pay the tax; for fire losses to them are total losses, whereas when property is insured there is an amelioration of the burden of the loss, because borne jointly by the insured and the insurer.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed, and petition dismissed.</em> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 176</span> </p>",

Lotterhos,  of Jackson, for appellees.\n\nAll legislative authority is vested in the legislature, as provided by section 33 of the Mississippi Constitution; and this Act, deemed by the legislature to be wise, necessary, and sufficient, must remain and be observed as the law of Mississippi unless it can be made to appear to this court that it as a whole violates some definite section of the Constitution.\n\n State  v.  Newman Lbr. Co.,   102 Miss. 802 , 59 So. 923.\n\nAll questions of economics, propriety, necessity, wisdom, and practicability have been settled favorable to the system by the legislature, which is the sole judge of these considerations. Systems of disability benefits and pensions for disabled public servants, particularly for firemen, are nothing new in this country, nor have they been for many years.\n\n726-7 of 19 Ruling Case Law;  Phoenix Assur. Co. of London  v. Fire Department  (Ala.), 23 So. 843.\n\nThe Statute does not violate section 96 of the Constitution.\n\n1 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5 Ed.), sec. 430;  Nebraska  ex rel.

Board of Education,   171 N.Y. 263 ;  Hammitt  v. Gaynor,  144 N.Y.S. 123.\n\n State  v.  Love, supra,  is directly in point upon this subject, and a similar distinction between pensions granted to employees who have left the service and those who are in service until retired is drawn in  Mahon  v.  Board of Education. \n  Wright  v.  Craig,  195 N.Y.S. 391;  Phoenix Assur. Co. of  London  v.  Fire Department  (Ala.), 23 So. 843;  Cobbs  v.  Home  Ins. Co.  (Ala.),  91 So. 627 ;  O'Dea  v.

Co.,   119 Miss. 783 , 81 So. 175.\n\nWe deny that the act violates the due process clauses of the above-named constitutional provisions and the equal protection clause of the latter, or that the tax on fire insurance companies is arbitrary, unjust, unequal and discriminatory.\n\n Mountain Timber Co.  v.  Washington,   243 U.S. 219 , 61 L.Ed. 685;  Rinehart  v.  State  (Tenn.), 117 S.W. 508.\n\nThat the legislature may make reasonable classifications for the purpose of taxation and that taxes resting on such basis are valid exercises of the legislative power, is so well settled both in Mississippi and elsewhere that we deem it unnecesary to do more than make reference to 37 Cyc. 746, and 26 R.C.L. 249.\n\nThere are numerous cases in the reports wherein various pension laws similar to that under consideration here have been upheld or merely applied without question. These additional cases are not directly on the points raised in this case, but a reference to them might be of some help to the court. Hence, reference to some of them is now made.\n\n Trustees of Exempt Firemen's  v.  Roome,   93 N.Y. 313 ; Firemen's Benevolent Ass'n  v.  Lownsbury,   21 Ill. 511 ; Trumper  v.

Stanton  (N.Y.),  54 N.E. 28 .\n\nIn appellants' brief, pages 56-66, it is contended that chapter 261 of the Laws of 1926 repeals or amends chapter 189 of the Laws of 1924 so far as it imposes a tax upon domestic insurance companies and that, therefore, the Act of 1924 becomes discriminatory against foreign insurance companies and is in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. In answer to this contention the appellee says: That chapter 261 of the laws of 1926 does not repeal the tax imposed upon domestic companies by Chapter 189 of the Laws of 1924.\n\n Greenville Ice  Coal Co.  v.  City of Greenville,   69 Miss. 866 , 10 So. 574;  Curry-Finch Brick  Lumber Co.  v.  Miller,  123 Miss. 850 , 86 So. 579;  Ashcher  Baxter  v.  Edward Moyse   Co.,   101 Miss. 36 , 57 So. 299;  Darnell  v., 63 L.Ed. 1125.\n\nIn the case of  Adams  v.  Standard Oil Co.,   97 Miss. 879 , 53 So. 692, it was held that where an exemption from taxation is based upon a purely artificial distinction, and in violation of the equality clause of the Federal Constitution, the courts will not invalidate the entire privilege statute, from the effect of which such exemption is sought to be made, but the tax will be imposed upon the attempted exemption as well as upon the other taxpayer complaining that he has been denied equality of treatment. This case is a conclusive authority on the point that the exemption, which it is claimed exists by reason of the Act of 1926, will be stricken down and that the Act of 1924 will impose a tax on all of the class according to the fact of the statute.\n\n Johnson  v.  Long Furniture Co.,   113 Miss. 373 , 74 So. 283; Truas  v.  Corrigan,   257 U.S. 312 , 66 L.Ed. 254.\n\nIn the present case, if the statute of 1926 creates an invalid discrimination that statute will be ineffective insofar as it has that effect, and the original statute, which is not discriminatory as written, will remain the law.\n\nThis court has held that a municipality in maintaining and operating its fire department is exercising a governmental function and not a private function.  Alexander  v.  Vicksburg,  68 Miss. 564 , 10 So. 62;  Hattiesburg  v.  Geigor,   118 Miss. 676 , 79 So. 846. If a fire department is an exercise of the governmental function, moneys appropriated or used for its support are dedicated to a public purpose.\n\nArgued orally by  W.H. Watkins  and  J.M. Talbot,  for appellant, and  F.J. Lotterhos,  for appellee.",
