John R.\n\nBovery, Jr. (Bovery) organized sports pools for approximately\n\ntwenty years before he came under scrutiny by investigators.                      In\n\nSeptember 2010, the State obtained an order                     to restrain and\n\nseize the contents of three bank accounts at Amboy National Bank\n\nand   a   search    warrant   for   Bovery's      residence.      Approximately\n\n$846,000 was seized following execution of the order, search\n\nwarrant    and     Bovery's   arrest.       In   challenging     the    forfeiture\n\naction,    Bovery     admitted   operating       the   sports   pools    and    that\n\n$722,000    of     the   money   seized     represented     \"entry      fees\"     he\n\nreceived from players but denied the pools were illegal.\n\n      Bovery and his wife, Mary Bovery (collectively, claimants),\n\nappeal from orders that granted the State's motion for summary\n\n\n\n\n                                        2                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fjudgment     affirming      the    seizure,   and    denied     their   motion   to\n\nsegregate players' money.1           We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n       The facts are largely undisputed.             Bovery became the target\n\nof a criminal investigation after admitting his activities to\n\ndetectives of the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office in May\n\n2010.    Primarily, Bovery organized football survival pools but\n\nhe also organized baseball, golf, and basketball pools.                        There\n\nwere from one hundred to several thousand participants in the\n\npools who paid entry fees ranging from $20 to $100.                     During the\n\n2009    to   2010   \"pool    cycle,\"    Bovery      collected    just   over   $1.7\n\nmillion in pool entry fees.\n\n       Initially, Bovery deposited the entry fees into his own\n\nbank    accounts.      As    the    operation    grew,   Bovery    opened      joint\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Claimants' case information statement identifies the denial of\ntheir motion for reconsideration as an issue raised on appeal.\nHowever, this issue was addressed for the first time in their\nreply brief. Because this issue was not presented in claimants'\nmerits brief, it is deemed waived. See Gormley v. Wood-El, 218\nN.J. 72, 95 n.8 (2014); Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP v. N.J. Dept.\nof Law & Public Safety, 421 N.J. Super. 489, 496 n.5 (App. Div.\n2011) (claims not addressed in merits brief deemed abandoned,\nand could not properly be raised in a reply brief); see also\nPressler and Verniero, Current N.J. Court Rules, comment 4 on R.\n2:6-2 (2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                         3                                A-0703-14T2\n\faccounts with his father2 because he believed his children would\n\nbe unable to obtain financial aid for college if he had to\n\ndisclose the value of his pool-related assets.                    Bovery testified\n\nhe always put the entry fees into the two accounts he held\n\njointly with his father because he \"didn't want any lunatic to\n\nthink [he] had cash under the mattress.\"\n\n      Bovery stated the money he obtained from running the pools\n\nwas   \"the    money    I     live     on       now       actually,\"    amounting    to\n\napproximately $110,000 per year.                     He described the funds he\n\nreceived     from   pool   participants          as      \"'optional'    gifts, . . .\n\nsometimes from the winners and sometimes from the players in\n\ngeneral.\"     He emphasized that these gifts were \"always at the\n\ndiscretion of the players and/or winners.\"\n\n      In   2009,    Bovery    began    using         a    third-party    website    to\n\norganize the pools.          On his own website, he discussed at some\n\nlength the topic of gift pledges and how players were to make\n\nsuch pledges.       In one posting from August 2009,3 he described\n\nchanges he made to the procedures and explained he imposed a 10%\n\n\n2\n   Bovery's father was not involved in the sports pools and had\nrequested that his name be removed from the bank accounts.   He\nwas dismissed from the case by consent order in April 2014.\n3\n   In a posting from August 2010, Bovery referred players to this\nAugust 2009 post and one from August 2007 to describe the manner\nin which he operated the pools.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fmaximum   on    the    gifts    he       would   accept.4         He    noted,\n\n\"[h]istorically, the winners of my pools have been very generous\n\nwith their gifts to me and my family and I have no complaints;\n\nif I did, I would have stopped running these pools years ago.\"\n\nHe said he had \"just 4 problems over 19 years who gifted less\n\nthan 10%.\"     After instructing players on how to fill in the\n\nfields on the website to make their pledges, he stated, \"if you\n\nput a number lower than 10[%] it will be your way of showing me\n\nthat you do not share my view on compensating pool managers.\"\n\nHe also told players that if they disagreed with gifting him\n\n10%, \"I strongly suggest you not participate in any of my pools,\n\nit will simply help us both to avoid a very ugly situation\n\nsomewhere down the road.\"        In an email, Bovery described his\n\ncontingency plan for dealing with winners who failed to \"gift\"\n\nthe 10%, that he would advise them they would receive a 1099,\n\nwhich would result in their winnings being taxed.\n\n    Bovery did not report the \"gifts\" he received as income to\n\nfederal   or   state   taxing   authorities      during     the   decades     he\n\n\n\n\n4\n    During the course of his testimony, Bovery stated that he\n\"understood the ten percent\" from growing up in Jersey City,\nwhere he knew \"which shoemaker or which butcher was taking the\nnumbers.\"   He said, \"That's the way I grew up.   I understood\nbookkeeping, betting.   I understood how it worked, right, you\nknow and take care of people with ten percent.\"\n\n\n\n                                     5                                 A-0703-14T2\n\foperated the pools and did not report any of the payments made\n\nto pool winners to state or federal taxing authorities.\n\n     After the detectives' initial interviews, two of the bank\n\naccounts were subpoenaed and periodically checked.                     The accounts\n\nwere seized on the first day of the football season before the\n\nstart   of   any     game.    A    detective   testified        the    prosecutor's\n\noffice waited to obtain and execute the search warrants because\n\nthey \"wanted to have as much evidence as possible.\"\n\n     Accounts       number   XXX-XXXX-2     (Account      -2)    and     XXX-XXXX-4\n\n(Account -4) were joint accounts in the names of Bovery and his\n\nfather.      Account number XXX-XXXX-5 (Account -5) was a joint\n\naccount with Bovery's wife.           According to Bovery, \"[a]ll [three]\n\naccounts     were     used    to    varying     degrees     for        pool-related\n\npurposes.\"     Account -2 and Account -4 were \"primarily used for\n\npool-related purposes,\" while Account -5 was \"primarily used for\n\npersonal purposes.\"\n\n     The deadlines for pool participants to remit entry fees to\n\nparticipate     in    his    sports   pools     for   the   2010/11           National\n\nFootball League season ranged from September 4 to 19, 2010.                          It\n\nis   undisputed5      that   in    August     and   September         2010,    Bovery\n\n\n5\n    The facts regarding these deposits were set forth in the\nStatement of Undisputed Facts submitted by the State in support\nof its motion for summary judgment and were not disputed by\nclaimants pursuant to Rule 4:46-2(b).\n\n\n\n                                        6                                     A-0703-14T2\n\fdeposited checks and money orders payable to him as entry fees\n\nand totaling over $617,000 as follows:\n\n    Deposits to Account -2\n\n    8/24/10   $28,205\n              $28,765\n              $18,345\n\n    8/25/10   $28,350\n              $22,240\n\n    8/26/10   $17,420\n\n    8/27/10   $27,955\n\n    8/30/10   $36,220\n\n    9/7/10    $36,800\n              $47,190\n              $43,165\n\n    Deposits to Account -4\n\n    8/24/10   $22,210\n              $32,275\n              $16,800\n\n    8/25/10   $21,930\n              $39,255\n\n    8/26/10   $18,640\n              $25,535\n\n    8/30/10   $27,985\n\n    9/7/10    $29,630\n              $48,105 (96 checks and money orders)\n\n    At the time of the seizure the accounts from which the\n\nmoney was seized were the only bank accounts held by claimants.\n\nAs Bovery admitted, Account -5 was also used for the deposit of\n\n\n\n\n                               7                       A-0703-14T2\n\fentry fees, although to a lesser degree.             By way of example, he\n\ntestified that eight checks totaling $1500 deposited into that\n\naccount in February 2009 were entry fees from \"late payers.\"\n\n       When   the   warrants    were   executed    on   September   9,     2010,\n\n$837,194.14 was seized from the bank accounts: $436,845.86 from\n\nAccount -2; $382,398.14 from Account -4; and $17,950.14 from\n\nAccount -5.      In addition, $8510 in cash was seized from Bovery's\n\nhome and $335 was seized from Bovery's wallet incident to his\n\narrest.       It is undisputed that the cash seized from Bovery's\n\nhome was withdrawn from Account -5.               Of the $846,000 seized,\n\nplayers' entry fees accounted for $722,000; $124,000 were the\n\nBoverys' personal funds.\n\n       On October 20, 2010, the State commenced an action pursuant\n\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1 for forfeiture of the contents of the three\n\nbank   accounts     as   well   as   the   cash   seized   from   the    Bovery\n\nresidence, alleging that all the money was used or intended to\n\nbe used in the commission of criminal activity.6             Claimants were\n\nserved with copies of the verified complaint.\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Bovery was indicted for: third-degree promotion of gambling,\nN.J.S.A. 2C:37-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:2-6; and first-degree financial\nfacilitation of a crime, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-25 and N.J.S.A. 2C:2-6.\nA motion to dismiss the indictment was denied in February 2012.\nAccording to Promis/Gavel, Bovery was subsequently admitted to\nthe pretrial intervention program.\n\n\n\n\n                                       8                                A-0703-14T2\n\f       Claimants       moved   to    separate      player    money,     arguing       the\n\nState's failure to notify any players of the seizure violated\n\nthe notice provision of the forfeiture statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n3(c),    and    therefore,       the     players'    money     should      have     been\n\nseparated      from     Bovery's       personal     money.         Following        oral\n\nargument, the trial judge denied claimants' motion, citing a\n\nlack of standing.7\n\n       The State moved for summary judgment, contending the funds\n\nseized were subject to forfeiture pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n1(a)    because    Bovery      illegally     operated    and   accepted         proceeds\n\nfrom various sports pools.                Claimants cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment.      Claimants did not deny Bovery's role in the pool\n\norganization      or    that    he     accepted    remuneration       from      players.\n\nThey argued the seized money was not used in furtherance of\n\nunlawful activity because the pools did not constitute illegal\n\ngambling.      The trial judge granted the State's motion and denied\n\nclaimants'     motion,      setting      forth     his   reasons      in    a    written\n\nopinion.    Claimants' motion for reconsideration was denied.\n\n       In their appeal, claimants argue the trial judge erred in\n\ngranting    summary       judgment      to   the    State    because       there    were\n\n\n7\n   No written order memorializing the oral decision is included\nin the record on appeal, and claimants state \"[u]pon information\nand belief, no written [o]rder was prepared denying the\n[m]otion.\"\n\n\n\n                                             9                                  A-0703-14T2\n\fmaterial issues of fact (Point I).                       Specifically, as to the\n\n$124,000 described as Bovery's personal funds, claimants argue\n\nthat a material issue of fact existed because in determining\n\nthese funds were subject to forfeiture, the trial court failed\n\nto account for W-2 money deposited into the account.                            Claimants\n\nfurther argue a material issue of fact barred summary judgment\n\nbecause    the     State      failed    to     establish       the     requirements     of\n\nN.J.S.A.        2C:37-2(b)(1).              Claimants     also       contend     Bovery's\n\nacceptance       of    \"gifts\"    from       the    players      did    not    amount    to\n\naccepting       bets   from    them    and     that    the    trial    court    erred   in\n\nholding Bovery materially aided an unlawful gambling enterprise\n\nbecause he never accepted a bet.                     Claimants argue further that\n\nthe trial court erred in \"ruling the State's seizure of player\n\nmoney     did    not    violate       the     notice    provision       of     the   civil\n\nforfeiture       statute\"      (Point        II).       Finally,       claimants     argue\n\nsummary    judgment        should      not    have     been    granted       because    the\n\nseizure of accounts here exemplifies the potential for abuse in\n\nthe forfeiture statute.

Accordingly, a civil forfeiture action is brought as\n\nan in rem proceeding against the property rather than as an\n\naction against the owner of the property.             Id. at 232-33.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12                              A-0703-14T2\n\f       N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1 to -9 authorizes civil forfeiture for two\n\ncategories of property.\n\n       The first category is designated prima facie contraband and\n\nconsists of \"[c]ontrolled dangerous substances, firearms which\n\nare unlawfully possessed, carried, acquired or used, illegally\n\npossessed gambling devices, untaxed . . . cigarettes . . . [and]\n\nuntaxed special fuel.\"                N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(1).              Prima facie\n\ncontraband is automatically forfeited once seized by the State.\n\nSeven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 233 (citing N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:64-2).\n\n       The money seized here falls into the second category of\n\nproperty,    known    as    derivative       or   non-prima       facie    contraband.\n\nThe    property     seized       is    innocent        and   is   only     subject    to\n\nforfeiture    as     a     result      of   its    association       with     unlawful\n\nactivity.          Ibid.         The    statute        authorizes    forfeiture       of\n\n\"[p]roperty    which       has    become     or    is    intended     to    become    an\n\nintegral part of illegal activity, including, but not limited\n\nto, money which is earmarked for use as financing for an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise.\"            N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(3).            Unlike the first\n\ncategory of property, the forfeiture of this property is not\n\naccomplished upon seizure.              To enforce forfeiture of derivative\n\ncontraband, \"the State must bring a civil action within ninety\n\ndays    of   the     seizure      against        the    property     sought     to    be\n\n\n\n\n                                            13                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fforfeited,\"       Seven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 233\n\n(citing    N.J.S.A.        2C:64-3(a)),           and     prove    a   direct,    causal\n\nconnection between the seized property and the unlawful activity\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.                     Id. at 234-35.\n\n    The     court        then    conducts         a     fact-specific       analysis     to\n\ndetermine whether the State has established a direct, causal\n\nconnection between the seized property and unlawful activity by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.

Bovery's\n\nadmissions regarding his past activity and what was planned for\n\nthe money seized from the bank accounts provide the required\n\nconnection    to     the   offense   of    promoting         gambling       under    both\n\nsubsections.\n\n      First, it is undisputed that Bovery received entry fees\n\nfrom the players and \"sometimes received optional gifts from the\n\nparticipants of the pools\" of approximately ten percent of the\n\nentry fees or winnings.           He received the money pursuant to an\n\nagreement with the players that he would pool the funds received\n\nand     distribute     winnings      according         to      the    procedures      he\n\nidentified on his website.              These admitted acts amounted to\n\nparticipation in the proceeds of gambling activity, in violation\n\n\n\n\n                                          18                                   A-0703-14T2\n\fof N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(a)(1).           Bovery's contention that the gifts\n\nwere \"optional\" does not immunize his conduct. In determining\n\nwhether conduct constitutes promotion of gambling, \"it matters\n\nnot    whether    [a    defendant]   was       compensated         by    a    stipulated\n\npercentage of the wager, or whether he received . . . 'voluntary\n\ncontributions' from the players.\"              Chomatopoulos v. Roma DeNotte\n\nSoc. Club, 212 N.J. Super. 447, 450 (Law Div. 1985).\n\n       Second, it is undisputed that Bovery organized a number of\n\ndifferent types of sports survival pools using both his own\n\nwebsite and a third-party website.               He induced participation in\n\nhis pools by posting messages on his website and by sending\n\nemails   to    prospective     participants.          This    conduct         materially\n\naided the sports pool, a form of gambling activity, in violation\n\nof N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(a)(2).\n\n       The next question is whether Bovery's activities rose to\n\nthe    level     of    an   indictable    offense.           N.J.S.A.         2C:37-2(b)\n\nestablishes the grading for this offense.                   Promoting gambling is\n\na disorderly persons offense unless certain criteria are met.\n\nBy    \"[e]ngaging      in   bookmaking    to    the       extent    he       receives   or\n\naccepts in any one day more than five bets totaling more than\n\n$1,000.00,\"      a    person   is   guilty      of    a    third-degree         offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19                                      A-0703-14T2\n\fN.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(b)(1).8          One who \"engag[es] in bookmaking to the\n\nextent he receives or accepts three or more bets in any two-week\n\nperiod\" is guilty of a fourth-degree offense.                        N.J.S.A. 2C:37-\n\n2(b).      Bookmaking is defined as \"advancing gambling activity by\n\nunlawfully accepting bets[9] from members of the public upon the\n\noutcome of future contingent events as a business.\"                         N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:37-1(g).\n\n      Claimants argue that Bovery \"did not accept a bet because\n\nhe   had    no   financial    stake   in       the   outcome    of    any   pools     he\n\nmanaged.\"        This argument seeks to superimpose a requirement not\n\npresent in the plain language of the statute — that to be guilty\n\nof promoting gambling, one must have a personal stake in whether\n\na specific bet wins or loses.          We reject this argument.\n\n      Claimants      cite    no    legal       authority       to    support      their\n\ninterpretation       and,    in   fact,    the       factual    premise     for      the\n\nargument is substantially undermined by Bovery's testimony that\n\n\n8\n    N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(b)(2) provides an alternative basis for\npromoting gambling to constitute a third-degree offense that is\ninapplicable here.\n9\n   Because \"bet\" is not defined in the statute, we give the word\nits \"ordinary meaning and significance.\"     State v.

Black's Law Dictionary\ndefines a bet as \"[s]omething of value (esp. money) staked or\npledged as a wager,\" Black's Law Dictionary 144 (9th ed. 2010),\nand wager as \"[m]oney or other consideration risked on an\nuncertain event.\" Id. at 1355.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20                                   A-0703-14T2\n\fhe accepted responsibility for covering the bets or entry fees\n\nfor persons who did not pay them.               He stated he lost $3000 to\n\n$5000 per year in collections because it was not his practice to\n\nreduce the pot won by the amount of the entry fees players\n\nfailed to pay; that he would \"eat the losses\" and write off\n\n\"deadbeats.\"10\n\n     Alternatively, claimants seek to define a bet as \"where a\n\nplayer selected what they believed would be a winning team\" and\n\nargue    that   here,     because    the   money    was    seized         prior   to    the\n\ncommencement      of    the   football     season    –    no       bets   had   yet    been\n\nplaced.    Claimants maintain that \"for a bet to take place, an\n\namount must be staked on a particular outcome and the player\n\nmust also select a side of an event.\"                    According to claimants,\n\nat the time the funds were seized, players had either not chosen\n\na team, had chosen a team but could change their team choice, or\n\ncould \"decide not to play and request and receive a refund.\"\n\nThis argument also fails to create a factual issue that will\n\nwithstand summary judgment.\n\n     As    we   have     noted,     to   establish       the       required     nexus    to\n\nillegal activity, the State does not have to establish that the\n\nseized    funds        constitute    evidence       that       a     crime      has    been\n\n10\n    A balance sheet seized from claimants' residence during the\nexecution of the search warrant included an entry for \"deadbeats\ncushion\" of $4000.\n\n\n\n                                           21                                     A-0703-14T2\n\fcommitted.         The connection to illegal activity may be satisfied\n\nby showing the funds' relationship to prior offenses or activity\n\nthat is planned and never comes to fruition.                           Seven Thousand\n\nDollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 234.                    Proof that the money seized\n\nwas \"intended to become an integral part of . . . an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise\" was sufficient.                  N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(3).\n\n      That standard was met here.                    The identification of over\n\n$700,000 of the money seized as the entry fees for the 2010\n\nfootball pool provided ample proof of a connection to an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise and Bovery's admissions regarding his prior,\n\nlongstanding         involvement       in     sports         pools     provided     that\n\nconnection for the seized funds that were described as personal.\n\n      The record provides ample proof that the promoting gambling\n\nconduct here rose to the level of an indictable offense.                          During\n\nthe   2009    to     2010    \"pool    cycle,\"       Bovery    collected    over     $1.7\n\nmillion in pool entry fees ranging from $20 to $100.                          By way of\n\nexample, on September 7, 2010, Bovery made three deposits of\n\n$36,800,     $47,190      and   $43,165      into     Account    -2.      The   $36,800\n\ndeposit consisted of eleven checks or money orders representing\n\nplayer \"entry fees.\"            On the same date, he made two deposits to\n\nAccount      -4,     of     $29,630    and        $48,105,    the    latter     deposit\n\nconsisting of ninety-six checks and money orders.                         These entry\n\nfees constituted the \"something of value\" each player \"stak[ed]\n\n\n\n\n                                             22                                 A-0703-14T2\n\for risk[ed] . . . upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a\n\nfuture      contingent      event      not   under       the    actor's      control       or\n\ninfluence,\" within the definition of gambling in N.J.S.A. 2C:37-\n\n1(b).        These     admitted     transactions         are    ample     proof      of    an\n\nindictable offense.\n\n       We therefore conclude the State met its initial burden of\n\nproving by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a\n\ndirect      causal     connection       between     the     seized      funds       and    an\n\nindictable offense.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We    next    turn   to   whether     the    court      erred    in     failing     to\n\nallocate the funds between illegal and legal purposes.                                As we\n\nhave noted, forfeiture will be limited to those funds connected\n\nwith the illegal activity \"[i]f the owner presents sufficient\n\ncredible      evidence      to   allocate     the    funds      between      illegal      and\n\nlegal purposes.\"            Seven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at\n\n238.     The record includes a copy of claimants' W-2s for 2010,\n\nwhich       report     income     of     approximately         $47,000       from      their\n\nemployment.          Claimants argue the State was required to conduct\n\n\"a forensic accounting of the entire $846,000 going in and out\n\nof these accounts\" to segregate the funds obtained through their\n\nemployment.          However, it was claimants' burden to present this\n\nargument      and     supporting       evidence     if   they    were     to    withstand\n\n\n\n\n                                             23                                     A-0703-14T2\n\fsummary judgment.           Once the State made the initial requisite\n\nshowing, the burden shifted to claimants \"to show what portion\n\nof the money, if any, the court should ascribe to legitimate\n\nuses.\"      Ibid.        They failed to do so and did not raise this\n\nargument until they filed their motion for reconsideration.\n\n      As    the     State      argues,    claimants    did    not    dispute      that\n\nBovery's bank records and deposition testimony reveal that from\n\nOctober 5, 2009 through January 4, 2010, he transferred at least\n\n$43,679    of     proceeds      or   \"gifts\"    from   his   sports     pools     from\n\nAccount -2 and Account -4 to the \"personal account.\"                       The State\n\nreasons that because the amount in claimants' \"personal\" account\n\nat   the   time     of   the    seizure,    $17,950.14,      was    less   than   the\n\n$43,679 in pool proceeds Bovery transferred into that account,\n\nclaimants are foreclosed from arguing that any of the $17,950.14\n\nseized constituted legitimate W-2 income, not linked to illegal\n\nactivity.       Therefore, it is argued, the seizure of the contents\n\nof the entire account was proper.                 See State v. Sparano, 249\n\nN.J. Super. 411, 427 (App. Div. 1991) (\"[T]here need not be a\n\n'direct'     connection         between     racketeering      profits      and    the\n\nacquired property sought to be forfeited, so long as the State\n\nproves that the property was acquired by funds equivalent to the\n\nfruits of the criminal activity.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                           24                               A-0703-14T2\n\f       Our review of the record reveals that claimants failed to\n\npresent a genuine issue of fact that an identifiable amount of\n\nthe    money    seized      was    attributable      to    a    legitimate    source.\n\nPursuant to Rule 4:46-2(a), the State prepared a Statement of\n\nUndisputed Facts in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n\nAs required by the rule, the state's factual assertions were\n\nsupported by citations to the record, which included Bovery's\n\ntestimony,          claimants'          discovery        responses      and      other\n\ndocumentation.\n\n       Paragraph      155    asserted      that    all    the   funds   retained     in\n\nAccount -2 and Account -4 \"represent[ed] either funds collected\n\nby [Bovery] as entry fees . . . or funds received/retained by\n\n[Bovery]       in   the     form   of    'gifts'    from    pools    participants.\"\n\nBecause claimants offered no response to this paragraph, the\n\nfacts contained therein were deemed admitted pursuant to Rule\n\n4:46-2(b).\n\n       Paragraph 189 asserted that \"at least $43,679\" in sports\n\npool   \"gifts\"      was     transferred     from    the    \"pool\"    accounts     into\n\nclaimants' \"personal\" account.               Claimants also failed to refute\n\nthe facts contained in this paragraph, thereby admitting the\n\nassertions pursuant to Rule 4:46-2(b).\n\n       Claimants also presented no response to paragraphs in the\n\nState's Statement of Undisputed Facts that asserted checks from\n\n\n\n\n                                           25                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fAccount -2 and Account -4, the accounts used primarily for the\n\npools,     were    used    to     pay    personal      expenses        such    as   their\n\nmortgage, their daughters' college tuition and Bovery's credit\n\ncard,    that     checks   were    drawn       made    payable    to    \"cash\"      or   to\n\nBovery, and at least one check drawn on a \"pool\" account was\n\ndeposited into Account -5.\n\n      Paragraph 186 of the State's Statement of Undisputed Facts\n\nasserts that at the time of seizure, Account -2 and Account -4\n\nheld \"$760,055 in funds derived as entry fees collected from\n\npool participants.\"         Paragraph 189 asserted Bovery's \"records,\n\nprior statements, and sworn testimony and admissions discussed\n\nsupra show that [Bovery] also transferred at least $43,679 of\n\nthe 'gifts' . . . from Accounts Nos. []-2 and []-4 into Account\n\nNo. []-5, the account [Bovery] held jointly with\" Mary Bovery.\n\n      Claimants      offered      no    response      to   Paragraph     189    and,     in\n\nresponse    to    Paragraph     186,     merely       supported    their      denial     by\n\nsaying,    \"The    calculations         are    incorrect.        See    balance     sheet\n\nattached to the State's Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit\n\n3.\"     That \"balance sheet,\" bearing a date of August 21, 2010,\n\nwas seized from claimants' home pursuant to the search warrant\n\nand appears to be prepared by Bovery.                      It lists the assets in\n\n\"our checking\" as $19,452.27 and \"john pay 10/11 school year\n\npending bank deposit\" as $1200.\n\n\n\n\n                                              26                                 A-0703-14T2\n\f     In short, claimants' responses to the State's Statement of\n\nUndisputed Facts were inadequate to create a genuine issue of\n\nfact, see R. 4:46-2(b), much less satisfy claimants' burden to\n\npresent   \"sufficient   credible   evidence      to    allocate    the    funds\n\nbetween illegal and legal purposes.\"             Seven Thousand Dollars,\n\nsupra, 136 N.J. at 238.\n\n                                   VI.\n\n     In Point II, claimants argue the State violated the notice\n\nprovision    of   N.J.S.A.   2C:64-3   because    it    failed    to   provide\n\nnotice to the players whose entry fees were seized and that, as\n\na result, the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.                 They\n\nargue the players had an affirmative defense to the forfeiture\n\nof their funds because N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(c) excludes players from\n\nprosecution for promoting gambling.        They contend that, because\n\nthe players committed no crime, the seizure of the money they\n\npaid as entry fees \"violates notions of fundamental fairness.\"\n\nThis argument merits only limited comment.            R. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).11\n\n     The State was required to provide notice of the forfeiture\n\naction \"to any person known to have a property interest in the\"\n\nproperty sought to be forfeited.         N.J.S.A. 2C:64-3(c) (emphasis\n\nadded).     The persons known to have a property interest in the\n\n\n11\n    We therefore need not address the standing issue raised by\nthe State and decided by the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                   27                                  A-0703-14T2\n\faccounts that were seized were the account holders: Bovery, his\n\nwife and his father.           Each was given notice.         The entry fees\n\nwere not segregated into separate accounts for each player; no\n\nplayer was an account holder.             Therefore, the notice provided by\n\nthe State adequately complied with the statutory provision.\n\n      We     note    further   that   claimants'   argument    rests    upon    a\n\nfaulty premise — that the State's right to forfeiture depends\n\nupon the players' guilt of an offense.                 As we have noted, a\n\nforfeiture action is brought against the property itself, and\n\nnot its owner or possessor because the theory of forfeiture is\n\nbased   on    \"the    misuse   of   the   property.\"    See   Seven    Thousand\n\nDollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 232-33 (citation omitted).                    Civil\n\nforfeiture is permitted for property that is intended to become\n\npart of illegal activity and requires neither criminal conduct\n\nnor a conviction.         See id. at 234.12      The fact that the players\n\ncommitted no crime is therefore of no import.                 See id. at 233-\n\n34.\n\n12\n   In interpreting a prior forfeiture statute, the Supreme Court\nstated \"all property used for gambling was contraband, and such\nproperty was construed to include all money earmarked and\nsegregated as part of a gambling operation.\"       Spagnuolo v.\nBonnet, 16 N.J. 546, 558 (1954). The Court stated further that\nthe statute \"could not be intended to have the effect of leaving\nthe legal title to such money in the gambler or player.\" Ibid.\nClaimants contend the trial court's reliance upon Spagnuolo was\nflawed because the earlier statute did not include a notice\nprovision like that in the present statute. We are unpersuaded\nby this argument.\n\n\n\n                                          28                           A-0703-14T2\n\f       Even if the players could be considered owners of the funds\n\nheld in the accounts under others' names, the players' defense\n\nto the criminal offense does not equate with a defense to the\n\nforfeiture of the funds they paid to Bovery.                     N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n5(b)    provides      an    \"innocent    owner\"    defense      and   states    that\n\nproperty seized pursuant to the civil forfeiture statute will\n\nnot    be   subject    to   forfeiture    \"if     the   owner    of   the   property\n\nestablishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner\n\nwas not involved in or aware of the unlawful activity and that\n\nthe owner had done all that could reasonably be expected to\n\nprevent the proscribed use of the property by an agent.\"                           See\n\nalso State v.

It\n\nis    beyond   cavil       that   the   players    who    paid    entry     fees   to\n\nparticipate in Bovery's sports pools were aware of the unlawful\n\nactivity that provided the basis for forfeiture.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29                                 A-0703-14T2\n\f",

In\n\nSeptember 2010, the State obtained an order                     to restrain and\n\nseize the contents of three bank accounts at Amboy National Bank\n\nand   a   search    warrant   for   Bovery's      residence.

In   challenging     the    forfeiture\n\naction,    Bovery     admitted   operating       the   sports   pools    and    that\n\n$722,000    of     the   money   seized     represented     \"entry      fees\"     he\n\nreceived from players but denied the pools were illegal.\n\n      Bovery and his wife, Mary Bovery (collectively, claimants),\n\nappeal from orders that granted the State's motion for summary\n\n\n\n\n                                        2                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fjudgment     affirming      the    seizure,   and    denied     their   motion   to\n\nsegregate players' money.1           We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n       The facts are largely undisputed.             Bovery became the target\n\nof a criminal investigation after admitting his activities to\n\ndetectives of the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office in May\n\n2010.    Primarily, Bovery organized football survival pools but\n\nhe also organized baseball, golf, and basketball pools.                        There\n\nwere from one hundred to several thousand participants in the\n\npools who paid entry fees ranging from $20 to $100.                     During the\n\n2009    to   2010   \"pool    cycle,\"    Bovery      collected    just   over   $1.7\n\nmillion in pool entry fees.\n\n       Initially, Bovery deposited the entry fees into his own\n\nbank    accounts.      As    the    operation    grew,   Bovery    opened      joint\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Claimants' case information statement identifies the denial of\ntheir motion for reconsideration as an issue raised on appeal.\nHowever, this issue was addressed for the first time in their\nreply brief.

Bovery testified\n\nhe always put the entry fees into the two accounts he held\n\njointly with his father because he \"didn't want any lunatic to\n\nthink [he] had cash under the mattress.\"\n\n      Bovery stated the money he obtained from running the pools\n\nwas   \"the    money    I     live     on       now       actually,\"    amounting    to\n\napproximately $110,000 per year.                     He described the funds he\n\nreceived     from   pool   participants          as      \"'optional'    gifts, . . .\n\nsometimes from the winners and sometimes from the players in\n\ngeneral.\"     He emphasized that these gifts were \"always at the\n\ndiscretion of the players and/or winners.\"\n\n      In   2009,    Bovery    began    using         a    third-party    website    to\n\norganize the pools.          On his own website, he discussed at some\n\nlength the topic of gift pledges and how players were to make\n\nsuch pledges.       In one posting from August 2009,3 he described\n\nchanges he made to the procedures and explained he imposed a 10%\n\n\n2\n   Bovery's father was not involved in the sports pools and had\nrequested that his name be removed from the bank accounts.   He\nwas dismissed from the case by consent order in April 2014.\n3\n   In a posting from August 2010, Bovery referred players to this\nAugust 2009 post and one from August 2007 to describe the manner\nin which he operated the pools.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fmaximum   on    the    gifts    he       would   accept.4         He    noted,\n\n\"[h]istorically, the winners of my pools have been very generous\n\nwith their gifts to me and my family and I have no complaints;\n\nif I did, I would have stopped running these pools years ago.\"\n\nHe said he had \"just 4 problems over 19 years who gifted less\n\nthan 10%.\"     After instructing players on how to fill in the\n\nfields on the website to make their pledges, he stated, \"if you\n\nput a number lower than 10[%] it will be your way of showing me\n\nthat you do not share my view on compensating pool managers.\"\n\nHe also told players that if they disagreed with gifting him\n\n10%, \"I strongly suggest you not participate in any of my pools,\n\nit will simply help us both to avoid a very ugly situation\n\nsomewhere down the road.\"        In an email, Bovery described his\n\ncontingency plan for dealing with winners who failed to \"gift\"\n\nthe 10%, that he would advise them they would receive a 1099,\n\nwhich would result in their winnings being taxed.\n\n    Bovery did not report the \"gifts\" he received as income to\n\nfederal   or   state   taxing   authorities      during     the   decades     he\n\n\n\n\n4\n    During the course of his testimony, Bovery stated that he\n\"understood the ten percent\" from growing up in Jersey City,\nwhere he knew \"which shoemaker or which butcher was taking the\nnumbers.\"   He said, \"That's the way I grew up.   I understood\nbookkeeping, betting.   I understood how it worked, right, you\nknow and take care of people with ten percent.\"\n\n\n\n                                     5                                 A-0703-14T2\n\foperated the pools and did not report any of the payments made\n\nto pool winners to state or federal taxing authorities.\n\n     After the detectives' initial interviews, two of the bank\n\naccounts were subpoenaed and periodically checked.                     The accounts\n\nwere seized on the first day of the football season before the\n\nstart   of   any     game.    A    detective   testified        the    prosecutor's\n\noffice waited to obtain and execute the search warrants because\n\nthey \"wanted to have as much evidence as possible.\"\n\n     Accounts       number   XXX-XXXX-2     (Account      -2)    and     XXX-XXXX-4\n\n(Account -4) were joint accounts in the names of Bovery and his\n\nfather.      Account number XXX-XXXX-5 (Account -5) was a joint\n\naccount with Bovery's wife.           According to Bovery, \"[a]ll [three]\n\naccounts     were     used    to    varying     degrees     for        pool-related\n\npurposes.\"     Account -2 and Account -4 were \"primarily used for\n\npool-related purposes,\" while Account -5 was \"primarily used for\n\npersonal purposes.\"\n\n     The deadlines for pool participants to remit entry fees to\n\nparticipate     in    his    sports   pools     for   the   2010/11           National\n\nFootball League season ranged from September 4 to 19, 2010.

By way of example, he\n\ntestified that eight checks totaling $1500 deposited into that\n\naccount in February 2009 were entry fees from \"late payers.\"\n\n       When   the   warrants    were   executed    on   September   9,     2010,\n\n$837,194.14 was seized from the bank accounts: $436,845.86 from\n\nAccount -2; $382,398.14 from Account -4; and $17,950.14 from\n\nAccount -5.      In addition, $8510 in cash was seized from Bovery's\n\nhome and $335 was seized from Bovery's wallet incident to his\n\narrest.       It is undisputed that the cash seized from Bovery's\n\nhome was withdrawn from Account -5.               Of the $846,000 seized,\n\nplayers' entry fees accounted for $722,000; $124,000 were the\n\nBoverys' personal funds.\n\n       On October 20, 2010, the State commenced an action pursuant\n\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1 for forfeiture of the contents of the three\n\nbank   accounts     as   well   as   the   cash   seized   from   the    Bovery\n\nresidence, alleging that all the money was used or intended to\n\nbe used in the commission of criminal activity.6             Claimants were\n\nserved with copies of the verified complaint.\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Bovery was indicted for: third-degree promotion of gambling,\nN.J.S.A. 2C:37-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:2-6; and first-degree financial\nfacilitation of a crime, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-25 and N.J.S.A. 2C:2-6.\nA motion to dismiss the indictment was denied in February 2012.\nAccording to Promis/Gavel, Bovery was subsequently admitted to\nthe pretrial intervention program.\n\n\n\n\n                                       8                                A-0703-14T2\n\f       Claimants       moved   to    separate      player    money,     arguing       the\n\nState's failure to notify any players of the seizure violated\n\nthe notice provision of the forfeiture statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n3(c),    and    therefore,       the     players'    money     should      have     been\n\nseparated      from     Bovery's       personal     money.         Following        oral\n\nargument, the trial judge denied claimants' motion, citing a\n\nlack of standing.7\n\n       The State moved for summary judgment, contending the funds\n\nseized were subject to forfeiture pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n1(a)    because    Bovery      illegally     operated    and   accepted         proceeds\n\nfrom various sports pools.                Claimants cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment.      Claimants did not deny Bovery's role in the pool\n\norganization      or    that    he     accepted    remuneration       from      players.\n\nThey argued the seized money was not used in furtherance of\n\nunlawful activity because the pools did not constitute illegal\n\ngambling.      The trial judge granted the State's motion and denied\n\nclaimants'     motion,      setting      forth     his   reasons      in    a    written\n\nopinion.    Claimants' motion for reconsideration was denied.\n\n       In their appeal, claimants argue the trial judge erred in\n\ngranting    summary       judgment      to   the    State    because       there    were\n\n\n7\n   No written order memorializing the oral decision is included\nin the record on appeal, and claimants state \"[u]pon information\nand belief, no written [o]rder was prepared denying the\n[m]otion.\"\n\n\n\n                                             9                                  A-0703-14T2\n\fmaterial issues of fact (Point I).                       Specifically, as to the\n\n$124,000 described as Bovery's personal funds, claimants argue\n\nthat a material issue of fact existed because in determining\n\nthese funds were subject to forfeiture, the trial court failed\n\nto account for W-2 money deposited into the account.                            Claimants\n\nfurther argue a material issue of fact barred summary judgment\n\nbecause    the     State      failed    to     establish       the     requirements     of\n\nN.J.S.A.        2C:37-2(b)(1).              Claimants     also       contend     Bovery's\n\nacceptance       of    \"gifts\"    from       the    players      did    not    amount    to\n\naccepting       bets   from    them    and     that    the    trial    court    erred   in\n\nholding Bovery materially aided an unlawful gambling enterprise\n\nbecause he never accepted a bet.                     Claimants argue further that\n\nthe trial court erred in \"ruling the State's seizure of player\n\nmoney     did    not    violate       the     notice    provision       of     the   civil\n\nforfeiture       statute\"      (Point        II).       Finally,       claimants     argue\n\nsummary    judgment        should      not    have     been    granted       because    the\n\nseizure of accounts here exemplifies the potential for abuse in\n\nthe forfeiture statute.                (Point III).           We are unpersuaded by\n\nthese arguments and, further, find the argument raised in Point\n\nIII lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written\n\nopinion.    R. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n\n\n\n\n                                              10                                 A-0703-14T2\n\f                                    II.\n\n       In reviewing the summary judgment order, we view the facts\n\n\"in the light most favorable to\" the claimants to determine \"if\n\nthere is a genuine issue as to any material fact or whether the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"               Rowe\n\nv.

Accordingly, a civil forfeiture action is brought as\n\nan in rem proceeding against the property rather than as an\n\naction against the owner of the property.

[and]\n\nuntaxed special fuel.\"                N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(1).              Prima facie\n\ncontraband is automatically forfeited once seized by the State.\n\nSeven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 233 (citing N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:64-2).\n\n       The money seized here falls into the second category of\n\nproperty,    known    as    derivative       or   non-prima       facie    contraband.\n\nThe    property     seized       is    innocent        and   is   only     subject    to\n\nforfeiture    as     a     result      of   its    association       with     unlawful\n\nactivity.          Ibid.         The    statute        authorizes    forfeiture       of\n\n\"[p]roperty    which       has    become     or    is    intended     to    become    an\n\nintegral part of illegal activity, including, but not limited\n\nto, money which is earmarked for use as financing for an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise.\"            N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(3).            Unlike the first\n\ncategory of property, the forfeiture of this property is not\n\naccomplished upon seizure.              To enforce forfeiture of derivative\n\ncontraband, \"the State must bring a civil action within ninety\n\ndays    of   the     seizure      against        the    property     sought     to    be\n\n\n\n\n                                            13                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fforfeited,\"       Seven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 233\n\n(citing    N.J.S.A.        2C:64-3(a)),           and     prove    a   direct,    causal\n\nconnection between the seized property and the unlawful activity\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.

Because these sports pools are a form of gambling\n\nthat is not sanctioned by the New Jersey Constitution, they are\n\nillegal.\n\n                                                B.\n\n      We next review the evidence to determine whether the State\n\nmet its initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that (1) there was a direct causal connection between\n\nthe   money    seized    and    the   promotion         of    gambling    and    (2)   the\n\npromotion of gambling involved constituted an indictable offense\n\nunder N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2.\n\n      N.J.S.A.     2C:37-2(a)         defines        the     offense     of     promoting\n\ngambling and states in pertinent part:\n\n              A person is guilty            of       promoting    gambling\n              when he knowingly:\n\n                   (1) Accepts or receives money or other\n              property,   pursuant  to   an  agreement or\n              understanding with any person whereby he\n              participates or will participate in the\n              proceeds of gambling activity; or\n\n\n\n\n                                           17                                    A-0703-14T2\n\f                 (2)    Engages     in     conduct,    which\n            materially   aids    any    form   of   gambling\n            activity.

Bovery's\n\nadmissions regarding his past activity and what was planned for\n\nthe money seized from the bank accounts provide the required\n\nconnection    to     the   offense   of    promoting         gambling       under    both\n\nsubsections.\n\n      First, it is undisputed that Bovery received entry fees\n\nfrom the players and \"sometimes received optional gifts from the\n\nparticipants of the pools\" of approximately ten percent of the\n\nentry fees or winnings.           He received the money pursuant to an\n\nagreement with the players that he would pool the funds received\n\nand     distribute     winnings      according         to      the    procedures      he\n\nidentified on his website.              These admitted acts amounted to\n\nparticipation in the proceeds of gambling activity, in violation\n\n\n\n\n                                          18                                   A-0703-14T2\n\fof N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(a)(1).           Bovery's contention that the gifts\n\nwere \"optional\" does not immunize his conduct. In determining\n\nwhether conduct constitutes promotion of gambling, \"it matters\n\nnot    whether    [a    defendant]   was       compensated         by    a    stipulated\n\npercentage of the wager, or whether he received . . . 'voluntary\n\ncontributions' from the players.\"              Chomatopoulos v. Roma DeNotte\n\nSoc.

He induced participation in\n\nhis pools by posting messages on his website and by sending\n\nemails   to    prospective     participants.          This    conduct         materially\n\naided the sports pool, a form of gambling activity, in violation\n\nof N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(a)(2).\n\n       The next question is whether Bovery's activities rose to\n\nthe    level     of    an   indictable    offense.           N.J.S.A.         2C:37-2(b)\n\nestablishes the grading for this offense.                   Promoting gambling is\n\na disorderly persons offense unless certain criteria are met.\n\nBy    \"[e]ngaging      in   bookmaking    to    the       extent    he       receives   or\n\naccepts in any one day more than five bets totaling more than\n\n$1,000.00,\"      a    person   is   guilty      of    a    third-degree         offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19                                      A-0703-14T2\n\fN.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(b)(1).8          One who \"engag[es] in bookmaking to the\n\nextent he receives or accepts three or more bets in any two-week\n\nperiod\" is guilty of a fourth-degree offense.                        N.J.S.A. 2C:37-\n\n2(b).      Bookmaking is defined as \"advancing gambling activity by\n\nunlawfully accepting bets[9] from members of the public upon the\n\noutcome of future contingent events as a business.\"                         N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:37-1(g).\n\n      Claimants argue that Bovery \"did not accept a bet because\n\nhe   had    no   financial    stake   in       the   outcome    of    any   pools     he\n\nmanaged.\"        This argument seeks to superimpose a requirement not\n\npresent in the plain language of the statute — that to be guilty\n\nof promoting gambling, one must have a personal stake in whether\n\na specific bet wins or loses.          We reject this argument.\n\n      Claimants      cite    no    legal       authority       to    support      their\n\ninterpretation       and,    in   fact,    the       factual    premise     for      the\n\nargument is substantially undermined by Bovery's testimony that\n\n\n8\n    N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(b)(2) provides an alternative basis for\npromoting gambling to constitute a third-degree offense that is\ninapplicable here.\n9\n   Because \"bet\" is not defined in the statute, we give the word\nits \"ordinary meaning and significance.\"     State v.

Claimants maintain that \"for a bet to take place, an\n\namount must be staked on a particular outcome and the player\n\nmust also select a side of an event.\"                    According to claimants,\n\nat the time the funds were seized, players had either not chosen\n\na team, had chosen a team but could change their team choice, or\n\ncould \"decide not to play and request and receive a refund.\"\n\nThis argument also fails to create a factual issue that will\n\nwithstand summary judgment.\n\n     As    we   have     noted,     to   establish       the       required     nexus    to\n\nillegal activity, the State does not have to establish that the\n\nseized    funds        constitute    evidence       that       a     crime      has    been\n\n10\n    A balance sheet seized from claimants' residence during the\nexecution of the search warrant included an entry for \"deadbeats\ncushion\" of $4000.\n\n\n\n                                           21                                     A-0703-14T2\n\fcommitted.         The connection to illegal activity may be satisfied\n\nby showing the funds' relationship to prior offenses or activity\n\nthat is planned and never comes to fruition.                           Seven Thousand\n\nDollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 234.                    Proof that the money seized\n\nwas \"intended to become an integral part of . . . an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise\" was sufficient.                  N.J.S.A. 2C:64-1(a)(3).\n\n      That standard was met here.                    The identification of over\n\n$700,000 of the money seized as the entry fees for the 2010\n\nfootball pool provided ample proof of a connection to an illegal\n\ngambling enterprise and Bovery's admissions regarding his prior,\n\nlongstanding         involvement       in     sports         pools     provided     that\n\nconnection for the seized funds that were described as personal.\n\n      The record provides ample proof that the promoting gambling\n\nconduct here rose to the level of an indictable offense.                          During\n\nthe   2009    to     2010    \"pool    cycle,\"       Bovery    collected    over     $1.7\n\nmillion in pool entry fees ranging from $20 to $100.                          By way of\n\nexample, on September 7, 2010, Bovery made three deposits of\n\n$36,800,     $47,190      and   $43,165      into     Account    -2.      The   $36,800\n\ndeposit consisted of eleven checks or money orders representing\n\nplayer \"entry fees.\"            On the same date, he made two deposits to\n\nAccount      -4,     of     $29,630    and        $48,105,    the    latter     deposit\n\nconsisting of ninety-six checks and money orders.                         These entry\n\nfees constituted the \"something of value\" each player \"stak[ed]\n\n\n\n\n                                             22                                 A-0703-14T2\n\for risk[ed] . . . upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a\n\nfuture      contingent      event      not   under       the    actor's      control       or\n\ninfluence,\" within the definition of gambling in N.J.S.A. 2C:37-\n\n1(b).        These     admitted     transactions         are    ample     proof      of    an\n\nindictable offense.\n\n       We therefore conclude the State met its initial burden of\n\nproving by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a\n\ndirect      causal     connection       between     the     seized      funds       and    an\n\nindictable offense.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We    next    turn   to   whether     the    court      erred    in     failing     to\n\nallocate the funds between illegal and legal purposes.                                As we\n\nhave noted, forfeiture will be limited to those funds connected\n\nwith the illegal activity \"[i]f the owner presents sufficient\n\ncredible      evidence      to   allocate     the    funds      between      illegal      and\n\nlegal purposes.\"            Seven Thousand Dollars, supra, 136 N.J. at\n\n238.     The record includes a copy of claimants' W-2s for 2010,\n\nwhich       report     income     of     approximately         $47,000       from      their\n\nemployment.          Claimants argue the State was required to conduct\n\n\"a forensic accounting of the entire $846,000 going in and out\n\nof these accounts\" to segregate the funds obtained through their\n\nemployment.          However, it was claimants' burden to present this\n\nargument      and     supporting       evidence     if   they    were     to    withstand\n\n\n\n\n                                             23                                     A-0703-14T2\n\fsummary judgment.           Once the State made the initial requisite\n\nshowing, the burden shifted to claimants \"to show what portion\n\nof the money, if any, the court should ascribe to legitimate\n\nuses.\"      Ibid.        They failed to do so and did not raise this\n\nargument until they filed their motion for reconsideration.\n\n      As    the     State      argues,    claimants    did    not    dispute      that\n\nBovery's bank records and deposition testimony reveal that from\n\nOctober 5, 2009 through January 4, 2010, he transferred at least\n\n$43,679    of     proceeds      or   \"gifts\"    from   his   sports     pools     from\n\nAccount -2 and Account -4 to the \"personal account.\"                       The State\n\nreasons that because the amount in claimants' \"personal\" account\n\nat   the   time     of   the    seizure,    $17,950.14,      was    less   than   the\n\n$43,679 in pool proceeds Bovery transferred into that account,\n\nclaimants are foreclosed from arguing that any of the $17,950.14\n\nseized constituted legitimate W-2 income, not linked to illegal\n\nactivity.       Therefore, it is argued, the seizure of the contents\n\nof the entire account was proper.                 See State v.

Claimants also failed to refute\n\nthe facts contained in this paragraph, thereby admitting the\n\nassertions pursuant to Rule 4:46-2(b).\n\n       Claimants also presented no response to paragraphs in the\n\nState's Statement of Undisputed Facts that asserted checks from\n\n\n\n\n                                           25                                 A-0703-14T2\n\fAccount -2 and Account -4, the accounts used primarily for the\n\npools,     were    used    to     pay    personal      expenses        such    as   their\n\nmortgage, their daughters' college tuition and Bovery's credit\n\ncard,    that     checks   were    drawn       made    payable    to    \"cash\"      or   to\n\nBovery, and at least one check drawn on a \"pool\" account was\n\ndeposited into Account -5.\n\n      Paragraph 186 of the State's Statement of Undisputed Facts\n\nasserts that at the time of seizure, Account -2 and Account -4\n\nheld \"$760,055 in funds derived as entry fees collected from\n\npool participants.\"         Paragraph 189 asserted Bovery's \"records,\n\nprior statements, and sworn testimony and admissions discussed\n\nsupra show that [Bovery] also transferred at least $43,679 of\n\nthe 'gifts' . . . from Accounts Nos.

They\n\nargue the players had an affirmative defense to the forfeiture\n\nof their funds because N.J.S.A. 2C:37-2(c) excludes players from\n\nprosecution for promoting gambling.        They contend that, because\n\nthe players committed no crime, the seizure of the money they\n\npaid as entry fees \"violates notions of fundamental fairness.\"\n\nThis argument merits only limited comment.            R. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).11\n\n     The State was required to provide notice of the forfeiture\n\naction \"to any person known to have a property interest in the\"\n\nproperty sought to be forfeited.         N.J.S.A. 2C:64-3(c) (emphasis\n\nadded).     The persons known to have a property interest in the\n\n\n11\n    We therefore need not address the standing issue raised by\nthe State and decided by the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                   27                                  A-0703-14T2\n\faccounts that were seized were the account holders: Bovery, his\n\nwife and his father.           Each was given notice.         The entry fees\n\nwere not segregated into separate accounts for each player; no\n\nplayer was an account holder.             Therefore, the notice provided by\n\nthe State adequately complied with the statutory provision.\n\n      We     note    further   that   claimants'   argument    rests    upon    a\n\nfaulty premise — that the State's right to forfeiture depends\n\nupon the players' guilt of an offense.                 As we have noted, a\n\nforfeiture action is brought against the property itself, and\n\nnot its owner or possessor because the theory of forfeiture is\n\nbased   on    \"the    misuse   of   the   property.\"    See   Seven    Thousand\n\nDollars, supra, 136 N.J. at 232-33 (citation omitted).                    Civil\n\nforfeiture is permitted for property that is intended to become\n\npart of illegal activity and requires neither criminal conduct\n\nnor a conviction.         See id. at 234.12      The fact that the players\n\ncommitted no crime is therefore of no import.                 See id. at 233-\n\n34.\n\n12\n   In interpreting a prior forfeiture statute, the Supreme Court\nstated \"all property used for gambling was contraband, and such\nproperty was construed to include all money earmarked and\nsegregated as part of a gambling operation.\"       Spagnuolo v.\nBonnet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2206192\"><a href=\"/opinion/2206192/spagnuolo-v-bonnet/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 558 (1954). The Court stated further that\nthe statute \"could not be intended to have the effect of leaving\nthe legal title to such money in the gambler or player.\" Ibid.\nClaimants contend the trial court's reliance upon Spagnuolo was\nflawed because the earlier statute did not include a notice\nprovision like that in the present statute. We are unpersuaded\nby this argument.\n\n\n\n                                          28                           A-0703-14T2\n\f       Even if the players could be considered owners of the funds\n\nheld in the accounts under others' names, the players' defense\n\nto the criminal offense does not equate with a defense to the\n\nforfeiture of the funds they paid to Bovery.                     N.J.S.A. 2C:64-\n\n5(b)    provides      an    \"innocent    owner\"    defense      and   states    that\n\nproperty seized pursuant to the civil forfeiture statute will\n\nnot    be   subject    to   forfeiture    \"if     the   owner    of   the   property\n\nestablishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner\n\nwas not involved in or aware of the unlawful activity and that\n\nthe owner had done all that could reasonably be expected to\n\nprevent the proscribed use of the property by an agent.\"                           See\n\nalso State v.
