KELSEY,\n                                        Appellant.\n\n\n                                 SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n\n1.\n       Appellate courts presume statutes are constitutional and must resolve all doubts in\nfavor of a statute's validity. Courts must interpret a statute in a way that makes the statute\nin question constitutional if there is any reasonable construction that would maintain the\nlegislature's apparent intent.\n\n\n2.\n       The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no\nstate shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states treat similarly\nsituated individuals similarly.\n\n\n3.\n       Kansas courts evaluate equal protection challenges using a three-step process.\nFirst, the court considers whether the legislation creates a classification resulting in\ndifferent treatment of similarly situated individuals. Second, if the statute does treat\narguably indistinguishable individuals differently, then the court examines the nature of\n\n\n                                              1\n\fthe classification or right at issue to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny. Finally,\nthe court applies the proper level of scrutiny to the statute.\n\n\n4.\n       Because K.S.A. 21-2512, a statute permitting postconviction DNA testing for\nsome offenders, does not burden a fundamental right or involve a suspect class, we\nanalyze any equal protection question concerning the statute by using a rational basis test.\n\n\n5.\n       By its own terms, K.S.A. 21-2512 permits only offenders convicted of\npremeditated first-degree murder or rape to receive postconviction DNA testing of\nbiological materials.\n\n\n6.\n       When a district court imposes a hard 25 life sentence, which is the mandatory off-\ngrid sentence for a Jessica's Law conviction of aggravated indecent liberties in violation\nof K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A), the offender who is 18 years of age or older receives an\nidentical sentence to an offender convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or to one\nconvicted of aggravated criminal sodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2). Thus, the\nnarrow class of offenders sentenced under Jessica's Law serving hard 25 life sentences\nfor aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 are similarly situated to\noffenders sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy.\n\n\n       Appeal from Labette District Court; ROBERT J. FLEMING, judge. Opinion filed August 21, 2015.\nReversed and remanded with directions.\n\n\n       Janine Cox, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, for appellant.\n\n\n       Natalie Chalmers, assistant solicitor general, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fBefore LEBEN, P.J., HILL and ATCHESON, JJ.\n\n\n       HILL, J.: Jason Kelsey argues that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution mandates that people in the State's custody\nthat are similarly situated must be similarly treated unless there are good reasons to treat\nthem differently. Kelsey, sentenced under Jessica's Law, is serving two concurrent\nmandatory life sentences for two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nunder the age of 14, both off-grid sex crimes. He now contends that the law which\npermits postconviction DNA testing, K.S.A. 21-2512, violates the Equal Protection\nClause because it permits testing for those serving sentences for rape or aggravated\ncriminal sodomy, also off-grid sex crimes, but not to offenders convicted of his crimes.\nHe asks us to reverse the district court's summary dismissal of his motion asking for\nDNA testing.\n\n\n       Because the law mandates identical sentences for someone who is 18 or older and\nconvicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 with those\noffenders sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy, we hold that K.S.A. 21-\n2512 does violate the Equal Protection Clause. The two classes of offenders are similarly\nsituated, and there is no rational basis for treating them differently. We reverse the district\ncourt's summary dismissal of Kelsey's motion and remand to the district court to make\nfindings on whether the three threshold requirements of K.S.A 21-2512(a) are met here,\nrequiring DNA testing.\n\n\nKelsey pled guilty.\n\n\n       Kelsey pled guilty to two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child in\nviolation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A). The court sentenced him under Jessica's Law,\nK.S.A. 21-4643(a)(1)(C), to concurrent mandatory hard 25 life sentences with no\n\n\n                                              3\n\fpossibility of parole for 25 years and also ordered lifetime postrelease supervision. He is\nnow serving his sentences.\n\n\n       Kelsey moved for postconviction DNA testing under K.S.A. 21-2512. The court\nsummarily denied his motion for a lack of standing. Simply put, since Kelsey stood\nconvicted of neither murder nor rape, in the court's view, he was not entitled to testing.\n\n\n       Kelsey appeals this ruling by challenging the constitutionality of Kansas'\npostconviction DNA testing scheme. Specifically, he argues K.S.A. 21-2512 violates the\nFourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because the statute treats similarly\nsituated offenders differently without any justification for such treatment.\n\n\n       We note that Kelsey did not raise his constitutional argument in his pro se motion\nin the district court, but it appears for the first time here in his brief to this court.\nGenerally, constitutional grounds for reversal asserted for the first time on appeal are not\nproperly before this court for review. State v. Coman, 294 Kan. 84, 89, 273 P.3d 701\n(2012). However, we address it now under an exception set forth in State v. Anderson,\n294 Kan. 450, 464-65, 276 P.3d 200 (2012)—specifically, Kelsey's newly asserted theory\ninvolves only a question of law arising on proved or admitted facts and is finally\ndeterminative of the case. See State v. Denney, 278 Kan. 643, 651, 101 P.3d 1257 (2004).\nIn Denney, the court addressed the constitutionality of K.S.A. 21-2512 for the first time\non appeal. We follow the Supreme Court's lead in Denney.\n\n\nOur standard of review and guiding principles.\n\n\n       Appellate courts presume statutes are constitutional and must resolve all doubts in\nfavor of a statute's validity. And we must interpret a statute in a way that makes it\nconstitutional if there is any reasonable construction that would maintain the legislature's\napparent intent. State v. Seward, 296 Kan. 979, 981, 297 P.3d 272 (2013).\n\n                                                 4\n\f        The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides \"[n]o state\nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"requires that states treat similarly\nsituated individuals similarly.\" State v. Cheeks, 298 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 3, 310 P.3d 346\n(2013). Kansas courts evaluate equal protection challenges using a three-step process:\n\n\n       \"First, the court considers whether the legislation creates a classification resulting in\n       different treatment of similarly situated individuals. Second, if the statute does treat\n       'arguably indistinguishable' individuals differently, then the court examines the nature of\n       the classification or right at issue to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny. Finally,\n       the court applies the proper level of scrutiny to the statute.\" (Emphasis added.) Cheeks,\n       298 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 2.\n\n\n       The level of such scrutiny is based on the rights involved. There are three levels—\nstrict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and the differential scrutiny of the rational basis\ntest. State v. Salas, 289 Kan. 245, Syl. ¶ 3, 210 P.3d 635 (2009). The Supreme Court has\npreviously determined that because K.S.A. 21-2512 does not burden a fundamental right\nor involve a suspect class, it would analyze the equal protection question using a rational\nbasis test. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8; Denney, 278 Kan. at 654. We will as well.\n\n\n       Kelsey, as the party challenging the law's constitutionality, has the burden to prove\nhe is similarly situated to other members of a class receiving different treatment, and in\nconducting our review, we are limited by the distinctions Kelsey argues. See Salas, 289\nKan. at 249. The Salas court held that \"the parameters of a court's consideration of\nwhether individuals are similarly situated [are] set by the distinctions argued by the\ncomplaining party.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fThe statute in question is limited.\n\n\n       By its own terms, K.S.A. 21-2512 permits only offenders convicted of\npremeditated first-degree murder or rape to receive postconviction DNA testing of\nbiological materials. The statute permits DNA testing if three conditions are met:\n\n\n               \"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person in state custody, at any\n       time after conviction for murder as defined by K.S.A. 21-3401, and amendments thereto,\n       or for rape as defined by K.S.A. 21-3502, and amendments thereto, may petition the court\n       that entered the judgment for forensic DNA testing (deoxyribonucleic acid testing) of any\n       biological material that:\n               \"(1) Is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in conviction;\n               \"(2) is in the actual or constructive possession of the state; and\n               \"(3) was not previously subjected to DNA testing, or can be subjected to retesting\n       with new DNA techniques that provide a reasonable likelihood of more accurate and\n       probative results.\" K.S.A. 21-2512.\n\n\n       We do not know if the three conditions listed above are satisfied because the court\nsummarily dismissed the motion. If Kelsey prevails on this equal protection attack on the\nstatute and we extend the statute to those convicted of his crime and serving a similar\nsentence to his, he will be entitled to a remand of the issue to the district court for a\nhearing to determine whether he can establish these three statutory conditions.\n\n\n       Historically, our Kansas Supreme Court has on three occasions examined this\nstatute when it was dealing with equal protection questions—Denney, 278 Kan. 643;\nSalas, 289 Kan. 245; and Cheeks, 298 Kan. 1. Collectively, the opinions give us clear\nguidance on how to proceed in this case. In looking for similarities, the court, at first,\nexamined the elements of the crimes charged but has since moved on to an examination\nof the terms of the different offenders' sentences. Reading these opinions makes it clear\nthat the sentences being served by the offenders are now determinative of our inquiry.\n\n                                                     6\n\f       First, in Denney, the Supreme Court held that K.S.A. 21-2512 violated the Equal\nProtection Clause for offenders convicted of aggravated criminal sodomy involving\npenetration of another female bodily orifice by the male sex organ. 278 Kan. at 649-61.\nThe court entertained the question for the first time on appeal as it was not raised in\nDenney's pro se motion to the district court.\n\n\n       The Denney court focused on the similarity of the elements between the crimes of\nrape and aggravated criminal sodomy under the facts of that case and found no rational\nbasis for differing treatment existed. The court concluded that Denney committed his\ncrime by penetrating his victims' anuses with his male sex organ, a crime the court found\nto be arguably indistinguishable from an offender convicted of rape by penetrating a\nfemale sex organ with his male sex organ. 278 Kan. at 653-54. Going further, the court\nrejected arguments that a rational basis for differing treatment could be based on the cost\nof testing or the differential of the severity levels of rape and criminal sodomy. 278 Kan.\nat 651-56.\n\n\n       To remedy the constitutional violation, the court declined to strike down K.S.A.\n21-2512. Instead, it extended the statute to include postconviction DNA testing for\noffenders in a similar situation as Denney's. Denney, 278 Kan. at 660. Obviously, the\nsimilarity of the criminal acts and elements of the crimes were uppermost in the court's\nanalysis in Denney.\n\n\n       Next, in Salas our Supreme Court again focused on the elements of two crimes—\npremeditated first-degree murder and intentional second-degree murder. Limiting itself to\nconsidering only the offenders that Salas claimed to be similarly situated, the court held\nthat K.S.A. 21-2512 providing postconviction DNA testing if an offender is convicted of\nfirst-degree premeditated murder does not violate equal protection by not extending the\nsame right to offenders convicted of intentional second-degree murder. 289 Kan. at 249-\n51. The court concluded that offenders who commit first-degree murder with\n\n                                                7\n\fpremeditation are not similarly situated to those offenders convicted of intentional\nsecond-degree murder. The difference is the premeditation element, which the court\nconsidered to be a rational basis for differing treatment. 289 Kan. at 250-51.\n\n\n       Finally, in Cheeks the court addressed the equal protection challenge left\nunanswered in Salas—a challenge not based on the elements of the crimes of second-\ndegree murder and first-degree premeditated murder, but based on the punishment\nimposed for both crimes. Because Cheeks framed his \"similarly situated\" analysis on the\npunishment imposed for the crime—not the elements of the crime or the conduct that\nviolates those elements—Salas did not control the court's decision in Cheeks. 298 Kan. at\n6.\n\n\n       Instead, the court held that because Cheeks received the maximum indeterminate\nsentence of 15 years to life for second-degree murder, he was similarly situated to\noffenders convicted of first-degree premeditated murder who received a life sentence.\nThose offenders were also parole eligible after 15 years, but they could petition for\npostconviction DNA testing under K.S.A. 21-2512. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 7. The court,\nciting Denney, concluded no rational basis existed for the differing treatment of similarly\nsituated offenders under K.S.A. 21-2512. The court once again found the statute was\nunconstitutional and expanded the statute to include those offenders convicted of second-\ndegree murder and receiving the presentencing guidelines maximum penalty of 15-years-\nto-life imprisonment. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8-13.\n\n\nHow Kelsey frames his argument is important to our inquiry.\n\n\n       Kelsey asks us to expand K.S.A. 21-2512 to those offenders convicted under\nK.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A). He cites Cheeks for support. He contends the similarly situated\nclass is defined by the sentence received:\n\n\n                                             8\n\f               \"[Kelsey's] conviction for aggravated indecent liberties . . . places him in a\n       strikingly similar position for length of sentence comparison, relative to those individuals\n       convicted of rape and aggravated criminal sodomy, just as Mr. Cheeks' sentence for\n       second degree murder placed him in a similar position relative to those serving sentences\n       for first degree murder.\"\n\n\n       In setting these narrow limits, Kelsey is arguing that offenders who receive a\nmandatory hard 25 life sentence under K.S.A. 21-4643 for committing aggravated\nindecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 in violation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A)\nare similarly situated to individuals sentenced for rape under K.S.A. 21-3502 and\naggravated criminal sodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506. Thus, because Kelsey is framing the\nrelevant distinction for our \"similarly situated\" analysis on the sentence the district court\nimposed, not the elements of the crimes or the conduct violating those elements, Cheeks\ncontrols our decision in this case. See 298 Kan. at 6-7.\n\n\n       In opposition, the State declines to apply an equal protection analysis under\nCheeks. The State simply suggests this court find the dissenting opinions in Cheeks more\npersuasive than the majority opinion. However, as the State also acknowledged in making\nthis suggestion, this court is duty bound to follow Kansas Supreme Court precedent,\nunless there is some indication the court is departing from its previous position. State v.\nOttinger, 46 Kan. App. 2d 647, 655, 264 P.3d 1027 (2011), rev. denied 294 Kan. 946\n(2012). We have found no indication of an intention to depart.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we must decide whether Kelsey has met the threshold requirement\nby proving he is similarly situated to a group covered under the statute. See Cheeks, 298\nKan. 1, Syl. ¶ 2. We hold he has done so.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fA review of the sentencing statutes is helpful.\n\n\n       A person 18 or older convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under\nthe age of 14 in violation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A) is guilty of an off-grid person\nfelony requiring a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years.\nK.S.A. 21-4643(a)(1)(C). Rape and aggravated criminal sodomy are similarly off-grid\nperson felonies when the victim is under the age of 14 and the offender is 18 years of age\nor older. K.S.A. 21-3502(c); K.S.A. 21-3506(c). Therefore, an offender 18 years of age or\nolder convicted under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2) also\nreceives a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years. K.S.A. 21-\n4643(a)(1)(B), (D).\n\n\n       The length of sentences imposed for a conviction under the remaining categories\nof rape and aggravated criminal sodomy vary with the criminal history of the offender. A\nperson convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1) or (a)(2) is guilty of a severity level\n1 person felony, except, as provided above, under subsection (a)(2) when the offender is\n18 years of age or older, whereas rape as described under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(3) or (a)(4)\nis a severity level 2 person felony. K.S.A. 21-3502(c). And, except as provided above, all\nother convictions for aggravated criminal sodomy are severity level 1 person felonies.\nK.S.A. 21-3506(c). Therefore, a severity level 1 rape/aggravated criminal sodomy\nconviction and a severity level 2 rape conviction has a presumptive sentencing range\nfrom 117 months and 155 months respectively for criminal history category I at the low\nend of the sentencing grid, to 467 months and 620 months respectively for criminal\nhistory category A at the high end. See K.S.A. 21-4704(a).\n\n\n       Given these vast sentencing ranges that are dependent upon an offender's criminal\nhistory, it could be argued that a person sentenced under K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A) is not\nsimilarly situated to certain individuals requesting postconviction DNA testing after\nbeing sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy at the high end of the sentencing\n\n                                             10\n\fgrid—467 or 620 months. On the other hand, K.S.A. 21-2512 does permit postconviction\nDNA testing for offenders receiving considerably less than the sentence for an off-grid\nperson felony under K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A).\n\n\n       More importantly, when a district court imposes the mandatory off-grid sentence\nfor a Jessica's Law conviction of aggravated indecent liberties in violation of K.S.A. 21-\n3504(a)(3)(A), the offender who is 18 years of age or older receives the identical\nsentence as if convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or aggravated criminal\nsodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2).\n\n\n       Staying within the limits set by Kelsey's argument, we hold that the narrow class\nof offenders sentenced under Jessica's Law for aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nunder the age of 14 are similarly situated to offenders sentenced for rape or aggravated\ncriminal sodomy and serving hard 25 life sentences. Kelsey has met the threshold\nrequirement.\n\n\n       Moving to the remaining steps of our analysis, since there is no indication our\nSupreme Court is departing from Cheeks, we remain constrained by the court's\nconclusion regarding the rational basis analysis and the remedy for an equal protection\nviolation. See Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8-13.\n\n\n       We employ the rational basis test because that is what the Supreme Court used in\nboth Denney, 278 Kan. at 651-52, and Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8. Therefore, Kelsey must\nmeet his burden by negating \"'\"every conceivable [reasonable] basis which might\nsupport\"' the differing treatment.\" Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8. Indeed, the Cheeks court\nclarified that in considering the possible rational bases offered, the means and the\nclassification of the statute in question must meet a legitimate legislative goal:\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       \"We do not focus on the legislature's actual rationale for the classification. Rather, we\n       consider whether the legislature could have had a legitimate reason for drawing the\n       challenged classification. [Citation omitted.] To pass the rational basis test, the statute\n       must foster legitimate goals and the means chosen to achieve the state's goals must 'bear a\n       rational relationship to those goals.' [Citation omitted.] In other words, the proffered\n       rational basis must be more than simply a legitimate legislative goal, the '\"'\"classification\n       [must] bear [ ] some reasonable relationship to a valid legislative objective.\"'\"' (Emphasis\n       added.) [Citations omitted.] Put another way, the proffered rational basis must both\n       explain the distinction drawn by the statute between two classes of individuals and be a\n       legitimate legislative objective.\" 298 Kan. at 8.\n\n\n       Kelsey simply cites Cheeks, where the court considered and rejected both the cost\nof the testing and the severity levels of the crimes as reasons to justify excluding second-\ndegree murder. 298 Kan. at 8-9.\n\n\n       We assume that the cost of the DNA testing here would be the same as in Cheeks,\nwhere the court rejected the cost of testing as a legitimate rationale for differing\ntreatment. We do so as well. See 298 Kan. at 9; Denney, 278 Kan. at 654. We focus then\non severity levels.\n\n\n       In the earliest case dealing with this issue—Denney—our Supreme Court in\nsearching for a rational basis sua sponte looked at severity levels of the crimes and\nsuggested, \"the legislature may have intended to allow postconviction DNA testing based\non the severity of the crime.\" 278 Kan. at 654. In examining the differences between a\nseverity level 2 felony for aggravated criminal sodomy and a severity level 1 felony for\nrape by force or fear, the court acknowledged, \"differences in severity level could be a\nrational basis for distinguishing between when [postconviction] DNA testing is allowed\nand when not.\" Denney, 278 Kan. at 655.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f       However, citing K.S.A. 21-4707(a), which provides that \"[c]rimes listed within\neach [severity] level are considered to be relatively equal in severity,\" the court rejected\nthe rational basis of crime severity level given that, in some instances, aggravated\ncriminal sodomy had the same severity level as rape. Denney, 278 Kan. at 655-56.\n\n\n       Then, more recently, in Cheeks, our Supreme Court rejected the State's suggestion\nthat the severity of the crime was a rational basis to exclude second-degree murder from\nK.S.A. 21-2512 for the same reason used in Denney. Citing K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-\n6807(a), the court pointed out that even though first-degree murder was classified as an\noff-grid felony when the legislature enacted K.S.A. 21-2512, the legislature included rape\nas a crime eligible for postconviction DNA testing and that both rape and second-degree\nmurder, both being level 1 or 2 person felonies, were \"'relatively equal in severity.'\"\nCheeks, 298 Kan. at 10. In other words, similar does not mean identical when focusing on\nseverity levels of crimes when making this type of analysis.\n\n\n       We are constrained to follow the ruling in Cheeks. As the Supreme Court did in\nCheeks, we find no legitimate legislative goal that is met by this distinction in severity\nlevels of the crimes for the purpose of an equal protection analysis. Given Kansas'\nobvious commitment to exoneration of the innocent through DNA—both sampling and\nlater testing—and following our Supreme Court's lead in extending K.S.A. 21-2512\nrather than nullifying the statute in such instances as here, we likewise extend K.S.A. 21-\n2512 to include testing for those in the same situation as Kelsey. See Cheeks, 298 Kan. at\n12; Denney, 278 Kan. at 660.\n\n\n       In so holding, we clarify that, like Cheeks, we are not adding a new crime to the\nstatute's coverage but are expanding the statute to cover a much narrower class of\noffenders, i.e., offenders convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the\nage of 14 and sentenced under Jessica's Law to the mandatory hard 25 life sentence.\nSince the district court summarily rejected Kelsey's motion based on the face of the\n\n                                             13\n\fstatute and made no findings regarding the three statutory requirements of K.S.A. 21-\n2512(a), Kelsey is only entitled to a remand to the district court for a hearing to\ndetermine whether he can establish those three statutory requirements. See Cheeks, 298\nKan. at 4.\n\n\n        Reversed and remanded for additional findings.\n\n\n                                              ***\n\n\n        ATCHESON, J., concurring: Jason D. Kelsey has a right to seek DNA testing to\nchallenge his convictions for aggravated indecent liberties with a child because the\nJessica's Law sentence he received makes him materially indistinguishable from\ncriminals statutorily entitled to request such testing under Kansas law. K.S.A. 21-2512.\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution requires that sort of consistency in a state's extension of rights or benefits. I\nagree with Judge Hill's conclusion grounded in the Equal Protection Clause. But the\nKansas courts take an odd approach to analyzing equal protection claims by imposing a\nrequirement that those persons asserting a denial of a government right or benefit first\ndemonstrate they are \"similarly situated\" to those receiving the right or benefit. That\npotentially dispositive threshold test has crept fog-like into our cases on little cat feet. It\nhasn't a basis in generally accepted equal protection jurisprudence, and akin to a morning\nfog, it obscures the landscape to no particularly useful ends and conceivably dangerous\nones.\n\n\n        The Equal Protection Clause prevents state and local governments from treating\ngroups of people differently, whether through legislative enactment or other policies and\npractices, without some justification. See Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553\nU.S. 591, 601, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008) (\"Our equal protection\njurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental classifications that 'affect\n\n                                               14\n\fsome groups of citizens differently than others.'\") (quoting McGowan v. Maryland, 366\nU.S. 420, 425, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393 [1961]); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75-76,\n92 S. Ct. 251, 30 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1971) (\"The Equal Protection Clause . . . den[ies] to\nStates the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a\nstatute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of\nthat statute.\"); Jurado v.

Co., 253 Kan. 116, 123, 853 P.2d 669 (1993)\n(\"[E]qual protection requires . . . that legislative classifications be reasonable, not\narbitrary, and that they be justified by legitimate legislative objectives.\"); see also\nFitzgerald v.

The\nnature of the classification or division dictates the degree of justification the\ngovernmental entity must advance for its action. The United States Supreme Court has\nrecognized three levels of review or scrutiny for equal protection challenges.\n\n\n       When a government classification burdens a fundamental right or divides based\nupon characteristics considered inherently suspect in granting benefits or imposing\nburdens—including race, national origin, and alienage—courts apply the most rigorous\nreview, commonly known as strict scrutiny. A classification survives strict scrutiny only\nif it furthers compelling government interests and is narrowly tailored to advance those\ninterests. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-17, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982);\nZablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 388, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1978); Bostic v.\nSchaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 375 & n.6 (4th Cir. 2014); Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193,\n1218 (10th Cir. 2014). A few other group characteristics, notably gender and illegitimacy,\nhave been treated as \"quasi-suspect,\" invoking a heightened level of judicial review,\nthough less demanding than strict scrutiny. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.\nCt. 1910, 100 L. Ed. 2d 465 (1988); Hayden v. Greensburg Community School, 743 F.3d\n569, 577 (7th Cir. 2014) (gender); Pierre v. Holder, 738 F.3d 39, 50 (2d Cir. 2013)\n(gender and legitimacy). Courts require statutes distinguishing among people on quasi-\nsuspect bases to be \"substantially related to an important governmental objective.\" Clark,\n\n                                              15\n\f486 U.S. at 461; see Morales-Santana v. Lynch, ___ F.3d ___, 2015 WL 4097296, at *5\n(2d Cir. 2015). That requires the actual purpose for or justification of the statute's\ndifferential treatment to be \"exceedingly persuasive.\" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S.\n515, 532-33, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996); see Morales-Santana, 2015 WL\n4097296, at *5; Hayden, 743 F.3d at 577. But most economic and social regulation\naffects neither a fundamental right nor a protected class characteristic. In those instances,\ncourts apply a relaxed, \"rational basis\" review to an equal protection challenge. See\nVacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799, 117 S. Ct. 2293, 138 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1997); Kwong v.\nBloomberg, 723 F.3d 160, 172 (2d Cir. 2013). A government classification survives\nrational basis review if \"'a plausible policy reason'\" supports the scheme and it is not so\nremoved from that reason as to result in an \"'arbitrary or irrational'\" distinction.\nFitzgerald v. Racing Assn. of Central Iowa, 539 U.S. 103, 107, 123 S. Ct. 2156, 156 L.\nEd. 2d 97 (2003) (quoting Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11-12, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L.\nEd. 2d 1 [1992]); see Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-20, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d\n257 (1993); State v. Cheeks, 298 Kan. 1, 9, 310 P.3d 346 (2013). The statute or other\nregulation may be upheld for any justifiable purpose; the purpose need not be the one that\nprompted its adoption. See McDonald v. Board of Election, 394 U.S. 802, 809, 89 S. Ct.\n1404, 22 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1969); Estate of Kunze v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\n233 F.3d 948, 954 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has been clear about how equal protection\nchallenges should be analyzed. A court should first determine the appropriate level of\nreview: rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny. And the court should then\napply that standard to evaluate the constitutional propriety of the governmental\nclassification in light of the regulatory purposes or objectives. See Armour v. City of\nIndianapolis, 566 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 2073, 2079-81, 182 L. Ed. 2d 998 (2012);\nAttorney General of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 906 & n.6, 106 S. Ct. 2317, 90 L.\nEd. 2d 899 (1986) (plurality); 476 U.S. at 924 (O'Connor, J., dissenting, joined by\nRehnquist, J. and Stevens, J.); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L.\n\n                                              16\n\fEd. 2d 274 (1972). The Court does not engage in a preliminary inquiry asking whether\nthe groups created by a statute are \"similarly situated\" (and, in turn, dispense with any\nfurther analysis if they are not). In San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1,\n17, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973), the Court outlined the appropriate approach to\nan equal protection challenge:\n\n       \"We must decide, first, whether the Texas system of financing public education operates\n       to the disadvantage of some suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly\n       or implicitly protected by the Constitution, thereby requiring strict judicial scrutiny. . . . If\n       not, the Texas scheme must still be examined to determine whether it rationally furthers\n       some legitimate, articulated state purpose and therefore does not constitute [a] . . .\n       violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\nTo arrive at the correct level of scrutiny, a court necessarily must assess how the\ngovernmental action classifies, thereby defining the characteristics that set the\ndisadvantaged group apart from the benefited group or identifying a fundamental right\nthat has been impinged. But that is nothing like a potentially dispositive comparison of\nthe groups to decide if they are somehow sufficiently similar.\n\n\n       For the most part, lower courts define the first task in equal protection analysis to\nbe a determination of the applicable degree of scrutiny—to the extent they explicitly\ndescribe the sequencing of the steps at all. See, e.g., Connelly v. Steel Valley School Dist.,\n706 F.3d 209, 213 (3d Cir. 2013) (\"We begin by considering which equal protection\nstandard governs our review. . . . \"); Doe v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole,\n513 F.3d 95, 107 (3d Cir. 2008) (\"In reviewing a claim that government action violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause, we must first determine the appropriate standard by which\nwe are to review the claim.\"); Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority, 386 F.3d 1148, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (\"The first step in analyzing [the] claim\nthat this disparate treatment violated equal protection is to determine the proper level of\nscrutiny.\"); Breck v. State of Michigan, 203 F.3d 392, 395 (6th Cir. 2000); Richard v.\n\n                                                      17\n\fHinson, 70 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir. 1995).[1] The Kansas Supreme Court has described\nthe analytical method that way, too. See, e.g., Gleason v. Samaritan Home, 260 Kan. 970,\n988, 926 P.2d 1349 (1996) (\"The first step in an equal protection analysis is determining\nwhich level of scrutiny to apply to a statute which distinguishes between classes of\nindividuals.\"); Bair v. Peck, 248 Kan. 824, 830, 811 P.2d 1176 (1991).\n\n      [1]In the for what it's worth department, Chief Justice of the United States John\nRoberts wrote Hedgepeth during his time on the federal appellate bench.\n\n       The Kansas Supreme Court, however, has drifted from that established equal\nprotection jurisprudence to incorporate a new threshold test requiring that the constituents\nof the classifications created by a statute or other government action be \"similarly\nsituated\" to advance a constitutional claim. The origins of that criterion are murky. And,\nas I discuss, the notion serves no useful purpose. The court recognized the proposition in\nState v. Salas, 289 Kan. 245, 248, 210 P.3d 635 (2009), and cited Hodges v. Johnson, 288\nKan. 56, 72, 199 P.3d 1251 (2009), State v. Denney, 278 Kan. 643, 652, 101 P.3d 1257\n(2004), and Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct.\n3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985), for support.\n\n\n       But Hodges neither directly states nor actually applies such a test. In Denney, the\ncourt considered an equal protection challenge from an individual convicted of\naggravated sodomy who wanted postconviction testing of DNA evidence, although\nK.S.A. 21-2512 granted testing only to persons convicted of rape and murder. The court\nundertook an initial comparison of the elements of aggravated criminal sodomy\napplicable to Denney, pronounced them \"arguably indistinguishable\" from the elements\nof rape, and then extended DNA testing to Denney because the legislative classification\npermitting testing in rape convictions but not convictions for at least some forms of\nsodomy lacked any rational basis. Denney, 278 Kan. at 652-54, 656. The Denney decision\ncited no authority for its \"threshold\" examination of the elements of the crimes as a\nprerequisite to the traditional equal protection analysis. 278 Kan. at 653-54. The\n\n                                              18\n\fcomparison of the statutory elements would have been a significant part of a traditional\nanalysis—if the elements of the crimes were markedly different, that would likely\nprovide a rational basis for the legislature allowing DNA testing for convictions of one\nand not the other.\n\n\n       In outlining the applicable constitutional principles, Denney relies almost\nexclusively on Mudd v. Neosho Memorial Regional Med. Center, 275 Kan. 187, 62 P.3d\n236 (2003). But Mudd uses traditional equal protection analysis identifying the level of\nscrutiny and then assessing the appropriateness of the governmental classification in light\nof that standard. 275 Kan. at 197-200. The case does not suggest some preliminary step\nbased on a comparison of the attributes of the constituents in the groups created by the\nclassification.\n\n\n       In Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439, the Court described the Equal Protection Clause as\n\"essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" The\ndescription, however, summarized the purpose of the provision rather than an analytical\ntool for assessing an asserted equal protection violation. The Court, however, did turn\nimmediately to a discussion of those tools and outlined, among other things, rational\nbasis review, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. 473 U.S. at 439-42. But the Court\nnever mentioned a threshold requirement for a comparison establishing substantial\nsimilarity across the governmental classification or how that comparison might be\nundertaken. Nor did it make such a comparison in deciding the equal protection issue.\n\n\n       The Kansas Supreme Court also used a threshold \"similarly situated\" test in In re\nTax Appeal of Weisgerber, 285 Kan. 98, 106, 169 P.3d 321 (2007), ostensibly because\nthe Equal Protection Clause prohibits government regulation treating \"'arguably\nindistinguishable' classes of people differently.\" (Quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600,\n609, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 [1974].) The court also cited Reed, 404 U.S. at 75-\n76, as supporting that approach. But Ross and Reed—like Cleburne—simply summarized\n\n                                             19\n\fthe constitutional right afforded in the Equal Protection Clause and not the analytical\nmethod for evaluating those claims. In fact, the classes can be different in ways having\nnothing to do with the government's purpose in creating the classification itself and\nnonetheless violate the Equal Protection Clause. A classification runs afoul of the\nconstitutional protection if, taking account of the applicable level of scrutiny, the classes\ncreated cannot be fairly distinguished with respect to the benefit bestowed or the burden\nimposed. The Reed decision said as much: \"A classification 'must be reasonable, not\narbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial\nrelation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall\nbe treated alike.'\" 404 U.S. at 76 (quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412,\n415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L. Ed. 989 [1920]).\n\n\n       More recently, the Kansas Supreme Court has continued to apply a gatekeeper\n\"similarly situated\" test for equal protection claims by citing its own cases coming after\nWeisgerber and Salas as authority. See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 295 Kan. 636, 666, 289\nP.3d 1098 (2012) (citing Board of Miami County Comm'rs v. Kanza Rail-Trails\nConservancy, Inc., 292 Kan. 285, 315, 255 P.3d 1186 [2011]; State v. Huerta, 291 Kan.\n831, 834, 247 P.3d 1043 [2011]); Kanza Rail-Trails Conservancy, Inc., 292 Kan. at 315\n(citing Salas, 289 Kan. at 248); Huerta, 291 Kan. at 834 (citing Salas, 289 Kan. at 248).\nThat sort of repetition doesn't strengthen an otherwise doubtful rule, especially one\nconstruing federal constitutional law.[2]\n\n\n       [2]Also in the for what it's worth category, the Kansas Supreme Court suggested a\n\"similarly situated\" prerequisite for equal protection claims in Bonin v. Vannaman, 261\nKan. 199, 223, 929 P.2d 754 (1996), and Smith v. Printup, 254 Kan. 315, 321-22, 866\nP.2d 985 (1993). In Bonin, Justice Abbott cited only Smith for that notion. And in Smith,\nJustice Davis cited no direct authority in affirming the dismissal of an equal protection\nclaim in two paragraphs. But several years later in Gleason, 260 Kan. at 988, Justice\nDavis expressly outlined and applied a traditional equal protection analysis beginning\nwith an identification of the governing level of scrutiny. Justice Abbott, however,\ncontinued to treat the \"similarly situated\" test as the initial step in equal protection\nanalysis. See Injured Workers of Kansas v. Franklin, 262 Kan. 840, 857, 942 P.2d 591\n\n                                              20\n\f(1997) (obliquely referring to Smith, 254 Kan. at 321, but citing no other authority).\nThreads of Smith influenced the court in Weisgerber, 285 Kan. at 104, 107. The Kansas\ncourts have hopscotched around in addressing the analytical model for equal protection\nclaims over the past quarter century.\n\n        The Kansas Supreme Court, however, is not alone in that respect. For example,\nsome panels of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit use a\ncomparable \"similarly situated\" test as the initial step in assessing equal protection\nclaims. See Sansotta v. Town of Nags Head, 724 F.3d 533, 542 (4th Cir. 2013); Morrison\nv. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001). Other panels do not and, rather, adhere\nto conventional equal protection analysis. See United States v. Timms, 664 F.3d 436, 445\n(4th Cir. 2012); Greenville Women's Clinic v. Bryant, 222 F.3d 157, 203 (4th Cir. 2000).\nThe Morrison decision appears to be the fountainhead for the test. The panel cited\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 439-40, and two earlier Fourth Circuit cases as authority. But\nCleburne does not recognize or support the notion. Nor do the earlier circuit cases. In re\nLong Term Administrative Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters, 174\nF.3d 464, 471 (4th Cir. 1999) (equal protection claim properly dismissed because\nplaintiffs failed to show any disparate treatment); Sylvia Development Corp. v. Calvert\nCounty, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 818-20 (4th Cir. 1995) (government action must purposefully\nclassify in an impermissible way to violate Equal Protection Clause).\n\n       The United States Supreme Court neither endorses nor applies the analytical\napproach the Kansas Supreme Court now follows. If Cleburne, Ross, or Reed actually\nimposed an initial \"similarly situated\" requirement, the Court would have used that\ncriterion in deciding later equal protection cases. But plainly, the Court has not. There\nisn't a hint of such a condition in its decisions. See Armour, 132 S. Ct. at 2079-80; Romer\nv. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 134 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1996). The ruling in\nCleburne actually contravenes the notion. 473 U.S. at 447-48 (Although recognizing the\nintellectually disabled \"as a group are indeed different from others not sharing their\nmisfortune,\" the Court found no rational basis for a municipal regulation requiring a\nspecial use permit for a group home for the intellectually disabled when no comparable\napproval was necessary for other communal housing arrangements including\nconvalescent or nursing homes, sororities and fraternities, and boarding houses.).\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       Ultimately, a state court cannot add a potentially dispositive element to federal\nequal protection law any more than it could jettison strict scrutiny or declare sex to be a\nclassification undeserving of heightened review. See State v. Lawson, 296 Kan. 1084,\n1089, 297 P.3d 1164 (2013) (United States Supreme Court decisions controlling on\nmatters of federal constitutional law); State v. Galaviz, 296 Kan. 168, 180, 291 P.3d 62\n(2012).\n\n\n       In most equal protection cases, the Kansas analytical model—requiring an initial\nshowing that the government action results in \"similarly situated\" classes—probably\nmakes no difference in the outcome. That would be true here. But the added and\npotentially dispositive preliminary step is more than an academic exercise. Depending on\nhow the test is supposed to be applied, it would make a substantive difference in some\ncases. And it necessarily distracts from and confounds a proper evaluation of equal\nprotection claims.\n\n\n       If the similarly situated test applies to the overall characteristics of one class as\ncompared to the overall characteristics of the other class or classes created by a statute or\nother governmental action, the standard would effectively terminate some equal\nprotection claims that ought to go forward. That sort of comparison would be an abstract\none unrelated to the purpose of the governmental classification. At least some of the\nKansas caselaw suggests an abstract comparison. See Salas, 289 Kan. at 251;\nWeisgerber, 285 Kan. at 106.\n\n\n       Under that approach, for example, Cleburne presumably would have come out\ndifferently. As I have indicated, the Court determined that intellectually disabled adults,\nas a group, differed significantly from those with roughly normal intellectual capacity.\nSee Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448. Under the Kansas criteria for analyzing equal protection\nchallenges—assuming the initial comparison to be an abstract one—that should have\nended the case in the city's favor. But, of course, the Court found an equal protection\n\n                                              22\n\fviolation, precluding the city from enforcing its permit requirement against the group\nhome.\n        Similarly, in Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257\n(1993), the United States Supreme Court considered an equal protection challenge to\nKentucky's involuntary commitment procedures because, among other differences, they\nimposed a more rigorous standard of proof for committing the mentally ill than for the\nintellectually disabled. The Court recognized substantial differences between the\nmentally ill as a class and the intellectually disabled as a class, particularly concerning\ninstitutional care and treatment. 509 U.S. at 326-28. But that recognition did not\nterminate the case. The Court reviewed the differences in procedure using a rational basis\ntest and found them to be constitutionally permissible under the Equal Protection Clause.\n509 U.S. at 328.\n\n\n        The test would also seem to lead to doubtful results in some equal protection\nclaims challenging sex-based classifications. Suppose, for example, a relatively small\nmunicipality required firefighters to meet specific strength and fitness standards to\ngraduate from the training academy, and few women, even after the training, could do so.\nThe fire chief proposed and the city commission adopted the standards to avoid hiring\nfemale firefighters because they thought it would be bad for departmental cohesiveness\nand would likely require at least some renovation of the fire station's facilities. So the\nmunicipality has a written policy allowing only men between 19 and 26 years old to\napply to be firefighters. A woman files suit attacking the men-only application criterion\nas an equal protection violation. The government regulation plainly creates a disfavored\nclass of women and a favored class of men—with a purpose of denying a benefit to\nwomen based on their sex. But men and women arguably aren't similarly situated. They\nhave demonstrable anatomical differences. And they have significantly different roles in\nthe procreative process. Normatively, men are, in fact, bigger and stronger than women.\nSome women are fitter and stronger than some men, and some (but not very many)\n\n\n                                              23\n\fwomen could meet the municipality's training standards. Arguably, at least, those\ndifferences would be enough to cut off the equal protection claim under the Kansas test.\n\n\n       But doing so would eliminate any consideration of the heightened, intermediate\nscrutiny required for classifications based on sex. The more rigorous equal protection\nreview likely would defeat the municipality's argument that the men-only policy\npromotes administrative convenience and saves costs because few women could meet the\nstrength and fitness requirements even with training, so permitting them to apply at all\nwould be wasteful. The physical requirements themselves could be attacked under the\nheightened standard as a product of intentional discrimination rather than as job-\nappropriate in some rational way. The equal protection claim would be a meritorious\none.[3]\n\n\n       [3]The scenario also violates Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (2012),\nprohibiting employment discrimination based on sex and other protected characteristics.\nBut Title VII claims have a comparatively short limitations period and administrative\nexhaustion requirements that constitutional equal protection claims do not. Title VII also\ndoes not apply to very small employers. So an aggrieved party may have a viable equal\nprotection claim without a companion Title VII claim. Liability issues aside, Title VII\nsignificantly limits noneconomic damages against smaller employers. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981a(a)(1), (b)(3) (2012). There are no comparable caps on damages for equal\nprotection violations by state governmental entities brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n       The Kansas test, then, could short-circuit proper equal protection review and has\nthe potential to prematurely terminate legitimate claims. Moreover, the initial \"similarly\nsituated\" determination seems to be one without an objective or even cognizable measure.\nThat criterion looks to be an empty vessel in which a court can pour whatever it wants.\n\n\n       Even if the similarly situated criterion were to be applied within the context of the\nchallenged governmental classification, so that the nature of the division and its\nostensible purpose inform the determination, the test serves no good purpose. Evaluating\nthe similarities and differences between the classes created by the government action\n\n                                             24\n\fessentially replicates much of what a court is supposed to do under traditional equal\nprotection analysis after establishing the appropriate level of scrutiny. See Armour, 132\nS. Ct. at 2079-82 (Court reviews for rationality city's justifications for change in\nassessing costs of sewer projects, resulting in forgiveness of some property owners'\nunpaid assessments but no refunds to other property owners who had already paid\nassessments); Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 17; Reed, 404 U.S. at 75-76. There is no reason for\na court to take up part of that task before fixing the applicable scrutiny. Doing so, at the\nvery least, fragments the analytical process without lending any clarity or other benefit to\nthe decisionmaking. But in those cases calling for heightened scrutiny, the effect could be\nsignificantly distorting, since the court would be reviewing the impact of the\ngovernmental classification without fully considering whether the differences created are\njustified by especially persuasive reasons.\n\n\n       Today, I am comfortable that we have come to the correct conclusion in applying\nthe Equal Protection Clause to the issue before us. But I would prefer following a path\nless foggy to get there.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f",

Courts must interpret a statute in a way that makes the statute\nin question constitutional if there is any reasonable construction that would maintain the\nlegislature's apparent intent.\n\n\n2.\n       The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no\nstate shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states treat similarly\nsituated individuals similarly.\n\n\n3.\n       Kansas courts evaluate equal protection challenges using a three-step process.\nFirst, the court considers whether the legislation creates a classification resulting in\ndifferent treatment of similarly situated individuals. Second, if the statute does treat\narguably indistinguishable individuals differently, then the court examines the nature of\n\n\n                                              1\n\fthe classification or right at issue to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny. Finally,\nthe court applies the proper level of scrutiny to the statute.\n\n\n4.\n       Because K.S.A. 21-2512, a statute permitting postconviction DNA testing for\nsome offenders, does not burden a fundamental right or involve a suspect class, we\nanalyze any equal protection question concerning the statute by using a rational basis test.\n\n\n5.\n       By its own terms, K.S.A. 21-2512 permits only offenders convicted of\npremeditated first-degree murder or rape to receive postconviction DNA testing of\nbiological materials.\n\n\n6.\n       When a district court imposes a hard 25 life sentence, which is the mandatory off-\ngrid sentence for a Jessica's Law conviction of aggravated indecent liberties in violation\nof K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A), the offender who is 18 years of age or older receives an\nidentical sentence to an offender convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or to one\nconvicted of aggravated criminal sodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2). Thus, the\nnarrow class of offenders sentenced under Jessica's Law serving hard 25 life sentences\nfor aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 are similarly situated to\noffenders sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy.\n\n\n       Appeal from Labette District Court; ROBERT J. FLEMING, judge. Opinion filed August 21, 2015.\nReversed and remanded with directions.\n\n\n       Janine Cox, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, for appellant.\n\n\n       Natalie Chalmers, assistant solicitor general, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fBefore LEBEN, P.J., HILL and ATCHESON, JJ.\n\n\n       HILL, J.: Jason Kelsey argues that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution mandates that people in the State's custody\nthat are similarly situated must be similarly treated unless there are good reasons to treat\nthem differently. Kelsey, sentenced under Jessica's Law, is serving two concurrent\nmandatory life sentences for two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nunder the age of 14, both off-grid sex crimes. He now contends that the law which\npermits postconviction DNA testing, K.S.A. 21-2512, violates the Equal Protection\nClause because it permits testing for those serving sentences for rape or aggravated\ncriminal sodomy, also off-grid sex crimes, but not to offenders convicted of his crimes.\nHe asks us to reverse the district court's summary dismissal of his motion asking for\nDNA testing.\n\n\n       Because the law mandates identical sentences for someone who is 18 or older and\nconvicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 with those\noffenders sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy, we hold that K.S.A. 21-\n2512 does violate the Equal Protection Clause. The two classes of offenders are similarly\nsituated, and there is no rational basis for treating them differently. We reverse the district\ncourt's summary dismissal of Kelsey's motion and remand to the district court to make\nfindings on whether the three threshold requirements of K.S.A 21-2512(a) are met here,\nrequiring DNA testing.\n\n\nKelsey pled guilty.\n\n\n       Kelsey pled guilty to two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child in\nviolation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A). The court sentenced him under Jessica's Law,\nK.S.A. 21-4643(a)(1)(C), to concurrent mandatory hard 25 life sentences with no\n\n\n                                              3\n\fpossibility of parole for 25 years and also ordered lifetime postrelease supervision. He is\nnow serving his sentences.\n\n\n       Kelsey moved for postconviction DNA testing under K.S.A. 21-2512. The court\nsummarily denied his motion for a lack of standing. Simply put, since Kelsey stood\nconvicted of neither murder nor rape, in the court's view, he was not entitled to testing.\n\n\n       Kelsey appeals this ruling by challenging the constitutionality of Kansas'\npostconviction DNA testing scheme. Specifically, he argues K.S.A. 21-2512 violates the\nFourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because the statute treats similarly\nsituated offenders differently without any justification for such treatment.\n\n\n       We note that Kelsey did not raise his constitutional argument in his pro se motion\nin the district court, but it appears for the first time here in his brief to this court.\nGenerally, constitutional grounds for reversal asserted for the first time on appeal are not\nproperly before this court for review.

The Supreme Court has\npreviously determined that because K.S.A. 21-2512 does not burden a fundamental right\nor involve a suspect class, it would analyze the equal protection question using a rational\nbasis test. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8; Denney, 278 Kan. at 654. We will as well.\n\n\n       Kelsey, as the party challenging the law's constitutionality, has the burden to prove\nhe is similarly situated to other members of a class receiving different treatment, and in\nconducting our review, we are limited by the distinctions Kelsey argues. See Salas, 289\nKan. at 249. The Salas court held that \"the parameters of a court's consideration of\nwhether individuals are similarly situated [are] set by the distinctions argued by the\ncomplaining party.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fThe statute in question is limited.\n\n\n       By its own terms, K.S.A. 21-2512 permits only offenders convicted of\npremeditated first-degree murder or rape to receive postconviction DNA testing of\nbiological materials. The statute permits DNA testing if three conditions are met:\n\n\n               \"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person in state custody, at any\n       time after conviction for murder as defined by K.S.A. 21-3401, and amendments thereto,\n       or for rape as defined by K.S.A. 21-3502, and amendments thereto, may petition the court\n       that entered the judgment for forensic DNA testing (deoxyribonucleic acid testing) of any\n       biological material that:\n               \"(1) Is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in conviction;\n               \"(2) is in the actual or constructive possession of the state; and\n               \"(3) was not previously subjected to DNA testing, or can be subjected to retesting\n       with new DNA techniques that provide a reasonable likelihood of more accurate and\n       probative results.\" K.S.A. 21-2512.\n\n\n       We do not know if the three conditions listed above are satisfied because the court\nsummarily dismissed the motion. If Kelsey prevails on this equal protection attack on the\nstatute and we extend the statute to those convicted of his crime and serving a similar\nsentence to his, he will be entitled to a remand of the issue to the district court for a\nhearing to determine whether he can establish these three statutory conditions.\n\n\n       Historically, our Kansas Supreme Court has on three occasions examined this\nstatute when it was dealing with equal protection questions—Denney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508094/state-v-denney/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nSalas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; and Cheeks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Collectively, the opinions give us clear\nguidance on how to proceed in this case. In looking for similarities, the court, at first,\nexamined the elements of the crimes charged but has since moved on to an examination\nof the terms of the different offenders' sentences. Reading these opinions makes it clear\nthat the sentences being served by the offenders are now determinative of our inquiry.\n\n                                                     6\n\f       First, in Denney, the Supreme Court held that K.S.A. 21-2512 violated the Equal\nProtection Clause for offenders convicted of aggravated criminal sodomy involving\npenetration of another female bodily orifice by the male sex organ. 278 Kan. at 649-61.\nThe court entertained the question for the first time on appeal as it was not raised in\nDenney's pro se motion to the district court.\n\n\n       The Denney court focused on the similarity of the elements between the crimes of\nrape and aggravated criminal sodomy under the facts of that case and found no rational\nbasis for differing treatment existed. The court concluded that Denney committed his\ncrime by penetrating his victims' anuses with his male sex organ, a crime the court found\nto be arguably indistinguishable from an offender convicted of rape by penetrating a\nfemale sex organ with his male sex organ. 278 Kan. at 653-54. Going further, the court\nrejected arguments that a rational basis for differing treatment could be based on the cost\nof testing or the differential of the severity levels of rape and criminal sodomy. 278 Kan.\nat 651-56.\n\n\n       To remedy the constitutional violation, the court declined to strike down K.S.A.\n21-2512. Instead, it extended the statute to include postconviction DNA testing for\noffenders in a similar situation as Denney's. Denney, 278 Kan. at 660. Obviously, the\nsimilarity of the criminal acts and elements of the crimes were uppermost in the court's\nanalysis in Denney.\n\n\n       Next, in Salas our Supreme Court again focused on the elements of two crimes—\npremeditated first-degree murder and intentional second-degree murder. Limiting itself to\nconsidering only the offenders that Salas claimed to be similarly situated, the court held\nthat K.S.A. 21-2512 providing postconviction DNA testing if an offender is convicted of\nfirst-degree premeditated murder does not violate equal protection by not extending the\nsame right to offenders convicted of intentional second-degree murder. 289 Kan. at 249-\n51. The court concluded that offenders who commit first-degree murder with\n\n                                                7\n\fpremeditation are not similarly situated to those offenders convicted of intentional\nsecond-degree murder. The difference is the premeditation element, which the court\nconsidered to be a rational basis for differing treatment. 289 Kan. at 250-51.\n\n\n       Finally, in Cheeks the court addressed the equal protection challenge left\nunanswered in Salas—a challenge not based on the elements of the crimes of second-\ndegree murder and first-degree premeditated murder, but based on the punishment\nimposed for both crimes. Because Cheeks framed his \"similarly situated\" analysis on the\npunishment imposed for the crime—not the elements of the crime or the conduct that\nviolates those elements—Salas did not control the court's decision in Cheeks. 298 Kan. at\n6.\n\n\n       Instead, the court held that because Cheeks received the maximum indeterminate\nsentence of 15 years to life for second-degree murder, he was similarly situated to\noffenders convicted of first-degree premeditated murder who received a life sentence.\nThose offenders were also parole eligible after 15 years, but they could petition for\npostconviction DNA testing under K.S.A. 21-2512. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 7. The court,\nciting Denney, concluded no rational basis existed for the differing treatment of similarly\nsituated offenders under K.S.A. 21-2512. The court once again found the statute was\nunconstitutional and expanded the statute to include those offenders convicted of second-\ndegree murder and receiving the presentencing guidelines maximum penalty of 15-years-\nto-life imprisonment. Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8-13.\n\n\nHow Kelsey frames his argument is important to our inquiry.\n\n\n       Kelsey asks us to expand K.S.A. 21-2512 to those offenders convicted under\nK.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A). He cites Cheeks for support. He contends the similarly situated\nclass is defined by the sentence received:\n\n\n                                             8\n\f               \"[Kelsey's] conviction for aggravated indecent liberties . . . places him in a\n       strikingly similar position for length of sentence comparison, relative to those individuals\n       convicted of rape and aggravated criminal sodomy, just as Mr. Cheeks' sentence for\n       second degree murder placed him in a similar position relative to those serving sentences\n       for first degree murder.\"\n\n\n       In setting these narrow limits, Kelsey is arguing that offenders who receive a\nmandatory hard 25 life sentence under K.S.A. 21-4643 for committing aggravated\nindecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 in violation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A)\nare similarly situated to individuals sentenced for rape under K.S.A. 21-3502 and\naggravated criminal sodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506. Thus, because Kelsey is framing the\nrelevant distinction for our \"similarly situated\" analysis on the sentence the district court\nimposed, not the elements of the crimes or the conduct violating those elements, Cheeks\ncontrols our decision in this case.

We have found no indication of an intention to depart.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we must decide whether Kelsey has met the threshold requirement\nby proving he is similarly situated to a group covered under the statute. See Cheeks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. ¶ 2. We hold he has done so.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fA review of the sentencing statutes is helpful.\n\n\n       A person 18 or older convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under\nthe age of 14 in violation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A) is guilty of an off-grid person\nfelony requiring a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years.\nK.S.A. 21-4643(a)(1)(C). Rape and aggravated criminal sodomy are similarly off-grid\nperson felonies when the victim is under the age of 14 and the offender is 18 years of age\nor older. K.S.A. 21-3502(c); K.S.A. 21-3506(c). Therefore, an offender 18 years of age or\nolder convicted under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2) also\nreceives a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years. K.S.A. 21-\n4643(a)(1)(B), (D).\n\n\n       The length of sentences imposed for a conviction under the remaining categories\nof rape and aggravated criminal sodomy vary with the criminal history of the offender. A\nperson convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(1) or (a)(2) is guilty of a severity level\n1 person felony, except, as provided above, under subsection (a)(2) when the offender is\n18 years of age or older, whereas rape as described under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(3) or (a)(4)\nis a severity level 2 person felony. K.S.A. 21-3502(c). And, except as provided above, all\nother convictions for aggravated criminal sodomy are severity level 1 person felonies.\nK.S.A. 21-3506(c). Therefore, a severity level 1 rape/aggravated criminal sodomy\nconviction and a severity level 2 rape conviction has a presumptive sentencing range\nfrom 117 months and 155 months respectively for criminal history category I at the low\nend of the sentencing grid, to 467 months and 620 months respectively for criminal\nhistory category A at the high end. See K.S.A. 21-4704(a).\n\n\n       Given these vast sentencing ranges that are dependent upon an offender's criminal\nhistory, it could be argued that a person sentenced under K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A) is not\nsimilarly situated to certain individuals requesting postconviction DNA testing after\nbeing sentenced for rape or aggravated criminal sodomy at the high end of the sentencing\n\n                                             10\n\fgrid—467 or 620 months. On the other hand, K.S.A. 21-2512 does permit postconviction\nDNA testing for offenders receiving considerably less than the sentence for an off-grid\nperson felony under K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(3)(A).\n\n\n       More importantly, when a district court imposes the mandatory off-grid sentence\nfor a Jessica's Law conviction of aggravated indecent liberties in violation of K.S.A. 21-\n3504(a)(3)(A), the offender who is 18 years of age or older receives the identical\nsentence as if convicted of rape under K.S.A. 21-3502(a)(2) or aggravated criminal\nsodomy under K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) or (a)(2).\n\n\n       Staying within the limits set by Kelsey's argument, we hold that the narrow class\nof offenders sentenced under Jessica's Law for aggravated indecent liberties with a child\nunder the age of 14 are similarly situated to offenders sentenced for rape or aggravated\ncriminal sodomy and serving hard 25 life sentences. Kelsey has met the threshold\nrequirement.\n\n\n       Moving to the remaining steps of our analysis, since there is no indication our\nSupreme Court is departing from Cheeks, we remain constrained by the court's\nconclusion regarding the rational basis analysis and the remedy for an equal protection\nviolation. See Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8-13.\n\n\n       We employ the rational basis test because that is what the Supreme Court used in\nboth Denney, 278 Kan. at 651-52, and Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8. Therefore, Kelsey must\nmeet his burden by negating \"'\"every conceivable [reasonable] basis which might\nsupport\"' the differing treatment.\" Cheeks, 298 Kan. at 8. Indeed, the Cheeks court\nclarified that in considering the possible rational bases offered, the means and the\nclassification of the statute in question must meet a legitimate legislative goal:\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       \"We do not focus on the legislature's actual rationale for the classification. Rather, we\n       consider whether the legislature could have had a legitimate reason for drawing the\n       challenged classification. [Citation omitted.] To pass the rational basis test, the statute\n       must foster legitimate goals and the means chosen to achieve the state's goals must 'bear a\n       rational relationship to those goals.' [Citation omitted.] In other words, the proffered\n       rational basis must be more than simply a legitimate legislative goal, the '\"'\"classification\n       [must] bear [ ] some reasonable relationship to a valid legislative objective.\"'\"' (Emphasis\n       added.) [Citations omitted.] Put another way, the proffered rational basis must both\n       explain the distinction drawn by the statute between two classes of individuals and be a\n       legitimate legislative objective.\" 298 Kan. at 8.\n\n\n       Kelsey simply cites Cheeks, where the court considered and rejected both the cost\nof the testing and the severity levels of the crimes as reasons to justify excluding second-\ndegree murder. 298 Kan. at 8-9.\n\n\n       We assume that the cost of the DNA testing here would be the same as in Cheeks,\nwhere the court rejected the cost of testing as a legitimate rationale for differing\ntreatment. We do so as well. See 298 Kan. at 9; Denney, 278 Kan. at 654. We focus then\non severity levels.\n\n\n       In the earliest case dealing with this issue—Denney—our Supreme Court in\nsearching for a rational basis sua sponte looked at severity levels of the crimes and\nsuggested, \"the legislature may have intended to allow postconviction DNA testing based\non the severity of the crime.\" 278 Kan. at 654. In examining the differences between a\nseverity level 2 felony for aggravated criminal sodomy and a severity level 1 felony for\nrape by force or fear, the court acknowledged, \"differences in severity level could be a\nrational basis for distinguishing between when [postconviction] DNA testing is allowed\nand when not.\" Denney, 278 Kan. at 655.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f       However, citing K.S.A. 21-4707(a), which provides that \"[c]rimes listed within\neach [severity] level are considered to be relatively equal in severity,\" the court rejected\nthe rational basis of crime severity level given that, in some instances, aggravated\ncriminal sodomy had the same severity level as rape. Denney, 278 Kan. at 655-56.\n\n\n       Then, more recently, in Cheeks, our Supreme Court rejected the State's suggestion\nthat the severity of the crime was a rational basis to exclude second-degree murder from\nK.S.A. 21-2512 for the same reason used in Denney. Citing K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-\n6807(a), the court pointed out that even though first-degree murder was classified as an\noff-grid felony when the legislature enacted K.S.A. 21-2512, the legislature included rape\nas a crime eligible for postconviction DNA testing and that both rape and second-degree\nmurder, both being level 1 or 2 person felonies, were \"'relatively equal in severity.'\"\nCheeks, 298 Kan. at 10. In other words, similar does not mean identical when focusing on\nseverity levels of crimes when making this type of analysis.\n\n\n       We are constrained to follow the ruling in Cheeks. As the Supreme Court did in\nCheeks, we find no legitimate legislative goal that is met by this distinction in severity\nlevels of the crimes for the purpose of an equal protection analysis. Given Kansas'\nobvious commitment to exoneration of the innocent through DNA—both sampling and\nlater testing—and following our Supreme Court's lead in extending K.S.A. 21-2512\nrather than nullifying the statute in such instances as here, we likewise extend K.S.A. 21-\n2512 to include testing for those in the same situation as Kelsey. See Cheeks, 298 Kan. at\n12; Denney, 278 Kan. at 660.\n\n\n       In so holding, we clarify that, like Cheeks, we are not adding a new crime to the\nstatute's coverage but are expanding the statute to cover a much narrower class of\noffenders, i.e., offenders convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the\nage of 14 and sentenced under Jessica's Law to the mandatory hard 25 life sentence.\nSince the district court summarily rejected Kelsey's motion based on the face of the\n\n                                             13\n\fstatute and made no findings regarding the three statutory requirements of K.S.A. 21-\n2512(a), Kelsey is only entitled to a remand to the district court for a hearing to\ndetermine whether he can establish those three statutory requirements. See Cheeks, 298\nKan. at 4.\n\n\n        Reversed and remanded for additional findings.\n\n\n                                              ***\n\n\n        ATCHESON, J., concurring: Jason D. Kelsey has a right to seek DNA testing to\nchallenge his convictions for aggravated indecent liberties with a child because the\nJessica's Law sentence he received makes him materially indistinguishable from\ncriminals statutorily entitled to request such testing under Kansas law. K.S.A. 21-2512.\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution requires that sort of consistency in a state's extension of rights or benefits. I\nagree with Judge Hill's conclusion grounded in the Equal Protection Clause. But the\nKansas courts take an odd approach to analyzing equal protection claims by imposing a\nrequirement that those persons asserting a denial of a government right or benefit first\ndemonstrate they are \"similarly situated\" to those receiving the right or benefit. That\npotentially dispositive threshold test has crept fog-like into our cases on little cat feet. It\nhasn't a basis in generally accepted equal protection jurisprudence, and akin to a morning\nfog, it obscures the landscape to no particularly useful ends and conceivably dangerous\nones.\n\n\n        The Equal Protection Clause prevents state and local governments from treating\ngroups of people differently, whether through legislative enactment or other policies and\npractices, without some justification.

But that is nothing like a potentially dispositive comparison of\nthe groups to decide if they are somehow sufficiently similar.\n\n\n       For the most part, lower courts define the first task in equal protection analysis to\nbe a determination of the applicable degree of scrutiny—to the extent they explicitly\ndescribe the sequencing of the steps at all.

In Denney, the\ncourt considered an equal protection challenge from an individual convicted of\naggravated sodomy who wanted postconviction testing of DNA evidence, although\nK.S.A. 21-2512 granted testing only to persons convicted of rape and murder. The court\nundertook an initial comparison of the elements of aggravated criminal sodomy\napplicable to Denney, pronounced them \"arguably indistinguishable\" from the elements\nof rape, and then extended DNA testing to Denney because the legislative classification\npermitting testing in rape convictions but not convictions for at least some forms of\nsodomy lacked any rational basis. Denney, 278 Kan. at 652-54, 656. The Denney decision\ncited no authority for its \"threshold\" examination of the elements of the crimes as a\nprerequisite to the traditional equal protection analysis. 278 Kan. at 653-54. The\n\n                                              18\n\fcomparison of the statutory elements would have been a significant part of a traditional\nanalysis—if the elements of the crimes were markedly different, that would likely\nprovide a rational basis for the legislature allowing DNA testing for convictions of one\nand not the other.\n\n\n       In outlining the applicable constitutional principles, Denney relies almost\nexclusively on Mudd v. Neosho Memorial Regional Med. Center, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621544/mudd-v-neosho-memorial-regional-med-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621544/mudd-v-neosho-memorial-regional-med-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). But Mudd uses traditional equal protection analysis identifying the level of\nscrutiny and then assessing the appropriateness of the governmental classification in light\nof that standard. 275 Kan. at 197-200. The case does not suggest some preliminary step\nbased on a comparison of the attributes of the constituents in the groups created by the\nclassification.\n\n\n       In Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439, the Court described the Equal Protection Clause as\n\"essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" The\ndescription, however, summarized the purpose of the provision rather than an analytical\ntool for assessing an asserted equal protection violation. The Court, however, did turn\nimmediately to a discussion of those tools and outlined, among other things, rational\nbasis review, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. 473 U.S. at 439-42. But the Court\nnever mentioned a threshold requirement for a comparison establishing substantial\nsimilarity across the governmental classification or how that comparison might be\nundertaken. Nor did it make such a comparison in deciding the equal protection issue.\n\n\n       The Kansas Supreme Court also used a threshold \"similarly situated\" test in In re\nTax Appeal of Weisgerber, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), ostensibly because\nthe Equal Protection Clause prohibits government regulation treating \"'arguably\nindistinguishable' classes of people differently.\" (Quoting Ross v.

But Ross and Reed—like Cleburne—simply summarized\n\n                                             19\n\fthe constitutional right afforded in the Equal Protection Clause and not the analytical\nmethod for evaluating those claims. In fact, the classes can be different in ways having\nnothing to do with the government's purpose in creating the classification itself and\nnonetheless violate the Equal Protection Clause. A classification runs afoul of the\nconstitutional protection if, taking account of the applicable level of scrutiny, the classes\ncreated cannot be fairly distinguished with respect to the benefit bestowed or the burden\nimposed. The Reed decision said as much: \"A classification 'must be reasonable, not\narbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial\nrelation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall\nbe treated alike.'\" 404 U.S. at 76 (quoting Royster Guano Co. v.

Franklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1429594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1429594/injured-workers-of-kansas-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 857, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1429594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1429594/injured-workers-of-kansas-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n                                              20\n\f(1997) (obliquely referring to Smith, 254 Kan. at 321, but citing no other authority).\nThreads of Smith influenced the court in Weisgerber, 285 Kan. at 104, 107. The Kansas\ncourts have hopscotched around in addressing the analytical model for equal protection\nclaims over the past quarter century.\n\n        The Kansas Supreme Court, however, is not alone in that respect. For example,\nsome panels of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit use a\ncomparable \"similarly situated\" test as the initial step in assessing equal protection\nclaims.

If Cleburne, Ross, or Reed actually\nimposed an initial \"similarly situated\" requirement, the Court would have used that\ncriterion in deciding later equal protection cases. But plainly, the Court has not. There\nisn't a hint of such a condition in its decisions. See Armour, 132 S. Ct. at 2079-80; Romer\nv. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The ruling in\nCleburne actually contravenes the notion. 473 U.S. at 447-48 (Although recognizing the\nintellectually disabled \"as a group are indeed different from others not sharing their\nmisfortune,\" the Court found no rational basis for a municipal regulation requiring a\nspecial use permit for a group home for the intellectually disabled when no comparable\napproval was necessary for other communal housing arrangements including\nconvalescent or nursing homes, sororities and fraternities, and boarding houses.).\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       Ultimately, a state court cannot add a potentially dispositive element to federal\nequal protection law any more than it could jettison strict scrutiny or declare sex to be a\nclassification undeserving of heightened review. See State v.

That would be true here. But the added and\npotentially dispositive preliminary step is more than an academic exercise. Depending on\nhow the test is supposed to be applied, it would make a substantive difference in some\ncases. And it necessarily distracts from and confounds a proper evaluation of equal\nprotection claims.\n\n\n       If the similarly situated test applies to the overall characteristics of one class as\ncompared to the overall characteristics of the other class or classes created by a statute or\nother governmental action, the standard would effectively terminate some equal\nprotection claims that ought to go forward. That sort of comparison would be an abstract\none unrelated to the purpose of the governmental classification. At least some of the\nKansas caselaw suggests an abstract comparison. See Salas, 289 Kan. at 251;\nWeisgerber, 285 Kan. at 106.\n\n\n       Under that approach, for example, Cleburne presumably would have come out\ndifferently. As I have indicated, the Court determined that intellectually disabled adults,\nas a group, differed significantly from those with roughly normal intellectual capacity.\nSee Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448. Under the Kansas criteria for analyzing equal protection\nchallenges—assuming the initial comparison to be an abstract one—that should have\nended the case in the city's favor. But, of course, the Court found an equal protection\n\n                                              22\n\fviolation, precluding the city from enforcing its permit requirement against the group\nhome.\n        Similarly, in Heller v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1993), the United States Supreme Court considered an equal protection challenge to\nKentucky's involuntary commitment procedures because, among other differences, they\nimposed a more rigorous standard of proof for committing the mentally ill than for the\nintellectually disabled. The Court recognized substantial differences between the\nmentally ill as a class and the intellectually disabled as a class, particularly concerning\ninstitutional care and treatment. 509 U.S. at 326-28. But that recognition did not\nterminate the case. The Court reviewed the differences in procedure using a rational basis\ntest and found them to be constitutionally permissible under the Equal Protection Clause.\n509 U.S. at 328.\n\n\n        The test would also seem to lead to doubtful results in some equal protection\nclaims challenging sex-based classifications. Suppose, for example, a relatively small\nmunicipality required firefighters to meet specific strength and fitness standards to\ngraduate from the training academy, and few women, even after the training, could do so.\nThe fire chief proposed and the city commission adopted the standards to avoid hiring\nfemale firefighters because they thought it would be bad for departmental cohesiveness\nand would likely require at least some renovation of the fire station's facilities. So the\nmunicipality has a written policy allowing only men between 19 and 26 years old to\napply to be firefighters. A woman files suit attacking the men-only application criterion\nas an equal protection violation. The government regulation plainly creates a disfavored\nclass of women and a favored class of men—with a purpose of denying a benefit to\nwomen based on their sex. But men and women arguably aren't similarly situated. They\nhave demonstrable anatomical differences. And they have significantly different roles in\nthe procreative process. Normatively, men are, in fact, bigger and stronger than women.\nSome women are fitter and stronger than some men, and some (but not very many)\n\n\n                                              23\n\fwomen could meet the municipality's training standards. Arguably, at least, those\ndifferences would be enough to cut off the equal protection claim under the Kansas test.\n\n\n       But doing so would eliminate any consideration of the heightened, intermediate\nscrutiny required for classifications based on sex. The more rigorous equal protection\nreview likely would defeat the municipality's argument that the men-only policy\npromotes administrative convenience and saves costs because few women could meet the\nstrength and fitness requirements even with training, so permitting them to apply at all\nwould be wasteful. The physical requirements themselves could be attacked under the\nheightened standard as a product of intentional discrimination rather than as job-\nappropriate in some rational way. The equal protection claim would be a meritorious\none.[3]\n\n\n       [3]The scenario also violates Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (2012),\nprohibiting employment discrimination based on sex and other protected characteristics.\nBut Title VII claims have a comparatively short limitations period and administrative\nexhaustion requirements that constitutional equal protection claims do not. Title VII also\ndoes not apply to very small employers. So an aggrieved party may have a viable equal\nprotection claim without a companion Title VII claim. Liability issues aside, Title VII\nsignificantly limits noneconomic damages against smaller employers. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981a(a)(1), (b)(3) (2012). There are no comparable caps on damages for equal\nprotection violations by state governmental entities brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n       The Kansas test, then, could short-circuit proper equal protection review and has\nthe potential to prematurely terminate legitimate claims. Moreover, the initial \"similarly\nsituated\" determination seems to be one without an objective or even cognizable measure.\nThat criterion looks to be an empty vessel in which a court can pour whatever it wants.\n\n\n       Even if the similarly situated criterion were to be applied within the context of the\nchallenged governmental classification, so that the nature of the division and its\nostensible purpose inform the determination, the test serves no good purpose. Evaluating\nthe similarities and differences between the classes created by the government action\n\n                                             24\n\fessentially replicates much of what a court is supposed to do under traditional equal\nprotection analysis after establishing the appropriate level of scrutiny. See Armour, 132\nS. Ct. at 2079-82 (Court reviews for rationality city's justifications for change in\nassessing costs of sewer projects, resulting in forgiveness of some property owners'\nunpaid assessments but no refunds to other property owners who had already paid\nassessments); Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 17; Reed, 404 U.S. at 75-76. There is no reason for\na court to take up part of that task before fixing the applicable scrutiny. Doing so, at the\nvery least, fragments the analytical process without lending any clarity or other benefit to\nthe decisionmaking. But in those cases calling for heightened scrutiny, the effect could be\nsignificantly distorting, since the court would be reviewing the impact of the\ngovernmental classification without fully considering whether the differences created are\njustified by especially persuasive reasons.\n\n\n       Today, I am comfortable that we have come to the correct conclusion in applying\nthe Equal Protection Clause to the issue before us. But I would prefer following a path\nless foggy to get there.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f</pre>",
