On August 14, 1970, the action against the PAISD and its Superintendent was severed into a separate suit, and was transferred on change of venue to the Beaumont Division.  Following hearing of the severed suit in the Beaumont Division, the district court on September 15, 1970 issued an order requiring the PAISD \"to develop and maintain a unitary school system.\"  This order further required the PAISD to \"immediately implement\" a student attendance desegregation plan, the details of which were specified in the order; to have the black and white teacher and staff ratio at each school \"substantially the same\" as for the district as a whole, and to follow certain other specifications regarding faculty and staff; and to conduct all future school construction, consolidation, and site selection \"in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school system structure once this desegregation plan is implemented.\"  The order specifies that \"this plan shall be put into effect on September 21, 1970,\" and concludes by stating \"this Court shall retain jurisdiction of this cause.\"  No party appealed the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently nothing further transpired in the case until January 28, 1980, when the United States filed therein its Motion for Supplemental Relief requesting that the district court order the PAISD \"to develop and implement (a student) assignment plan which will fully desegregate the Port Arthur schools\" and \"to assign faculty to schools in compliance with the Court's September 15, 1970 order and the requirements of Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211 (CA 5 1970).\"  The motion alleged in essence that the PAISD was operating essentially as many one-race or virtually one-race schools as it had been prior to the September 15, 1970 order and that, as it was \"a system with a history of segregation,\" it had \"the burden of showing that such assignments are nondiscriminatory.\"  It also alleged that \"unless enjoined by this Court, (the PAISD) will continue to operate a large number of one-race and virtually one-race schools in violation of federal law and the constitutional rights of the students attending those schools\" and that the PAISD since September 1970 \"continued to assign faculty and staff to schools in a manner which deviates from the requirements of this Court's September 15, 1970 order and from the requirements of Singleton ....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After various extensions of time, the PAISD filed its Response to Motion for Supplemental Relief and its Motion to Modify Judgment.  The Response alleged \"it is the position of the PAISD that there is no need for the Court to enter any order as requested by the USA inasmuch as the PAISD has, in a motion of even date, requested the voluntary modification of the Judgment rendered by this Court on September 15, 1970.\"  In its Motion to Modify, PAISD alleged that since 1970 the district's white student population had substantially declined and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In late 1979, the USA made its first demand that the present plan of desegregation be modified....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"For the past ten years, the PAISD has believed itself to be unitary and sees no reason to change this opinion....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Motion for Supplemental Relief filed by the USA has caused the district to subject itself to close scrutiny and has, in that respect, proved most productive.  The district now realizes that the fact that it is unitary should not foreclose the possibility of implementing a new technique designed to provide quality integrated education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAISD further alleged that following the Motion for Supplemental Relief it created a multiracial Citizens Advisory Committee (four blacks, four whites, two Hispanics, one Vietnamese) \"to study the present plan of desegregation for the PAISD and determine whether it should be left intact or modified ...,\" and that the report of this committee recommending certain modifications in the plan if the district were found not to be unitary, was approved by the PAISD Trustees except that the Trustees requested the plan modifications even if the district were found unitary.  The PAISD accordingly requested the district court to modify its September 15, 1970 order to authorize a magnet school program, and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The program should be allowed a minimum of five years to prove itself.  During that period refinements and adjustments will be required.  A yearly evaluation will be submitted to the Court.  At the end of five years, the district will move to obtain a judicial declaration of unitary status.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAISD further requested that the September 15, 1970 order be modified as respects its majority to minority student transfer provisions to require that such transfers be given preference, as opposed to being subject to available space, and also as respects its faculty and staff assignment provisions so as to allow for each school a 10 percent deviation factor from the district-wide racial ratios and so as to exempt a specified school at which all such personnel were volunteers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing on October 8, 9 and 10, 1980 at which the United States and the PAISD presented their respective proposed desegregation plans and a variety of other evidence relating, among other things, to the school system, its facilities and the racial composition of the student body, faculty and staff within the district and at its various schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1981 the district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice and removing it from the court's docket together with a memorandum opinion.  510 F.Supp. 994.  In its opinion the court noted that it had retained jurisdiction of the cause in 1970 \"to ensure that the (1970) plan was promptly and properly implemented,\" that the plan had as its goal a unitary school system and \"was implemented on September 21, 1970.\"  The court further found that the PAISD \"has been and is in full compliance with the 1970 Order insofar as it relates to student assignment.\"  Although it noted there was evidence that racially identifiable schools continue to exist in the district and this could trigger a presumption that such condition was \"due to some intentionally segregative act\" by the PAISD, the court nevertheless found that the PAISD had carried its burden of showing that this was not the case by demonstrating that the existence of predominately one-race schools was caused by factors beyond its control, principally \"white flight.\"  With respect to faculty and staff, the court found that while the PAISD had \"not maintained strict compliance\" with the Singleton ratio, the 1970 order had only required that the ratio in each school be \"substantially\" the same as that district-wide and the PAISD had made a good faith effort to comply.  The court ruled that its 1970 order would be interpreted to allow each school's faculty and staff racial mix to vary from that of the district as a whole by 10 percent for grades below six and 15 percent for grades six and above, with Lamar school, having a special program, being totally exempted.  The court then proceeded to, in effect, approve the PAISD's proposed magnet school program and closing of two specified elementary schools.  In conclusion, the district court found \"the PAISD has been unitary since September 21, 1970\" and that \"since there was no proof that the school district committed any act with segregative intent, the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the motion of the United States.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States appealed the April 1981 order and thereafter this Court granted the motion of the United States for an extension of time to file the required documents on appeal until November 1981 to afford the parties an opportunity to negotiate a settlement.  In November 1981 the United States and the PAISD filed with this Court their joint motion for a prehearing conference, with supporting memorandum brief and stipulation, advising that \"a settlement has been reached\" and that \"after receiving the district court's order the parties reopened settlement negotiations ... (which) produced the attached stipulation, under the terms of which the parties are willing to resolve this litigation\" and requesting a prehearing conference under F.R.A.P. 33.  Such a conference was held by one of the judges of this panel in which attorneys for the United States and for the PAISD participated and advised that they individually and the Justice Department and the PAISD had approved and agreed to the settlement embodied in the stipulation attached to the motion for prehearing conference, that the PAISD was in fact in the process of implementing the settlement and intended to continue implementing it unless and until directed otherwise, and that they believed the district court was in error in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction.  Order was entered upon completion of the prehearing conference directing the parties to file their stipulation and a motion requesting the relief they sought, together with a supporting brief and factual stipulation.  Following additional extension of time these documents were duly filed and are now before the Court for ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A copy of the stipulation is annexed hereto as Exhibit A.  We have analyzed the stipulation and approve it.  It is obviously the result not only of a commendable desire on the part of both parties to resolve their litigation in a manner consistent with vindication of the rights of racial minorities under the Constitution and laws of the United States as well as with the goals of quality education for all students and local control of schools, but also of hard-minded and diligent efforts for the accomplishment of these sometimes difficult ends.  The Justice Department and the PAISD have been in a genuinely adversary posture, and the record before us reflects that the case was vigorously and ably contested by competent counsel on both sides before the district court; there is no hint that the settlement has been motivated by any improper considerations or at the expense of unrepresented persons, and it appears to have been arrived at after mature, deliberate and informed consideration on both sides.  It has been approved by the Department of Justice and the PAISD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a settlement is entitled to a presumption of validity, which ordinarily may be overcome only if its provisions are not within reasonable bounds or are illegal, unconstitutional or against public policy.  See United States v. City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358, 1362 (5th Cir. 1980).  We hold this settlement meets these tests, though we do not thereby \"reach any ultimate conclusions on the issues of fact and law which underlie the merits of the dispute,\" Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977) (quoting City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 456 (2nd Cir. 1974) ), as we recognize that normally a settlement is \"a process of compromise in which, 'in exchange for the saving of cost and elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation,' United States v. Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. 673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 ... rather than an attempt to precisely delineate legal rights.\"  United States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1152 (5th Cir. 1975).  Nor, in the circumstances of this case, is there any reason for us to substitute our \"own judgment as to optimal settlement terms for the judgment of the litigants and their counsel.\"  Armstrong v. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 315 (7th Cir. 1980).  And, obviously, a case may be settled on appeal, and the trial court is not the only level at which settlement may take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedure followed here has been specifically sanctioned in Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 468 F.2d 956 (5th Cir. 1972).  Decisions of this Court have upheld settlements in Title VII cases brought by the United States against local governmental units.  United States v. City of Alexandria, supra; United States v. City of Jackson, supra.  While the instant suit is not under Title VII, we believe that many of the reasons favoring settlement of Title VII cases also apply in the context of a case such as this.  Armstrong v. Board of School Directors, supra.  And it is our opinion that the provisions of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000c-6, under which this action was commenced, requiring the Attorney General to notify the appropriate school board and give it a reasonable time to adjust the matter before instituting suit, indicate that Congress looked with favor on voluntary resolutions of these matters.  See also 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1758.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no jurisdictional impediment to the order of remand requested by the parties.  The September 15, 1970 judgment expressly provided for the retention of jurisdiction, and did so without any hint of modification or limitation.  We cannot accept the district court's April 1981 construction of its earlier judgment that its retention of jurisdiction was merely until September 21, 1970 when the plan was to be (and was) implemented.  No express reservation would have been necessary for the court to retain jurisdiction for that six-day interval.  Moreover, paragraph I of the decretal portion of the September 15, 1970 judgment provides, without material qualification, that the district is ordered \"to develop and maintain a unitary school system \" (emphasis added).  Certainly the plain inference here is that the school district continues to be subject to this provision of the order after its initial full implementation of the detailed plan which the order's subsequent paragraphs described and required to be implemented by September 21, 1970.  Further, paragraph VII of the decretal portion of the September 15, 1970 judgment orders that all school construction, consolidation and site selection \"shall be done in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure once this desegregation plan is implemented\" (emphasis added).  This is an express projection of the order beyond the initial implementation of the specified plan.  The court's retention of jurisdiction is contained in paragraph VIII of its September 15, 1970 judgment, comprises the final substantive provision of that document, and cannot be construed as limited to implementation of the specific student and school assignment provisions which the decree set forth and required to be put in effect by September 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this is the construction which each of the parties put on the order, as both the United States and the PAISD, while still in a distinctly adversary posture as to each other, moved the district court to amend its 1970 judgment and plainly assumed that it had retained jurisdiction to do so.  The PAISD's motion indeed requested the court to continue to retain jurisdiction for an additional five years.  And the district court's April 1981 order in effect is an exercise of jurisdiction, as in substance it approves the PAISD's magnet school concept (which is necessarily somewhat at variance with the attendance provisions of the 1970 judgment), and the closing of two schools and authorizes complete exemption of one school from the faculty and staff racial ratio provision of the 1970 decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, having retained jurisdiction in its 1970 judgment, the district court erred in holding that it was \"without jurisdiction to entertain the motion of the United States.\"  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 584 F.2d 78, 81-82 (5th Cir. 1978).  Without speaking to the question of under what circumstances a district court may err in retaining, or failing to retain, jurisdiction, it is plain that in this type of case it had the power to, and did, retain jurisdiction.  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra, at 81-82.  See Green v. Ferrell, 664 F.2d 1292, 1294 (5th Cir. 1982).  Moreover, it cannot be disputed that the district court had personal jurisdiction of the parties and that United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over suits brought by the Attorney General to enforce the equal protection rights of public school children.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000c-6; 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1706; 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1345.  Neither the district court nor any of the parties have ever suggested that any of the procedural prerequisites to suit by the United States are unmet, and it does not appear that if any are here present they are such as cannot be waived, at least where, as here, there is substantial compliance.  See, e.g., United States v. South Park Independent School District, 566 F.2d 1221, 1225-26 (5th Cir. 1978).  That the United States alleged and presented in good faith what was at the very least a colorable claim of entitlement to the relief it sought cannot be doubted.  See United States v. Texas Education Agency (South Park Independent School District), 647 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 102 S.Ct. 1002, 71 L.Ed.2d 295 (1982).  In these circumstances, questions such as whether in fact and in law the school district was unitary and the purpose, intent or effect of the district's school policies and procedures, relate to the merits of the case and to the issue of whether the United States proved its entitlement to relief, rather than to the jurisdiction of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, there is plainly jurisdiction for the district court on remand to enter amended decrees of the sort involved here incorporating the agreement which the parties have made settling the merits of the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the Joint Motion for Entry of Stipulation is hereby granted, the stipulation of the parties is approved, the April 1981 order of the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas herein is vacated and this case is remanded to the district court.  On remand, the district court is directed to enter such orders as may be necessary to effectuate the stipulation so as to permit the Port Arthur Independent School District, as provided therein, to (1) create magnet schools and magnet programs, (2) alter grade structures, (3) close and consolidate schools, (4) reassign students, (5) redraw attendance zones, (6) provide for majority to minority transfer, (7) integrate faculty assignment, (8) plan for additions to the integration plan in subsequent years, and (9) file reports with the court to account for their actions, with notice provided to the United States.  The district court shall retain jurisdiction for all relevant purposes and specifically to oversee the implementation of the stipulation, shall receive the reports required by the stipulation and, when moved by the parties, enter such proper orders as necessary to resolve disagreements between and objections by the parties, and to generally properly assist implementation.  All previous orders of the district court in this case not inconsistent herewith remain in full force and effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further ordered that, with respect to those portions of the decree that call for the PAISD to take certain action during the portion of the 1981-82 school year after January 1, 1982, the PAISD shall be allowed an enlargement of time, not extending beyond the end of the 1981-82 school year, to the extent, if any, that PAISD's performance of such matters has been materially delayed or hindered by the pendency of this case during the period from January 1, 1982 to the date of this order.  Should any question arise as to any such extension or its duration, the PAISD shall have the burden of demonstrating its entitlement to same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX A</p>\n    <p>STIPULATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties in the cause styled above stipulate to entry of an order in this action which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

Following hearing of the severed suit in the Beaumont Division, the district court on September 15, 1970 issued an order requiring the PAISD \"to develop and maintain a unitary school system.\"  This order further required the PAISD to \"immediately implement\" a student attendance desegregation plan, the details of which were specified in the order; to have the black and white teacher and staff ratio at each school \"substantially the same\" as for the district as a whole, and to follow certain other specifications regarding faculty and staff; and to conduct all future school construction, consolidation, and site selection \"in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school system structure once this desegregation plan is implemented.\"  The order specifies that \"this plan shall be put into effect on September 21, 1970,\" and concludes by stating \"this Court shall retain jurisdiction of this cause.\"  No party appealed the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently nothing further transpired in the case until January 28, 1980, when the United States filed therein its Motion for Supplemental Relief requesting that the district court order the PAISD \"to develop and implement (a student) assignment plan which will fully desegregate the Port Arthur schools\" and \"to assign faculty to schools in compliance with the Court's September 15, 1970 order and the requirements of Singleton v.

The Response alleged \"it is the position of the PAISD that there is no need for the Court to enter any order as requested by the USA inasmuch as the PAISD has, in a motion of even date, requested the voluntary modification of the Judgment rendered by this Court on September 15, 1970.\"  In its Motion to Modify, PAISD alleged that since 1970 the district's white student population had substantially declined and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In late 1979, the USA made its first demand that the present plan of desegregation be modified....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"For the past ten years, the PAISD has believed itself to be unitary and sees no reason to change this opinion....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Motion for Supplemental Relief filed by the USA has caused the district to subject itself to close scrutiny and has, in that respect, proved most productive.  The district now realizes that the fact that it is unitary should not foreclose the possibility of implementing a new technique designed to provide quality integrated education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAISD further alleged that following the Motion for Supplemental Relief it created a multiracial Citizens Advisory Committee (four blacks, four whites, two Hispanics, one Vietnamese) \"to study the present plan of desegregation for the PAISD and determine whether it should be left intact or modified ...,\" and that the report of this committee recommending certain modifications in the plan if the district were found not to be unitary, was approved by the PAISD Trustees except that the Trustees requested the plan modifications even if the district were found unitary.  The PAISD accordingly requested the district court to modify its September 15, 1970 order to authorize a magnet school program, and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The program should be allowed a minimum of five years to prove itself.  During that period refinements and adjustments will be required.  A yearly evaluation will be submitted to the Court.  At the end of five years, the district will move to obtain a judicial declaration of unitary status.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAISD further requested that the September 15, 1970 order be modified as respects its majority to minority student transfer provisions to require that such transfers be given preference, as opposed to being subject to available space, and also as respects its faculty and staff assignment provisions so as to allow for each school a 10 percent deviation factor from the district-wide racial ratios and so as to exempt a specified school at which all such personnel were volunteers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing on October 8, 9 and 10, 1980 at which the United States and the PAISD presented their respective proposed desegregation plans and a variety of other evidence relating, among other things, to the school system, its facilities and the racial composition of the student body, faculty and staff within the district and at its various schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1981 the district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice and removing it from the court's docket together with a memorandum opinion.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></span>.  In its opinion the court noted that it had retained jurisdiction of the cause in 1970 \"to ensure that the (1970) plan was promptly and properly implemented,\" that the plan had as its goal a unitary school system and \"was implemented on September 21, 1970.\"  The court further found that the PAISD \"has been and is in full compliance with the 1970 Order insofar as it relates to student assignment.\"  Although it noted there was evidence that racially identifiable schools continue to exist in the district and this could trigger a presumption that such condition was \"due to some intentionally segregative act\" by the PAISD, the court nevertheless found that the PAISD had carried its burden of showing that this was not the case by demonstrating that the existence of predominately one-race schools was caused by factors beyond its control, principally \"white flight.\"  With respect to faculty and staff, the court found that while the PAISD had \"not maintained strict compliance\" with the Singleton ratio, the 1970 order had only required that the ratio in each school be \"substantially\" the same as that district-wide and the PAISD had made a good faith effort to comply.  The court ruled that its 1970 order would be interpreted to allow each school's faculty and staff racial mix to vary from that of the district as a whole by 10 percent for grades below six and 15 percent for grades six and above, with Lamar school, having a special program, being totally exempted.  The court then proceeded to, in effect, approve the PAISD's proposed magnet school program and closing of two specified elementary schools.  In conclusion, the district court found \"the PAISD has been unitary since September 21, 1970\" and that \"since there was no proof that the school district committed any act with segregative intent, the Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the motion of the United States.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States appealed the April 1981 order and thereafter this Court granted the motion of the United States for an extension of time to file the required documents on appeal until November 1981 to afford the parties an opportunity to negotiate a settlement.  In November 1981 the United States and the PAISD filed with this Court their joint motion for a prehearing conference, with supporting memorandum brief and stipulation, advising that \"a settlement has been reached\" and that \"after receiving the district court's order the parties reopened settlement negotiations ... (which) produced the attached stipulation, under the terms of which the parties are willing to resolve this litigation\" and requesting a prehearing conference under F.R.A.P. 33.  Such a conference was held by one of the judges of this panel in which attorneys for the United States and for the PAISD participated and advised that they individually and the Justice Department and the PAISD had approved and agreed to the settlement embodied in the stipulation attached to the motion for prehearing conference, that the PAISD was in fact in the process of implementing the settlement and intended to continue implementing it unless and until directed otherwise, and that they believed the district court was in error in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction.  Order was entered upon completion of the prehearing conference directing the parties to file their stipulation and a motion requesting the relief they sought, together with a supporting brief and factual stipulation.  Following additional extension of time these documents were duly filed and are now before the Court for ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A copy of the stipulation is annexed hereto as Exhibit A.  We have analyzed the stipulation and approve it.  It is obviously the result not only of a commendable desire on the part of both parties to resolve their litigation in a manner consistent with vindication of the rights of racial minorities under the Constitution and laws of the United States as well as with the goals of quality education for all students and local control of schools, but also of hard-minded and diligent efforts for the accomplishment of these sometimes difficult ends.  The Justice Department and the PAISD have been in a genuinely adversary posture, and the record before us reflects that the case was vigorously and ably contested by competent counsel on both sides before the district court; there is no hint that the settlement has been motivated by any improper considerations or at the expense of unrepresented persons, and it appears to have been arrived at after mature, deliberate and informed consideration on both sides.  It has been approved by the Department of Justice and the PAISD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a settlement is entitled to a presumption of validity, which ordinarily may be overcome only if its provisions are not within reasonable bounds or are illegal, unconstitutional or against public policy.

Decisions of this Court have upheld settlements in Title VII cases brought by the United States against local governmental units.  United States v. City of Alexandria, supra; United States v. City of Jackson, supra.  While the instant suit is not under Title VII, we believe that many of the reasons favoring settlement of Title VII cases also apply in the context of a case such as this.  Armstrong v. Board of School Directors, supra.  And it is our opinion that the provisions of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000c-6, under which this action was commenced, requiring the Attorney General to notify the appropriate school board and give it a reasonable time to adjust the matter before instituting suit, indicate that Congress looked with favor on voluntary resolutions of these matters.  See also 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1758.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no jurisdictional impediment to the order of remand requested by the parties.  The September 15, 1970 judgment expressly provided for the retention of jurisdiction, and did so without any hint of modification or limitation.  We cannot accept the district court's April 1981 construction of its earlier judgment that its retention of jurisdiction was merely until September 21, 1970 when the plan was to be (and was) implemented.  No express reservation would have been necessary for the court to retain jurisdiction for that six-day interval.  Moreover, paragraph I of the decretal portion of the September 15, 1970 judgment provides, without material qualification, that the district is ordered \"to develop and maintain a unitary school system \" (emphasis added).  Certainly the plain inference here is that the school district continues to be subject to this provision of the order after its initial full implementation of the detailed plan which the order's subsequent paragraphs described and required to be implemented by September 21, 1970.  Further, paragraph VII of the decretal portion of the September 15, 1970 judgment orders that all school construction, consolidation and site selection \"shall be done in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure once this desegregation plan is implemented\" (emphasis added).  This is an express projection of the order beyond the initial implementation of the specified plan.  The court's retention of jurisdiction is contained in paragraph VIII of its September 15, 1970 judgment, comprises the final substantive provision of that document, and cannot be construed as limited to implementation of the specific student and school assignment provisions which the decree set forth and required to be put in effect by September 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this is the construction which each of the parties put on the order, as both the United States and the PAISD, while still in a distinctly adversary posture as to each other, moved the district court to amend its 1970 judgment and plainly assumed that it had retained jurisdiction to do so.  The PAISD's motion indeed requested the court to continue to retain jurisdiction for an additional five years.  And the district court's April 1981 order in effect is an exercise of jurisdiction, as in substance it approves the PAISD's magnet school concept (which is necessarily somewhat at variance with the attendance provisions of the 1970 judgment), and the closing of two schools and authorizes complete exemption of one school from the faculty and staff racial ratio provision of the 1970 decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, having retained jurisdiction in its 1970 judgment, the district court erred in holding that it was \"without jurisdiction to entertain the motion of the United States.\"  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359767\"><a href=\"/opinion/359767/anthony-t-lee-v-macon-county-board-of-education-baldwin-county-board-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 81-82 (5th Cir. 1978).  Without speaking to the question of under what circumstances a district court may err in retaining, or failing to retain, jurisdiction, it is plain that in this type of case it had the power to, and did, retain jurisdiction.  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra, at 81-82.  See Green v. Ferrell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397205\"><a href=\"/opinion/397205/tyrone-green-john-h-owens-jr-etc-movant-appellant-v-william-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span></a></span>, 1294 (5th Cir. 1982).  Moreover, it cannot be disputed that the district court had personal jurisdiction of the parties and that United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over suits brought by the Attorney General to enforce the equal protection rights of public school children.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000c-6; 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1706; 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1345.  Neither the district court nor any of the parties have ever suggested that any of the procedural prerequisites to suit by the United States are unmet, and it does not appear that if any are here present they are such as cannot be waived, at least where, as here, there is substantial compliance.  See, e.g., United States v. South Park Independent School District, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351523\"><a href=\"/opinion/351523/united-states-v-south-park-independent-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>, 1225-26 (5th Cir. 1978).  That the United States alleged and presented in good faith what was at the very least a colorable claim of entitlement to the relief it sought cannot be doubted.  See United States v. Texas Education Agency (South Park Independent School District), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389967\"><a href=\"/opinion/389967/united-states-v-texas-education-agency-south-park-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In these circumstances, questions such as whether in fact and in law the school district was unitary and the purpose, intent or effect of the district's school policies and procedures, relate to the merits of the case and to the issue of whether the United States proved its entitlement to relief, rather than to the jurisdiction of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, there is plainly jurisdiction for the district court on remand to enter amended decrees of the sort involved here incorporating the agreement which the parties have made settling the merits of the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the Joint Motion for Entry of Stipulation is hereby granted, the stipulation of the parties is approved, the April 1981 order of the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas herein is vacated and this case is remanded to the district court.
