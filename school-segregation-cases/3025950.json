GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n      Lillie Wheat, a former Juvenile Detention Staff Officer (“JDS Officer”)\nwith the Florida Parishes Juvenile Justice Commission (“the Commission”),\nappeals from the district court’s summary-judgment dismissal of her\nemployment-discrimination suit.             We AFFIRM in part, and VACATE and\nREMAND in part.\n                                               I.\n      In 2000, Wheat began her employment with the Commission, which\noperates the Florida Parishes Juvenile Detention Center (“FPJDC”) in the\n\n\n\n      *   District Judge of the Southern District of Mississippi, sitting by designation.\n\f    Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552   Page: 2   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\nEastern District of Louisiana. Wheat was eventually promoted to JDS officer,\nthen to Shift Supervisor in 2005, and ultimately to Assistant Director of\nFemale Services in 2008. Additionally, she had received positive reviews and\nconsistent pay raises. In January 2005, however, Wheat was disciplined after\nshe used excessive force against a juvenile inmate. By failing to defuse a\nhostile situation with the juvenile, or alert other JDS officers, Wheat had\nallowed the juvenile to get within her reach. Wheat then physically forced the\njuvenile down to the ground and held her there, violating FPJDC’s guidelines.\n      In 2009, Wheat took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act\n(“FMLA”), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., to undergo surgery. The Commission\nterminated her employment for failing to return to work after her FMLA leave\nhad expired. She filed suit under the FMLA. The suit was settled, and her\nemployment at the Commission was reinstated on March 8, 2011. At the time,\nher previous position as Assistant Director of Female Services was not\navailable. Consequently, she was hired at a lower ranking position as a JDS\nOfficer. However, she was paid the same salary as her previous supervisory\nposition. After being rehired, supervisory positions became available and, on\ntwo separate occasions, she was offered advancement to a supervisory position.\nWheat turned down both offers because “she did not want to go back on salary\nand assume additional responsibility,” and “she would lose her right to\novertime.”\n      On November 23, 2011, Wheat filed an “Unusual Occurrence Report”\nconcerning a twelve-year-old female inmate’s alleged inappropriate sexual\nadvances toward Wheat.        Wheat’s supervisors met with her on several\noccasions to discuss the proper methods for handling such advances. Wheat\nwas dissatisfied with the disciplinary limitations which these models imposed.\nShe requested that the juvenile be placed in administrative segregation. Her\nrequests were denied.\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552    Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-30788\n      On January 3, 2012, Wheat had another physical episode with a female\ninmate. Responding to the juvenile’s noncompliant behavior, Wheat applied a\n“mandibular angle pressure point” hold to the juvenile. Wheat was ordered to\ncease, and her supervisor had to restrain her. Wheat then had to be restrained\na second time. Wheat followed the same juvenile to her cell, and although\nprovoked by the juvenile, further attempted to assault her. Wheat threatened\nto “whip that bitch’s ass.” Wheat was placed on leave, without pay, for these\ntwo eruptions and was shortly thereafter discharged, on January 19, 2012.\n      After exhausting her remedies with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5, Wheat filed this suit. In her\ncomplaint, she alleged that she was discharged in retaliation for having\nasserted her rights under the FMLA, and under Title VII (for having\ncomplained about the juvenile’s sexual advances).        She also alleged ten\nadditional retaliatory acts by the Commission, as well as sexual harassment\nby the juvenile resident. The district court granted summary judgment to the\nCommission, dismissing Wheat’s complaint.         Wheat v. Florida Parishes\nJuvenile Justice Comm'n, No. 12-2989, 2014 WL 2155239 (E.D. La. May 22,\n2014).\n                                      II.\n      We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same\nstandard as did the district court. E.g., Cuellar v. Keppel Amfels, L.L.C., 731\nF.3d 342, 345 (5th Cir. 2013). Under that standard, summary judgment is\nappropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n                                     III.\n      It is important to keep in mind that the FPJDC facility is a correctional\nconfinement, primarily for youths who are emotionally challenged, exhibit\n                                      3\n\f    Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552     Page: 4   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\ndrug and alcohol problems, mental problems, and suicidal tendencies, which\nrequires supervisors and employees with specialized training and self-control.\n      The FMLA and Title VII prohibit an employer from discriminating\nagainst employees for asserting rights protected under those acts. See 29\nU.S.C. § 2615 (forbidding “discriminat[ion] against any individual because\nsuch individual,” among other things, “has filed any charge . . . under or related\nto” the FMLA); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (forbidding “discriminat[ion] against” an\nemployee or job applicant because that individual “opposed any practice” made\nunlawful by Title VII or “made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in”\na Title VII proceeding or investigation).\n      Wheat does not connect any of the alleged acts of retaliation to a specific\nprotected right, that is, whether the retaliation was under Title VII and/or the\nFMLA. Retaliation claims under both Title VII and the FMLA, however, are\nanalyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Chaffin\nv. John H. Carter Co., 179 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir. 1999); see also Hunt v.\nRapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, 277 F.3d 757, 768 (5th Cir. 2001).            That\nframework requires the employee first to set out a prima facie case of\nretaliation, which she may do by establishing that: (1) she engaged in protected\nactivity; (2) the employer took a materially adverse action against her; and (3)\na causal link exists between her protected activity and the adverse action. See,\ne.g., Davis v. Fort Bend Cnty., 765 F.3d 480, 489–90 (5th Cir. 2014) (Title VII),\ncert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 2804 (2015); Ion v. Chevron USA, Inc., 731 F.3d 379,\n390 (5th Cir. 2013) (FMLA). The Supreme Court, however, in Univ. of Texas\nSw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517 (2013), recently held that to satisfy\nthe “causal link” requirement of a Title VII retaliation claim, the employee\nmust provide substantial evidence that “but for” exercising protected rights,\nshe would not have been discharged. See id. at 2533 (“Title VII retaliation\nclaims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation .\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552        Page: 5     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-30788\n. . [t]his requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred\nin the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.”).\nNeither this Court, nor the Supreme Court, has decided whether the\nheightened “but for” causation standard required for Title VII retaliation\nclaims applies with equal force to FMLA retaliation claims. See Harrelson v.\nLufkin Indus., Inc., No. 14-41458, 2015 WL 3941905, at *3 (5th Cir. June 29,\n2015) (“We have yet to decide whether Nassar applies to the FMLA context.”);\nCastay v. Ochsner Clinic Found., 604 F. App'x 355, 356 (5th Cir. 2015)\n(“Because we concluded that the plaintiff's claim in that case would fail under\neither [Title VII or FMLA] standard, we did not decide whether the ‘but for’\ncausation standard should apply in FMLA retaliation cases.”); Ion, 731 F.3d at\n390 (“We emphasize that we need not, and do not, decide whether Nassar 's\nanalytical approach applies to FMLA-retaliation claims and, if so, whether it\nrequires a plaintiff to prove but-for causation.”).           Even so, however, this\ndistinction is largely immaterial because the claims addressed below—with the\nexception of the termination and harassment claims—turn on the “materially\nadverse action” prong of McDonnell Douglas.\n                                            A.\n      Wheat alleges that, before her termination, the Commission retaliated\nagainst her on several occasions. Reasoning that only “ultimate employment\ndecisions” can constitute actionable retaliation, the district court held that\nWheat had failed to make out a prima-facie case. Wheat, 2014 WL 2155239 at\n*5–8. On appeal, the parties, as well as the EEOC as amicus, argue that the\ndistrict court erred by applying our pre-Burlington Northern & Santa Fe\nRailway v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), standard to Wheat’s claims. 1\n\n\n      1 Before the Supreme Court’s decision in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway v.\nWhite, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), this Court held that only “‘ultimate employment decisions,’ such\nas hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating, satisfy the ‘adverse\n                                            5\n\f       Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552         Page: 6     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nNonetheless, the Commission argues that it is still entitled to summary\njudgment because none of the alleged pre-termination actions rises to the level\nof actionable retaliation under Burlington.              We turn, then, to determine\nwhether these retaliation claims survive summary judgment under current\nlaw.\n        We have examined these various retaliation claims and find that most\nare unsupported by the record and are devoid of merit. We do find that three\nof these claims merit further discussion: the assignment of “janitorial duties”\nupon her rehiring; the denial of a 4% raise as indicated by her performance\nevaluation; and the denial of her request to be transferred away from a\n“difficult inmate.” 2\n                                             1.\n        First, Wheat alleges that an assignment of janitorial duties was a\nretaliatory, materially adverse action. Such an allegation, however, must do\nmore than make conclusory allegations to create a cognizable issue of fact. See,\ne.g., Navarro v. City of San Juan, No. 14-41410, 2015 WL 5049911, at *3 (5th\nCir. Aug. 27, 2015) (“The nonmovant's burden ‘is not satisfied with some\nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by\nunsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence.’”) (citation\nomitted); Davis, 765 F.3d at 484 (“A party cannot ‘defeat summary judgment\n\n\n\nemployment action’ element of a prima facie case of retaliation.” E.g., Hunt, 277 F.3d at 769\n(emphasis omitted).\n        2Wheat raises other issues on appeal including: being transferred to work with\nfemales; being bitten by a female resident; being denied medical information about the\nresident who bit her; being “denied support by [her] supervisors in difficult situations with”\nresidents; being sexually harassed by a female resident; being “denied support of on the scene\nstaff in physical confrontations with” residents; and being denied a timely performance\nevaluation. After thorough review, it is clear that Wheat provides no record support for any\nof these pre-termination “materially adverse action” allegations in connection with her\nasserted Title VII and FMLA rights.\n\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552    Page: 7   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\nwith conclusory allegations . . . .’”); Browning v. Sw. Research Inst., 288 F.\nApp'x 170, 173 (5th Cir. 2008) (“[T]he nonmoving party ‘must . . . set out specific\nfacts showing a genuine issue for trial.’ The nonmoving party, however, ‘cannot\nsatisfy this burden with conclusory allegations.’”) (citation omitted); Michalik\nv. Hermann, 422 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir. 2005) (“The plaintiff bears the burden\nof negating the defense and cannot rest on conclusory allegations and\nassertions but must demonstrate genuine issues of material fact . . . .”); Geter\nv. Fortenberry, 849 F.2d 1550, 1553 (5th Cir. 1988) (“[C]omplaints containing\nconclusory allegations, absent reference to material facts, will not survive\nmotions to dismiss.”).\n      A bare-bones allegation that an assignment of janitorial duties is a\nmaterially adverse action is only an unsupported conclusory claim. Such a\nbare allegation fails to provide the contextual detail that is required for\nmaterially adverse actions. In Burlington, 548 U.S. 53, 69, the Supreme Court\nmade clear that context is critical. The Court observed that “[w]hether a\nparticular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances\nof the particular case.” Id. at 71. Those circumstances are missing here.\nIndeed, Burlington illustrated that merely changing an employee’s job title will\nnot suffice to constitute a materially adverse action without further detail. Id.\nat 70–71. The Court reasoned that the record evidence indicated that the\nplaintiff was reassigned to perform “only standard track laborer tasks,” “that\nthe track laborer duties were by all accounts more arduous and dirtier,” and\n“that the forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an\nindication of prestige.” Id. at 58, 71 (emphasis added) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).      “Based on this record,” the Court said, “a jury could\nreasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been\nmaterially adverse to a reasonable employee.” Id. at 71 (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, there is no record evidence that\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552       Page: 8   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-30788\nprovides any description, whatsoever, of Wheat’s alleged temporary\nassignment of janitorial duties.\n      Furthermore, Wheat can find no succor in Wilson v. Monarch Paper Co.,\n939 F.2d 1138 (5th Cir. 1991).       There, the employer had reassigned the\nplaintiff—a former “executive manager”—to a position as “an entry level\nwarehouse supervisor with menial and demeaning duties.” Id. at 1145. We\nupheld the jury’s finding that this conduct was “extreme and outrageous,”\npointing to record evidence regarding the plaintiff’s qualifications (he “had\nbeen a long-time executive” with the employer and was “responsible for the\nlargest project in the company’s history,” which he completed “on time and\nunder budget”); the specific nature of the plaintiff’s duties as warehouse\nsupervisor (he “was frequently required to sweep the warehouse” and “was\nreduced to cleaning up after the employees in the warehouse cafeteria after\ntheir lunch hour”); and the extent to which his work time was occupied with\nthe menial tasks (“Wilson spent 75 percent of his time performing these\nmenial, janitorial duties.”). Id. at 1145–46. Wilson also had to perform all of\nhis janitorial duties under a sign that read “Wilson is old.” Id. There is no\nrecord here that provides any suggestion of Wheat’s duties, time spent, or the\nhumiliation, if any, that she suffered.\n      Furthermore, nowhere in her complaint does Wheat allege why\nassignment to janitorial duties was an act of retaliation or an adverse\nemployment action. Before the district court, she alleged “Wheat was initially\nassigned to perform janitorial work and do intake. A few weeks later, Wheat\nwas assigned to Echo Mod which houses male juveniles. In late April, early\nMay, 2011, Wheat was notified by Donald Carter, Shift Supervisor, that she\nwas being re-assigned to the girls’ mod.” Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontested\nFact, Doc. 40-1, ¶16.     This statement is the complete reference to her\nassignment of janitorial duties that can be found in the record before the\n                                          8\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552      Page: 9     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\ndistrict court.   Nothing more.   There is no indication that she raised the\nslightest objection to this assignment. There is no indication of how much time\nwas spent doing these “janitorial duties” as opposed to doing “intake” work.\nThe district court was never told whether she was asked to perform unpleasant\n“janitorial tasks” (e.g., cleaning bathrooms), “janitorial tasks” that were minor\nin nature (e.g., changing lightbulbs, dusting a few desks, or simply cleaning up\nher own desk), or, indeed, whether her tasks could reasonably be classified as\njanitorial at all. Nor was the district court told what portion of Wheat’s work\nday was devoted to “janitorial duties.”     Was it all of her workday (as in\nBurlington, 548 U.S. at 58), 75 percent of her workday (as in Wilson, 939 F.2d\nat 1145), less than 5 minutes per week, or any part of her workday at all?\nNeither the district court nor we have the slightest idea.\n      Moreover, the dissent says that on appeal “the Commission admits that\njanitorial duties were not ‘regular’ duties of line officers.”        This alleged\nstatement was never made before the district court; nor was it ever made by\nWheat at any time. To be sure, the dissent mischaracterizes the Commission’s\nbrief in this respect. The Commission actually said:\n      Moreover, Ms. Wheat has not offered any evidence that her being\n      assigned such chores constituted different treatment from other\n      JDS officers. Ms. Wheat offers no evidence that this short\n      assignment of janitorial and intake duties was anything more than\n      her supervisors finding work for her until regular JDS officer\n      duties became available. This is a legitimate, non-retaliatory\n      motivation. Applying the correct standard to these facts, it\n      becomes apparent that this temporary assignment falls far short\n      of being materially adverse to a reasonable employee in Ms.\n      Wheat’s position.\nAppellee’s Brief, p. 14–15. Properly read, the record does not exclude the\npossibility that some “janitorial duties” were expected of JDS officers\ngenerally—but especially those, like Wheat, who had just recently been hired\nor reinstated.\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 14-30788   Document: 00513329552      Page: 10   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\n      In sum, Wheat’s mere assignment of janitorial duties, without further\ndescription or detail about what those duties actually were, does not state a\nmaterially adverse action under Burlington or Wilson. In short, she has failed\nto meet her burden of making a prima facie case of retaliation.\n                                       2.\n      Next, Wheat alleges that her performance evaluation was untimely and\nthat “[a]ccording to the evaluation, [she] should have received a 4% pay\nincrease.” Although Wheat’s performance evaluation form rated her Overall\nJob Performance Rating as “Very Good”, the form clearly stated that she was\nnot authorized for a step increase. More importantly, at the conclusion of her\nperformance review, Wheat signed the findings of the review committee as\nfollows:\n      I have read this evaluation and reviewed a copy of it. I understand\n      that my signature does not constitute or imply my agreement,\n      unless marked so. Should I disagree with this rating, I understand\n      that I my [sic] appeal to the appropriate manager.\nROA.403 (emphasis added).\n      Wheat also checked the box that read “I have reviewed and agree with\nthis rating.” Id. She did not object to or appeal this evaluation. Further, the\nrecord is silent as to why she did not elect to appeal. In short, Wheat produced\nno evidence to show that the delay in her evaluation or the failure to grant her\n4% step increase—accompanied by a right of appeal that she did not exercise—\nconstituted a materially adverse action.\n      The dissent concludes that it “may be materially adverse when an\nemployee is effectively denied (or delayed by several months) a 4% raise\nindicated by her performance evaluation.” (Emphasis added).           Thus, the\ndissent, by the use of the word “may”, seems to acknowledge that Wheat has\nfailed to meet her burden of establishing her claim. Furthermore, the dissent\nasserts that a disputed issue of material fact exists based on the possibility\n                                      10\n\f    Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552         Page: 11   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-30788\nthat the Commission’s action “may be materially adverse when an employee is\neffectively denied . . . a 4% raise indicated by her performance evaluation.”\n(Emphasis added). Even so, as previously indicated, the dissent’s premise is\nwrong on the record facts. This possibility is not enough to create a material\nfact or issue of law that bars summary judgment, especially when the\nunderlying premise of such “possibility” appears to be false.\n      Therefore, Wheat has failed to meet her burden of making a prima facie\ncase of retaliation for this claim.\n                                           3.\n      Next, Wheat alleges that the denial of a transfer request was a\nretaliatory, materially adverse action.         Specifically, Wheat requested the\ntransfer because she objected to working around one particularly disruptive\njuvenile. As with the janitorial duties, Wheat has presented no evidence that\nthe denial of the reassignment made her job “objectively” worse.                  See\nBurlington, 548 U.S. at 71. It did not “affect[] her job title, grade, hours, salary,\nor benefits,” nor is there any indication that working with females resulted in\na “diminution in prestige or change in standing among her co-workers.” See\nStewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm’n, 586 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir. 2009).\nAdditionally, mere denial of a reassignment to a purely lateral position (“no\nreduction in pay and no more than a minor change in working conditions”), is\ntypically not a materially adverse action. Burger v. Cent. Apartment Mgmt.,\nInc., 168 F.3d 875, 879 (5th Cir. 1999). Furthermore, as the Commission points\nout, Wheat had worked, apparently without complaint, in the female section\nfor eight years.\n      Therefore, under these circumstances, the denial of a reassignment was\nnot, as a matter of law, an adverse action. Accordingly, Wheat has not met her\nburden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation for this claim.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f   Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552         Page: 12   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\n                                 *     *       *\n      Although the district court erroneously evaluated the Commission’s\nallegedly retaliatory actions using the now-abrogated “ultimate employment\ndecisions” standard, Wheat’s pre-termination retaliation claims fail even\nunder current law. Thus, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the Commission with respect to these retaliation claims.\n                                       B.\n      Finally, we turn to Wheat’s retaliatory termination claim. It is clear that\nWheat’s discharge constitutes a “materially adverse action.” See, e.g., Royal v.\nCCC&R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., 736 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir. 2013) (“It is clear that\nan adverse employment action occurred here—Royal was fired.”). We thus\nturn to Wheat’s burden to show a “causal link” between her discharge and\nexercising her protected rights. Again, it unclear whether the “causal link”\nrequirement for FMLA retaliation claims involves the same “but for” analysis\nrequired for Title VII retaliation claims. See Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517. It is\nclear, however, that the plaintiff “may avoid summary judgment on ‘but for’\ncausation by demonstrating ‘a conflict in substantial evidence on this ultimate\nissue.’” Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 670 F.3d 644, 660 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(“Evidence is ‘substantial’ if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable\nand fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach\ndifferent conclusions.”) (citation omitted).   As we shall see, however, here\nwhich standard we apply does not affect the outcome because Wheat’s claim\nsurvives the heightened showing of “but for” causation.           Then, when the\nplaintiff sets out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, “the burden\nshifts to the employer to state a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for” the\nadverse action. Davis, 765 F.3d at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      Initially, however, Wheat, as the plaintiff, bears the burden to provide\nsubstantial evidence for this claim.    Wheat must illustrate that “but for”\n                                       12\n\f   Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552    Page: 13   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-30788\nexercising her Title VII and FMLA protected rights, she would not have been\ndischarged. Wheat effectively acknowledges the conduct with which she was\ncharged, but contends that the actual cause of her termination was that she\nasserted her protected rights. She points to other specific instances in which\nshe, and other employees as well, were physically excessive toward juveniles\nbut not discharged.\n      In this connection, the record shows that Wheat herself was previously\nimproperly excessive in dealing with a juvenile in 2005. At that time she had\nnever asserted Title VII or FMLA rights. Responding to this 2005 incident,\nthe FPJDC’s Operations Manager “recommended three days suspension\nwithout pay and six months [of] probation.” Affidavit of Steven Happel, at 4,\n¶34. The Executive Director, however, “[r]ecognizing Ms. Wheat’s ‘exemplary\njob performance’ . . . reduced the disciplinary action to a written reprimand”\nand required Wheat to “undergo additional training.” Id. at ¶35. But with\nrespect to the 2012 incident, after asserting her Title VII and FMLA rights,\nthe Commission terminated Wheat’s employment because, it said, “No JDS\nofficer had ever physically attacked a youth resident before Ms. Wheat did,\nand, no JDS officer was allowed to remain in the Commission's employ after\nany such attack.” Defendant’s Amended Statement of Uncontested Fact, Doc.\n39, ¶72. Wheat rebutted this assertion by offering evidence of other employees\nwho were violent towards juvenile residents, but were not discharged by the\nCommission. See Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontested Fact, Doc. 40-1, ¶72. It\nwas only after Wheat brought these allegations of the Commission’s disparate\ntreatment of its employees to the attention of the district court, that the\nCommission modified its reasons for termination. In its revised explanation\nfor her discharge, the Commission asserted that Wheat’s second “violent attack\non a youth resident . . . gave the Commission compelling grounds to fire her to\nprotect the health and safety of the youth residents.” Defendant’s Second\n                                      13\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552          Page: 14     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nReply Memo, Doc. 46, at 9.            After providing its revised explanation, the\nCommission did not make any reference, corrective or otherwise, to its original\nnon-retaliatory explanation for discharging Wheat (“[n]o JDS officer [] ever\nphysically attacked a youth . . . [or was] allowed to remain in the Commission's\nemploy after any such attack”). 3 In other words, the grounds for Wheat’s\ndischarge related solely to the incidents of January 3, 2012, immediately\npreceding her discharge. In this light, the Commission offers no evidence or\nargument to distinguish this different treatment of Wheat before and after\nexercising her protected rights. 4 Therefore, the Commission’s inconsistent\ntreatment of Wheat raises disputed issues of material fact as to whether: but\nfor exercising her rights she would have been discharged.\n       There is more, however. There is evidence that the Commission has been\ninconsistent in its discharge of other employees who mistreated juveniles.\nEdwin Marshall, a “Night Supervisor,” stated in his declaration that he was\ndischarged after “chemically restrain[ing]” a juvenile who “refuse[d] to obey\norders and continued to threaten staff with bodily harm.”                         Marshall\nDeclaration, at 2. But, when a different “supervisor restrained a . . . juvenile\nand gave the juvenile several knee strikes while the juvenile was in handcuffs,”\nthe Commission did not discharge him. Id. at 2–3.\n       Thus, in sum, the record before us indicates that the Commission has\ndischarged some employees for excessive force, but not others. This mixed\nrecord constitutes substantial evidence of a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether Wheat’s discharge would have occurred “but for” exercising her\n\n\n       3On appeal, for the first time, the Commission “agree[d] that to the extent Ms.\nWheat’s prior use of excessive force shows that her conduct was not unprecedented, the\nCommission stood corrected.” Appellee Brief, at 34.\n       4 Although the Commission has consistently described the 2005 incident in its briefing\nbefore the district court, and this Court, it has never attempted to address or explain why it\ntreated Wheat differently in 2005, than it did in 2012.\n                                             14\n\f    Case: 14-30788        Document: 00513329552          Page: 15     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nprotected rights. Thus, the district court erred in granting summary judgment\nfor the Commission.\n                                              IV.\n       For these reasons, the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\nCommission with regard to Wheat’s retaliatory termination claim is\nVACATED and the case is REMANDED for further consideration not\ninconsistent with this opinion.           The judgment is AFFIRMED in all other\nrespects. 5\n                                                           VACATED and REMANDED\n                                                            in part; AFFIRMED in part.\n\n\n\n\n       5Wheat also alleged a sexual harassment claim under Title VII because a twelve-year-\nold, female resident under her supervision made sexual advances toward her. After\nreviewing the record, we find that this claim of inmate on employee harassment has no merit\nunder Title VII against the employer. See Royal v. CCC & R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., 736 F.3d\n396, 401 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Relevant [Title VII harassment] factors are ‘the frequency of the\ndiscriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a\nmere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work\nperformance.’”) (citations omitted); see also Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268,\n271 (2001) (rejecting a sexual-harassment claim in part because “[t]he ordinary terms and\nconditions of [the plaintiff’s] job required her to review the sexually explicit statement” that\nformed the basis of the harassment complaint).\n                                              15\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552       Page: 16   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\nREEVES, District Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n      I agree that Lillie Wheat’s retaliatory termination claim should proceed\nto trial, while her sexual harassment claim cannot survive summary judgment.\nDespite my agreement with much of the opinion, the majority errs when it\nfinds no prima facie case of pre-termination retaliation. To reach that\nconclusion, the majority has to: (1) disregard record evidence, and (2) ignore\nthe defendant’s concession in the district court that Wheat had made out such\na prima facie case. I therefore must respectfully dissent.\n                                           I.\n      When a person sues her former employer and succeeds, she may not be\nwelcomed back with open arms. Embarrassing facts may have been unearthed\nduring the litigation; enemies may have been made. Facing scorn upon return\nis not itself retaliation, true – but it is only natural for an employee to be alert\nto the possibility. Retaliation still happens in this day and age. See, e.g., Brown\nv. Mississippi Dep’t of Health, 256 F. App’x 710 (5th Cir. 2007) (affirming jury\nverdict finding that the Mississippi Department of Health racially\ndiscriminated against Albert Brown); Brown v. Mississippi Dep’t of Health, 550\nF. App’x 228 (5th Cir. 2013) (affirming jury verdict finding that the Mississippi\nDepartment of Health retaliated against Brown because he had prevailed in\nhis earlier racial discrimination suit).\n      Wheat was an Assistant Director at the Florida Parishes Juvenile\nDetention Center (FPJDC). After years of dutiful service, she was fired while\non FMLA leave and had to seek judicial relief to get her job back. Wheat\nreached an amicable settlement and returned to work. Upon her return,\nthough, FPJDC assigned Wheat to janitorial duties for three weeks.\n      That’s retaliation as a matter of common sense. I recognize that there is\nnot always a perfect overlap between common sense and the law, but in this\n                                           16\n\f   Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552      Page: 17   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\ncase they are one and the same. In other words, common sense tells me that\nthe reassignment was obvious retaliation, and the rules of procedure instruct\nthat the issue should be resolved by a jury.\n                                       II.\n      The majority begins with an “important” reminder: FPJDC is a\ncorrectional institution “primarily for youths who are emotionally challenged,\nexhibit drug and alcohol problems, mental problems, and suicidal tendencies.”\nSlip Op. at 4. The description comes from the affidavit of Steven Happel,\nFPJDC’s Director of Administration.\n      I personally find this description unfortunate. “Emotionally challenged”\nis not a clinical diagnosis. “Suicidal tendencies” probably should have read\n“suicidal ideation.” And claiming that these children have “mental problems”\nis hopelessly vague if not outright offensive.\n      FPJDC is a typical juvenile detention center, not a specialized treatment\nfacility. Like other juvenile detention centers, it houses a variety of children.\nSome have committed criminal offenses. Others are victims of violence seeking\nrefuge. And quite a few shouldn’t be there in the first place – especially those\nwho face no criminal charges. See N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 239 (2d\nCir. 2004) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (describing\nthe “troubled adolescent girls facing no criminal charges” who were detained\nand subjected to squat-and-cough strip searches).\n      The truth is that kids are detained in juvenile detention centers for all\nkinds of behavior. Hundreds of thousands of children run away from home\nafter suffering sexual or physical abuse. Lois A. Weithorn, Envisioning Second-\nOrder Change in America’s Responses to Troubled and Troublesome Youth, 33\nHofstra L. Rev. 1305, 1379 (2005). Yet hundreds of thousands of these “status\n\n\n                                       17\n\f     Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552             Page: 18   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-30788\noffenders” wind up in juvenile detention centers each year. 1 Patricia J. Arthur\n& Regina Waugh, Status Offenses and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention Act: The Exception That Swallowed the Rule, 7 Seattle J. for Soc.\nJust. 555, 555-56 (2009). Children have even been arrested for minor\nschoolhouse disciplinary infractions including “texting, passing gas in class,\nviolating the school dress code, stealing two dollars from a classmate, bringing\na cell phone to class, arriving late to school, or telling classmates waiting in\nthe school lunch line that he would ‘get them’ if they ate all of the potatoes.”\nJason P.

At the summary judgment stage in particular, Judges “do not\nweigh the evidence, assess its probative value, or resolve any factual disputes.”\nAubrey v. Sch. Bd. of Lafayette Par., 92 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir. 1996).\n       In this case, my duty requires me to acknowledge that the majority’s\ndescription of FPJDC is accurately drawn from competent summary judgment\nevidence: Happel’s affidavit.\n       In her summary judgment response, Wheat (through counsel) argued\ngenerally that Happel’s characterization was ambiguous and irrelevant. A\nmore specific objection may have had some merit at trial, but Wheat failed to\n\n\n\n       1 “Status offenders” include children who have run away, skipped school, or broken\ncurfew, among other things. See Arthur & Waugh, 7 Seattle J. for Soc. Just. at 555.\n       2 “The ‘School-to-Prison Pipeline’ (STPP) refers to the framework of the United States\n\nschool system that, by design, pushes students out of public schools through suspension or\nexpulsion and into a juvenile detention facility or prison.” Matthew W. Burris, Mississippi\nand the School-to-Prison Pipeline, 3 Widener J.L., Econ. & Race 1, 2 (2011).\n                                              18\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552         Page: 19     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-30788\nsubmit evidence contradicting this portion of Happel’s affidavit. 3 As a result,\nthe only evidence on this point is from Happel, and the majority is justified in\nrelying upon it in the opinion.\n                                            III.\n       I described the above only because the majority has not given the same\ndeference to Wheat’s evidence of pre-termination retaliation.\n       First, the majority errs by disregarding Wheat’s sworn declaration that\nshe “was initially assigned to perform janitorial work and do intake” upon her\nreturn to work. That too is evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) (listing\ndeclarations as competent summary judgment evidence). The majority’s\nassertions that the declaration was merely “an allegation,” a “bare-bones\nallegation,” “an unsupported conclusory claim,” and “a bare allegation” are\nincorrect as a matter of law. Slip Op. at 7. There is no justification for\ndiscounting this evidence.\n       The majority’s error is compounded when it concludes that janitorial\nduties are not materially adverse. My colleague has defined materially adverse\nas something which inherently causes harm to an employee. Halliburton Co.\nv. Admin. Review Bd., 596 F. App’x 340, 341 (5th Cir. 2015) (Jolly, J.,\ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). In other words, something is\nmaterially adverse when “the negative effect on the employee is clear.” Id.\n       Common sense suggests that a downward reassignment to janitorial\nduties has a clear negative effect on the employee. The plain meaning of janitor\nis someone who cleans up after others. See, e.g., Webster’s Third New\n\n\n\n       3 In fact, Wheat is equally if not more qualified than Happel to describe the needs of\nthe children in her care. She had worked at FPJDC longer than Happel, and had risen\nthrough the ranks as a line officer, Shift Supervisor, and then Assistant Director. But\nWheat’s counsel failed to submit evidence from Wheat (or anyone else) on this point.\n                                             19\n\f    Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552        Page: 20     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-30788\nInternational Dictionary 1209 (1993) (defining janitor as “one that keeps the\npremises of an apartment, office, or other building clean and free of refuse”).\nJanitors sweep. They dust. They mop. They pick up and take out the trash.\nThey clean up messes others make by accident or by slothfulness. The\nunfortunate contradiction inherent in their jobs, like so many jobs today, is\nthat they perform essential functions for other professionals yet receive low\npay, have little status, and are too-often invisible. 4 It would be a demotion for\nanyone not hired as a janitor to be reassigned to janitorial duties.\n      If plain meaning is not enough, decisions from the Supreme Court and\ntwo courts of appeal, including this one, support the conclusion that\nreassignment to janitorial duties is materially adverse.\n      In Burlington Northern, the Supreme Court held that a job reassignment\nis materially adverse when it involves “dirtier” work, has less “prestige,” and\nis objectively considered a worse job. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v.\nWhite, 548 U.S. 53, 71 (2006). The majority opinion quotes these criteria but\napplies them in the exact wrong way. If reassignment to janitorial tasks –\ndirtier, less prestigious, and worse than other duties – does not satisfy\nBurlington Northern, what would?\n      This very Court has found that reassignment to janitorial duties is\nmaterially adverse. In Wilson v.

That holds true even when non-executives are reassigned to janitorial\nduties. See Hoyle v. Freightliner, LLC, 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th Cir. 2011)\n(concluding at summary judgment that truck assembler’s reassignment from\nher regular position to unspecified janitorial duties was materially adverse).\n       The majority endeavors mightily to distinguish our case from Wilson. 5 It\nhas convinced me of only two salient distinctions.\n       The first – and the elephant in the room – is that this Court refused to\nallow a white-collar corporate executive to be reassigned to janitorial duties,\nbut will allow a blue-collar correctional officer to be reassigned to those duties.\nWhy that makes sense in a system predicated upon equal justice under law is\nbeyond me. 6 “In my conscientious view, the Court should . . . mete out employee\nrights on the same standard to all.” Halliburton, 596 F.

It is difficult to reconcile those statements\nwith today’s admonishment that Wheat should have explained (in her complaint no less)\n“why assignment to janitorial duties was an act of retaliation or an adverse employment\naction.” Slip Op. at 9. It was just last year that the Supreme Court rebuked this court for\ninsisting that a complaint contain such a “punctiliously stated theory of the pleadings.”\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, Miss., 135 S. Ct. 346, 347 (2014) (per curiam) (quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n                                             21\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552          Page: 22     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\ndenial of rehearing en banc) (complaining that “a particular panel can find\nlanguage, and indeed even legal principles, that likely will support any\nconclusion that it may reach” as to whether an adverse employment action has\noccurred).\n       The second distinction is that Wilson presented evidence to a jury about\nthe extent and nature of his janitorial duties, while Wheat has not yet had that\nopportunity. But the reason for this is obvious.\n       Wheat submitted evidence that she had been assigned janitorial duties,\nand argued that those duties were materially adverse. In response, FPJDC\nconceded for purposes of summary judgment “that the plaintiff has established\nher prima facie case with respect to her FMLA retaliation and Title VII gender\ndiscrimination claims.” While it moved on to argue that it had a legitimate\nreason for terminating Wheat and that Wheat had failed to show pretext – i.e.,\nthe second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas analysis – it never\ncomplained of ambiguity or introduced counter-evidence on the specifics of\nWheat’s janitorial duties. 7\n       In other words, battle was not joined in the briefing or evidence over the\nmaterially adverse element the majority finds lacking today: the nature of\nWheat’s janitorial “duties, time spent, or the humiliation, if any, that she\nsuffered.” Slip Op. at 9. The evidence that she performed those duties was\nconceded to the defendant’s satisfaction, and the plain meaning of what those\nduties entail – dirtier, less prestigious, and worse than other tasks – went\n\n\n\n       7 The defendant’s concession renders moot whether janitorial duties were regularly\nexpected from line officers at the facility. On that point, however, the defendant’s appellate\nbrief states that when Wheat was reinstated as a JDS officer, “for the first few weeks after\nher reinstatement, she was given janitorial and intake duties, before being assigned regular\nJDS duties.” Defendant’s Brief at 14 (emphasis added). I take that to mean that janitorial\nand intake duties were not regular duties of an officer in Wheat’s position.\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552          Page: 23     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nunchallenged. 8 Wheat simply had no duty to detail the adversity inherent in\nher reassignment to janitorial duties.\n       From all this I conclude that the majority’s we-don’t-know-what-\njanitorial-duties-really-means argument cannot be considered on appeal\nbecause it was not made in the district court. 9 And it would be “gratuitous for\nthe majority to aid [a party] with a . . . theory of its own devising. Instead, we\nshould consider the . . . argument that [it] actually makes.” Mabary v. Home\nTown Bank, N.A., 771 F.3d 820, 828 (5th Cir. 2014) (Jolly, J., dissenting),\nopinion withdrawn (Jan. 8, 2015); see also United States v.

Since it was\nobvious and unchallenged, Wheat did not have to attach evidence quantifying the amount of\ntrash she had to pick up or the esteem in which her colleagues held janitorial work.\n        Consider other examples from everyday life: When a maître de is assigned to do the\nduties of a waiter or bus-boy, would there have to be a long discussion about what those\nspecific duties are? Or wouldn’t the parties simply agree that the bus-boy cleans tables while\nthe waiter takes orders and caters to the diners? Is there any doubt that a concierge would\nview the tasks of a hotel maid as less prestigious? If the business manager of an Am Law 100\nfirm was assigned to be a receptionist or runner, we would have no problem understanding\nthe nature of the duties and the significance of the demotion. Or would we?\n        9 “It is well settled in this Circuit that the scope of appellate review on a summary\n\njudgment order is limited to matters presented to the district court.” Keelan v. Majesco\nSoftware, Inc., 407 F.3d 332, 339 (5th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). When arguments are\n“not even mentioned, much less argued, in the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, in\nthe plaintiffs’ response to the motion for summary judgment, or in the district court’s\nmemorandum opinion granting summary judgment,” they are “not properly presented to the\ndistrict court” and cannot be considered on appeal. Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d 252, 262 (5th\nCir. 2002).\n        The district court dismissed Wheat’s janitorial reassignment by reasoning that three\nweeks’ worth of those duties did not rise to the level of an ultimate employment decision. But\nthat finding was infected by the application of what all parties and panel members agree was\nthe wrong legal standard. The correct question is whether Wheat’s reassignment was\nmaterially adverse. It was. See Halliburton, 596 F. App’x at 340-41.\n                                             23\n\f    Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552        Page: 24     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-30788\nattempt to relitigate an issue forfeited below”), opinion withdrawn and\nsuperseded, 467 F.3d 912 (5th Cir. 2006).\n       We need not debate the relative strength of Wheat’s evidence. As my\ncolleague explained last year, in a case in which he found “feeble evidence,”\n       [w]e have recognized at the summary judgment stage that the\n       nonmoving party need not reduce all its evidence to an admissible\n       form. Although it appears to me that much of the evidence is\n       currently vague and relies heavily on speculation, I believe the\n       panel has exercised appropriate caution by remanding this case to\n       proceed with a trial.\n\n\nRoque v. Natchitoches Par. Sch. Bd., 583 F. App’x 466, 471 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(Jolly, J., concurring) (citation omitted). This sound advice should be applied\nhere. Accord Hoyle, 650 F.3d at 334 (“[W]e have never held that a weak case is\nnecessarily one that should be disposed of on summary judgment. The question\nat the summary judgment stage is not whether a jury is sure to find a verdict\nfor the plaintiff; the question is whether a reasonable jury could rationally so\nfind.”).\n       With respect, I cannot join Part III.A of the majority opinion. 10\n\n\n\n\n       10 Although less compelling, the majority’s analysis of Wheat’s delayed raise also\nmerits discussion. At least to my eyes, Wheat’s performance evaluation showed that her\n“Very Good” rating made her due for a 4% step increase. I am not sure how the majority\nconcludes otherwise. Slip Op. at 10.\n       Other record evidence supports an inference that Wheat should have received that\nevaluation and step increase months earlier. The affidavit of Assistant Shift Supervisor\nBrennan Sessions stated that “Ms. Wheat consistently earned annual pay raises, and her job\nperformance evaluations were either ‘Very Good’ or ‘Outstanding.’” (Emphasis added). Since\nshe reasonably expected annual raises tied to her annual performance reviews, it is\npremature to conclude that the delay was nonretaliatory, particularly when combined with\nthe other retaliatory act (e.g., the janitorial duties).\n                                           24\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552       Page: 25    Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\n                                        IV.\n       A final word is owed on Wheat’s sexual harassment claim. As the\nmajority correctly concludes, Wheat’s interactions with the alleged harasser\ndid not objectively create a severe or pervasive hostile work environment.\n       At the same time, I do not think the majority suggests – and I would not\nagree if it had – that inmate-on-employee sexual harassment claims will\nalways fail because correctional officers should expect severe or pervasive\nsexual advances as “ordinary terms and conditions” of their job. Slip Op. at 15\nn.5 (quotation marks and citation omitted). That proposition is unsupported by\ncase law. See Beckford v. Dep’t of Corr., 605 F.3d 951, 953 (11th Cir. 2010) (“We\nconclude that the jury was entitled to find the [Florida Department of\nCorrections] liable under Title VII because it unreasonably failed to remedy\nthe sexual harassment by its inmates.”); Vajdl v. Mesabi Acad. of KidsPeace,\nInc., 484 F.3d 546, 550 n.2 (8th Cir. 2007); Freitag v.

Holder, 739 F.3d 184, 193 (5th Cir. 2013) (Jolly, J., concurring)\n(“I can see no compelling reason to initiate a circuit split”).\n                                        25\n\fCase: 14-30788   Document: 00513329552      Page: 26   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                             No. 14-30788\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                   26\n\f",

Wheat was eventually promoted to JDS officer,\nthen to Shift Supervisor in 2005, and ultimately to Assistant Director of\nFemale Services in 2008. Additionally, she had received positive reviews and\nconsistent pay raises. In January 2005, however, Wheat was disciplined after\nshe used excessive force against a juvenile inmate. By failing to defuse a\nhostile situation with the juvenile, or alert other JDS officers, Wheat had\nallowed the juvenile to get within her reach. Wheat then physically forced the\njuvenile down to the ground and held her there, violating FPJDC’s guidelines.\n      In 2009, Wheat took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act\n(“FMLA”), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., to undergo surgery. The Commission\nterminated her employment for failing to return to work after her FMLA leave\nhad expired. She filed suit under the FMLA. The suit was settled, and her\nemployment at the Commission was reinstated on March 8, 2011. At the time,\nher previous position as Assistant Director of Female Services was not\navailable. Consequently, she was hired at a lower ranking position as a JDS\nOfficer. However, she was paid the same salary as her previous supervisory\nposition. After being rehired, supervisory positions became available and, on\ntwo separate occasions, she was offered advancement to a supervisory position.\nWheat turned down both offers because “she did not want to go back on salary\nand assume additional responsibility,” and “she would lose her right to\novertime.”\n      On November 23, 2011, Wheat filed an “Unusual Occurrence Report”\nconcerning a twelve-year-old female inmate’s alleged inappropriate sexual\nadvances toward Wheat.        Wheat’s supervisors met with her on several\noccasions to discuss the proper methods for handling such advances. Wheat\nwas dissatisfied with the disciplinary limitations which these models imposed.\nShe requested that the juvenile be placed in administrative segregation. Her\nrequests were denied.\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552    Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-30788\n      On January 3, 2012, Wheat had another physical episode with a female\ninmate. Responding to the juvenile’s noncompliant behavior, Wheat applied a\n“mandibular angle pressure point” hold to the juvenile. Wheat was ordered to\ncease, and her supervisor had to restrain her. Wheat then had to be restrained\na second time. Wheat followed the same juvenile to her cell, and although\nprovoked by the juvenile, further attempted to assault her. Wheat threatened\nto “whip that bitch’s ass.” Wheat was placed on leave, without pay, for these\ntwo eruptions and was shortly thereafter discharged, on January 19, 2012.\n      After exhausting her remedies with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5, Wheat filed this suit. In her\ncomplaint, she alleged that she was discharged in retaliation for having\nasserted her rights under the FMLA, and under Title VII (for having\ncomplained about the juvenile’s sexual advances).        She also alleged ten\nadditional retaliatory acts by the Commission, as well as sexual harassment\nby the juvenile resident. The district court granted summary judgment to the\nCommission, dismissing Wheat’s complaint.         Wheat v.

Retaliation claims under both Title VII and the FMLA, however, are\nanalyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Chaffin\nv. John H.

We turn, then, to determine\nwhether these retaliation claims survive summary judgment under current\nlaw.\n        We have examined these various retaliation claims and find that most\nare unsupported by the record and are devoid of merit.

The Court observed that “[w]hether a\nparticular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances\nof the particular case.” Id. at 71. Those circumstances are missing here.\nIndeed, Burlington illustrated that merely changing an employee’s job title will\nnot suffice to constitute a materially adverse action without further detail. Id.\nat 70–71. The Court reasoned that the record evidence indicated that the\nplaintiff was reassigned to perform “only standard track laborer tasks,” “that\nthe track laborer duties were by all accounts more arduous and dirtier,” and\n“that the forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an\nindication of prestige.” Id. at 58, 71 (emphasis added) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).      “Based on this record,” the Court said, “a jury could\nreasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been\nmaterially adverse to a reasonable employee.” Id. at 71 (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, there is no record evidence that\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552       Page: 8   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-30788\nprovides any description, whatsoever, of Wheat’s alleged temporary\nassignment of janitorial duties.\n      Furthermore, Wheat can find no succor in Wilson v.

There, the employer had reassigned the\nplaintiff—a former “executive manager”—to a position as “an entry level\nwarehouse supervisor with menial and demeaning duties.” Id. at 1145. We\nupheld the jury’s finding that this conduct was “extreme and outrageous,”\npointing to record evidence regarding the plaintiff’s qualifications (he “had\nbeen a long-time executive” with the employer and was “responsible for the\nlargest project in the company’s history,” which he completed “on time and\nunder budget”); the specific nature of the plaintiff’s duties as warehouse\nsupervisor (he “was frequently required to sweep the warehouse” and “was\nreduced to cleaning up after the employees in the warehouse cafeteria after\ntheir lunch hour”); and the extent to which his work time was occupied with\nthe menial tasks (“Wilson spent 75 percent of his time performing these\nmenial, janitorial duties.”). Id. at 1145–46. Wilson also had to perform all of\nhis janitorial duties under a sign that read “Wilson is old.” Id. There is no\nrecord here that provides any suggestion of Wheat’s duties, time spent, or the\nhumiliation, if any, that she suffered.\n      Furthermore, nowhere in her complaint does Wheat allege why\nassignment to janitorial duties was an act of retaliation or an adverse\nemployment action. Before the district court, she alleged “Wheat was initially\nassigned to perform janitorial work and do intake. A few weeks later, Wheat\nwas assigned to Echo Mod which houses male juveniles. In late April, early\nMay, 2011, Wheat was notified by Donald Carter, Shift Supervisor, that she\nwas being re-assigned to the girls’ mod.” Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontested\nFact, Doc. 40-1, ¶16.     This statement is the complete reference to her\nassignment of janitorial duties that can be found in the record before the\n                                          8\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552      Page: 9     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\ndistrict court.   Nothing more.   There is no indication that she raised the\nslightest objection to this assignment. There is no indication of how much time\nwas spent doing these “janitorial duties” as opposed to doing “intake” work.\nThe district court was never told whether she was asked to perform unpleasant\n“janitorial tasks” (e.g., cleaning bathrooms), “janitorial tasks” that were minor\nin nature (e.g., changing lightbulbs, dusting a few desks, or simply cleaning up\nher own desk), or, indeed, whether her tasks could reasonably be classified as\njanitorial at all. Nor was the district court told what portion of Wheat’s work\nday was devoted to “janitorial duties.”     Was it all of her workday (as in\nBurlington, 548 U.S. at 58), 75 percent of her workday (as in Wilson, 939 F.2d\nat 1145), less than 5 minutes per week, or any part of her workday at all?\nNeither the district court nor we have the slightest idea.\n      Moreover, the dissent says that on appeal “the Commission admits that\njanitorial duties were not ‘regular’ duties of line officers.”        This alleged\nstatement was never made before the district court; nor was it ever made by\nWheat at any time. To be sure, the dissent mischaracterizes the Commission’s\nbrief in this respect. The Commission actually said:\n      Moreover, Ms. Wheat has not offered any evidence that her being\n      assigned such chores constituted different treatment from other\n      JDS officers. Ms. Wheat offers no evidence that this short\n      assignment of janitorial and intake duties was anything more than\n      her supervisors finding work for her until regular JDS officer\n      duties became available. This is a legitimate, non-retaliatory\n      motivation. Applying the correct standard to these facts, it\n      becomes apparent that this temporary assignment falls far short\n      of being materially adverse to a reasonable employee in Ms.\n      Wheat’s position.\nAppellee’s Brief, p. 14–15. Properly read, the record does not exclude the\npossibility that some “janitorial duties” were expected of JDS officers\ngenerally—but especially those, like Wheat, who had just recently been hired\nor reinstated.\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 14-30788   Document: 00513329552      Page: 10   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\n      In sum, Wheat’s mere assignment of janitorial duties, without further\ndescription or detail about what those duties actually were, does not state a\nmaterially adverse action under Burlington or Wilson. In short, she has failed\nto meet her burden of making a prima facie case of retaliation.\n                                       2.\n      Next, Wheat alleges that her performance evaluation was untimely and\nthat “[a]ccording to the evaluation, [she] should have received a 4% pay\nincrease.” Although Wheat’s performance evaluation form rated her Overall\nJob Performance Rating as “Very Good”, the form clearly stated that she was\nnot authorized for a step increase. More importantly, at the conclusion of her\nperformance review, Wheat signed the findings of the review committee as\nfollows:\n      I have read this evaluation and reviewed a copy of it. I understand\n      that my signature does not constitute or imply my agreement,\n      unless marked so. Should I disagree with this rating, I understand\n      that I my [sic] appeal to the appropriate manager.\nROA.403 (emphasis added).\n      Wheat also checked the box that read “I have reviewed and agree with\nthis rating.” Id. She did not object to or appeal this evaluation. Further, the\nrecord is silent as to why she did not elect to appeal. In short, Wheat produced\nno evidence to show that the delay in her evaluation or the failure to grant her\n4% step increase—accompanied by a right of appeal that she did not exercise—\nconstituted a materially adverse action.\n      The dissent concludes that it “may be materially adverse when an\nemployee is effectively denied (or delayed by several months) a 4% raise\nindicated by her performance evaluation.” (Emphasis added).           Thus, the\ndissent, by the use of the word “may”, seems to acknowledge that Wheat has\nfailed to meet her burden of establishing her claim. Furthermore, the dissent\nasserts that a disputed issue of material fact exists based on the possibility\n                                      10\n\f    Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552         Page: 11   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-30788\nthat the Commission’s action “may be materially adverse when an employee is\neffectively denied . . . a 4% raise indicated by her performance evaluation.”\n(Emphasis added). Even so, as previously indicated, the dissent’s premise is\nwrong on the record facts. This possibility is not enough to create a material\nfact or issue of law that bars summary judgment, especially when the\nunderlying premise of such “possibility” appears to be false.\n      Therefore, Wheat has failed to meet her burden of making a prima facie\ncase of retaliation for this claim.\n                                           3.\n      Next, Wheat alleges that the denial of a transfer request was a\nretaliatory, materially adverse action.         Specifically, Wheat requested the\ntransfer because she objected to working around one particularly disruptive\njuvenile. As with the janitorial duties, Wheat has presented no evidence that\nthe denial of the reassignment made her job “objectively” worse.                  See\nBurlington, 548 U.S. at 71. It did not “affect[] her job title, grade, hours, salary,\nor benefits,” nor is there any indication that working with females resulted in\na “diminution in prestige or change in standing among her co-workers.” See\nStewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"68597\"><a href=\"/opinion/68597/stewart-v-mississippi-transp-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (5th Cir. 2009).\nAdditionally, mere denial of a reassignment to a purely lateral position (“no\nreduction in pay and no more than a minor change in working conditions”), is\ntypically not a materially adverse action.

Furthermore, as the Commission points\nout, Wheat had worked, apparently without complaint, in the female section\nfor eight years.\n      Therefore, under these circumstances, the denial of a reassignment was\nnot, as a matter of law, an adverse action. Accordingly, Wheat has not met her\nburden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation for this claim.\n\n\n                                          11\n\f   Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552         Page: 12   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\n                                 *     *       *\n      Although the district court erroneously evaluated the Commission’s\nallegedly retaliatory actions using the now-abrogated “ultimate employment\ndecisions” standard, Wheat’s pre-termination retaliation claims fail even\nunder current law. Thus, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the Commission with respect to these retaliation claims.\n                                       B.\n      Finally, we turn to Wheat’s retaliatory termination claim. It is clear that\nWheat’s discharge constitutes a “materially adverse action.” See, e.g., Royal v.\nCCC&R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 400 (5th Cir. 2013) (“It is clear that\nan adverse employment action occurred here—Royal was fired.”). We thus\nturn to Wheat’s burden to show a “causal link” between her discharge and\nexercising her protected rights. Again, it unclear whether the “causal link”\nrequirement for FMLA retaliation claims involves the same “but for” analysis\nrequired for Title VII retaliation claims. See Nassar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"931121\"><a href=\"/opinion/931121/university-of-tex-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is\nclear, however, that the plaintiff “may avoid summary judgment on ‘but for’\ncausation by demonstrating ‘a conflict in substantial evidence on this ultimate\nissue.’” Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"622564\"><a href=\"/opinion/622564/hernandez-v-yellow-transp-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(“Evidence is ‘substantial’ if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable\nand fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach\ndifferent conclusions.”) (citation omitted).   As we shall see, however, here\nwhich standard we apply does not affect the outcome because Wheat’s claim\nsurvives the heightened showing of “but for” causation.           Then, when the\nplaintiff sets out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, “the burden\nshifts to the employer to state a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for” the\nadverse action. Davis, 765 F.3d at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      Initially, however, Wheat, as the plaintiff, bears the burden to provide\nsubstantial evidence for this claim.    Wheat must illustrate that “but for”\n                                       12\n\f   Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552    Page: 13   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-30788\nexercising her Title VII and FMLA protected rights, she would not have been\ndischarged. Wheat effectively acknowledges the conduct with which she was\ncharged, but contends that the actual cause of her termination was that she\nasserted her protected rights. She points to other specific instances in which\nshe, and other employees as well, were physically excessive toward juveniles\nbut not discharged.\n      In this connection, the record shows that Wheat herself was previously\nimproperly excessive in dealing with a juvenile in 2005. At that time she had\nnever asserted Title VII or FMLA rights. Responding to this 2005 incident,\nthe FPJDC’s Operations Manager “recommended three days suspension\nwithout pay and six months [of] probation.” Affidavit of Steven Happel, at 4,\n¶34. The Executive Director, however, “[r]ecognizing Ms. Wheat’s ‘exemplary\njob performance’ . . . reduced the disciplinary action to a written reprimand”\nand required Wheat to “undergo additional training.” Id. at ¶35. But with\nrespect to the 2012 incident, after asserting her Title VII and FMLA rights,\nthe Commission terminated Wheat’s employment because, it said, “No JDS\nofficer had ever physically attacked a youth resident before Ms. Wheat did,\nand, no JDS officer was allowed to remain in the Commission's employ after\nany such attack.” Defendant’s Amended Statement of Uncontested Fact, Doc.\n39, ¶72. Wheat rebutted this assertion by offering evidence of other employees\nwho were violent towards juvenile residents, but were not discharged by the\nCommission. See Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontested Fact, Doc. 40-1, ¶72. It\nwas only after Wheat brought these allegations of the Commission’s disparate\ntreatment of its employees to the attention of the district court, that the\nCommission modified its reasons for termination. In its revised explanation\nfor her discharge, the Commission asserted that Wheat’s second “violent attack\non a youth resident . . . gave the Commission compelling grounds to fire her to\nprotect the health and safety of the youth residents.” Defendant’s Second\n                                      13\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552          Page: 14     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nReply Memo, Doc. 46, at 9.            After providing its revised explanation, the\nCommission did not make any reference, corrective or otherwise, to its original\nnon-retaliatory explanation for discharging Wheat (“[n]o JDS officer [] ever\nphysically attacked a youth . . . [or was] allowed to remain in the Commission's\nemploy after any such attack”). 3 In other words, the grounds for Wheat’s\ndischarge related solely to the incidents of January 3, 2012, immediately\npreceding her discharge. In this light, the Commission offers no evidence or\nargument to distinguish this different treatment of Wheat before and after\nexercising her protected rights. 4 Therefore, the Commission’s inconsistent\ntreatment of Wheat raises disputed issues of material fact as to whether: but\nfor exercising her rights she would have been discharged.\n       There is more, however. There is evidence that the Commission has been\ninconsistent in its discharge of other employees who mistreated juveniles.\nEdwin Marshall, a “Night Supervisor,” stated in his declaration that he was\ndischarged after “chemically restrain[ing]” a juvenile who “refuse[d] to obey\norders and continued to threaten staff with bodily harm.”                         Marshall\nDeclaration, at 2. But, when a different “supervisor restrained a . . . juvenile\nand gave the juvenile several knee strikes while the juvenile was in handcuffs,”\nthe Commission did not discharge him. Id. at 2–3.\n       Thus, in sum, the record before us indicates that the Commission has\ndischarged some employees for excessive force, but not others. This mixed\nrecord constitutes substantial evidence of a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether Wheat’s discharge would have occurred “but for” exercising her\n\n\n       3On appeal, for the first time, the Commission “agree[d] that to the extent Ms.\nWheat’s prior use of excessive force shows that her conduct was not unprecedented, the\nCommission stood corrected.” Appellee Brief, at 34.\n       4 Although the Commission has consistently described the 2005 incident in its briefing\nbefore the district court, and this Court, it has never attempted to address or explain why it\ntreated Wheat differently in 2005, than it did in 2012.\n                                             14\n\f    Case: 14-30788        Document: 00513329552          Page: 15     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nprotected rights. Thus, the district court erred in granting summary judgment\nfor the Commission.\n                                              IV.\n       For these reasons, the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\nCommission with regard to Wheat’s retaliatory termination claim is\nVACATED and the case is REMANDED for further consideration not\ninconsistent with this opinion.           The judgment is AFFIRMED in all other\nrespects. 5\n                                                           VACATED and REMANDED\n                                                            in part; AFFIRMED in part.\n\n\n\n\n       5Wheat also alleged a sexual harassment claim under Title VII because a twelve-year-\nold, female resident under her supervision made sexual advances toward her. After\nreviewing the record, we find that this claim of inmate on employee harassment has no merit\nunder Title VII against the employer. See Royal v.

To reach that\nconclusion, the majority has to: (1) disregard record evidence, and (2) ignore\nthe defendant’s concession in the district court that Wheat had made out such\na prima facie case. I therefore must respectfully dissent.\n                                           I.\n      When a person sues her former employer and succeeds, she may not be\nwelcomed back with open arms. Embarrassing facts may have been unearthed\nduring the litigation; enemies may have been made. Facing scorn upon return\nis not itself retaliation, true – but it is only natural for an employee to be alert\nto the possibility. Retaliation still happens in this day and age. See, e.g., Brown\nv. Mississippi Dep’t of Health, 256 F. App’x 710 (5th Cir. 2007) (affirming jury\nverdict finding that the Mississippi Department of Health racially\ndiscriminated against Albert Brown); Brown v. Mississippi Dep’t of Health, 550\nF. App’x 228 (5th Cir. 2013) (affirming jury verdict finding that the Mississippi\nDepartment of Health retaliated against Brown because he had prevailed in\nhis earlier racial discrimination suit).\n      Wheat was an Assistant Director at the Florida Parishes Juvenile\nDetention Center (FPJDC). After years of dutiful service, she was fired while\non FMLA leave and had to seek judicial relief to get her job back. Wheat\nreached an amicable settlement and returned to work. Upon her return,\nthough, FPJDC assigned Wheat to janitorial duties for three weeks.\n      That’s retaliation as a matter of common sense. I recognize that there is\nnot always a perfect overlap between common sense and the law, but in this\n                                           16\n\f   Case: 14-30788     Document: 00513329552      Page: 17   Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-30788\ncase they are one and the same. In other words, common sense tells me that\nthe reassignment was obvious retaliation, and the rules of procedure instruct\nthat the issue should be resolved by a jury.\n                                       II.\n      The majority begins with an “important” reminder: FPJDC is a\ncorrectional institution “primarily for youths who are emotionally challenged,\nexhibit drug and alcohol problems, mental problems, and suicidal tendencies.”\nSlip Op. at 4. The description comes from the affidavit of Steven Happel,\nFPJDC’s Director of Administration.\n      I personally find this description unfortunate. “Emotionally challenged”\nis not a clinical diagnosis. “Suicidal tendencies” probably should have read\n“suicidal ideation.” And claiming that these children have “mental problems”\nis hopelessly vague if not outright offensive.\n      FPJDC is a typical juvenile detention center, not a specialized treatment\nfacility. Like other juvenile detention centers, it houses a variety of children.\nSome have committed criminal offenses. Others are victims of violence seeking\nrefuge. And quite a few shouldn’t be there in the first place – especially those\nwho face no criminal charges. See N.G. v.

That too is evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) (listing\ndeclarations as competent summary judgment evidence). The majority’s\nassertions that the declaration was merely “an allegation,” a “bare-bones\nallegation,” “an unsupported conclusory claim,” and “a bare allegation” are\nincorrect as a matter of law. Slip Op. at 7. There is no justification for\ndiscounting this evidence.\n       The majority’s error is compounded when it concludes that janitorial\nduties are not materially adverse. My colleague has defined materially adverse\nas something which inherently causes harm to an employee. Halliburton Co.\nv. Admin. Review Bd., 596 F. App’x 340, 341 (5th Cir. 2015) (Jolly, J.,\ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). In other words, something is\nmaterially adverse when “the negative effect on the employee is clear.” Id.\n       Common sense suggests that a downward reassignment to janitorial\nduties has a clear negative effect on the employee. The plain meaning of janitor\nis someone who cleans up after others. See, e.g., Webster’s Third New\n\n\n\n       3 In fact, Wheat is equally if not more qualified than Happel to describe the needs of\nthe children in her care. She had worked at FPJDC longer than Happel, and had risen\nthrough the ranks as a line officer, Shift Supervisor, and then Assistant Director. But\nWheat’s counsel failed to submit evidence from Wheat (or anyone else) on this point.\n                                             19\n\f    Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552        Page: 20     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-30788\nInternational Dictionary 1209 (1993) (defining janitor as “one that keeps the\npremises of an apartment, office, or other building clean and free of refuse”).\nJanitors sweep. They dust. They mop. They pick up and take out the trash.\nThey clean up messes others make by accident or by slothfulness. The\nunfortunate contradiction inherent in their jobs, like so many jobs today, is\nthat they perform essential functions for other professionals yet receive low\npay, have little status, and are too-often invisible. 4 It would be a demotion for\nanyone not hired as a janitor to be reassigned to janitorial duties.\n      If plain meaning is not enough, decisions from the Supreme Court and\ntwo courts of appeal, including this one, support the conclusion that\nreassignment to janitorial duties is materially adverse.\n      In Burlington Northern, the Supreme Court held that a job reassignment\nis materially adverse when it involves “dirtier” work, has less “prestige,” and\nis objectively considered a worse job. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v.\nWhite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (2006). The majority opinion quotes these criteria but\napplies them in the exact wrong way. If reassignment to janitorial tasks –\ndirtier, less prestigious, and worse than other duties – does not satisfy\nBurlington Northern, what would?\n      This very Court has found that reassignment to janitorial duties is\nmaterially adverse.

But the reason for this is obvious.\n       Wheat submitted evidence that she had been assigned janitorial duties,\nand argued that those duties were materially adverse. In response, FPJDC\nconceded for purposes of summary judgment “that the plaintiff has established\nher prima facie case with respect to her FMLA retaliation and Title VII gender\ndiscrimination claims.” While it moved on to argue that it had a legitimate\nreason for terminating Wheat and that Wheat had failed to show pretext – i.e.,\nthe second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas analysis – it never\ncomplained of ambiguity or introduced counter-evidence on the specifics of\nWheat’s janitorial duties. 7\n       In other words, battle was not joined in the briefing or evidence over the\nmaterially adverse element the majority finds lacking today: the nature of\nWheat’s janitorial “duties, time spent, or the humiliation, if any, that she\nsuffered.” Slip Op. at 9. The evidence that she performed those duties was\nconceded to the defendant’s satisfaction, and the plain meaning of what those\nduties entail – dirtier, less prestigious, and worse than other tasks – went\n\n\n\n       7 The defendant’s concession renders moot whether janitorial duties were regularly\nexpected from line officers at the facility. On that point, however, the defendant’s appellate\nbrief states that when Wheat was reinstated as a JDS officer, “for the first few weeks after\nher reinstatement, she was given janitorial and intake duties, before being assigned regular\nJDS duties.” Defendant’s Brief at 14 (emphasis added). I take that to mean that janitorial\nand intake duties were not regular duties of an officer in Wheat’s position.\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 14-30788       Document: 00513329552          Page: 23     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-30788\nunchallenged. 8 Wheat simply had no duty to detail the adversity inherent in\nher reassignment to janitorial duties.\n       From all this I conclude that the majority’s we-don’t-know-what-\njanitorial-duties-really-means argument cannot be considered on appeal\nbecause it was not made in the district court. 9 And it would be “gratuitous for\nthe majority to aid [a party] with a . . . theory of its own devising.

Since it was\nobvious and unchallenged, Wheat did not have to attach evidence quantifying the amount of\ntrash she had to pick up or the esteem in which her colleagues held janitorial work.\n        Consider other examples from everyday life: When a maître de is assigned to do the\nduties of a waiter or bus-boy, would there have to be a long discussion about what those\nspecific duties are? Or wouldn’t the parties simply agree that the bus-boy cleans tables while\nthe waiter takes orders and caters to the diners? Is there any doubt that a concierge would\nview the tasks of a hotel maid as less prestigious? If the business manager of an Am Law 100\nfirm was assigned to be a receptionist or runner, we would have no problem understanding\nthe nature of the duties and the significance of the demotion.

When arguments are\n“not even mentioned, much less argued, in the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, in\nthe plaintiffs’ response to the motion for summary judgment, or in the district court’s\nmemorandum opinion granting summary judgment,” they are “not properly presented to the\ndistrict court” and cannot be considered on appeal. Keenan v.

But\nthat finding was infected by the application of what all parties and panel members agree was\nthe wrong legal standard. The correct question is whether Wheat’s reassignment was\nmaterially adverse. It was. See Halliburton, 596 F. App’x at 340-41.\n                                             23\n\f    Case: 14-30788      Document: 00513329552        Page: 24     Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-30788\nattempt to relitigate an issue forfeited below”), opinion withdrawn and\nsuperseded, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2006).\n       We need not debate the relative strength of Wheat’s evidence. As my\ncolleague explained last year, in a case in which he found “feeble evidence,”\n       [w]e have recognized at the summary judgment stage that the\n       nonmoving party need not reduce all its evidence to an admissible\n       form. Although it appears to me that much of the evidence is\n       currently vague and relies heavily on speculation, I believe the\n       panel has exercised appropriate caution by remanding this case to\n       proceed with a trial.\n\n\nRoque v. Natchitoches Par. Sch. Bd., 583 F. App’x 466, 471 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(Jolly, J., concurring) (citation omitted). This sound advice should be applied\nhere. Accord Hoyle, 650 F.3d at 334 (“[W]e have never held that a weak case is\nnecessarily one that should be disposed of on summary judgment. The question\nat the summary judgment stage is not whether a jury is sure to find a verdict\nfor the plaintiff; the question is whether a reasonable jury could rationally so\nfind.”).\n       With respect, I cannot join Part III.A of the majority opinion. 10\n\n\n\n\n       10 Although less compelling, the majority’s analysis of Wheat’s delayed raise also\nmerits discussion. At least to my eyes, Wheat’s performance evaluation showed that her\n“Very Good” rating made her due for a 4% step increase. I am not sure how the majority\nconcludes otherwise. Slip Op. at 10.\n       Other record evidence supports an inference that Wheat should have received that\nevaluation and step increase months earlier. The affidavit of Assistant Shift Supervisor\nBrennan Sessions stated that “Ms. Wheat consistently earned annual pay raises, and her job\nperformance evaluations were either ‘Very Good’ or ‘Outstanding.’” (Emphasis added). Since\nshe reasonably expected annual raises tied to her annual performance reviews, it is\npremature to conclude that the delay was nonretaliatory, particularly when combined with\nthe other retaliatory act (e.g., the janitorial duties).\n                                           24\n\f    Case: 14-30788    Document: 00513329552       Page: 25    Date Filed: 01/05/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-30788\n                                        IV.\n       A final word is owed on Wheat’s sexual harassment claim. As the\nmajority correctly concludes, Wheat’s interactions with the alleged harasser\ndid not objectively create a severe or pervasive hostile work environment.\n       At the same time, I do not think the majority suggests – and I would not\nagree if it had – that inmate-on-employee sexual harassment claims will\nalways fail because correctional officers should expect severe or pervasive\nsexual advances as “ordinary terms and conditions” of their job. Slip Op. at 15\nn.5 (quotation marks and citation omitted). That proposition is unsupported by\ncase law. See Beckford v.
