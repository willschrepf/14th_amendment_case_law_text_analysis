April 17, 1967, the district court entered a decree patterned after this Court's mandate in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, aff'd with modifications on rehearing en banc, 380 F.2d 385, cert. denied sub nom, Caddo Parish School Board v. United States, 1967, 389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 67, 19 L.Ed.2d 103.  Following the decision of the Supreme Court in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, both the United States and the private plaintiffs filed Motions for Further Relief in light of Green.  July 25, 1969, the district court ordered the Fairfield Board of Education to prepare plans to disestablish the dual school system that was presently being maintained in the City of Fairfield.  The Board submitted a plan on August 26, 1969.  A hearing on the proposed plan was held on September 2, 1969.  The plan proposed an indefinite retention of freedom-of-choice in junior and senior high schools and the zoning of the four elementary schools.  September 4, 1969, the district court approved the plan.  This matter is now before this Court on an appeal that questions the district court's approval of the Board's plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, neither the district court's order approving the Board's plan nor the plan itself nor any plan heretofore filed or approved may stand in the face of supervening changes in the law.
