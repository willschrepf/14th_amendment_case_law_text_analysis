Calvert v. Fort Worth National Bank. 356 S.W.2d 918 ITax.\n1962): Texas State Board of Pharmacy v. Kittman. 550 S.W.2d 104 (Tex.\nCiv:App. - Tyler 1977, no writ). When articles 1659a and 2368a and\nthe other statutes cited above are considered together, it becomes\napparent that: (1) competitive bids must be taken on the election\nsupplies you inquire about as per the terms of these statutes; and (2)\nthe commissioners court is responsible for taking these bids and\ndetermining which one is most satisfactory.\n\n     It is true that article 7.07 directs the county election board to\n\"provide the supplies necessary to hold and conduct the election\"' but\nwe find nothing in this provision or in the remainder of the statute\nwhich warrants the conclusion that the other statutes cited above,\nwhich place the responsibility for taking bids on election supplies in\nthe hands of the commissioners court, have been impliedly repealed.\nOn the contrary, we believe article 7.07 is readily reconciled with\nthose statutes. The county election board is to \"provide\" needed\nelection supplies, but in so doing, it is to deal with the suppliers\nselected by the commissioners court through the bidding process. -See\nAttorney General Opinions M-302, M-233 (1968).\n\n     Your second inquiry concerns:\n\n          Items purchased from the 'profits'         of   the\n          commissary operation in the county jail.\n\n     It is our understanding that neither the county nor the sheriff\nactually operates the jail commissary in Dallas county. A private\nvendor does so pursuant to a negotiated arrangement whereby the vendor\npays a fixed sum (based upon prisoner population) and a percentage of\nthe receipts for the concession. The purchase of items for sale, the\nprices to be charged for them, and other similar management decisions\nare left to the concessionaire. The amounts realized from the vendor\nare not \"profits,\" strictly speaking, but \"income\" in the nature of\nrental income. &    Dodson v. Marshall, 118 S.W.2d 621 (Tex. Civ. App.\n- Waco 1938, writ dism'd).\n\n     However it might be characterized. we think money realized by the\ncounty or sheriff from the establishment of a jail commissary is\npublic money subject to public accountability and statutory safeguards\nrespecting its expenditure. cf. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1040 (sheriff\naccountable for \"net profits\" realized from support and maintenance of\nprisoners).\n\n     In the course of concluding that a jail commissary could be\noperated on a 'profit-making' basis by a county sheriff, Attorney\nGeneral Opinion MW-143 (1980) used the term \"profits\" to signify the\n\n\n\n\n                            p. 1510\n\fHonorable Henry Wade - Page 4   (IN-439)\n\n\n\n\nnet proceeds of sales made to prisoners from a sheriff-operated\ncommissary. The opinion indicated that immediate commissary income\nmight properly exceed immediate costs, so long as the \"profits\" were\nreinvested in the commissary operation so as to be devoted to the\nbenefit. education and welfare of la11 inmates (bv exoandinn the\namenities available to them). See Attorney General Opinions k-639\n(1975); C-67 (1963). Cf. Cityof       Bryan v. A. h M. Consolidated\nIndependent School District, 179 S.W.2d 987 (Tex. Civ. App. - Waco\n1944), aff'd, 184 S.W.2d 914 (Tex. 1945). The opinion did not suggest\nthat uurchases made with such \"nrofits\" were bevond the reach of\ncompetitive bidding statutes.\n\n     Without passing on the propriety of the vendor-operated jail\ncommissary now extant in Dallas County, we are of the opinion that\npurchases made with money realized from the establishment of a jail\ncommissary are subject to the provisions of.article 1659a. V.T.C.S.\nSee also V.T.C.S. art. 2368a.\n\n     As noted above. article 1659a requires that \"supplies of every\nkind... for the use of said county or any of its officers, departments\nor institutions, must be purchased on competitive bids.\" The contract\nis to be awarded to \"the party who, in the judgment of the\ncommissioners court, has submitted the lowest and best bid.\"\n(Emphasis added).\n\n     You suggest that article 1659a is inapplicable because article\n5116, V.T.C.S., makes the sheriff -- not the commissioners court --\nstatutorily responsible for the operation of the jail. A similar\nargument was made to the Texas Supreme Court in Anderson v. Wood, 152\nS.W.2d 152 (Tex. 1941). There it was claimed on behalf of the sheriff\nthat the commissioners court had no power to control contracts\nrespecting the operation of the courthouse because article 6872,\nV.T.C.S., provided that \"[sjheriffs shall have charge and control of\nthe courthouses...\" subject to regulations prescribed by the\ncommissioners court. Citinn two cases which concerned the nurcbase of\ndisinfectant for jails, Ge&o Manufacturing Company v. Cole&    County,\n184 S.W. 1063 (Tex. Civ. App. - Austin 1916, no writ) and American\nDisinfectant Company v. Freestone County, 193 S.W. 440 (Tex. Civ. App.\n- Dallas 1917, no writ), the court held the statute gave the sheriff\n\"0 authority to contract for the county independent of-the contracting\nauthority of the commissioners court. Cf. Attorney General Opinion\nH-1190 (1978). We do not believe articlel16,     V.T.C.S., divests the\ncommissioners court of authority in the matter.\n\n     Early court cases and opinions of the attorney general dealing\nwith the purchase and supply of food for prisoners are inapposite for\ntwo reasons. g.       article 5115, V.T.C.S.. was later amended, in\n1957, to make the commissioners court responsible for assuring \"that\nfood is prepared and served in a palatable and sanitary manner and\n\n\n\n\n                                p. 1511\n\fHonorable Henry Wade - Page 5   (MW-439)\n\n\n\n\naccording to good dietary practices and of a quality to maintain good\nhealth,\" and article 5115.1, V.T.C.S., creating the commission on jail\nstandards and (under section 11) making the commissioners court as\nwell as the sheriff responsible for compliance with the rules and\nregulations of the commission, was enacted in 1975. The establishment\nof a jail commissary is the subject of such a rule. See Attorney\nGeneral Opinion MW-143 (1980). Second, although statutoryauthority\nhas long existed for sheriffs to provide food for prisoners from an\nallowance made by the commissioners court, there is no statute now\nthat allows the sheriff to spend at his discretion any \"profits\"\nrealized from the jail operation. See V.T.C.S. art. 1040; Attorney\nGeneral, Opinion M-1220 (1972). Cf.ichita       County v. Vance, 217\nS.W.2d 702 (Tex. Civ. App. - Fort Worth 1949, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (jail\nkitchen); McKinney v. Collingsworth County, 159 8.W.2d 234 (Tex. Civ.\nAPP. - Amarillo 1942. no writ) (allowances and \"profits\"); Attorney\nGeneral Opinions C-567 (1965) (furnishing meals); V-1232 (1951)\n(contracts for meals); O-1228 (1939) (feeding prisoners); O-329 (1939)\n(purchase of food).\n\n     In our opinion, purchases made from proceeds realized by the\ncounty from the jail commissary operation in Dallas County are subject\nto the competitive bidding statutes. -See V.T.C.S. art..1659a. -Cf.\nV.T.C.S. art. 2368a.\n\n    You also ask about:\n\n         Supplies and/or equipment purchased by        the\n         criminal district attorney from the 'hot check\n         fund' established by article 53.08 of the Code of\n         Criminal Procedure.\n\n     Article 53.08 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes a\ncounty attorney, district attorney, or criminal district attorney to\ncollect a fee if his office processes a hot check under certain\ncircumstances. It further provides that:\n\n         (e) Fees collected under this article shall be\n         deposited in the county treasury in a special fund\n         to be administered by the county attorney,\n         district attorney, or criminal district attorney.\n         Expenditures from this fund shall be at the sole\n         discretion of the attorney, and may be used only\n         to defray the salaries and expenses of         the\n         prosecutor's office.... (Emphasis added).\n\n     This statute creates a special fund which is in the county\ntreasury, but which is segregated from other county funds and\nearmarked for a specific purpose. More importantly, the statute\nstates that the fund is to be administered by county attorneys,\n\n\n\n\n                                p. 1512\n\f Honorable Henry Wade - Page 6   (MW-439)\n\n\n\n\n district attorneys. and criminal district attorneys, and that, within\n the limits set out therein, expenditures from the fund are to be made\n at their sole discretion. The express enumeration of particular\n persons or things in a statute is tantamount to an express exclusion\n of all others. Ex parte McIver, 586 S.W.2d 851 (Tex. Crim. App.\n 1979). Thus, by virtue of the express language of the statute, the\n hot check fund is explicitly placed beyond the reach of the\n commissioners court.\n\n      By its terms, article 2368a applies only where a county acts\n \"through its Commissioners Court.\" It follows, in our opinion, that\n the statute is not triggered unless, in making a specific purchase, a\n county acts through its commissioners court. Article 1659a does not\n contain this precise language, but it does state that contracts for\n the purchase of supplies and materials are to be awarded to the party\n who \"in the judgment of the Commissioners Court\" submits the lowest\n and best bid. This is sufficient to convince us that, like article\n 2368a. article 1659a does not come into play where a commissioners\n court is not involved with the purchase in question.\n\n       We have noted that article 53.08 gives the exclusive right to\n  administer the hot check fund, and to make purchases from it, to\n  county attorneys, district attorneys, and criminal district attorneys.\n, Because commissioners courts are without any right to administer the\n  fund or to be involved in making expenditures from it, we conclude,\n  for the reasons set forth above, that articles 2368a and 1659a are\n  inapplicable in this purchasing context. In this respect, it should\n  be noted that to conclude that these statutes are applicable is to\n  give commissioners courts an indirect means of controlling the fund, a\n  result contrary to the express terms of article 53.08 and, therefore,\n  to the legislature's intent.      A commissioners court could, for\n  example, refuse to accept any or all bids in a particular instance and\n  thus interfere with the exclusive right of the designated individuals\n  to administer the fund and to determine when, for what purposes' and\n  under what circumstances expenditures will be made from it.\n\n      Your final category of concern is:\n\n           [The] purchase of law books and law book service,\n           i.e., pocket parts and/or new volumes, where these\n           items are available from only one publishing\n           house.\n\n      You suggest that such items are exempt from competitive bidding\n statutes because they are \"professional services\" rather than\n \"supplies\" or \"materials.\" We disagree. See V.T.C.S. art. 1702h;\n Attorney General Opinion MW-399 (1981). Compare Attorney General\n Opinion MW-344 (1981) with Attorney General Opinion MW-342 (1981).\n You also suggest that the fact that certain books and book services\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 1513\n\f    .\n*       Honorable Henry Wade - Page 7   (Mu-b39)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n        are obtainable only from the source that has a copyright on them is\n        sufficient to render the competitive bidding statutes inapplicable.\n        Support for the latter argument is found in cases from other\n        jurisdictions which hold that bidding statutes are to be read in light\n        of the reason for their enactment, and that they have no application\n        where the nature of the item to be bought is such that competitive\n        bidding is impractical or where the contract to be made would not\n        naturally be - competitive.   See, e.g., Layne-Western Company\n        Buchannan County, 85 F.2d 343 (8th Cir. 1936); Whelan v. New .Jers&\n        Power 6 Light Company, 212 A.2d 136 (N.J. 1965); Schwartz v. Nagel\n        Tires, Inc. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 69 A.2d 885 (NJ. Super.\n        Ct. App. Div. 1949).\n\n             The only Texas case we have found that deals with a patented\n        product, however, is Limestone County v. Knox, 234 S.W. 131 (Tex. Civ.\n        APP. - Dallas 1921, no writ), which involved a contract for patented\n        machinery. The argument was there made that the subject matter of the\n        contract wss such that:\n\n                  competitive proposals would work in incongruity,\n                  would be unavailing as affecting the final result,\n                  and would not produce any advantage....\n\n        -Id. at 132. Nevertheless, the court concluded that:\n                  The language of [article 2368a, V.T.C.S.] is\n                  clear, unambiguous, and emphatic. The legislative\n                  intent and purpose is manifest, and the law should\n                  be observed and given full effect by the\n                  commissioners' courts of      the state...     The\n                  consequences of the failure on the part of the\n                  commissioners' court to comply with... article\n                  2368a... cannot be escaped 'on the theory... that\n                  the subject-matter of the contract of purchase was\n                  a   'patented product    in   the nature    of   a\n                  monopoly...' The fact that the 'subject-matter of\n                  the contract is a patented product' does not\n                  excuse a failure to comply with the terms of the\n                  statute. It is not so provided in the statute,\n                  and we may not look elsewhere for such an excuse.\n\n             The only exceptions to the competitive bidding requirements are\n        those contained in the statutes themselves. We are not in a position\n        to declare the Limestone case obsolete, and we must therefore conclude\n        that under current Texas law, the competitive bidding requirements of\n        articles 1659a and 2368a cannot be avoided on the theory that only one\n        supplier of a desired product exists.\n\n\n\n\n                                        I). 1514\n\fHonorable Henry Wade - Page 8     (Mu-439)\n\n\n\n\n     For these reasons, we conclude that a county must invite bids on\nthe books and services you describe.\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n              Dallas County is required to take competitive\n         bids on materials, supplies, and printing used in\n         the conduct of an election.

When articles 1659a and 2368a and\nthe other statutes cited above are considered together, it becomes\napparent that: (1) competitive bids must be taken on the election\nsupplies you inquire about as per the terms of these statutes; and (2)\nthe commissioners court is responsible for taking these bids and\ndetermining which one is most satisfactory.\n\n     It is true that article 7.07 directs the county election board to\n\"provide the supplies necessary to hold and conduct the election\"' but\nwe find nothing in this provision or in the remainder of the statute\nwhich warrants the conclusion that the other statutes cited above,\nwhich place the responsibility for taking bids on election supplies in\nthe hands of the commissioners court, have been impliedly repealed.\nOn the contrary, we believe article 7.07 is readily reconciled with\nthose statutes. The county election board is to \"provide\" needed\nelection supplies, but in so doing, it is to deal with the suppliers\nselected by the commissioners court through the bidding process. -See\nAttorney General Opinions M-302, M-233 (1968).\n\n     Your second inquiry concerns:\n\n          Items purchased from the 'profits'         of   the\n          commissary operation in the county jail.\n\n     It is our understanding that neither the county nor the sheriff\nactually operates the jail commissary in Dallas county. A private\nvendor does so pursuant to a negotiated arrangement whereby the vendor\npays a fixed sum (based upon prisoner population) and a percentage of\nthe receipts for the concession. The purchase of items for sale, the\nprices to be charged for them, and other similar management decisions\nare left to the concessionaire.

Second, although statutoryauthority\nhas long existed for sheriffs to provide food for prisoners from an\nallowance made by the commissioners court, there is no statute now\nthat allows the sheriff to spend at his discretion any \"profits\"\nrealized from the jail operation.

Thus, by virtue of the express language of the statute, the\n hot check fund is explicitly placed beyond the reach of the\n commissioners court.\n\n      By its terms, article 2368a applies only where a county acts\n \"through its Commissioners Court.\" It follows, in our opinion, that\n the statute is not triggered unless, in making a specific purchase, a\n county acts through its commissioners court. Article 1659a does not\n contain this precise language, but it does state that contracts for\n the purchase of supplies and materials are to be awarded to the party\n who \"in the judgment of the Commissioners Court\" submits the lowest\n and best bid. This is sufficient to convince us that, like article\n 2368a. article 1659a does not come into play where a commissioners\n court is not involved with the purchase in question.\n\n       We have noted that article 53.08 gives the exclusive right to\n  administer the hot check fund, and to make purchases from it, to\n  county attorneys, district attorneys, and criminal district attorneys.\n, Because commissioners courts are without any right to administer the\n  fund or to be involved in making expenditures from it, we conclude,\n  for the reasons set forth above, that articles 2368a and 1659a are\n  inapplicable in this purchasing context. In this respect, it should\n  be noted that to conclude that these statutes are applicable is to\n  give commissioners courts an indirect means of controlling the fund, a\n  result contrary to the express terms of article 53.08 and, therefore,\n  to the legislature's intent.      A commissioners court could, for\n  example, refuse to accept any or all bids in a particular instance and\n  thus interfere with the exclusive right of the designated individuals\n  to administer the fund and to determine when, for what purposes' and\n  under what circumstances expenditures will be made from it.\n\n      Your final category of concern is:\n\n           [The] purchase of law books and law book service,\n           i.e., pocket parts and/or new volumes, where these\n           items are available from only one publishing\n           house.\n\n      You suggest that such items are exempt from competitive bidding\n statutes because they are \"professional services\" rather than\n \"supplies\" or \"materials.\" We disagree. See V.T.C.S. art. 1702h;\n Attorney General Opinion MW-399 (1981). Compare Attorney General\n Opinion MW-344 (1981) with Attorney General Opinion MW-342 (1981).\n You also suggest that the fact that certain books and book services\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 1513\n\f    .\n*       Honorable Henry Wade - Page 7   (Mu-b39)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n        are obtainable only from the source that has a copyright on them is\n        sufficient to render the competitive bidding statutes inapplicable.\n        Support for the latter argument is found in cases from other\n        jurisdictions which hold that bidding statutes are to be read in light\n        of the reason for their enactment, and that they have no application\n        where the nature of the item to be bought is such that competitive\n        bidding is impractical or where the contract to be made would not\n        naturally be - competitive.

Civ.\n        APP. - Dallas 1921, no writ), which involved a contract for patented\n        machinery. The argument was there made that the subject matter of the\n        contract wss such that:\n\n                  competitive proposals would work in incongruity,\n                  would be unavailing as affecting the final result,\n                  and would not produce any advantage....\n\n        -Id. at 132. Nevertheless, the court concluded that:\n                  The language of [article 2368a, V.T.C.S.] is\n                  clear, unambiguous, and emphatic. The legislative\n                  intent and purpose is manifest, and the law should\n                  be observed and given full effect by the\n                  commissioners' courts of      the state...     The\n                  consequences of the failure on the part of the\n                  commissioners' court to comply with... article\n                  2368a... cannot be escaped 'on the theory... that\n                  the subject-matter of the contract of purchase was\n                  a   'patented product    in   the nature    of   a\n                  monopoly...' The fact that the 'subject-matter of\n                  the contract is a patented product' does not\n                  excuse a failure to comply with the terms of the\n                  statute. It is not so provided in the statute,\n                  and we may not look elsewhere for such an excuse.\n\n             The only exceptions to the competitive bidding requirements are\n        those contained in the statutes themselves. We are not in a position\n        to declare the Limestone case obsolete, and we must therefore conclude\n        that under current Texas law, the competitive bidding requirements of\n        articles 1659a and 2368a cannot be avoided on the theory that only one\n        supplier of a desired product exists.\n\n\n\n\n                                        I). 1514\n\fHonorable Henry Wade - Page 8     (Mu-439)\n\n\n\n\n     For these reasons, we conclude that a county must invite bids on\nthe books and services you describe.\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n              Dallas County is required to take competitive\n         bids on materials, supplies, and printing used in\n         the conduct of an election.
