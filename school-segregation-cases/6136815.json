Dale Bay, Emily H.\nMack, LEWIS, THOMASON, KING, KRIEG & WALDROP, Nashville, Tennessee, for\nAppellant.\n\fWYNN, Circuit Judge:\n\n      Defendant Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Company, Inc.\n\n(“Applied Underwriters”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., appeals an order of\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (1) denying Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ motion to compel arbitration and (2) holding that Applied Underwriters\n\nwas judicially estopped from arguing that an agreement between Applied Underwriters\n\nand Plaintiff Minnieland Private Day School, Inc. (“Minnieland”) did not constitute an\n\ninsurance contract for purposes of Virginia law. For the reasons that follow, we conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly denied Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel\n\narbitration. But the district court reversibly erred in applying the doctrine of judicial\n\nestoppel to hold that the agreement constituted an insurance contract. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                            A.\n\n      Minnieland, a provider of child daycare, is required under Virginia law to provide\n\nworkers’ compensation insurance to its employees. In 2013, Minnieland entered into a\n\n“Reinsurance Participation Agreement” (“RPA”) with Applied Underwriters, as part of\n\nMinnieland’s purchase of Applied Underwriters’ “Equity Comp” program, which\n\nApplied Underwriters held out to be a “Worker’s Compensation Program.” J.A. 9.\n\nUnder the RPA, which had a three-year term, one or more “Issuing Insurers”—all of\n\nwhich were affiliates of Applied Underwriters and subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway—\n\n\n                                            2\n\fwould issue workers’ compensation insurance policies to Minnieland. Also pursuant to\n\nthe RPA, Applied Underwriters would establish a “segregated protected cell” through\n\nwhich Minnieland would share in the Issuing Insurers’ profits and losses attributable to\n\nMinnieland’s policies. Following execution of the RPA, Applied Underwriters’ affiliate,\n\nand Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, Continental Indemnity Company (“Continental”)\n\nissued a workers’ compensation policy to Minnieland. The RPA appointed another\n\nBerkshire Hathaway subsidiary as the billing agent for Applied Underwriters and the\n\nIssuing Insurers. Throughout the term of the agreement, Minnieland paid premiums on\n\nthe policy to Applied Underwriters.\n\n       The RPA included an arbitration provision mandating resolution of “any disputes\n\narising under this Agreement” through binding arbitration in the British Virgin Islands\n\nand under the provisions of the American Arbitration Association. J.A. 29–30. In\n\nparticular, the arbitration agreement provided that “[a]ll disputes between the parties\n\nrelating in any way to (1) the execution and delivery, construction or enforceability of\n\nthis Agreement, (2) the management or operations of the Company, or (3) any other\n\nbreach or claimed breach of this Agreement” were subject to mandatory binding\n\narbitration. J.A. 30.\n\n       For the first 33 months of the 36-month term, Minnieland’s monthly premiums\n\naveraged $58,810. But on November 9, 2015, Applied Underwriters billed Minnieland\n\n$471,213, a 1,167% increase from the October 2015 premium and an 801% increase from\n\nthe average premium Minnieland had paid over the first 33 months of the policy. Though\n\nApplied Underwriters refused to disclose the basis for the premium increase, Minnieland\n\n\n                                           3\n\fnevertheless paid the November premium. After Minnieland failed to pay a second\n\nsimilarly large billed premium in December 2015, Applied Underwriters terminated the\n\nEquityComp program—and the Continental workers’ compensation policy, in\n\nparticular—and informed Minnieland that it had a significant outstanding balance on the\n\npolicy.\n\n                                           B.\n\n          On December 24, 2015, Minnieland filed suit against Applied Underwriters in\n\nfederal district court, alleging that Applied Underwriters engaged in the business of\n\ninsurance in Virginia without complying with Virginia insurance and workers’\n\ncompensation laws. In particular, Minnieland alleged that the RPA amounted to an\n\n“insurance contract,” not a “reinsurance” agreement, and therefore constituted an\n\nunlawful “attempt to circumvent” various Virginia laws related to insurance and workers’\n\ncompensation. J.A. 12–13. The complaint also alleged that the arbitration provisions in\n\nthe RPA violated Virginia insurance law. Minnieland sought a declaration (1) that the\n\nRPA constituted an insurance contract and was void due to Applied Underwriters’ failure\n\nto comply with Virginia law; (2) as to what amount, if any, Minnieland owed Applied\n\nUnderwriters under the RPA; and (3) that the premiums, deposits, and charges assessed\n\nby Applied Underwriters were excessive. Minnieland also sought damages for fraud and\n\nbreach of contract.\n\n          On January 21, 2016, Applied Underwriters moved to compel arbitration. In\n\nresponse, Minnieland argued that under Virginia law “no provision of any insurance\n\ncontract can . . . deprive ‘the courts of this Commonwealth of jurisdiction in actions\n\n\n                                           4\n\fagainst the insurer,’” rendering any arbitration provision in the RPA “‘void.’” J.A. 85, 88\n\n(quoting Va. Code Ann. § 38.2–312). Applied Underwriters replied that, because the\n\nRPA delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator, the arbitrator had exclusive\n\nauthority to decide whether the RPA constituted an “insurance contract” subject to\n\nSection 38.2–312’s prohibition on mandatory arbitration of disputes involving such\n\ncontracts. The district court initially granted Applied Underwriters’ motion, holding that\n\n“the arbitration provision in the [RPA] requires that an arbitrator decide whether the\n\nparties’ contract is subject to Va. Code § 38.2–312.” Minnieland Private Day School,\n\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., No. 1:15–cv–1695, 2016 WL\n\n7199729, at *1 (E.D. Va. Mar. 17, 2016). The district court’s initial order included the\n\nfollowing note:\n\n       In order to avoid unnecessary and unwarranted delay and expense, the\n       Court urges Applied to consider whether, given the underlying merits of the\n       issue to be arbitrated, the rulings already obtained in arbitration concerning\n       whether the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance” (as advocated for by\n       Applied), and the positions Applied has taken in other proceedings\n       concerning whether the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance,” Applied can\n       continue to advocate in good faith before an arbitrator and without running\n       afoul of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 that the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance” and\n       therefore not a “contract of insurance” subject to Va. Code § 38.2–312.\n\nId. at *3 n.6\n\n       Minnieland moved for reconsideration, again arguing that Section 38.2–312\n\nrendered void “any” arbitration provision in the RPA and, therefore, that “[t]he court\n\nmust resolve the validity of the arbitration provision.” J.A. 208-09. Minnieland also\n\nattached to its motion additional materials from other regulatory and legal proceedings in\n\nwhich Applied Underwriters or its affiliates had either refused to dispute or conceded that\n\n\n                                             5\n\fthe RPA constituted an insurance contract for purposes of various other state laws. The\n\ndistrict court orally granted Minnieland’s motion, concluding that Applied Underwriters\n\nwas judicially estopped from arguing that the RPA did not constitute a “contract of\n\ninsurance.” J.A. 465. As a result, the court observed that there was no “arbitrable issue\n\nto be submitted to the arbitrator under the RPA.” J.A. 465. The district court further\n\nconcluded that “Applied’s assertion in this action that the RPA is not a contract of\n\ninsurance but rather a contract of reinsurance must be viewed as an attempt to gain an\n\nunfair advantage in this proceeding by delaying what ultimately must be addressed by the\n\nCourt and diverting this case procedurally to an arbitrable forum that is to play no role\n\nunder the applicable Virginia law in deciding the merits of plaintiff’s claims.” J.A. 466.\n\n       Applied Underwriters timely appealed, arguing that the district court (1) reversibly\n\nerred in denying Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel arbitration and (2) incorrectly\n\nheld that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred Applied Underwriters from asserting that\n\nthe RPA does not constitute a “contract of insurance” for purposes of Virginia law. We\n\nhold that the district court correctly denied Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel\n\narbitration, but incorrectly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel in holding that the\n\nRPA constitutes an “insurance contract” for purposes of Section 38.2–312.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       This Court reviews de novo a district court’s order denying a motion to compel\n\narbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. See Noohi v. Toll Bros., 708 F.3d 599, 605\n\n(4th Cir. 2013).   That statute provides that “[a] written provision in . . . a contract\n\nevidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\n\nsave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9\n\nU.S.C. § 2. The Federal Arbitration Act generally preempts state laws limiting the\n\nenforceability of arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 352–\n\n53 (2008).\n\n       However, the federal McCarran-Ferguson Act endows states with plenary\n\nauthority over the regulation of insurance and provides that “[n]o Act of Congress shall\n\nbe construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the\n\npurpose of regulating the business of insurance.” 15 U.S.C. § 1012. “Thus, McCarran-\n\nFerguson authorizes ‘reverse preemption’ of generally applicable federal statutes by state\n\nlaws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.” ESAB Grp., Inc. v.\n\nZurich Ins. PLC, 685 F.3d 376, 380 (4th Cir. 2012).           In other words, state laws\n\ninvalidating arbitration agreements in insurance policies “reverse preempt[]” the Federal\n\nArbitration Act. E.g., Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Inman, 436 F.3d 490, 494 (5th Cir.\n\n2006) (holding that Mississippi statute prohibiting required arbitration of disputes\n\nstemming from uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage provisions of personal\n\nautomobile insurance policies reverse preempts Federal Arbitration Act); Am. Health &\n\nLife Ins. Co. v. Heyward, 272 F. Supp. 2d 578, 582 (D.S.C. 2003) (holding that South\n\nCarolina law prohibiting mandatory arbitration provisions in insurance contracts reverse\n\npreempts the Federal Arbitration Act).\n\n       Virginia law, which the parties agree governs the present dispute, provides that\n\n“[n]o insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth and\n\n\n                                            7\n\fcovering subjects which are located or residing in this Commonwealth . . . shall contain\n\nany condition, stipulation or agreement . . . [d]epriving the courts of this Commonwealth\n\nof jurisdiction in actions against the insurer,” and that “[a]ny such condition, stipulation\n\nor agreement shall be void.” Va. Code Ann. § 38.2–312. The district court concluded—\n\nand we agree—that Section 38.2–312 renders void mandatory arbitration provisions in\n\n“insurance contracts” governed by Virginia law.          Minnieland, 2016 WL 7199729,\n\nat *1, *3.\n\n       On appeal, Applied Underwriters does not contend that Section 38.2–312 does not\n\ngenerally reverse preempt the Federal Arbitration Act. Rather, Applied Underwriters\n\nargues that the district court improperly determined that Section 38.2–312 reverse\n\npreempts the arbitration provisions in the RPA because the RPA included a so-called\n\n“delegation provision,” which expressly delegated the authority to resolve questions of\n\narbitrability to the arbitrator. In particular, Applied Underwriters asserts that the district\n\ncourt improperly concluded that the RPA constituted an “insurance contract” for\n\npurposes of Section 38.2–312, when the RPA left that question of arbitrability to the\n\narbitrator.\n\n       Applied Underwriters arbitrability argument principally rests on the Supreme\n\nCourt’s opinion in Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63 (2010). There, the\n\narbitration agreement between the defendant, Rent-A-Center, and the plaintiff, Jackson,\n\nprovided that “[t]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall\n\nhave exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,\n\nenforceability or formation of this Agreement.” 561 U.S. at 66 (alteration in original)\n\n\n                                              8\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted). Jackson sought to avoid the arbitration agreement on\n\ngrounds of unconscionability, arguing that the mandatory arbitration provision was one-\n\nsided and involved unfair procedures limiting discovery and requiring fee-splitting. Id. at\n\n73–74. Below, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the agreement unambiguously gave the\n\narbitrator exclusive authority to resolve questions of arbitrability. Jackson v. Rent-A-\n\nCenter West, Inc., 581 F.3d 912, 917 (9th Cir. 2009), rev’d, 561 U.S. 63 (2010).\n\nNonetheless, the Ninth Circuit held that when “a party challenges an arbitration\n\nagreement as unconscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to\n\nthe agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court.” Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Ninth Circuit’s analysis improperly\n\nfocused on the unconscionability of the arbitration agreement and not the delegation\n\nprovision, which provided the arbitrator exclusive authority to resolve questions of\n\narbitrability.   See Rent-A-Center, 561 U.S. at 72–74.      “An agreement to arbitrate a\n\ngateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent agreement the party seeking arbitration\n\nasks the federal court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional arbitration\n\nagreement just as it does on any other,” the Court explained.         Id. at 70.    Because\n\nJackson’s unconscionability arguments focused on “the entire arbitration agreement”—\n\nand not the delegation provision, in particular—the unchallenged delegation provision\n\ngranted the arbitrator exclusive authority to determine whether the arbitration agreement\n\nwas unconscionable. Id. at 72–74.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       Rent-A-Center makes clear, however, that “[i]f a party challenges the validity\n\nunder § 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider\n\nthe challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under § 4.” Id. at 71.\n\nAccordingly, because delegation provisions constitute “an additional, antecedent\n\nagreement” to arbitrate, such provisions are “valid under § 2 ‘save upon such grounds as\n\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’” Id. at 69–70 (quoting 9\n\nU.S.C. § 2).    Federal courts, therefore, “must consider” challenges to delegation\n\nprovisions “before ordering compliance with [such provisions].” Id. at 71. To that end,\n\nRent-A-Center provides an illustration of how Jackson could have argued that the\n\ndelegation provision, as opposed to the arbitration agreement as a whole, was\n\n“unconscionable”—and therefore unenforceable—because of the limitations on arbitral\n\ndiscovery and the fee-splitting procedures:\n\n       To make such a claim based on the discovery procedures, Jackson would\n       have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes\n       the arbitration of his claim that the [arbitration] Agreement is unenforceable\n       to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a much more difficult\n       argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders\n       arbitration of his factbound employment-discrimination claim\n       unconscionable. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting arrangement\n       may be more difficult to establish for the arbitration of enforceability than\n       for arbitration of more complex and fact-related aspects of the alleged\n       employment discrimination.\n\nId. at 74.\n\n        Accordingly, under Rent-A-Center, we first must decide whether Minnieland\n\nlodged a challenge against the delegation provision in the RPA, in particular. Second, if\n\nwe conclude that Minnieland specifically challenged the enforceability of the delegation\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fprovision, we then must decide whether the delegation provision is unenforceable “upon\n\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n       Regarding the first question, Applied Underwriters argues that Minnieland, like\n\nthe plaintiff in Rent-A-Center, failed to specifically challenge the delegation provision in\n\nthe RPA. But before the district court, Minnieland argued that Section 38.2-312 rendered\n\nvoid “any” arbitration provision in the RPA, J.A. 208-09 (emphasis added), necessarily\n\nincluding the delegation provision, which is simply “an additional, antecedent\n\nagreement” to arbitrate, Rent-A-Center, 561 U.S. at 70; see also J.A. at 85, 88 (arguing\n\nthat under Virginia law “no provision of any insurance contract can . . . deprive ‘the\n\ncourts of this Commonwealth of jurisdiction in actions against the insurer,’” rendering\n\nany arbitration provision in the RPA “‘void’” (quoting Va. Code Ann. § 38.2–312)\n\n(emphasis added)). And to avoid any doubt that its challenge to the enforceability of the\n\narbitration agreements in the RPA extended to the delegation provision, Minnieland\n\nexpressly asserted that, under Section 38.2–312, “[t]he court must resolve the validity of\n\nthe arbitration provision,” an argument relevant only to the enforceability of the\n\ndelegation provision.     J.A. 208-09 (emphasis added).          Accordingly, Minnieland\n\n“challenged the validity of that delegation with sufficient force and specificity” to satisfy\n\nRent-A-Center. Hayes v. Delbert Servs. Corp., 811 F.3d 666, 671 n.1 (4th Cir. 2016).\n\n       Applied Underwriters nevertheless argues that Minnieland failed to adequately\n\ncontest the enforceability of the delegation provision because its complaint did not\n\n“specifically challenge” the delegation provision. Appellant’s Br. at 5; Appellant’s Reply\n\nBr. at 7–8.    But a defendant who seeks to compel arbitration under the Federal\n\n\n                                             11\n\fArbitration Act bears the burden of establishing the existence of a binding contract to\n\narbitrate the dispute. See Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., 303 F.3d 496, 500–01 (4th Cir.\n\n2002). And until a defendant moves to compel arbitration, there is no reason for a\n\nplaintiff to assert any grounds for disregarding an arbitration agreement. Accordingly,\n\nthe absence of allegations in Minnieland’s complaint challenging the enforceability of the\n\ndelegation provision has no bearing on whether the district court properly denied Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ motion to compel arbitration.\n\n       Having concluded that Minnieland challenged the enforceability of the delegation\n\nprovision, we now determine whether the delegation provision is unenforceable “upon\n\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity.” 9 U.S.C. § 2. For several reasons, we\n\nconclude that Section 38.2–312 renders invalid delegation provisions in putative\n\ninsurance contracts governed by Virginia law, at least to the extent such delegation\n\nprovisions endow an arbitrator, as opposed to a court, with exclusive authority to\n\ndetermine whether the contract at issue constitutes an “insurance contract” for purposes\n\nof Virginia law. 1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion as to whether Section 38.2–\n312 renders invalid a putative insurance contract’s delegation of other gateway issues to\narbitrators. Likewise, we express no opinion as to whether questions, gateway or\notherwise, of judicial estoppel—a doctrine applied “to protect the integrity of the judicial\nprocess” and “to prevent improper use of judicial machinery”—are ever delegable to\narbitrators. New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749–50 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (4th Cir. 1982) (holding\nthat judicial estoppel “protect[s] the essential integrity of the judicial process”).\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       To begin, we find it significant that Virginia chose to treat arbitration provisions in\n\ninsurance contracts as “void.” Va. Code § 38.2–312. Under Virginia law, when a\n\nprovision in an insurance contract is “void,” it is “unenforceable from its inception.”\n\nLiverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Bolling, 10 S.E.2d 518, 522 (Va. 1940); see also\n\nJoseph M. Perrillo, Calamari and Perrillo on Contracts § 1.8(b) (6th ed. 2009) (“A\n\ncontract is void, a contradiction in terms, when it produces no legal obligation. . . . It\n\nwould be more exact to say that no contract was created.”). If an agreement including a\n\ndelegation provision constitutes an “insurance contract,” the delegation provision—an\n\n“additional, antecedent agreement” to arbitrate, Rent-A-Center,         561 U.S. at 70—is\n\n“unenforceable from its inception.”        Thus, Virginia’s decision to treat delegation\n\nprovisions in insurance contracts as void constitutes “grounds as exist at law . . . for the\n\nrevocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n       We also reach this conclusion because Section 38.2–312 reflects a state policy\n\nchoice that insureds should have the option to seek enforcement of Virginia’s insurance\n\nlaws and regulations in court, rather than through arbitration. Enforcing contractual\n\nprovisions that provide arbitrators with exclusive authority to determine whether a\n\ncontract amounts to a “contract of insurance”—a term defined by Virginia law—would\n\nundermine that purpose by giving the arbitrators exclusive authority over a core question\n\nof Virginia insurance law. Indeed, were an arbitrator to incorrectly determine that a\n\ncontract was not an “insurance contract” for purposes of Virginia law and move forward\n\nwith arbitration of the underlying dispute—or to correctly conclude that a contract was an\n\ninsurance contract and then incorrectly move forward with arbitration of the underlying\n\n\n                                             13\n\fdispute—a Virginia insured would be deprived of recourse to the judiciary to resolve a\n\ndispute over the interpretation of an insurance contract governed by Virginia law, the\n\nprecise outcome Virginia sought to prevent in enacting Section 38.2–312.\n\n      Applied Underwriters argues that this conclusion places this Court in conflict with\n\nthe Third and Sixth Circuits, which have held that questions of arbitrability of RPAs\n\nbetween Applied Underwriters and other Equity Comp customers—and governed by\n\ndifferent state laws—were for the arbitrator to resolve. See S. Jersey Sanitation Co. v.\n\nApplied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., 840 F.3d 138, 146 (3d Cir. 2016);\n\nMilan Express Co. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., 590 Fed. App’x\n\n482, 486 (6th Cir. 2014). We disagree. Neither South Jersey Sanitation nor Milan\n\nExpress considered—much less decided—whether the relevant state insurance laws\n\nrendered unenforceable the delegation provision in the RPA—the question we resolve\n\nhere. Accordingly, South Jersey Sanitation and Milan Express are inapposite to whether\n\nSection 38.2–312 renders void delegation provisions in putative insurance contracts\n\ngoverned by Virginia law.\n\n      In sum, because Section 38.2–312 renders void delegation provisions in putative\n\ninsurance contracts—at least to the extent such provisions authorize an arbitrator to\n\nresolve whether the contract at issue constitutes an “insurance contract”—we conclude\n\nthat the district court did not reversibly err in denying Applied Underwriters’ motion to\n\ncompel arbitration.\n\n                                           B.\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f        Having concluded that the court, not an arbitrator, should determine whether the\n\nRPA constitutes an insurance contract for purposes of Virginia law, we now must decide\n\nwhether the district court properly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel to preclude\n\nApplied Underwriters from taking the position that the RPA is not an insurance contract.\n\nThis Court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court’s application of the equitable\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel. See King v. Herbert J. Thomas Mem’l Hosp., 159 F.3d 192,\n\n196 (4th Cir. 1998) (“As an equitable doctrine, judicial estoppel is invoked in the\n\ndiscretion of the district court . . . .”).\n\n        “Judicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a position that is inconsistent\n\nwith a stance taken in prior litigation.” John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert & Frieden, P.C., 65\n\nF.3d 26, 28 (4th Cir. 1995). “The purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a party from\n\nplaying fast and loose with the courts, and to protect the essential integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.” Id. at 29 (internal quotation marks omitted). “Even so, courts must apply the\n\ndoctrine with caution.” Id.\n\n        To that end, this Court has identified four elements that must be met before a court\n\nmay apply judicial estoppel: (1) “the party sought to be estopped must be seeking to\n\nadopt a position that is inconsistent with a stance taken in prior litigation;” (2) “the\n\nposition sought to be estopped must be one of fact rather than law or legal theory;”\n\n(3) “the prior inconsistent position must have been accepted by the court;” and (4) “the\n\nparty sought to be estopped must have intentionally misled the court to gain unfair\n\nadvantage.” Lowery v. Stovall, 92 F.3d 219, 223–24 (4th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). We have characterized the final element as “determinative.” Id. at 224\n\n\n                                              15\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this test, we conclude that the district court\n\ncommitted legal error in applying judicial estoppel and, therefore, abused its discretion.\n\nSee League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 235 (4th Cir.\n\n2014) (“A district court abuses its discretion when it misapprehends or misapplies the\n\napplicable law.”).\n\n       With respect the first element, the district court concluded that Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ position that “the RPA is a contract of reinsurance and not a contract of\n\ninsurance” was “inconsistent with those [positions] asserted in other legal proceedings.”\n\nJ.A. 465. But none of the other proceedings in which Applied Underwriters allegedly\n\ntook an inconsistent position involved whether the RPA constituted an “insurance\n\ncontract” for purposes of Virginia law—the question at issue here. Therefore, Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ assertion that the RPA is not an insurance contract for purposes of Virginia\n\nlaw is not inconsistent with its legal position in any of those cases. Additionally, in\n\nseveral cases, Applied Underwriters has argued expressly that the RPA did not constitute\n\nan insurance contract for purposes of the relevant state law. See S. Jersey Sanitation, 840\n\nF.3d at 141 (stating that Applied Underwriters argued that, under Nebraska law, the RPA\n\n“was not a workers’ compensation insurance policy, but rather an investment\n\ninstrument[,] . . . a contract relating [to] or concerning a reinsurance policy” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Milan Express Co. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk\n\nAssurance Co., 993 F. Supp. 2d 846, 856 (W.D. Tenn.) (noting that, “[a]ccording to\n\n[Applied Underwriters], . . . the RPA does not concern or relate to a policy of insurance\n\nand therefore is outside the scope of” the Nebraska state statute prohibiting mandatory\n\n\n                                            16\n\farbitration provisions in insurance contracts (internal quotation marks omitted)), vacated\n\nand remanded on other grounds, 590 Fed. App’x 482 (2014). Accordingly, Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ position in this case is entirely consistent with the position it has taken in\n\nseveral other cases.\n\n       The second element—that judicial estoppel may only be applied when the position\n\nsought to be estopped is one of fact rather than law—also is not met in this case. Here,\n\nApplied Underwriters’ position is that the RPA does not constitute an insurance contract\n\nfor purposes of Virginia law. Under Virginia law, the interpretation of a contract—and\n\nan insurance contract, in particular—presents a question of law. See PBM Nutritionals,\n\nLLC v. Lexington Ins. Co., 724 S.E.2d 707, 712–13 (Va. 2012). Likewise, the meaning\n\nof “insurance contract” in Section 38.2–312 poses a question of law. See Conyers v.\n\nMartial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (Va. 2007) (“[A]n issue of\n\nstatutory interpretation is a pure question of law . . . .”). Accordingly, the position at\n\nissue is one of law, rather than fact.\n\n       Regarding the third and fourth elements—judicial reliance and intent to mislead to\n\ngain an unfair advantage—each of those elements necessarily contemplate that the\n\nposition at issue is inconsistent with a position taken by the party in earlier litigation.\n\nBecause Applied Underwriters’ assertion that the RPA does not constitute an “insurance\n\ncontract” for purposes of Section 38.2–312 is not inconsistent with any position taken by\n\nApplied Underwriters in previous proceedings, see supra, the third and fourth elements\n\nalso do not support application of judicial estoppel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                                            III.\n\n       In sum, the district court correctly denied Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel\n\narbitration, but incorrectly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel in holding that the\n\nRPA constitutes an “insurance contract” for purposes of Section 38.2–312. The parties\n\nhave not had the opportunity to fully brief and argue whether, if judicial estoppel does not\n\napply, the RPA is an insurance contract under Virginia law. As such, we remand for\n\nconsideration of that issue in the first instance and further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n                                                                    AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                                                    REVERSED IN PART,\n                                                                      AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f",

(“Minnieland”) did not constitute an\n\ninsurance contract for purposes of Virginia law. For the reasons that follow, we conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly denied Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel\n\narbitration. But the district court reversibly erred in applying the doctrine of judicial\n\nestoppel to hold that the agreement constituted an insurance contract. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                            A.\n\n      Minnieland, a provider of child daycare, is required under Virginia law to provide\n\nworkers’ compensation insurance to its employees. In 2013, Minnieland entered into a\n\n“Reinsurance Participation Agreement” (“RPA”) with Applied Underwriters, as part of\n\nMinnieland’s purchase of Applied Underwriters’ “Equity Comp” program, which\n\nApplied Underwriters held out to be a “Worker’s Compensation Program.” J.A. 9.\n\nUnder the RPA, which had a three-year term, one or more “Issuing Insurers”—all of\n\nwhich were affiliates of Applied Underwriters and subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway—\n\n\n                                            2\n\fwould issue workers’ compensation insurance policies to Minnieland. Also pursuant to\n\nthe RPA, Applied Underwriters would establish a “segregated protected cell” through\n\nwhich Minnieland would share in the Issuing Insurers’ profits and losses attributable to\n\nMinnieland’s policies. Following execution of the RPA, Applied Underwriters’ affiliate,\n\nand Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, Continental Indemnity Company (“Continental”)\n\nissued a workers’ compensation policy to Minnieland. The RPA appointed another\n\nBerkshire Hathaway subsidiary as the billing agent for Applied Underwriters and the\n\nIssuing Insurers. Throughout the term of the agreement, Minnieland paid premiums on\n\nthe policy to Applied Underwriters.\n\n       The RPA included an arbitration provision mandating resolution of “any disputes\n\narising under this Agreement” through binding arbitration in the British Virgin Islands\n\nand under the provisions of the American Arbitration Association. J.A. 29–30. In\n\nparticular, the arbitration agreement provided that “[a]ll disputes between the parties\n\nrelating in any way to (1) the execution and delivery, construction or enforceability of\n\nthis Agreement, (2) the management or operations of the Company, or (3) any other\n\nbreach or claimed breach of this Agreement” were subject to mandatory binding\n\narbitration. J.A. 30.\n\n       For the first 33 months of the 36-month term, Minnieland’s monthly premiums\n\naveraged $58,810. But on November 9, 2015, Applied Underwriters billed Minnieland\n\n$471,213, a 1,167% increase from the October 2015 premium and an 801% increase from\n\nthe average premium Minnieland had paid over the first 33 months of the policy. Though\n\nApplied Underwriters refused to disclose the basis for the premium increase, Minnieland\n\n\n                                           3\n\fnevertheless paid the November premium. After Minnieland failed to pay a second\n\nsimilarly large billed premium in December 2015, Applied Underwriters terminated the\n\nEquityComp program—and the Continental workers’ compensation policy, in\n\nparticular—and informed Minnieland that it had a significant outstanding balance on the\n\npolicy.\n\n                                           B.\n\n          On December 24, 2015, Minnieland filed suit against Applied Underwriters in\n\nfederal district court, alleging that Applied Underwriters engaged in the business of\n\ninsurance in Virginia without complying with Virginia insurance and workers’\n\ncompensation laws. In particular, Minnieland alleged that the RPA amounted to an\n\n“insurance contract,” not a “reinsurance” agreement, and therefore constituted an\n\nunlawful “attempt to circumvent” various Virginia laws related to insurance and workers’\n\ncompensation. J.A. 12–13. The complaint also alleged that the arbitration provisions in\n\nthe RPA violated Virginia insurance law. Minnieland sought a declaration (1) that the\n\nRPA constituted an insurance contract and was void due to Applied Underwriters’ failure\n\nto comply with Virginia law; (2) as to what amount, if any, Minnieland owed Applied\n\nUnderwriters under the RPA; and (3) that the premiums, deposits, and charges assessed\n\nby Applied Underwriters were excessive. Minnieland also sought damages for fraud and\n\nbreach of contract.\n\n          On January 21, 2016, Applied Underwriters moved to compel arbitration. In\n\nresponse, Minnieland argued that under Virginia law “no provision of any insurance\n\ncontract can . . . deprive ‘the courts of this Commonwealth of jurisdiction in actions\n\n\n                                           4\n\fagainst the insurer,’” rendering any arbitration provision in the RPA “‘void.’” J.A. 85, 88\n\n(quoting Va. Code Ann. § 38.2–312). Applied Underwriters replied that, because the\n\nRPA delegated questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator, the arbitrator had exclusive\n\nauthority to decide whether the RPA constituted an “insurance contract” subject to\n\nSection 38.2–312’s prohibition on mandatory arbitration of disputes involving such\n\ncontracts. The district court initially granted Applied Underwriters’ motion, holding that\n\n“the arbitration provision in the [RPA] requires that an arbitrator decide whether the\n\nparties’ contract is subject to Va. Code § 38.2–312.” Minnieland Private Day School,\n\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., No. 1:15–cv–1695, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">7199729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (E.D. Va. Mar. 17, 2016). The district court’s initial order included the\n\nfollowing note:\n\n       In order to avoid unnecessary and unwarranted delay and expense, the\n       Court urges Applied to consider whether, given the underlying merits of the\n       issue to be arbitrated, the rulings already obtained in arbitration concerning\n       whether the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance” (as advocated for by\n       Applied), and the positions Applied has taken in other proceedings\n       concerning whether the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance,” Applied can\n       continue to advocate in good faith before an arbitrator and without running\n       afoul of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 that the RPA is a “contract of reinsurance” and\n       therefore not a “contract of insurance” subject to Va. Code § 38.2–312.\n\nId. at *3 n.6\n\n       Minnieland moved for reconsideration, again arguing that Section 38.2–312\n\nrendered void “any” arbitration provision in the RPA and, therefore, that “[t]he court\n\nmust resolve the validity of the arbitration provision.” J.A. 208-09. Minnieland also\n\nattached to its motion additional materials from other regulatory and legal proceedings in\n\nwhich Applied Underwriters or its affiliates had either refused to dispute or conceded that\n\n\n                                             5\n\fthe RPA constituted an insurance contract for purposes of various other state laws. The\n\ndistrict court orally granted Minnieland’s motion, concluding that Applied Underwriters\n\nwas judicially estopped from arguing that the RPA did not constitute a “contract of\n\ninsurance.” J.A. 465. As a result, the court observed that there was no “arbitrable issue\n\nto be submitted to the arbitrator under the RPA.” J.A. 465. The district court further\n\nconcluded that “Applied’s assertion in this action that the RPA is not a contract of\n\ninsurance but rather a contract of reinsurance must be viewed as an attempt to gain an\n\nunfair advantage in this proceeding by delaying what ultimately must be addressed by the\n\nCourt and diverting this case procedurally to an arbitrable forum that is to play no role\n\nunder the applicable Virginia law in deciding the merits of plaintiff’s claims.” J.A. 466.\n\n       Applied Underwriters timely appealed, arguing that the district court (1) reversibly\n\nerred in denying Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel arbitration and (2) incorrectly\n\nheld that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred Applied Underwriters from asserting that\n\nthe RPA does not constitute a “contract of insurance” for purposes of Virginia law. We\n\nhold that the district court correctly denied Applied Underwriters’ motion to compel\n\narbitration, but incorrectly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel in holding that the\n\nRPA constitutes an “insurance contract” for purposes of Section 38.2–312.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       This Court reviews de novo a district court’s order denying a motion to compel\n\narbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.

In particular, Applied Underwriters asserts that the district\n\ncourt improperly concluded that the RPA constituted an “insurance contract” for\n\npurposes of Section 38.2–312, when the RPA left that question of arbitrability to the\n\narbitrator.\n\n       Applied Underwriters arbitrability argument principally rests on the Supreme\n\nCourt’s opinion in Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149007\"><a href=\"/opinion/149007/rent-a-center-west-inc-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010). There, the\n\narbitration agreement between the defendant, Rent-A-Center, and the plaintiff, Jackson,\n\nprovided that “[t]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall\n\nhave exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,\n\nenforceability or formation of this Agreement.” 561 U.S. at 66 (alteration in original)\n\n\n                                              8\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted). Jackson sought to avoid the arbitration agreement on\n\ngrounds of unconscionability, arguing that the mandatory arbitration provision was one-\n\nsided and involved unfair procedures limiting discovery and requiring fee-splitting. Id. at\n\n73–74. Below, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the agreement unambiguously gave the\n\narbitrator exclusive authority to resolve questions of arbitrability. Jackson v. Rent-A-\n\nCenter West, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1266270\"><a href=\"/opinion/1266270/jackson-v-rent-a-center-west-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (9th Cir. 2009), rev’d, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149007\"><a href=\"/opinion/149007/rent-a-center-west-inc-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010).\n\nNonetheless, the Ninth Circuit held that when “a party challenges an arbitration\n\nagreement as unconscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to\n\nthe agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court.” Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Ninth Circuit’s analysis improperly\n\nfocused on the unconscionability of the arbitration agreement and not the delegation\n\nprovision, which provided the arbitrator exclusive authority to resolve questions of\n\narbitrability.   See Rent-A-Center, 561 U.S. at 72–74.      “An agreement to arbitrate a\n\ngateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent agreement the party seeking arbitration\n\nasks the federal court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional arbitration\n\nagreement just as it does on any other,” the Court explained.         Id. at 70.    Because\n\nJackson’s unconscionability arguments focused on “the entire arbitration agreement”—\n\nand not the delegation provision, in particular—the unchallenged delegation provision\n\ngranted the arbitrator exclusive authority to determine whether the arbitration agreement\n\nwas unconscionable. Id. at 72–74.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       Rent-A-Center makes clear, however, that “[i]f a party challenges the validity\n\nunder § 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider\n\nthe challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under § 4.” Id. at 71.\n\nAccordingly, because delegation provisions constitute “an additional, antecedent\n\nagreement” to arbitrate, such provisions are “valid under § 2 ‘save upon such grounds as\n\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’” Id. at 69–70 (quoting 9\n\nU.S.C. § 2).    Federal courts, therefore, “must consider” challenges to delegation\n\nprovisions “before ordering compliance with [such provisions].” Id. at 71. To that end,\n\nRent-A-Center provides an illustration of how Jackson could have argued that the\n\ndelegation provision, as opposed to the arbitration agreement as a whole, was\n\n“unconscionable”—and therefore unenforceable—because of the limitations on arbitral\n\ndiscovery and the fee-splitting procedures:\n\n       To make such a claim based on the discovery procedures, Jackson would\n       have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes\n       the arbitration of his claim that the [arbitration] Agreement is unenforceable\n       to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a much more difficult\n       argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders\n       arbitration of his factbound employment-discrimination claim\n       unconscionable. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting arrangement\n       may be more difficult to establish for the arbitration of enforceability than\n       for arbitration of more complex and fact-related aspects of the alleged\n       employment discrimination.\n\nId. at 74.\n\n        Accordingly, under Rent-A-Center, we first must decide whether Minnieland\n\nlodged a challenge against the delegation provision in the RPA, in particular. Second, if\n\nwe conclude that Minnieland specifically challenged the enforceability of the delegation\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fprovision, we then must decide whether the delegation provision is unenforceable “upon\n\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n       Regarding the first question, Applied Underwriters argues that Minnieland, like\n\nthe plaintiff in Rent-A-Center, failed to specifically challenge the delegation provision in\n\nthe RPA. But before the district court, Minnieland argued that Section 38.2-312 rendered\n\nvoid “any” arbitration provision in the RPA, J.A. 208-09 (emphasis added), necessarily\n\nincluding the delegation provision, which is simply “an additional, antecedent\n\nagreement” to arbitrate, Rent-A-Center, 561 U.S. at 70; see also J.A. at 85, 88 (arguing\n\nthat under Virginia law “no provision of any insurance contract can . . . deprive ‘the\n\ncourts of this Commonwealth of jurisdiction in actions against the insurer,’” rendering\n\nany arbitration provision in the RPA “‘void’” (quoting Va. Code Ann. § 38.2–312)\n\n(emphasis added)). And to avoid any doubt that its challenge to the enforceability of the\n\narbitration agreements in the RPA extended to the delegation provision, Minnieland\n\nexpressly asserted that, under Section 38.2–312, “[t]he court must resolve the validity of\n\nthe arbitration provision,” an argument relevant only to the enforceability of the\n\ndelegation provision.     J.A. 208-09 (emphasis added).          Accordingly, Minnieland\n\n“challenged the validity of that delegation with sufficient force and specificity” to satisfy\n\nRent-A-Center. Hayes v. Delbert Servs. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 n.1 (4th Cir. 2016).\n\n       Applied Underwriters nevertheless argues that Minnieland failed to adequately\n\ncontest the enforceability of the delegation provision because its complaint did not\n\n“specifically challenge” the delegation provision. Appellant’s Br. at 5; Appellant’s Reply\n\nBr. at 7–8.    But a defendant who seeks to compel arbitration under the Federal\n\n\n                                             11\n\fArbitration Act bears the burden of establishing the existence of a binding contract to\n\narbitrate the dispute. See Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779113\"><a href=\"/opinion/779113/curtis-m-adkins-and-lee-ayers-angelo-bailey-daniel-ballengee-bobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500–01 (4th Cir.\n\n2002). And until a defendant moves to compel arbitration, there is no reason for a\n\nplaintiff to assert any grounds for disregarding an arbitration agreement. Accordingly,\n\nthe absence of allegations in Minnieland’s complaint challenging the enforceability of the\n\ndelegation provision has no bearing on whether the district court properly denied Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ motion to compel arbitration.\n\n       Having concluded that Minnieland challenged the enforceability of the delegation\n\nprovision, we now determine whether the delegation provision is unenforceable “upon\n\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity.” 9 U.S.C. § 2. For several reasons, we\n\nconclude that Section 38.2–312 renders invalid delegation provisions in putative\n\ninsurance contracts governed by Virginia law, at least to the extent such delegation\n\nprovisions endow an arbitrator, as opposed to a court, with exclusive authority to\n\ndetermine whether the contract at issue constitutes an “insurance contract” for purposes\n\nof Virginia law. 1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion as to whether Section 38.2–\n312 renders invalid a putative insurance contract’s delegation of other gateway issues to\narbitrators. Likewise, we express no opinion as to whether questions, gateway or\notherwise, of judicial estoppel—a doctrine applied “to protect the integrity of the judicial\nprocess” and “to prevent improper use of judicial machinery”—are ever delegable to\narbitrators.

Code § 38.2–312. Under Virginia law, when a\n\nprovision in an insurance contract is “void,” it is “unenforceable from its inception.”\n\nLiverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Bolling, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (Va. 1940); see also\n\nJoseph M. Perrillo, Calamari and Perrillo on Contracts § 1.8(b) (6th ed. 2009) (“A\n\ncontract is void, a contradiction in terms, when it produces no legal obligation. . . . It\n\nwould be more exact to say that no contract was created.”). If an agreement including a\n\ndelegation provision constitutes an “insurance contract,” the delegation provision—an\n\n“additional, antecedent agreement” to arbitrate, Rent-A-Center,         561 U.S. at 70—is\n\n“unenforceable from its inception.”        Thus, Virginia’s decision to treat delegation\n\nprovisions in insurance contracts as void constitutes “grounds as exist at law . . . for the\n\nrevocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n       We also reach this conclusion because Section 38.2–312 reflects a state policy\n\nchoice that insureds should have the option to seek enforcement of Virginia’s insurance\n\nlaws and regulations in court, rather than through arbitration. Enforcing contractual\n\nprovisions that provide arbitrators with exclusive authority to determine whether a\n\ncontract amounts to a “contract of insurance”—a term defined by Virginia law—would\n\nundermine that purpose by giving the arbitrators exclusive authority over a core question\n\nof Virginia insurance law. Indeed, were an arbitrator to incorrectly determine that a\n\ncontract was not an “insurance contract” for purposes of Virginia law and move forward\n\nwith arbitration of the underlying dispute—or to correctly conclude that a contract was an\n\ninsurance contract and then incorrectly move forward with arbitration of the underlying\n\n\n                                             13\n\fdispute—a Virginia insured would be deprived of recourse to the judiciary to resolve a\n\ndispute over the interpretation of an insurance contract governed by Virginia law, the\n\nprecise outcome Virginia sought to prevent in enacting Section 38.2–312.\n\n      Applied Underwriters argues that this conclusion places this Court in conflict with\n\nthe Third and Sixth Circuits, which have held that questions of arbitrability of RPAs\n\nbetween Applied Underwriters and other Equity Comp customers—and governed by\n\ndifferent state laws—were for the arbitrator to resolve. See S. Jersey Sanitation Co. v.\n\nApplied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (3d Cir. 2016);\n\nMilan Express Co. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co., 590 Fed. App’x\n\n482, 486 (6th Cir. 2014). We disagree. Neither South Jersey Sanitation nor Milan\n\nExpress considered—much less decided—whether the relevant state insurance laws\n\nrendered unenforceable the delegation provision in the RPA—the question we resolve\n\nhere. Accordingly, South Jersey Sanitation and Milan Express are inapposite to whether\n\nSection 38.2–312 renders void delegation provisions in putative insurance contracts\n\ngoverned by Virginia law.\n\n      In sum, because Section 38.2–312 renders void delegation provisions in putative\n\ninsurance contracts—at least to the extent such provisions authorize an arbitrator to\n\nresolve whether the contract at issue constitutes an “insurance contract”—we conclude\n\nthat the district court did not reversibly err in denying Applied Underwriters’ motion to\n\ncompel arbitration.\n\n                                           B.\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f        Having concluded that the court, not an arbitrator, should determine whether the\n\nRPA constitutes an insurance contract for purposes of Virginia law, we now must decide\n\nwhether the district court properly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel to preclude\n\nApplied Underwriters from taking the position that the RPA is not an insurance contract.\n\nThis Court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court’s application of the equitable\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel.

Applying this test, we conclude that the district court\n\ncommitted legal error in applying judicial estoppel and, therefore, abused its discretion.\n\nSee League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (4th Cir.\n\n2014) (“A district court abuses its discretion when it misapprehends or misapplies the\n\napplicable law.”).\n\n       With respect the first element, the district court concluded that Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ position that “the RPA is a contract of reinsurance and not a contract of\n\ninsurance” was “inconsistent with those [positions] asserted in other legal proceedings.”\n\nJ.A. 465. But none of the other proceedings in which Applied Underwriters allegedly\n\ntook an inconsistent position involved whether the RPA constituted an “insurance\n\ncontract” for purposes of Virginia law—the question at issue here. Therefore, Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ assertion that the RPA is not an insurance contract for purposes of Virginia\n\nlaw is not inconsistent with its legal position in any of those cases. Additionally, in\n\nseveral cases, Applied Underwriters has argued expressly that the RPA did not constitute\n\nan insurance contract for purposes of the relevant state law. See S. Jersey Sanitation, 840\n\nF.3d at 141 (stating that Applied Underwriters argued that, under Nebraska law, the RPA\n\n“was not a workers’ compensation insurance policy, but rather an investment\n\ninstrument[,] . . . a contract relating [to] or concerning a reinsurance policy” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Milan Express Co. v.

Accordingly, Applied\n\nUnderwriters’ position in this case is entirely consistent with the position it has taken in\n\nseveral other cases.\n\n       The second element—that judicial estoppel may only be applied when the position\n\nsought to be estopped is one of fact rather than law—also is not met in this case. Here,\n\nApplied Underwriters’ position is that the RPA does not constitute an insurance contract\n\nfor purposes of Virginia law. Under Virginia law, the interpretation of a contract—and\n\nan insurance contract, in particular—presents a question of law. See PBM Nutritionals,\n\nLLC v. Lexington Ins.
