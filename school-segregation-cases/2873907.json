The Webster group argues that the district court correctly\ndetermined that its motion to intervene was timely, but that the court\nerred in holding the group already had adequate means to protect its\ninterests without intervention.    We affirm the order of the district court.\n\n\n     The Kansas City school desegregation litigation began in 1977 when\nthe KCMSD, the School Board, and the children of four board\n\n\n\n\n         1\n        The other proposed intervenors are Nia Webster, by her\nparents and next friends Elaine and Ajamu Webster; Alley Pope, by\nher parent and next friend Carol Coe; Kimberly Beasley, by her\nparents and next friends Arthur and Patricia Beasley; Arthur\nBeasley, by his parents and next friends Arthur and Patricia\nBeasley; Felicia Rhodes, by her parents and next friends Charles\nand Elizabeth Rhodes; Christina Gravley, by her parent and next\nfriend Mona Hicks; Shara Kennedy, by her parent and next friend\nErnestine Kennedy; Cassandra Young, by her parent and next friend\nBea Sanders; Ajamu Webster; Elaine Webster; Carol Coe; Patricia\nBeasley; Mona Hicks; Ernestine Kennedy; and Bea Sanders.\n     2\n      The Honorable Russell G.

The district court converted the suit into a class\naction, making a plaintiff class of all present and future students of the\nKCMSD.       We   affirmed    the   district   court's   finding   of   constitutional\nviolations by the KCMSD and the State of Missouri in Jenkins v. Missouri,\n807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (Jenkins I), cert. denied, 484 U.S.\n816 (1987).       We later considered the district court's remedy for these\nconstitutional violations in Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F.2d 1295 (8th Cir.\n1988) (Jenkins II), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990).\nIn all, this court has heard over twenty appeals, including twelve dealing\nwith the remedy,3 four dealing with voluntary interdistrict transfer\nplans,4 and four dealing with attorneys' fees.5              The Supreme Court has\nheard this case three times.

Ct. 2038 (1995); Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990);\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274 (1989).\n\n\n     The Webster group sought to intervene in this litigation on December\n1, 1994.   The Webster group is comprised of African-American children, who\nare or might be in the future students in the KCMSD, and their parents.\nIn its motion to intervene, the Webster group stated that the KCMSD was\nfailing to eliminate the segregated school system in Kansas City and\ncontributing to low achievement and a general attitude of inferiority among\nAfrican-American students.      The Webster group also asserted that the\nplaintiff Jenkins class no longer adequately represented the interests of\nAfrican-American students, even though all African-American students are\nmembers of the Jenkins class.     Consequently, the Webster group wanted to\nintervene to represent the interests of African-American students.\n\n\n     The district court denied the Webster group's motion to intervene.\nThe court concluded that the Webster group timely filed its motion, but\ndenied the motion to intervene as a matter of right because there were\nsufficient avenues open for the group to protect its interests without\nintervention.    Since the children in the Webster group were already members\nof the Jenkins class, the court encouraged the members of the Webster group\nto express their concerns to the attorneys for the Jenkins class.        The\ncourt pointed out that the Webster group could communicate its views to the\nDesegregation Monitoring Committee, which in turn could present them to the\ncourt.   The court encouraged the Webster group to file amicus curiae briefs\nand seek permission to testify on any issue before the court.   Finally, the\ncourt denied the group's motion for permissive intervention.     See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(b).   The Webster group now appeals only the denial of its motion\nto intervene as a matter of right.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                                         I.\n\n\n     The Jenkins class and the State of Missouri oppose the Webster\ngroup's motion to intervene and argue that the district court erred in\ndetermining the motion was timely.\n\n\n     A district court should consider all of the circumstances when\ndetermining the timeliness of a motion to intervene.            NAACP v. New York,\n413 U.S. 345, 365-66 (1973).     In looking at all of the circumstances, the\ncourt should pay particular attention to: (1) how far the proceedings have\nprogressed; (2) the proposed intervenor's reason for delay in seeking\nintervention; and (3) the possible prejudice to the parties already in the\nproceedings if the court allows intervention.         Nevilles v. EEOC, 511 F.2d\n303, 305 (8th Cir. 1975) (per curiam).            We review the district court's\ntimeliness determinations for abuse of discretion.           NAACP v. New York, 413\nU.S. at 366.\n\n\n     The Webster group argues that its motion is timely because its\nmembers only recently became aware of the need to protect the interests of\nAfrican-American students.      The group states that it was not until the\nmiddle of 1994 that it became obvious the Jenkins class was no longer\nprotecting the interests of its African-American members.            In April 1994,\nthe Jenkins class supported the construction of a new magnet school,\ndespite the need to renovate traditional schools.                The Webster group\ncontends that renovation of the traditional schools would better serve\nAfrican-American   students    because    these    schools    are   dilapidated   and\npredominantly populated by minority students.        In the late summer of 1994,\nthe Jenkins class argued against increasing the number of minority students\nin the KCMSD's magnet schools.    The Webster group contends that the magnet\nschools   are the better schools in the KCMSD and increased minority\nenrollment in these schools would benefit African-American students.              The\nWebster group argues that these actions by the Jenkins class show that the\nclass is no longer\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frepresenting the interests of African-American students.          Until these\nactions occurred, the Webster group argues that it had no reason to\nintervene.\n\n\n      The Jenkins class and the State argue that the Webster group's motion\nto intervene is not timely because members of the group were aware of the\nissues raised in their motion to intervene long before they filed their\nmotion.    The Jenkins class points out that Ajamu Webster testified on\nFebruary 22, 1993, about the relationship between magnet schools and\ntraditional schools within the KCMSD.    Webster testified that there was an\nundue emphasis on magnet schools over traditional schools and that magnet\nschools overemphasized the importance of white students to the detriment\nof African-American students.\n\n\n      Webster also described the Coalition for Education and Economic\nJustice, which included two members of the Webster group and one of its\nattorneys.   The Coalition proposed a program to change the funding and\nteaching of the seventeen traditional schools and presented the program to\nthe   Desegregation   Monitoring   Committee.   The   Coalition   had   several\ndiscussions with the KCMSD administration and the Board of Education, and\nits relationship with them has been less than friendly on occasion.\n\n\n      The Jenkins class points out that four members of the Webster group\nhave been members of school advisory committees, and that others have\ntestified before the Desegregation Monitoring Committee and appeared before\nthe KCMSD board.   The State points out that from 1987 to 1990 the district\ncourt established the priorities for the improvement of the traditional\nschools.\n\n\n      Considering all of these factors, it is evident that the adult\nmembers of the Webster group knew of the issues they presented in their\nmotion to intervene well before they filed their motion.          This record\ndemonstrates that the timeliness of the Webster group's\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmotion to intervene is a close and troublesome question.      We dispose of\nthis case on the basis of the district court's reasoning which makes it\nunnecessary for us to decide the timeliness issue.      If any group seeks\nintervention in the future, the district court should carefully consider\nthe timeliness of the intervention efforts.\n\n\n                                    II.\n\n\n     The Webster group argues that it is entitled to intervene as a matter\nof right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).         Under Rule\n24(a)(2), intervention shall be permitted if:   (1) the proposed intervenor\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the\nsubject of the action; (2) the disposition of the action may as a practical\nmatter impair or impede the proposed intervenor's ability to protect that\ninterest; and (3) no existing party adequately represents the proposed\nintervenor's interest.\n\n\n     The district court held that the Webster group was not entitled to\nintervene as a matter of right because the \"intervenors will not be\nimpaired or impeded in their ability to protect\" their interests during the\ndisposition of the case.   The Webster group argues that the district court\napplied an improper legal standard in so ruling, as all that it must\ndemonstrate is that the action \"may as a practical matter\" impair its\ninterests.   Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 738 F.2d 82, 84 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam).   We reject this argument.\n\n\n\n     The district court's discussion of this issue does not demonstrate\nthat the court imposed a heavier burden on the Webster group than the rule\nrequires.    In KPERS v. Reimer & Koger Assocs., 60 F.3d 1304 (8th Cir.\n1995), decided after the briefs were filed in this case, we made clear that\na proposed intervenor does not bear the burden of establishing that its\ninterests will actually be\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fimpaired by the disposition of the case.    Id. at 1307-08.    In KPERS, the\ndistrict court imposed such a burden, saying that the proposed intervenor's\nstare decisis argument did not \"necessitate a finding\" that the intervening\ninterests \"will be practically impaired but for its involvement,\" and that\nit was unlikely that the proposed intervenor \"would be adversely affected\"\nin a later proceeding by rulings in the KPERS case.   Id. at 1306.   We held\nthat such a standard conflicted with the language of Rule 24(a)(2) and\nholdings of this court.    Id. at 1308.\n\n\n     In contrast, the district court in this case clearly stated the\nproper standard, and then found that the \"proposed intervenors will not be\nimpaired or impeded in their ability to protect\" their interest.         This\nfinding rules out the possibility that the Webster group could show that\nits interests may, as a practical matter, be impaired.\n\n\n       This is not a case where the impairment of the interest of the\napplicant is conceded, assumed, or generally accepted.        See Bradley v.\nMilliken, 828 F.2d 1186, 1192 (6th Cir. 1987); Morgan v. McDonough, 726\nF.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v. Board of Sch. Comm'rs, 466\nF.2d 573, 575 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909 (1973).         The\ndistrict court squarely faced those issues and found that there was no\nimpairment of the interests of the Webster group because of the other\navenues available to it.   We are persuaded that the district court did not\nerr in this ruling.\n\n\n     The district court's holding also rests on the alternative ground\nthat the Webster group's interests are adequately represented.       Although\nthe court stated that it need not reach the adequacy of representation, it\ndiscussed the avenues open to the Webster group to express the group's\nposition, either through the Desegregation Monitoring Committee, through\ncounsel for the Jenkins class, by filing amicus curiae briefs, or by\nrequesting permission to testify in hearings.     In this discussion, the\ncourt actually\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdeals with the adequacy of representation.             Furthermore, in its discussion\nof permissive intervention later in the opinion, the court explicitly\nconcluded         that   the   Webster    group's   interests   are   being    adequately\nrepresented.\n\n\n        A    party cannot intervene as of right if another party in the\nlitigation adequately represents its interests.            Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).\nThere       is   a   presumption   of    adequate   representation    when    the   persons\nattempting to intervene are members of a class already involved in the\nlitigation or are intervening only to protect the interests of class\nmembers.         See Bradley, 828 F.2d 1186, 1192; cf. United States v. South Bend\nCommunity Sch. Corp., 692 F.2d 623, 628 (7th Cir. 1982).               See generally 7C\nCharles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1909, at 318-19,\n324-29 (1986).           A difference of opinion concerning litigation strategy or\nindividual aspects of a remedy does not overcome the presumption of\nadequate representation.           See Bradley, 828 F.2d at 1192; Stadin v. Union\nElec. Co., 309 F.2d 912, 919 (8th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 915\n(1963); see also South Bend Community Sch. Corp., 692 F.2d at 628;\nPennsylvania v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501, 505 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S.\n921 (1976); cf. United States v. Perry County Bd. of Educ., 567 F.2d 277,\n280 (5th Cir. 1978).           But see United States v. Oregon, 839 F.2d 635, 638\n(9th Cir. 1988).\n\n\n        There is no dispute that the students in the Webster group are\nmembers of the Jenkins class.              The parents in the Webster group seek to\nintervene only to protect their children's interests.                 Thus, there is a\npresumption that the Jenkins class adequately represents the interests of\nthe Webster group.         See Bradley, 828 F.2d at 1192.       See generally 7C Wright\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1909, at 318-19, 324-29.\n\n\n        The Webster group argues that the KCMSD has failed to implement\nprograms designed to help African-American students who are still suffering\nfrom the harmful effects of past segregation.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fOn numerous occasions in our earlier opinions we discussed the development\nof   the   programs   designed   to   remedy   the   pervasive    effects   of   past\nsegregation, with particular attention to the victims.           See Jenkins II, 855\nF.2d at 1300-02 (citing Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485, 1492 (W.D.\nMo. 1984) and Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 24 (W.D. Mo. 1985),\naff'd as modified by, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc)).                    The\ndistrict court and this Court have discussed in detail over the last ten\nyears the development of the educational programs designed to remedy the\neffects of segregation and the extensive construction and renovation of\nfacilities to serve as both magnet schools and traditional schools.               The\nWebster group's argument that KCMSD has failed to help develop programs\ndesigned to help the victims of unconstitutional segregation is contrary\nto the record in this case.\n\n\n      The rest of the Webster group's argument consists of assertions that\nthe Jenkins class ought to support increased minority enrollment in the\nmagnet schools and have different priorities in the improvement of KCMSD\nschools.   These arguments   are disagreements over the details of the remedy\nand do not show inadequate representation.       See Bradley, 828 F.2d at 1192.\n\n\n      The Webster group cites Liddell v. Caldwell, 546 F.2d 768 (8th Cir.\n1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 914 (1977), in support of its argument that\nthe Jenkins class no longer adequately represents the interests of African-\nAmerican students.    Liddell found of great significance the fact that the\ndistrict court at the time of the intervention in question had \"only\npartially approved specific plans for desegregation.\"             Id. at 771.    This\nsituation is in stark contrast to that in the case before us, where the\ndesegregation program has been developed and partially implemented over the\nlast ten years, substantial efforts and funds expended, and, indeed, where\nthe State is calling for a declaration of unitary status.               The Webster\ngroup does not argue that the Jenkins class has given\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fup the goal of a unitary school system or that the Jenkins class cannot\nreach that goal on the path it has chosen.   The group argues only that its\nmembers would prefer the Jenkins class take a different path to that goal.\nWhile the Jenkins class may not have completely satisfied all of its\nmembers, there is no showing that its conduct has been so deficient as to\nrender its representation inadequate.\n\n\n     We believe that the district court implicitly reached the issue of\nadequacy of representation, and that the district court's order is also\nsustainable on this ground.   Indeed, we have serious doubts as to whether\nthe Webster group presented evidence that would have been sufficient as a\nmatter of law to sustain a finding that the Webster group's interests were\ninadequately represented by existing parties and procedures.\n\n\n     If future developments in the ongoing litigation again present the\nnecessity to rule on intervention issues, there will be time enough for\nfurther development of the record in the district court at that point.\n\n\n     We affirm the district court's denial of the Webster group's motion\nto intervene.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

The Webster group is comprised of African-American children, who\nare or might be in the future students in the KCMSD, and their parents.\nIn its motion to intervene, the Webster group stated that the KCMSD was\nfailing to eliminate the segregated school system in Kansas City and\ncontributing to low achievement and a general attitude of inferiority among\nAfrican-American students.      The Webster group also asserted that the\nplaintiff Jenkins class no longer adequately represented the interests of\nAfrican-American students, even though all African-American students are\nmembers of the Jenkins class.     Consequently, the Webster group wanted to\nintervene to represent the interests of African-American students.\n\n\n     The district court denied the Webster group's motion to intervene.\nThe court concluded that the Webster group timely filed its motion, but\ndenied the motion to intervene as a matter of right because there were\nsufficient avenues open for the group to protect its interests without\nintervention.    Since the children in the Webster group were already members\nof the Jenkins class, the court encouraged the members of the Webster group\nto express their concerns to the attorneys for the Jenkins class.        The\ncourt pointed out that the Webster group could communicate its views to the\nDesegregation Monitoring Committee, which in turn could present them to the\ncourt.   The court encouraged the Webster group to file amicus curiae briefs\nand seek permission to testify on any issue before the court.   Finally, the\ncourt denied the group's motion for permissive intervention.     See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(b).   The Webster group now appeals only the denial of its motion\nto intervene as a matter of right.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                                         I.\n\n\n     The Jenkins class and the State of Missouri oppose the Webster\ngroup's motion to intervene and argue that the district court erred in\ndetermining the motion was timely.\n\n\n     A district court should consider all of the circumstances when\ndetermining the timeliness of a motion to intervene.

New York,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108847\"><a href=\"/opinion/108847/naacp-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365-66 (1973).     In looking at all of the circumstances, the\ncourt should pay particular attention to: (1) how far the proceedings have\nprogressed; (2) the proposed intervenor's reason for delay in seeking\nintervention; and (3) the possible prejudice to the parties already in the\nproceedings if the court allows intervention.

We review the district court's\ntimeliness determinations for abuse of discretion.           NAACP v. New York, 413\nU.S. at 366.\n\n\n     The Webster group argues that its motion is timely because its\nmembers only recently became aware of the need to protect the interests of\nAfrican-American students.      The group states that it was not until the\nmiddle of 1994 that it became obvious the Jenkins class was no longer\nprotecting the interests of its African-American members.            In April 1994,\nthe Jenkins class supported the construction of a new magnet school,\ndespite the need to renovate traditional schools.                The Webster group\ncontends that renovation of the traditional schools would better serve\nAfrican-American   students    because    these    schools    are   dilapidated   and\npredominantly populated by minority students.        In the late summer of 1994,\nthe Jenkins class argued against increasing the number of minority students\nin the KCMSD's magnet schools.    The Webster group contends that the magnet\nschools   are the better schools in the KCMSD and increased minority\nenrollment in these schools would benefit African-American students.              The\nWebster group argues that these actions by the Jenkins class show that the\nclass is no longer\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frepresenting the interests of African-American students.          Until these\nactions occurred, the Webster group argues that it had no reason to\nintervene.\n\n\n      The Jenkins class and the State argue that the Webster group's motion\nto intervene is not timely because members of the group were aware of the\nissues raised in their motion to intervene long before they filed their\nmotion.    The Jenkins class points out that Ajamu Webster testified on\nFebruary 22, 1993, about the relationship between magnet schools and\ntraditional schools within the KCMSD.    Webster testified that there was an\nundue emphasis on magnet schools over traditional schools and that magnet\nschools overemphasized the importance of white students to the detriment\nof African-American students.\n\n\n      Webster also described the Coalition for Education and Economic\nJustice, which included two members of the Webster group and one of its\nattorneys.   The Coalition proposed a program to change the funding and\nteaching of the seventeen traditional schools and presented the program to\nthe   Desegregation   Monitoring   Committee.   The   Coalition   had   several\ndiscussions with the KCMSD administration and the Board of Education, and\nits relationship with them has been less than friendly on occasion.\n\n\n      The Jenkins class points out that four members of the Webster group\nhave been members of school advisory committees, and that others have\ntestified before the Desegregation Monitoring Committee and appeared before\nthe KCMSD board.   The State points out that from 1987 to 1990 the district\ncourt established the priorities for the improvement of the traditional\nschools.\n\n\n      Considering all of these factors, it is evident that the adult\nmembers of the Webster group knew of the issues they presented in their\nmotion to intervene well before they filed their motion.          This record\ndemonstrates that the timeliness of the Webster group's\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmotion to intervene is a close and troublesome question.      We dispose of\nthis case on the basis of the district court's reasoning which makes it\nunnecessary for us to decide the timeliness issue.      If any group seeks\nintervention in the future, the district court should carefully consider\nthe timeliness of the intervention efforts.\n\n\n                                    II.\n\n\n     The Webster group argues that it is entitled to intervene as a matter\nof right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).         Under Rule\n24(a)(2), intervention shall be permitted if:   (1) the proposed intervenor\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the\nsubject of the action; (2) the disposition of the action may as a practical\nmatter impair or impede the proposed intervenor's ability to protect that\ninterest; and (3) no existing party adequately represents the proposed\nintervenor's interest.\n\n\n     The district court held that the Webster group was not entitled to\nintervene as a matter of right because the \"intervenors will not be\nimpaired or impeded in their ability to protect\" their interests during the\ndisposition of the case.   The Webster group argues that the district court\napplied an improper legal standard in so ruling, as all that it must\ndemonstrate is that the action \"may as a practical matter\" impair its\ninterests.   Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No.\n1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437693\"><a href=\"/opinion/437693/little-rock-school-district-v-pulaski-county-special-school-district-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam).   We reject this argument.\n\n\n\n     The district court's discussion of this issue does not demonstrate\nthat the court imposed a heavier burden on the Webster group than the rule\nrequires.    In KPERS v. Reimer & Koger Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1995), decided after the briefs were filed in this case, we made clear that\na proposed intervenor does not bear the burden of establishing that its\ninterests will actually be\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fimpaired by the disposition of the case.    Id. at 1307-08.    In KPERS, the\ndistrict court imposed such a burden, saying that the proposed intervenor's\nstare decisis argument did not \"necessitate a finding\" that the intervening\ninterests \"will be practically impaired but for its involvement,\" and that\nit was unlikely that the proposed intervenor \"would be adversely affected\"\nin a later proceeding by rulings in the KPERS case.   Id. at 1306.   We held\nthat such a standard conflicted with the language of Rule 24(a)(2) and\nholdings of this court.    Id. at 1308.\n\n\n     In contrast, the district court in this case clearly stated the\nproper standard, and then found that the \"proposed intervenors will not be\nimpaired or impeded in their ability to protect\" their interest.         This\nfinding rules out the possibility that the Webster group could show that\nits interests may, as a practical matter, be impaired.\n\n\n       This is not a case where the impairment of the interest of the\napplicant is conceded, assumed, or generally accepted.

The\ndistrict court squarely faced those issues and found that there was no\nimpairment of the interests of the Webster group because of the other\navenues available to it.   We are persuaded that the district court did not\nerr in this ruling.\n\n\n     The district court's holding also rests on the alternative ground\nthat the Webster group's interests are adequately represented.       Although\nthe court stated that it need not reach the adequacy of representation, it\ndiscussed the avenues open to the Webster group to express the group's\nposition, either through the Desegregation Monitoring Committee, through\ncounsel for the Jenkins class, by filing amicus curiae briefs, or by\nrequesting permission to testify in hearings.     In this discussion, the\ncourt actually\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdeals with the adequacy of representation.             Furthermore, in its discussion\nof permissive intervention later in the opinion, the court explicitly\nconcluded         that   the   Webster    group's   interests   are   being    adequately\nrepresented.\n\n\n        A    party cannot intervene as of right if another party in the\nlitigation adequately represents its interests.            Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).\nThere       is   a   presumption   of    adequate   representation    when    the   persons\nattempting to intervene are members of a class already involved in the\nlitigation or are intervening only to protect the interests of class\nmembers.

The parents in the Webster group seek to\nintervene only to protect their children's interests.                 Thus, there is a\npresumption that the Jenkins class adequately represents the interests of\nthe Webster group.         See Bradley, 828 F.2d at 1192.       See generally 7C Wright\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1909, at 318-19, 324-29.\n\n\n        The Webster group argues that the KCMSD has failed to implement\nprograms designed to help African-American students who are still suffering\nfrom the harmful effects of past segregation.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fOn numerous occasions in our earlier opinions we discussed the development\nof   the   programs   designed   to   remedy   the   pervasive    effects   of   past\nsegregation, with particular attention to the victims.

The\ndistrict court and this Court have discussed in detail over the last ten\nyears the development of the educational programs designed to remedy the\neffects of segregation and the extensive construction and renovation of\nfacilities to serve as both magnet schools and traditional schools.               The\nWebster group's argument that KCMSD has failed to help develop programs\ndesigned to help the victims of unconstitutional segregation is contrary\nto the record in this case.\n\n\n      The rest of the Webster group's argument consists of assertions that\nthe Jenkins class ought to support increased minority enrollment in the\nmagnet schools and have different priorities in the improvement of KCMSD\nschools.   These arguments   are disagreements over the details of the remedy\nand do not show inadequate representation.       See Bradley, 828 F.2d at 1192.\n\n\n      The Webster group cites Liddell v. Caldwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1976), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977), in support of its argument that\nthe Jenkins class no longer adequately represents the interests of African-\nAmerican students.    Liddell found of great significance the fact that the\ndistrict court at the time of the intervention in question had \"only\npartially approved specific plans for desegregation.\"             Id. at 771.    This\nsituation is in stark contrast to that in the case before us, where the\ndesegregation program has been developed and partially implemented over the\nlast ten years, substantial efforts and funds expended, and, indeed, where\nthe State is calling for a declaration of unitary status.               The Webster\ngroup does not argue that the Jenkins class has given\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fup the goal of a unitary school system or that the Jenkins class cannot\nreach that goal on the path it has chosen.   The group argues only that its\nmembers would prefer the Jenkins class take a different path to that goal.\nWhile the Jenkins class may not have completely satisfied all of its\nmembers, there is no showing that its conduct has been so deficient as to\nrender its representation inadequate.\n\n\n     We believe that the district court implicitly reached the issue of\nadequacy of representation, and that the district court's order is also\nsustainable on this ground.   Indeed, we have serious doubts as to whether\nthe Webster group presented evidence that would have been sufficient as a\nmatter of law to sustain a finding that the Webster group's interests were\ninadequately represented by existing parties and procedures.\n\n\n     If future developments in the ongoing litigation again present the\nnecessity to rule on intervention issues, there will be time enough for\nfurther development of the record in the district court at that point.\n\n\n     We affirm the district court's denial of the Webster group's motion\nto intervene.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f</pre>",
