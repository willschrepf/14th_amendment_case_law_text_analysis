Before reaching the\ndistrict court, Moscato pursued his administrative remedies, but\nwas barred from proceeding to the final level of administrative\nreview because of his failure to file a timely appeal. This\nappeal requires us to determine what effect such a procedural\ndefault has upon a federal prisoner's request for habeas corpus\nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. We hold that a prisoner's\nprocedural default of his administrative remedies bars judicial\nreview of his habeas petition unless he can show cause for the\ndefault and prejudice attributable thereto. Because Moscato\ncommitted a procedural default of his administrative remedies by\nfiling an untimely appeal and because he cannot show cause for\nthe default, we are barred from review of the merits of his §\n2241 petition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\ndismissal of Moscato's petition, although we do so on different\ngrounds.\n\n                                I.\n         On April 8, 1993, Moscato's unit at the Allenwood\nFederal Prison Camp was subjected to a shakedown. According to\nMoscato, when he returned to his living area, he discovered that\nhis possessions had been trampled and discarded on the floor.\nMoscato grew angry and, although the nature of his behavior\nremains in dispute, all parties agree that officers soon removed\nMoscato to the Lieutenant's office and charged him with Engaging\nin or Encouraging Others in a Group Demonstration. See 28 C.F.R.\n§ 541.13 - Table 3 (Code 212) (1993). That same night, Moscato\nwas removed from the Federal Prison Camp and transported a few\n\fmiles away to administrative segregation at Low Security\nCorrectional Institution (\"LSCI\") Allenwood.\n         On May 4, 1993, Moscato received a disciplinary hearing\nat LSCI Allenwood. Prior to the hearing, he requested that\nCorrectional Officer David Ortiz and three inmates be called as\nwitnesses on his behalf. The disciplinary hearing officer\nrefused to call any of Moscato's witnesses, stating that Ortiz\nwas an adverse witness whose testimony was already before the\nhearing officer as part of the investigative report, and that the\ninmate witnesses, imprisoned at a different site, were\nunavailable for testimony. In lieu of the inmates' oral\ntestimony, the prison solicited from them brief statements that\nsupported Moscato's recollection of the incident. At the\nhearing, Moscato read a statement on his own behalf and denied\nengaging in or encouraging a group demonstration. The hearing\nofficer also reviewed statements from the five correctional\nofficers who were present at the time of the incident. No other\nwitnesses appeared for either side.\n         After reviewing all of the evidence, the hearing\nofficer found Moscato guilty of Attempting to Engage in or\nEncouraging Others in a Group Demonstration, see 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13(b) - Table 3 (Code 212A), rather than the substantive act\nitself. According to the disciplinary hearing report, the\nsanctions imposed included: (a) disciplinary confinement; (b)\nforfeiture of 45 days statutory good time; (c) withholding of 10\ndays statutory good time; and (d) termination of eligibility for\ncamp good time effective April 8, 1993. The hearing officer also\nrecommended that Moscato receive a disciplinary transfer. Prior\nto this incident, Moscato had 269 days of statutory good-time\ncredit.\n         Moscato was informed of his right to appeal. It is not\nclear from the record whether he appealed first to the Warden.\nIt is clear, however, that he filed a timely appeal to the Bureau\nof Prisons, Northeast Regional Director, seeking restoration of\nhis good time credits and expungement of his incident report, and\nthat, on June 29, 1993, the appeal was denied. Moscato attempted\nto appeal this decision to the Bureau's central office, the\nOffice of General Counsel, but his appeal was not received until\nAugust 14, 1993, 16 days after the 30 day deadline. The General\nCounsel denied the appeal as untimely. Moscato submitted a\nsecond appeal to the General Counsel on October 12, 1993; it too\nwas denied as untimely.\n         On April 14, 1994, Moscato filed an in forma pauperispetition\nrequesting habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n2241 on the grounds that the Bureau of Prisons had denied him\ndue process at the disciplinary hearing and that the evidence was\ninsufficient to support the hearing officer's determination of\nmisconduct. Moscato initially requested a rehearing of his\ndisciplinary charge and restoration of his good-time credits.\nThe U.S. Attorney opposed the petition on the merits but also\nargued that Moscato's untimely appeal to the General Counsel\nbarred judicial review of his petition for relief. In reply,\nMoscato asked that the decision of the hearing officer be\nreversed and that the incident report be expunged from his prison\n\frecord.\n         By consent of the parties, the case was submitted to a\nmagistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). The magistrate\njudge dismissed the petition on the merits without discussing\nwhether the claims were barred due to a procedural default. In\nrendering this decision, the magistrate judge noted that Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), permitted the use of written\nstatements in lieu of live testimony where the witnesses are\n\"unavailable.\" The magistrate judge reasoned that because\nMoscato's witnesses were not imprisoned with Moscato at LSCI\nAllenwood, they were unavailable, and thus use of their written\nstatements was not in error. The magistrate judge also held that\ndue process did not require the hearing officer to call Officer\nOrtiz because Ortiz was an adverse witness who had submitted a\nmemorandum describing the incident. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(c).\nFinally, the magistrate judge ruled that the evidence was\nsufficient to sustain a finding that Moscato had attempted to\nencourage a group demonstration.   This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                               II.\n         Federal prisoners are ordinarily required to exhaust\ntheir administrative remedies before petitioning for a writ of\nhabeas corpus pursuant to § 2241.   Bradshaw v. Carlson, 682 F.2d\n1050, 1052 (3d Cir. 1981) (per curiam); United States v. Gabor,\n905 F.2d 76, 78 n.2 (5th Cir. 1990); Sanchez v. Miller, 792 F.2d\n694, 699 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1056 (1987).\nHere, however, we are presented with a situation where, because\nMoscato failed to timely file an appeal to the General Counsel,\nMoscato cannot complete the administrative process. The Bureau\ncontends that, because Moscato's appeal was denied as untimely,\nhe committed a procedural default that barred review of his §\n2241 petition. We believe that Moscato's failure to satisfy the\nprocedural rules of the Bureau's administrative process\nconstitutes a procedural default. Francis v. Rison, 894 F.2d\n353, 355 & n.2 (9th Cir. 1990); Sanchez, 792 F.2d at 697 (citingEngle v.\nIsaac, 456 U.S. 107, 124-25 & n.28 (1982)). We must\ntherefore determine what the effect of such a default should be.\n         The Seventh Circuit, which is the one Court of Appeals\nto have considered this precise issue, has held that if a\nprisoner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies due to\na procedural default and the default renders unavailable the\nadministrative process, review of his habeas claim is barred\nunless he can demonstrate cause and prejudice. Sanchez, 792 F.2d\nat 699. Because we believe that the preexisting law of\nprocedural default and exhaustion of remedies renders the Seventh\nCircuit's decision inexorable, we endorse and adopt this holding.\n         The Supreme Court first articulated the cause and\nprejudice rule of procedural default in Davis v. United States,\n411 U.S. 233 (1973). In Davis, a federal prisoner petitioning\nunder § 2255 sought to challenge for the first time the\ncomposition of the grand jury that indicted him. The petitioner\nhad failed to comply with Fed. R. Crim. P. 12, which required\nthat a failure to object to the composition of a grand jury at\n\ftrial constituted a waiver of the objection absent \"for cause\nshown.\" The Supreme Court determined that review of the habeas\npetition was barred absent a showing of cause for the failure to\ncomply with the procedural requirement and of actual prejudice\nresulting from the alleged constitutional violation. 411 U.S. at\n243-45.\n         The Court later extended the rule of Davis to cases\ninvolving state and federal procedural rules that did not\nexplicitly allow for an exception upon a showing for cause. SeeFrancis v.\nHenderson, 425 U.S. 536, 542 (1976) (cause and effect\nshowing required to waive default of state procedural requirement\nthat a challenge to grand jury composition be raised before\ntrial); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 85, 89 (1977) (federal\nhabeas barred absent showing of cause and prejudice when prisoner\nwaived, under state law, his objection to admission of his\nconfession); United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 167-68 (1982)\n(applying cause and prejudice rule in a federal habeas action\ninvolving Fed. R. Crim. P. 30, which contained no explicit\nexception to requirement for timely challenge to jury\ninstructions); Neely v. Zimmerman, 858 F.2d 144, 145 (3rd Cir.\n1988) (failure to raise Massiah claim in post-verdict motion as\nrequired by state common law bars review of petitioner's habeas\nclaim).\n         As the foregoing discussion indicates, a procedural\ndefault generally bars review of a federal habeas corpus petition\nabsent a showing of cause and prejudice, \"whether the default\noccurs in federal or state court, at trial or on appeal, and\nwhether or not the procedural rule expressly incorporates a\ncause-and-prejudice standard.\" Sanchez, 792 F.2d 698. The courts\nenforce the cause and prejudice rule in part to conserve judicial\nresources by requiring state or federal prisoners who seek habeas\nrelief to present their claims to the venue initially available.\nId.; Engle, 456 U.S. at 126-29 (discussion of costs associated\nwith habeas review). For federal prisoners challenging\ndisciplinary proceedings, the initial venue is the administrative\nprocess. By applying the cause and prejudice rule to habeas\nreview of administrative proceedings, we insure that prisoners do\nnot circumvent the appropriate agencies and needlessly swamp the\ncourts with petitions for relief.\n         We also believe that a procedural default in the\nadministrative process bars judicial review because \"the reasons\nfor requiring that prisoners challenging disciplinary actions\nexhaust their administrative remedies are analogous to the\nreasons for requiring that they exhaust their judicial remedies\nbefore challenging their convictions; thus, the effect of a\nfailure to exhaust in either context should be similar.\"\nSanchez, 792 F.2d at 698. We require exhaustion for three\nreasons: (1) allowing the appropriate agency to develop a factual\nrecord and apply its expertise facilitates judicial review; (2)\npermitting agencies to grant the relief requested conserves\njudicial resources; and (3) providing agencies the opportunity to\ncorrect their own errors fosters administrative autonomy.\nBradshaw, 682 F.2d at 1052; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman,\n420 U.S. 738, 756-57 (1975) (exhaustion avoids duplicative\n\fproceedings and insures that judicial review will be informed and\nnarrowed); McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 195 (1969)\n(circumvention of administrative process diminishes effectiveness\nof an agency by encouraging prisoners to ignore its procedures).\nRequiring petitioners to satisfy the procedural requirements of\nthe administrative remedy process promotes each of these goals.\n         In sum, we hold that a federal prisoner who challenges\na disciplinary proceeding within a federal institution, fails to\nexhaust his administrative remedies because of a procedural\ndefault, and subsequently finds closed all additional avenues of\nadministrative remedy, cannot secure judicial review of his\nhabeas claim absent a showing of cause and prejudice.\n\n                               III.\n         The district court did not rule on whether Moscato\ncould excuse his procedural default. Although we could remand\nfor further proceedings, when we reviewed the supplemental\nbriefing on the issue of cause, we were struck by the lack of\nsuggestion that anything other than Moscato's dilatoriness caused\nthe appeal to be filed late. Where, in the face of an explicit\nopportunity to do so, a petitioner fails to allege the existence\nof an external impediment, a remand for a hearing is unnecessary\nbecause there is no factual dispute to resolve. Cf. Wainwright,\n433 U.S. at 91; Esslinger v. Davis, 44 F.3d 1515, 1528 n.45 (11th\nCir. 1995); Sanchez, 792 F.2d at 699. Because Moscato cannot\nshow cause, we need not address the question of actual prejudice.\nCaswell v. Ryan, 953 F.2d 853, 863 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 504\nU.S. 944 (1992).\n         Accordingly, because Moscato committed a procedural\ndefault of his administrative remedies, and because he cannot\nshow cause for the default, his habeas petition filed pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 2241 is barred from review on the merits. The order\nof the magistrate judge dismissing the petition will therefore be\naffirmed.\n\f",

Before reaching the\ndistrict court, Moscato pursued his administrative remedies, but\nwas barred from proceeding to the final level of administrative\nreview because of his failure to file a timely appeal. This\nappeal requires us to determine what effect such a procedural\ndefault has upon a federal prisoner's request for habeas corpus\nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. We hold that a prisoner's\nprocedural default of his administrative remedies bars judicial\nreview of his habeas petition unless he can show cause for the\ndefault and prejudice attributable thereto. Because Moscato\ncommitted a procedural default of his administrative remedies by\nfiling an untimely appeal and because he cannot show cause for\nthe default, we are barred from review of the merits of his §\n2241 petition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\ndismissal of Moscato's petition, although we do so on different\ngrounds.\n\n                                I.\n         On April 8, 1993, Moscato's unit at the Allenwood\nFederal Prison Camp was subjected to a shakedown. According to\nMoscato, when he returned to his living area, he discovered that\nhis possessions had been trampled and discarded on the floor.\nMoscato grew angry and, although the nature of his behavior\nremains in dispute, all parties agree that officers soon removed\nMoscato to the Lieutenant's office and charged him with Engaging\nin or Encouraging Others in a Group Demonstration. See 28 C.F.R.\n§ 541.13 - Table 3 (Code 212) (1993). That same night, Moscato\nwas removed from the Federal Prison Camp and transported a few\n\fmiles away to administrative segregation at Low Security\nCorrectional Institution (\"LSCI\") Allenwood.\n         On May 4, 1993, Moscato received a disciplinary hearing\nat LSCI Allenwood. Prior to the hearing, he requested that\nCorrectional Officer David Ortiz and three inmates be called as\nwitnesses on his behalf. The disciplinary hearing officer\nrefused to call any of Moscato's witnesses, stating that Ortiz\nwas an adverse witness whose testimony was already before the\nhearing officer as part of the investigative report, and that the\ninmate witnesses, imprisoned at a different site, were\nunavailable for testimony. In lieu of the inmates' oral\ntestimony, the prison solicited from them brief statements that\nsupported Moscato's recollection of the incident. At the\nhearing, Moscato read a statement on his own behalf and denied\nengaging in or encouraging a group demonstration. The hearing\nofficer also reviewed statements from the five correctional\nofficers who were present at the time of the incident. No other\nwitnesses appeared for either side.\n         After reviewing all of the evidence, the hearing\nofficer found Moscato guilty of Attempting to Engage in or\nEncouraging Others in a Group Demonstration, see 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13(b) - Table 3 (Code 212A), rather than the substantive act\nitself. According to the disciplinary hearing report, the\nsanctions imposed included: (a) disciplinary confinement; (b)\nforfeiture of 45 days statutory good time; (c) withholding of 10\ndays statutory good time; and (d) termination of eligibility for\ncamp good time effective April 8, 1993. The hearing officer also\nrecommended that Moscato receive a disciplinary transfer. Prior\nto this incident, Moscato had 269 days of statutory good-time\ncredit.\n         Moscato was informed of his right to appeal. It is not\nclear from the record whether he appealed first to the Warden.\nIt is clear, however, that he filed a timely appeal to the Bureau\nof Prisons, Northeast Regional Director, seeking restoration of\nhis good time credits and expungement of his incident report, and\nthat, on June 29, 1993, the appeal was denied. Moscato attempted\nto appeal this decision to the Bureau's central office, the\nOffice of General Counsel, but his appeal was not received until\nAugust 14, 1993, 16 days after the 30 day deadline. The General\nCounsel denied the appeal as untimely. Moscato submitted a\nsecond appeal to the General Counsel on October 12, 1993; it too\nwas denied as untimely.\n         On April 14, 1994, Moscato filed an in forma pauperispetition\nrequesting habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n2241 on the grounds that the Bureau of Prisons had denied him\ndue process at the disciplinary hearing and that the evidence was\ninsufficient to support the hearing officer's determination of\nmisconduct. Moscato initially requested a rehearing of his\ndisciplinary charge and restoration of his good-time credits.\nThe U.S. Attorney opposed the petition on the merits but also\nargued that Moscato's untimely appeal to the General Counsel\nbarred judicial review of his petition for relief. In reply,\nMoscato asked that the decision of the hearing officer be\nreversed and that the incident report be expunged from his prison\n\frecord.\n         By consent of the parties, the case was submitted to a\nmagistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). The magistrate\njudge dismissed the petition on the merits without discussing\nwhether the claims were barred due to a procedural default. In\nrendering this decision, the magistrate judge noted that Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), permitted the use of written\nstatements in lieu of live testimony where the witnesses are\n\"unavailable.\" The magistrate judge reasoned that because\nMoscato's witnesses were not imprisoned with Moscato at LSCI\nAllenwood, they were unavailable, and thus use of their written\nstatements was not in error. The magistrate judge also held that\ndue process did not require the hearing officer to call Officer\nOrtiz because Ortiz was an adverse witness who had submitted a\nmemorandum describing the incident. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(c).\nFinally, the magistrate judge ruled that the evidence was\nsufficient to sustain a finding that Moscato had attempted to\nencourage a group demonstration.   This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                               II.\n         Federal prisoners are ordinarily required to exhaust\ntheir administrative remedies before petitioning for a writ of\nhabeas corpus pursuant to § 2241.

The Bureau\ncontends that, because Moscato's appeal was denied as untimely,\nhe committed a procedural default that barred review of his §\n2241 petition. We believe that Moscato's failure to satisfy the\nprocedural rules of the Bureau's administrative process\nconstitutes a procedural default. Francis v. Rison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535323\"><a href=\"/opinion/535323/rondal-r-francis-v-rh-rison-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 & n.2 (9th Cir. 1990); Sanchez, 792 F.2d at 697 (citingEngle v.\nIsaac, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110692\"><a href=\"/opinion/110692/engle-v-isaac/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124-25 & n.28 (1982)). We must\ntherefore determine what the effect of such a default should be.\n         The Seventh Circuit, which is the one Court of Appeals\nto have considered this precise issue, has held that if a\nprisoner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies due to\na procedural default and the default renders unavailable the\nadministrative process, review of his habeas claim is barred\nunless he can demonstrate cause and prejudice. Sanchez, 792 F.2d\nat 699. Because we believe that the preexisting law of\nprocedural default and exhaustion of remedies renders the Seventh\nCircuit's decision inexorable, we endorse and adopt this holding.\n         The Supreme Court first articulated the cause and\nprejudice rule of procedural default in Davis v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108761\"><a href=\"/opinion/108761/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). In Davis, a federal prisoner petitioning\nunder § 2255 sought to challenge for the first time the\ncomposition of the grand jury that indicted him. The petitioner\nhad failed to comply with Fed. R. Crim. P. 12, which required\nthat a failure to object to the composition of a grand jury at\n\ftrial constituted a waiver of the objection absent \"for cause\nshown.\" The Supreme Court determined that review of the habeas\npetition was barred absent a showing of cause for the failure to\ncomply with the procedural requirement and of actual prejudice\nresulting from the alleged constitutional violation. 411 U.S. at\n243-45.\n         The Court later extended the rule of Davis to cases\ninvolving state and federal procedural rules that did not\nexplicitly allow for an exception upon a showing for cause.

The courts\nenforce the cause and prejudice rule in part to conserve judicial\nresources by requiring state or federal prisoners who seek habeas\nrelief to present their claims to the venue initially available.\nId.; Engle, 456 U.S. at 126-29 (discussion of costs associated\nwith habeas review). For federal prisoners challenging\ndisciplinary proceedings, the initial venue is the administrative\nprocess. By applying the cause and prejudice rule to habeas\nreview of administrative proceedings, we insure that prisoners do\nnot circumvent the appropriate agencies and needlessly swamp the\ncourts with petitions for relief.\n         We also believe that a procedural default in the\nadministrative process bars judicial review because \"the reasons\nfor requiring that prisoners challenging disciplinary actions\nexhaust their administrative remedies are analogous to the\nreasons for requiring that they exhaust their judicial remedies\nbefore challenging their convictions; thus, the effect of a\nfailure to exhaust in either context should be similar.\"\nSanchez, 792 F.2d at 698. We require exhaustion for three\nreasons: (1) allowing the appropriate agency to develop a factual\nrecord and apply its expertise facilitates judicial review; (2)\npermitting agencies to grant the relief requested conserves\njudicial resources; and (3) providing agencies the opportunity to\ncorrect their own errors fosters administrative autonomy.\nBradshaw, 682 F.2d at 1052; see also Schlesinger v.

Although we could remand\nfor further proceedings, when we reviewed the supplemental\nbriefing on the issue of cause, we were struck by the lack of\nsuggestion that anything other than Moscato's dilatoriness caused\nthe appeal to be filed late. Where, in the face of an explicit\nopportunity to do so, a petitioner fails to allege the existence\nof an external impediment, a remand for a hearing is unnecessary\nbecause there is no factual dispute to resolve.
