Waterhouse, Lenoir City, Tennessee, for the Appellee, Miracle Kaa Nichols.\n\f                                            OPINION\n\n                                           Background\n\n\n                Husband and Wife were married in 1986. Two minor children were born of the\nmarriage. As the only issues raised in this appeal concern the division of property, we confine our\ndiscussion to those facts relevant to those issues.\n\n                The parties lived in Atlanta during the first eight or ten months of their marriage.\nThey moved to the Farm in 1987 or 1988, at the request of Husband’s father to help take care of\nHusband’s father who was ill. The Farm consists of approximately 41 acres of land that Husband\ntestified has belonged to his family for approximately 85 years. Prior to his death, Husband’s father\ndeeded the Farm to Husband. Wife testified that she has lived on the Farm for 18 or 19 years and\nthat she considers it her home. She stated: “That is our home. The kids were conceived there, and\n[Husband] brought me there and told me it would be my home, and I want to stay.” Wife admitted\nthat she could make do with half of the Farm. Husband admitted that the Farm is Wife’s and the\nchildren’s home.\n\n                Prior to February of 1996, the Farm property included a house, a barn, a shed, and a\nsawmill. Wife testified that the parties also put up some fencing and that Husband built a big garage\non the Farm. The parties lived in the house on the Farm until February of 1996, when the house was\ndestroyed in a fire. Wife testified that the parties were going to rebuild the house, but never made\nmuch progress in doing so. She testified that they did have some concrete poured and laid a block\nbasement for the new house. On February 26, 1996, after the fire, Husband deeded the Farm to\nhimself and Wife. He stated that he did so at Wife’s request and that he and Wife were separated\nat the time. Wife admitted that she asked Husband to put her name on the deed after the fire. She\ntestified that Husband left after the fire and the parties were separated for a few months before\nHusband moved back home. Husband testified that no improvements were made to the Farm after\nhe deeded the property to himself and Wife.\n\n                Husband collected $40,000 in insurance money as a result of the fire. He used\n$16,000 of this money to purchase a mobile home that is titled solely in Wife’s name. Wife and the\nparties’ children currently reside in this mobile home on the Farm. Husband testified that he used\nthe remaining money to pay marital bills and to buy a dishwasher, and a washer and dryer for the\nmobile home. Wife testified that Husband also purchased a new bed for her. Wife further testified\nthat Husband bought a computer for the family for Christmas just before he left, and that he\npurchased a 1996 Jeep Cherokee for Wife for their tenth anniversary. Wife also testified that the\nparties purchased farm equipment, tools, tractors, a bulldozer, a dump truck, and a skid steer loader\nover the years. Wife testified that since Husband left, she has maintained the tractor and the small\nbobcat and has “had to mow and keep things clean and stuff ….”\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                 Husband testified that the parties signed a prenuptial agreement drafted by Husband’s\nfather. Husband stated: “It was an agreement that it stated that if the farm was ever in contention that\n[Wife] wouldn’t have a part of it.” Wife admits she signed some document Husband’s father drafted\n“because he was afraid I was marrying [Husband] to take all the property, I guess.” Husband\ntestified that to his knowledge there was a copy of the prenuptial agreement in the parties’ safety\ndeposit box and one in the house. Neither copy was located after the fire. Wife admitted that she\nvisited the safety deposit box in February of 1996, shortly before the fire, and again in March of\n1996, shortly after the fire.\n\n               Wife testified that when Husband started EMT school, “he lost all interest in us,\nperiod.” Wife testified that Husband spent a lot of time on his computer meeting women who would\nlater call Husband. Wife also testified that she found a “really sexy and fun …” Valentine’s Day\ncard purchased by Husband and that Husband later told her he gave this card to a woman at the bank.\n\n                Wife, who was 42 years old at the time of trial, testified that she is in excellent health.\nShe completed high school and worked in the pharmacy at K-mart for approximately eight years\nbefore the parties married. After the parties’ first child was born, Wife quit work to stay at home and\ndid so for approximately 14 years. Wife keeps a number on animals on the Farm including dogs,\ncats, chickens, goats, pot belly pigs, turkeys, horses, cows, a sheep, and a burro. Wife currently is\nemployed full-time at the Loudon County Animal Shelter as an animal control officer.\n\n                 Wife testified that she owns a piece of real property comprised of two unimproved\ncity lots, which she and her mother purchased in 1979 or 1980, before Wife married Husband. Wife\nalso testified that she owns a Ford Ranger truck that she purchased with money she inherited from\nher mother, and a 1979 Lincoln Town car that she inherited from her mother.\n\n               Husband, who was 43 years old at the time of trial, is employed as a firefighter by\nLenoir City Fire Department. Husband testified that he left Wife because “the house was in fairly\ndisarray” and because Wife’s sister and Wife “circumvented” his ability to parent his children and\n“alienated me from my parental process.” Wife admitted that she is not a “great housekeeper.”\n\n                Husband left Wife in April of 2002, and admitted that from April until December of\nthat year, he did not pay child support, pay any marital debt, check on his farm equipment, call his\nchildren, send Christmas or birthday presents, or provide Wife and his children any food or clothing.\nHusband stated: “I didn’t just walk out. I informed them of why I walked out.”\n\n                Husband admitted that he purchased a brand new motorcycle for $8,800\napproximately one month after he left Wife. Husband testified that he used the motorcycle to take\nvacations and to travel to different states. Husband testified that he wrecked his motorcycle while\non vacation in South Dakota in August of 2003. Husband received insurance money for it and made\n$1,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -3-\n\f               Husband admitted that he met a woman from Texas on-line and that he has made trips\nto Texas to see her and has purchased gifts for her. In addition, Husband testified he currently is\nliving with another woman. Husband admitted that in August of 2002, he purchased a half-carat\ndiamond ring for $699. He stated: “It was for [Wife], but it’s not now.” Husband further testified\nthat in September of 2002, after he left Wife, he purchased a stereo system for $540, and in October\nof 2002, he purchased an X-box video game platform for himself for $467.48.\n\n                After trial, the Trial Court entered a Final Decree on September 27, 2004 granting,\ninter alia, Wife a divorce from Husband on the grounds of inappropriate marital conduct, and finding\nand holding that the Farm is marital property and that it\n\n       shall be equally divided between the parties such that each party shall receive one-\n       half the value of the land and mobile home. The parties shall share equally the cost\n       of a survey to set the boundary line and a fence to run the boundary line between the\n       parties’ respective sides of the property. The [Wife] shall receive the side of the\n       property where the mobile home and other structures are located. The [Husband’s]\n       side shall include more road frontage than [Wife’s] side so as to offset for the value\n       of the mobile home awarded to [Wife.]\n\nThe Final Decree also, among other things, divided items of personal property and awarded each\nparty “one-half of the pension, 401(k) an[d] any other retirement plan or benefits of the other party\nas of the date of the divorce.” Husband appeals to this Court. Wife also appeals the marital property\ndivision.\n\n                                             Discussion\n\n                Husband raises two issues on appeal: 1) whether the Trial Court erred in classifying\nthe Farm as marital property; and, 2) in the alternative, whether the Trial Court erred by failing to\ndivide the marital estate equitably. Wife also raises an issue regarding whether the Trial Court erred\nby failing to equitably divide the personal property portion of the marital estate.\n\n                Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of correctness\nof the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise. Tenn.\nR. App. P. 13(d); Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 727 (Tenn. 2001). A trial court's conclusions of\nlaw are subject to a de novo review with no presumption of correctness. S. Constructors, Inc. v.\nLoudon County Bd. of Educ., 58 S.W.3d 706, 710 (Tenn. 2001).\n\n                We first will consider whether the Trial Court erred in classifying the Farm as marital\nproperty. As relevant to this appeal, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) provides the following\ndefinitions of marital and separate property:\n\n               (1)(A) \"Marital property\" means all real and personal property, both\n               tangible and intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fcourse of the marriage up to the date of the final divorce hearing and\nowned by either or both spouses as of the date of filing of a complaint\nfor divorce, except in the case of fraudulent conveyance in\nanticipation of filing, and including any property to which a right was\nacquired up to the date of the final divorce hearing, and valued as of\na date as near as reasonably possible to the final divorce hearing\ndate.… All marital property shall be valued as of a date as near as\npossible to the date of entry of the order finally dividing the marital\nproperty.\n\n(B) \"Marital property\" includes income from, and any increase in\nvalue during the marriage of, property determined to be separate\nproperty in accordance with subdivision (b)(2) if each party\nsubstantially contributed to its preservation and appreciation, and the\nvalue of vested and unvested pension, vested and unvested stock\noption rights, retirement or other fringe benefit rights relating to\nemployment that accrued during the period of the marriage.\n\n                                 ***\n\n(D) As used in this subsection, \"substantial contribution\" may\ninclude, but not be limited to, the direct or indirect contribution of a\nspouse as homemaker, wage earner, parent or family financial\nmanager, together with such other factors as the court having\njurisdiction thereof may determine.\n\n                                 ***\n\n(2) \"Separate property\" means:\n\n(A) All real and personal property owned by a spouse before\nmarriage, including, but not limited to, assets held in individual\nretirement accounts (IRAs) as that term is defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n\n(B) Property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the\nmarriage;\n\n(C) Income from and appreciation of property owned by a spouse\nbefore marriage except when characterized as marital property under\nsubdivision (b)(1);\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f               (D) Property acquired by a spouse at any time by gift, bequest, devise\n               or descent ….\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) (2001).\n\n               Our Supreme Court had occasion to discuss the concepts of marital property and\nseparate property in Langschmidt v. Langschmidt, 81 S.W.3d 741 (Tenn. 2002). In Langschmidt,\nthe Supreme Court noted that in addition to the statutory provisions contained in Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(b), Tennessee intermediate appellate courts have recognized two methods by which\nseparate property may be converted into marital property. Id. at 747. These two methods are\ncommingling and transmutation, which the Supreme Court noted have been described by this Court\nas follows:\n\n               [S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling] if\n               inextricably mingled with marital property or with the separate\n               property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be\n               segregated or can be traced into its product, commingling does not\n               occur.... [Transmutation] occurs when separate property is treated in\n               such a way as to give evidence of an intention that it become marital\n               property.... The rationale underlying these doctrines is that dealing\n               with property in these ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift\n               to the marital estate. This presumption is based also upon the\n               provision in many marital property statutes that property acquired\n               during the marriage is presumed to be marital. The presumption can\n               be rebutted by evidence of circumstances or communications clearly\n               indicating an intent that the property remain separate.\n\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (citations omitted).\n\n                Husband argues, in part, that “[t]here is simply insufficient proof in the record, in\nlight of the clear intention as evidenced by the prenuptial agreement, that [he] intended to make a\ngift [of the Farm to the marital estate.]” We disagree. First, no prenuptial agreement ever was\nproduced and although neither party disputes that Wife signed some document drafted by Husband’s\nfather regarding the Farm some years earlier, this document apparently no longer exists. Second,\nyears after Wife signed the purported prenuptial agreement, Husband specifically deeded the Farm\nto himself and Wife. Husband certainly was free to change his mind during the intervening years\nbetween when the purported prenuptial agreement was signed and when Husband deeded the Farm\nto himself and to Wife, and apparently he did so. Husband was free to make a gift to the marital\nestate, whether a prenuptial agreement existed or not. Third, Husband admits that the Farm is Wife’s\nhome.\n\n             The evidence supports the Trial Court’s finding that the Farm was transmuted from\nHusband’s separate property into marital property, thus raising a rebuttable presumption that\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fHusband made a gift of the Farm to the marital estate. The record is devoid of evidence showing\nany circumstances or communications that occurred at the time Husband made the gift to the marital\nestate or subsequent thereto, which clearly indicate Husband’s intent that the Farm remain his\nseparate property. As Husband made the gift well after the purported prenuptial agreement was\nsigned, the prenuptial agreement cannot serve as evidence of Husband’s intent at the time of the\ntransfer to keep the Farm as his separate property. Husband failed to rebut the presumption of a gift\nto Wife, and, therefore to the marital estate. The evidence does not preponderate against the Trial\nCourt’s finding that the Farm is marital property, and we, therefore, affirm the Trial Court’s finding\nthat the Farm is marital property.\n\n             We next will consider whether the Trial Court failed to divide the marital estate\nequitably. When determining how to distribute property in a divorce, courts must look to Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121. In pertinent part, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) provides:\n\n       (c) In making equitable division of marital property, the court shall consider all\n       relevant factors including:\n\n               (1) The duration of the marriage;\n\n               (2) The age, physical and mental health, vocational skills, employability,\n               earning capacity, estate, financial liabilities and financial needs of each of the\n               parties;\n\n               (3) The tangible or intangible contribution by one (1) party to the education,\n               training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n               (4) The relative ability of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets\n               and income;\n\n               (5) The contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation,\n               appreciation, depreciation or dissipation of the marital or separate property,\n               including the contribution of a party to the marriage as homemaker, wage\n               earner or parent, with the contribution of a party as homemaker or wage\n               earner to be given the same weight if each party has fulfilled its role;\n\n               (6) The value of the separate property of each party;\n\n               (7) The estate of each party at the time of the marriage;\n\n               (8) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of\n               property is to become effective;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f                (9) The tax consequences to each party, costs associated with the reasonably\n                foreseeable sale of the asset, and other reasonably foreseeable expenses\n                associated with the asset;\n\n                (10) The amount of social security benefits available to each spouse; and\n\n                (11) Such other factors as are necessary to consider the equities between the\n                parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) (2001).\n\n               A trial court has wide discretion in dividing the interest of the parties in marital\nproperty. Barnhill v. Barnhill, 826 S.W.2d 443, 449 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991). As noted by this Court\nin King v. King, when dividing marital property:\n\n                The trial court’s goal in every divorce case is to divide the parties’\n                marital estate in a just and equitable manner. The division of the\n                estate is not rendered inequitable simply because it is not\n                mathematically equal, Cohen v. Cohen, 937 S.W.2d 823, 832 (Tenn.\n                1996); Ellis v. Ellis, 748 S.W.2d 424, 427 (Tenn. 1988), or because\n                each party did not receive a share of every item of marital property.\n                Brown v. Brown, 913 S.W.2d [163] at 168. . . . In the final analysis,\n                the justness of a particular division of the marital property and\n                allocation of marital debt depends on its final results. See Thompson\n                v. Thompson, 797 S.W.2d 599, 604 (Tenn. App. 1990).\n\nKing v. King, 986 S.W.2d 216, 219 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Roseberry v. Roseberry, No.\n03A01-9706-CH-00237, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100, at *11-12 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 1998), no\nappl. perm. appeal filed).\n\n                In addition to Husband’s issue concerning the division of the marital estate, Wife\nargues that the Trial Court erred in its division of the marital personal property. Wife, however,\nignores the fact that the goal is to render an equitable division of the entire marital estate and not an\nequitable division of each and every item or type of marital property.\n\n                Some of the factors contained in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) weigh equally for\nHusband and Wife, while others tend to favor Wife and yet others tend to favor Husband. Our\nreview of the entire record in this case convinces this Court that the Trial Court properly considered\nall relevant factors when distributing the marital estate.

Two minor children were born of the\nmarriage. As the only issues raised in this appeal concern the division of property, we confine our\ndiscussion to those facts relevant to those issues.\n\n                The parties lived in Atlanta during the first eight or ten months of their marriage.\nThey moved to the Farm in 1987 or 1988, at the request of Husband’s father to help take care of\nHusband’s father who was ill. The Farm consists of approximately 41 acres of land that Husband\ntestified has belonged to his family for approximately 85 years. Prior to his death, Husband’s father\ndeeded the Farm to Husband. Wife testified that she has lived on the Farm for 18 or 19 years and\nthat she considers it her home. She stated: “That is our home. The kids were conceived there, and\n[Husband] brought me there and told me it would be my home, and I want to stay.” Wife admitted\nthat she could make do with half of the Farm. Husband admitted that the Farm is Wife’s and the\nchildren’s home.\n\n                Prior to February of 1996, the Farm property included a house, a barn, a shed, and a\nsawmill. Wife testified that the parties also put up some fencing and that Husband built a big garage\non the Farm. The parties lived in the house on the Farm until February of 1996, when the house was\ndestroyed in a fire. Wife testified that the parties were going to rebuild the house, but never made\nmuch progress in doing so. She testified that they did have some concrete poured and laid a block\nbasement for the new house. On February 26, 1996, after the fire, Husband deeded the Farm to\nhimself and Wife. He stated that he did so at Wife’s request and that he and Wife were separated\nat the time. Wife admitted that she asked Husband to put her name on the deed after the fire. She\ntestified that Husband left after the fire and the parties were separated for a few months before\nHusband moved back home. Husband testified that no improvements were made to the Farm after\nhe deeded the property to himself and Wife.\n\n                Husband collected $40,000 in insurance money as a result of the fire. He used\n$16,000 of this money to purchase a mobile home that is titled solely in Wife’s name. Wife and the\nparties’ children currently reside in this mobile home on the Farm. Husband testified that he used\nthe remaining money to pay marital bills and to buy a dishwasher, and a washer and dryer for the\nmobile home. Wife testified that Husband also purchased a new bed for her. Wife further testified\nthat Husband bought a computer for the family for Christmas just before he left, and that he\npurchased a 1996 Jeep Cherokee for Wife for their tenth anniversary. Wife also testified that the\nparties purchased farm equipment, tools, tractors, a bulldozer, a dump truck, and a skid steer loader\nover the years. Wife testified that since Husband left, she has maintained the tractor and the small\nbobcat and has “had to mow and keep things clean and stuff ….”\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                 Husband testified that the parties signed a prenuptial agreement drafted by Husband’s\nfather. Husband stated: “It was an agreement that it stated that if the farm was ever in contention that\n[Wife] wouldn’t have a part of it.” Wife admits she signed some document Husband’s father drafted\n“because he was afraid I was marrying [Husband] to take all the property, I guess.” Husband\ntestified that to his knowledge there was a copy of the prenuptial agreement in the parties’ safety\ndeposit box and one in the house. Neither copy was located after the fire. Wife admitted that she\nvisited the safety deposit box in February of 1996, shortly before the fire, and again in March of\n1996, shortly after the fire.\n\n               Wife testified that when Husband started EMT school, “he lost all interest in us,\nperiod.” Wife testified that Husband spent a lot of time on his computer meeting women who would\nlater call Husband. Wife also testified that she found a “really sexy and fun …” Valentine’s Day\ncard purchased by Husband and that Husband later told her he gave this card to a woman at the bank.\n\n                Wife, who was 42 years old at the time of trial, testified that she is in excellent health.\nShe completed high school and worked in the pharmacy at K-mart for approximately eight years\nbefore the parties married. After the parties’ first child was born, Wife quit work to stay at home and\ndid so for approximately 14 years. Wife keeps a number on animals on the Farm including dogs,\ncats, chickens, goats, pot belly pigs, turkeys, horses, cows, a sheep, and a burro. Wife currently is\nemployed full-time at the Loudon County Animal Shelter as an animal control officer.\n\n                 Wife testified that she owns a piece of real property comprised of two unimproved\ncity lots, which she and her mother purchased in 1979 or 1980, before Wife married Husband. Wife\nalso testified that she owns a Ford Ranger truck that she purchased with money she inherited from\nher mother, and a 1979 Lincoln Town car that she inherited from her mother.\n\n               Husband, who was 43 years old at the time of trial, is employed as a firefighter by\nLenoir City Fire Department. Husband testified that he left Wife because “the house was in fairly\ndisarray” and because Wife’s sister and Wife “circumvented” his ability to parent his children and\n“alienated me from my parental process.” Wife admitted that she is not a “great housekeeper.”\n\n                Husband left Wife in April of 2002, and admitted that from April until December of\nthat year, he did not pay child support, pay any marital debt, check on his farm equipment, call his\nchildren, send Christmas or birthday presents, or provide Wife and his children any food or clothing.\nHusband stated: “I didn’t just walk out. I informed them of why I walked out.”\n\n                Husband admitted that he purchased a brand new motorcycle for $8,800\napproximately one month after he left Wife. Husband testified that he used the motorcycle to take\nvacations and to travel to different states. Husband testified that he wrecked his motorcycle while\non vacation in South Dakota in August of 2003. Husband received insurance money for it and made\n$1,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -3-\n\f               Husband admitted that he met a woman from Texas on-line and that he has made trips\nto Texas to see her and has purchased gifts for her. In addition, Husband testified he currently is\nliving with another woman. Husband admitted that in August of 2002, he purchased a half-carat\ndiamond ring for $699. He stated: “It was for [Wife], but it’s not now.” Husband further testified\nthat in September of 2002, after he left Wife, he purchased a stereo system for $540, and in October\nof 2002, he purchased an X-box video game platform for himself for $467.48.\n\n                After trial, the Trial Court entered a Final Decree on September 27, 2004 granting,\ninter alia, Wife a divorce from Husband on the grounds of inappropriate marital conduct, and finding\nand holding that the Farm is marital property and that it\n\n       shall be equally divided between the parties such that each party shall receive one-\n       half the value of the land and mobile home. The parties shall share equally the cost\n       of a survey to set the boundary line and a fence to run the boundary line between the\n       parties’ respective sides of the property. The [Wife] shall receive the side of the\n       property where the mobile home and other structures are located. The [Husband’s]\n       side shall include more road frontage than [Wife’s] side so as to offset for the value\n       of the mobile home awarded to [Wife.]\n\nThe Final Decree also, among other things, divided items of personal property and awarded each\nparty “one-half of the pension, 401(k) an[d] any other retirement plan or benefits of the other party\nas of the date of the divorce.” Husband appeals to this Court. Wife also appeals the marital property\ndivision.\n\n                                             Discussion\n\n                Husband raises two issues on appeal: 1) whether the Trial Court erred in classifying\nthe Farm as marital property; and, 2) in the alternative, whether the Trial Court erred by failing to\ndivide the marital estate equitably. Wife also raises an issue regarding whether the Trial Court erred\nby failing to equitably divide the personal property portion of the marital estate.\n\n                Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of correctness\nof the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.

As relevant to this appeal, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) provides the following\ndefinitions of marital and separate property:\n\n               (1)(A) \"Marital property\" means all real and personal property, both\n               tangible and intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fcourse of the marriage up to the date of the final divorce hearing and\nowned by either or both spouses as of the date of filing of a complaint\nfor divorce, except in the case of fraudulent conveyance in\nanticipation of filing, and including any property to which a right was\nacquired up to the date of the final divorce hearing, and valued as of\na date as near as reasonably possible to the final divorce hearing\ndate.… All marital property shall be valued as of a date as near as\npossible to the date of entry of the order finally dividing the marital\nproperty.\n\n(B) \"Marital property\" includes income from, and any increase in\nvalue during the marriage of, property determined to be separate\nproperty in accordance with subdivision (b)(2) if each party\nsubstantially contributed to its preservation and appreciation, and the\nvalue of vested and unvested pension, vested and unvested stock\noption rights, retirement or other fringe benefit rights relating to\nemployment that accrued during the period of the marriage.\n\n                                 ***\n\n(D) As used in this subsection, \"substantial contribution\" may\ninclude, but not be limited to, the direct or indirect contribution of a\nspouse as homemaker, wage earner, parent or family financial\nmanager, together with such other factors as the court having\njurisdiction thereof may determine.\n\n                                 ***\n\n(2) \"Separate property\" means:\n\n(A) All real and personal property owned by a spouse before\nmarriage, including, but not limited to, assets held in individual\nretirement accounts (IRAs) as that term is defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n\n(B) Property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the\nmarriage;\n\n(C) Income from and appreciation of property owned by a spouse\nbefore marriage except when characterized as marital property under\nsubdivision (b)(1);\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f               (D) Property acquired by a spouse at any time by gift, bequest, devise\n               or descent ….\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) (2001).\n\n               Our Supreme Court had occasion to discuss the concepts of marital property and\nseparate property in Langschmidt v. Langschmidt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377348/langschmidt-v-langschmidt/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 2002). In Langschmidt,\nthe Supreme Court noted that in addition to the statutory provisions contained in Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-121(b), Tennessee intermediate appellate courts have recognized two methods by which\nseparate property may be converted into marital property. Id. at 747. These two methods are\ncommingling and transmutation, which the Supreme Court noted have been described by this Court\nas follows:\n\n               [S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling] if\n               inextricably mingled with marital property or with the separate\n               property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be\n               segregated or can be traced into its product, commingling does not\n               occur.... [Transmutation] occurs when separate property is treated in\n               such a way as to give evidence of an intention that it become marital\n               property.... The rationale underlying these doctrines is that dealing\n               with property in these ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift\n               to the marital estate. This presumption is based also upon the\n               provision in many marital property statutes that property acquired\n               during the marriage is presumed to be marital. The presumption can\n               be rebutted by evidence of circumstances or communications clearly\n               indicating an intent that the property remain separate.\n\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (citations omitted).\n\n                Husband argues, in part, that “[t]here is simply insufficient proof in the record, in\nlight of the clear intention as evidenced by the prenuptial agreement, that [he] intended to make a\ngift [of the Farm to the marital estate.]” We disagree. First, no prenuptial agreement ever was\nproduced and although neither party disputes that Wife signed some document drafted by Husband’s\nfather regarding the Farm some years earlier, this document apparently no longer exists. Second,\nyears after Wife signed the purported prenuptial agreement, Husband specifically deeded the Farm\nto himself and Wife. Husband certainly was free to change his mind during the intervening years\nbetween when the purported prenuptial agreement was signed and when Husband deeded the Farm\nto himself and to Wife, and apparently he did so. Husband was free to make a gift to the marital\nestate, whether a prenuptial agreement existed or not. Third, Husband admits that the Farm is Wife’s\nhome.\n\n             The evidence supports the Trial Court’s finding that the Farm was transmuted from\nHusband’s separate property into marital property, thus raising a rebuttable presumption that\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fHusband made a gift of the Farm to the marital estate. The record is devoid of evidence showing\nany circumstances or communications that occurred at the time Husband made the gift to the marital\nestate or subsequent thereto, which clearly indicate Husband’s intent that the Farm remain his\nseparate property. As Husband made the gift well after the purported prenuptial agreement was\nsigned, the prenuptial agreement cannot serve as evidence of Husband’s intent at the time of the\ntransfer to keep the Farm as his separate property. Husband failed to rebut the presumption of a gift\nto Wife, and, therefore to the marital estate. The evidence does not preponderate against the Trial\nCourt’s finding that the Farm is marital property, and we, therefore, affirm the Trial Court’s finding\nthat the Farm is marital property.\n\n             We next will consider whether the Trial Court failed to divide the marital estate\nequitably. When determining how to distribute property in a divorce, courts must look to Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121. In pertinent part, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) provides:\n\n       (c) In making equitable division of marital property, the court shall consider all\n       relevant factors including:\n\n               (1) The duration of the marriage;\n\n               (2) The age, physical and mental health, vocational skills, employability,\n               earning capacity, estate, financial liabilities and financial needs of each of the\n               parties;\n\n               (3) The tangible or intangible contribution by one (1) party to the education,\n               training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n               (4) The relative ability of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets\n               and income;\n\n               (5) The contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation,\n               appreciation, depreciation or dissipation of the marital or separate property,\n               including the contribution of a party to the marriage as homemaker, wage\n               earner or parent, with the contribution of a party as homemaker or wage\n               earner to be given the same weight if each party has fulfilled its role;\n\n               (6) The value of the separate property of each party;\n\n               (7) The estate of each party at the time of the marriage;\n\n               (8) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of\n               property is to become effective;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f                (9) The tax consequences to each party, costs associated with the reasonably\n                foreseeable sale of the asset, and other reasonably foreseeable expenses\n                associated with the asset;\n\n                (10) The amount of social security benefits available to each spouse; and\n\n                (11) Such other factors as are necessary to consider the equities between the\n                parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) (2001).\n\n               A trial court has wide discretion in dividing the interest of the parties in marital\nproperty. Barnhill v.

The division of the\n                estate is not rendered inequitable simply because it is not\n                mathematically equal, Cohen v.

In the final analysis,\n                the justness of a particular division of the marital property and\n                allocation of marital debt depends on its final results.

Wife, however,\nignores the fact that the goal is to render an equitable division of the entire marital estate and not an\nequitable division of each and every item or type of marital property.\n\n                Some of the factors contained in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c) weigh equally for\nHusband and Wife, while others tend to favor Wife and yet others tend to favor Husband. Our\nreview of the entire record in this case convinces this Court that the Trial Court properly considered\nall relevant factors when distributing the marital estate. We hold the Trial Court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when distributing the marital estate. The Trial Court’s overall distribution of the entire\nmarital estate is equitable, and, therefore, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f                                           Conclusion\n\n               The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial\nCourt for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed equally against the\nAppellant, James Virgil Nichols, Jr., and his surety, and the Appellee, Miracle Kaa Nichols.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      ___________________________________\n                                                      D.
