Although more than a year had passed since the\n\nSupreme Court issued Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.\n\nCt. 686 (1954), invalidating Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138\n\n(1896), and its separate-but-equal doctrine, change was slow to arrive in Alabama.\n\n      Rosa Parks had had enough. After a long day of work, she boarded the bus\n\nin downtown Montgomery and took a seat. 1 Once the bus filled up, some white\n\nmen boarded and could find no seats. Id. at 83. So the bus driver demanded that\n\nParks and some other African-Americans give their seats to the white men. Id.\n\n      Though the other passengers yielded, Parks refused. Id. In later years, she\n\nexplained, “[W]hen that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his\n\nhand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination to cover my\n\nbody like a quilt on a winter night.” Donnie Williams & Wayne Greenhaw, THE\n\nTHUNDER   OF   ANGELS: THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT             AND THE     PEOPLE WHO\n\nBROKE THE BACK OF JIM CROW 48 (Chicago Rev. Press 2005). Upon seeing Parks\n\ncontinuing to sit, the bus driver persisted, asking Parks if she was going to stand.\n\nJuan Williams, EYES ON THE PRIZE: AMERICA’S CIVIL RIGHTS YEARS, 1954-1965\n\n66 (Penguin Books 1987).\n\n\n      1\n      Interview by Sidney Rogers with Rosa Parks (Apr. 1956), in DAYBREAK OF FREEDOM:\nTHE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT 82 (Stewart Burns ed., 1997).\n                                           2\n\f               Case: 15-10880      Date Filed: 01/04/2016     Page: 3 of 15\n\n\n       Parks said, “No, I’m not.” Id. And when the bus driver threatened to call\n\nthe police, Parks calmly answered, “You may do that.” Id. The police arrived and\n\narrested Parks for refusing to relinquish her bus seat to a white passenger in\n\naccordance with Montgomery city law. Id. at 87.\n\n       Parks’s courageous act inspired the Montgomery Bus Boycott and served as\n\nthe impetus for the modern Civil Rights Movement, transforming the nation. 2 Id.\n\nIn response to Parks’s arrest, for 381 days, 42,000 African-Americans boycotted\n\nMontgomery buses, until the United States Supreme Court held the Montgomery\n\nsegregation law unconstitutional and ordered desegregation of the buses. Act of\n\nMay 4, 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-26, § 1 (4), (5), 113 Stat. 50, 50 (awarding Parks the\n\nCongressional gold medal).\n\n       Parks’s refusal to cede ground in the face of continued injustice has made\n\nher among the most revered heroines of our national story; her role in American\n\nhistory cannot be over-emphasized.           Indeed, the United States Congress has\n\nrecognized Parks as the “first lady of civil rights” and the “mother of the freedom\n\nmovement,” and it has credited Parks with “ignit[ing] the most significant social\n\nmovement in the history of the United States.” Id. at § 1(2).\n\n\n\n       2\n        So significant to the Civil Rights Movement were Parks’s actions of December 1, 1955,\nthat even the actual bus on which Parks made her famous stand, Bus No. 2875, has been\npreserved as a museum exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum. See Rosa Parks Bus, THE HENRY\nFORD MUSEUM http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/rosaparks/faq.asp (last visited Dec. 22,\n2015).\n                                               3\n\f                Case: 15-10880        Date Filed: 01/04/2016         Page: 4 of 15\n\n\n       So it is not surprising that authors would write about Parks’s story and artists\n\nwould celebrate it with their works. The commemoration and dissemination of\n\nParks’s journey continues to entrench and embolden our pursuit of justice. And it\n\nis in the general public interest to relentlessly preserve, spotlight, and recount the\n\nstory of Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights Movement—even when that interest\n\nallegedly conflicts with an individual right of publicity.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development (the\n\n“Institute”) is a Michigan 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation 3 that owns the name\n\nand likeness of the late Rosa Parks 4 pursuant to a right-of-publicity assignment.\n\nTarget Corporation (“Target”), a national retail corporation headquartered in\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, operates more than 1,800 retail stores across the United\n\nStates.\n\n\n\n       3\n         A 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation refers to a corporation “organized and operated\nexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational\npurpose, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition.” 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)\n(2014).\n       4\n          Parks passed away in 2005.

The only other plaque referred to in the record was sold under the same merchandise\nidentification label, “Created Equal,” but it did not depict Parks. Instead, it contained pictures of\nDr. King and other images related to the Civil Rights Movement. The plaques were packaged\nand sold simultaneously.\n                                                  6\n\f              Case: 15-10880    Date Filed: 01/04/2016    Page: 7 of 15\n\n\ndidn’t give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn’t true. I was not tired\n\nphysically. . . [.] I was not old . . . [.] I was forty two. No, the only tired I was,\n\nwas tired of giving in.”\n\n      Stephanie Workman Marrott, the professional artist who designed the\n\nplaque, explained that she created it to “tell[] a story about civil rights in America\n\n. . . [to] describe important aspects of American history and convey a message\n\nabout those events.” She added that her decision to “include[] the name and image\n\nof Rosa Parks, as well as an image of the Montgomery bus and the word\n\n‘CHANGE,’ was in order to tell the story of Rosa Parks and the civil rights\n\nmovement in a way that would convey an inspirational message about standing up\n\nfor what you believe is right and what you believe in.”\n\n      Six of the books, the movie, and the plaque became available for sale on\n\nTarget’s website or in some of its retail stores before November 2011. In 2013, the\n\nTheoharis book was added to Target’s online retail. There is no evidence in the\n\nrecord that any of the products say “Target” on them or are otherwise identifiably\n\naffiliated with Target in any way other than that Target offered them for sale.\n\n      On November 6, 2013, the Institute filed the underlying complaint in the\n\nMiddle District of Alabama. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, the Institute alleged\n\nclaims for unjust enrichment, right of publicity, and misappropriation under\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f               Case: 15-10880      Date Filed: 01/04/2016      Page: 8 of 15\n\n\nMichigan common law for Target’s sales of all items using the name and likeness\n\nof Rosa Parks.\n\n       Generally, the Institute complained that, by selling the products identified\n\nabove, Target had unfairly and “without [the Institute’s] prior knowledge, or\n\nconsent, used [Parks’s] name, likeness, and image to sell products and did promote\n\nand sell products using [Parks’s] name, likeness, and image for [Target’s] own\n\ncommercial advantage.” After Target sought summary judgment, the district court\n\ndismissed the complaint, and this appeal followed. We now affirm the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of the Institute’s complaint.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       The “starting point . . . in all cases in which subject-matter jurisdiction is\n\npremised on diversity of citizenship[] is Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.\n\n64, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938).” Ellis v. Great Sw. Corp., 646 F.2d 1099, 1102-03 (5th\n\nCir. Unit A June 1981).11 Because no federal common law exists, under Erie, a\n\nfederal court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the state in which it\n\nsits except in cases governed by federal law or the United States Constitution. Id.\n\nHere, Alabama’s choice-of-law rules control and hold that the procedural law of\n\nthe forum state is applied, while the law of the state in which the injury occurred\n\n\n\n       11\n          The decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit prior to\nOctober 1, 1981, are binding as precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. Bonner v. City of Prichard,\nAla., 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\n                                                8\n\f                Case: 15-10880       Date Filed: 01/04/2016       Page: 9 of 15\n\n\ngoverns the substantive rights of the case. Fitts v. Minn. Min. & Mfg. Co., 581 So.\n\n2d 819, 820 (Ala. 1991). Accordingly, in this case we apply the procedural rules\n\nof Alabama and the substantive law of Michigan. 12\n\n       In consulting Michigan’s laws, we first consider rulings of Michigan’s\n\nSupreme Court. See Bailey v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., 613 F.2d 1385, 1388 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 449 U.S. 836 (1980). Where the highest court in the state has\n\nrendered no decisions on point, however, we must follow the opinions of\n\nMichigan’s intermediate courts, unless we are “convinced that the highest court\n\nwould decide otherwise.” Id. (citing Comm’r v. Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 465 (1967)).\n\n       In Michigan, the common-law right of privacy protects against four types of\n\ninvasions of privacy:\n\n               1. Intrusion upon the plaintiff’s seclusion or solitude, or\n                  into his private affairs.\n               2. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about\n                  the plaintiff.\n               3. Publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in\n                  the public eye.\n               4. Appropriation for the defendant’s advantage, of the\n                  plaintiff’s name or likeness.\n\n       12\n          It appears that Alabama’s statute of limitations would preclude a claim based on all but\none of the books at issue. Ala. Code § 6-2-38(l) (1975). Alabama typically considers statutes of\nlimitations procedural, Randolph v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 792 F. Supp. 1221, 1222 (N.D. Ala.\n1992), and generally applies what is known as the single-publication rule to tort claims. See\nPrecision Gear Co. v. Cont’l Motors, Inc., 135 So. 3d 953, 957 (Ala. 2013); Cofer v. Ensor, 473\nSo. 2d 984, 987 (Ala. 1985). Although Alabama courts have not yet addressed whether they\nwould apply the single-publication rule to common-law right-of-publicity claims, we are inclined\nto believe that they would. See, e.g., Poff v. Hayes, 763 So. 2d 234, 242 (Ala. 2000). But\nbecause Michigan’s well-established qualified privilege for matters of public concern soundly\nresolves this case, we do not address this specific issue.\n                                                  9\n\f             Case: 15-10880     Date Filed: 01/04/2016    Page: 10 of 15\n\n\nTobin v. Mich. Civ. Serv. Comm’n, 331 N.W.2d 184, 189 (Mich. 1982) (quoting\n\nBeaumont v. Brown, 257 N.W.2d 522, 533 (Mich. 1977), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Bradley v. Saranac Cmty. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 565 N.W.2d 285, 302\n\n(Mich. 1997)). The last category of invasion of privacy—misappropriation of a\n\nperson’s name or likeness—is commonly referred to as a violation of the “right of\n\npublicity.” Ruffin-Steinback v. dePasse, 82 F. Supp. 2d 723, 728-29 (E.D. Mich.\n\n2000) (applying Michigan law), aff’d, 267 F.3d 457 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\n      Michigan’s common-law right of publicity “is founded upon ‘the interest of\n\nthe individual in the exclusive use of his own identity, in so far as it is represented\n\nby his name or likeness, and in so far as the use may be of benefit to him or to\n\nothers.’” Battaglieri v. Mackinac Ctr. for Pub. Pol’y, 680 N.W.2d 915, 919 (Mich.\n\nCt.

Earp v. City of Detroit, 167\n\nN.W.2d 841, 845 (Mich. Ct. App. 1969). The Michigan Constitution guarantees\n\nthat “[e]very person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all\n\nsubjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted\n\n                                          10\n\f               Case: 15-10880        Date Filed: 01/04/2016        Page: 11 of 15\n\n\nto restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.” MICH. CONST. of 1963,\n\nart. I, § 5.13 Premised on this state constitutional right, Michigan courts have long\n\nrecognized that individual rights must yield to the qualified privilege to\n\ncommunicate on matters of public interest. 14 Lawrence v. Fox, 97 N.W.2d 719,\n\n721 (Mich. 1959); Dienes v. Associated Newspapers, Inc., 358 N.W.2d 562, 565\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. 1984).\n\n       The “qualified privilege to report on matters in the public interest is deeply\n\nrooted in Michigan jurisprudence,” Rouch v. Enquirer & News of Battle Creek, 398\n\nN.W.2d 245, 253 (Mich. 1986), and, where the facts are undisputed, presents a\n\nquestion of law. Tumbarella v. Kroger Co., 271 N.W.2d 284, 289 (Mich. Ct. App.\n\n1978). The privilege attaches to matters of general public interest, Peisner v.\n\nDetroit Free Press, Inc., 266 N.W.2d 693, 697 (Mich. Ct. App. 1978), and\n\n“extends to all communications made bona fide upon any subject-matter” where\n\n\n       13\n          The protection derived from this provision of the Michigan Constitution provides the\nnecessary shield for the works at issue and we need not address whether the First Amendment\nwould also serve to protect the works. See United States v. Charles, 722 F.3d 1319, 1332-35\n(11th Cir. 2013) (Marcus, J., specially concurring) (relying on the “long-standing prudential\npolicy ‘that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is\nunavoidable”) (quoting Spector Motor Serv., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S. Ct.\n152, 154 (1994)). We nonetheless recognize and appreciate the efforts of amici in briefing the\nFirst Amendment issues.\n       14\n          In Michigan, matters concerning freedom of speech may be shielded by an absolute or\na qualified privilege. Raymond v. Croll, 206 N.W. 556, 557-58 (Mich. 1925). The absolute\nprivilege is a narrow exception not applicable in the instant case, covering matters such as\njudicial proceedings, Sanders v. Leeson Air Conditioning Corp., 362 Mich. 692, 695, 108\nN.W.2d 761, 762 (Mich. 1961), proceedings of legislative bodies, and communications by\nmilitary and naval officers. Froling v. Carpenter, 203 Mich. App. 368, 371, 512 N.W.2d 6, 8\n(Mich. Ct. App. 1993).\n                                              11\n\f               Case: 15-10880       Date Filed: 01/04/2016      Page: 12 of 15\n\n\nthe party communicating has an interest or a duty to a person having a\n\ncorresponding interest or duty. Bacon v. Mich. Cent. R. Co., 33 N.W. 181, 183\n\n(Mich. 1887). This defense also “embraces cases where the duty is not a legal one,\n\nbut where it is of a moral or social character of imperfect obligation.” Id.15\n\n       The privilege afforded is not a constant but varies with the situation and the\n\nimportance of the social issues at stake. Peisner, 266 N.W.2d at 697. In cases\n\nconcerning social issues, Michigan courts and courts applying Michigan law have\n\nfound the qualified privilege to extend to issues concerning even general topics of\n\npublic concern. See, e.g., Gaynes v. Allen, 339 N.W.2d 678, 681 (Mich. Ct. App.\n\n1983) (public interest in matters of healthcare); Peisner, 266 N.W.2d at 698 (public\n\ninterest in the administration of justice); Weeren v. Evening News Ass’n, 138\n\nN.W.2d 526, 527 (Mich. Ct. App. 1965) (public interest in the broadcast of an\n\nhistorical documentary), rev’d on other grounds, 152 N.W.2d 676 (Mich. 1967);\n\nBichler, 745 F.2d at 1011 (public interest in the closing of the only dinner theater\n\n\n       15\n           Although most often used as a shield to liability in defamation and libel cases,\nMichigan’s absolute and qualified privileges have been applied to preclude liability for claims\npremised on other torts. See, e.g., Meyer v. Hubbell, 324 N.W.2d 139, 144 (Mich. Ct. App.\n1982) (applying absolute privilege to preclude claim of intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress and tortious interference with economic relations); Bichler v. Union Bank & Trust Co. of\nGrand Rapids, 745 F.2d 1006, 1011 (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc) (applying Michigan law and the\nqualified privilege to preclude right-of-privacy claim). The Restatement of the Law also\nrecognizes that the same qualified privilege applicable to defamation and libel claims would\napply with equal force to invasion-of-privacy claims. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §\n652G cmt. a (1977). (“Under any circumstances that would give rise to a conditional privilege\nfor the publication of defamation there is likewise a conditional privilege for the invasion of\nprivacy.”); Beaumont v. Brown, 336 N.W.2d 26, 27 (Mich. Ct. App. 1983) (citing RESTATEMENT\n(SECOND) OF TORTS § 652G).\n                                               12\n\f             Case: 15-10880     Date Filed: 01/04/2016    Page: 13 of 15\n\n\nin Western Michigan); Schultz v. Newsweek, Inc., 481 F. Supp. 881, 884 (E.D.\n\nMich. 1979) (public interest in liquor-license application as a matter of public\n\nfunction).\n\n      Of course, it is beyond dispute that Rosa Parks is a figure of great historical\n\nsignificance and the Civil Rights Movement a matter of legitimate and important\n\npublic interest. And it is uncontested that five of the six books, including an\n\nautobiographical book co-authored by Parks herself, and the movie are all bona\n\nfide works of non-fiction discussing Parks and her role in the Civil Rights\n\nMovement. As for the sixth book, Rosa Parks: Childhood of Famous Americans,\n\nby Kathleen Kudlinski, it is a fictionalized biography meant to introduce children\n\nto the importance of Parks, so it, too, concerns a matter of public interest.\n\n      Similarly, the plaque depicts images and mentions dates and statements\n\nrelated to Parks and the Civil Rights Movement, in an effort to convey a message\n\nconcerning Parks, her courage, and the results of her strength. Indeed, all of the\n\nworks in question “communicate[] information, express[] opinion[s], recite[]\n\ngrievances, [and] protest[] claimed abuses, . . . on behalf of a movement whose\n\nexistence and objectives” continue to be “of the highest public interest and\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f               Case: 15-10880       Date Filed: 01/04/2016       Page: 14 of 15\n\n\nconcern.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 266, 84 S. Ct. 710, 718,\n\n11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964) (discussing the Civil Rights Movement).16\n\n       Although the qualified privilege is not invincible, Lins v. Evening News\n\nAss’n, 342 N.W.2d 573, 581 (Mich. Ct. App. 1983), the Institute has not articulated\n\nany argument as to why Michigan’s qualified privilege for matters of public\n\nconcern would not apply to these works, in light of the conspicuous historical\n\nimportance of Rosa Parks. Nor can we conceive of any.\n\n       The use of Rosa Parks’s name and likeness in the books, movie, and plaque\n\nis necessary to chronicling and discussing the history of the Civil Rights\n\nMovement—matters quintessentially embraced and protected by Michigan’s\n\nqualified privilege. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a discussion of the Civil\n\nRights Movement without reference to Parks and her role in it. And Michigan law\n\ndoes not make discussion of these topics of public concern contingent on paying a\n\nfee. As a result, all six books, the movie, and the plaque find protection in\n\nMichigan’s qualified privilege protecting matters of public interest. 17\n\n\n       16\n          Michigan courts have been clear that “[t]he rights to free speech under the Michigan\nand federal constitutions are coterminous . . . [and t]hus, federal authority construing the First\nAmendment may be used in construing the Michigan Constitution’s free speech guarantee.”\nBurns v. City of Detroit, 660 N.W.2d 85, 93 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002).\n       17\n           The district court held that the Institute’s claims of misappropriation and unjust\nenrichment were derivative of its right-of-publicity claim. The Institute’s misappropriation claim\nis the same as its claim based on the right of publicity and is thus duplicative. See Carson v.\nHere’s Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc., 698 F.3d 831, 834 (6th Cir. 1983) (applying Michigan state\nlaw) (stating that misappropriation of likeness “has become known as ‘the right of publicity’”).\nBecause we find that Target did not unlawfully use Parks’s name and likeness, any acquired\n                                                14\n\f              Case: 15-10880      Date Filed: 01/04/2016     Page: 15 of 15\n\n\n                                            V.\n\n       In short, the district court did not err in dismissing the Institute’s complaint.\n\nThe district court’s order is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\nbenefit would not have been unjust, so the Institute’s common-law claim of unjust enrichment\nnecessarily fails. Tkachik v. Mandeville, 790 N.W.2d 260, 266 (2010).\n                                                15\n\f",

After a long day of work, she boarded the bus\n\nin downtown Montgomery and took a seat. 1 Once the bus filled up, some white\n\nmen boarded and could find no seats. Id. at 83. So the bus driver demanded that\n\nParks and some other African-Americans give their seats to the white men. Id.\n\n      Though the other passengers yielded, Parks refused. Id. In later years, she\n\nexplained, “[W]hen that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his\n\nhand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination to cover my\n\nbody like a quilt on a winter night.” Donnie Williams & Wayne Greenhaw, THE\n\nTHUNDER   OF   ANGELS: THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT             AND THE     PEOPLE WHO\n\nBROKE THE BACK OF JIM CROW 48 (Chicago Rev.

Upon seeing Parks\n\ncontinuing to sit, the bus driver persisted, asking Parks if she was going to stand.\n\nJuan Williams, EYES ON THE PRIZE: AMERICA’S CIVIL RIGHTS YEARS, 1954-1965\n\n66 (Penguin Books 1987).\n\n\n      1\n      Interview by Sidney Rogers with Rosa Parks (Apr. 1956), in DAYBREAK OF FREEDOM:\nTHE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT 82 (Stewart Burns ed., 1997).\n                                           2\n\f               Case: 15-10880      Date Filed: 01/04/2016     Page: 3 of 15\n\n\n       Parks said, “No, I’m not.” Id. And when the bus driver threatened to call\n\nthe police, Parks calmly answered, “You may do that.” Id. The police arrived and\n\narrested Parks for refusing to relinquish her bus seat to a white passenger in\n\naccordance with Montgomery city law. Id. at 87.\n\n       Parks’s courageous act inspired the Montgomery Bus Boycott and served as\n\nthe impetus for the modern Civil Rights Movement, transforming the nation. 2 Id.\n\nIn response to Parks’s arrest, for 381 days, 42,000 African-Americans boycotted\n\nMontgomery buses, until the United States Supreme Court held the Montgomery\n\nsegregation law unconstitutional and ordered desegregation of the buses.

No. 106-26, § 1 (4), (5), 113 Stat. 50, 50 (awarding Parks the\n\nCongressional gold medal).\n\n       Parks’s refusal to cede ground in the face of continued injustice has made\n\nher among the most revered heroines of our national story; her role in American\n\nhistory cannot be over-emphasized.           Indeed, the United States Congress has\n\nrecognized Parks as the “first lady of civil rights” and the “mother of the freedom\n\nmovement,” and it has credited Parks with “ignit[ing] the most significant social\n\nmovement in the history of the United States.” Id. at § 1(2).\n\n\n\n       2\n        So significant to the Civil Rights Movement were Parks’s actions of December 1, 1955,\nthat even the actual bus on which Parks made her famous stand, Bus No. 2875, has been\npreserved as a museum exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum. See Rosa Parks Bus, THE HENRY\nFORD MUSEUM http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/rosaparks/faq.asp (last visited Dec. 22,\n2015).\n                                               3\n\f                Case: 15-10880        Date Filed: 01/04/2016         Page: 4 of 15\n\n\n       So it is not surprising that authors would write about Parks’s story and artists\n\nwould celebrate it with their works. The commemoration and dissemination of\n\nParks’s journey continues to entrench and embolden our pursuit of justice. And it\n\nis in the general public interest to relentlessly preserve, spotlight, and recount the\n\nstory of Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights Movement—even when that interest\n\nallegedly conflicts with an individual right of publicity.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development (the\n\n“Institute”) is a Michigan 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation 3 that owns the name\n\nand likeness of the late Rosa Parks 4 pursuant to a right-of-publicity assignment.\n\nTarget Corporation (“Target”), a national retail corporation headquartered in\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, operates more than 1,800 retail stores across the United\n\nStates.\n\n\n\n       3\n         A 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation refers to a corporation “organized and operated\nexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational\npurpose, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition.” 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)\n(2014).\n       4\n          Parks passed away in 2005.

And it is uncontested that five of the six books, including an\n\nautobiographical book co-authored by Parks herself, and the movie are all bona\n\nfide works of non-fiction discussing Parks and her role in the Civil Rights\n\nMovement. As for the sixth book, Rosa Parks: Childhood of Famous Americans,\n\nby Kathleen Kudlinski, it is a fictionalized biography meant to introduce children\n\nto the importance of Parks, so it, too, concerns a matter of public interest.\n\n      Similarly, the plaque depicts images and mentions dates and statements\n\nrelated to Parks and the Civil Rights Movement, in an effort to convey a message\n\nconcerning Parks, her courage, and the results of her strength. Indeed, all of the\n\nworks in question “communicate[] information, express[] opinion[s], recite[]\n\ngrievances, [and] protest[] claimed abuses, . . . on behalf of a movement whose\n\nexistence and objectives” continue to be “of the highest public interest and\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f               Case: 15-10880       Date Filed: 01/04/2016       Page: 14 of 15\n\n\nconcern.” New York Times Co. v.

Ct. App. 1983), the Institute has not articulated\n\nany argument as to why Michigan’s qualified privilege for matters of public\n\nconcern would not apply to these works, in light of the conspicuous historical\n\nimportance of Rosa Parks. Nor can we conceive of any.\n\n       The use of Rosa Parks’s name and likeness in the books, movie, and plaque\n\nis necessary to chronicling and discussing the history of the Civil Rights\n\nMovement—matters quintessentially embraced and protected by Michigan’s\n\nqualified privilege. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a discussion of the Civil\n\nRights Movement without reference to Parks and her role in it. And Michigan law\n\ndoes not make discussion of these topics of public concern contingent on paying a\n\nfee. As a result, all six books, the movie, and the plaque find protection in\n\nMichigan’s qualified privilege protecting matters of public interest. 17\n\n\n       16\n          Michigan courts have been clear that “[t]he rights to free speech under the Michigan\nand federal constitutions are coterminous . . . [and t]hus, federal authority construing the First\nAmendment may be used in construing the Michigan Constitution’s free speech guarantee.”\nBurns v.

The Institute’s misappropriation claim\nis the same as its claim based on the right of publicity and is thus duplicative.
