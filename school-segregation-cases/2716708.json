Laws 418, 459-60.  Because the 1993 amendments to article 2.21 (A) and (B) did not\r\nsubstantively change the article for purposes of this case, the end result remains the same under\r\neither version of the statute.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBryan King and James S. Bumpous (\"King/Bumpous\") brought an action for breach\r\nof contract against Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. (\"CRB\") and against CRB's president,\r\nTolbert Foster, individually.  On the jury's verdict, the trial court rendered judgment against\r\nCRB, and ordered that King/Bumpous take nothing by their claims against Foster.  King/Bumpous\r\nappeal the take-nothing judgment in favor of Foster.  CRB appeals the judgment against it.  We\r\nwill affirm the judgment against CRB, reverse the take-nothing judgment against Foster, and\r\nremand that portion of the cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>THE CONTROVERSY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn June 1986, Tolbert Foster and his son-in-law, Robert Walker, incorporated\r\nColorado River Broadcasters, Inc. for the purpose of building and subsequently upgrading a radio\r\nstation in Bastrop.<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong>  Foster provided the financing.  Walker supplied the Federal Communications\r\nCommission (\"FCC\") construction permit that he had previously obtained in his own name, and\r\nmanaged the building and upgrading of the station.  Although Walker and Foster intended to\r\ntransfer the construction permit to CRB at some point, they decided to leave it temporarily in\r\nWalker's name.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker contracted with broadcasting consultants King and Bumpous for consulting\r\nservices in connection with the development of the Bastrop station.<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong>  The consulting agreement\r\n(the \"Agreement\") provided that in return for consulting and other services, King/Bumpous would\r\nreceive 5.5 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop station.  King/Bumpous were\r\nunaware of CRB's existence or of its role as the developer of the Bastrop station.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong>  On its face,\r\nthe Agreement purported to be between King/Bumpous and Walker, and did not mention either\r\nFoster or CRB.  Walker signed the Agreement simply, \"Robert W. Walker.\"  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous performed services through December 1986 on behalf of the Bastrop\r\nstation and in accordance with the Agreement.  At that time, CRB and Walker contracted to sell\r\nthe Bastrop station to Beasley Broadcasting, although Walker was still the record owner.  On\r\nJanuary 6, 1987, the completed station requested a new broadcast station license, still reporting\r\nWalker as the station's owner.  On January 20, 1987, Walker transferred the permit to CRB.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn March 30, 1987, CRB and Beasley Broadcasting executed an agreement for sale\r\nof the Bastrop station under which CRB would receive $1 million for the Class A station, and\r\nwould receive an additional $3 million plus $1.25 million in non-competition agreements if the\r\nFCC approved an upgrade to a Class C/2 station.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker informed King/Bumpous of the terms of the sale.  He advised them that he\r\nhad used the initial $1 million payment to cover costs, and there would be no net proceeds for\r\ndistribution until the upgrade was approved.  Due to a long delay, the FCC did not approve the\r\nupgrade until early 1989, at which time Beasley Broadcasting made the second payment to CRB.<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong> \r\nCRB distributed all of the proceeds to Walker and Foster.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 1989, when King/Bumpous were unable to get in touch with Walker, they\r\ncontacted Foster and learned that Walker and Foster had received the proceeds from the sale. \r\nFoster told them he knew nothing about the Agreement.<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong>  CRB no longer actively engages in\r\nbusiness and its only remaining asset is a 32-acre tract of land in Burnet County.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong>  CRB is unable\r\nto pay King/Bumpous the amount owed under the Agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous sued CRB to recover under the Agreement on alternate theories: \r\n(1) CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal in the Agreement; or (2) CRB ratified the\r\nAgreement.  The jury found CRB liable on both theories and fixed damages in the amount of\r\n$147,573.69, representing 5.5 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop station. \r\nAdditionally, King/Bumpous sought to recover contract damages against Foster<strong><sup> (8)</sup></strong></span><span> under alternative\r\ntheories:  (1) Foster had used CRB as his alter ego; or (2) Foster had \"denuded\" CRB by\r\ndistributing substantially all of its assets, thus rendering it incapable of paying its debts.  The jury\r\nfailed to find Foster liable under either theory.  These appeals ensued.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL THEORY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Parol Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first point of error,<strong><sup> (9)</sup></strong></span><span> CRB asserts the trial court erred in submitting the case\r\nto the jury on the theory that CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal.<strong><sup> (10)</sup></strong>  CRB contends that the\r\nAgreement unambiguously indicates that Walker, not CRB, contracted with King/Bumpous, and\r\ntherefore, parol evidence was inadmissible to vary its terms.<strong><sup> (11)</sup></strong>  CRB concludes that the trial court\r\nshould have construed the Agreement as a matter of law with respect to the identity of the\r\ncontracting parties, rather than submitting the issue to the jury.  King/Bumpous respond that parol\r\nevidence was admissible to prove CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal, and that Walker was\r\nacting as CRB's agent.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen an agent acts within the scope of his authority and contracts in his own name\r\non behalf of an undisclosed principal, the contract is enforceable against the principal.  <em>First Nat'l\r\nBank v. Fite</em>, 115 S.W.2d 1105, 1109-10 (Tex. 1938); <em>Sanger v. Warren</em>, 44 S.W. 477, 478 (Tex.\r\n1898).<strong><sup> (12)</sup></strong></span><span>  Parol evidence is admissible to reveal the identity of the principal and hold him liable\r\non a contract made for his benefit.  <em>Heffron v. Pollard</em>, 11 S.W. 165, 166 (Tex. 1889); <em>Nelson\r\nv. Texas Power &amp; Light Co.</em>, 543 S.W.2d 26, 27 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1976, no writ).  Such\r\nextrinsic evidence does not vary the terms of the contract, but brings in a new party whom the law\r\nbinds because of his relationship to the agent.  <em>Heffron</em>, 11 S.W. at 166.  Thus, the fact that the\r\ncontract does not reveal the agency of the signing party or the principal's name is not conclusive\r\nevidence that the principal was not a party to the contract.  <em>Jordan v. Rule</em>, 520 S.W.2d 463, 465\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1975, no writ).  Moreover, the party with whom the agent\r\ncontracts has no duty to discover the existence of an agency or the identity of the principal. \r\n<em>Hideca Petroleum Corp. v. Tampimex Oil Int'l Ltd.</em>, 740 S.W.2d 838, 842 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 1987, no writ).  Rather, the agent has the duty to disclose the agency relationship.  <em>Id.</em> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, King/Bumpous were entitled to introduce parol evidence to\r\nestablish CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal to the Agreement.  We conclude the trial court\r\ndid not err in admitting parol evidence on this issue and submitting the question to the jury.  We\r\noverrule CRB's first point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Jury Instructions On Actual Authority.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its third point of error, CRB contends the trial court erred in overruling its\r\nobjection to the instruction on actual authority included in Question No. 1 because the instruction\r\nwas an improper statement of the law.  Question No. 1 and the accompanying instructions were\r\nas follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDid Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. contract with Bryan King and Steve\r\nBumpous for performance of the services outlined in the Consulting Agreement?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may consider what\r\nthey said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including any earlier\r\ncourse of dealing.  You may not consider the parties' unexpressed thoughts or\r\nintentions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA corporation's conduct includes the conduct of a person who acts with the\r\ncorporation's authority.  \t        </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed that \"actual authority\" for a person to act for a\r\ncorporation arises from the corporation's agreement that the person act on behalf\r\nand for the benefit of the corporation.  If a corporation so authorizes a person to\r\nperform an act, that person is also authorized to do whatever is proper, usual, and\r\nnecessary to perform the act expressly authorized.  \"Actual authority\" also includes\r\nthe authority that the corporation either intentionally or by want of due care allows\r\nthe person to believe he has to represent the corporation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSpecifically, CRB asserts (1) the trial court did not give the proper instruction on\r\nimplied actual authority that this Court approved in <em>Duval County Ranch Co. v. Wooldridge</em>, 674\r\nS.W.2d 332, 334 (Tex. App.--Austin 1984, no writ); and (2) the \"hybrid actual\r\nauthority/negligence instruction\" is an incorrect statement of the law.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA principal confers actual authority on an agent by conduct that either intentionally\r\nor negligently allows <em>the agent</em> to believe he or she has been given actual authority to represent\r\nthe principal.  <em>Polland &amp; Cook v. Lehmann</em>, 832 S.W.2d 729, 738 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.]\r\n1992, writ denied); <em>Austin Teachers Fed. Credit Union v. First City Bank-Northwest Hills</em>, 825\r\nS.W.2d 795, 799 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ denied).  Actual authority includes both express\r\nand implied authority.  <em>Polland &amp; Cook</em>, 832 S.W.2d at 738.  Implied authority is the authority\r\nto do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise any authority granted to a person.  <em>Duval\r\nCounty Ranch Co.</em>, 674 S.W.2d at 334.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tContrary to CRB's assertion, the final paragraph of the above-quoted portion of the\r\ncharge does in fact include a correct definition of implied actual authority as expressed in <em>Duval\r\nCounty Ranch Co.</em>  <em>Id.</em>  Moreover, as stated above, a principal may negligently confer actual\r\nauthority on an agent by conduct that leads the agent to believe he has authority to act on behalf\r\nof the principal.<strong><sup> (13)</sup></strong></span><span>  We conclude the trial court did not err in overruling CRB's objection to the\r\ncharge.  We overrule CRB's third point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its fourth point of error, CRB contends the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nrefusing CRB's request to submit to the jury the following instruction on course and scope of\r\nauthority under Question No. 1:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are instructed that before you answer \"Yes\" to this question, you must find\r\nboth that Robert Walker had authority on behalf of Colorado River Broadcasters,\r\nInc. to execute the \"Consulting Agreement\" in its behalf, and that Robert Walker\r\nexecuted the \"Consulting Agreement\" while in the scope of his duties as an officer\r\nof Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc., as distinguished from his individual capacity\r\nas holder of the FCC approved KSSR-FM construction permit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tCRB's position is that the charge, as given, did not advise the jury that in order to\r\nfind CRB was a party to the Agreement, they first had to find Walker acted within the course and\r\nscope of his authority when he contracted with King/Bumpous.  King/Bumpous rejoin that the\r\ninstructions did in fact strictly limit the jury's consideration to Walker's actions it found to be\r\nwithin the scope of his authority.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is a basic rule of agency that the principal is not liable to a third party for an\r\nagent's acts in excess of his authority.  <em>Webb v. Webb</em>, 602 S.W.2d 127, 129 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Austin 1980, no writ).<strong><sup> (14)</sup></strong></span><span>  It was therefore incumbent upon King/Bumpous to secure a jury\r\nfinding that Walker's conduct in contracting with King/Bumpous was within the scope of his\r\nactual authority, either express or implied.  <em>See Pasadena Assocs. v. Connor</em>, 460 S.W.2d 473,\r\n479 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1970, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (stating that a finding of agency\r\nalone is insufficient without a finding that acts in question were within scope of agent's authority). \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court must submit such instructions and definitions as are proper to enable\r\nthe jury to render a verdict.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 277.  This rule affords the trial court broad\r\ndiscretion in determining what instructions to submit.  <em>Mobil Chem. Co. v. Bell</em>, 517 S.W.2d 245,\r\n256 (Tex. 1974).  An instruction is proper if it finds support in any evidence of probative force\r\nand if it might assist the jury in answering the questions submitted.  <em>Louisiana &amp; Ark. Ry. v.\r\nBlakely</em>, 773 S.W.2d 595, 598 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1989, writ denied).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the trial court instructed the jury that a corporation's conduct\r\nincluded the conduct of a person who acted with the corporation's authority, and correctly defined\r\nthe law on actual authority.  By finding that CRB was a party to the Agreement, the jury\r\nnecessarily found Walker acted within his actual authority in contracting with King/Bumpous. \r\nAny acts Walker had actual authority to perform were within the course and scope of his\r\nauthority.  Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing CRB's requested\r\nexplanatory instruction when its substance was already included in the charge.  <em>See id</em>. at 599. \r\nCRB was not entitled to submission of a requested instruction when it was merely a shade or\r\nrepetition of an instruction already in the charge.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 278; <em>Yellow Cab &amp;\r\nBaggage Co. v. Green</em>, 277 S.W.2d 92, 94-95 (Tex. 1955); <em>Louisiana &amp; Ark. Ry.</em>, 773 S.W.2d\r\nat 599.  In fact, the trial court should refuse to submit unnecessary instructions even if they\r\ncorrectly state the law.  <em>Louisiana &amp; Ark. Ry.</em>, 773 S.W.2d at 599.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to submit CRB's\r\nrequested instruction.  We overrule CRB's fourth point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>Legal and Factual Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its fifth point of error, CRB asserts that the evidence was legally insufficient,\r\nor in the alternative, factually insufficient, to support the jury's answer to Question No. 1.  CRB\r\ncontends that Walker's out-of-court statements, reported by King/Bumpous, were the sole\r\nevidence of Walker's agency relationship with CRB, and that such statements are the equivalent\r\nof no evidence.  <em>See Texoma Broadcasting Co. v. Darter</em>, 296 S.W.2d 277, 278 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Fort Worth 1956, no writ) (stating declarations of purported agent incompetent to establish\r\neither agency or scope of authority).  A complaint that the evidence was factually insufficient to\r\nsupport a jury finding must be raised by a motion for new trial.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 324(b)(2); Tex.\r\nR. App. P. 52(d).  Because CRB did not file a motion for new trial, it waived its factual\r\ninsufficiency point.<strong><sup> (15)</sup></strong></span><span>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing legal insufficiency points, we must consider only the evidence and\r\ninferences that tend to support the finding and disregard all evidence and inferences to the\r\ncontrary.  <em>Stafford v. Stafford</em>, 726 S.W.2d 14, 16 (Tex. 1987).  If there is any evidence of\r\nprobative force to support the finding, we must overrule the point and uphold the finding.  <em>In re\r\nKing's Estate</em>, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (Tex. 1951).  No-evidence points may be sustained only\r\nwhen the record discloses (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred\r\nby rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital\r\nfact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the\r\nevidence established conclusively the opposite of a vital fact.  <em>Cecil v. Smith</em>, 804 S.W.2d 509,\r\n510 n.2 (Tex. 1991).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous had the burden of proving Walker was acting as CRB's duly\r\nauthorized agent in contracting with them.<strong><sup> (16)</sup></strong></span><span>  <em>See</em> <em>Buchoz v. Klein</em>, 184 S.W.2d 271 (Tex. 1944);\r\n<em>Moore v. Office of the Attorney Gen.</em>, 820 S.W.2d 874, 877 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, no writ)\r\n(stating one who relies on existence of agency relationship or asserts act was within scope of\r\nagent's authority has burden of proving such allegations by preponderance of evidence).  The\r\nstatus of agency is one of ultimate fact derived from underlying facts and may be found from\r\neither direct or circumstantial evidence.  <em>Stanford v. Dairy Queen Prods.</em>, 623 S.W.2d 797, 800-01 (Tex. App.--Austin 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAgency is a consensual relationship between two parties in which one acts on behalf\r\nof the other, subject to the other's control.  <em>Noble Exploration, Inc. v. Nixon Drilling Co.</em>, 794\r\nS.W.2d 589, 592 (Tex. App.--Austin 1990, no writ); <em>see also Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. v.\r\nWalker County Agency, Inc.</em>, 808 S.W.2d 681, 687 (Tex.

Civ. App.--Amarillo 1967, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.) (noting no agency exists if party not acting on another's behalf).  Agency exists through\r\nthe express or implied contract of the parties, or is created by law.  <em>Green v. Hannon</em>, 369\r\nS.W.2d 853, 856 (Tex. Civ. App.--Texarkana 1963, writ ref'd n.r.e.).<strong><sup> (17)</sup></strong></span><span>  An agency relationship\r\nmay only arise at the will and by the act of the principal, and its existence must be proved by\r\ntracing it to some act of the principal.  <em>Thermo-Products Co. v. Chilton Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 647\r\nS.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex. App.--Waco 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is no presumption that actions of corporate agents are within the scope of\r\ntheir authority.  <em>Cotton Belt R.R.</em> <em>v.

In connection with that\r\nwork, they billed the station \"KSSR\" for $5,310 in March 1987, and CRB paid the bill.  Walker\r\nnever instructed King not to mention the consulting agreement to Foster.   \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSteve Bumpous testified that Walker acted on a daily basis on behalf of the Bastrop\r\nstation.  He hired and fired employees, ordered equipment, negotiated a lease for the building,\r\nand made arrangements for satellite programming.  Walker hired King and Bumpous to construct\r\nthe station under a separate agreement and CRB paid the bill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert Walker testified by deposition that he had whatever authority the corporate\r\ndocuments conferred on him.  He stated he took a more active role than Foster in pursuing the\r\nupgrade, and did all of the work.  He was unaware of any restrictions that CRB placed on his\r\nright to pursue the upgrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTolbert Foster testified he loaned Walker the money to purchase the construction\r\npermit.  Walker was to contribute the construction permit and the plans for an upgrade and Foster\r\nwas to contribute the financing.  Because of tax considerations, Foster and Walker agreed to form\r\na subchapter S corporation as the entity through which to develop the Bastrop station.  From the\r\nbeginning, they intended to transfer the construction permit to CRB when it became convenient. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCRB's certificate of incorporation, dated June 6, 1986, listed Foster and Walker\r\nas directors.  Foster testified that at the first meeting the board approved the by-laws, and elected\r\nFoster as president and Walker as vice-president and secretary.  The corporation issued 700 shares\r\nto Foster and 300 shares to Walker.  The by-laws provided that the vice-president \"shall perform\r\nthe duties and have the authority and exercise the powers of the president.  [He] shall perform\r\nsuch other duties and have such other authority as the . . . president may from time to time\r\ndelegate.\"  The president \"shall have general and active management and control of the business\r\nand affairs of the corporation . . . .\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster stated he was not aware of any restrictions, outside the corporate documents,\r\nplaced on Walker's authority to act for CRB.  Foster testified he and Walker had no delineation\r\nof duties; they just did things as they came up.  However, Walker did the active footwork.  Foster\r\nadmitted that Walker made arrangements for the studio, the equipment, and rented tower space,\r\nall in his own name, and CRB paid the bills.  Foster conceded that many of the contracts Walker\r\nmade in his own name, and that CRB paid, were not formally approved by the board of directors. \r\nBoth he and Walker wrote checks on the corporate checkbook.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJanette Hawkins testified that at the time of the events in this suit, she was the\r\npresident of Hawkins Broadcasting which owned KHLB, a radio station located in Burnet, Texas. \r\nHawkins Broadcasting contracted with the Bastrop station wherein the Bastrop station agreed to\r\ncompensate Hawkins Broadcasting for KHLB to change frequencies and move its tower site. \r\nNegotiations over the deal continued for several months, largely with Walker. The parties\r\nexecuted a final written agreement in December 1986.  Walker signed the contract simply as\r\n\"Robert W. Walker.\"  The contract does not mention CRB, although CRB is the entity that paid\r\nHawkins Broadcasting under the contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert Botik testified that he did sales consulting work for the Bastrop station\r\nbetween January and May 1987, and that Walker represented the Bastrop station in all their\r\ndealings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on the foregoing summary, we conclude the body of evidence provided a\r\nreasonable basis for concluding that Walker was CRB's agent in developing the Bastrop station,\r\nand that he acted within his authority in hiring King and Bumpous under the Agreement.  We\r\noverrule CRB's fifth point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>Admissibility of Walker's Out-of-Court Statements.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its second point of error, CRB asserts the trial court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence Walker's out-of-court statements, as reported by King/Bumpous, to prove Walker had\r\nauthority to bind CRB to the Agreement.<strong><sup> (19)</sup></strong>  CRB contends that the existence of an agency depends\r\non the purported <em>principal's</em> conduct, and that statements of an alleged agent, standing alone, are\r\nlegally insufficient to establish agency or the scope of authority.<strong><sup> (20)</sup></strong>  CRB maintains that there was\r\nno evidence that either CRB or Foster did anything to indicate Walker had authority to bind CRB\r\nto the Agreement, and therefore Walker's out-of-court statements were inadmissible to prove his\r\nactual authority.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous argue there was an abundance of other evidence to establish that\r\nWalker was CRB's duly authorized agent, and therefore, Walker's statements were admissible as\r\nparty admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 801(e)(2)(D) and as corroboration of other\r\nevidence of agency.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn alleged agent's out-of-court declarations, standing alone, are insufficient to\r\nestablish agency or the scope of authority, but once there is prima facie evidence to show the fact\r\nof agency, such statements may be admitted in corroboration.  <em>McAfee v. Travis Gas Corp.</em> 153\r\nS.W.2d 442, 448 (Tex. 1941);<em> Thermo-Products Co.</em>, 647 S.W.2d at 733.<strong><sup> (21)</sup></strong></span><span>  An out-of-court\r\nstatement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \"a statement by his agent or servant\r\nconcerning a matter within the scope of his agency or employment, during the existence of the\r\nrelationship . . . .\"  Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 801(e)(2)(D).  Thus, an out-of-court statement is\r\nadmissible under Rule 801(e)(2)(D) if: (1) the declarant was the party's agent, (2) at the time he\r\nmade the statement, and (3) the statement concerned a matter within the scope of the agency.<strong><sup> (22)</sup></strong></span><span> \r\n<em>See Fojtik v. First Nat'l Bank</em>, 752 S.W.2d 669, 672 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1988), <em>writ\r\ndenied per curiam</em>, 775 S.W.2d 632 (Tex. 1989);<em> State v. Buckner Constr. Co.</em>, 704 S.W.2d 837,\r\n846 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf there is a dispute regarding whether an agency relationship in fact existed or\r\nwhether the statement concerned a matter within the scope of the agency, the issue is for the court\r\nto determine before admitting the statement into evidence.  <em>See</em> <em>Handel v. Long Trusts</em>, 757\r\nS.W.2d 848, 851 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1988, no writ) (holding trial court properly excluded out-of-court statement when record did not show it concerned matter within scope of declarant's\r\nemployment); <em>Norton v. Martin</em>, 703 S.W.2d 267, 272 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1985, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.) (holding trial court properly excluded statements when evidence did not establish declarant\r\nwas party's employee or agent).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter CRB objected to the admission of Walker's out-of-court statements as\r\nevidence of his alleged authority to contract on CRB's behalf, the trial court ruled such testimony\r\nadmissible under rule 801(e)(2)(D), subject to the introduction of evidence sufficient to support\r\na finding that Walker was acting within the scope of his authority.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 104(b)\r\n(providing that when relevancy of evidence depends on fulfillment of condition of fact, court shall\r\nadmit it subject to introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the\r\ncondition).  The inquiry, then, is whether there was evidence apart from Walker's out-of-court\r\nstatements regarding his agency status and scope of authority in connection with CRB.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on our review of the evidence in connection with CRB's legal insufficiency\r\npoint above, we conclude that there was independent evidence that Walker was CRB's agent and\r\nthat he acted within the scope of his authority in contracting with King/Bumpous for consulting\r\nservices.  Specifically, we refer to Foster's testimony regarding the fact that Walker did all of the\r\nnecessary contracting for the Bastrop station and CRB paid the bills.  Foster stated further that\r\nCRB never restricted Walker's power to act on its behalf other than in the by-laws, which\r\nconferred generally the power to actively manage and control corporate business.  We conclude\r\nthe trial court did not err in admitting Walker's out-of-court statements regarding his agency for\r\nCRB and the scope of his authority.  We overrule CRB's second point of error.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we will affirm the judgment against CRB on the ground that CRB was\r\nWalker's undisclosed principal, any error in connection with the alternate ground of ratification\r\nis harmless.  <em>See Port Terminal R.R. Ass'n v. Richardson</em>, 808 S.W.2d 501, 508 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied); <em>Federal Pac. Elec. Co. v. Woodend</em>, 735 S.W.2d\r\n887, 896 (Tex.

We therefore need not address CRB's\r\npoints of error eight through fourteen, complaining of error regarding the ratification theory.  We\r\nalso need not address CRB's sixth and seventh points of error asserting the trial court erred in\r\ndenying CRB's motion for summary judgment and CRB's motion for judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ATTORNEY'S FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its fifteenth and sixteenth cross points of error, CRB asserts the trial court erred\r\nin submitting a question regarding King/Bumpous's attorney's fees to the jury, and in\r\nsubsequently refusing to modify the judgment to omit their recovery of attorney's fees.  CRB\r\nargues that King/Bumpous failed to plead and prove proper presentment of their claim to CRB as\r\nrequired by section 38.002(2) of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.002(2) (West 1986).<strong><sup> (23)</sup></strong>  Section 38.002(2) provides that in order to\r\nrecover attorney's fees under chapter 38 \"the claimant must present the claim to the opposing\r\nparty <em>or to a duly authorized agent of the opposing party</em> . . . .\"  (Emphasis added). \r\nKing/Bumpous respond that the record reflects they sent notice of their claim to Foster, CRB's\r\nregistered agent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t A prerequisite for recovery of attorney's fees is a presentment of the claim to the\r\nopposing party and that party's failure to tender performance within thirty days of presentment. \r\n<em>Jones v. Kelley</em>, 614 S.W.2d 95, 100 (Tex. 1981); <em>Jim Howe Homes, Inc. v. Rogers</em>, 818 S.W.2d\r\n901, 904 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, no writ).  The purpose of the presentment requirement is to\r\nafford the party against whom it is asserted an opportunity to pay the claim and thereby avoid\r\nincurring an obligation to pay attorney's fees.  <em>Jones</em>, 614 S.W.2d at 100; <em>Carrington v. Hart</em>, 703\r\nS.W.2d 814, 818 (Tex. App.--Austin 1986, no writ).  The record reflects that King/Bumpous\r\ncomplied with section 38.002(2) by presenting their claim to Foster, CRB's duly authorized agent,\r\nas the statute permits.  <em>See Richard Gill Co. v. Jackson's Landing</em>, 758 S.W.2d 921, 927 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied) (holding presentment of claim to partner constituted\r\npresentment to partnership).

Question No. 4 and the jury's response were as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDid Tolbert Foster <em>cause Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. to be used to\r\nperpetrate an actual fraud</em> on Bryan King and Steve Bumpous, <em>primarily for the\r\ndirect personal benefit of Tolbert Foster,</em> by distributing all or substantially all of\r\nthe corporation's assets to its shareholders, with the result that the corporation was\r\nrendered incapable of paying its debts?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  NO</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added).  A definition of actual fraud accompanied Question No. 4.  The source of the\r\nitalicized portions, of which King/Bumpous complain, is article 2.21 of the Texas Business\r\nCorporations Act.  Article 2.21 provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.  A holder of shares . . . shall be under no obligation to the corporation or to its\r\nobligees with respect to:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  (2) any contractual obligation of the corporation on the basis that the holder . .\r\n. is or was the alter ego of the corporation, or on the basis of actual or constructive\r\nfraud, or a sham to perpetrate a fraud, or other similar theory, unless the obligee\r\ndemonstrates that the holder . . . caused the corporation to be used for the purpose\r\nof perpetrating and did perpetrate an actual fraud on the obligee primarily for the\r\ndirect personal benefit of the holder . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>B.  The liability of a holder . . . of a corporation for an obligation that is limited\r\nby Section A of this article is exclusive and preempts any other liability imposed\r\non a holder . . . of a corporation for that obligation under common law or\r\notherwise, except that nothing contained in this article shall limit the obligation of\r\na holder . . . to an obligee of the corporation when:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>  (1)  the holder . . . has expressly assumed, guaranteed, or agreed to be personally\r\nliable to the obligee for the obligation; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>  (2)  the holder . . . is otherwise liable to the obligee for the obligations under this\r\nAct or another applicable statute.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 2.21 (West Supp. 1995).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous argue that article 2.21 applies solely to theories which function to\r\ndisregard the corporate entity and impose personal liability on the shareholder.  They assert the\r\ndenuding theory does not disregard the corporate entity because it does not impose unlimited\r\npersonal liability on shareholders for corporate obligations, but merely traces and attaches to\r\ncorporate assets in the hands of shareholders.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn interpreting a statute we must ascertain the legislature's intent.  <em>Minton v. Frank</em>,\r\n545 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex. 1976); <em>see also </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 312.005 (West 1988).  We\r\nbegin with an analysis of the statute.  <em>Cail v. Service Motors, Inc.</em>, 660 S.W.2d 814, 815 (Tex.\r\n1983).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe theories of actual fraud, constructive fraud, sham to perpetrate a fraud, and\r\nother similar theories enumerated in article 2.21(A)(2) are different grounds on which a court may\r\ndisregard the corporate entity and impose personal liability on shareholders for corporate\r\nobligations.<strong><sup> (24)</sup></strong></span><span>  <em>See Castleberry v. Branscum</em>, 721 S.W.2d 270, 272-73 (Tex. 1986).  Foster does\r\nnot dispute this contention, but instead argues that the denuding theory is in fact a means to pierce\r\nthe corporate veil, and therefore, is covered by the \"actual fraud\"  requirement of article\r\n2.21(A)(2).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe supreme court has stated that under the denuding theory a court does not\r\ndisregard the corporate entity.  <em>Castleberry</em>, 721 S.W.2d at 271 n.1.<strong><sup> (25)</sup></strong></span><span>  The court first recognized\r\nthe denuding theory in <em>World Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Bass</em>, 328 S.W.2d 863 (Tex. 1959). \r\nIn that case, the stockholders of a corporation sold all its assets and distributed the proceeds to\r\nthemselves.  In consequence, the corporation was unable to pay its  contractual obligation to\r\nWorld Broadcasting.  The supreme court stated the stockholders had \"denuded\" the corporation\r\nof its assets and therefore deprived corporate creditors of any funds from which to collect claims. \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 864.  The court held the stockholders liable for the corporation's outstanding debts to the\r\nextent of the corporate assets they had appropriated.  <em>Id.</em> at 864, 866.  The rationale for imposing\r\nliability on the assets the stockholders received was as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe law which sends a corporation into the world with the capacity to act\r\nimposes upon its assets liability for its acts.  The corporation cannot disable itself\r\nfrom responding by distributing its property among its stockholders, and leaving\r\nremediless those having valid claims.  In such a case the claims, after being\r\nreduced to judgments, may be satisfied out of the assets in the hands of the\r\nstockholders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[W]hen a corporation divests itself of all its assets by distributing them among\r\nthe stockholders, those having unsatisfied claims against it may follow the assets\r\n. . . .  A corporation cannot by divesting itself of all of its property, leave\r\nremediless the holder of a contingent claim, or the obligee of an executory contract\r\n. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> at 864-65 (quoting <em>Pierce v. United States</em>, 255 U.S. 398 (1920)).    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the denuding theory, the shareholder is liable for the corporate obligation\r\n<em>only</em> to the extent of the corporate assets received.  <em>Id.</em> at 864, 866; <em>A.R. Clark Inv. Co. v. Green</em>,\r\n375 S.W.2d 425, 437 (Tex. 1964); <em>Fagan v. La Gloria Oil &amp; Gas Co.</em>, 494 S.W.2d 624, 633\r\n(Tex. Civ.

Conversely,\r\nwhen a court disregards the corporate entity, personal liability for the full amount of the corporate\r\nobligation is imposed on the individual; his possession of <em>any</em> assets is immaterial to the issue of\r\nliability <em>vel non</em>.<strong><sup> (26)</sup></strong></span><span>  Under the denuding theory the court recognizes the corporation's separate\r\nidentity by tracing corporate assets into the hands of shareholders.  The corporate assets that a\r\nshareholder has received simply define the extent or amount of the shareholder's liability. \r\nBecause the denuding theory does not involve the piercing of the corporate veil, Foster's claim\r\nthat the denuding theory is the equivalent of actual fraud must fail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Proof of constructive fraud or other similar theories.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster further argues that the denuding theory is a form of constructive fraud, and\r\nthus falls within article 2.21(A)(2) on that basis.  On the contrary, in decisions addressing\r\nshareholder liability for corporate obligations, \"constructive fraud\" is a ground on which a\r\nclaimant may pierce the corporate veil without the burden of proving actual fraud.  <em>See\r\nCastleberry</em>, 721 S.W.2d at 273.<strong><sup> (27)</sup></strong></span><span>  We do not agree with Foster's contention that the denuding\r\ntheory is a form of constructive fraud.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a final effort to fit the denuding theory within article 2.21(A), Foster contends\r\nthat the legislature intended to include the denuding theory in article 2.21(A)(2) by inserting the\r\nwords \"or other similar theory.\"  However, every theory specifically listed in article 2.21(A)(2)\r\nis a \"piercing the corporate veil theory,\" and similarly, any other theory included in this article\r\nmust also involve piercing the corporate veil.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, where specific and particular enumerations of\r\npersons or things in a statute are followed by general words, the general words are\r\nnot to be construed in their wildest meaning or extent, but are to be treated as\r\nlimited and applying only to persons or things of the same kind or class as those\r\nexpressly mentioned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Standford v.

R. Civ. P. 278.  The trial court refused King/Bumpous's request to submit the following\r\nquestion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWere all or substantially all of the assets of Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc.\r\ndistributed to its stockholders, with the result that the corporation was rendered\r\nincapable of paying its debts?<strong><sup> (28)</sup></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSpecifically, Foster argues that in the cases applying the denuding theory <em>all</em> (not\r\n\"substantially all\") of the corporation's assets were distributed to stockholders.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>World\r\nBroadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at 863-64; <em>Inesco</em>, 567 S.W.2d at 830.  Foster contends the\r\ndenuding theory does not apply to this case because CRB continues to own a piece of land in\r\nBurnet County.<strong><sup> (29)</sup></strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough cases applying the denuding theory involve situations in which all of the\r\ncorporate assets were distributed, the rationale of the theory is that the law imposes on corporate\r\nassets liability for a corporation's acts.  <em>World Broadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at 864.  Therefore,\r\na corporation may not disable itself from satisfying its creditors' claims by distributing its assets\r\namong shareholders so as to leave without remedy those having valid claims.  <em>Id.</em> at 863-64; <em>A.\r\nR. Clark Inv.</em>, 375 S.W.2d at 437.  In <em>World Broadcasting System</em>, the supreme court noted that\r\nthe corporation had been \"stripped of its property as completely and effectively as if it had been\r\ndissolved and its assets appropriated by respondents.\"  <em>World Broadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at\r\n866.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the following facts are undisputed:  Foster and Walker\r\norganized CRB for the sole purpose of developing, upgrading, and eventually selling the Bastrop\r\nstation. The station has been sold, and all of the proceeds have been distributed.  Although Foster\r\nand Walker have not formally dissolved CRB, neither plans to conduct business through it.  Even\r\nthough CRB continues to own a piece of land in Burnet, its value is small in relation to the\r\ncorporate assets distributed.  CRB's distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop\r\nstation to Foster and Walker rendered CRB unable to pay its debt to King/Bumpous. \r\nKing/Bumpous are left with no remedy.  We do not believe that each and every asset must be\r\ndistributed before the denuding theory applies.  When the policies, purposes, and rationale behind\r\nthe theory are applicable, the theory applies.  They apply here and the expression referring to a\r\ndistribution of \"substantially all\" the corporate assets accurately posed the issue for the jury when\r\njoined with the remainder of the query.  We overrule Foster's first cross-point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Exceptions to exclusive liability under 2.21(B).</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster points to article 2.21(B) for the proposition that his liability under a\r\ndenuding theory is precluded because section (B) states that liability \"is exclusive and preempts\r\nany other liability imposed . . . under common law or otherwise . . . .\"  Tex. Bus. Corp. Act\r\nAnn. art. 2.21 (West Supp. 1995).  We disagree with Foster's interpretation of the statute.  His\r\ninterpretation does not account for subsection (B)(2), which provides a qualification to the rule. \r\nIn fact, a holder's liability is not limited when the holder is otherwise liable under another\r\napplicable statute.  <em>Id.</em>  Article 2.38(B) states: \"A distribution may not be made by a corporation\r\nif: (1) after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would be insolvent . . . .\"  Tex. Bus.\r\nCorp. Act Ann. art. 2.38(B) (West Supp. 1995).  The distribution of substantially all of CRB's\r\nassets effectively rendered the corporation insolvent and unable to pay its obligations to\r\nKing/Bumpous.  Therefore, the distribution was unlawful under article 2.38(B) and falls within\r\nthe article 2.21(B)(2) qualification.  We therefore overrule Foster's point of error contending that\r\nthe denuding theory is not subject to the limitations in article 2.21 set forth in his motion for\r\nrehearing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of our disposition of King/Bumpous's first point of error, we do not address\r\ntheir second point contending that the jury's failure to find Foster liable under the denuding theory\r\nwas against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span><center></center></span><strong>ALTER EGO THEORY</strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their third point of error, King/Bumpous assert that the jury's failure to find that\r\nFoster used CRB as his alter ego was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQuestion No. 3 inquired as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDid Tolbert Foster cause Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. to be used to\r\nperpetrate an actual fraud on Bryan King and Steve Bumpous, primarily for the\r\ndirect personal benefit of Tolbert Foster, by using the corporation as his alter ego?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  NO</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn accordance with article 2.21(A)(2), King/Bumpous bore the burden of proving\r\nthat by using the corporation as his alter ego, Foster used CRB to perpetrate an actual fraud on\r\nKing/Bumpous primarily for his direct personal benefit.  According to the trial court's instructions\r\ndefining actual fraud, King/Bumpous had to establish that (1) Foster, or his representative with\r\nFoster's knowledge, made a misstatement of material fact; (2) that was false; (3) made when\r\nFoster or his representative knew of its falsity or acted with reckless disregard for its truth; (4)\r\nmade with the intention that it should be acted upon; (5) and the party to whom it was made relied\r\nupon it and was harmed or damaged.      </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe will review the entire record to determine whether the jury's failure to find in\r\nKing/Bumpous's favor is so unjust in light of the evidence that the verdict cannot stand, having\r\ndue regard for the jury's collective wisdom, their opportunity to observe the witnesses, and our\r\nincapacity to weigh the evidence and find a fact differently.  <em>Pool v. Ford Motor Co.</em>, 715 S.W.2d\r\n629, 635 (Tex. 1986); William Powers, Jr. &amp; Jack Ratliff, <em>Another Look at \"No Evidence\" and\r\n\"Insufficient Evidence,\"</em> 79 Tex. L. Rev. 515, 525-26 (1991).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Review of the Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing testified Foster saw King and Bumpous doing maintenance work at the station\r\nfacility many times over a period of months even though they never submitted any bills.  Foster\r\nwas present at the meeting with Hawkins Broadcasting during which King played a large role in\r\npresenting the Bastrop station's proposal.  King stated he never mentioned the Agreement to\r\nFoster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBumpous also testified he never mentioned the Agreement to Foster, and that Foster\r\nobserved King/Bumpous doing work for the station.  According to both King's and Bumpous's\r\ntestimony, Foster never made any misstatements of fact to them about CRB's planned role in\r\ndeveloping the Bastrop station.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster testified he and Walker made a business decision to form CRB to develop\r\nand upgrade the Bastrop station based on tax considerations and limited personal liability.  They\r\ndecided to leave the construction permit in Walker's name until it became convenient to transfer\r\nit to CRB.  It became convenient when a buyer appeared who wished to close the deal as quickly\r\nas possible.  At that point, Walker and Foster amended CRB's charter so that Foster's seventy\r\nshares of outstanding stock became non-voting shares.  This allowed them to apply to the FCC\r\nfor a transfer of the permit using a short form.  This was the only reason to change the stock\r\nownership.  Foster testified they made an effort to use the short form to accommodate an anxious\r\nbuyer, not to avoid giving anyone the right to protest.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster acknowledged he was aware that King and Bumpous were providing\r\nengineering and technical assistance at the station, although he never saw a bill for such services. \r\nHe said that when he and Walker agreed to sell the Bastrop station, he asked Walker if they were\r\ngoing to owe King/Bumpous money, and Walker told him that he had a \"side agreement\" with\r\nthem.  Foster did not inquire about the terms of that agreement, and did not think it odd that\r\nWalker intended to pay King/Bumpous himself.  Walker testified by deposition that he had not\r\ndisclosed the Agreement to Foster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLee Peltzman, an attorney, testified by deposition that CRB's change in stock\r\nownership allowed Walker and Foster to use the shorter form to transfer ownership of the\r\nconstruction permit to CRB.  He stated that the advantages of using the short form are that it takes\r\nless time, costs less money, and there is no 30-day waiting period and requirement of public\r\nnotice.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous played a tape recording of a telephone call between the two of them\r\nand Foster that occurred in July 1989, after they were unable to contact Walker.  They had not\r\ntold Foster they were recording the call.  In the telephone call, Foster repeatedly stated he was\r\nnot aware of the Agreement.  He further said, \"I don't see how you could have an agreement with\r\nColorado River Broadcasters and me not be aware of it.\"  At one point King stated, \"I kind of\r\nsuspicioned that Bob had not shared that with you.\"  Foster later said, \"[Walker] wasn't\r\nauthorized to enter into that kind of agreement in my behalf.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous argue that the evidence establishes that Foster participated in\r\nintentionally concealing the true ownership of the Bastrop station.  They rely heavily on Foster's\r\nadmissions that although he and Walker always intended to transfer the construction permit to\r\nCRB when it became convenient, they continued to report Walker as the owner and manipulated\r\nCRB's stock to avoid using the long form (with its requisite public notice) for the transfer of the\r\npermit.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen considering great-weight points complaining of a jury's failure to find, we\r\nare particularly mindful that the jury was not convinced by a preponderance of the evidence. \r\n<em>Herbert v. Herbert</em>, 754 S.W.2d 141, 144 (Tex. 1988).  We may set aside the jury's failure to\r\nfind only if the great weight of that evidence dictates an affirmative answer.  <em>Id.</em>  As trier of fact,\r\nthe jury is the sole judge of the witnesses' credibility and the weight to be attached to their\r\ntestimony.  <em>Ethicon, Inc. v. Martinez</em>, 835 S.W.2d 826, 834 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ\r\ndenied).  We may not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses and substitute our judgment for\r\nthat of the jury simply because some of the evidence would support a different conclusion.  <em>Allied\r\nTowing Serv. v. Mitchell</em>, 833 S.W.2d 577, 582-83 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1992, no writ). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on the above summary of the evidence, we cannot say that the jury's failure\r\nto find Foster had purposefully used CRB to perpetrate a fraud on King/Bumpous is against the\r\ngreat weight of the evidence.<strong><sup> (30)</sup></strong>  We overrule King/Bumpous's third point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>COSTS</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his second cross-point of error, Foster asserts the trial court erred in refusing\r\nto award him his costs as a prevailing party without attempting to comply with Texas Rule of\r\nCivil Procedure 141.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 131 provides:  \"The successful party to a suit shall\r\nrecover of his adversary all costs incurred therein, except where otherwise provided.\"  However,\r\nthe trial court may adjudge costs otherwise, for good cause stated on the record.  Tex. R. Civ.\r\nP. 141.  It is error for the trial court to assess costs other than in accordance with rule 131 unless\r\nthe court states its reasons on the record.  <em>Neal v. Ardoin</em>, 594 S.W.2d 145, 147 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, no writ).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the final judgment, the trial court stated:  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe Court finds that the costs of court incurred in this cause are not capable of\r\nsegregation as between Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. and Tolbert Foster.

Moreover, Foster does not argue that the trial court's finding of good\r\ncause was an abuse of discretion.  <em>See</em> <em>Rogers v. Walmart Stores, Inc.</em>, 686 S.W.2d 599, 601\r\n(Tex. 1985) (review of trial judge's assessment of costs for good cause governed by abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard).

Foster, the president,\r\nowned seventy percent of CRB stock; Walker, the vice-president and secretary, owned the\r\nremaining thirty percent.  They agreed that CRB would build and operate the radio\r\nstation, and that any profits would be divided in accordance with the division of CRB\r\nstock ownership.   \r\n<p>2.      <strong>  Walker negotiated the terms of the Agreement in May 1986, before CRB was\r\nincorporated.  However, Walker reduced the Agreement to writing and signed it in\r\nOctober 1986, and King/Bumpous signed it in December 1986.\r\n<p>3.      <strong>  King/Bumpous first became aware of CRB's existence after they had performed\r\nunder the Agreement.  After constructing the station under a separate agreement with\r\nWalker, they billed the station for their work in March 1987.  CRB paid the bill.\r\n<p>4.      <strong>  CRB received a total of $5.25 million for the Bastrop station.\r\n<p>5.      <strong>  Foster testified that he received a check from CRB for $1,736,643.02;  Walker\r\nreceived a check for $741,704.15.\r\n<p>6.      <strong>  King/Bumpous had seen Foster only a few times during the years the Bastrop\r\nstation was in development, and had not mentioned the Agreement to him.  \r\n<p>7.      <strong>  CRB apparently purchased a large tract of land in Burnet as part of an\r\narrangement with a radio station in Burnet.  CRB conveyed approximately five acres of\r\nthe tract to the Burnet station, which agreed to build a new tower on a site that would not\r\ninterfere with the Bastrop station.  CRB still owns the remaining thirty-two acres\r\nadjacent to the Burnet station's tower.  King/Bumpous introduced the property tax\r\nappraisal of the land that listed its market value as $42,055.  In a footnote in their brief,\r\nFoster and CRB object to the admission of the property tax appraisal as evidence of\r\nmarket value, asserting that CRB paid nearly $100,000 for the land.  They do not raise a\r\npoint of error in this regard.  \r\n<p>8.       <sup>8</sup>  Walker filed for bankruptcy and is not a party to this suit.\r\n</p><p>9.       <sup>9</sup>  Foster's liability on the basis that he used CRB as his alter ego or that he denuded CRB\r\nof its corporate assets is dependent on CRB's liability under the Agreement.  We therefore\r\naddress CRB's points first.\r\n</p><p>10.      <strong>  Question No. 1 submitted the undisclosed principal theory as follows:  \"Did\r\nColorado River Broadcasters, Inc. contract with Bryan King and Steve Bumpous for\r\nperformance of the services outlined in the consulting agreement?\" (Definitions and\r\ninstructions omitted). \r\n<p>11.      <strong>  The Agreement does not allude to CRB.  The first sentence of the Agreement reads,\r\n\"For consulting services to Robert Walker, Bryan King and Steve Bumpous\r\n(King/Bumpous) will receive an amount equal to 5.5% of the net proceeds when KSSR-FM is sold.\"  Walker signed the Agreement simply as \"Robert W. Walker.\"\r\n<p>12.      <strong> The agent is also individually liable on the contract, although the third party must\r\nelect to recover from either the principal or the agent.  </strong><em>Medical Personnel Pool of Dallas,\r\nInc. v. Seale</em>, 554 S.W.2d 211, 214 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  \r\n</p><p>13.      <strong> In a post-submission brief, CRB appears to argue that the only type of authority a\r\nprincipal may confer negligently is </strong><em>apparent authority</em>.  Apparent authority, unlike actual\r\nauthority, is based on estoppel and arises from the principal's conduct that would lead a\r\nreasonably prudent <em>third party</em> to believe that the agent had authority to act.  <em>Curry v. Lone\r\nStar Steel Co.</em>, 676 S.W.2d 205, 210 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1984, no writ).  \"Thus, both\r\nactual and apparent authority depend for their creation on some manifestations, written or\r\nspoken words or conduct by the principal communicated either to the agent (actual authority)\r\nor to the third party (apparent authority).\"  <em>Id.</em>  Because a finding of apparent authority\r\ndepends upon conduct by the principal manifested to a third party, there can be no apparent\r\nauthority when the principal is not disclosed.  <em>Morey v. Page</em>, 802 S.W.2d 779, 785 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 1990, no writ).  \r\n</p><p>14.      <strong> A principal may also incur liability by subsequently ratifying the agent's\r\nunauthorized acts, or by conduct amounting to estoppel.  </strong><em>Longoria v. Atlantic Gulf Enters.,\r\nInc.</em>, 572 S.W.2d 71, 77 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\r\n</p><p>15.      <strong> CRB properly preserved its legal insufficiency complaint by raising it in a motion\r\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  </strong><em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Cecil v. Smith</em>, 804 S.W.2d 509, 510-11 (Tex. 1991) (\"no evidence\" points may be raised by either:  (1) a motion for instructed\r\nverdict; (2) a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; (3) an objection to the\r\nsubmission of the issue to the jury; (4) a motion to disregard the jury's answer to a vital fact\r\nissue; or (5) a motion for new trial).    \r\n</p><p>16.      <strong> Although Walker was CRB's vice-president, a corporate officer has no inherent\r\nauthority to bind by virtue of his office.  </strong><em>See</em> <em>Templeton v. Nocona Hills Owners Ass'n, Inc.</em>,\r\n555 S.W.2d 534, 538 (Tex. Civ. App.--Texarkana 1977, no writ). A corporation's board of\r\ndirectors, not its officers, is charged by statute with managing corporate affairs.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nBus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 2.31 (West Supp. 1995); <em>Templeton</em>, 555 S.W.2d at 537; <em>Ennis\r\nBusiness Forms, Inc. v. Todd</em>, 523 S.W.2d 83, 85 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1975, no writ).   \r\n</p><p>17.      <strong> An express agency is usually created by written agreement and an implied agency is\r\ncreated by an oral contract or a consensual relationship.  </strong><em>Green</em>, 369 S.W.2d at 856; <em>see\r\nalso Orozco v. Sander</em>, 824 S.W.2d 555, 556 (Tex. 1992) (noting existence of agency does not\r\ndepend on express appointment by principal, but may be implied from parties' conduct under\r\nthe circumstances); <em>Carr v.

App.--Dallas 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.)\r\n(noting consent of principal and agent necessary to create agency, which may be express or\r\nimplied by their words and conduct).  There is no difference in principle between an express\r\nand implied contract of agency, but the terms reflect differences in the character of proof by\r\nwhich the relationship of principal and agent is established.  <em>McDorman v. Goodell</em>, 69\r\nS.W.2d 428, 432 (Tex. Civ. App.--El Paso 1934, no writ).  \r\n</p><p>18.      <strong> Article 2.42(B) provides:  \"All officers and agents of the corporation, as between\r\nthemselves and the corporation, shall have such authority and perform such duties in the\r\nmanagement of the corporation as may be provided in the bylaws, or as may be\r\ndetermined by resolution of the board of directors not inconsistent with the bylaws.\"  Tex.\r\nBus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 2.42(B) (West 1980).\r\n<p>19.      <strong> CRB does not point to any specific testimony by King or Bumpous during which\r\nthey quoted Walker, but objects generally to all such testimony.\r\n<p>20.      <strong> It is not entirely clear from CRB's brief whether it is arguing: (1) there was no\r\nindependent evidence that Walker was CRB's agent; or (2) although Walker was CRB's\r\nagent, there was no independent evidence Walker was acting within the scope of his\r\nauthority in entering the Consulting Agreement with King/Bumpous.  We will address\r\nboth contentions in our opinion.\r\n<p>21.      <strong> The general rule that an alleged agent's declarations are inadmissible against the\r\nprincipal without independent evidence of agency does not apply to an agent's in-court\r\ntestimony.  </strong><em>Cook v.

Courts will not disregard the corporate entity unless the\r\nindividuals are using the corporate form as a sham to perpetrate a fraud, to escape personal\r\nliability, to avoid the effect of a statute, or in a few other exceptional situations.  <em>Torregrossa\r\nv.

This is incorrect in light of the supreme court's statement in\r\n<em>Castleberry </em>that the denuding theory is not a basis on which to disregard the corporate entity,\r\nbut is a distinct doctrine.  <em>Castleberry</em>, 721 S.W.2d at 271 n.1.\r\n</p><p>27.      <strong> As the dissent noted in </strong><em>Castleberry</em>, this holding was a significant departure from\r\nprevious decisions holding that the corporate veil would be pierced only in extraordinary\r\ncircumstances.  <em>Castleberry</em>, 721 S.W.2d at 277 (Gonzalez, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). \r\nSuch a standard allowed courts to pierce the corporate veil any time it would be unfair to\r\nrecognize the corporate existence.  <em>Id.</em>  In an apparent response to <em>Castleberry</em>, the legislature\r\namended article 2.21 in 1989.

Walker supplied the Federal Communications\r\nCommission (\"FCC\") construction permit that he had previously obtained in his own name, and\r\nmanaged the building and upgrading of the station.  Although Walker and Foster intended to\r\ntransfer the construction permit to CRB at some point, they decided to leave it temporarily in\r\nWalker's name.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker contracted with broadcasting consultants King and Bumpous for consulting\r\nservices in connection with the development of the Bastrop station.<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong>  The consulting agreement\r\n(the \"Agreement\") provided that in return for consulting and other services, King/Bumpous would\r\nreceive 5.5 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop station.  King/Bumpous were\r\nunaware of CRB's existence or of its role as the developer of the Bastrop station.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong>  On its face,\r\nthe Agreement purported to be between King/Bumpous and Walker, and did not mention either\r\nFoster or CRB.  Walker signed the Agreement simply, \"Robert W. Walker.\"  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous performed services through December 1986 on behalf of the Bastrop\r\nstation and in accordance with the Agreement.  At that time, CRB and Walker contracted to sell\r\nthe Bastrop station to Beasley Broadcasting, although Walker was still the record owner.  On\r\nJanuary 6, 1987, the completed station requested a new broadcast station license, still reporting\r\nWalker as the station's owner.  On January 20, 1987, Walker transferred the permit to CRB.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn March 30, 1987, CRB and Beasley Broadcasting executed an agreement for sale\r\nof the Bastrop station under which CRB would receive $1 million for the Class A station, and\r\nwould receive an additional $3 million plus $1.25 million in non-competition agreements if the\r\nFCC approved an upgrade to a Class C/2 station.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker informed King/Bumpous of the terms of the sale.  He advised them that he\r\nhad used the initial $1 million payment to cover costs, and there would be no net proceeds for\r\ndistribution until the upgrade was approved.  Due to a long delay, the FCC did not approve the\r\nupgrade until early 1989, at which time Beasley Broadcasting made the second payment to CRB.<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong> \r\nCRB distributed all of the proceeds to Walker and Foster.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 1989, when King/Bumpous were unable to get in touch with Walker, they\r\ncontacted Foster and learned that Walker and Foster had received the proceeds from the sale. \r\nFoster told them he knew nothing about the Agreement.<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong>  CRB no longer actively engages in\r\nbusiness and its only remaining asset is a 32-acre tract of land in Burnet County.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong>  CRB is unable\r\nto pay King/Bumpous the amount owed under the Agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous sued CRB to recover under the Agreement on alternate theories: \r\n(1) CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal in the Agreement; or (2) CRB ratified the\r\nAgreement.  The jury found CRB liable on both theories and fixed damages in the amount of\r\n$147,573.69, representing 5.5 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop station. \r\nAdditionally, King/Bumpous sought to recover contract damages against Foster<strong><sup> (8)</sup></strong></span><span> under alternative\r\ntheories:  (1) Foster had used CRB as his alter ego; or (2) Foster had \"denuded\" CRB by\r\ndistributing substantially all of its assets, thus rendering it incapable of paying its debts.  The jury\r\nfailed to find Foster liable under either theory.  These appeals ensued.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL THEORY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Parol Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first point of error,<strong><sup> (9)</sup></strong></span><span> CRB asserts the trial court erred in submitting the case\r\nto the jury on the theory that CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal.<strong><sup> (10)</sup></strong>  CRB contends that the\r\nAgreement unambiguously indicates that Walker, not CRB, contracted with King/Bumpous, and\r\ntherefore, parol evidence was inadmissible to vary its terms.<strong><sup> (11)</sup></strong>  CRB concludes that the trial court\r\nshould have construed the Agreement as a matter of law with respect to the identity of the\r\ncontracting parties, rather than submitting the issue to the jury.  King/Bumpous respond that parol\r\nevidence was admissible to prove CRB was Walker's undisclosed principal, and that Walker was\r\nacting as CRB's agent.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen an agent acts within the scope of his authority and contracts in his own name\r\non behalf of an undisclosed principal, the contract is enforceable against the principal.  <em>First Nat'l\r\nBank v.

Question No. 1 and the accompanying instructions were\r\nas follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDid Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. contract with Bryan King and Steve\r\nBumpous for performance of the services outlined in the Consulting Agreement?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may consider what\r\nthey said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including any earlier\r\ncourse of dealing.

We overrule CRB's third point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its fourth point of error, CRB contends the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nrefusing CRB's request to submit to the jury the following instruction on course and scope of\r\nauthority under Question No. 1:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are instructed that before you answer \"Yes\" to this question, you must find\r\nboth that Robert Walker had authority on behalf of Colorado River Broadcasters,\r\nInc. to execute the \"Consulting Agreement\" in its behalf, and that Robert Walker\r\nexecuted the \"Consulting Agreement\" while in the scope of his duties as an officer\r\nof Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc., as distinguished from his individual capacity\r\nas holder of the FCC approved KSSR-FM construction permit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tCRB's position is that the charge, as given, did not advise the jury that in order to\r\nfind CRB was a party to the Agreement, they first had to find Walker acted within the course and\r\nscope of his authority when he contracted with King/Bumpous.  King/Bumpous rejoin that the\r\ninstructions did in fact strictly limit the jury's consideration to Walker's actions it found to be\r\nwithin the scope of his authority.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is a basic rule of agency that the principal is not liable to a third party for an\r\nagent's acts in excess of his authority.  <em>Webb v.

Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing CRB's requested\r\nexplanatory instruction when its substance was already included in the charge.  <em>See id</em>. at 599. \r\nCRB was not entitled to submission of a requested instruction when it was merely a shade or\r\nrepetition of an instruction already in the charge.  <em>See</em> Tex.

In connection with that\r\nwork, they billed the station \"KSSR\" for $5,310 in March 1987, and CRB paid the bill.  Walker\r\nnever instructed King not to mention the consulting agreement to Foster.   \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSteve Bumpous testified that Walker acted on a daily basis on behalf of the Bastrop\r\nstation.  He hired and fired employees, ordered equipment, negotiated a lease for the building,\r\nand made arrangements for satellite programming.  Walker hired King and Bumpous to construct\r\nthe station under a separate agreement and CRB paid the bill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert Walker testified by deposition that he had whatever authority the corporate\r\ndocuments conferred on him.  He stated he took a more active role than Foster in pursuing the\r\nupgrade, and did all of the work.  He was unaware of any restrictions that CRB placed on his\r\nright to pursue the upgrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTolbert Foster testified he loaned Walker the money to purchase the construction\r\npermit.  Walker was to contribute the construction permit and the plans for an upgrade and Foster\r\nwas to contribute the financing.  Because of tax considerations, Foster and Walker agreed to form\r\na subchapter S corporation as the entity through which to develop the Bastrop station.  From the\r\nbeginning, they intended to transfer the construction permit to CRB when it became convenient. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCRB's certificate of incorporation, dated June 6, 1986, listed Foster and Walker\r\nas directors.  Foster testified that at the first meeting the board approved the by-laws, and elected\r\nFoster as president and Walker as vice-president and secretary.  The corporation issued 700 shares\r\nto Foster and 300 shares to Walker.  The by-laws provided that the vice-president \"shall perform\r\nthe duties and have the authority and exercise the powers of the president.  [He] shall perform\r\nsuch other duties and have such other authority as the . . . president may from time to time\r\ndelegate.\"  The president \"shall have general and active management and control of the business\r\nand affairs of the corporation . . . .\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster stated he was not aware of any restrictions, outside the corporate documents,\r\nplaced on Walker's authority to act for CRB.  Foster testified he and Walker had no delineation\r\nof duties; they just did things as they came up.  However, Walker did the active footwork.  Foster\r\nadmitted that Walker made arrangements for the studio, the equipment, and rented tower space,\r\nall in his own name, and CRB paid the bills.  Foster conceded that many of the contracts Walker\r\nmade in his own name, and that CRB paid, were not formally approved by the board of directors. \r\nBoth he and Walker wrote checks on the corporate checkbook.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJanette Hawkins testified that at the time of the events in this suit, she was the\r\npresident of Hawkins Broadcasting which owned KHLB, a radio station located in Burnet, Texas. \r\nHawkins Broadcasting contracted with the Bastrop station wherein the Bastrop station agreed to\r\ncompensate Hawkins Broadcasting for KHLB to change frequencies and move its tower site. \r\nNegotiations over the deal continued for several months, largely with Walker. The parties\r\nexecuted a final written agreement in December 1986.  Walker signed the contract simply as\r\n\"Robert W. Walker.\"  The contract does not mention CRB, although CRB is the entity that paid\r\nHawkins Broadcasting under the contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert Botik testified that he did sales consulting work for the Bastrop station\r\nbetween January and May 1987, and that Walker represented the Bastrop station in all their\r\ndealings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on the foregoing summary, we conclude the body of evidence provided a\r\nreasonable basis for concluding that Walker was CRB's agent in developing the Bastrop station,\r\nand that he acted within his authority in hiring King and Bumpous under the Agreement.  We\r\noverrule CRB's fifth point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>Admissibility of Walker's Out-of-Court Statements.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its second point of error, CRB asserts the trial court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence Walker's out-of-court statements, as reported by King/Bumpous, to prove Walker had\r\nauthority to bind CRB to the Agreement.<strong><sup> (19)</sup></strong>  CRB contends that the existence of an agency depends\r\non the purported <em>principal's</em> conduct, and that statements of an alleged agent, standing alone, are\r\nlegally insufficient to establish agency or the scope of authority.<strong><sup> (20)</sup></strong>  CRB maintains that there was\r\nno evidence that either CRB or Foster did anything to indicate Walker had authority to bind CRB\r\nto the Agreement, and therefore Walker's out-of-court statements were inadmissible to prove his\r\nactual authority.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous argue there was an abundance of other evidence to establish that\r\nWalker was CRB's duly authorized agent, and therefore, Walker's statements were admissible as\r\nparty admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 801(e)(2)(D) and as corroboration of other\r\nevidence of agency.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn alleged agent's out-of-court declarations, standing alone, are insufficient to\r\nestablish agency or the scope of authority, but once there is prima facie evidence to show the fact\r\nof agency, such statements may be admitted in corroboration.  <em>McAfee v.

R. Civ. Evid. 104(b)\r\n(providing that when relevancy of evidence depends on fulfillment of condition of fact, court shall\r\nadmit it subject to introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the\r\ncondition).  The inquiry, then, is whether there was evidence apart from Walker's out-of-court\r\nstatements regarding his agency status and scope of authority in connection with CRB.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on our review of the evidence in connection with CRB's legal insufficiency\r\npoint above, we conclude that there was independent evidence that Walker was CRB's agent and\r\nthat he acted within the scope of his authority in contracting with King/Bumpous for consulting\r\nservices.  Specifically, we refer to Foster's testimony regarding the fact that Walker did all of the\r\nnecessary contracting for the Bastrop station and CRB paid the bills.  Foster stated further that\r\nCRB never restricted Walker's power to act on its behalf other than in the by-laws, which\r\nconferred generally the power to actively manage and control corporate business.  We conclude\r\nthe trial court did not err in admitting Walker's out-of-court statements regarding his agency for\r\nCRB and the scope of his authority.  We overrule CRB's second point of error.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we will affirm the judgment against CRB on the ground that CRB was\r\nWalker's undisclosed principal, any error in connection with the alternate ground of ratification\r\nis harmless.  <em>See Port Terminal R.R.

The corporate assets that a\r\nshareholder has received simply define the extent or amount of the shareholder's liability. \r\nBecause the denuding theory does not involve the piercing of the corporate veil, Foster's claim\r\nthat the denuding theory is the equivalent of actual fraud must fail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Proof of constructive fraud or other similar theories.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster further argues that the denuding theory is a form of constructive fraud, and\r\nthus falls within article 2.21(A)(2) on that basis.  On the contrary, in decisions addressing\r\nshareholder liability for corporate obligations, \"constructive fraud\" is a ground on which a\r\nclaimant may pierce the corporate veil without the burden of proving actual fraud.  <em>See\r\nCastleberry</em>, 721 S.W.2d at 273.<strong><sup> (27)</sup></strong></span><span>  We do not agree with Foster's contention that the denuding\r\ntheory is a form of constructive fraud.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a final effort to fit the denuding theory within article 2.21(A), Foster contends\r\nthat the legislature intended to include the denuding theory in article 2.21(A)(2) by inserting the\r\nwords \"or other similar theory.\"  However, every theory specifically listed in article 2.21(A)(2)\r\nis a \"piercing the corporate veil theory,\" and similarly, any other theory included in this article\r\nmust also involve piercing the corporate veil.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, where specific and particular enumerations of\r\npersons or things in a statute are followed by general words, the general words are\r\nnot to be construed in their wildest meaning or extent, but are to be treated as\r\nlimited and applying only to persons or things of the same kind or class as those\r\nexpressly mentioned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Standford v.

We\r\ntherefore sustain King/Bumpous's first point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Submission of the Denuding Theory.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his first cross-point of error, Foster asserts the trial court should not have\r\nsubmitted the denuding theory to the jury because it is not applicable to this case and\r\nKing/Bumpous failed to tender a question on the denuding theory in substantially correct wording. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 278.  The trial court refused King/Bumpous's request to submit the following\r\nquestion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWere all or substantially all of the assets of Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc.\r\ndistributed to its stockholders, with the result that the corporation was rendered\r\nincapable of paying its debts?<strong><sup> (28)</sup></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSpecifically, Foster argues that in the cases applying the denuding theory <em>all</em> (not\r\n\"substantially all\") of the corporation's assets were distributed to stockholders.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>World\r\nBroadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at 863-64; <em>Inesco</em>, 567 S.W.2d at 830.  Foster contends the\r\ndenuding theory does not apply to this case because CRB continues to own a piece of land in\r\nBurnet County.<strong><sup> (29)</sup></strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough cases applying the denuding theory involve situations in which all of the\r\ncorporate assets were distributed, the rationale of the theory is that the law imposes on corporate\r\nassets liability for a corporation's acts.  <em>World Broadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at 864.  Therefore,\r\na corporation may not disable itself from satisfying its creditors' claims by distributing its assets\r\namong shareholders so as to leave without remedy those having valid claims.  <em>Id.</em> at 863-64; <em>A.\r\nR. Clark Inv.</em>, 375 S.W.2d at 437.  In <em>World Broadcasting System</em>, the supreme court noted that\r\nthe corporation had been \"stripped of its property as completely and effectively as if it had been\r\ndissolved and its assets appropriated by respondents.\"  <em>World Broadcasting Sys.</em>, 328 S.W.2d at\r\n866.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the following facts are undisputed:  Foster and Walker\r\norganized CRB for the sole purpose of developing, upgrading, and eventually selling the Bastrop\r\nstation. The station has been sold, and all of the proceeds have been distributed.  Although Foster\r\nand Walker have not formally dissolved CRB, neither plans to conduct business through it.  Even\r\nthough CRB continues to own a piece of land in Burnet, its value is small in relation to the\r\ncorporate assets distributed.  CRB's distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of the Bastrop\r\nstation to Foster and Walker rendered CRB unable to pay its debt to King/Bumpous. \r\nKing/Bumpous are left with no remedy.  We do not believe that each and every asset must be\r\ndistributed before the denuding theory applies.  When the policies, purposes, and rationale behind\r\nthe theory are applicable, the theory applies.  They apply here and the expression referring to a\r\ndistribution of \"substantially all\" the corporate assets accurately posed the issue for the jury when\r\njoined with the remainder of the query.  We overrule Foster's first cross-point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Exceptions to exclusive liability under 2.21(B).</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster points to article 2.21(B) for the proposition that his liability under a\r\ndenuding theory is precluded because section (B) states that liability \"is exclusive and preempts\r\nany other liability imposed . . . under common law or otherwise . . . .\"  Tex. Bus. Corp. Act\r\nAnn. art. 2.21 (West Supp. 1995).  We disagree with Foster's interpretation of the statute.  His\r\ninterpretation does not account for subsection (B)(2), which provides a qualification to the rule. \r\nIn fact, a holder's liability is not limited when the holder is otherwise liable under another\r\napplicable statute.  <em>Id.</em>  Article 2.38(B) states: \"A distribution may not be made by a corporation\r\nif: (1) after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would be insolvent . . . .\"  Tex. Bus.\r\nCorp. Act Ann. art. 2.38(B) (West Supp. 1995).  The distribution of substantially all of CRB's\r\nassets effectively rendered the corporation insolvent and unable to pay its obligations to\r\nKing/Bumpous.  Therefore, the distribution was unlawful under article 2.38(B) and falls within\r\nthe article 2.21(B)(2) qualification.  We therefore overrule Foster's point of error contending that\r\nthe denuding theory is not subject to the limitations in article 2.21 set forth in his motion for\r\nrehearing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of our disposition of King/Bumpous's first point of error, we do not address\r\ntheir second point contending that the jury's failure to find Foster liable under the denuding theory\r\nwas against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span><center></center></span><strong>ALTER EGO THEORY</strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their third point of error, King/Bumpous assert that the jury's failure to find that\r\nFoster used CRB as his alter ego was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQuestion No. 3 inquired as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDid Tolbert Foster cause Colorado River Broadcasters, Inc. to be used to\r\nperpetrate an actual fraud on Bryan King and Steve Bumpous, primarily for the\r\ndirect personal benefit of Tolbert Foster, by using the corporation as his alter ego?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  NO</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn accordance with article 2.21(A)(2), King/Bumpous bore the burden of proving\r\nthat by using the corporation as his alter ego, Foster used CRB to perpetrate an actual fraud on\r\nKing/Bumpous primarily for his direct personal benefit.  According to the trial court's instructions\r\ndefining actual fraud, King/Bumpous had to establish that (1) Foster, or his representative with\r\nFoster's knowledge, made a misstatement of material fact; (2) that was false; (3) made when\r\nFoster or his representative knew of its falsity or acted with reckless disregard for its truth; (4)\r\nmade with the intention that it should be acted upon; (5) and the party to whom it was made relied\r\nupon it and was harmed or damaged.      </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe will review the entire record to determine whether the jury's failure to find in\r\nKing/Bumpous's favor is so unjust in light of the evidence that the verdict cannot stand, having\r\ndue regard for the jury's collective wisdom, their opportunity to observe the witnesses, and our\r\nincapacity to weigh the evidence and find a fact differently.  <em>Pool v.

Foster\r\nwas present at the meeting with Hawkins Broadcasting during which King played a large role in\r\npresenting the Bastrop station's proposal.  King stated he never mentioned the Agreement to\r\nFoster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBumpous also testified he never mentioned the Agreement to Foster, and that Foster\r\nobserved King/Bumpous doing work for the station.  According to both King's and Bumpous's\r\ntestimony, Foster never made any misstatements of fact to them about CRB's planned role in\r\ndeveloping the Bastrop station.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster testified he and Walker made a business decision to form CRB to develop\r\nand upgrade the Bastrop station based on tax considerations and limited personal liability.  They\r\ndecided to leave the construction permit in Walker's name until it became convenient to transfer\r\nit to CRB.  It became convenient when a buyer appeared who wished to close the deal as quickly\r\nas possible.  At that point, Walker and Foster amended CRB's charter so that Foster's seventy\r\nshares of outstanding stock became non-voting shares.  This allowed them to apply to the FCC\r\nfor a transfer of the permit using a short form.  This was the only reason to change the stock\r\nownership.  Foster testified they made an effort to use the short form to accommodate an anxious\r\nbuyer, not to avoid giving anyone the right to protest.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFoster acknowledged he was aware that King and Bumpous were providing\r\nengineering and technical assistance at the station, although he never saw a bill for such services. \r\nHe said that when he and Walker agreed to sell the Bastrop station, he asked Walker if they were\r\ngoing to owe King/Bumpous money, and Walker told him that he had a \"side agreement\" with\r\nthem.  Foster did not inquire about the terms of that agreement, and did not think it odd that\r\nWalker intended to pay King/Bumpous himself.  Walker testified by deposition that he had not\r\ndisclosed the Agreement to Foster.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLee Peltzman, an attorney, testified by deposition that CRB's change in stock\r\nownership allowed Walker and Foster to use the shorter form to transfer ownership of the\r\nconstruction permit to CRB.  He stated that the advantages of using the short form are that it takes\r\nless time, costs less money, and there is no 30-day waiting period and requirement of public\r\nnotice.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous played a tape recording of a telephone call between the two of them\r\nand Foster that occurred in July 1989, after they were unable to contact Walker.  They had not\r\ntold Foster they were recording the call.  In the telephone call, Foster repeatedly stated he was\r\nnot aware of the Agreement.  He further said, \"I don't see how you could have an agreement with\r\nColorado River Broadcasters and me not be aware of it.\"  At one point King stated, \"I kind of\r\nsuspicioned that Bob had not shared that with you.\"  Foster later said, \"[Walker] wasn't\r\nauthorized to enter into that kind of agreement in my behalf.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKing/Bumpous argue that the evidence establishes that Foster participated in\r\nintentionally concealing the true ownership of the Bastrop station.  They rely heavily on Foster's\r\nadmissions that although he and Walker always intended to transfer the construction permit to\r\nCRB when it became convenient, they continued to report Walker as the owner and manipulated\r\nCRB's stock to avoid using the long form (with its requisite public notice) for the transfer of the\r\npermit.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen considering great-weight points complaining of a jury's failure to find, we\r\nare particularly mindful that the jury was not convinced by a preponderance of the evidence. \r\n<em>Herbert v.

Foster, the president,\r\nowned seventy percent of CRB stock; Walker, the vice-president and secretary, owned the\r\nremaining thirty percent.  They agreed that CRB would build and operate the radio\r\nstation, and that any profits would be divided in accordance with the division of CRB\r\nstock ownership.   \r\n<p>2.      <strong>  Walker negotiated the terms of the Agreement in May 1986, before CRB was\r\nincorporated.  However, Walker reduced the Agreement to writing and signed it in\r\nOctober 1986, and King/Bumpous signed it in December 1986.\r\n<p>3.      <strong>  King/Bumpous first became aware of CRB's existence after they had performed\r\nunder the Agreement.  After constructing the station under a separate agreement with\r\nWalker, they billed the station for their work in March 1987.  CRB paid the bill.\r\n<p>4.      <strong>  CRB received a total of $5.25 million for the Bastrop station.\r\n<p>5.      <strong>  Foster testified that he received a check from CRB for $1,736,643.02;  Walker\r\nreceived a check for $741,704.15.\r\n<p>6.      <strong>  King/Bumpous had seen Foster only a few times during the years the Bastrop\r\nstation was in development, and had not mentioned the Agreement to him.  \r\n<p>7.      <strong>  CRB apparently purchased a large tract of land in Burnet as part of an\r\narrangement with a radio station in Burnet.  CRB conveyed approximately five acres of\r\nthe tract to the Burnet station, which agreed to build a new tower on a site that would not\r\ninterfere with the Bastrop station.  CRB still owns the remaining thirty-two acres\r\nadjacent to the Burnet station's tower.  King/Bumpous introduced the property tax\r\nappraisal of the land that listed its market value as $42,055.  In a footnote in their brief,\r\nFoster and CRB object to the admission of the property tax appraisal as evidence of\r\nmarket value, asserting that CRB paid nearly $100,000 for the land.  They do not raise a\r\npoint of error in this regard.  \r\n<p>8.       <sup>8</sup>  Walker filed for bankruptcy and is not a party to this suit.\r\n</p><p>9.       <sup>9</sup>  Foster's liability on the basis that he used CRB as his alter ego or that he denuded CRB\r\nof its corporate assets is dependent on CRB's liability under the Agreement.  We therefore\r\naddress CRB's points first.\r\n</p><p>10.      <strong>  Question No. 1 submitted the undisclosed principal theory as follows:  \"Did\r\nColorado River Broadcasters, Inc. contract with Bryan King and Steve Bumpous for\r\nperformance of the services outlined in the consulting agreement?\" (Definitions and\r\ninstructions omitted). \r\n<p>11.      <strong>  The Agreement does not allude to CRB.  The first sentence of the Agreement reads,\r\n\"For consulting services to Robert Walker, Bryan King and Steve Bumpous\r\n(King/Bumpous) will receive an amount equal to 5.5% of the net proceeds when KSSR-FM is sold.\"  Walker signed the Agreement simply as \"Robert W. Walker.\"\r\n<p>12.      <strong> The agent is also individually liable on the contract, although the third party must\r\nelect to recover from either the principal or the agent.  </strong><em>Medical Personnel Pool of Dallas,\r\nInc. v.

Civ. App.--Dallas 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  \r\n</p><p>13.      <strong> In a post-submission brief, CRB appears to argue that the only type of authority a\r\nprincipal may confer negligently is </strong><em>apparent authority</em>.  Apparent authority, unlike actual\r\nauthority, is based on estoppel and arises from the principal's conduct that would lead a\r\nreasonably prudent <em>third party</em> to believe that the agent had authority to act.  <em>Curry v. Lone\r\nStar Steel Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1484151\"><a href=\"/opinion/1484151/currey-v-lone-star-steel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 210 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1984, no writ).  \"Thus, both\r\nactual and apparent authority depend for their creation on some manifestations, written or\r\nspoken words or conduct by the principal communicated either to the agent (actual authority)\r\nor to the third party (apparent authority).\"  <em>Id.</em>  Because a finding of apparent authority\r\ndepends upon conduct by the principal manifested to a third party, there can be no apparent\r\nauthority when the principal is not disclosed.  <em>Morey v.
