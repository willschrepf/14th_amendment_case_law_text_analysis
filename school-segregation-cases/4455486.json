I was with Arthur Young & Company, which I\n5    think is now Ernst & Young, one of the CPA firms for\n6    about seven years or so.    I was with Newpark\n7    Resources, which was a publicly held oil and gas\n8    company that was in New Orleans at that time.

And he's been in both\n17   residential and commercial since he was about 18 or 19\n18   years old.    So, he's primarily responsible for the\n19   field operations; the construction aspects of the\n20   business.    He also works with -- in our client\n21   development area.

We have been for about 15 years now involved\n10   in the self-storage industry.    It's a -- a lot of\n11   people are familiar with the multistory climate\n12   controlled storage facilities.     That is one of our\n13   main areas of operations, although we do other things\n14   within commercial construction.\n15       Q.    And are the -- the public storage buildings\n16   you're talking about, what kind of construction are\n17   those?\n18       A.    The primary component of most of those are\n19   metal buildings.\n20       Q.    And how many metal buildings has SBS built\n21   quantity, volume-wise, however you can distinguish it,\n22   over the last 20 years -- or 15 years?\n23       A.

Are you familiar -- were you involved in the\n6    hangar project at all?\n7        A.     I was primarily involved in the original\n8    negotiations of the contract, working with -- I think\n9    it was Neena Singh, who was one of the in-house\n10   attorneys for Lewis Energy.\n11       Q.     Okay.    And then, did you actually go out and\n12   do any of the construction?\n13       A.     No.\n14       Q.     Did you have oversight over the invoices and\n15   bills and stuff that was being paid as part of the\n16   project?\n17       A.     My accounting department, under Mr. Maywald's\n18   guidance, would -- that's their responsibility.       I\n19   would review the monthly applications for payment and\n20   then I would be the one who would normally sign them.\n21       Q.     Okay.    If you would, let's look at Exhibit\n22   Number 7.   I believe it's in the books right in front\n23   of you.    It's SBS Number 7.\n24                     THE COURT:   Mr. Clark, before we get\n25   started, I think that divorce just came in.       Let me do\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

What\n6    is Defendant's Exhibit Number 7?\n7        A.   It appears to be a recap of the monthly draws\n8    that were submitted on this project.\n9        Q.   And is that one of the SBS accounting\n10   documents?\n11       A.   Yes.\n12       Q.   Let's look at how we -- can you tell us -- go\n13   through -- let's just start with the very first entry\n14   on there, the Ace Concrete, and tell us, in looking at\n15   those columns, what the first column means that's\n16   highlighted at the top.\n17       A.   Well, it appears that one of the -- across\n18   the top it's the monthly draws, the dates for July,\n19   August, September through the last one; draw number 1\n20   through draw number 9.\n21       Q.   Okay.    And if you go straight down the\n22   column, what are the boxes down at the very bottom?\n23       A.   The box at the bottom is the payments that\n24   were received, the dates that they were received, and\n25   the check number that was on each check that came from\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

So, if we look at -- on Exhibit Number\n3    7, if we look at Ace Concrete, look in that very first\n4    column, the vertical column, the first draw was what\n5    date?\n6        A.   It was on the July draw.\n7        Q.   July 31st?\n8        A.   July 31st.\n9        Q.   And when was that draw paid?\n10       A.   September the 6th.\n11       Q.   Okay.   And so, that would have -- that draw\n12   would have included all the entries that are in that\n13   first column; right?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   Okay.   And then on draw number 2, there's\n16   another entry for Ace Concrete that's $99,000.00.     And\n17   when was that draw request?\n18       A.   The draw request is the end of the month,\n19   August 31st, and it was paid on October 22nd.\n20       Q.   Okay.   And how late was that payment,\n21   assuming 30 days?\n22       A.   It would have been due at the end of\n23   September, so 22 days.\n24       Q.   And then draw number 3 is dated what date?\n25       A.   September 30th.\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

And it includes how much for concrete?\n2         A.   16,000.\n3         Q.   And when was it paid?\n4         A.   January 17th.\n5         Q.   Were you made aware at any point between\n6    September 30th and January 17th that there was a\n7    problem getting that invoice paid for Ace Concrete?\n8         A.   No.   We had not gotten paid.\n9         Q.   Right.    And therefore, you hadn't paid Ace\n10   Concrete; right?\n11        A.   No, we had not.\n12        Q.   If you would, turn back to Exhibit Number 1.\n13   What is that document?\n14        A.   That is a standard AIA change order form.\n15        Q.   And is that your signature on Exhibit Number\n16   1?\n17        A.   Yes, it is.\n18        Q.   And this was submitted July 10th of 2012;\n19   right?\n20        A.   Yes, sir.\n21        Q.   Were you promised that it would be signed?\n22        A.   It was my understanding that it would be\n23   signed and returned to us.     Yes.\n24        Q.   Was it ever signed?\n25        A.   No.\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                         PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                              14\n\n\n\n\n1        Q.   Okay.   And we were sitting in court the other\n2    day -- yesterday and the question came out, is Tri-Bar\n3    seeking to avoid the change order because it wasn't\n4    signed; and the answer was no.      Was that the first\n5    time you'd ever heard that?\n6        A.   Yes, sir.\n7        Q.   Was it your understanding up until yesterday\n8    that Tri-Bar was saying that the change order was\n9    unsigned and we're not paying for it?\n10       A.   I had never received a return executed change\n11   order by Tri-Bar.\n12       Q.   Okay.   And if you would, look at -- and did\n13   that raise a concern for you?\n14       A.   Of course.\n15       Q.   Why?\n16       A.   You would expect that if you submitted a\n17   change order for work that had been discussed, the\n18   architect signed it, that the owner would be signing\n19   it as well and returning it.\n20       Q.   What would be a reason that the owner\n21   wouldn't sign it?\n22       A.   We were told that there was no problem with\n23   it and it would be signed.     And at times I was told\n24   that it had been signed, and had never been given a\n25   reason why it was not signed.\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

And so, what did you do to try to get it?\n2        A.   We -- we would take various steps.        I mean,\n3    normally, you have a project manager, so he would be\n4    inquiring with his contact.    And I would be getting\n5    feedback from those conversations.\n6        Q.   And so, for example, a standard practice\n7    might be, with respect to those weekly or daily job\n8    logs on issues -- you saw those when we were talking\n9    on Monday.    The issues noted on there, change order\n10   number 1, change order number 2 not signed.\n11       A.   It would be reflected on a daily report or if\n12   there were meetings between SBS and representatives\n13   with the owner or architects, engineers, whoever; it\n14   may be reflected in notes of that nature.       Maybe\n15   e-mails that would go back and forth when people were\n16   trying to update information.\n17       Q.   And did you -- did you request any -- what\n18   did you do when -- how long did it take you before you\n19   decided that the little subtle hints weren't --\n20   weren't working?\n21       A.   It would be hard to say an exact date.          I\n22   mean, what I would normally do is, we have a\n23   relationship with a new client here.        So, you're\n24   trying to get a feel for everyone -- different\n25   procedures.   Every client we work with is a little bit\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

We have clients that pay in five and ten\n2    days, and we have clients that pay in 30 and 35 days.\n3    It kind of depends on their internal procedure.         So,\n4    we would normally work through what I would call just\n5    polite channels of having various people talk to our\n6    contacts.    And then eventually, if it works up the\n7    line and it gets to my desk, then I will get in\n8    contact with the people that I knew worked with our\n9    respective clients.\n10       Q.     Okay.   Let me help you out with the timeline\n11   then.    Look at Exhibit Number 4.    And this is an\n12   e-mail from John Maywald to Tom Pittman, but it copies\n13   you, Steve Schiffman, and Jack Green.        And John\n14   Maywald works directly for you; right?\n15       A.     Yes, sir.\n16       Q.     And was this Exhibit Number 4 sent at your\n17   direction?\n18       A.     Yes.\n19       Q.     Why did you have John Maywald send this?\n20       A.     I mean, at first, it would be kind of a\n21   normal course where we have the accounting people\n22   call.    And since he's our leader of our accounting\n23   group, say, hey, can you help me out here and can you\n24   give me some updated information; following up on\n25   outstanding draws, change orders, or any other\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

And change orders still didn't come in and\n4    the payments still weren't made; right?\n5        A.    No, sir.    The change orders did not come in\n6    executed.\n7        Q.    Okay.   Look at Exhibit Number 5.\n8        A.    (Witness complying.)\n9        Q.    And I'll get you to look at the e-mail that\n10   starts at the bottom of the page and goes to page\n11   number 2.   This is an e-mail directly from you; right?\n12       A.    Yes.\n13       Q.    Okay.   And it begins with, \"Appreciate the\n14   opportunity to meet on Monday.\"       I'm just trying to\n15   give you a context of time.      Was there a meeting that\n16   you had with Mr. Pittman?\n17       A.    Yes.\n18       Q.    Can you describe how that meeting came about\n19   or why the meeting came about and how?\n20       A.    I had been having conversations with Mr.\n21   Pittman, if I refer to him as Tom, along the way just\n22   normal course of business following up on things.\n23       Q.    Is this on the phone?\n24       A.    Yes.\n25       Q.    Okay.\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

We decided after a\n2    period of time that it was best to get together on a\n3    -- try to get together on a regular basis.     So, we had\n4    started having some meetings over at Glacier Cap's\n5    office with representatives of SBS, Mr. Pittman, there\n6    was normally a representative from Mr. Grable's\n7    office, either John Grable or Matt Martinez, who would\n8    be present.\n9        Q.   And if you would, look at the second page\n10   where it says, \"Thanks for your efforts.\"    See that\n11   part at the top of the page?    \"Thanks for your efforts\n12   to get the checks and change orders in time for the\n13   meeting.\"   But he didn't have the checks by\n14   January 9th, did he?\n15       A.   No.   He said he was going to have them.\n16       Q.   Okay.   And then you asked a question, \"Would\n17   it be beneficial for me to contact anyone in your\n18   organization to see what is holding up payment and\n19   processing of the documents?\"   Why were you putting\n20   that in an e-mail?\n21       A.   Because I was trying to bring a higher level\n22   of concern to the situation.    And our relationship\n23   with many of our clients oftentimes the -- what I\n24   would refer to as the construction guys; the owner's\n25   construction manager, our project manager -- at a\n\n\n\n                        TAMI L.

So, I was\n6    trying to go, in essence, above Mr. Pittman and find\n7    out who else I could work with and get him out of the\n8    middle.\n9        Q.    Did you succeed in that?\n10       A.    No.\n11       Q.    Let's go back to Exhibit Number 7.   Do you\n12   recognize the amount in the bottom right-hand corner\n13   as the same amount that's on your mechanics lien;\n14   right?\n15       A.    426,560.88.   Yeah.\n16       Q.    Okay.   The payments that are -- the numbers\n17   that are referenced on Exhibit Number 7, what are\n18   those?\n19       A.    What are these numbers?\n20       Q.    Yeah.   What are they?   Are those numbers that\n21   you just -- are those payments that you made for\n22   invoices or for work that was performed?\n23       A.    Exhibit Number 7 is a recap?\n24       Q.

This is work\n5    that's been performed for which you're owed money?\n6        A.   Correct.\n7        Q.   Okay.    So, what are each of those numbers and\n8    what do they represent?\n9        A.   Well, if we go through the -- there's two\n10   main categories; subcontractor/supplier.       SBS\n11   subcontractor/supplier would be amounts that we have\n12   that would be distributed to the various parties that\n13   were providing services or materials.        And then the\n14   bottom part of it are items that would have gone\n15   through the general contractor that we would have paid\n16   for for items that were part of our overall contract\n17   on the project.\n18       Q.   All right.     So, this shows the total amount\n19   that's been billed and the total amount that's been\n20   paid and what's left outstanding; right?\n21       A.   Correct.\n22       Q.   And this is a cost plus contract?\n23       A.   Yes.\n24       Q.   So, what's on Exhibit Number 7 are the costs\n25   of SBS; right?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

Shortly after -- I guess less than a\n8    month after you had that meeting with Mr. Pittman, you\n9    know that SBS was terminated; right?\n10       A.   Yes.\n11       Q.

Okay.   And you know that -- and you were not\n10   at the meeting where SBS was terminated, were you?\n11         A.   No, I was not.\n12         Q.   Who was at that meeting; do you remember?\n13         A.   From SBS; that was Steve Schiffman, Jack\n14   Green, and Kyle Kieke, I think, were there\n15   representing us that week.\n16         Q.   Okay.   If you would, look at -- and you were\n17   informed right after the meeting that the termination\n18   had occurred; right?\n19         A.   Mr. Schiffman called me once the meeting was\n20   over.\n21         Q.   Okay.   If you would, turn to Exhibit Number\n22   11.\n23         A.   (Witness complying.)\n24         Q.   Okay.

And let's start with the e-mail.    \"Tom,\n3    please note the attached letter.\"    And then it's from\n4    you directly to Tom Pittman and it says what?\n5        A.   \"Tom, please note the attached letter.\n6    Please let me know if there's anything we can do\n7    during this transition.   Thanks for your assistance.\n8    Dave.\"\n9        Q.   At any point in time, did Mr. Pittman call\n10   you or e-mail you or write a letter to you between\n11   February 5th and now?\n12       A.   Not that I recall.\n13       Q.   Let's look at the letter.    If you would,\n14   let's read the first part of it.    It says, \"Steve and\n15   Jack informed me of the decision that was made.\"\n16       A.   \"Steve and Jack informed me last evening that\n17   the decision made by you and your representatives at\n18   Tri-Bar Ranch Company, Limited to complete the\n19   remaining scope of work at the Uvalde hangar site\n20   utilizing internal management personnel.    We are in\n21   the process of notifying each of the vendors,\n22   suppliers, and subcontractors of your decision.      We\n23   will issue each of them a notice to cease all work\n24   effective today, February 6th, 2013.\"\n25       Q.   Okay.

No, sir.\n3           Q.     Was it your understanding that they were\n4    simply electing to finish it in-house?\n5           A.     What I was told by Mr. Schiffman is that they\n6    decided to make a change.          And we were asked to\n7    cooperate as much as we could, and we said we would\n8    cooperate.\n9           Q.     Okay.   So, what did you request each of the\n10   subcontractors to do?          Read the next paragraph.\n11          A.     The next paragraph; you want me to read that,\n12   sir?\n13          Q.     Yes.\n14          A.     \"We will request each of them to submit a\n15   status report to Jack at the close of business today.\n16   And that they will coordinate transfer of any\n17   materials to you through an on-site verification\n18   process with Kyle.

Hold on.    Let me stop you there.   Did you get\n23   it done by Friday?\n24          A.     I don't think we heard back from all of the\n25   subs.

And we\n3    were originally asked to get everything done by\n4    Friday.   So, by the time we notified all the various\n5    subcontractors, some of them immediately got us\n6    information and some of them, I think, took until the\n7    next week.\n8        Q.    Okay.   And then you agreed -- just to short\n9    circuit things, you agreed to prepare the final\n10   invoices and submit the list of vendors, suppliers,\n11   and subcontractors; correct?\n12       A.    We agreed to do everything we were asked to\n13   do that was relayed to me from that meeting.\n14       Q.    And did you -- you got the list of\n15   subcontractors with names, addresses, and phone\n16   numbers, and contact information in a packet?\n17       A.    Yes.\n18       Q.    Was there originally some confusion about who\n19   the packet was sent to?\n20       A.    My understanding is that we gave -- I think\n21   John Maywald, after it was completed, gave the package\n22   to Jack Green, who said that he would deliver it over\n23   to Grable's office.   And I think he gave it to Matt\n24   Martinez.    And I think there's subsequently some\n25   confusion that it was -- it was at Mr. Grable's\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And let me ask you then.     If you would, look\n4    at Exhibit Number 12.\n5        A.   (Witness complying.)\n6        Q.   And this is a transmittal on February 15th.\n7    Was this something that was -- although it's got Mr.\n8    Schiffman's signature on it, is this something that\n9    you helped prepare?\n10       A.   Mr. Schiffman and I, at this point, were --\n11   we were business partners of a company.       So, we were\n12   working together on trying to wrap up this project.\n13       Q.   And some of the documents that are attached\n14   are documents from you and your department; right?\n15       A.   Excuse me?\n16       Q.   Some of the documents that are attached are\n17   from you and your department; right?\n18       A.   Let me look at them.     Yes, sir.\n19       Q.   Okay.    So, looking at the third page -- the\n20   second page behind the letter.     Isn't that the list of\n21   contractors with all of their -- subcontractors with\n22   all of their contact information?\n23       A.   The third page.    Yes, sir.\n24       Q.   Okay.

At this point in time -- and attached\n3    to that are the two draw requests that Mr. Cluck went\n4    over with Mr. Maywald; right?\n5        A.   Yes.\n6        Q.   One is for the remainder of work that had\n7    been executed to date, and the other is for a\n8    retainage; right?\n9        A.   Correct.\n10       Q.   Okay.   As of the 15th, had you provided all\n11   the information that you thought you were supposed to\n12   provide as had been requested?\n13       A.   To my knowledge, yes.\n14       Q.   Okay.   After February 15th, did you make any\n15   phone calls to Mr. Pittman to find out about -- well,\n16   what was your understanding about why you were getting\n17   all these payment invoices over there to them?\n18       A.   It was my understanding that Mr. Pittman had\n19   represented in that particular meeting that if we all\n20   cooperated in this matter, we could close this up as\n21   quickly and amicably as possible.      So, my objective at\n22   this time is to get payments for our subcontractors.\n23       Q.   Okay.   And so, did you call Mr. Pittman to\n24   see why it was now two weeks, three weeks after and\n25   you hadn't heard anything?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

I made a couple of phone calls to Mr.\n2    Pittman.    Yes.\n3        Q.     Did he ever answer any of your phone calls?\n4        A.     No, sir.\n5        Q.     Did he ever return any of your phone calls?\n6        A.     No, sir.\n7        Q.     All right.     If you would, look at Exhibit\n8    Number 14.\n9        A.     (Witness complying.)\n10       Q.     And do you recall receiving this letter from\n11   Mr. Grable?\n12       A.     I recall getting a copy of it.      I didn't -- I\n13   don't think I personally received it from Mr. Grable.\n14       Q.     Okay.   And you see the very first paragraph\n15   has to do with some administrative stuff; right?\n16       A.     Yes.\n17       Q.     Stuff that Mr. Grable thought he hadn't\n18   received?\n19       A.     I have to read it real quick.\n20       Q.     Particularly the last sentence.\n21       A.     \"We did receive your final draw application\n22   number 7 on February 6th, 2013.

And that's the list that we just looked at\n3    that was provided two weeks before that; right?\n4           A.   I'd have to look at the date, but I know it\n5    was provided before this letter was issued by Mr.\n6    Grable.\n7           Q.   Okay.   Another miscommunication; right?\n8           A.   Yeah.\n9           Q.   Okay.   If you would, skip the second\n10   paragraph and just go down to where it says, \"Jack,\n11   you may not be aware, but we have discovered several\n12   defects in work delivered by SBS.       Glacier Cap has\n13   hired an independent consultant to test and review all\n14   as-built conditions.      This effort continues and is\n15   still underway to complete a detailed list that\n16   outlines these defects and how they will be resolved.\"\n17   Did you ever see a list of defects?\n18          A.   Nothing was ever delivered to me.\n19          Q.   Did SBS ever receive one?\n20          A.   Not to my knowledge.\n21          Q.   \"Today it was determined that the building is\n22   a minimum of 2 inches out of plumb towards the west\n23   and that a number of the double-lock seam roof panels\n24   are not contiguous as specified.\"       Have you ever seen\n25   any measurements of the building provided by Mr.\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

Nothing to me.\n4        Q.   Any -- any photograph of a laser shot -- how\n5    easy is it to -- to document that a building is out of\n6    plumb?\n7        A.   I'm not a construction person, but I've been\n8    out to our project sites and the guys that work in the\n9    erection of metal buildings usually all have 4 and 6\n10   foot long levels that are used throughout the process,\n11   for beams and columns and things of that nature to\n12   check that they're level as they progress along.    So,\n13   it's not -- not that hard from what I would know.\n14       Q.   And it would be fairly easy to document,\n15   wouldn't it?\n16       A.   Yes, it would.\n17       Q.   And have you ever seen any documentation that\n18   shows that the building is out of plumb?\n19       A.   I have not.\n20       Q.   Okay.   Do you know if -- has any been\n21   provided to SBS?\n22       A.   Not that I'm aware of.\n23       Q.   Okay.   And the rest of that stuff has to do\n24   with construction stuff, and you're not a construction\n25   guy; right?\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Can I read the letter real quickly?\n6        Q.   Sure.\n7        A.   (Witness complying.)     I don't see anything\n8    referencing electrical work in this letter.\n9        Q.   Mr. Robertson had been terminated from the\n10   project a month before this, January 23rd; right?\n11       A.   Yes.\n12       Q.   And he was terminated at the express request\n13   of Tri-Bar; right?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   And you know, that issue was discussed at the\n16   office, wasn't it?\n17       A.   Yes.    As soon as Mr. Schiffman received the\n18   phone call from Mr. Pittman -- well, I don't remember\n19   if it was Jack may have received the first indication\n20   and it was discussed with Mr. Schiffman.    And then\n21   Steve and I discussed the matter once he received word\n22   of it.\n23       Q.   Okay.   You knew that it was going -- that you\n24   had a contract with Mr. Robertson; right -- SBS did?\n25       A.   Yes.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And you knew that you were going to be\n2    breaking that contract; right?\n3          A.   We had been told to break that contract.\n4          Q.   Right.   And why didn't you just stand up for\n5    Mr. Robertson at that point and say, no, we won't do\n6    it?   What would have happened to SBS?\n7          A.   It was -- it was a very awkward moment, to\n8    say the least, when you have a client call and tell\n9    you to terminate a sub.       It's not something that we\n10   had encountered.      We discussed it internally.   And I\n11   think the approach that -- that Steve took with Mr.\n12   Schiffman was to call Jerrod and to discuss with him\n13   what was going on and to hopefully try to come up with\n14   an amicable solution to a difficult situation.\n15         Q.   Okay.    Did you have other suppliers and\n16   vendors that needed to be paid as well?\n17         A.   Oh, yes.\n18         Q.   And you knew that Mr. Robertson needed to be\n19   paid 50-something thousand dollars; right?\n20         A.   Of course.\n21         Q.   If you had said, no, we're not going to do it\n22   and SBS had been terminated from the project at that\n23   point, would anybody have gotten paid?\n24         A.   No.   I think at that moment, after the\n25   termination, you're kind of in a situation where\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L.

Our\n5    objective was to work through it to get money to make\n6    sure all subs were paid.\n7        Q.   And at that point had you had any indication\n8    that Mr. Robertson was being terminated by Tri-Bar for\n9    quality reasons or anything to do with their work?\n10       A.   I did not.\n11       Q.   Okay.   So, did you have any reason to believe\n12   that you were not going to receive the $54,000.00 for\n13   Mr. Robertson?\n14       A.   I did not.\n15       Q.   So, in other words, by staying on the job,\n16   you felt like maybe you could get the $54,000.00 from\n17   Tri-Bar the next draw, pay Mr. Robertson, and at least\n18   you've --\n19       A.

This was going to be the next\n7    communication that anybody at SBS received from\n8    Tri-Bar; is that right?\n9        A.     I think so.\n10       Q.     And this is a letter that talks about the --\n11       A.     May I correct something?\n12       Q.     Yes.\n13       A.     I don't think we received communication from\n14   Tri-Bar.   I think we were getting letters from Mr.\n15   Grable.\n16       Q.     You're right.     You got nothing from Tri-Bar;\n17   right?    I got it.    And this complaint -- it doesn't\n18   answer any of -- it doesn't answer any of your\n19   inquiries, does it?\n20       A.     No, sir.\n21       Q.     This letter simply just brings up one other\n22   issue; right?\n23       A.     The first paragraph seems to address what\n24   appears to be another concern that's being placed on\n25   the table.\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L.

If you would, look briefly at\n2    Exhibit 17.\n3        A.   (Witness complying.)\n4        Q.   This is a letter from Mr. Schiffman.    Did Mr.\n5    Schiffman write this e-mail by himself?\n6        A.   He and I worked on it together, along with\n7    Mr. Green, as I recall.\n8        Q.   Okay.   So, this is a collaborative effort of\n9    everybody?\n10       A.   Yes.\n11       Q.   But as far as the construction issues that\n12   are in there, those are the issues that probably Mr.\n13   Schiffman should address?\n14       A.   Yes, sir.\n15       Q.   Okay.

Mr. Schiffman reviewed this with me right\n20   after he had received it from Mr. Pittman.\n21       Q.   And what it says is, \"Don't call us; call our\n22   attorney\"?\n23       A.

I\n9    called him a second time; left a message.     I think he\n10   called me back.   We had a brief conversation.\n11   Basically --\n12       Q.    Tell us about the conversation.\n13       A.    Basically, from my perspective, you know --\n14       Q.    I tell you what.

The voicemail that he left you, was it\n11   substantive or was it just --\n12       A.     No.    It was just, sorry I haven't gotten all\n13   the information I need yet, or something to\n14   thereabouts.      I'll be getting back with you.\n15       Q.     Okay.\n16       A.

Yes.\n14         Q.   -- as they came in over the summer after the\n15   lawsuit was filed.     What was the one thing that you\n16   kept asking me; where are these documents?     What was\n17   it?\n18         A.   Where were the documents?\n19         Q.   What document were you looking -- documents\n20   were you looking for specifically?\n21         A.   I was looking -- well, exactly what you're\n22   referring to.      But I was looking for documents on\n23   purported payments that were made to subcontractors,\n24   for other liens that may have been filed.     There was a\n25   variety of information that I was looking at from a\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

But on the -- you were still working with\n3    people in the industry; correct, like Schulte and\n4    whatnot?\n5        A.     Oh, yes.\n6        Q.     And you knew that several liens had either\n7    been filed or threatened to be filed; right?\n8        A.     Our relationship with some of our recurring\n9    vendors and suppliers -- they had informed me that\n10   they were filing liens.\n11       Q.     And did you try to find out from them if\n12   Tri-Bar was going behind you and paying off those\n13   liens?\n14       A.     I think I received the first phone call from\n15   one of our regular suppliers who told me that he had\n16   been paid.    We knew nothing about that.      And as a\n17   result of that, I think I inquired with some other of\n18   our regular subcontractors to see what was going on.\n19   Some of them said either we got paid or we're working\n20   on it.   Some of them said, I'm sorry; I've got some\n21   kind of a confidentiality agreement, I can't discuss\n22   anything with you.      I did not see any of those\n23   agreements.   I don't know what existed.       That's what I\n24   was told.\n25       Q.     Okay.   And if you'd been -- I mean, how long\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L.

All of them?\n4           Q.     Yeah, all of them.   About two months ago?\n5           A.     I was about to say, in the last couple of\n6    months before all the documents came through.        We had\n7    been given various indications that different people\n8    had been paid, but never got lists, never got final\n9    amounts.      I mean, to this day, we have the information\n10   provided through discovery.\n11          Q.     And that was provided just recently?\n12          A.     Yes.\n13          Q.     Even though it was the first thing we asked\n14   for?\n15          A.     I think that's why the -- 426 was always the\n16   number we were working with because it wasn't until\n17   later on that we started finding out that there was\n18   some payments made that we could actually verify.\n19          Q.     Yeah.   Confirming that payments had been\n20   made.       We suspected it, but couldn't confirm it.\n21          A.     Yeah.\n22          Q.     Okay.   So, the implication that was made to\n23   John Maywald the other day that SBS hasn't gone back\n24   and amended this lien affidavit.\n25          A.

And nobody has asked you to amend\n3    that lien amount to do something, have they?\n4        A.   No.    No one has asked me.\n5        Q.   Okay.    Knowing that some of the\n6    subcontractors have now been paid, if somebody did ask\n7    you to reduce the lien amount, you wouldn't have any\n8    problem signing a lien affidavit, would you?\n9        A.   I'd have no problem.     I'd call my attorney.\n10       Q.   In general, what was SBS's experience in\n11   working with Mr. Pittman and Mr. Grable?\n12       A.   My personal experience in working with them?\n13       Q.   Yes.\n14       A.   I admit I had meetings with Tom on a few\n15   occasions.   We had phone calls on a couple of\n16   occasions.   I guess I can only look back and say, he\n17   always seemed to say, we're going to do this.    We'll\n18   help you with that.   We'll get this done.   And then\n19   for various reasons that I don't know, the things that\n20   he and I were working on did not seem to ever get\n21   accomplished; whether it was checks, change orders,\n22   things of that nature.    I didn't have as much contact\n23   with Mr. Grable other than being in meetings that he\n24   was present at.\n25       Q.   Okay.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And in those meetings, he was more the -- you\n2    know, the architect who was focusing on designs and\n3    things of that nature and aesthetics than anything\n4    else.\n5        Q.     Okay.   But suffice it to say that this was an\n6    odd working relationship; right?\n7        A.     Oh, very -- very different from our typical\n8    client relationships.      I mean, I'm involved in just\n9    the business relationship with our clients and -- you\n10   know.    There appeared on this one, from my perspective\n11   looking into the operation side, more issues with\n12   communication, more issues with changes, more issues\n13   with redesigns, things of that nature than I had\n14   encountered on other projects.\n15       Q.     In 20 years of working with SBS, has SBS ever\n16   been sued or had to go to arbitration or even\n17   mediation regarding a claim like this?\n18       A.     No.\n19                    MR.

Mr. Morgan, yesterday when my client was\n3    testifying about the plan that he had, was it uncommon\n4    for Tri-Bar to just change plans with regard to this\n5    matter?\n6        A.    I -- I would not be involved in the technical\n7    drawings, plans, specifications, so I would not know\n8    if he would or wouldn't.     That could be kind of\n9    outside of my whole area.\n10       Q.    Okay.    But when my client -- you received\n11   information from Mr. Green that they wanted to\n12   terminate the Plaintiff, Robertson Electric?\n13       A.    How did I get that information?\n14       Q.    Yes.\n15       A.    I was first informed, as I recall, from Mr.\n16   Schiffman.\n17       Q.    And was that by phone or by e-mail or --\n18       A.    No.    We were in the office together that day,\n19   as I recall.\n20       Q.    And that was the same day as the e-mail or --\n21       A.    I think it was.    As soon as -- as soon as\n22   that was shifted to -- to Steve's desk, he immediately\n23   contacted me and we started conversing what we thought\n24   we should do.\n25       Q.    Did he give you a reason?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

The only reason I ever got in that -- as I\n2    recall in that moment was just, Mr. Pittman had made a\n3    phone call and/or contacted Jack or Kyle in some way\n4    and said that they wanted to make a change with the\n5    electrician.   I was not given any other reason.\n6        Q.     And you're not aware of any deficiencies or\n7    problems with Robertson Electric?\n8        A.     Not that I'm aware of.\n9        Q.     Now, with regard to paying -- that is for\n10   some work on this project -- I believe page 10,\n11   paragraph 8.07 of the contract -- and let me get that\n12   for you.\n13       A.     Okay.\n14       Q.     At 8.07 there's a section that says, \"Please\n15   take note.\"\n16       A.     Yes, sir.\n17       Q.     Would you read that, please?\n18       A.     \"Please take note, it does not matter how\n19   many witnesses hear the contractor make an alleged\n20   verbal agreement to pay for a change.       If there is no\n21   written change order in compliance with this section,\n22   subcontractor should not be entitled to any\n23   compensation for the change, addition, or revision.\"\n24       Q.     So, you heard Robertson's -- Jerrod\n25   Robertson's testimony regarding the revised plans that\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And with regard to that work, had you ever\n4    received any change order?\n5        A.     From Mr. Robertson?\n6        Q.     From --\n7        A.     Tri-Bar?\n8        Q.     -- Tri-Bar.\n9        A.     No.\n10       Q.     So --\n11       A.     No executed change order returned from\n12   Tri-Bar.\n13       Q.     So, it would appear that they wanted him to\n14   work with a real possibility of not paying him; would\n15   that be correct?\n16       A.     If he was asked to do something that was\n17   different from the plans without a change order, then\n18   there would be a risk to the subcontractor of not\n19   getting paid.\n20       Q.     Now -- we're now two days into this trial.\n21   And it appears to me, after I've listened to some of\n22   the testimony, there were many things that you guys\n23   attempted to do to accommodate Tri-Bar without the\n24   change order.

And here we are attempting to comply with the\n4    requirement that they do, and we're suing to get paid;\n5    right?\n6        A.   That's why we're all here.\n7        Q.   So, it appears to me a catch-22; you're\n8    damned if you do and you're damned if you don't;\n9    right?\n10       A.   I understand.\n11                MR.

SLATES:\n16       Q.   Mr. Morgan, on the point about Mr. Robertson,\n17   he was never asked to perform work that was subject of\n18   a change order, was he?\n19       A.   I would not know.    That would be the people\n20   directly working in the field.\n21       Q.   In fact, after his change order came in at\n22   $60,000.00 and Mr. Pittman got a bid from C&S for\n23   21,000, that's when Mr. Pittman asked you to make a\n24   change; not to ask him to perform the work?\n25       A.   I did not see that flow of information.      That\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Now, you said that you didn't know that the\n3    subs had been paid until the last couple of months.\n4    Are you sure that's accurate?\n5        A.     All the information -- well, like I said\n6    earlier to my -- as I recall, we had some subs that\n7    called us and told us they had been paid.    We had some\n8    that had indicated that they were working on it.      I do\n9    not know exactly when every document came.      But\n10   contemporaneous with the events chronologically, we\n11   were not given copies of checks as Tri-Bar issued\n12   them.    We got them through the discovery process.\n13       Q.     Isn't it true that you got copies of the lien\n14   releases in December of 2013?    And we can look at the\n15   documentation if you'd like.\n16       A.     There may have been some changes and lien\n17   releases.\n18       Q.     You don't dispute that, do you?\n19       A.     I'm just saying that there may be.    That's\n20   not an accounting document within our accounting\n21   system.    So, if someone files a -- if a subcontractor\n22   files a lien as a subcontractor, that doesn't change\n23   our accounting records.    If a subcontractor goes in\n24   and unfiles a lien, that doesn't change our accounting\n25   records.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Mr. Morgan, do you get lien releases in your\n2    business?\n3        A.     We do.\n4        Q.     You've seen lien release forms before?\n5        A.     Yes.\n6        Q.     And you know they typically say, in exchange\n7    for payment of \"X\" number of dollars, I release my\n8    lien?\n9        A.     I think there is a -- yes.    It's in that\n10   form.\n11       Q.     So, when you got those lien releases in\n12   December of 2013, you were seeing representations on\n13   sworn lien releases from your subcontractors saying\n14   they had received payment of \"X\" number of dollars;\n15   right?\n16       A.     Yes.\n17       Q.     All right.   So, the suggestion to this Court\n18   that you didn't know they had been paid until the last\n19   couple of months is really not true, is it?\n20       A.     I don't know when each of those lien releases\n21   came in.    But if they're dated, and I don't know when\n22   we received them afterwards.\n23       Q.     Well, you certainly knew -- without going\n24   into any of the substance of discussions at our\n25   mediation, but just using it as -- we mediated this\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

You're asking me, do I recall when mediation\n9    was?    No, I do not recall.\n10          Q.   (BY MR. SLATES)   I'll represent to you that\n11   mediation was in May of 2014.       If in fact, that's when\n12   it was, you knew at that time the subs had been paid,\n13   didn't you?\n14          A.   I do not recall, sir.\n15          Q.   All right.   You mentioned that you've never\n16   been involved in a lawsuit.      You had the opportunity\n17   yesterday when Mr. Lewis was here to talk to him some;\n18   is that right?\n19          A.   Did I say I was never involved in a lawsuit?\n20          Q.   I may be -- that may be overstating it.\n21          A.   Yeah.\n22          Q.

So, you've been in lawsuits; just\n6    not one like this?\n7           A.   Yes.\n8           Q.   My question is actually a little different.\n9    You had some conversations with Mr. Lewis yesterday;\n10   right -- Rod Lewis?\n11          A.   Mr. Lewis and I had what was purported\n12   between Mr. Lewis and I to be a private conversation.\n13   Yes.\n14          Q.   That's fine.    My question to you is, did he\n15   tell you that he's never been involved in a lawsuit\n16   with anyone that's ever built a project for him?\n17                      MR.

Do you know if it's millions and millions of\n3    dollars?\n4        A.     All I know is that he's a very successful\n5    businessman in the community who has a very large\n6    business.   And I would think that he has many more\n7    zeros behind his numbers than most of us.\n8        Q.     Now, there's been questions asked about when\n9    -- well, if you ever received a list of the defects\n10   and the costs that were being sought to be charged\n11   back.    You did get letters, or at least people at your\n12   company got letters where -- in fact, very early on.\n13   I believe the first one we saw was February 15th.      I\n14   think it's SBS Exhibit Number 14.     We don't need to\n15   pull it back up.   But in that letter, Mr. Grable says,\n16   hey, we're discovering defects and we're going to be\n17   offsetting whatever the cost of those defects are\n18   against your contract balance; right?\n19       A.     That's what I recall the letter says.\n20       Q.     And in fact, this lawsuit got filed -- I\n21   don't remember the exact date, but sometime in the --\n22   in the early summer of 2013; correct?\n23       A.     Whenever the date of it is.\n24       Q.     May of 2013; correct?\n25       A.     Whatever the date of it is.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And at that time, do you know if the project\n2    was finished?\n3        A.     I have no knowledge of what went on in the\n4    project side after we left.\n5        Q.     In fact, if the project wasn't finished in\n6    the -- it's difficult to know exactly what it's going\n7    to cost to complete the work on the project until you\n8    finish, isn't it?    Isn't that just an obvious\n9    statement?\n10       A.     I think that's for many reasons.\n11       Q.     But my point is, Mr. Morgan, that Tri-Bar\n12   wasn't in a position to tell you exactly how much they\n13   believed they were entitled to offset against your\n14   contract balance until after they finished the project\n15   and calculated the total amount.      And chronologically,\n16   that date fell after the lawsuit was filed; right?\n17       A.     I don't know when the project was finished.\n18       Q.     And isn't it true that you have received\n19   information in this lawsuit about what the defects are\n20   that are being claimed and the amounts that are being\n21   claimed?\n22       A.     Sure.   I think that's why we have a\n23   difference of opinion as to why we're here.\n24       Q.     So, to suggest that there was never -- that\n25   information was never provided to you, it was never\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

The letters were also after the termination\n5    meeting as well and not before.\n6        Q.   I assume you're familiar with the AIA\n7    contract?\n8        A.   That's one of the documents that we use.\n9        Q.   You use them on a number of projects.       This\n10   isn't the first time you've used them, is it?\n11       A.   Not the first, but it's not our first go-to\n12   document.\n13       Q.   Okay.   Are you familiar enough with them to\n14   -- I believe you signed the contract; right?\n15       A.   Yes.\n16       Q.   And I've looked on the certificate of\n17   authenticity on the -- because the AIA software\n18   requires someone to sign a certificate of authenticity\n19   and you signed that, too?   It's okay.     You are\n20   familiar --\n21       A.

Yes, that's it.\n7           A.   16?\n8           Q.   The last page of that exhibit.     Here you go,\n9    Mr. Morgan.       This may be a little faster.\n10          A.   Okay.    I signed this one, then I'll stand\n11   corrected.\n12          Q.   That means that you generated this document\n13   on your AIA software?\n14          A.   If we -- probably came out of our office,\n15   then I knew we were working back and forth with Neena\n16   Singh at that time.      Mr. Clark was assisting and\n17   trying to go through the changes that were being\n18   proposed.\n19          Q.   My question, though, is given that the\n20   document's certificate of authenticity is signed by\n21   you, that must mean that the document was\n22   generated out of your office.\n23          A.

And that remedy is in 9.7 of the A201?\n11       A.   Okay.\n12       Q.   Are you familiar with that provision?\n13       A.   Not off the top of my head.\n14       Q.   Okay.    This is it right here.     It's failure\n15   of payment.    Are you familiar with that provision?\n16       A.   I am not going to represent that I'm familiar\n17   with every provision within the AIA documents.\n18       Q.   Okay.    Take your time to read it.    I'm going\n19   to paraphrase it.    But basically what it says, if we\n20   don't pay you, you can stop work; right?\n21       A.   Uh-huh.\n22       Q.   You never did that, did you?\n23       A.   No.\n24       Q.

And again, we've got it up on the\n2    screen.    This is the provision we've looked at before\n3    in the trial that says -- I'm going to paraphrase it\n4    again -- that you have an obligation to enter into a\n5    subcontract to incorporate the terms of the general\n6    conditions.    Is that a fair paraphrase of that\n7    paragraph, in your opinion?\n8          A.   What it says.\n9          Q.   And did you attempt to do that in your\n10   contract with SBS?\n11         A.   Did we attempt to do that?    Oh, between SBS\n12   and Tri-Bar?\n13         Q.   I'm sorry.   Yeah.   That was a bad question.\n14         A.   Yeah.\n15         Q.   Did you --\n16         A.   It's all aright.     It's been long for all of\n17   us.\n18         Q.   Did you attempt to incorporate in your\n19   subcontract with Robertson a provision that would meet\n20   your obligation to Tri-Bar under section 5.3?\n21         A.   I'd have to go look at our exact subcontract\n22   agreement.    I'm sure that's something that you will be\n23   doing.\n24         Q.   Right where I'm headed.

No.   Which paragraph are you looking at?\n18       Q.    That's previously in the agreement.    Let me\n19   find the reference for you.

What it says.\n8          Q.   That was what you were binding Robertson to\n9    do?    You were binding Robertson to you just as you,\n10   SBS, were bound to Tri-Bar?\n11         A.   That's a legal representation.\n12         Q.   Do you have any reason to disagree with it\n13   based on your understanding of the agreement?\n14         A.   No.\n15         Q.   And if you, in your relationship with Tri-Bar\n16   -- Tri-Bar had the right to terminate you for\n17   convenience -- would you agree that, by incorporation,\n18   you had the right to terminate Robertson for\n19   convenience?\n20         A.   I wouldn't, but I'm not a lawyer.\n21         Q.

When Mr. Schiffman and I met after he was\n5    informed of the desire to -- or the demand from Mr.\n6    Pittman to terminate Robertson, we discussed\n7    contractual matters.    We made a business decision\n8    based upon the environment to contact Mr. Robertson\n9    and try to work out a business solution to a problem\n10   based upon representations that we were going to be\n11   paid --\n12       Q.    (BY MR. SLATES)   But my question --\n13       A.    -- to be paid.\n14       Q.    Sorry.   My question still remains, did you\n15   believe that you were breaching your contract with\n16   Robertson by telling him that the owner wanted to make\n17   a change?\n18       A.    I didn't even think of it at the moment, as I\n19   recall.\n20       Q.    If you believed it would have been a breach,\n21   would you have hesitated?\n22       A.    I didn't think of that at that moment.      Made\n23   a business decision.\n24       Q.

Didn't pull the contract out.       Didn't read it\n3    at that moment in time.\n4        Q.     And certainly, you heard Mr. Pittman's\n5    testimony; you're not here to controvert that and say\n6    that either of you or anyone else at SBS went to Mr.\n7    Pittman said, whoa, we can't do this; that's going to\n8    be a breach of our subcontract?      That didn't happen,\n9    did it?\n10       A.     I was not involved.    Mr. Schiffman had a\n11   phone conversation with Mr. Pittman.         I was not party\n12   to that conversation.      I don't know what they\n13   discussed.\n14       Q.     Let's look at Robertson 17, section 5.4.1.\n15       A.     (Witness complying.)\n16       Q.     There's been some testimony, frankly, that I\n17   didn't understand about this section is somehow\n18   relating to Robertson.     I want to make sure we get a\n19   clear understanding of what this section addresses.\n20       A.     I can only give you my understanding, and it\n21   may not be clear.\n22       Q.     That's fair.    This talks about the right of\n23   the owner to take an assignment of the contractor's\n24   subcontracts in the event of a termination for cause;\n25   right?    Is that right?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

What you're representing -- I mean --\n2        Q.   Well, let's just read it.    \"Each subcontract\n3    agreement for a portion of the work is assigned by the\n4    contractor to the owner provided that, one, assignment\n5    is effective only after termination of the contract by\n6    the owner for cause pursuant to section 14.2, and only\n7    for those subcontract agreements that the owner\n8    accepts by notifying the subcontractor and contractor\n9    in writing.\"   Did I read that correctly?\n10       A.   What it says.\n11       Q.   Is there any document that you're aware of\n12   where the owner or anyone else acting on behalf of the\n13   owner indicated that they intended to take an\n14   assignment of the Robertson subcontract?\n15       A.   I did not use the word assignment in any\n16   conversation that I was involved in.\n17       Q.   And certainly --\n18       A.   And I did not see a document that said we\n19   were an assignment.\n20       Q.   What -- what Mr. Pittman said is, I don't\n21   want to have anything to do with Robertson anymore.    I\n22   want a new subcontractor.   And I don't want to take\n23   over their subcontract.   Right?\n24       A.   I was not involved in the conversation with\n25   Mr. Pittman, so I don't know what he said.\n\n\n\n                        TAMI L.

Well, how much are you asking the Court to\n7    award you today in balance on the contract?\n8        A.     Oh, you're asking my opinion?\n9        Q.     I'm asking what your claim is in this\n10   lawsuit.   What are you suing my client for?\n11       A.     I -- I would have to look at a variety of\n12   documents here.    There's 305 and -- which is the 304,\n13   and then I think there's information relative to\n14   amounts related to work that wasn't performed and loss\n15   of profit, which I think are the two numbers at the\n16   bottom of this recap here.\n17       Q.     I'm going to get into that later.     Right now\n18   I'm just trying to figure out what SBS contends the\n19   contract balance is after the subs having been paid.\n20   Is that this number?\n21       A.     I think there was a number that says 305, and\n22   there's a difference of a couple hundred dollars\n23   between the two numbers.\n24       Q.     Okay.   I'm going to put 305.

All right.   So, your contract balance claim\n4    is about 305?\n5        A.     May I ask a question?\n6        Q.

I'm looking -- I'm looking at the document we\n7    were referring to earlier, Exhibit Number 7 in\n8    whatever book this is.\n9        Q.     That's SBS 7; right?\n10       A.     That has -- I think starting at 426 and the\n11   426 is the amount of the lien.      But there's also a\n12   document that then comes in and offsets the amounts\n13   that we've been told have been paid.\n14       Q.     Yeah.   And that's this one; right?\n15       A.     So, it's a different recap that I'm looking\n16   for that has that one.\n17       Q.     All right.   Well, I don't want to bog us down\n18   in this.   I didn't think it would be this complicated.\n19   I'm sure Mr. Clark will correct us if we're confused.\n20   But it's my understanding the contract balance claim\n21   is about $305,000.00.\n22       A.     It was 426, and then I think there was a\n23   hundred some-odd thousand of the amounts that were\n24   paid, and whatever that number nets to.\n25       Q.     About $120,000.00.

I have -- that's your representation.\n6        Q.     And the 305, that number includes the amount\n7    that you owe -- you put air quotes around owe -- to\n8    Superior Metal Services; right?\n9        A.     Yes.\n10       Q.

We already paid it.\n16       Q.     Well, you own SMS, don't you?\n17       A.     This is cash.   Cash we paid the bills for the\n18   erector.   We paid the bills out of our own cash flow\n19   for the installers.   We paid the materials for Schulte\n20   other than a small amount of money.     Intercompany-wise\n21   Superior is out that cash.    They have a receivable\n22   from SBS in that amount of money.\n23       Q.     But that's not what I asked you.

The -- the statement was made yesterday by\n7    Maywald that you don't charge a profit on SMS.     Can\n8    you explain to me?    I didn't really understand that.\n9        A.   We work in an area where metal buildings are\n10   a large part of the projects that we do.   Are you\n11   familiar with how metal buildings and erections and\n12   things of that nature are done?\n13       Q.   I am generally, but I don't know if the Court\n14   is; so if you want to explain that, go ahead.\n15       A.   Here is how we do it.    It may be different\n16   how you would do it.    There are metal building\n17   companies in the marketplace that package deals\n18   together in varying ways.   They -- you pay them a\n19   price, they have -- they get the materials, they might\n20   do some engineering, they do the installation, they\n21   package together, they have a company, they have an\n22   operation, they mark it up, they charge people.    Since\n23   it's a component of our work, we set up our own\n24   operation wherein we buy the materials, we arrange for\n25   the erector, we package that together at a cheaper\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

And then we manage that in-house.\n3        Q.     Okay.   But the statement was made yesterday,\n4    I think, that you don't charge a profit on SMS.\n5    That's not true, is it?\n6        A.     It varies from job to job.\n7        Q.     Well --\n8        A.     In this job we did not charge any profit\n9    because we used it as a manner to control costs.         The\n10   alternative is to go to a third party who charges\n11   more.\n12       Q.     The 8 percent fee that you charged on this\n13   project included the cost of SMS, didn't it?\n14       A.     The subcontractor -- it's a subcontractor --\n15   like the 8 percent fee on HVAC and the 8 percent fee\n16   on anybody else.\n17       Q.     But to the extent the Court was left with the\n18   perception that you didn't charge profit on SMS,\n19   that's not accurate relative to the amounts that you\n20   charged to Tri-Bar, is it?      You charged 8 percent on\n21   SMS's costs --\n22       A.     8 percent of all the costs.        That's a\n23   different question than does Superior Metal mark up\n24   its own amount and then it's marked up by the general\n25   contractor.

Which one?\n6        Q.   It's 7.8, related party transactions.    7.8.1\n7    defines a related party.    Certainly SMS and SBS are\n8    related parties under that definition; would you\n9    agree?\n10       A.   Yes.\n11       Q.   And 7.8.2 says if you're going to do business\n12   with a related party, you need to let the owner know\n13   and get their approval; right?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   And yesterday, I believe Mr. Green said that\n16   he told Mr. Grable that SMS and SBS were related.   But\n17   can you point to any communication or any\n18   documentation where that was communicated to the\n19   owner?\n20       A.   I can only give you my understanding of the\n21   chain of events that happened.\n22       Q.   And if I represent to you that the owner\n23   didn't know that you were affiliated until the\n24   mediation of this case, would that come as any\n25   surprise to you?\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

I think we learned that day and it was a\n2    surprise.    But it was my understanding that it had\n3    been discussed with Mr. Grable, Mr. Pittman, I cannot\n4    say that it was discussed with Mr. Lewis.\n5        Q.   All right.     In any event, if Mr. Grable is\n6    the only one that was advised of this, you did meet\n7    your obligation to give notice to the owner that you\n8    were doing business with a related party, did you?\n9        A.   There was no specific written notice given.\n10       Q.   And no verbal notice that you're aware of,\n11   other than Mr. Green's testimony yesterday about what\n12   he told --\n13       A.   It was my understanding that Mr. Pittman\n14   knew.\n15       Q.   Based on what?\n16       A.   Based on conversations that we had internally\n17   with Mr. Green, Mr. Schiffman, myself, and I met Matt\n18   Martinez.    And I think Mr. Grable said yesterday, and\n19   I did not hear anything, that one of the reasons they\n20   got us together was our metal building experience.\n21       Q.   Again --\n22       A.   That's how I recall.\n23       Q.   I'm sorry.     I didn't mean to interrupt you.\n24   7.8.1 and 7.8.2 don't talk about notice to the\n25   architect, do they?

If the owner is Mr. Lewis, I would not be\n3    aware if he did or did not know.\n4           Q.   All right.   Let's look at the termination for\n5    cause section of this agreement, section 14.2.      Oh,\n6    one more.     Before we -- before we go on to that, if we\n7    could pull up Tri-Bar 14.      And this document, I don't\n8    believe, has been admitted yet.       But can you take a\n9    look at it?\n10          A.   Is that in this white book?\n11          Q.   It appears on the screen.\n12          A.   It's sometimes easier for me to --\n13          Q.   Okay.   It appears in the subcontract\n14   agreement between Select Building Systems, SBS, and\n15   SMS.    Is that, in fact, what it is?\n16          A.   Yes.\n17          Q.   It lists a P.O. box for Select Management\n18   Systems.     Is that right?\n19          A.   Yes.\n20          Q.   Isn't it true that Select Management Systems'\n21   office is the exact same address as Select Building\n22   Systems?\n23          A.   Both SBS and SMS office out of our office in\n24   Boerne.

Okay.\n19       Q.   Now, Mr. Morgan, there's been a lot of talk\n20   in this case about the failure to provide notice prior\n21   to termination.    Do you recall that testimony?\n22       A.   Yes.\n23       Q.

I'd have to review the entire document and\n3    find something, so I don't know.\n4           Q.   Well, I'm asking you with respect to 14.2,\n5    that's right in front of you, if you can point me to\n6    anything that says you have the right to cure after\n7    receiving the notice or the right to do anything to\n8    avoid the termination after having received that\n9    notice.     I want you to tell me what it is.\n10          A.   As I recall, the notification provisions are\n11   required before you get to this point.        I'm not sure\n12   that --\n13          Q.   After giving the contractor a contractor\n14   surety, if any, seven days written notice.\n15          A.   Can you repeat the question again?\n16          Q.   Yeah.   I'm looking for the language that says\n17   you have a right to cure or have the right to do\n18   anything to avoid being terminated once you've\n19   received this notice.\n20          A.   Maybe requires notice.    What would the notice\n21   say?\n22          Q.   We're going to terminate you in seven days\n23   because you haven't complied with the contract.       Once\n24   you received that notice, there's nothing you can do\n25   to avoid it, is there, Mr. Morgan?\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

All right.    You -- you do understand the way\n3    that payment works in termination for cause?\n4        A.   Never experienced it before.\n5        Q.   All right.    Let's look at the language.\n6    14.2.3 says, \"When the owner terminates for cause, the\n7    contractor shall not be entitled to receive further\n8    payment until the work is finished.\"        Do you see that?\n9        A.   Which one?\n10       Q.   14.2.3.\n11       A.   Okay.\n12       Q.   And 14.2.4 then says, \"If the unpaid balance\n13   of the contract sum exceeds costs of finishing the\n14   work, including compensation for the architect's\n15   services and expenses made necessary thereby, and\n16   other damages incurred by the owner and not expressly\n17   waived, such excess shall be paid to the contractor.\"\n18       A.   That's what it reads.\n19       Q.   \"If the costs exceed the unpaid balance,\n20   contractor shall pay the difference to the owner.\"\n21   Right?\n22       A.   That's what it reads.\n23       Q.   So, when you terminate for cause, you don't\n24   get paid until the project is finished; right?\n25       A.   That's what it says.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And then only if there's excess balance?\n2        A.   That's what it says.\n3        Q.   And with a termination for convenience, if we\n4    can go to that section -- well, first of all, a\n5    termination for convenience can be for any reason;\n6    right?\n7        A.   I'm sure the document has specific reasons.\n8        Q.   All right.    Well, let's just focus on what\n9    happens in a termination for convenience.     14.4.3.\n10   \"In case of such termination for the owner's\n11   convenience, the contractor shall be entitled to\n12   receive payment for work executed and costs incurred\n13   by reason of such termination, along with reasonable\n14   overhead and profit on the work not executed.\"    Right?\n15   Is that correct?   Did I read it correctly?\n16       A.   Uh-huh.\n17       Q.   Is that a yes?\n18       A.   (Witness nodding head up and down.)\n19       Q.   Did SBS treat this termination as one for\n20   cause or convenience?\n21       A.   Convenience.\n22       Q.   Did you conduct yourself consistently with\n23   that testimony?\n24       A.

Let me give you some context.\n14   Let's look at SBS Exhibit Number 12.         Do you remember\n15   this one?   It was the submittal closeout\n16   documentation.\n17       A.    Okay.    The letter to Mr. Pittman?\n18       Q.    Okay.    We looked at it earlier this morning.\n19   You were submitting -- or Mr. Schiffman -- I don't\n20   remember who it was from, but I think you were copied\n21   -- were submitting closeout documentation.          Correct?\n22       A.    Yes.\n23       Q.    And there's two pay apps that are submitted\n24   there.   And we're going to look at those now.        And now\n25   let's go to Tri-Bar Exhibit Number 8.        We go down and\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

You're submitting for\n2    work in place as of date of termination; is that\n3    right?\n4        A.     I'm trying to get to the right book.\n5        Q.     Yeah.    Sorry.   I'm trying to move us along.\n6    I apologize if I'm rushing you.\n7        A.     No.    Okay.\n8        Q.     Are you ready?\n9        A.     Yeah.\n10       Q.     Schedule of values.    If you look at what's\n11   being billed for this period, I take it to mean that\n12   that's the value that SBS contends is the work in\n13   place or the cost of the work in place; is that right?\n14       A.     Work completed to this period?\n15       Q.     Yes, sir.\n16       A.     Okay.\n17       Q.     That's -- so, in other words, pay app number\n18   8 is your last bill on the project to close out the\n19   project.   That's what was said in the letter; right --\n20   or what you said in the letter?\n21       A.     Yes.    And I think there's a separate\n22   retention clause.\n23       Q.     Right.   I was just trying to draw the\n24   distinction between the value of work completed and\n25   retainage.   And we're going to go to the retainage\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

This is the value for work in place bill;\n2    right?\n3        A.     The total amounts.    Yes.\n4        Q.     Okay.    And if we look at Tri-Bar 9.\n5        A.     I'm sorry.    Same book?\n6        Q.     Yeah.    Just the next page.\n7        A.     Sorry.\n8        Q.     The next tab, rather.      This is the retainage.\n9    And we can see that, if we scroll down to the last --\n10   your billing for -- well, let me look at the schedule.\n11   Am I correct, without having to get stuck in the\n12   details, that this was a bill for retainage on the\n13   project?\n14       A.     Yes.\n15       Q.     Okay.    Let's look at whether or not you\n16   billed for the remaining profit on the job.        If we\n17   look at line item number 44 on that pay application.\n18   Do you see this line item here, contractor's fee?\n19       A.     Uh-huh.\n20       Q.     Yes?\n21       A.     Yes.\n22       Q.     Your total fee on the job is 90,820.\n23       A.     Yes.\n24       Q.     Total completed to date is 63,000; the\n25   balance to finish is 27,000; right?\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

So, you did not bill for your profit on your\n3    remaining work, did you?\n4        A.   We billed as to the cost to the date of\n5    termination.\n6        Q.   Yes.    But do you recall just a minute ago we\n7    looked at the termination for convenience provision.\n8    Now let's look at it again, 14.4.     And just to be --\n9    before we go back there, am I a hundred percent\n10   correct in saying you did not bill for profit on the\n11   remaining work?\n12       A.   No.    We just billed for the cost incurred to\n13   that date.\n14       Q.   All right.    Back to Robertson 17, section 14.\n15       A.   That's -- that's my understanding from\n16   looking at this here.\n17       Q.   \"In the case of termination for convenience,\n18   payment for the work executed\" -- that was 8 -- \"any\n19   costs incurred by reason of termination along with\n20   reasonable overhead and profit on the work not\n21   executed.\"   So, if you were going under this\n22   provision, you should have billed for the profit under\n23   remaining work; right, Mr. Morgan?     You weren't\n24   treating it as a convenience, were you?     You were\n25   treating it as a termination for cause.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

No.   I think our accounting department was\n2    following a cost-plus approach to accounting.\n3        Q.     Well, Mr. Morgan, if you were following the\n4    contract and getting paid what the contract said you\n5    could be paid in a termination for convenience, you\n6    would have billed for your profit under remaining\n7    work, wouldn't you?\n8        A.     I can tell you that I didn't even refer to\n9    that.    We did our accounting the way we always would,\n10   and that's all I can say.\n11       Q.     In fact, you knew it was a termination for\n12   cause.   You knew there had been problems on the\n13   project.    You knew that schedule had been a continuous\n14   issue.   And you knew that Mr. Pittman was trying to be\n15   a stand-up guy and get you paid, even though he was\n16   terminating you for cause, didn't you?\n17       A.     I did not know those things.\n18       Q.     Let's look back at the meeting minutes.\n19                    MR. SLATES:   Oh, I don't believe Exhibit\n20   Number 14 has been admitted yet.       We would move to\n21   admit that at this time.\n22                    THE COURT:    Any objections to 14?\n23                    MR.

I'm not certain that they're making a\n3    claim.    And so, that's my objection to it and was my\n4    objection then and it still is now.         It's a non-party.\n5    I'm not certain that there's a claim being made for it\n6    or collection for it.      And so, to that extent -- if\n7    it's just a document and there's no claim being made,\n8    then that's fine.      Other than that, I'm not clear of\n9    its relevance to this lawsuit.\n10                     THE COURT:   Okay.   Objection is\n11   overruled.   14 is admitted.\n12       Q.     (BY MR.

You said --\n16       A.     Am I in the same book here?\n17       Q.     Tri-Bar 48.    Yes, sir.    You said that you\n18   just heard yesterday that Tri-Bar was going to pay the\n19   change orders.      Is that your testimony?\n20       A.     I think Mr. Jones -- I think he said that\n21   yesterday.\n22       Q.     Didn't Mr. Pittman say it at the meeting?\n23   Mr. Pittman said that you've got -- we know you've got\n24   the change orders out there; we're going to get them\n25   paid.    Right?\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

I'm trying to find it, unless you can direct\n2    me.\n3          Q.   I'll try.    I'm sorry.    We've all seen this\n4    before.    I was just trying to move us along.\n5          A.   I don't remember -- memorize these things.\n6          Q.   Okay.    Down at the bottom, it says, \"Two\n7    outstanding draws and change orders not processed.\n8    Will get processed and paid.\"        Do you see that?\n9          A.   Okay.    It says that.    Yes.\n10         Q.   And then after the fact, Mr. Pittman\n11   discovers defects and sends you a letter and says,\n12   we're going to offset against the balance owed.\n13   Right?\n14         A.   I don't think Mr. Pittman sent any letters.\n15         Q.   You're correct.    Mr. Grable sent the letter.\n16   My apologies.      That happened, though; right?\n17         A.   Mr. Grable sent the letters subsequent to the\n18   termination meeting.      Yes.\n19         Q.   That number -- your 305 -- includes the\n20   change orders, doesn't it?\n21         A.   It includes the work that was accomplished;\n22   not the change orders because it's a cost-plus\n23   contract.\n24         Q.   Okay.    That's a fair clarification.

It includes the value of the work that\n2    was performed pursuant to the change orders?\n3        A.    Yes.\n4        Q.    So, in other words, that includes the amount\n5    that you're claiming on change orders?\n6        A.    For the work performed.    Yes.\n7        Q.    And if -- if Tri-Bar's offset claim is 318\n8    and they're only asking for $13,000.00 from you in\n9    this case, then they are acknowledging the change\n10   order to be valid, aren't they?\n11       A.    I don't know what your offset is or anything\n12   of that nature, so I can't make that leap.\n13       Q.    I want to look very briefly at the change\n14   orders.   SBS Exhibit Number 1.\n15       A.    I have that.\n16       Q.    Okay.   A change order can have a time\n17   component and a cost component to it; right?\n18       A.    Yes.\n19       Q.    And there's a space on the AIA form for both;\n20   right?\n21       A.    Yes.\n22       Q.    You filled out the change order, I take it?\n23       A.    No.\n24       Q.    Someone at your company did?\n25       A.    Yes.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And there is an amount associated with the\n2    change; it's 44,600.    Correct?\n3        A.   Yes.\n4        Q.   What did you all put in in terms of the time\n5    impact of the change?\n6        A.   Nothing was put in at that time.\n7        Q.   Zero; correct?    And it says, the date of\n8    substantial completion as of the date of this change\n9    order is, therefore, at 12/7/2012.\n10       A.   As of the date of that change order.      Yes.\n11       Q.   No impact to the schedule; correct?      That's\n12   the original date for completion, isn't it?\n13       A.   I think that's what it is in the contract.\n14       Q.   Let's look at Exhibit 2 SBS.       Again, a cost\n15   change of 27,000, but no time change; right?\n16       A.   None listed.\n17       Q.   Zero.    And the same substantial completion --\n18   or final completion date, rather?\n19       A.   That's what's listed.\n20       Q.   Change order number 3.     This is actually the\n21   day after you're terminated, isn't it?\n22       A.   February 6th.    I think that was the wrap-up\n23   -- the accounting change order.\n24       Q.   Right.   We're going to capture everything\n25   that hadn't been captured yet.     $19,000.00?\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

So, those first two change orders -- one of\n3    them was for 44,000, I believe, in July.       One of them\n4    was for -- 44,600 was the first one.        27,544 was the\n5    second one.    And 19,786 is this one.      Correct?   Total\n6    change orders of about $90,000.00?\n7        A.   If that's the way they add up.\n8        Q.   So, for all of this talk about the constant\n9    changes on this job, in fact, that you couldn't come\n10   or go from all the misinformation and information that\n11   you were getting about what you should build and what\n12   you shouldn't build and how many changes you were\n13   making -- at the end of the day when you were\n14   terminated, what you asked for was a total of\n15   $90,000.00 in changes on a $1.2 million job?\n16       A.   If that's what it adds up to.        You're saying\n17   the three change orders add up to 90,000?\n18       Q.   That's a round number.\n19       A.   Okay.\n20       Q.   You didn't ask for any time extensions on\n21   this change either, did you?\n22       A.   No.    Is there a section in this contract that\n23   has liquidated damages for delays?\n24       Q.   I'm sure if Mr. Clark thinks that's\n25   important, he'll ask you about it.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Mr. Morgan, in your experience in the\n3    industry, do you understand there to be a difference\n4    between claims for breach of warranty and a claim for\n5    breach of contract.\n6        A.   I've never encountered this.        I wouldn't say\n7    that I'm aware of it.\n8        Q.   Are you aware of any legal obligation to\n9    provide notice and opportunity for a cure before you\n10   make a claim against a contractor for breach of\n11   contract?\n12       A.   Am I aware of what, sir?\n13       Q.   Any legal obligation to provide notice to a\n14   contractor before you make a claim for them -- against\n15   them for breach of contract?\n16       A.   I'm only aware of what's in these documents.\n17       Q.   Let's assume that the Court doesn't agree\n18   with the offset claim and only agrees to a part of the\n19   offset claim, and that when you do the math, money is\n20   owed to you.    I want to look at the interest provision\n21   in your contract.    Let's look at Robertson Exhibit 15,\n22   section 15.2.\n23       A.   Robertson which one?\n24       Q.

The interest rate that you contractually\n2    agreed to is 1 percent per annum; am I correct?\n3        A.   If that's what the contract says.\n4        Q.   And you signed the contract?\n5        A.   Yes, I did.\n6        Q.   Let's look at SBS 55.     And first, let's\n7    establish that Mr. Morgan received a copy of this.      I\n8    believe he did.   That's your e-mail address, isn't it,\n9    Mr. Morgan?\n10       A.   Yes.\n11       Q.   And I want you to take your time to read this\n12   letter, though you've seen it before.       It's a letter\n13   where Mr. Schiffman is addressing the concerns that\n14   have been raised by Mr. Grable about the fact that\n15   there's been some field modifications to the wind\n16   bents on the project.    Do you recall that?\n17       A.   I'm aware of the issue, but I have no idea\n18   where the wind bents are.\n19       Q.   Okay.    What Mr. Schiffman says is, \"The two\n20   field modifications that have been reflected upon with\n21   a misalignment of bolt holes marrying the wind bents\n22   to the taped column and the flange on the wind bent\n23   being modified to fit inside the taped column flange\n24   where they marry.\"   Do you see that?\n25       A.   Yes.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                        PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                                88\n\n\n\n\n1        Q.    Do you see anywhere in that letter where it\n2    refers to a discussion of field modification of the\n3    building itself so that it would fit the hangar doors?\n4        A.    I'd have to read the whole letter.\n5        Q.    I'll represent to you that there's none in\n6    there.   If you find one, let me know.\n7        A.    Okay.\n8        Q.    If we go down a little further, what\n9    commitment is Mr. Schiffman making to the owner in\n10   conjunction with field modifications?      He says, \"The\n11   SBS team will wait for Schulte's field assessment and\n12   consult with the owner's representatives in regards to\n13   any corrective action process recommended by the\n14   structural engineer and proceed from that point.\"     And\n15   here is the important part.   \"SBS will continue the\n16   erection process, but will not proceed with any future\n17   erection discrepancy without giving the owner\n18   representative notice to assess and respond with\n19   direction.\"   Do you see that?\n20       A.    Yes, sir.\n21       Q.    That was a personal commitment from Mr.\n22   Schiffman and SBS not to do any further field\n23   modifications without notifying the owner and getting\n24   approval, wasn't it?\n25       A.

And that's what he said; right?\n3        A.     What he said.\n4        Q.     And we heard Mr. Green yesterday say that he\n5    wasn't aware of any notice that went to the owner.\n6    Are you aware of any notice that went to the owner\n7    before those -- that building was field modified to\n8    make it fit on the foundation?\n9        A.     I am not aware.\n10       Q.     We went over this with Mr. Green yesterday,\n11   so I'm not going to belabor the point.      But you saw in\n12   the contract where it's the contractor's\n13   responsibility to review the shop drawings for any\n14   inconsistencies; right?\n15       A.     That's what it said.\n16       Q.     And what it says is, if you find an\n17   inconsistency, you're suppose to report it to the\n18   owner.   Do you remember that?\n19       A.     I remember that being discussed.\n20       Q.     Have you seen anything that indicates that\n21   that inconsistency in the size of the building to the\n22   size of the foundation was reported to the owner?\n23       A.     I wouldn't see every correspondence involving\n24   the field operation, but I did not see it.\n25       Q.     All right.   We know Mr. Green said that he\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

We heard Mr. Grable deny that that conversation\n4    ever existed.        And I think we're going to hear from\n5    Mr. Victor de Anda later today and we'll see what he\n6    says.       But if, in fact, both Mr. Grable and Mr. de\n7    Anda say that never happened, are you aware of any\n8    other facts that would suggest that SBS brought the\n9    inconsistency in the brick lug and the structural\n10   drawings to the owner's attention?\n11          A.     I would not have been involved in any of\n12   those discussions.\n13          Q.     Let's go to Tri-Bar 48, second page.\n14          A.     Give me a second, sir.\n15          Q.     I'm sorry.\n16          A.     This process is cumbersome, at best.\n17          Q.     This is the meeting minutes from the\n18   termination February 5th; correct?\n19          A.     Yes.\n20          Q.     And this is Mr. Schiffman talking.    He says,\n21   \"We are upfront forthright people.\"         He's referring to\n22   SBS; right?\n23          A.     I would assume that.\n24          Q.     Is it a true statement?    Is SBS upfront\n25   forthright people?\n\n\n\n                             TAMI L.

I can't comment as to what the owner may or\n7    may not feel.\n8        Q.   Can you see where the owner might feel that\n9    you weren't upfront and forthright when you modified\n10   the brick lug in the field without telling them?\n11       A.   I don't know what the owner felt.\n12       Q.   Can you see where the owner might feel that\n13   you weren't upfront and forthright when you didn't\n14   tell them that you owned SMS, the building erector?\n15       A.

Yes.\n6        Q.   Okay.   And there's no profit on it; it's\n7    booked through at cost; correct?\n8        A.   Correct.\n9        Q.   In other words, SBS didn't charge a profit\n10   like a third party company would; right?\n11       A.   SMS.\n12       Q.   SMS did not charge a profit like a third\n13   party company would?\n14       A.   Correct.\n15       Q.   There's only one profit that's billed and the\n16   profit that is paid by SBS is the same no matter what;\n17   right?\n18       A.   Correct.\n19       Q.   Okay.   And just so we're clear, SBS and SMS,\n20   it's one accounting department; right?\n21       A.   One accounting department.\n22       Q.   All right.     If you would, turn back to --\n23   turn back, I guess, two pages in that contract.\n24       A.   Okay.\n25       Q.   Just above where it says, article 5, contract\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

Yes.\n4        Q.   And there's a little thing that says,\n5    \"Certain provisions for liquidated damages relating to\n6    failure to achieve substantial completion on time.\"\n7    Did I read that part?\n8        A.   Correct.\n9        Q.   And what did you guys agree to?\n10       A.   None.\n11       Q.   And why is that significant to you?\n12       A.   If you have a contract that has liquidated\n13   damages from a contracting administration standpoint,\n14   you're obviously sensitive about days; so, therefore,\n15   you count days and reasons for delays along the way.\n16   If you are not sensitive to that, then we typically do\n17   not account for that within our change orders and\n18   things of that nature.     Because we're not -- we're not\n19   counting days.   We're not asking for it.    It's not a\n20   factor in processing the accounting documents.\n21       Q.   Okay.   So, that would not -- and the\n22   accounting documents that you were talking about\n23   earlier when Mr. Slates was talking about days and\n24   whatnot and changing the contract time, you from an\n25   accounting perspective were not worried about that?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

Now, on the project side, you're certainly\n3    trying to keep to a schedule; right?\n4        A.   Yes.\n5        Q.   But that's somebody else's department?\n6        A.   That's outside what we do from the accounting\n7    side.\n8        Q.   Different set of documents.        Okay.   Mr.\n9    Slates had you go through and try to read and get your\n10   understanding about the AIA contracts and general\n11   conditions.    Is that something that you do as -- is\n12   that something that you do when you have a question\n13   about what those documents mean?\n14       A.   As a businessman, I have a working knowledge.\n15   If I have a detailed question, I would call my\n16   attorney.\n17       Q.   And who do you call?\n18       A.   Mr. Tom Clark.\n19       Q.

What -- what aspect -- or what are\n8    Dave's responsibilities and what are your\n9    responsibilities, as far as SBS is concerned?\n10       A.     I'm responsible for the overall development\n11   and management of the company, and Dave is responsible\n12   for all the daily operations.\n13       Q.     Okay.   Would it be more fair -- or would it\n14   be fair to say that you're responsible for the project\n15   operations, and Dave is responsible for the accounting\n16   and business operations?\n17       A.     Correct.\n18       Q.     Okay.   Now, did you ever have an opportunity\n19   to -- I want you to focus on this project for a\n20   second.

Before February the 5th, had Mr.\n2    Pittman ever said anything to you that indicated that\n3    the owner was so upset with you that SBS should expect\n4    to be terminated, at any time?\n5        A.   Not -- not at all.     No.\n6        Q.   Okay.   Had Mr. Grable ever told you or made\n7    any comment to you that it led you to believe that SBS\n8    was going to be terminated on the job site?\n9        A.   No mention of termination was ever discussed.\n10       Q.   Now, when you -- you had -- you had had a\n11   chance to discuss these issues regarding the delay of\n12   the Schulte and other -- other project delays with Mr.\n13   Grable or Mr. Pittman?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   And did they ever tell you that if this\n16   continues, SBS is going to be terminated?\n17       A.   No, sir.\n18       Q.   Okay.   Now, originally this contract called\n19   for the project to take 173 days.\n20       A.   That is correct.\n21       Q.   Okay.   At the time you drew up the contract,\n22   did you think that this job could be done in 173 days?\n23       A.   At the time the contract was drawn -- I\n24   didn't draw the contract -- that's the number of days\n25   that we thought we could complete the set of plans\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

Did you ever -- to your knowledge, did\n6    SBS or Schulte or any supplier have to wait on\n7    decisions to be made from the architect, Mr. Grable,\n8    or the structural engineer, or Mr. Pittman?\n9        A.     The changes that were made were -- were sent\n10   directly to Schulte, and then there was times when\n11   they needed to be addressed.\n12       Q.     Okay.   Are we talking about on the building\n13   dimensions?\n14       A.     No.\n15       Q.     Okay.

Was it poured according to the structural\n21   plans or the building plans?\n22       A.     The foundation was poured prior to the\n23   building plans -- the actual shop drawings being\n24   complete.    And it was poured according to the\n25   architectural plans.\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L.

In this case there has been some testimony\n17   that Mr. Key told -- or sent a set of shop drawings to\n18   Mr. Grable disclosing the discrepancy between the\n19   foundation and the shop drawings.

I'm aware that the shop drawings were sent\n3    from Schulte Building Systems to, I think, the\n4    architect's office with denotations and questions\n5    about dimensions.\n6    BY MR. CLUCK:\n7        Q.   Okay.    Did those plans ever -- were they ever\n8    sent directly to SBS for SBS to take a look at, as far\n9    as you know?\n10       A.   SBS got them after the fact from Schulte.\n11       Q.   Okay.    But that was after -- or was that\n12   after John Grable had already signed off on them and\n13   sent them back to Schulte?\n14       A.   John Grable and the structural engineer both\n15   signed off on them.\n16       Q.   Okay.    So, was it your understanding that the\n17   owner was already aware of the discrepancy, as far as\n18   your understanding?\n19                   MR.

Now, in the meeting -- I want you to\n8    go back to the meeting minutes on Exhibit 40-A.    Let\n9    me ask you, when you walked into this meeting -- I\n10   think you testified a minute ago you had no idea that\n11   you were about ready to get fired; is that right?\n12       A.   Right.\n13       Q.   Tell us how that meeting went, from your\n14   perspective.\n15       A.   Well, we all sat down in the room and they\n16   sent a person in to -- with a laptop computer to do\n17   something.   I didn't know what they were going to do\n18   at the time, but it was rather unusual.     And then Tom\n19   Pittman was not there.    He came in last -- well, he\n20   came in last and then a gentleman named Tony -- I\n21   don't remember his last name -- came in in the middle\n22   of the meeting later.    So, Tom was not actually last.\n23   But Tom came in, sat down, and basically said right\n24   off the bat, \"Rod wants to make a change.\"\n25       Q.   Okay.    Did you take that as -- I mean, let me\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

When Mr. Pittman made that statement, did he\n2    say, you know, we've repeated problems on here; you've\n3    refused to do things, you've never done this; you've\n4    never done that; you repeatedly do this or don't do\n5    that?       Did he ever say those kind of things to you?\n6           A.     No, sir.\n7           Q.     He said that Rod wants to make a change?\n8           A.     Yes.\n9           Q.     Sounds like -- would that be something like\n10   termination for convenience?\n11          A.     Yes, sir.\n12          Q.     Okay.   And how did that strike you?\n13          A.     Well, you know, you walk into a meeting like\n14   that and you're not expecting something and you've\n15   never really been in that situation before.          And the\n16   number of years I've been in construction, it kind of\n17   set me back and -- and basically -- I guess we stated\n18   some cordialities after that and we exchanged -- just\n19   kind of looking for words.\n20          Q.     Now, did Mr. Pittman tell you, look, Rod\n21   wants to make this break as amicable as possible?\n22          A.     Yes.    And I took him as being sincere.\n23          Q.     Okay.   And then -- now, the minutes say that\n24   you said, \"We're disappointed.           We understand part of\n25   it.\"    What did you mean?\n\n\n\n                               TAMI L.

Well, I don't think that -- that -- the job\n2    itself wasn't a job where you're given a set of plans\n3    and you just went out and built a project from a set\n4    of plans.   It was constantly being redesigned.   And --\n5    which always causes some difficulties.\n6        Q.   And you say you understood part of it.    What\n7    is it that you meant when you say you understood part\n8    -- if you said that?\n9        A.   Well, because the job was constantly under\n10   redesign and there were always things that needed to\n11   be addressed, it wasn't really cohesive.    So, I guess\n12   I -- that's what I meant.\n13       Q.   There wasn't a constant flow?\n14       A.   Right.\n15       Q.   Project flow?\n16       A.   Right.\n17       Q.   Okay.    So, the project was a stop, start,\n18   stop, start type project?\n19       A.   Well, it was a surprise every day.\n20       Q.   Now, once you were told that you'd been\n21   terminated because Rod wanted to make a change for his\n22   convenience, did you ask what can we do to get back --\n23   you know, get back on the job?\n24       A.   Yeah.    I asked if there was some type of -- I\n25   forgot the word I used, but it's in here somewhere.     I\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And what were you told?\n3        A.   If there was an appeal process.\n4        Q.   I'm sorry.     What were you told?\n5        A.   No.    Rod has made the decision.\n6        Q.   So, by the time this -- this meeting\n7    occurred, Rod had already made a decision to terminate\n8    you guys, even though you'd never been told of any,\n9    quote, repeated refusals to do the work?\n10       A.   If they told us anything, we would do it.\n11       Q.   And you were told that this was a done deal\n12   and there was no appeal; correct?\n13       A.   Yes, sir.\n14       Q.   Okay.    No one you could talk to?\n15       A.   No, sir.\n16       Q.   Okay.    But they wanted to make it as\n17   applicable as possible; right?\n18       A.   Yes.    They made it sound like, you know, we\n19   were going to work together to work this out.      And\n20   there wouldn't be any -- what I drew from it is there\n21   wouldn't be any problems getting paid.\n22       Q.   Okay.    Now, there's a comment here that says\n23   -- says that -- from Mr. Pittman, \"We're terminating\n24   and that we're going to be fair.

Says, \"Tom says to continue with the meeting\n8    is moot.\"\n9           A.    Correct.\n10          Q.    Do you remember that?\n11          A.    (Witness nodding head up and down.)\n12          Q.    So, it was like, you're done, you're over,\n13   we'll see about getting you paid, we'll get you paid.\n14   But to continue any further is -- that's off.         Was\n15   that your understanding?\n16          A.    Yes, sir.\n17          Q.    Okay.   And then -- now, you made a comment\n18   that you said that you felt that you were upfront\n19   forthright people.        And you know that there were some\n20   problems and you're sorry about it.          Can you explain\n21   to the Court what you meant, if that's what you said?\n22   It's on page 2 of Exhibit 48.\n23          A.    Yes.    I'm reading it.

So -- and then again, Tom tells you, \"Rod\n4    wants to make a change, and so we're going to make a\n5    change.\"    Is that what he says in there, right below\n6    there?   Is that the way you remember it?\n7        A.     Yes.\n8        Q.     Okay.\n9        A.     That's correct.\n10       Q.     Now, then Tom makes some comment about,\n11   \"Well, contractually we don't have to pay until the\n12   project is finished and we're not going to do that.\"\n13   Is that what he said?\n14       A.     Correct.\n15       Q.     Okay.   So, he represented, we're going to\n16   terminate you.     It's a done deal.     We're going to get\n17   you paid.   We could take a position, but we're not\n18   going to take a position.       Okay.   Did he ever say\n19   that, hey, we're not -- we don't have to pay you\n20   because we're terminating you for cause?       He never\n21   said that, did he?\n22       A.

Well, if the contract said that if you\n16   weren't paid, you could cease work, would that be an\n17   option that you would have?\n18       A.   Yes.\n19       Q.   Okay.    But you didn't cease work when you\n20   didn't get paid, did you?\n21       A.   No.    We didn't cease work when we didn't get\n22   paid and we didn't cease work when the change orders\n23   were never signed.\n24       Q.   Right.    If the contract -- if the AIA\n25   contract says you don't have to do any more work until\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n3        Q.    Generally?\n4        A.    Well, we wouldn't proceed with the change\n5    orders.   But in order to do anything, we had to.\n6        Q.    Right.\n7        A.    We couldn't even order the metal building\n8    without -- with a change order.\n9        Q.    Now, let me ask you -- so, SBS relied on what\n10   the owner's representative, Mr. Pittman, promised in\n11   terms of payment; correct?\n12       A.    Yes, sir.\n13       Q.    And that had been an ongoing course of\n14   dealing; correct?\n15       A.    Correct.\n16       Q.    As a matter of fact, you had come to continue\n17   to do work based upon Mr. Pittman's representations?\n18       A.    Yes.\n19       Q.    As the owner's representative?\n20       A.    Yes.\n21       Q.    Okay.    Now, have you ever become aware that\n22   in this case Mr. Lewis issued a no-pay edict way back\n23   in October?\n24       A.    I know today, but I did not know then.\n25       Q.    Right.   So, after that no-pay edict came down\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

No.\n4        Q.     He never revealed that little secret to you?\n5        A.     No, sir.\n6        Q.     Okay.    And as a matter of fact, he didn't pay\n7    -- you can look up here at this list, just like the\n8    Court can, and see and how many times the payments\n9    were late or not made at all; correct?\n10       A.     Uh-huh.\n11       Q.     But despite these representations and -- or\n12   based upon the representations and the promises that\n13   they were going to happen, SBS continued?\n14       A.     Yes.\n15       Q.     And you relied on them -- SBS relied on them?\n16       A.     Yes, sir.\n17       Q.     Okay.    And now SBS hadn't gotten paid,\n18   according to the promises?\n19       A.     Correct.\n20       Q.     Right?    Now, Mr. Pittman knew that he had\n21   gotten a no-pay edict from Mr. Lewis back in October;\n22   right?   I mean, assume with me the testimony is that\n23   Mr. Lewis gave a no-pay edict to Mr. Pittman back in\n24   October.\n25       A.     I know that now.     Yes.\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L.

Did Mr. Pittman personally -- tell you\n2    personally that he was going to make sure you got paid\n3    and the change orders were going to be signed after\n4    that statement was made in October?\n5        A.   Yes.\n6        Q.   Okay.   And so, you would continue to rely on\n7    statements or representations that Mr. Pittman made on\n8    behalf of the owner, even though Mr. Pittman knew that\n9    that was absolutely false?\n10       A.   I know that now.\n11       Q.   And if you had known that Mr. Lewis wasn't\n12   going to pay you, would that have impacted whether or\n13   not SBS would have continued to do the work and supply\n14   labor and materials and continue on the job site?\n15       A.   Yes, sir.\n16       Q.   Might have stopped it right there; right?\n17       A.   Yes, sir.\n18       Q.   Until you got it worked out?\n19       A.   Yes, sir.\n20       Q.   Now, let me ask you, are you now aware that\n21   the building's roof had to be removed?\n22       A.   Yes.    I've been told that.\n23       Q.   Okay.   And let me back up.    You visited the\n24   job site, didn't you?\n25       A.   Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

And are you aware of any reason why\n2    the roof -- the entire roof of this structure would\n3    have to be removed?\n4        A.     I don't know why they removed the roof.    No.\n5        Q.     Even if you had to maybe move a column a\n6    small amount to re-plumb it, would that require the\n7    entire roof to be removed?\n8        A.     No, sir.    I think that they had to pair two\n9    panels on the roof to make it match them.      So, that's\n10   why they removed the roof, is my opinion.\n11       Q.     Now, if you were going to -- let's assume\n12   that there were two panels on the end of the building\n13   toward the river of where this project is located.\n14   Okay.    And if -- and if that column had to be -- was\n15   out of plumb, how would you, based on your experience,\n16   fix it?\n17       A.     If the column was out of plumb, we would\n18   loosen the adhesion of the base and we would slide the\n19   column over and then reweld it or bolt it or adhere it\n20   in some method approved by the structural engineer.\n21       Q.     Okay.   Well, number one, did anybody ever\n22   tell you that the building that was constructed was\n23   out of plumb?\n24       A.     No, sir.\n25       Q.     Okay.

No.\n4        Q.   Okay.   So, would you have had to remove the\n5    roof just to move that -- the base of those columns\n6    over like you were just talking about?\n7        A.   No, sir.\n8        Q.   Okay.   Would you think that changing that\n9    roof would -- or removing the roof would be an\n10   unreasonable expense?\n11       A.   I'm sorry.     I didn't hear you.\n12       Q.   Do you think that removing the roof to plumb\n13   two columns would be an unreasonable expense?\n14       A.   In my opinion, yes.\n15       Q.   Yeah.   In your opinion.     Based on at least\n16   15 years in the pre-engineered metal building\n17   business?\n18       A.   Yes.\n19       Q.   And I mean, could you give the Court an idea\n20   of how many pre-engineered metal buildings you have\n21   built in the last 15 years?\n22       A.   I know of -- I know of 110 of them.\n23       Q.   Okay.   Now, when the building was -- let me\n24   ask you, this February 5th meeting, were you at the\n25   end of the project?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

We were in the middle of the\n2    project.\n3        Q.     So, they stopped SBS smack dab in the middle\n4    of an unfinished project?\n5        A.     Yes, sir.\n6        Q.     Okay.   So, if somebody went out there on\n7    February 5th and went -- and let's say that they went\n8    out there on March the 1st and started taking pictures\n9    of an unfinished project, what would those pictures\n10   show?\n11       A.     They would show an unfinished project.\n12       Q.     Okay.\n13       A.     I mean, it would show multiple things that\n14   weren't finished.\n15       Q.     Now, let me -- let me ask you; do you know\n16   what a wind bent is?\n17       A.     Yes, sir.\n18       Q.     Am I using the right word?\n19       A.     Yes, sir.\n20       Q.     Okay.   Was there ever a question about a wind\n21   bent?\n22       A.     There was not a question about a wind bent.\n23   There was a question about the hole that the wind bent\n24   was installed in.\n25       Q.     Okay.   Tell us about that.     Is that a problem\n\n\n\n                            TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                           PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                                123\n\n\n\n\n1    that came with a piece of material supplied from\n2    Schulte to the job site?\n3        A.   Yeah.   I mean, typically, the wind bent is\n4    placed in the field.     Every different building\n5    manufacturer has different specifications on how the\n6    wind bents are assembled.     And Schulte specified for\n7    the wind bents to be placed in the field.     And so,\n8    therefore, when the wind bents were installed, the\n9    slots that they fit in were cut there.\n10       Q.   Would you consider that to be a modification?\n11       A.   No, sir.\n12       Q.   Okay.   And if you made the hole in the field,\n13   would that make the building a used building?\n14       A.   Absolutely not.\n15       Q.   So, if somebody was wanting a new building,\n16   would you have -- would that be a new building if you\n17   had that hole in there that's been punched in the\n18   field?\n19       A.   Yes.    It's still a new building.\n20       Q.   Now, let me ask you, there's been some\n21   discussion today and/or yesterday and I think maybe\n22   Monday about a dip in the roof.      Have you ever heard\n23   that phrase, a dip in the roof?\n24       A.   There's no dips in the roof.\n25       Q.   Okay.   If somebody was to say there was a dip\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n5        Q.   Okay.   Tell us how SBS built the roof on the\n6    Tri-Bar project.\n7        A.   I guess generically, in the construction\n8    industry, a dip in the roof would be a hollow spot\n9    somewhere on the roof.     But they -- what they're\n10   referring to is a sloped area at the end of the roof.\n11       Q.   Okay.   Now, yesterday Mr. Key talked about\n12   how -- the way that SBS builds roofs that -- on a\n13   project like this, that you go up 5 feet to the first\n14   purlin and insert a raised clip?\n15       A.   Yes, sir.\n16       Q.   Is that the way you do it?\n17       A.   Yes, sir.\n18       Q.   And so, the roof sort of makes a slight\n19   upward dip?\n20       A.   Correct.\n21       Q.   And then drops off; is that correct?\n22       A.   Yes, sir.\n23       Q.   Why would you ever do that?\n24       A.   Well, you have to have some space between the\n25   roof and the purlins to install the insulation.       So,\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                         PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                                 125\n\n\n\n\n1    the clip that is in the inner field of the roof is\n2    usually higher than the clip that is on the edge of\n3    the roof.   The clip on the edge of the roof ties the\n4    roof down to the last member that's there, so wind\n5    does not get underneath it and try and lift it up.\n6    And the second thing is so water drips off the roof\n7    and doesn't try to clog on the underside of the roof\n8    back into the building.\n9        Q.   Okay.   Now, I will assert to you that there\n10   have been a number of pictures that have been provided\n11   by Tri-Bar's counsel of the project.         And I can go\n12   through each one of them with you, but -- and they\n13   show things that need to be done; maybe a bad cut,\n14   maybe insulation, you know, various things.        Okay.    In\n15   the middle of a project, would that be unusual to find\n16   things like that?\n17       A.   No, sir.    They're items that we would go\n18   through and punch --\n19       Q.   Okay.\n20       A.   -- and have repaired or have finished.\n21       Q.   So, if someone was to sit here and go through\n22   picture after picture after picture after picture\n23   showing, quote, defects on the property, that would be\n24   just things that would be remedied at the conclusion\n25   of the project; correct?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

No, sir.\n15       Q.     Can you remember having seen one at any other\n16   time, other than through the discovery process in this\n17   case?\n18       A.     No.\n19       Q.     Now, you were told at some point -- or let me\n20   ask you.   You tried to come out -- back out -- or you\n21   wanted to come back out to fix the problems; correct?\n22       A.

This seems\n21   to be an e-mail from you to Mr. Pittman saying that,\n22   you know, Tom had made representation about getting a\n23   closeout check and, you know, now we're three weeks\n24   down the road and you still hadn't gotten a closeout\n25   check?\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

And how long had SBS been off the site\n3    at this point?\n4        A.     Since February 5th; three weeks.\n5        Q.     Okay.   Now, was there another entity coming\n6    in that Jack cooperated with in terms of taking over\n7    the job?\n8        A.     Yes.    There was another contractor.\n9        Q.     Okay.   At this time in February -- at the end\n10   of February, had anyone told you about defects or\n11   problems related to the property?\n12       A.     I don't remember exactly when the letter came\n13   in regards to the defects.\n14       Q.     Okay.   I want you to look at Exhibit 15,\n15   please.\n16       A.

Is that\n20   what it says at the bottom of the e-mail?\n21       A.     Yes, sir.\n22       Q.     Okay.   It says, \"We'll be filing a lien on\n23   the property on Friday, February 15\"?\n24       A.

It says that you've\n5    placed a number of calls to Pittman, but have not\n6    gotten a return call.\n7        A.     That's correct.\n8        Q.     Is that starting to be the wall of silence\n9    that you're encountering when dealing on this project?\n10       A.     Yes.\n11       Q.     Okay.    Both in terms of getting paid or being\n12   told about problems or reasons why -- or problems with\n13   the job or reasons why you're not getting paid; is\n14   that right?\n15       A.     Right.\n16       Q.     Okay.    Now, I want you to take a look at\n17   Exhibit 17, correspondence to Mr. Pittman dated March\n18   19th.    Can you tell us about this letter?\n19       A.     Basically, it's just telling Mr. Pittman that\n20   we'd like to get paid again, and that he made some\n21   representations in the February 15th meeting -- and\n22   I'm not reading it word for word, but we'd like him to\n23   live up to those representations.\n24       Q.

Yes, sir.\n4        Q.   Okay.   And then, I want you to get down to\n5    the fourth paragraph -- or third paragraph.     And it\n6    says, \"We've submitted e-mails, numerous calls seeking\n7    the opportunity to meet, discuss steps requiring to\n8    complete the closeout process.\"\n9        A.   Where are you at?      I'm lost.\n10       Q.   Do you see where it says that?\n11       A.   No.\n12       Q.   Yes?\n13       A.   No.    Where are we?\n14       Q.   It's on page SBS-2008 of that exhibit.\n15       A.   Okay.\n16       Q.   In that third paragraph.      Do you see that?\n17       A.   Yes.\n18       Q.   Is that a -- I mean, that's what was\n19   happening is that, at least as far as March the 19th,\n20   as far as Mr. Pittman was concerned, the wall of\n21   silence was continuing?\n22       A.   Correct.\n23       Q.   Okay.   And it says no calls have been\n24   returned, no exchange of information?\n25       A.   Correct.\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

And then apparently, there's another\n2    paragraph right after that.\n3        A.    Uh-huh.\n4        Q.    Take a minute and read that for a second.\n5        A.    (Witness complying.)\n6        Q.    What is that paragraph about?\n7        A.    Well, it's referencing a letter that was\n8    issued by John Grable, basically saying that we have a\n9    real problem with the -- or they had a real problem\n10   with some things they were seeing on the job and that\n11   we should be calling our insurance company.\n12       Q.    And you dispute that, don't you?\n13       A.    Yes, sir.\n14       Q.    Okay.   Then you go on to say, \"The dimensions\n15   of the foundation were extended from the original\n16   design specs as a result of meetings and discussions\n17   with Grable.   The foundation was reformed and\n18   inspected prior to pouring.\"     Okay.   And then it says,\n19   \"By several e-mails among and between SBS, Grable, and\n20   Victor de Anda on August 18th, 2012, supported by the\n21   field observation report, both de Anda and Grable\n22   approved and poured the foundation that's currently in\n23   place.\"   Is that your understanding?\n24       A.    Yes, sir.\n25       Q.    Okay.   Now, to your -- in your experience --\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

In your\n2    experience, is it typical for a structural engineer to\n3    go out and inspect and verify the area for a concrete\n4    pour?\n5        A.   Yes, definitely.\n6        Q.   Do you have any reason to believe that Mr. de\n7    Anda did not do that in this case?\n8        A.   No.    I have no reason to believe he did not\n9    do it.\n10       Q.   Have you seen -- have you seen any document\n11   that says that he didn't go out there and take a look\n12   at the -- at the foundation pour site?\n13       A.   No, sir.\n14       Q.   Okay.    So, there's been some testimony about\n15   a building lug.   Have you heard about that?\n16       A.   Yes.\n17       Q.   If there was a problem with the building lug,\n18   that would have been available to be seen.     That\n19   wasn't covered up, was it?\n20       A.   It would be very obvious.      It would be on the\n21   edge of the foundation forms.\n22       Q.   And if the -- and if the structural engineer\n23   who -- let me back up.

The pour site was open for anybody to\n7    take a look at?\n8        A.    Correct.\n9        Q.    Okay.   Do you know whether or not Mr. de Anda\n10   approved the pour?\n11       A.    I did not see him on the site.\n12       Q.    Okay.   Have you seen anything where he did\n13   not approve the pour?\n14       A.    No, sir.    But Mr. Pittman was there and John\n15   Grable.   And I'm sure if he hadn't approved the pour,\n16   they wouldn't have poured.      They would have stopped.\n17       Q.    Now, to your knowledge, was any other\n18   concrete poured on that project other than on the two\n19   pour dates?\n20       A.    No, sir.\n21       Q.    And they were two consecutive pour dates;\n22   right?\n23       A.    Yes.    They were -- the foundation was poured\n24   two days in a row.\n25       Q.

That was back in -- that\n2    would have been billed in September.         Does that sound\n3    right to you?\n4        A.

Let me ask you, in your experience in the\n16   business, what happens when a small tradesman or a\n17   concrete supplier like, you know, we've got in this\n18   case doesn't get paid?\n19       A.   It's very disillusioning.      They do not want\n20   to come out and work.\n21       Q.   Exactly.    And what impact does that have on\n22   any trade if they don't get paid, coming back out to\n23   the job site?\n24       A.   It has a serious impact on it.\n25       Q.

I don't remember.     We offered to pay for some\n3    materials.\n4        Q.   Now, let me ask you, did you offer -- did SBS\n5    offer to pay these tradesmen out of its own pocket if\n6    Pittman would guarantee that y'all would get paid\n7    back?\n8        A.   No, sir.    What we offered was to pay for\n9    concrete in advance because the nonpayment from Lewis\n10   to the concrete contractor -- to the concrete supplier\n11   would not allow us -- he would not allow us to buy any\n12   concrete on any type of credit.      We would have to pay\n13   in advance.   And yes, I offered Mr. Pittman, if he\n14   would assure me that I could -- I would be reimbursed\n15   for the moneys that we would put out of SBS, that we\n16   would pay for future concrete in order to get the job\n17   -- to continue the job.\n18       Q.   And did Mr. Pittman give you that assurance\n19   of payment?\n20       A.   No, sir.\n21       Q.   Okay.\n22       A.   We didn't do it.\n23       Q.

It's\n3    effectively difficult to manage a construction project\n4    when the payment process is not reasonable and when\n5    authorized change orders are not approved and executed\n6    in time.\"   Okay.   The project plans and specifications\n7    are continually being adjusted.      Could you tell me\n8    what you meant when you put that in that letter?\n9        A.   Yes.    When you have consistent changes and\n10   you add on top of it the fact that you're not being --\n11   being consistently paid and you have the additional\n12   burden of change orders that aren't approved.       So,\n13   therefore, you're truly liable for that amount of\n14   money without any authorization, which really\n15   compounds the amount of risk that you have in regards\n16   to receivables.\n17       Q.   Now, are you aware that there have been a\n18   number of e-mails from Mr. Grable where he accepts\n19   responsibility for communication problems; that he's\n20   -- where he admits that he's had communication\n21   problems, that it was his fault?      Are you aware of\n22   those e-mails?\n23       A.   I don't know.\n24                   MR. SLATES:   Objection, mischaracterizes\n25   the record.\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

But would that seem to complement what\n6    you're talking about in your letter?\n7        A.   Yeah.    There was not a lot of cohesiveness\n8    between the architect, Mr. Pittman, and SBS\n9    communication-wise.\n10       Q.   Now, you -- this isn't your first project\n11   with Mr. Grable, is it?\n12       A.   Yes, it is.\n13       Q.   Did you ever do another project for Mr.\n14   Hixon?\n15       A.   Yes.    We do all of Hixon's.\n16       Q.   Is Mr. Grable an architect for Mr. Hixon?\n17       A.   I don't know that.\n18       Q.   Okay.    Did you ever build a metal building\n19   for Mr. Hixon?\n20       A.   I've built quite a number of them.\n21       Q.   Okay.    Did you ever have this kind of problem\n22   with Mr. Hixon?\n23       A.   It's Hixon Properties, and no, I did not.\n24       Q.   Okay.

There was no prior inspections.\n13       Q.    It says, \"Efforts are underway to complete a\n14   detailed list outlining these defects and how they\n15   would be resolved.     Okay.   To your knowledge, have you\n16   ever seen such a list that tells you -- outlines each\n17   defect and how it will be resolved?\n18       A.    No, sir.\n19       Q.    Okay.    Now, you may have gotten a list of\n20   purported defects, or maybe through the discovery\n21   process you may have seen a list of purported defects\n22   and how they were resolved.

How -- you've been building these\n7    things for 15 years.\n8          A.   Yes, sir.\n9          Q.   Was the building, as far as you know, out of\n10   plumb?\n11         A.   To our standards, it was perfectly plumb.\n12         Q.   Okay.

No, sir.\n22         Q.   As a matter of fact, you were told you\n23   weren't allowed back on the job?\n24         A.   That's correct.\n25         Q.   Okay.

No, sir.\n5        Q.    I mean, there's no more way of verifying that\n6    than you or Mr. Key or anybody else saying, as far as\n7    you're concerned, it was -- it was plumb?\n8        A.    Correct.\n9        Q.    Okay.   As a matter of fact, someone may have\n10   looked at the CMU or the brick work and the CMU or\n11   brick work may have been out of plumb.\n12       A.

A phone call.\n12       Q.    And how did that phone call go?\n13       A.    He basically just told me that -- that they\n14   did not like the fact that Robertson was going to file\n15   a lien.   And they did not like the pricing they got on\n16   the change order from Robertson.     And that we should\n17   -- that they had already secured another electrician\n18   to come on the job.   And that we should replace\n19   Robertson immediately; and if we didn't, more than\n20   likely, we could be next.\n21       Q.    Okay.

Now, tell me, on this change order;\n11   Robertson gave you change order or gave you a pricing\n12   on a change order?\n13       A.   Yes, sir.\n14       Q.   You submitted it to the owner; correct?\n15       A.   Jack Green did.\n16       Q.   Okay.   And then apparently, there was some\n17   modification; correct?\n18       A.   Yes.\n19       Q.   The price went down -- I think there has been\n20   some testimony that the price -- that Robertson cut\n21   his price in half or something like that.\n22       A.

And how -- how typical is it on the\n5    job that you've seen for the owner to have already\n6    established a relationship with an outside vendor and\n7    come in and said, oh, we've already decided to hire\n8    somebody else and fire this person, so we want to use\n9    our guy?\n10       A.     I've not had that happen before.\n11       Q.     That would be very unusual?\n12       A.     Yes, sir.\n13       Q.     Okay.

That was after the field modification had\nalready occurred, wasn't it?\n    A.     The field modification had occurred prior to\nus -- prior to the first meeting.\n    Q.     My question to you, Mr. Schiffman, is, can\nyou point me to any evidence that would suggest that\nthe owner was provided notice that you were going to\nfield modify that building to make it fit the\nfoundation before you did it?\n    A.     The field modification you're referring to\nwas there the day Tom Pittman and the engineers and\neverybody else came out and inspected the job.\n    Q.     My point, Mr. Schiffman, is at that point\nyou've got a building that's erected, you've got\nhangar doors that are installed, and you've got wing\nwalls that aren't big enough to accommodate the door\nopening so it doesn't open to 80 feet.       I'm talking\nabout before they built those walls, they had to cut\nthose metal members somehow or modify them in some way\nto make them fit on that foundation.        And I want to\nknow what evidence you can point me to to say the\nowner was put on notice of that before it was done and\ngiven an opportunity to approve it.     It doesn't exist,\ndoes it?\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

I want to hand you what's been marked as\nExhibit Number 120 -- SBS 120.     There was a statement\nmade that Mr. Grable was made aware of the discrepancy\nbetween the size of the foundation and the fact that\nthe building that was being fabricated was going to be\ntoo big for that foundation.     And reference was made\nto Mr. Grable approving the shop drawings.     Do you see\nhis signature on the last page of that?\n    A.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.     Can you show me in the shop drawings where it\npoints out the conflict?\n    A.     It's on page -- I can't read all this.   It's\ntoo small.\n    Q.     I can't read it either.   What I'm trying to\nget at is, there may be -- if you look at one page and\nlook at another page -- an inconsistency.     But nobody\ncalled that to his attention, did they?\n    A.     It came back as a denotation on the shop\ndrawings that were shipped to the architect.\n               MR. SLATES:   I don't have an extra copy\nof this.   I'm sorry.   So, let me look at it for a\nsecond.\n               MR. CLUCK:    Mr. Slates, that might be\nExhibit 119 that you're looking for.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

It's 119.\n               MR. SLATES:    119 is the e-mail where it\nsays verify field dimensions?\n               MR. CLARK:    And it notes the discrepancy.\n               MR.

Am I supposed to go through all these plans\nor what?\n    Q.     You know what?    In the interest of time,\nlet's move along.    With respect to the payment, there\nwas -- the building was supposed to be delivered back\nin August, and then it was September, and then it was\nin October.   So, when this pay application is pending,\nthe building is late, isn't it?\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And the building is delivered in November and\nthe erection begins.    So, you get paid after the\nbuilding gets delivered and you get progress on\ngetting the building erected.    That's what happened,\nisn't it?\n    A.   I thought the building was delivered in\nOctober, the way I remember it.\n    Q.   The record in this case shows the building\nwas delivered November 7th, I'll represent to you.\n    A.   Okay.\n    Q.   And that erection began soon thereafter.\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   Continued into December and January.     And so,\nlate building, no building, and then once the building\ngets there and progress gets made, you get paid;\nright?\n    A.   That's what it shows.     Yes.\n    Q.   Okay.    You testified -- first of all -- I\ntake that back.   Let's move along.    You testified,\nbased on some photographs that weren't shown to you\nthat you think that -- or at least not presented to\nyou in court today -- that you think that the work\nthat was done was cost to complete basically; is that\nright?\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

In other words, it wasn't defective work; it\nwas work that just needed to be done to complete the\nwork in place.\n    A.     Quite a bit of it.     Yes.\n    Q.     Is that what your testimony is?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Okay.    Let's assume that's true.       The\n$317,000.00 cost to complete as reflected in the\ndefect plan.      And then you guys weren't done with the\nproject when you got terminated, were you?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     There was other work that needed to be done\nin addition to the work to fix the metal building --\nor to use your words, to complete the metal building;\ncorrect?\n    A.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.     If we go to Tri-Bar Number 9, I want to focus\non the schedule of values.       First of all, that's the\nlast pay app -- I'll represent to you, the testimony\nhas been this was for the retainage.           And if we look\non that first page, do you see the -- the balance to\nfinish shows to be $400,051.24?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     All right.     Now, if we go to the schedule of\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

I'll\nrepresent to you that I don't think we're arguing\nabout concrete staining here.      At line item 22,\ncabinets and millwork, 14,150.       Do you see that?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     And I'm sorry.    I'm looking in the Balance to\nFinish column.     I'm trying to move fast here.     I\napologize if I'm not being clear.       The balance to\nfinish, that's work that's not yet done; correct?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Work that needs to be done to finish the\nproject?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     And again, cabinets and millwork; I don't\nthink we're arguing about that.       Cedar plank cladding,\n20,529.82.   Do you see that one at line item 24?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Paint, 17,500.    See that one, line item\nnumber 32?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Okay.    And plumbing shows 33,300.   But we do\nhave a claim for $14,000.00 in defective work on\nplumbing.    So, I'm going to back that one down to\n19,000; okay.      33 minus the 14, leaving a balance of\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Does that make sense to you?      If our claim\nthat we spent 14,000 in defective work, the balance it\ncost to complete would be 19?\n      A.   (Witness nodding head up and down.)\n      Q.   Is that a yes?\n      A.   I'm confused.\n      Q.   Plumbing, 33.\n      A.   Yes, sir.\n      Q.   I'll represent to you that the defect claim\nwe're making for plumbing is 13,300, and I'm\nrounding --\n      A.   Okay.\n      Q.   -- or 13,700, so I'm rounding it up to 14.\nAnd I'm backing that down to 19.      14 and 19 is 33.\n      A.   Right.\n      Q.   And then on electrical cost to finish is\n39,550.    But I'll represent to you that the claim for\nelectrical is just shy -- I think it's 4,250, but\nlet's call it 5, just to be conservative.       So, make\nthat 34,550.    Now, can you add up those numbers for\nme?\n      A.   122,964.82 is what I got.\n      Q.   122,964.82 plus 317,900 equals what?

But there's a lot of other\nones, aren't there?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   So, if you treat it as a cost to complete\nanalysis, you've exceeded the balance of the contract,\nhaven't you?\n    A.   I don't know if you have the change orders\nincluded.\n    Q.   I'll represent to you that the testimony in\nthis case is that this does include the change orders.\n    A.

This is the meeting minutes.\nWe've seen it a million times, but you're the guy that\nwas there and they're your words, so I want to ask you\nabout them.   Now, if we go to the first page, Mr.\nCluck again suggested that no reason was given other\nthan Rod wanted to terminate.    But what did Tom\nPittman say right here?    \"Felt that we gave every\nchance; a lot of delays\"?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   There had been a lot of delays, hadn't there?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   And there had been a lot of discussions about\ndelays, hadn't there?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   And there had been a lot of dissatisfaction\non the part of the owner because of the delays, had\nthere not been?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   And your response immediately to that was,\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

We're disappointed; we understand part of it.\nSo, when he says, gave you every chance, lots of\ndelays; your response is, we understand part of it.\nRight?\n    A.     That's what it says.      Yes.\n    Q.     And it doesn't say anywhere in there that you\nwere protesting, saying, no, there weren't any delays;\nyou didn't give us lots of chances.         You didn't say\nthat, did you?\n    A.     I was very discombobulated by the fact that\nwe were being taken off the job.        There were a lot of\nthings I probably said that I didn't understand\nmyself.\n    Q.     That sounds like a no, you didn't say that.\n    A.     That's what I just said.\n    Q.     Okay.   And then further down, Mr. Cluck\ndidn't ask you about this either.        It says, not seen\nthe best side of SBS Construction for many reasons.\nYou were acknowledging you didn't provide the kind of\nservice that you expected to provide to your client,\nweren't you?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     Well, if we didn't see the best side of SBS,\nwhat side did we see, Mr. Schiffman?\n    A.     You know, it's -- you're taking it out of\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

It's really saying that you guys didn't\nreally see the best side of SBS for many reasons.        And\nthe many reasons are all the changes, all the things\nthat took place, the lack of communication, et cetera,\net cetera.\n    Q.     Let's look at the next page.      Here you said,\nthis is a job site -- I understand.      We're upfront\nforthright people.     We had some problems and we're\ntruly sorry about it.    You're acknowledging that SBS\nhad problems on the project, aren't you?\n    A.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.     And in fact, you're not just acknowledging\nit; you're apologizing for it and acknowledging\nresponsibility for it?\n    A.     I think that -- I think that was -- what I'm\ndoing is just babbling at that point because I didn't\nknow what else to say.\n    Q.     Well, your babble was an apology and\nacknowledgement of problems; correct?\n    A.     There were some problems.   There's problems\non every project that we're on.     But they're always\novercome.    They're always worked on.      They're always\nworked out.\n    Q.

You said, to your standards, meaning SBS's\nstandards, the building was perfectly plumb.\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   Knowing what we know about this case and\nhaving heard the evidence we've heard, do you think\nit's safe to conclude that the owner's standards may\nbe a little higher than your standards?\n    A.

The way the submittal process works, the\ngeneral contractor asks for the supplier to provide\nthe shop drawings.\n    Q.    Uh-huh.\n    A.    Then the other contractor will need to first\nreview the shop drawings to see if they're in\ncompliance with the architectural and structural\nplans.   If there are any discrepancies, they need to\nnote them on the plans, then they need to submit to\nthe architect who's the lead on the design team.     Then\nthe architect will send the shop drawings to us and\nthen we'll review it against our plans to see if they\ncomply with ours.    If we find discrepancies, we'll\nnote it on the plans.\n    Q.    And whose ultimate responsibility is it to\nverify the dimensions and coordinate the shop drawings\nwith the other project drawings?\n    A.    The general contractor.\n    Q.

This e-mail was produced by BoDen in\nresponse to a subpoena issued by SBS.       And we have it\nhere in native form.    The e-mail that references an\nattachment is one down.     This is the response.   There\nwas no attachment in this e-mail chain.      I went in and\nverified.    These pictures were in the body of the\ne-mail.

Yes.    To extend the foundation.   Yes.\n    Q.    And why was the as-built condition of the\nfoundation an issue that -- that you guys needed to\naddress and provide a fix for?\n    A.    Because we were carrying veneer that is heavy\nand cannot be carried in a small piece of a concrete\nground without reinforcement.\n    Q.    What could potentially happen if you didn't\nreinforce?\n    A.    It can shear off; crack the edge.\n    Q.    Could it be a safety concern?\n    A.    That's correct.\n    Q.    Okay.   I'm going to switch gears on you a\nlittle bit.   There's been a lot of testimony in this\ncase regarding the hangar doors of the hangar.

You\ntestified earlier that you do changes and revisions to\nplan -- or to designs of that nature; is that correct?\n    A.   Yeah.

How do you identify the kind of document\nthat's it's been changed or revised?\n    A.

Once we\nprogressed with the project into a bigger -- I guess I\nproceeded into a bigger role as in going on sites,\nviewing progress, submitting everything to our owner.\n       Q.

Mr. Boddie, can you tell the Court about your\nbackground in the construction industry, including\nyour educational background?\n    A.     Sure.   I graduated from Texas A&M University,\nwith a degree in construction science.        I've been\nworking in construction for probably ten years,\nanywhere from Washington, D.C. to Kansas, San Antonio.\nWhen I was in school, I was working for an electrical\ncontractor.    I've had my own company now for about\nthree years.    Started off with Turner Construction,\nthe nation's largest general contractor.        So, I've\nbeen doing this for a while.\n    Q.     How did you get involved with the Los\nCerritos Hangar project?\n    A.     Through Tom Pittman.    Working with Turner, I\nmet Tom.   We did a project together.        And when I\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

What did you understand your role to be on\nthe Los Cerritos Hangar project?\n    A.   I was going to be the construction manager.\nSo, the way that Tom approached me about it was to\nhold all the contracts through his company -- not\nTom's company, but through Lewis.     And then I was\ngoing to manage all the trades on the site.\n    Q.   Did you also have conversations with Mr.\nPittman about the condition of the SBS work?\n    A.   We did.\n    Q.   Were you charged with doing anything to\ninvestigate the condition of the SBS work?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   What were you asked to do?\n    A.   I was asked to go around and -- and check the\nbuilding, see if there were any defects in the\nworkmanship.    Tom pointed out a couple areas to me\nthat he knew about, including the hangar door pockets.\nSome of the big ticket items, like the framing, were\ndiscussed early on.   When Tom and I first met out\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Did you solicit input from a metal building\ncompany?\n    A.     We did.   Speedway Erectors.\n    Q.     Speedway Erectors was the name of the\ncompany?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Did you accompany Speedway representatives\nfor portions of their inspections?\n    A.     I did.\n    Q.     Did you have interactions with them about the\nthings that they observed?\n    A.     I did.    We spent an entire day walking around\nlooking at defects in the metal building, installation\nquality that wasn't up to industry standards.      And you\nknow, we climbed up on the roof.       We were in man\nbaskets.   We were pretty thorough in our\ninvestigation.\n    Q.     Did you personally inspect all of the\nconditions of the project?\n    A.     I did.\n    Q.     And did a Speedway representative provide you\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

He did.\n    Q.    And based on your personal inspection of the\nconditions, can you confirm that those photographs\naccurately reflect the conditions on the project at\nthe time?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Did you personally observe all locations\nwhere those photographs were taken?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Did you also take photographs of the various\nconditions?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    Did you make observations about the\nconditions that you considered to be defective?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    And were you involved in evaluating whether\nor not the metal building was out of plumb?\n    A.    I was.\n    Q.    I want to direct your attention to SBS\nExhibit Number 84, which is in a binder up there.\n    A.    Which binder am I looking at now?\n    Q.    I tell you what; Ms. Brazell is going to pull\nit up.   That's probably the easiest way to do it.\nThis is an e-mail, as you can see, from Matthew\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And it's transmitting the building tolerances\nthat he received from Schulte.        Does that accurately\nreflect what that document is?\n    A.    Yes.\n    Q.    Do you recall receiving this?\n    A.    I do.\n    Q.    Did you review it to evaluate what the\ntolerances were for the building being out of plumb?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    And did you find some provisions that you\nthought would be applicable to that evaluation?\n    A.    Yes, sir.    Basically, right there in\n7.13.1.1, if you look at the second -- that section B\nright there, it talks about industry standards for\nsteel construction and how the columns are allowed to\nbe installed.\n    Q.

SLATES)    First let's figure out what\nthe tolerances are.\n    A.   Okay.   So, on a column, if you're looking\ndown a column, if this is your building line right\nhere, being the exterior of the building.   You're\nallowed within the first 20 stories, according to\nAmerican Institute of Steel Construction, that that\ncolumn can lean 1 inch in the first 20 stories towards\nthe outside of the building.    1 inch.\n    Q.   In 20 stories?\n    A.   20 stories.\n    Q.   How many stories is this building?\n    A.   Three max.\n    Q.   So, the math -- about a third of an inch?\n    A.   Yeah, give or take a little bit.    You can\nmake that argument.    And then you're allowed -- so,\nit's 1 inch this way, 2 inches towards the interior of\nthe building.\n    Q.   In 20 stories?\n    A.   In 20 stories.\n    Q.   Okay.   There's another provision I want to\ncall your attention to that Mr. Key referenced during\nhis testimony.   And I'll show it to you.   It's on the\nnext page from where we were.   Mr. Key called our\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

Yes.\n      A.   Yeah.\n      Q.   You noticed that before?\n      A.   Yeah.   I noticed that as well.   And you could\neasily say that we were way outside that tolerance.\n      Q.   So, if we calculate, based on a three-story\nbuilding, 1/16 of an inch, what would the tolerance\nbe?\n      A.   3/16.\n      Q.   So, using the language that you reference,\nthe tolerance would be what number?      Doing the\ncalculation based on the language we looked at just a\nmoment ago, it would be what?\n      A.   It would be less than an inch, a third of an\ninch.\n      Q.   And doing the calculation based on the\nsection Mr. Key pointed to, what would be the\ntolerance?\n      A.   3/16.\n      Q.   All right.   Now I want to ask you, how did\nyou go about determining whether or not the building\nwas within plumb?\n      A.   Sure.   So, the first step, obviously, is to\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Slap it on the side\nof a column, see what the level reads out, you know,\npull the level a little bit away from that column.        If\nthat level is -- you know, pull away from the column\nand a substantial amount over 4 feet, you know that\nyou're going to have a problem.\n                We identified that first.   And when we\nwent to our columns, we were able to set up a laser\nlevel at the base of the column.     And that laser level\nis self-righting, so it shines directly up and down in\na perfect plane.    So, we were able to measure\nbasically up the column, measure this distance here,\none in the middle, and one at the base and determine\nhow the column was leaning.\n    Q.   Am I understanding your testimony correctly\nthat you used a laser level to make that\ndetermination?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And in using the laser level, what did you\ndetermine as to how far out of plumb the building was?\n    A.   It was 2 inches.\n    Q.   Does that exceed both of the tolerances that\nwe just looked at?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   Does it exceed them by what level of\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

You know, it's -- if you go by 3/16,\nI mean, you're talking an inch and 9/16 -- or an inch\nand 13/16 out of plumb.    That's huge.\n    Q.   Okay.    You can sit back down.\n    A.   Sure.

The first tab is what?\n    A.   The first tab is PEMB labor by United\nErectors.   It's installing roof insulation and new\nroof sheets.\n    Q.   And why was that necessary?\n    A.   The removal of the roof was necessary in\norder to rack the building; in order to bring it back\nthe 2 inches that it was out of plumb.      It was also\nnecessary because the roof was installed improperly\nusing the wrong clips.   There were splices in the\nsheets which weren't allowed by the specifications.\nFor those three reasons, we had to remove the roof and\ninstall a new one.\n    Q.   If you can demonstrate for us at the easel\nwhat you mean by why you had to remove the roof to\nrack the building, and also the issue with the clips\nyou just referenced, I think that would be helpful.\n    A.   Sure.   (Witness complying.)      So, on any\nbuilding that you build, your roof is -- your roof is\nyour diaphragm of the building.    Any time that you\nbuild a steel building, specifically a metal\nbuilding -- if you look at the directions that are\ngiven in front of the documents, you can put the walls\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                  PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           215\n\n\n\n\non before you put the roof on, but you -- once you put\nthat roof on, it pretty well racks that building into\nits current location.\n             So, being as how our building was -- this\nis a little dramatic, but leaning 2 inches; in order\nfor us to pull these members back, we had to remove\nthe roof sheets.    You know, you run into the problem\nof -- with roof sheets like these -- these are\nstanding seam roof sheets.    Once they're seamed, you\ncan't just take one out.    You have to go all the way\nback to whichever one you want to get out.    So, let's\nsay your directional of your seams are running this\nway and you want to pull out a panel here.    In the\ncase of -- I guess we'll get to it later.    But in the\ncase of the spliced panel, you would have to take all\nof these sheets out in order to get to that panel.\n             Now, for us, it was -- it was a matter\nof solving three issues with this roof.     Right.   So,\nwhen we got the building back to plumb, we were able\nto lock the building back into place by putting a new\nroof system on.    We were also able to correct the\nsplices in the roof sheets and we were also able to\ncorrect the clips.\n    Q.   Tell us what the clip issue is.\n    A.   Okay.    So, if you were to look through this\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                         216\n\n\n\n\nbuilding, looking this way down this eave line right\nhere, what you would see is that eave line was doing\nthat number.   Essentially, there were three different\ntypes of clips used.    You have a high clip, a medium\nclip, and a low clip that was used all the way down\nthe eave of this building, creating a wave effect.\n               The way that the metal building\nmanufacturer recommends that you install these clips\nis one of two ways.    You can use a high, medium, and\nlow here, floating clip, or you can use a uniform\nclip; you could use a high or a medium or a low across\nthe entire building.    But that's not what they did.\n    Q.   Okay.    What did they do?\n    A.   They went across the roof sheets and would\nuse a high, a medium, a low, a medium, a high.    There\nwas no specific pattern to it across that eave.\n    Q.   Was there any consistency to how they used\nthe roof clips?\n    A.   There was not.\n    Q.   What did that create in the field?\n    A.   It created a wave pattern in the roof.\nEssentially, with that wave pattern, it created\ninconsistencies in the roof which could have\npotentially caused leaks later on.\n    Q.   Okay.    If I can take you back up to the\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So, we've also got some photographs\nat tab 1.   We got the invoice, which speaks for\nitself, and the amount that you've allocated as\nreflected in the spreadsheet.   But if we look at\ndeficiency Exhibit Number 1 -- photograph number 1,\ntell us what we're seeing there.\n    A.   What you're seeing -- if you look -- you can\nsee daylight coming in through that roof panel right\nthere.\n    Q.   Right here?\n    A.   So, you're looking underneath the ridge cap.\nAnd a piece of metal that is supposed to be a\nwatertight system from creating -- it basically\ncreates a condition where driving rain is supposed to\nbe kept out of there.   Unfortunately, they didn't use\nthe right flashing piece right there and water was --\nwater could potentially be able to enter the building\nat that point.\n    Q.   All right.    Let's look at photograph number 2\nin Exhibit Number 20.   What are we seeing here?\n    A.   You're seeing a condition where the roof\nsheets weren't cut short enough.    Roofs -- these roofs\nare made to expand and contract.    Essentially at that\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And if we go to photograph 3 in the\ndeficiency log?\n     A.   You're seeing a lack of tape seal connecting\nwith the roof panel system right there.      You can see\nthe wave in the tape seal beneath the end dam that\nwould create an air gap or a void space where water\ncould potentially get through.\n     Q.   Is that a problem?\n     A.   Absolutely.\n     Q.   All right.\n     A.   I don't want water in my buildings.\n     Q.   I don't like it in mine either.     Photograph\n4?\n     A.   Again, on the -- on the right side, you're\nseeing an air gap there where water could get in.\n     Q.   Photograph 5?\n     A.   You're seeing a condition looking from the\neave of the roof up to the -- up to the ridge.     You're\nseeing a -- a connection between the two roof panels.\n     Q.   If you want to articulate with the\nphotograph, feel free to come down.\n     A.   Okay.\n     Q.   I'm sorry.    I interrupted you.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

You're seeing the seam on a roof -- on two roof\npanels, you're seeing the condition that the different\nclips was causing with the roof panels, essentially\ncreating a gap at the bottom.\n    Q.     Okay.    And if we go to photograph 6 on the\ndeficiency log?\n    A.     You're seeing -- this is at the copula,\nlooking up -- or looking down into the building.\nYou're seeing a cut roof sheet that wasn't flashed\nproperly.\n    Q.     Is that the exterior of the building?\n    A.     That is the exterior.\n    Q.     If rain hits that location, what's going to\nhappen?\n    A.     It's going inside.\n    Q.     And if we go to photograph 7 in Exhibit 20?\n    A.     You're looking up one of the rakes right\nthere.    This piece was fabricated in the field.    This\nshould have been a manufactured piece by the metal\nbuilding company.\n    Q.     If we go to photograph 8, is that a similar\nlocation?\n    A.     It is.   It's just looking the opposite\ndirection.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Photograph 9; is that another\ncondition of flashing issues?\n    A.    That is.    It's another flashing issue.   If\nyou look to -- you've got some pretty bad welding\nmarks that have burned up the roof system here, as\nwell as the insulation down here.\n    Q.    Okay.   Photograph 10?\n    A.    You're looking at the three different types\nof clips that were used on that job.\n    Q.    When you talked about that undulating effect,\nhow does that correlate to those clips?\n    A.    You've got your high clip, your medium clip,\nand your low clip there.      By using those different\nclips, essentially, you know, the high clip is going\nto push that roof to sit higher and the low clip is\ngoing to push that roof to sit lower.\n    Q.    All right.     Photograph 11?\n    A.    That's a splice that was created in two\npanels.\n    Q.    Photograph 12?     It's not supposed to be like\nthat, is it?\n    A.    No.\n    Q.    All right.\n    A.    Not according to the documents.\n    Q.    And I think Mr. Schiffman acknowledged that\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Photograph 12 in Exhibit 20?\n    A.     This is looking down the door pockets.    You\ncan see here -- this only happened at the door pockets\nwhere the roof actually tapered off onto the sides.\nIt wasn't a uniform level condition.\n    Q.     What does that say in the text box?\n    A.     \"Shows roof drop-off at front end wall.     Same\ncondition on both sides of the building due to\nimproper field fabrication of shortened door pockets.\n    Q.     Tell us what you mean by the reference to the\nfield fabrication of the shortened door pockets.\n    A.     Sure.   I'll draw it.   So, the roof system\ncame down, and then where it hit the door pocket, it\nkind of curved off here.     What happened is, when these\ndoor pockets were shortened up, a piece was fabricated\nto sit on top of a column.     When they brought the\ncolumns in, it appeared to me as though calculations\nwere done improperly.     This slope right here should\nhave been straight and level; but instead, this piece\nwas cut too short.    They tried to shim it up, if you\nwill.    And when they did that, it created the -- the\nslope in the roof panels.\n    Q.     Is that associated with the field fabrication\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    On the next photograph 13 in\nExhibit Number 20, is that the same condition, just a\ndifferent view?\n    A.   It is.\n    Q.   Photograph 14 of Exhibit Number 20; is that\nanother spliced roof panel?\n    A.   It is.\n    Q.   Photograph 15 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.   This is the ridge cap.\n    Q.   Where is that; at the top of the building?\n    A.   Yes, sir.    The very peak.   They're missing\nscrews in here.   If you look at the construction\ndocuments from Schulte, there's an improper amount of\nscrews that were included in that.\n    Q.   Okay.    Let's look at photograph 16.\n    A.   Same condition.    It's -- not as the previous,\nbut at the ridge cap here, you've got an air gap\nallowing water to enter the system.\n    Q.   And is 17 the same issue?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   How about 18?\n    A.   That's a picture of the clips, looking\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

We were able to pull\nup a panel and look at those.\n    Q.    Okay.    19?\n    A.    That's actually looking down the eave.       And\nyou can see the undulation in the roof panel as it\ngoes up and down, right here being the most notable.\n    Q.    Is that looking towards the front of the\nhangar?\n    A.    That is.\n    Q.    So, the structure that we see there, the\nmetal structure extending out beyond the building, is\nthat the wing wall that would hold the hangar door?\n    A.    It is.    And actually, if you look right here,\nthat's the piece that's field fabricated.      This column\nwas cut down.     This was field fabricated in order to\ntry and make that slope work, but it was\nmiscalculated.\n    Q.    All right.     Let's look at 20 of Exhibit\nNumber 20 -- photograph 20.\n    A.    You're looking here at a missing piece of\nright trim and a panel -- roof panel that was cut.\nShouldn't have been cut that way.\n    Q.    21 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.    Same panel.

You can.\n    Q.   Tell us what -- why that is.\n    A.   Essentially, there's two reasons.   All right.\nOne is, you've got longer panels right here.   So, you\nshould be able to see the little bit longer line, but\nyou should not see that shift in the slope right here.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Right here looking at -- we used a laser\nagain to measure the plumbness of the door tracks up\non the top of the main supports.       These pieces right\nhere were fabricated -- field modified prior to us\narriving on site, and it caused the hangar door track\nto be out of plumb.     It was basically a corrective\naction because the building was out of place, and the\nbuilding was racked.      And so, what we knew is, once\nthat building was brought back in, that these were\ngoing to be out of plumb.\n    Q.    Okay.   Let's go to 30.\n    A.    You're looking underneath -- this is the\nrailing that supports the door.       These are all thread\nrods which were inserted into the concrete and a piece\nof angle that was supporting the -- the track right\nthere.   The door was currently sitting on that door\ntrack causing a bend.\n    Q.    Is that supposed to be like that?\n    A.    No, sir.    In fact, you're not supposed to put\nthose doors on until you pour the concrete.\n    Q.    31, is that the same condition?\n    A.    Yes, sir.    You can see here, you're actually\nmissing -- you're not missing -- the nut is there, but\nit's not connected to the all-thread.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

You're looking at missing stitch bolts in two\npurlins.\n    Q.     33 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.     Same thing; missing stitch bolts.    You're\nlooking at a clip where that purlin is supposed to be\nconnected to that -- to that beam right there, and\nit's not connected.\n    Q.     34 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.     Same thing; you're missing bolts.\n    Q.     35?\n    A.     Missing bolts.\n    Q.     What does the -- what does the text box say\non that one?\n    A.     \"Mid span support beam installed backwards.\"\nAnd this is -- this is the same thing that we were\ntalking about earlier.      That's the door track down\nhere -- the supports for it.     And this piece right\nhere was field modified and incorrectly installed.\n    Q.     Photograph number 36 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.     You're looking at the copula.     You're looking\nat the beam that was -- or yeah, you're looking at a\nbeam that was welded to a column.      It wasn't welded\nall the way around.    Typically in this position,\nyou'll see something that's welded on all four sides.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Bolts missing in connection due to the\nmisalignment.\"\n       Q.   Where is that?\n       A.   So, you're focusing on this piece right here,\nand then it's missing these bolts right here.\n       Q.   Is that the field modification the -- to the\nwing walls for the hangar door?\n       A.   It is.\n       Q.   Show us how they field modified it, if you\ncan tell.\n       A.   Well, it's kind of a bad picture to do that\non.\n       Q.   Okay.    Yeah.   The next photograph is 38.\n       A.   This is more showing the misalignment of the\ndoor track.       You can see it curves in and out.\n       Q.   39?\n       A.   You're looking at purlins not being attached\nto the clips right here.\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

And photograph 40 of Exhibit Number\n20?\n      A.   This is showing the spandrel beam up here.\nWhere it was located when we got on the job, it was\nactually going to intersect through windows, and so it\nhad to be relocated.\n      Q.   41 of Exhibit Number 20?\n      A.   You're looking at -- you're looking up at the\ncopula.    You're looking at insulation that wasn't\ntucked.    You can also see, there were backup plates\nhere that were supposed to be installed on all of\nthese roof sheets that weren't installed.\n      Q.   Now, in photograph 42 of Exhibit 20, what are\nwe seeing?\n      A.   This is looking at door pockets.   You're\nstanding in front of the hangar looking out.    These\npieces that are running here, John, these horizontal\npieces were the ones that were field modified.    They\nwere cut down in order to accommodate the foundation\nsize.\n      Q.   Did that create a problem in the roof line\nthat we saw earlier?\n      A.   It did.\n      Q.   If we go to 43 of Exhibit 20?\n      A.   You're looking back up at the copula again.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

All right.     44?\n    A.   You're looking at the door here that was\nmissing some X-bracing, missing a couple bolts.       You\ncan see this -- this cutout right here in this beam\nwas -- didn't have bracing supporting it.\n    Q.   All right.     45?\n    A.   Same thing.    Missing bolts.      You've got one\nclip here with one bolt in it.\n    Q.   Okay.    46?\n    A.   Same thing.    Missing bolts.\n    Q.   47?\n    A.   This is the wind bracing; again, missing\nclips that attached to the CMU wall.\n    Q.   If we look at 48, what do we see?\n    A.   You're seeing bracing that we had to install\non that wall.    That being the windward side, there was\na concern on our part that the wind could affect that\nCMU wall since it wasn't braced off to the wind braces\non the building.\n    Q.   What's in the text box on that one?\n    A.   \"Superstructure was erected out of plumb.\nEnd wall columns lean 2 inches towards the west.       No\ngap at bottom of column versus top of column.\"       So, if\nyou look here, you got more light coming through down\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

And the next one is -- is\nphotograph 49.   What do we see there?\n      A.   You're looking at what I refer to as basic\nred oxide framing.      This framing was installed not per\nthe specifications that were on the architectural\ndrawings.\n      Q.   Can we actually -- I think I have a --\nactually, let's pull up Tri-Bar 27.     What do the\nstructural plans call for in terms of the framing?\n      A.   So, this number right here; it's a little\ntough to read, I understand.     But essentially, this\nnumber right here is an identification code for a type\nof metal stud to be used.     If you were to give that\nto any metal stud supplier, they would be able to\ngive you an exact piece.     It calls out the thickness,\nthe size, the height -- or the length, rather, the\ngauge of the metal, what it's supposed to be finished\nas.   It's basically a very specific identification\ncode.\n      Q.   And this is hard to read, but what is it\nsupposed to be in terms of how far they're supposed to\nbe off center?\n      A.   16-inches.\n      Q.   What does it say here?\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           232\n\n\n\n\n    A.     \"All materials to be galvanize coded in\naccordance with ASTM and 8525 C-80 touch-up field\nwelds with zinc rich paint.\"\n    Q.     Did SBS use galvanized materials?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     What did they use?\n    A.     They used basically red oxide primer.\n    Q.     Did SBS do 16-inch off center?\n    A.     No, sir.    They were 2 foot.\n    Q.     Okay.   All right.    Let's go back to Tri-Bar\n20 and go to photograph 50.       And what do we have in\nour text box here?\n    A.     This is purlins that they were using for the\nroof system.     Essentially, what they were doing is\nthey were creating a space by bending up the top of\nthe purlin -- that purlin, when it's recalled out of\nthe factory, looks like that.       What they were doing is\nbending this up, compromising the integrity of that\nframing.   So, had you put a load on top of it -- say,\nconcrete -- it would have -- it would have come\ncrashing down eventually.\n    Q.     And was that called for there?\n    A.     No.   It was not called to do that.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     This isn't even the right member to be\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                      PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                      233\n\n\n\n\ninstalled as a -- as a roof frame member.\n    Q.    Go to photograph 51 of 20.\n    A.    This is where you -- we took the spacers out\nso that you can more clearly see the bends in the\nZ-purlins.\n    Q.    Okay.   Photograph 52 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.    Same thing, looking down the line.\n    Q.    What does the note say?\n    A.    \"Spacing of the purlins did not match the\narchitectural drawings located at 16 inches on center.\nNote, the box beam headers did not exist to frame the\nopenings.\"\n    Q.    All right.\n    A.    So, typically, when you're using light gauge\nmetal framing, you create box beam headers to go over\nwindows, doors, et cetera.\n    Q.    How about photograph 53 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.    You're missing a double purlin in the inside\ncorner.\n    Q.    54?\n    A.    This is again showing where we took out the\nbracing on the purlins.\n    Q.    How about 55?\n    A.    This is still showing the incorrect type of\nsteel framing.    You know, things like rather than\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

How about photograph 56 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.     This is showing the clips on the wind\nbracing.   You're also looking at the spacing of the\nstuds that are above the CMU walls -- the doors for\nthe track that's holding those studs in place.\n    Q.     Let's go to 57.\n    A.     You're looking at the -- us taking\nmeasurements of the -- the studs that are currently in\nplace.   That says 2 foot, but you can't read that.\n    Q.     As opposed to 16 inches?\n    A.     That's correct.\n    Q.     Is 58 the same thing?\n    A.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.     Go to 59.\n    A.     Same thing.\n    Q.     And how about 60 -- photograph 60 of Exhibit\nNumber 20?\n    A.     This is looking at the door pockets and the\nstart of making the extension on those to get back to\n(inaudible) the doors.\n    Q.     All right.    61?\n    A.     This is -- this is a picture of us taking\ndown the -- the door pockets -- or the doors, rather.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

What does that text box say?\n    A.   \"Hangar doors and pocket door columns out of\nplumb, incorrectly field modified.      Rather than\ncorrecting the footing, door pockets were shortened to\nmatch the concrete poured in place.      Need to remove\nand correct.\"\n    Q.   How about -- go ahead.\n    A.   I was just going to add that, in order to do\nsome of the -- the work associated with moving the\ntracks for the doors and pouring the trough back for\nthe door tracks, we had to remove the doors.\n    Q.   How about 62 -- photograph 62 in Exhibit 20?\n    A.   Same thing.     You're looking at the hangar\ndoor pockets.    This is progress of us taking down some\nof that steel.\n    Q.   Tell us what we see in photograph 63 of\nExhibit 20.\n    A.   This is the trench drain that was installed\nwhen we got on-site.     These are -- these are actually\nsurvey stakes that were used to try and get that\ntrench drain into its proper height or elevation.\n    Q.   Was it successful?\n    A.   No, sir.\n    Q.   Let's go to photograph 64 of Exhibit Number\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

You're looking at the start of a CMU wall\nhere.      You're also looking at the corner of the\nfoundation.     Oh, I'm sorry.    No, you're not.   You're\nlook at the end door pocket.        So, this is where we\nfixed in that door pocket 2 and a half feet.\n      Q.     Is that when you first learned that the\nfoundation brick lug did not have a grade beam\nbeneath?\n      A.     This was part of it.    The other part of the\ninvestigation was when we had to go and do our\nadditional concrete for the brick lug around the\npilasters.     The drawings called for 12-inch stone to\nsit there and there was no concrete there for a\n12-inch stone to sit on.\n      Q.     Let's look at 65.   What's that location?\n      A.     You're looking at the same location.    This is\nthe door pockets.\n      Q.     Okay.   And 66?\n      A.     This is the brick lug that I was referring to\nearlier.     The distance from the CMU to the edge of the\nconcrete needs to be 13 inches.        There also needed to\nbe concrete to fill in this area right here.        So, this\nis where we really discovered the void underneath the\n-- the brick lug.\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

You should have grade beam there.\n    Q.   In other words, should concrete run down\nroughly 3 feet below that?\n    A.   It should.\n    Q.   Okay.    Was it that condition all the way\naround the building?\n    A.   All the way around.\n    Q.   67?\n    A.   This is looking down at that same location,\ntaking a measurement of how far back that brick lug\nwas -- or that grade beam.\n    Q.   So, in other words, is that measuring tape up\nagainst the grade beam?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Is it measuring how far out it is to the\nbrick lug?\n    A.   It is.\n    Q.

Let's look at 71 of Exhibit Number 20.\n    A.   This is -- this is showing -- between this\npicture and I believe the next one, you can see where\nthe rebar didn't properly penetrate into the slab and\neither wasn't cast in place or it wasn't drilled and\nepoxied correctly.

You're looking at what I hope is a temporary\nfix on a problem that was encountered.       But\nessentially, this brick lug here should have extended\ndown here in order to accommodate the CMU pilaster\ngoing into the building.\n    Q.   What did they do instead?\n    A.   They threw a piece of CMU down and built on\ntop of it.\n    Q.   How about photograph 73 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.   You're looking at -- essentially, the slab\ndepression was in the wrong location.

And 80 is the actual pour of the concrete?\n    A.   Correct.\n    Q.   What do we see in photograph 81?\n    A.   You're looking at the trench drains.      The\nsystem that was purchased and called for was left\non-site for us to install.     Essentially, we ran into\nan issue to where there were leave-outs left in place\nfor these trench drains to go.      But if you can see\nhere, you've got the slab elevation and then the top\nof the trench drain.     So, naturally, we had to go and\ncut out some concrete in order to install those trench\ndrains to be flush.\n    Q.   What's wrong with that if it's not flush?\n    A.   It won't drain.     You're never going to get\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

I think\nit's easier to see in the next photograph.\n      A.   It is.   You're looking in the opposite\ndirection from inside looking out.       And you can see\nthat if water were to pond here, if you will, there's\nno way for it to escape into that trench drain.\n      Q.   Okay.    Photograph 83 of Exhibit Number 20?\n      A.   You're looking below the doors.\n      Q.   84?\n      A.   You're looking at wiring in the walls.     The\nwiring was the wrong size for the load that the\nbuilding needed to receive.\n      Q.   What about photograph 85 of Exhibit Number\n20?\n      A.   The same thing looking at -- you're looking\nat wiring coming out of the slab that had to be\ndemolished.\n      Q.   Let's look at 86 -- photograph 86 of Exhibit\nNumber 20.\n      A.   Okay.    Essentially, you're looking at conduit\nthat was roughed-in with wire pulled to it.\nTypically, you don't pull wire unless you're\nterminating into something, whether it be a junction\nbox, a panel, a trough, for that matter.      You don't\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Let's change gears and look at the\nphotographs of what you did to address these\nconditions.\n    A.   Sure.\n    Q.   Exhibit Number 21; what is the first picture\nwe see there?\n    A.   Here you're looking at the ridge -- you're\nlooking at a couple things.     So, you've got your\ngutters and downspouts on, you got your corner trim,\nyour eave trim, you've got a fan that was installed in\nthe copula up here.    You're also looking at your ridge\ncap with the proper amount of screws.        You're looking\nat a new roof.    There's really a lot to look at.\n    Q.   Okay.    Do you remember the picture we had\nwith the screws earlier?\n    A.   Uh-huh.\n    Q.   How many more screws did you put on there?\n    A.   A bunch.\n    Q.

You're looking at the corrective action for\nthe end dams.    You're also seeing -- I didn't note\nthis earlier, but you're also seeing a greater amount\nof screws.\n    Q.   We saw photographs earlier where there were\ngaps in those pictures.    Do you remember that?\n    A.   I do.\n    Q.   Is that this same condition?\n    A.   This is at the same location.\n    Q.   That's what I mean.    Is this what you did to\nfix the gaps?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Let's go to 3.\n    A.   You're looking at the same -- same picture of\nlooking up the roof system, but you can see the gap\nhere is greatly reduced.    You can also see the seam in\nthe two roof sheets.\n    Q.   And is Exhibit 21, photograph 4 a similar\nphotograph?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   It doesn't have a gap, does it?\n    A.   That's right.\n    Q.   Photograph 5 of Exhibit 21?\n    A.   You're looking down the -- the cupola line\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

You're looking at gutters installed, flashing\ninstalled, soffits installed, wall panels installed,\nwindows.\n    Q.     How about photograph 6 of 21?\n    A.     You're looking down the -- where the door\npockets are.   Oh, no.      This is just on the main roof.\nExcuse me.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     You're looking down and seeing the new roof\nsystem installed.      And actually, over here, you can\nsee the old roof.\n    Q.     All right.     So, photograph 7?\n    A.     You're looking along the cupola again, seeing\nwall flashing, base flashing, soffits, eave trim,\ngutters, downspouts, windows.\n    Q.     Okay.   How about photograph 8?\n    A.

You can\nnote the substantial difference in clips on the wind\nbracing.   You can also note the -- the angles here\nthat were installed to brace the wall above the CMU.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     And you're looking -- if you want to look\nover here, you can see the door tracks that have been\ncorrected.\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Same thing; you're looking at the wind\nbracing and all the clips.\n       Q.   How about photograph 16 of Exhibit 21?\n       A.   You're looking at wind bracing that's\nconnecting purlins to the beams, essentially creating\na way for those not to roll in conjunction with the\nbending.\n       Q.   Was the wind bracing there when you got\nthere?\n       A.   No, sir.\n       Q.   Did you have to add it or have someone else\nadd it?\n       A.   We had to add it.\n       Q.   Photograph 17 of Exhibit 21?\n       A.   You're looking up at the copula.     Here you\ncan see one of the fans that was purchased -- the fan\nthat was left on-site for us was too big to fit in the\nopening of the copula.        The drawings called for one\nfan.    Unfortunately, because that fan didn't fit, we\nhad to get higher velocity fans and use two of them in\norder to move the same amount of air.\n       Q.   Was -- and it's the brand name, to explain\nthe use of the vulgarity.        But the name of the fan\nthat we see in that picture was a Big Ass Fan;\n\n\n\n                        TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.     But was the one that was supposed to go in\nthe copula a Big Ass Fan?\n    A.     No, sir.    It was just an exhaust fan.    If you\nlook at the size of it, in order to frame that thing\nout, you know, it's a pretty small fan in relation to\nto the Big Ass Fan below.       However, it's meant to\nexhaust jet fumes, plane fumes out of the building.\nThose are a little more comfort oriented.\n    Q.     If the argument has been made in this case\nthat SBS couldn't possibly be responsible for that fan\nbecause they didn't order the Big Ass Fan, is there a\nmistaken assumption in that argument?\n    A.     Well, let's not -- let's not confuse the Big\nAss Fan with the exhaust fans.        There was an exhaust\nfan that was left on-site that was the wrong size.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     That is the fan that had to be replaced which\nmatches the cost allocation that we input into our\nspreadsheet.\n    Q.     Okay.   Let's look at photograph 18 of Exhibit\nNumber 21.\n    A.     Okay.\n    Q.     What do we see there?\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

This is the interior.     There's a\ncouple things you can see here.    You can see the\nbracing on the beams to the -- to the purlins.     You\ncan see all the paneling that's done inside.     You can\nsee all the conduit that we had to re-run.     You can\nsee the light fixtures installed.    You can see Big Ass\nFan installed again.    You can see the other exhaust\nfans on the opposite side of the copula installed\nunder there.\n    Q.   Okay.   If we look at photograph 20 of Exhibit\nNumber 21?\n    A.   You're looking at a -- basically a level up\nagainst the column --\n    Q.   Okay.\n    A.   -- after the building was racked on location.\n    Q.   And if we go to photograph 21?\n    A.   You're looking at us pouring the grade beam\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

What did you have to do to do that?\n    A.   We had to excavate out.      We had to install\npins into the grade beam.     You know, it was a pretty\ndrawn-out process by going back to Victor de Anda and\nhaving him come up with the design; us renting\nequipment; us buying material, labor.        I mean, it was\njust a pretty long drawn-out process.\n    Q.   Was that done to address the fact that the\nbrick lug didn't have the grade beam support below it?\n    A.   That's correct.\n    Q.   So, were you essentially extending the grade\nbeam out?\n    A.   We were.\n    Q.   Let's look at photograph 22 of Exhibit 21.\nIs that the same condition, just looking down the\ngrade beam line?\n    A.   That's correct.     You're seeing the hairpins\nthat were doweled into the existing grade beam and\nthe rebar that was run horizontal to support that\nbeam.\n    Q.   23; is that after the concrete pour?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And what is 24?\n    A.   Same thing, except with the door pockets.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

But were you involved in the submission of\nthose payment applications -- or the payments -- the\napplications for payment for that work and the\napproval of those payments?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    And did you allocate the cost based on your\nunderstanding of the work performed?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.

What you're looking at is essentially\ndraws 3, 4, 5, and 6 of what Robertson billed for.\nSo, they billed for insurance, slab rough-in, light\nfixtures and install, electrical gear equipment and\ninstall.    So, if you're looking at draw 3, you're\nroughly looking at slab rough-in.      Okay.   They\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Light fixtures and installation.\nThere were light fixtures that were left on the site.\nAnd between myself and Bob Carnwath, we inventoried\nand reviewed those light fixtures and we determined\nthat the value of those things were approximately\n$10,000.00.   If you can see a typical markup on light\nfixtures is about 20 percent, bringing you to a value\nof 12,300.\n                Gear and equipment install; there was a\nlittle bit of gear that was left on the site.       Not\nmuch.   What they're billing for in this pay app\nspecifically is $5,120.00 for insurance and\nmobilization.    2,240 in addition to the 12,160 that\nthey had already earned.    So, my assessment was, even\nif they marked up the $10,000.00 in light fixtures at\n20 percent, you know, that 2240 was -- was slightly\nabove reasonable to bill for here.\n                Branch conduit and wire; they're billing\nfor $11,100.00 in conduit and wire.     We valued --\nmyself and Bob valued the amount of conduit and wire\nthat was installed as far as branch circuits was\nroughly $3,000.00.    The temporary power they're\nbilling for here, there was no temporary power to the\nbuilding.    There was no line that was run.   We\nactually had to go in and trench our own line from\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So,\nI'm not quite sure what they were billing for there.\n              If you look at draw 4, you take all\nthose numbers from draw 3 and move them over one\ncolumn to the left.   Light fixture install; they're\nbilling for another $11,200.00.     As we already\ndiscussed, that was excessive for what was provided\non-site or left on-site.    Gear and equipment install;\nthere wasn't anything installed, so I didn't feel like\nthat money should have been allocated to a fair amount\nto pay out.   Branch conduit and wire again; we only\nvalued it at about $3600.00 worth of work completed.\nAnd temporary power, again, for $1250.00.       There was\nno temporary power.\n              Draw 5, demobilization.       I estimate that\n$6,000.00 for demobilizing from Uvalde to San Antonio\nis a little high, so we deducted a thousand dollars\nfrom that and came up with a fair amount of\napproximately 5000.\n    Q.   Okay.   And one more draw.\n    A.   Draw 6.   They drew another $1280.00 for\ninsurance and mobilization.    We got $1150.00 for slab\nrough-in.   There was no contest to that.      2560 in\nlight fixtures and install.    You know, this is\nobviously retainage adjusted to what we felt was\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

We took out\ncompletely because we had no evidence of temporary\npower ever being on-site.\n    Q.     So, the lien amount as reflected in Exhibit\nNumber 62 is $60,990.00.

I'm just\ngoing to look at the amount of their bid compared to\nthe amount of Robertson's bid and see how the\ndifference compares to Mr. Boddie's -- I'm not going\nto ask him anything about C&S other than what's the\namount.\n                THE COURT:    Well, if C&S's contract\namount is 128 --\n                MR.

So, either the contract is written on a\ndifferent set of work or somebody increased the value\non the proposal; right?\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Well, I think -- I think where you may be\nconfused is, you're not seeing any kind of increase on\nhere for changes, so --\n    Q.     Well, that's not true.\n    A.     Look at the date on here, 7/25/13.\n    Q.     7/25/13.\n    A.     Versus the date on the other one.        So, the\nplans changed from 7/25 to whatever the -- Exhibit 44\nwas introduced -- which it's dated January 14th of\n2013.    You're talking about six months of difference\nwhen a building changed pretty substantially.\n    Q.     You agree with me, the contract amount\ndoesn't change?\n    A.     Why would it not?     Your contract amount is an\nabsorption of your original contract plus change\norders.\n    Q.     The contract is what the -- the work you\nagreed to perform is for; right?\n    A.     No.\n    Q.     It's not?\n    A.     So, what you're not understanding and what\nI'm saying is, you can have an original contract\namount and a current contract amount.          You're looking\nat a bill from C&S that has a total contract amount.\nTo me, that says that he's got an original contract\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

I see draw 1, draw 2, draw 3, draw 4, draw 5,\nbalance due.\n    Q.     If you look right below the total contract\namount, the next line says, extras to date.     Do you\nsee that?\n    A.     Sure.\n    Q.     How much is reflected in extras to date?\n    A.     Well, I'm having a real hard time reading\nthat.    I'm going to guess it's either 27 or 37.\n    Q.     It's $87,893.00.\n    A.     Okay.\n    Q.     And it reflects at the bottom line -- the\nnext sentence underneath that says, \"And the total new\ncontract amount is $203,056.00\"; right?\n    A.

And then it indicates that the total new\ncontract amount -- that is the total amount that was\npaid out on this contract -- was $215,256.00.     Do you\nsee that?\n    A.     I do.\n    Q.     That's decisively more than 128,000; wouldn't\nyou agree?\n    A.     128 being Robertson's contract?\n    Q.     That's correct.\n    A.     That's correct.\n    Q.

So, then, there would have been supplies that\nwere no longer necessary; correct?\n    A.   Can you be more specific?\n    Q.   If the plans changed that eliminated\nsomething and he did work on a plan that required it\nand it's no longer required, then that particular item\nwould no longer be required, would it?\n    A.

Well, light fixtures -- if the light fixtures\nwere called to be in one specific location and then\nthat had changed, then it would have to be in a\ndifferent location when you got there; right?\n    A.

I've been a corporate controller for 20 years\nand I've got three years as chief financial officer.\n    Q.   All right.    How long have you been with the\nLewis Group?\n    A.   4 years, 7 months.\n    Q.   Okay.   And what's your current position?\n    A.   Corporate controller.\n    Q.

And I know that they've had a name change,\nbut was that also true back in the 2012/2013 time\nframe?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And what is the relationship between Glacier\nCap and Tri-Bar?\n    A.   They're affiliated companies with common\nowner, Mr. Rod Lewis.\n    Q.   Okay.   How did you become involved in this\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

As the controller for the company, I'm\nresponsible for all invoices -- accounts payable\ninvoices that come in, getting it recorded into our\nsystem, approving them, getting payments out.\n      Q.   All right.     And did that role change over\ntime?\n      A.   No, sir.\n      Q.   Okay.   Did -- did the project and the\ncontractors working on the project change?\n      A.   Yeah.\n      Q.   In other words, what you did for Glacier Cap\nwhile SBS was on the job, how did it transition into\nwhat happened after SBS was terminated?\n      A.   Well, Glacier Cap was the construction\nmanager, which was the liaison between GC and the\nowner, Tri-Bar.    Then in February of 2013, that\nrelationship changed when SBS was terminated as the\nGC.   Glacier Cap Management then assumed the role as\nthe GC until the project's end.\n      Q.   And in your capacity as controller, did your\nresponsibility remain the same to oversee the\ninvoicing and payment of pay applications and things\nof that nature?\n      A.   Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                      PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                         314\n\n\n\n\n    Q.

Are you aware of any other project\nthat has been built during your time there with Mr.\nLewis and his companies where there's been any kind of\nlawsuit filed for some kind of -- some kind of reason\nlike we're here today?\n    A.

Thank you.\n    Q.   (BY MR. JONES)     Mr. Mowrer, what is\nExhibit 19?\n    A.   This is a spreadsheet that was put together\nby Glacier Cap personnel listing invoices,\ncontractors, invoice numbers, and the type of work\nthat had to be done to correct work that was done by\nSBS that was not according to design.\n    Q.   Okay.   And were the invoices actually paid by\nGlacier Cap?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Based upon your review and analysis of the\ninvoices submitted by the various subcontractors\nassociated with this work that's described in\nExhibit 19, what is the total amount that Tri-Bar paid\nto correct or remediate SBS's work?\n    A.   $317,995.74.\n    Q.   I'm going to switch gears again on you.   Did\nGlacier Cap also make payments to -- I'm sorry -- did\nGlacier Cap also make payments to the subcontractors\n-- some of the subcontractors of SBS after they were\nterminated?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And if you would, turn to Exhibit 28 in that\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

Does that consist of the check stubs for at\nleast some of the -- looks like all of the ones that\nGlacier Cap paid?\n    A.   Some of them.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   There's another notebook up there\nthat's called SBS.    Let's look at that one.   Looking\nat Exhibit 23, there's a listing of the -- of the\npayments that were made.     And you can also look at it\non the screen, if you'd like.     The amounts paid\ndirectly by Tri-Bar.     Is that what actually was paid\nby Tri-Bar?\n    A.   Looks like it.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   And why were -- why did you authorize\n-- or why did someone authorize and direct you to pay\nthese invoices for subcontractors that were working\nwhile SBS was on the property?\n    A.   Well, the general manager at the time that\nwas working for us worked with the subcontractors to\ncontinue the construction of the project.    So, when\nSBS was terminated, we worked with a subcontractor to\nsee if they would still continue the project so we\ncould get the project done in a timely manner, and\nthey agreed.   So, we just made direct payment to them.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And did you also obtain lien releases\nfrom those subcontractors?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   I know it's tempting, but you need to\nwait for me to finish my question.\n    A.   Okay.\n    Q.   You know what I'm going to say, but the court\nreporter has a hard time taking down two people\ntalking at once.    And would that be shown in\nExhibit 29 in the SBS notebook -- I'm sorry -- the\nTri-Bar notebook?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   I'm going to take this notebook away\nfrom you for a minute so you don't have to worry about\nthat one.   I'm going to change over to now the pay\napplication process that was used for Tri-Bar.    And\nI'd like for you to take a look at tab 1 -- or\nExhibit 1 in that notebook.\n    A.   (Witness complying.)\n    Q.   As a preliminary matter, you're familiar with\nthe hangar project being basically a million two\nstarting out?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.

A little bit less than six months, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    And did it have a specific number\nof days -- 173 days?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   And looking at draw request number 1,\nthat was paid; correct?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And now, if you look at Exhibit 2, that's\nanother -- another SBS payment application.   Was that\nalso paid?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   So, roughly after two months, you had -- or\nTri-Bar has paid approximately $200,000.00?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    And turning now to pay app number\n3, what is the amount of that pay app?\n    A.   The work completed for that period was\n$31,000.00.\n    Q.   Did that -- as a controller of a project that\nhas a timeline, did that concern you?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Why?\n    A.   Well, the project was $1.2 million, which\nshould have been done over a period of six months -- a\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

So, for cash\nbudgeting, you're looking at about $200,000.00 per\nmonth.    And after the first two months, we only saw\n$200,000.00 in progress billings.     We expected to see\n4.   And after this third pay app, this was only\n$31,000.00.   So, we were only at $231,000.00 in\nprogressive billings when we expected to be up to\nabout $600,000.00.\n     Q.    And did you -- were you, in fact, instructed\nto hold on to this pay app for a while to see if any\nwork was going to be done?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    All right.   Now, turn to pay app number 4\nthat is dated, I believe, October 31st; is that\ncorrect?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    All right.   So, that covered work that was\nsupposed to be done during the month of October?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    Well, let me back up just for a second to pay\napp 3.    If you'll turn with me to tab 36 -- or\nExhibit 36, that is a letter from Mr. Grable in\nconnection with pay app 3; is that correct?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    All right.

And what does he -- what does Mr. Grable say\nin paragraph 3 of that letter dated October 5th, 2012?\n    A.    \"SBS stated still on target for main steel\nframe delivery to site on October 15th, 2012.      This\nmatches current updated schedule.       Erection will begin\nthe same week of delivery.\"\n    Q.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.    What is the amount of that pay app?\n    A.    $3,541.66.\n    Q.    And what month are we in now?\n    A.

So, that's how many months from inception of\nconstruction?\n    A.    That's four months.\n    Q.    All right.    Did this concern you, that you\nwere receiving an invoice for only $3,541.66 in month\nfour of this project?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Why?\n    A.    Total pay apps for four months only\naccumulated to about 240 or $250,000.00.        After four\nmonths, I would expect it to be about $800,00.00 into\nthe contract by now.     So, that was substantially\nbehind.\n    Q.    Mr. Mowrer, let me show you what has been\nmarked as Exhibit 71, Tri-Bar.      What is that, sir?\n    A.

(BY MR. JONES)     There's been some talk in\nthis trial about Mr. Lewis issuing a stop payment\nedict in October.      Make no more payments to this\ncompany until we see something going on.        And we knew\nnothing about it.      Nobody told SBS.    Nobody told\nanybody.   Pittman never told us.       Nobody ever told us.\nIs that true?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     What does Exhibit 71 show?\n    A.     It's a letter dated November 10th, 2012.        And\nit states in here that the owner is holding back draws\nuntil SBS can deliver PEMB as scheduled, and cc SBS\nconstruction Jack Green.\n    Q.     Okay.   Well, Mr. Grable approved the draw\napplication, so why is the owner holding it?\n    A.     Well, the -- at this point the work was\ncompleted, but they were still way behind schedule.\nSo, we were just holding off the payment until they\nwould get substantially caught up with some work.          And\nat this point, at 11/10 when this letter was dated, we\nstill had not even received the metal for the erection\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

The bulk of the pay application was for the\nmetal that was delivered to the site.\n       Q.   Okay.   And so, I believe this pay app was\nactually paid in January.      Does that sound familiar to\nyou?\n       A.   Yes, sir.\n       Q.   As well as 3 and 4?\n       A.   Yes, sir.\n       Q.   Why were those pay apps now paid in January\nof 2013 after the delays?\n       A.   We were waiting for substantial completion of\nSBS to correct the metal structure.       So, once it was\ndelivered there, then they started working on erecting\nit.    And at that point we were willing to go to\npayment in January.\n       Q.

Why?\n    A.   The GC, SBS, was terminated as the GC.     And\nalso the work that was done was considered substandard\nand not to the design that was specified.\n    Q.   And when did this pay app come in?\n    A.   This pay app would have crossed my desk\nsomewhere -- period ending December 31st, 2012.    So, I\nwould have got it probably mid to late January --\nprobably mid-January I would have gotten it.\n    Q.

Mr. Mowrer, did I hear you say a minute ago\nthat the reason that you were withholding -- or that\nthe payment was being withheld on the contract is you\nwere waiting for substantial completion?     Did I hear\nyou right?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.    You said you've had a chance to review\nthis contract.    Tell me, where in the contract did\nTri-Bar and SBS -- where does it provide for that\npayment is dependent upon substantial completion of\nthe drawings?\n    A.

Because\n-- because he puts them on notice for doing what it\nappears, and I believe the evidence supports, is the\npattern and practice of Tri-Bar.     They want something\nfor nothing.

They say\nit's too high.    Well, they never said what they think\nit should be.    They just keep saying it's too high.\nAnd so, he's working.    And then we get -- during the\nentire scope and course of this trial, we've had at\nleast six, if not seven, alleged reasons for his\ntermination.    One was during the scope of this matter\n-- it was because his billing practice was supposedly\nstrange.    The Court heard the arguments here in our\nmotion for summary judgment.    That's what they said.\nNot one shred of evidence about it.     Not one.\n                The next was, well, it's just he didn't\nman it.    But when Pittman, who I must admit, I've\nwanted to get at Pittman for at least two years.       It\nwas somewhat refreshing and somewhat disappointing at\nthe same time to get to talk to him.        Because he makes\nno sense.    He's certainly not honest.     And the reality\nhere is, what he says is, well, I had all these\nconcerns about Robertson Electric.     They didn't man\nappropriately.    They didn't man in November.     He was\nshocked to find out my client wasn't even there in\nNovember.    Didn't have to be there in November.     So,\nhe was engaged in fabrication.     That's what he was\ndoing; just fabricating.    He was engaged in the\nprocess of locating other subcontractors to include\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Well, at this point\nin the game, we don't even know what work they were\ndoing, and we really don't know what it is that was\nsupposed to be done cheaper, allegedly.     We do know\nthat their contract was priced $30,000.00 more than\nwhat they proposed to do it for.     We do know that on\ntop of that, when it ends up, the entire cost of their\ncontract is 215,000 plus.    But some of that is\nunderstood because the real reality is that Rod Lewis\nis engaged in a habit of the constant re-change,\nre-adoption of the work site.    And that happened.\n               But the reality is, what was left out of\nwhat they proposed my client identified.     And that is,\nin his change orders he identified the work that had\nto be done.    And when he looked at the work that they\nproposed had to be done in the proposal, he looked and\ncould identify, these are the things that aren't being\nidentified.    These are the things that have to be\ndone.\n               What they then do and what Tri-Bar does\nis they get Mr. Boddie.    And Mr. Boddie wants to come\nacross as neutral and wants to come across as a, quote\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

His sole\nobjective was to try and fabricate information.        But\nthe reality is, when asked, what did you consider,\nwell, in one instance, well, I didn't investigate\nthat.   I just thought.   You're making recommendations\nthat you consider, but you're not showing that you\nconsidered anything.    You don't know where he lives,\nso you don't know where he demobilizes to.       You don't\nknow what anything is.    What did you consider?       Did\nyou look at the contracts?    What was supposed to be\ndone?   He was evasive.   Why?   Because he wasn't up\nthere to really assist this Court and give expert\ninformation, to guide the Court or to guide the\nfactfinder as to what may very well be.       He was there\nto present the side of Tri-Bar.     And the side of\nTri-Bar is just fiction, if nothing else.\n                The scope of their argument is this:\nEverybody else is to abide by the contract but them.\nEvery witness that they put up there -- did you see\nour contract?    Did you see what you're supposed to do?\nThis is what you're supposed to do.      This is how\nyou're supposed to do it.    But it's their contract.\nThey're supposed to know it better than anybody else.\nAnd they didn't abide by it at all.\n                And so, their saving grace really is\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

That's\ntheir argument.   But my client abided by this\ncontract.   He documented.   He followed it.    He did\neverything he was supposed to do.     He worked.   And\nwhat they want to say is, well, now there's some\nthings that he did wrong.    Things that they never --\nlet's assume for the moment that what they're saying\nis true.    Let's assume he did some things wrong.     You\nnever tell him?   You're so concerned about something\nbeing done right that you don't alert somebody to,\nokay, possibly something was done wrong?\n               Our contention and my client's position\nsaid, no, he didn't do anything wrong.      He took\npictures of the site when he left it.       He followed the\ncontract -- the original plan to the letter.       And when\nhe was terminated, he made it a point to say, tell me\nwhat I did, if I did anything.     Contacts SBS; what did\nI do?   Initially, there's no response.     But they\neventually tell him, you did nothing wrong.      He gets a\ncall and they tell him the reason -- real reason they\nwant you gone is because they want to go with somebody\nelse.\n               Well, we now know that that was in\nprogress, at a minimum, since October.      But we know\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

They never\naccount for the fact that they didn't trench.      They\nnever account for the fact they didn't permit.      They\nnever account for the fact that they're the cause of\nany alleged delay that my client had.       And the -- the\ntestimony uncontroverted from SBS is that, at a\nminimum, he's on progress.    He's where he's supposed\nto be.   From my client, says, I was ahead of where I\nwas supposed to be.    I was waiting for work.    And on\nthat, he sends out an e-mail and says, hey, I'm being\nheld up.    I need -- these things are the things\nholding me up.    Let me know when it can be corrected,\nso I can get it done.    As far as documentation is\nconcerned, again, he's the one that did it.\n                So, we have established a breach of\ncontract.   And we've established there's been tortious\ninterference.    In order for Tri-Bar to establish their\nposition of justification, what they have got to show\n-- because it's their burden -- is that that -- not\njust that -- they state, well, we had a superior\nright.   We had a superior interest.    You can state you\ncan fly.    You've got to prove you can.\n                And the reality is, that definitely\ndidn't happen with Mr. Pittman.     Because Mr. Pittman\ncould not establish any of the things that they allege\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

The right arises from their contract to\ndo whatever it is they're going to do and whatever it\nis they're going to assert.    Their contract expressly\nsays that there is no flow-down provision and there is\nno contractual obligation established.      That's what\ntheir contract says.    It also says that in order for\nthem to assert themselves into it, there's\ndocumentation that they're required to do.     There are\nnotices.\n                Well, if there are legitimate problems --\nand I think there certainly was some concerns -- why\ndon't they just put it in writing?     They sent all\nthese e-mails, so it's not like it wasn't possible for\nthem to write.    Why didn't they?   Because that wasn't\ntheir real concern.    Their real concern, when you look\nthrough their correspondence, is they wanted to screw\nover SBS.   And they didn't care who they hurt in the\nprocess.    They wanted to reassume, for whatever\nreason, and that's what's in their e-mails.     It's not\nanything I'm manufacturing.    It's what they write.\n                They hurt my client, who was innocent,\nin the progress.    And then they try to come up with\nall these alleged matters.    They are really saying, on\none issue, to give them, again, the benefit of their\nargument that basically 3,000 or $4,000.00 worth of\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Really, that's their\n-- that's their position on that.    And their position\nis, well, because of a change order that you told us\nabout -- we didn't tell you about; you told us\nabout -- that you're pricing it too high.    They never\ntell anybody it's being priced too high until they get\nin a phone conversation with Mr. Green or Mr.\nSchiffman.   And they don't put that in writing.\n              They say that we're motivated by economic\ninterest because C&S Enterprises can perform the\nduties cheaper.   You can't tell it by the cost.    You\ncan't tell it by the items they left out.    And there's\nsome question as to whether we are talking apples and\noranges, because of the constant state of flux of the\nwork that needed to be done.   Even in their last\nexhibit, the exhibit dealing with the change from a\none level to two level was a change between\ninformation in less than a month.    Because if you take\nhis testimony as true, then on January 23rd, this\nthing is one level.   By February 15th, it's\nconstructed to be two level.\n              So, I don't know.

The Defendant's\nposition is, just because we said it, just because he\nhad an alleged good faith belief.       Good faith is\nestablished by character and it's got to be assessed.\nYou look at that.    And he wasn't honest.       And it's\njust that simple.\n             THE COURT:      Let me ask you this.      What\nare your causes of action against the Defendant?\n             MR.

Tri-Bar.\n             MR. BROWN:      We actually have two.      But\nthey -- they spring out.     The first -- the tortious\ninterference is definitely against Tri-Bar.\n             THE COURT:      Uh-huh.\n             MR. BROWN:      The other springs out because\nof the conduct that occurs during the course.          And\nthat is, their contract expressly provides that they\ncould have assumed control over the subcontractor.\nAnd they do that by putting it in writing and notice.\nThey could have done it.     They didn't.    But it's clear\nthat's what they did.     They -- Mr. Pittman terminates\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

They assumed\nthat role.   They replaced the subcontractor.      And they\nhad that right only after they tortiously interfered.\nThat's when it sprang out.    That's when it occurred.\n               Before then, they could not have done\nwhat they did.    But after which, because the way their\ncontract is structured, is when it does occur.      And a\nthat is why we believe that there is an oral contract\nthat establishes at that point the existence of an\nobligation that they owed to Robertson Electric for\nperformance.   So, there are two --\n               THE COURT:   A contractual obligation by\nthem terminating SBS and then stepping in as --\n               MR. BROWN:   Not terminating SBS.    Because\nat the point that they terminate --\n               THE COURT:   SBS.\n               MR.

They're terminated on\nFebruary 5th.\n                THE COURT:    Uh-huh.\n                MR. BROWN:    So, the obligation at that\npoint, pursuant to their own contract is, they could\nhave assumed the authority to step in and act.         But\nthere was a provision that they had to obtain the\narchitectural certification, they had to give the\nrequisite notice, and then they could have done it,\nunder their own contract.      They didn't.    But I believe\nthe Court, in equity, has the right to assume or can\ntake charge of the fact that that's what they did do\nand deal with the reality of the situation.\n                And so, those are the two theories that\nwe have.    Again, there's no question they tortiously\ninterfered.   The issue -- the other, again, occurs\nafter the tortious interference.        And again, I\nresearched that point.       Both can occur.   We're only\nentitled to one relief.      We're only entitled to one\njudgment.

There's a section where -- first and foremost,\nwith regard to their right to change the work, they\ndon't comply with.   At 14.2.2, they have to obtain\ncertification -- if it's -- they're going to go for\ncause, then they would have to obtain a certification\nby the initial decision maker.      After that, then they\nhave to give the requisite notice to SBS of seven\ndays, which does not flow.\n               The next thing is, under the owner's\nright to stop work, which is 2.3, and then the owner's\nright to carry out the work, which is 2.4; that is\nwhere it states that if the -- if the contractor here\ndefaults or neglects to carry out the work, then after\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And that is,\nin essence, what Pittman testified to.       That's what he\nsaid.    That's what he did.    That's why he did what he\ndid.\n                And so, it is at that point that the\ncontract, at least the oral contract and their\nassumption into that right and into that role takes\nplace.   But again, it occurs after they engaged in a\ntortious interference.       So, our position --\n                THE COURT:    You're saying that they took\n-- the tortious interference began -- what you're\nsaying is -- rolling down the hill -- where they told\nSBS, you get rid of Robertson or you're gone?\n                MR.

Is Pittman being agent for\nthe owner?\n                MR. BROWN:    No.   They take --\n                THE COURT:    No?\n                MR.

We kind of\nhave to start there.    Your Honor, I'm going to be\ntalking about Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1 and\nPlaintiff's Exhibit Number 17.     I'm going to start\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

I'm going to\ngo through it right quick.    Was it a termination for\n-- for cause?    And I think the answer is no,\nestablished by the evidence, established straight out\nof Mr. Grable's mouth.    Because under 14.2.2, the\nwording here is crucial.    That the owner may terminate\nthe contract if one of four conditions exist.      Mr.\nPittman tried to claim that number 1 was the one that\nexisted; that it repeatedly refuses or fails to supply\nenough proper skilled workers or proper materials.\n14.2.2 says when any of these conditions exist, and\nMr. Pittman said it existed, then upon certification\nby the initial decision maker, Grable, and sufficient\ncause exists to justify such action, then we get to\nthe next part.\n                But let's just stop right there.   Because\nI asked Mr. Grable, did you send the notice; he said\nno.   Ms. Brazell actually asked Mr. Grable, did you\nsend -- were you instructed by Mr. Pittman, the\nowner's representative, to say that there were not\nenough workers out there; and he said, yeah, I was\ninstructed to do that.    Why didn't you send the 72\nnotice?   Because I felt we could get it worked out;\nthat we had gotten past these issues.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           357\n\n\n\n\n                So, not only did Mr. Grable, the initial\ndecision maker, not issue the certification; he\nrefused to issue the certification and didn't.       Not\njust accidently or negligently, which actually is what\nI thought was going to happen when we came in here.\nBut on purpose because he thought we had gotten past\nthe issue.   And that was a request from the owner as\nan owner's directive.\n                Now, if you look at that -- the rest of\nthat clause, it says, then they also have to give the\ncontractor seven days notice.        We know that didn't\nhappen either.    The words mean something that there\nare two conditions that must be met and neither one of\nthem got met.    Now, what's kind of interesting about\nthis is --\n                THE COURT:   Who's the decision maker?\n                MR. CLARK:   The initial decision maker is\nthe architect.\n                THE COURT:   Architect?     Okay.\n                MR. CLARK:   And that's in the contract\ndocuments.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.\n                MR. CLARK:   So, the initial decision\nmaker is the architect, Mr. Grable.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.    I remember that.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So, the -- what's\ninteresting about this provision, 14.2.2, is that what\nthe owner may do in this paragraph is not terminate\nthe contract right here.   It says that the owner may\n-- after they do those -- if they get the\ncertification and give the notice, they may terminate\nemployment of the contractor and may -- and then\nthere's three things they can do; finish the work,\ncollect for damages, and recover costs in excess of\nthe contract price.   Then the contract terminates.\n              Contrast that -- let's compare -- when\nyou look at the termination for convenience.    Your\nHonor, here is the termination for convenience clause\non the next page, the 14.2.1.\n              THE COURT:   But still as factfinder, the\nCourt considers whether they had cause under 14.2.1;\nright?   The -- repeatedly refuses or fails to supply\nenough properly skilled workers.\n              MR. CLARK:   Correct.   They -- I didn't --\nI was not even going to get to that issue, but\nobviously they have to have proven that first.    And I\nthink there was contradictory evidence as to whether\nwe had -- as to whether SBS had repeatedly refused to\nput skilled workers out there.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

CLARK:    It is.    It is.   But then for\nthe termination for cause, then you have to have those\nother two conditions as well.\n               THE COURT:    Right.    But you say it's for\nconvenience because they found a better supplier?\n               MR. CLARK:    It doesn't matter what reason\nthey had.    They could have just not liked Mr.\nSchiffman.   They could have just not liked the answers\nthey were getting.    They could have just not liked\nanything about SBS.    Mr. Lewis could have just gotten\nup and said, I don't like the color of their shirts.\nAnd a termination for convenience requires absolutely\nno reason at all.\n               THE COURT:    Right.\n               MR. CLARK:    Zero.    Which is why that is\nnot a breach if he --\n               THE COURT:    But the facts you developed\nwas, they found a cheaper price or whatever.\n               MR. CLARK:    It was.   I like to find a\nmotivation in people and not believe that they do\nthings willy-nilly.    But it really doesn't matter why\nhe did it.   It was just done.\n               THE COURT:    No, I understand.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

CLARK:    And so, he can terminate the\ncontract at any time for convenience without cause.\nNow, in that case, it's not terminate the employment\nof the contract.    In 14.4.1, it's terminate the\ncontract for the owner's convenience.        And when that\nhappens, the contractor is given no rights.        The\ncontractor says, cease operations.      Don't bill\nanymore.    Don't incur any more costs.      And then the\nremedy -- there's one remedy, and it's in 14.4.3.          The\ncontractor shall be entitled to receive payment for\nwork executed, costs incurred by reason of\ntermination, along with reasonable overhead profit and\nwork not executed.    That's it.    So, under a\ntermination for convenience, it's a termination of the\ncontract.    And a termination of the contract is like\nbeing dead.   You either are or you aren't and the\ncontract is dead.\n               And so, when the owner terminated the\ncontract, the contractor, SBS, had nothing else to do.\nWe offered to do some stuff.     But we didn't have any\nmore obligations under the contract.         At the same\ntime, they didn't have any more rights under the\ncontract.    When you terminate it, it's terminated.\nIt's done.    There's no other clauses in that 14.4.        If\nyou look back in 14.2, Your Honor, you'll see that\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Okay.    Those aren't -- those words are not\npresent over in the termination for convenience.      They\nare present if it's a termination for cause.\n                 THE COURT:   Yes, sir.\n                 MR. CLARK:   And the same thing was kind\nof true with -- if you look in 14.4.3, the termination\nfor convenience when it says they get payment; it\ndoesn't say except as provided elsewhere.      It doesn't\nsay without prejudice to the rights of others.      It\ndoesn't say subject to this section or that section or\nsomething else.     Like it does under the termination\nfor cause.   And Mr. Slates got up in his opening\nstatement and said, you remember how this fits under\nparagraph 12 of the AIA contract, where it talks about\nprior to substantial completion X, Y, and Z, and the\nowner can do this, that, and the other.      X, Y, and Z\ntalks about substantial completion; before or after\nsubstantial completion.       It doesn't say, if we find\nsomething after termination, then we can do this.        The\nonly thing that talks about what happens after\ntermination is if there's a termination for cause.         If\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

It's over.   It's done\nwith.   You have to add words to the contract in order\nto get where Mr. Slates wants to go.\n               Not to mention, under 14.2.4, which is\nthe termination for cause; if you look down at the\nvery bottom of what happens at the very end when we're\nat today's point.    14.2.4 says that two things are\nsupposed to happen.    The contractor is supposed to\nsubmit a final pay application to the architect.       We\ndid it.    Mr. Grable got -- the documents are in\nevidence.    We delivered them to Mr. Grable.   Mr.\nGrable admitted he got our pay applications 7, 8, and\n9.   Then the owner is to submit any costs that he has\nunder that termination to the architect.      And it\nsays -- the very last sentence says, the amount to be\npaid shall be certified by the architect, the initial\ndecision maker, upon application.      And this obligation\nshall survive termination of the contract.\n               So, even if this was a termination for\ncause, our application is in Mr. Grable's pocket.\nThey never put on any evidence at all that they put\ntheir application in front of Mr. Grable.     Mr. Grable\nis not a Tri-Bar employee.     He's not with Glacier\nCapital.    The fact that they have a document that Mr.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                    PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            363\n\n\n\n\nMowrer created or Ms. Swisher created or whoever that\nhas numbers on it doesn't put it in Mr. Grable's\nhands.   14.2.4 says it's got to be in Mr. Grable's\nhands.   And that obligation shall survive termination\nof the contract.\n              So, whether it's termination for cause,\nthey didn't comply with the elements and put their\nnumbers in front of Mr. Grable.     And if it was a\ntermination for convenience, then there's nothing that\ngives them the right to an offset.\n              So, what happened in this case?       I think\nwhat happened in this case was that the termination\nwas done as a matter of convenience.        I think Mr.\nPittman kind of flew off the handle and just said,\nfire them, get rid of them, and made it happen.       I\ndon't think they went back to the attorneys again to\ndo it -- to do it right.    I think they could have done\nit right, but they didn't do it right.\n              And then after the fact, when Mr.\nSchiffman and Mr. Morgan didn't just go off into the\nnight and eat their loss, that's when Mr. Pittman came\nback and said, I'm going to crush them.       And now the\nprices escalate.   But you heard Mr. Pittman.      He said\nhe was out there all the time.     Whether he was or\nwasn't, I don't know.    He said he knows as much and is\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But as\nsoon as SBS is gone and he walks the property, all of\na sudden, they're obvious.    You can see the building\nleaning from left to right.   One of those two things\nisn't right.   And so, either Mr. Pittman wasn't doing\nhis job before, and then just started to do his job\nafter the termination, or he was doing his job all\nalong and knew that this is how construction projects\nlook at this particular stage of the -- of the\nconstruction and didn't have any problems with it\nuntil he decided to issue the termination.\n               And you heard Erick Key from Schulte come\nin.   He does metal buildings all the time.    He's\nfamiliar with the roof system that SBS -- that SBS\nputs on.   He looked at every one of those -- most of\nthose pictures and said, yeah, those are temporary.\nThose are not the finished product.

I\nthink the best description came in one of the e-mails.\nIt was actually an e-mail that Mr. Boddie wrote.        It's\nExhibit 71.   Where he said it appears the problems\nwere the result of miscommunication.        I think that's\nan understatement.    We have people talking past each\nother and nobody knew exactly what they were supposed\nto be doing because we had plans going back and forth\nand I don't think anybody was communicating.         They\nwere talking, but they weren't communicating.\n                There were obviously multiple reasons why\nthe project was delayed.    And was there fault on both\nsides?   I think absolutely there was.      I think we have\npeople that are holding payment.     People that knew the\nconcrete needed to get paid.    People that could have\npaid the concrete people.    People that were standing\non principle.    And I think a lot of egos got in the\nway here and things didn't gel.\n                But were the delays a big issue?      No.\nMr. Morgan said in paragraph 4.3 when they got to the\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Yes.\nThey all had notice issues.    They all could have -- we\ncould have stopped work.    They could have terminated\nus.   They could have suspended work.       Everybody could\nhave -- could have done something or should have done\nsomething or would have done something if, if, if.\nWhat happened was what we've got.     And that was,\neverybody kind of kept moving along.        And as Mr.\nGrable said, they tried to get past the issue.       And\nso, you get down to the point where you end up with a\ntermination that has to be for convenience because the\ncause elements don't exist.\n               Was it a great business decision for Mr.\nLewis?   No.   He -- we have a guaranteed maximum\ncontract; $1.2 million.    If he really spent\n$4 million, as was suggested -- and I don't think the\nnumbers add up that high.    I think it's more like 1.8.\nBut if he really spent $1.8 million to get this\nproject done, he really should have stuck with SBS\nbecause we were going to end up having to finish it\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                          367\n\n\n\n\nfor $1.2 million.    So, the damages that he incurred\nwere brought on by himself.     He had us under contract.\nAnd he had us with a guaranteed maximum.      No matter\nwhat we were billing, we were going to be stuck with\nit.   We were going to be doing work for free.\n                Now, as to Robertson; did SBS breach the\ncontract with Robertson?     We terminated.   We didn't\nhave a right.    I think the answer is yes.   We really\nhaven't contested that at all ever since the beginning\nof this case.    We've always told them that it was at\nTri-Bar's instructions.     You know, I found it kind of\nhumorous when Mr. Slates asked his question of Mr.\nRobertson and said, now did SBS give you written\nnotice of this termination?     No.   Did you know that\nSBS is complaining about lack of written notice about\nus?   Yeah.   But the difference is, we admit that we\nbreached the contract with Robertson because we didn't\ngive him notice.    We could have gone through and found\nsomething or made up a reason.      We just did what we\nwere told.    Theirs is the same way.    They didn't give\nus notice.    That's a breach of contract or it's a\ntermination for convenience.\n                One of the questions I have that -- that\nMr. Brown did not raise is, in Exhibit 68 that they\nthrew up here on the last day, they go through and\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And we've gone through and done all\nthese offsets and we show that in -- that by our\ncalculations, he's only owed 12.     And that was in\nMarch of 2013.    We're now in March of 2015.   Why in\nthe world, if you admit that you owe him $12,000.00,\ndid you not send him a check for $12,000.00?    Doesn't\nhave to have a lien release.    Doesn't have to have\nanything else.    If you owe him the $12,000.00, send\nhim the $12,000.00.    We'll fight over the difference.\nI can't answer that question.    I think it's a -- I\nthink they should have done that.\n                In our contract with Robertson; do we owe\nhim $869,000.00?    No.   We have a pay-when-paid clause.\nAnd obviously, the owner was holding payments in part\nbecause of something Robertson did, so there's nothing\nwrong with the way that we have the clause written.\nHow much is Robertson owed for the breach of contract?\nWe have an exclusive remedy provision that has the\ndamage numbers in it.     And he's owed for the work and\nmaterial that he had out there on site.     He billed us\n$54,996.00.   That's what we've included in all of our\napplications.    That's what we think we are required to\npay him, if and when we recover from Tri-Bar.    If we\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

CLARK:    996.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. CLARK:    There was an additional\n$6,000.00 that he had for demobilization cost.     But\nthe demobilization is a consequential damage.    And\nunder 11.04 of our contract with Mr. Robertson, he's\nnot entitled to get consequential damages from us.\nMight the $6,000.00 be something that he could recover\nas tortious interference damages from Tri-Bar?     Yes.\nThat would fit legally under that.     So -- but as far\nas the measure of damages, Mr. Robertson said that the\ncost to complete by C&S was the same or more than his\ncontract amount.   And looking at the measure of\ndamages, he's then not entitled to any extra damages\nfrom SBS.\n              On attorney's fees, when you get Mr.\nBrown's application for attorney's fees and you see\nmine, you'll see that when it comes to segregation of\nattorney's fees, you'll see that the bulk of Mr.\nBrown's time was spent on his issues with Tri-Bar; not\nSBS.   You'll see that the motions to compel discovery\nthat he was talking about were not filed against SBS.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           370\n\n\n\n\nWhen he sent us requests for production of documents,\nwe answered every single one of them without a single\nobjection.   So, I would say that maybe 10, 15 percent\nof Mr. Brown's total attorney's fees would be\nattributable to the SBS breach of contract.      But we'll\nput those in the affidavits.\n                As it relates to Tri-Bar and our damages,\nI think -- I mean, 14.4 just doesn't have any\nexceptions to it.    It says that we get -- shall be\nentitled to payment for work executed.       And I think\nthat's an interesting and great place to make the\npoint that it doesn't say payment for work completed.\nIt says payment for work executed.      Because the idea\nbehind a termination for convenience is that it was\nterminated before it was finished.      And as Mr. Boddie\nsaid, this project was 60, 65 percent completed at\nbest.   We have costs incurred by reason of\ntermination, which we have none.      And then we have --\nalong with reasonable overhead and profit on the work\nnot executed.    So, we've proven up on the payments for\nthe work not executed, which includes Mr. Robertson's\nwork, however it's valued, was the $304,000.00 that's\nin Exhibit Number 23.     All of our numbers are right\nout of Exhibit Number 23.     The profit is defined in\nthe -- in the primary contract to be the contractor's\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

That's what that calculation\nis at the bottom.    You take the work not done yet and\nyou apply 8 percent, that's the $32,000.00 profit.\n               On the prejudgment interest, we have sued\nunder the Prompt Pay Act.     And so, prejudgment\ninterest is going to be statutory and not contractual.\nWe can worry about that post judgment if -- if the\nneed be.    As to our attorney's fees, I incurred almost\nnothing in relation to the claim involving Mr.\nRobertson and his claim.     Almost all of my fees were\nin connection with the claims raised by Tri-Bar.        And\nso, I'll be seeking the majority of my fees, which are\nabout $95,000.00, from Tri-Bar for their breach of\ncontract.\n               And I would close with -- you know,\nthere's a lot of people out there that have not been\npaid that did work on that project.        And I'll close\nwith -- from Exhibit 8 with Mr. Grable's words.         It's\nnot right in my mind to tool around with the working\nman's paycheck.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.   Thank you.

We know\nthat there were schedule problems on this project.         We\nknow from Exhibit Number 32 and lots of testimony that\nthey missed their original deadline, they missed their\nrevised deadline, and they missed their third deadline\non delivering the building.     But we also know that --\nthat Erick Key, the gentleman from Schulte, according\nto him, he was telling them, you know, I can't meet\nthis schedule.    I'm too busy.   I can't do this.    But\nthat never makes its way to us.     Instead, it's, we'll\nhave it to you in three weeks, we'll have it to you in\nfive weeks, we'll have it to you by October 15th.      But\nthat never happened.    So, apparently they weren't\ntelling us what Schulte Building Systems was telling\nthem.\n                And this pattern of -- of not being\nupfront and honest continues throughout the case.\nYou've got the situation with the brick lug, where\nthey moved the forms out to create the brick lug\nwithout telling anybody.      Now, Jack Green says that he\ntold John Grable and Victor de Anda that, but they\nboth categorically deny that fact.     Then with respect\nto the field modification issues that come up.       You\nhave the wind bents where, yeah, okay, they're moving\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But in response to that issue\nbeing raised, in Exhibit Number 55 of SBS, Steve\nSchiffman makes a firm commitment that he will not\nmake and will not allow any other field modifications\nto be made without giving notice to the owner and\ngetting approval.    But then we find out after the\nfact, they didn't just move some poles around.     They\ncut a building down so that it would fit on a\nfoundation.\n               And this -- this pattern of misleading\nTri-Bar wasn't just on the project.      It's been in this\ncase, too.    We were told that they had a\nsuperintendent on site every day and that they weren't\nallowed to work on weekends.     But then when I\ncross-examined Kyle Kieke, we found out that wasn't\ntrue.   We were told -- we've already talked about the\ntestimony about the brick lug, which is controverted\nby Mr. Grable and Mr. De Anda.      We were told that they\nwere going to show that the building was in tolerance.\nWhen Mr. Key got up here, I think we got a little\nsurprise and found out that, in fact, it was out of\ntolerance; that the tolerance was 1/16 inch per floor,\nnot the 4 inches per floor that had been represented.\n               We've been told that they didn't know --\nthat this whole idea of the -- the decision to\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

For the past three\ndays, that's what they've said.      But you just found\nout in the past few hours that that's not true.        That\nMr. Grable had said in November, we're holding pay\napplications until we get the building delivered.       And\nbuilding delivered doesn't just mean the material\nthere.   It means erected.\n               THE COURT:    Does it say erected?\n               MR. SLATES:   No, it doesn't.   But I\nthink --\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:   -- I think the term\ndelivered -- the building delivered is somewhat\nambiguous.   It could mean the material only.       But I\nthink what they were looking for was --\n               THE COURT:    If I get the building\ndelivered, then I can start working on it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Yeah.   I think the idea was,\nwe want to see real progress.\n               THE COURT:    Start working on it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Yeah.   And then lastly, with\nrespect to Robertson, he was adamant that nobody ever\ntold him that the owner thought the number was too\nhigh.

But then we\nlooked at his affidavit from the motion for summary\njudgment, where he clearly said, SBS told me that the\nowner wasn't happy with my number.\n               And so, the misleading information has\ncontinued.   I want to talk about breaches.      And we'll\nget to the termination issue in just a minute.       But\nfirst of all, let's look at some of the other\nbreaches.    3.8 says you're supposed to have a\nsuperintendent on site at all times.        We know that\ndidn't happen.   7.8.1 says you're supposed to provide\nnotice to the owner if you're going to do business\nwith a related entity.    We know that didn't happen.\n3.10.3 says you're supposed to meet your current\nschedules.   We've seen two schedules that have been\nsupplied in this case.    They didn't meet either one of\nthem.   3.12.5 through 3.12.8 are the provisions that\nrequire them to review the shop drawings and to\nidentify discrepancies and report those to the owner.\nThey didn't do that.    3.2.2 is the section that says\nif you know of an inconsistency that exists, you need\nto submit an RFI and get guidance.     The field modified\nthe building without ever notifying the owner that\nthey were doing that.    Those are all breaches.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           376\n\n\n\n\n               So, before we even get to this\ntermination in February, we've had numerous breaches\non this project by SBS.      Let's talk about the\ntermination.   You heard Steve Schiffman say today that\nthe delay problem was ongoing.     It was something that\nwas being talked about and the owner wasn't happy and\nthey were on them, writing them to get this thing\ndone.   So, the idea that there wasn't an awareness on\nSBS's part that the owner was not happy with the way\nthe project was going in terms of the schedule is --\nreally ridiculous.\n               If you look at Tom Pittman's statements\n-- and I know you've seen them before, but I want to\nread them one more time.      At the meeting, there's no\nway to reconcile his statement with this being a\ntermination for convenience.     What he says is,\nabsolutely contractually, we don't have to pay you\nuntil this project is finished.        Mr. Clark just walked\nyou through the termination for convenience.        It says\npay now.   Pay when you terminate.\n               THE COURT:    Uh-huh.\n               MR. SLATES:    For Mr. Pittman to say\ncontractually we don't have to pay you until the\nproject is finished, that is by definition a\ntermination for cause.      What does he go on to say?   He\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

We don't feel like\nthat's a good business decision for either of us.         I\ndon't want to start posturing one way or the other.\nFinish it in a businesslike manner.     He's trying to be\na standup guy and get these guys paid, even though\nhe's got justification to terminate for cause.       And\nlet's talk about that justification.        Failure to apply\nenough properly skilled workers or materials.       They've\nhad recurring problems with that.     Steve Schiffman\nacknowledged it.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:   They try to make two\narguments to defeat the termination.        One is, you\ndidn't provide the right notice.     John Grable didn't\nsend a notice.    Tom Pittman didn't send a notice.\nThat's true.   But you've seen the provision.      It is\nnot a notice and opportunity to cure provision.       It is\na notice provision.   We're going to terminate you.\nOnce that notice goes out, there's nothing the\ncontractor can do to get the thing back out of the\nditch.\n               THE COURT:    But you can't send the notice\nuntil you get the certification from the initial\ndecision maker.    And that doesn't exist, does it?\n               MR. SLATES:   There is no written\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            378\n\n\n\n\ncertification.   You are right.      But what John Grable\nsays --\n               THE COURT:    Is that a condition?\n               MR. SLATES:   No, it's not a condition if\nyou've satisfied the requirement -- I think the reason\nthe initial decision maker is there is for a check, if\nyou will.    You want somebody else to weigh in to say,\nis it appropriate to terminate.       And they did that.\nThey talked to John Grable before they terminated.\nJohn Grable said from the stand that termination was\njustified.   And Tom Pittman said that he talked to\nGrable and that Grable did not say that it was\ninappropriate to terminate.     That in fact, he agreed\nthat it was appropriate to terminate.       With respect\nto --\n               THE COURT:    So, why does the AIA\ncontracts have this in there?        Upon certification, to\nget supposedly independent third party as initial\ndecision maker to certify that one of the four causes\nfor termination exists?\n               MR. SLATES:   As I said, I think it's --\nit's created, in my opinion, to present a check on an\nowner before they pull the trigger on a termination.\n               THE COURT:    Yeah.\n               MR. SLATES:   And my point is, they did go\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Grable was on\nboard with the termination.     Now, did he send out the\nnotice -- and that's an important point.        Mr. Clark\ninflated the certification and the notice issue.          Mr.\nGrable never said, I didn't certify that termination\nfor cause was justified.     What he said was, I didn't\nsend the notice of intent to terminate because I was\nhoping we could work it out.     Those are two different\nthings.\n               THE COURT:    Well, Grable wouldn't send a\nnotice of intent to terminate, would he?        Grable.\n               MR. SLATES:   The point is that he was\nasked to --\n               THE COURT:    Well, yes or no?\n               MR. SLATES:   -- send this notice by\nPittman.   There was an e-mail.    I don't remember the\nexhibit number.    Pittman says, hey, I want you to send\nthem a notice that we intend to terminate.       And he\nsaid, I never sent that because I was hoping we could\nwork it out.    He never said, I didn't agree that\ntermination was justified.     In fact, he specifically\nsaid that he agreed that termination was justified.\nSo, the check has been met.     The third party has said\nthe owner was right.    The owner was justified.     This\nwas appropriate.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Certification issue in that contract?      This\nhas had to come up before.\n                MR. SLATES:   I do not, but can certainly\nlook into it.\n                THE COURT:    Well, yeah.   Give that to me\nif you can find something.\n                MR. SLATES:   Okay.\n                THE COURT:    Anybody.\n                MR. CLARK:    It's going to be an\narbitration clause and there's going to be very few on\nit, but we'll give it a shot.\n                THE COURT:    Okay.\n                MR. SLATES:   The key thing that's going\non at the time of the termination -- or the key piece\nof information that's not known at the time of\ntermination is all these defects and the magnitude of\nthe defects and the cost of repairing those defects.\nSo, you've got Tom Pittman, who is saying, look, I'm\nterminating you for cause, in so many words.        He's\nsaying, I don't have to pay you until the project is\ndone.   But I want to take care of you.      I want to get\nyou taken care of.    At that point, he doesn't know\nabout the scope of the defects.       So, he asks for an\ninvestigation to be performed.        And that investigation\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                         381\n\n\n\n\nidentifies a number of problems.\n             You heard from Mr. Boddie.     He described\nwhat the defects are.   And we know how much it cost to\nfix those defects.    You can call it -- you can call it\ndefective work.   You can call it cost to complete.    If\nyou call it defective work, our number is 317,995.74.\nIf you call it cost to complete, our number is\n650,000.\n             There's a complaint here that, you know,\nyou never sent us the list of defects.     Well, we\ndidn't have the list of defects complete in the cost\nassociated with it done -- we didn't even have the\nproject done before this lawsuit got filed.    So, yes,\nthe list of defects didn't go to them before the\nlawsuit got filed, but it did go to them in the\ncontext of this lawsuit.   So, the idea that we were\nsomehow hiding that from them is completely untrue.\n             With respect to the defects, they billed\n98.5 percent for the metal building at the time\nthey're terminated.   And yet, you saw how much work\nhad to go into getting that building finished and the\ncost associated with doing it.    So, you've got -- if\nyou do the math in the context of these numbers, the\namount that they claim that they're owed is roughly\n305, which would equate to roughly a $13,000.00 award\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                  PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            382\n\n\n\n\nto Tri-Bar.   If you do it this way, the balance on\ntheir contract, you'll -- the remaining balance --\nthis is a balance owed.\n               THE COURT:    I got it.\n               MR. SLATES:   The remaining balance of\nwork to be performed was 400,000.        You saw that on\nExhibit 9.    So, that would produce a $250,000.00\nnumber.   And Mr. Cluck pointed you to the language\nthat says that the architect has to certify the\npayment after the termination.       That goes both ways.\nWhat that provision says is, if money is owed to them,\nthe architect has to certify that money is owed to\nthem.   Neither one of us have introduced evidence that\nthe architect says, you're owed this much money or the\narchitect says you're owed that much money.       So,\nthat's a wash.    With respect to Robertson -- unless\nyou have any other questions on the SBS aspect of\nthis.\n               THE COURT:    No.   I got it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Okay.    With respect to\nRobertson, there is no evidence of a contract.       I\nthink you've already touched upon that with Mr. Brown,\nand so I won't spend any time on it.        Other than just\nto say, you asked me a question the other day about\noral contracts.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

SLATES:    The evidence in this case is\nuncontroverted that Mr. Robertson and Mr. Pittman\nnever spoke to one another.     In fact, that's one of\nthe things that he complains about.      So, there can't\nbe an oral contract.     With respect to tortious\ninterference --\n               THE COURT:    Any e-mails between them\nabout a contract?\n               MR. SLATES:    None whatsoever.\n               THE COURT:    No communication?\n               MR. SLATES:    No communications at all.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:    There's not a written\ncommunication.    There's not an oral communication.      In\nfact, that's one of the things, as I said, that they\ncomplained about.    Turning to the tortious\ninterference issue -- again, we believe the law is\nthat there are three grounds on which to avoid\ntortious interference.      One is, we had the legal right\nto require SBS to make a change, and we believe we've\nestablished that based upon the incorporation of the\nA201 general conditions into their subcontract, and\nthe fact that the A201 allows for a termination for\nconvenience.   You may agree or disagree with me on\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

SLATES:    I don't know how you can\npossibly disagree on the next two points.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. SLATES:    The second one is that the\nperson who undertook the conduct had a good faith\nbelief that they had their right to do that.       And Tom\nPittman told you that.     He told you that he believed\nthat he had the right.     He told you that it was his\ngood faith belief that he had the right.      That he had\nno malice towards Robertson.    He's sitting there --\n              THE COURT:    He told him he's going to\ndestroy anybody in his way.\n              MR. SLATES:    No -- no, sir.   He never --\n              THE COURT:    Crush.    Excuse me.\n              MR. SLATES:    He said that about Steve\nSchiffman.   He never said anything like that about Mr.\nRobertson.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. SLATES:    And with respect to the good\nfaith belief, he's sitting there with a bid for 60,000\nand then 56,000 and then one for 21,000.      That's\nbefore he's gotten the 32.\n              THE COURT:    Uh-huh.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

SLATES:     Mr. Robertson's own words:\nWhichever one gives us the best deal is the one we go\nwith.   He believed he had the right to go with the\nlower bid.   He believed he had the right to tell SBS\nto make a change so that he could go with the lower\nbid.    He had a good faith belief that he had the right\nto --\n               THE COURT:    That's what any good\nbusinessman should do; right?\n               MR. SLATES:     You go out of business real\nfast if you go with the high bidder every time.\n               THE COURT:    Unless you sign a contract.\n               MR. SLATES:     No.   I think if you're in\nthe construction business and you go with the high\nbidder every time, things are going to go bad for you\nreal fast.   But let me just get to the last point.\nAnd I want to quote Mr. Brown on this.\n               THE COURT:    Uh-oh.\n               MR. SLATES:     He says, if you say you can\nfly, you've got to prove you can.        Our last point is\nthat we have a superior interest.\n               THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n               MR. SLATES:     And the owner has a superior\ninterest.    I can say that.    The owner owns the\nproperty.    The owner occupies the property.     The owner\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But you don't have to take my\nword for it.   You can take Mr. Robertson's word for\nit.   Because I asked him those same questions from the\nstand and he said yes to every one.      So, I'm flying\nright now because I have proven that the owner has a\nsuperior interest through Mr. Robertson's testimony.\n               THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n               MR. SLATES:    That's all I have, Your\nHonor.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.   Thank you.   Anything\nelse from anybody?\n               MR. BROWN:    Just briefly.   With regard to\nthe attorney's fees issue, I do agree that the\nmajority of my fees are -- and will be in my affidavit\n-- where incurred against Tri-Bar.       And with regard to\nthe damage issue, I would simply say -- I think it's\n9.031 of -- of the SBS/Robertson contract.\n               THE COURT:    What exhibit is that, please?\n               MR. BROWN:    That would be Exhibit 1.     And\nwe believe it will address it.       It does start off that\nin the event of any damages, but there is a provision\nin there dealing with the fact that -- that if --\nwhere in the event the subcontractor is liable, then\nthe contractor entitles himself to projected overhead,\ncorporate office, overhead profit, et cetera,\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And that section would have to be\nreflective.    I mean, it would just have to be.     It's\nin the contract, so if it applies one way, it applies\nthe other.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.

You would expect that if you submitted a\n17   change order for work that had been discussed, the\n18   architect signed it, that the owner would be signing\n19   it as well and returning it.\n20       Q.   What would be a reason that the owner\n21   wouldn't sign it?\n22       A.   We were told that there was no problem with\n23   it and it would be signed.

And so, for example, a standard practice\n7    might be, with respect to those weekly or daily job\n8    logs on issues -- you saw those when we were talking\n9    on Monday.

We have clients that pay in five and ten\n2    days, and we have clients that pay in 30 and 35 days.\n3    It kind of depends on their internal procedure.

Yes, sir.\n16       Q.     And was this Exhibit Number 4 sent at your\n17   direction?\n18       A.     Yes.\n19       Q.

So, we had\n4    started having some meetings over at Glacier Cap's\n5    office with representatives of SBS, Mr. Pittman, there\n6    was normally a representative from Mr. Grable's\n7    office, either John Grable or Matt Martinez, who would\n8    be present.\n9        Q.   And if you would, look at the second page\n10   where it says, \"Thanks for your efforts.\"    See that\n11   part at the top of the page?    \"Thanks for your efforts\n12   to get the checks and change orders in time for the\n13   meeting.\"   But he didn't have the checks by\n14   January 9th, did he?\n15       A.

All the information -- well, like I said\n6    earlier to my -- as I recall, we had some subs that\n7    called us and told us they had been paid.

Can\n8    you explain to me?    I didn't really understand that.\n9        A.   We work in an area where metal buildings are\n10   a large part of the projects that we do.   Are you\n11   familiar with how metal buildings and erections and\n12   things of that nature are done?\n13       Q.   I am generally, but I don't know if the Court\n14   is; so if you want to explain that, go ahead.\n15       A.   Here is how we do it.    It may be different\n16   how you would do it.    There are metal building\n17   companies in the marketplace that package deals\n18   together in varying ways.   They -- you pay them a\n19   price, they have -- they get the materials, they might\n20   do some engineering, they do the installation, they\n21   package together, they have a company, they have an\n22   operation, they mark it up, they charge people.    Since\n23   it's a component of our work, we set up our own\n24   operation wherein we buy the materials, we arrange for\n25   the erector, we package that together at a cheaper\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

The\n10   alternative is to go to a third party who charges\n11   more.\n12       Q.     The 8 percent fee that you charged on this\n13   project included the cost of SMS, didn't it?\n14       A.     The subcontractor -- it's a subcontractor --\n15   like the 8 percent fee on HVAC and the 8 percent fee\n16   on anybody else.\n17       Q.     But to the extent the Court was left with the\n18   perception that you didn't charge profit on SMS,\n19   that's not accurate relative to the amounts that you\n20   charged to Tri-Bar, is it?

Which one?\n6        Q.   It's 7.8, related party transactions.    7.8.1\n7    defines a related party.    Certainly SMS and SBS are\n8    related parties under that definition; would you\n9    agree?\n10       A.   Yes.\n11       Q.   And 7.8.2 says if you're going to do business\n12   with a related party, you need to let the owner know\n13   and get their approval; right?\n14       A.   Yes.\n15       Q.   And yesterday, I believe Mr. Green said that\n16   he told Mr. Grable that SMS and SBS were related.

And I think Mr. Grable said yesterday, and\n19   I did not hear anything, that one of the reasons they\n20   got us together was our metal building experience.\n21       Q.   Again --\n22       A.

Let me give you some context.\n14   Let's look at SBS Exhibit Number 12.         Do you remember\n15   this one?   It was the submittal closeout\n16   documentation.\n17       A.    Okay.    The letter to Mr. Pittman?\n18       Q.    Okay.

Work completed to this period?\n15       Q.     Yes, sir.\n16       A.     Okay.\n17       Q.     That's -- so, in other words, pay app number\n18   8 is your last bill on the project to close out the\n19   project.

But do you recall just a minute ago we\n7    looked at the termination for convenience provision.\n8    Now let's look at it again, 14.4.     And just to be --\n9    before we go back there, am I a hundred percent\n10   correct in saying you did not bill for profit on the\n11   remaining work?\n12       A.   No.    We just billed for the cost incurred to\n13   that date.\n14       Q.   All right.    Back to Robertson 17, section 14.\n15       A.   That's -- that's my understanding from\n16   looking at this here.\n17       Q.   \"In the case of termination for convenience,\n18   payment for the work executed\" -- that was 8 -- \"any\n19   costs incurred by reason of termination along with\n20   reasonable overhead and profit on the work not\n21   executed.\"   So, if you were going under this\n22   provision, you should have billed for the profit under\n23   remaining work; right, Mr. Morgan?     You weren't\n24   treating it as a convenience, were you?     You were\n25   treating it as a termination for cause.\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

No.   I think our accounting department was\n2    following a cost-plus approach to accounting.\n3        Q.     Well, Mr. Morgan, if you were following the\n4    contract and getting paid what the contract said you\n5    could be paid in a termination for convenience, you\n6    would have billed for your profit under remaining\n7    work, wouldn't you?\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> can tell you that I didn't even refer to\n9    that.    We did our accounting the way we always would,\n10   and that's all I can say.\n11       Q.     In fact, you knew it was a termination for\n12   cause.

I'm not certain that they're making a\n3    claim.    And so, that's my objection to it and was my\n4    objection then and it still is now.         It's a non-party.\n5    I'm not certain that there's a claim being made for it\n6    or collection for it.

Now, in the meeting -- I want you to\n8    go back to the meeting minutes on Exhibit 40-A.    Let\n9    me ask you, when you walked into this meeting -- I\n10   think you testified a minute ago you had no idea that\n11   you were about ready to get fired; is that right?\n12       A.   Right.\n13       Q.   Tell us how that meeting went, from your\n14   perspective.\n15       A.   Well, we all sat down in the room and they\n16   sent a person in to -- with a laptop computer to do\n17   something.   I didn't know what they were going to do\n18   at the time, but it was rather unusual.     And then Tom\n19   Pittman was not there.    He came in last -- well, he\n20   came in last and then a gentleman named Tony -- I\n21   don't remember his last name -- came in in the middle\n22   of the meeting later.    So, Tom was not actually last.\n23   But Tom came in, sat down, and basically said right\n24   off the bat, \"Rod wants to make a change.\"\n25       Q.   Okay.    Did you take that as -- I mean, let me\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Sounds like -- would that be something like\n10   termination for convenience?\n11          A.     Yes, sir.\n12          Q.     Okay.

And the\n16   number of years I've been in construction, it kind of\n17   set me back and -- and basically -- I guess we stated\n18   some cordialities after that and we exchanged -- just\n19   kind of looking for words.\n20          Q.     Now, did Mr. Pittman tell you, look, Rod\n21   wants to make this break as amicable as possible?\n22          A.     Yes.    And I took him as being sincere.\n23          Q.     Okay.

Well, I don't think that -- that -- the job\n2    itself wasn't a job where you're given a set of plans\n3    and you just went out and built a project from a set\n4    of plans.   It was constantly being redesigned.   And --\n5    which always causes some difficulties.\n6        Q.   And you say you understood part of it.    What\n7    is it that you meant when you say you understood part\n8    -- if you said that?\n9        A.   Well, because the job was constantly under\n10   redesign and there were always things that needed to\n11   be addressed, it wasn't really cohesive.    So, I guess\n12   I -- that's what I meant.\n13       Q.   There wasn't a constant flow?\n14       A.   Right.\n15       Q.   Project flow?\n16       A.   Right.\n17       Q.   Okay.    So, the project was a stop, start,\n18   stop, start type project?\n19       A.   Well, it was a surprise every day.\n20       Q.   Now, once you were told that you'd been\n21   terminated because Rod wanted to make a change for his\n22   convenience, did you ask what can we do to get back --\n23   you know, get back on the job?\n24       A.   Yeah.    I asked if there was some type of -- I\n25   forgot the word I used, but it's in here somewhere.     I\n\n\n\n                         TAMI L.

Was there ever a question about a wind\n21   bent?\n22       A.     There was not a question about a wind bent.\n23   There was a question about the hole that the wind bent\n24   was installed in.\n25       Q.     Okay.   Tell us about that.

Yeah.   I mean, typically, the wind bent is\n4    placed in the field.     Every different building\n5    manufacturer has different specifications on how the\n6    wind bents are assembled.     And Schulte specified for\n7    the wind bents to be placed in the field.     And so,\n8    therefore, when the wind bents were installed, the\n9    slots that they fit in were cut there.\n10       Q.   Would you consider that to be a modification?\n11       A.   No, sir.\n12       Q.   Okay.   And if you made the hole in the field,\n13   would that make the building a used building?\n14       A.   Absolutely not.\n15       Q.   So, if somebody was wanting a new building,\n16   would you have -- would that be a new building if you\n17   had that hole in there that's been punched in the\n18   field?\n19       A.   Yes.    It's still a new building.\n20       Q.   Now, let me ask you, there's been some\n21   discussion today and/or yesterday and I think maybe\n22   Monday about a dip in the roof.      Have you ever heard\n23   that phrase, a dip in the roof?\n24       A.   There's no dips in the roof.\n25       Q.   Okay.

Yes, sir.\n5        Q.   Okay.   Tell us how SBS built the roof on the\n6    Tri-Bar project.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> guess generically, in the construction\n8    industry, a dip in the roof would be a hollow spot\n9    somewhere on the roof.

Now, yesterday Mr. Key talked about\n12   how -- the way that SBS builds roofs that -- on a\n13   project like this, that you go up 5 feet to the first\n14   purlin and insert a raised clip?\n15       A.   Yes, sir.\n16       Q.   Is that the way you do it?\n17       A.   Yes, sir.\n18       Q.   And so, the roof sort of makes a slight\n19   upward dip?\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Correct.\n21       Q.   And then drops off; is that correct?\n22       A.   Yes, sir.\n23       Q.   Why would you ever do that?\n24       A.   Well, you have to have some space between the\n25   roof and the purlins to install the insulation.       So,\n\n\n\n                          TAMI L.

The clip on the edge of the roof ties the\n4    roof down to the last member that's there, so wind\n5    does not get underneath it and try and lift it up.\n6    And the second thing is so water drips off the roof\n7    and doesn't try to clog on the underside of the roof\n8    back into the building.\n9        Q.   Okay.   Now, I will assert to you that there\n10   have been a number of pictures that have been provided\n11   by Tri-Bar's counsel of the project.         And I can go\n12   through each one of them with you, but -- and they\n13   show things that need to be done; maybe a bad cut,\n14   maybe insulation, you know, various things.        Okay.    In\n15   the middle of a project, would that be unusual to find\n16   things like that?\n17       A.   No, sir.    They're items that we would go\n18   through and punch --\n19       Q.   Okay.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">-- and have repaired or have finished.\n21       Q.

It says, \"We'll be filing a lien on\n23   the property on Friday, February 15\"?\n24       A.

Yes, sir.\n3        Q.     That's what it says.     Okay.     And then you\n4    wrote back to Jerrod Robertson.       It says that you've\n5    placed a number of calls to Pittman, but have not\n6    gotten a return call.\n7        A.     That's correct.\n8        Q.     Is that starting to be the wall of silence\n9    that you're encountering when dealing on this project?\n10       A.     Yes.\n11       Q.     Okay.    Both in terms of getting paid or being\n12   told about problems or reasons why -- or problems with\n13   the job or reasons why you're not getting paid; is\n14   that right?\n15       A.     Right.\n16       Q.     Okay.    Now, I want you to take a look at\n17   Exhibit 17, correspondence to Mr. Pittman dated March\n18   19th.    Can you tell us about this letter?\n19       A.     Basically, it's just telling Mr. Pittman that\n20   we'd like to get paid again, and that he made some\n21   representations in the February 15th meeting -- and\n22   I'm not reading it word for word, but we'd like him to\n23   live up to those representations.\n24       Q.     Okay.    And if you'll look at -- it says on\n25   February 28th, and we're going to talk about that\n\n\n\n                           TAMI L.

Is that a -- I mean, that's what was\n19   happening is that, at least as far as March the 19th,\n20   as far as Mr. Pittman was concerned, the wall of\n21   silence was continuing?\n22       A.

(Witness complying.)\n6        Q.    What is that paragraph about?\n7        A.    Well, it's referencing a letter that was\n8    issued by John Grable, basically saying that we have a\n9    real problem with the -- or they had a real problem\n10   with some things they were seeing on the job and that\n11   we should be calling our insurance company.\n12       Q.

The foundation was reformed and\n18   inspected prior to pouring.\"     Okay.   And then it says,\n19   \"By several e-mails among and between SBS, Grable, and\n20   Victor de Anda on August 18th, 2012, supported by the\n21   field observation report, both de Anda and Grable\n22   approved and poured the foundation that's currently in\n23   place.\"   Is that your understanding?\n24       A.

In your\n2    experience, is it typical for a structural engineer to\n3    go out and inspect and verify the area for a concrete\n4    pour?\n5        A.   Yes, definitely.\n6        Q.   Do you have any reason to believe that Mr. de\n7    Anda did not do that in this case?\n8        A.   No.    I have no reason to believe he did not\n9    do it.\n10       Q.

No, sir.    What we offered was to pay for\n9    concrete in advance because the nonpayment from Lewis\n10   to the concrete contractor -- to the concrete supplier\n11   would not allow us -- he would not allow us to buy any\n12   concrete on any type of credit.

The project plans and specifications\n7    are continually being adjusted.      Could you tell me\n8    what you meant when you put that in that letter?\n9        A.   Yes.    When you have consistent changes and\n10   you add on top of it the fact that you're not being --\n11   being consistently paid and you have the additional\n12   burden of change orders that aren't approved.       So,\n13   therefore, you're truly liable for that amount of\n14   money without any authorization, which really\n15   compounds the amount of risk that you have in regards\n16   to receivables.\n17       Q.

Were you aware that the building was field\nmodified to address the fact that the foundation was\ntoo small for the building?\n       A.   Yes.\n       Q.   Did you advise the owner of that?\n       A.   Yes.\n       Q.   When?\n       A.   Pardon?\n       Q.   When?\n       A.   I happened to be in the field that day when\n-- when we discussed it.       And Tom Pittman came to the\njob and we walked over to the back of his -- a pickup\ntruck; I can't say it was his pickup truck.      And he\nwas sitting there and we talked to him about it.      He\nalso had another gentleman with him while he was\nthere.\n       Q.   Was that Bob Cardin?\n       A.   I don't know his name.\n       Q.

That was after the field modification had\nalready occurred, wasn't it?\n    A.     The field modification had occurred prior to\nus -- prior to the first meeting.\n    Q.     My question to you, Mr. Schiffman, is, can\nyou point me to any evidence that would suggest that\nthe owner was provided notice that you were going to\nfield modify that building to make it fit the\nfoundation before you did it?\n    A.     The field modification you're referring to\nwas there the day Tom Pittman and the engineers and\neverybody else came out and inspected the job.\n    Q.     My point, Mr. Schiffman, is at that point\nyou've got a building that's erected, you've got\nhangar doors that are installed, and you've got wing\nwalls that aren't big enough to accommodate the door\nopening so it doesn't open to 80 feet.       I'm talking\nabout before they built those walls, they had to cut\nthose metal members somehow or modify them in some way\nto make them fit on that foundation.        And I want to\nknow what evidence you can point me to to say the\nowner was put on notice of that before it was done and\ngiven an opportunity to approve it.     It doesn't exist,\ndoes it?\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

What I'm trying to\nget at is, there may be -- if you look at one page and\nlook at another page -- an inconsistency.     But nobody\ncalled that to his attention, did they?\n    A.

I'll represent to you that the defect claim\nwe're making for plumbing is 13,300, and I'm\nrounding --\n      A.   Okay.\n      Q.   -- or 13,700, so I'm rounding it up to 14.\nAnd I'm backing that down to 19.      14 and 19 is 33.\n      A.   Right.\n      Q.

We're disappointed; we understand part of it.\nSo, when he says, gave you every chance, lots of\ndelays; your response is, we understand part of it.\nRight?\n    A.     That's what it says.      Yes.\n    Q.     And it doesn't say anywhere in there that you\nwere protesting, saying, no, there weren't any delays;\nyou didn't give us lots of chances.         You didn't say\nthat, did you?\n    A.     I was very discombobulated by the fact that\nwe were being taken off the job.        There were a lot of\nthings I probably said that I didn't understand\nmyself.\n    Q.     That sounds like a no, you didn't say that.\n    A.     That's what I just said.\n    Q.     Okay.   And then further down, Mr. Cluck\ndidn't ask you about this either.        It says, not seen\nthe best side of SBS Construction for many reasons.\nYou were acknowledging you didn't provide the kind of\nservice that you expected to provide to your client,\nweren't you?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     Well, if we didn't see the best side of SBS,\nwhat side did we see, Mr. Schiffman?\n    A.     You know, it's -- you're taking it out of\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

It's really saying that you guys didn't\nreally see the best side of SBS for many reasons.        And\nthe many reasons are all the changes, all the things\nthat took place, the lack of communication, et cetera,\net cetera.\n    Q.     Let's look at the next page.      Here you said,\nthis is a job site -- I understand.      We're upfront\nforthright people.     We had some problems and we're\ntruly sorry about it.    You're acknowledging that SBS\nhad problems on the project, aren't you?\n    A.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.     And in fact, you're not just acknowledging\nit; you're apologizing for it and acknowledging\nresponsibility for it?\n    A.     I think that -- I think that was -- what I'm\ndoing is just babbling at that point because I didn't\nknow what else to say.\n    Q.     Well, your babble was an apology and\nacknowledgement of problems; correct?\n    A.     There were some problems.   There's problems\non every project that we're on.     But they're always\novercome.    They're always worked on.      They're always\nworked out.\n    Q.

Then the other contractor will need to first\nreview the shop drawings to see if they're in\ncompliance with the architectural and structural\nplans.   If there are any discrepancies, they need to\nnote them on the plans, then they need to submit to\nthe architect who's the lead on the design team.     Then\nthe architect will send the shop drawings to us and\nthen we'll review it against our plans to see if they\ncomply with ours.

Yes.    To extend the foundation.   Yes.\n    Q.    And why was the as-built condition of the\nfoundation an issue that -- that you guys needed to\naddress and provide a fix for?\n    A.    Because we were carrying veneer that is heavy\nand cannot be carried in a small piece of a concrete\nground without reinforcement.\n    Q.

I'm going to switch gears on you a\nlittle bit.   There's been a lot of testimony in this\ncase regarding the hangar doors of the hangar.

Mr. Boddie, can you tell the Court about your\nbackground in the construction industry, including\nyour educational background?\n    A.     Sure.   I graduated from Texas A&M University,\nwith a degree in construction science.        I've been\nworking in construction for probably ten years,\nanywhere from Washington, D.C. to Kansas, San Antonio.\nWhen I was in school, I was working for an electrical\ncontractor.    I've had my own company now for about\nthree years.    Started off with Turner Construction,\nthe nation's largest general contractor.        So, I've\nbeen doing this for a while.\n    Q.     How did you get involved with the Los\nCerritos Hangar project?\n    A.     Through Tom Pittman.    Working with Turner, I\nmet Tom.   We did a project together.        And when I\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

What did you understand your role to be on\nthe Los Cerritos Hangar project?\n    A.   I was going to be the construction manager.\nSo, the way that Tom approached me about it was to\nhold all the contracts through his company -- not\nTom's company, but through Lewis.     And then I was\ngoing to manage all the trades on the site.\n    Q.   Did you also have conversations with Mr.\nPittman about the condition of the SBS work?\n    A.   We did.\n    Q.   Were you charged with doing anything to\ninvestigate the condition of the SBS work?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   What were you asked to do?\n    A.   I was asked to go around and -- and check the\nbuilding, see if there were any defects in the\nworkmanship.    Tom pointed out a couple areas to me\nthat he knew about, including the hangar door pockets.\nSome of the big ticket items, like the framing, were\ndiscussed early on.   When Tom and I first met out\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Did you solicit input from a metal building\ncompany?\n    A.     We did.   Speedway Erectors.\n    Q.     Speedway Erectors was the name of the\ncompany?\n    A.     Yes.\n    Q.     Did you accompany Speedway representatives\nfor portions of their inspections?\n    A.     I did.\n    Q.     Did you have interactions with them about the\nthings that they observed?\n    A.     I did.    We spent an entire day walking around\nlooking at defects in the metal building, installation\nquality that wasn't up to industry standards.      And you\nknow, we climbed up on the roof.       We were in man\nbaskets.   We were pretty thorough in our\ninvestigation.\n    Q.     Did you personally inspect all of the\nconditions of the project?\n    A.     I did.\n    Q.     And did a Speedway representative provide you\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

He did.\n    Q.    And based on your personal inspection of the\nconditions, can you confirm that those photographs\naccurately reflect the conditions on the project at\nthe time?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Did you personally observe all locations\nwhere those photographs were taken?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Did you also take photographs of the various\nconditions?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    Did you make observations about the\nconditions that you considered to be defective?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    And were you involved in evaluating whether\nor not the metal building was out of plumb?\n    A.    I was.\n    Q.    I want to direct your attention to SBS\nExhibit Number 84, which is in a binder up there.\n    A.    Which binder am I looking at now?\n    Q.    I tell you what; Ms. Brazell is going to pull\nit up.   That's probably the easiest way to do it.\nThis is an e-mail, as you can see, from Matthew\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And it's transmitting the building tolerances\nthat he received from Schulte.        Does that accurately\nreflect what that document is?\n    A.    Yes.\n    Q.    Do you recall receiving this?\n    A.    I do.\n    Q.    Did you review it to evaluate what the\ntolerances were for the building being out of plumb?\n    A.    I did.\n    Q.    And did you find some provisions that you\nthought would be applicable to that evaluation?\n    A.    Yes, sir.    Basically, right there in\n7.13.1.1, if you look at the second -- that section B\nright there, it talks about industry standards for\nsteel construction and how the columns are allowed to\nbe installed.\n    Q.

SLATES)    First let's figure out what\nthe tolerances are.\n    A.   Okay.   So, on a column, if you're looking\ndown a column, if this is your building line right\nhere, being the exterior of the building.   You're\nallowed within the first 20 stories, according to\nAmerican Institute of Steel Construction, that that\ncolumn can lean 1 inch in the first 20 stories towards\nthe outside of the building.    1 inch.\n    Q.   In 20 stories?\n    A.   20 stories.\n    Q.   How many stories is this building?\n    A.   Three max.\n    Q.   So, the math -- about a third of an inch?\n    A.   Yeah, give or take a little bit.    You can\nmake that argument.    And then you're allowed -- so,\nit's 1 inch this way, 2 inches towards the interior of\nthe building.\n    Q.   In 20 stories?\n    A.   In 20 stories.\n    Q.   Okay.   There's another provision I want to\ncall your attention to that Mr. Key referenced during\nhis testimony.   And I'll show it to you.   It's on the\nnext page from where we were.   Mr. Key called our\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

Yes.\n      A.   Yeah.\n      Q.   You noticed that before?\n      A.   Yeah.   I noticed that as well.   And you could\neasily say that we were way outside that tolerance.\n      Q.   So, if we calculate, based on a three-story\nbuilding, 1/16 of an inch, what would the tolerance\nbe?\n      A.   3/16.\n      Q.   So, using the language that you reference,\nthe tolerance would be what number?      Doing the\ncalculation based on the language we looked at just a\nmoment ago, it would be what?\n      A.   It would be less than an inch, a third of an\ninch.\n      Q.   And doing the calculation based on the\nsection Mr. Key pointed to, what would be the\ntolerance?\n      A.   3/16.\n      Q.   All right.   Now I want to ask you, how did\nyou go about determining whether or not the building\nwas within plumb?\n      A.   Sure.   So, the first step, obviously, is to\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Slap it on the side\nof a column, see what the level reads out, you know,\npull the level a little bit away from that column.        If\nthat level is -- you know, pull away from the column\nand a substantial amount over 4 feet, you know that\nyou're going to have a problem.\n                We identified that first.   And when we\nwent to our columns, we were able to set up a laser\nlevel at the base of the column.     And that laser level\nis self-righting, so it shines directly up and down in\na perfect plane.    So, we were able to measure\nbasically up the column, measure this distance here,\none in the middle, and one at the base and determine\nhow the column was leaning.\n    Q.   Am I understanding your testimony correctly\nthat you used a laser level to make that\ndetermination?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And in using the laser level, what did you\ndetermine as to how far out of plumb the building was?\n    A.   It was 2 inches.\n    Q.   Does that exceed both of the tolerances that\nwe just looked at?\n    A.   Yes.\n    Q.   Does it exceed them by what level of\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

You know, it's -- if you go by 3/16,\nI mean, you're talking an inch and 9/16 -- or an inch\nand 13/16 out of plumb.    That's huge.\n    Q.   Okay.    You can sit back down.\n    A.   Sure.

You know, we worked with the\nsubcontractor to determine what amount of work was --\nwas allocated to each action item on that invoice.\nAnd a lot of it was observation out in the field,\ntracking time and hours and how many guys were working\non what activity.      You know, I kept daily reports of\ndetailed items like that.       And I was -- that was how I\nwas able to make those determinations.\n       Q.

The first tab is what?\n    A.   The first tab is PEMB labor by United\nErectors.   It's installing roof insulation and new\nroof sheets.\n    Q.   And why was that necessary?\n    A.   The removal of the roof was necessary in\norder to rack the building; in order to bring it back\nthe 2 inches that it was out of plumb.      It was also\nnecessary because the roof was installed improperly\nusing the wrong clips.   There were splices in the\nsheets which weren't allowed by the specifications.\nFor those three reasons, we had to remove the roof and\ninstall a new one.\n    Q.   If you can demonstrate for us at the easel\nwhat you mean by why you had to remove the roof to\nrack the building, and also the issue with the clips\nyou just referenced, I think that would be helpful.\n    A.   Sure.   (Witness complying.)      So, on any\nbuilding that you build, your roof is -- your roof is\nyour diaphragm of the building.    Any time that you\nbuild a steel building, specifically a metal\nbuilding -- if you look at the directions that are\ngiven in front of the documents, you can put the walls\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                  PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           215\n\n\n\n\non before you put the roof on, but you -- once you put\nthat roof on, it pretty well racks that building into\nits current location.\n             So, being as how our building was -- this\nis a little dramatic, but leaning 2 inches; in order\nfor us to pull these members back, we had to remove\nthe roof sheets.    You know, you run into the problem\nof -- with roof sheets like these -- these are\nstanding seam roof sheets.    Once they're seamed, you\ncan't just take one out.    You have to go all the way\nback to whichever one you want to get out.    So, let's\nsay your directional of your seams are running this\nway and you want to pull out a panel here.    In the\ncase of -- I guess we'll get to it later.    But in the\ncase of the spliced panel, you would have to take all\nof these sheets out in order to get to that panel.\n             Now, for us, it was -- it was a matter\nof solving three issues with this roof.     Right.   So,\nwhen we got the building back to plumb, we were able\nto lock the building back into place by putting a new\nroof system on.    We were also able to correct the\nsplices in the roof sheets and we were also able to\ncorrect the clips.\n    Q.   Tell us what the clip issue is.\n    A.   Okay.    So, if you were to look through this\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                         216\n\n\n\n\nbuilding, looking this way down this eave line right\nhere, what you would see is that eave line was doing\nthat number.   Essentially, there were three different\ntypes of clips used.    You have a high clip, a medium\nclip, and a low clip that was used all the way down\nthe eave of this building, creating a wave effect.\n               The way that the metal building\nmanufacturer recommends that you install these clips\nis one of two ways.    You can use a high, medium, and\nlow here, floating clip, or you can use a uniform\nclip; you could use a high or a medium or a low across\nthe entire building.    But that's not what they did.\n    Q.   Okay.    What did they do?\n    A.   They went across the roof sheets and would\nuse a high, a medium, a low, a medium, a high.    There\nwas no specific pattern to it across that eave.\n    Q.   Was there any consistency to how they used\nthe roof clips?\n    A.   There was not.\n    Q.   What did that create in the field?\n    A.   It created a wave pattern in the roof.\nEssentially, with that wave pattern, it created\ninconsistencies in the roof which could have\npotentially caused leaks later on.\n    Q.   Okay.    If I can take you back up to the\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But if we look at\ndeficiency Exhibit Number 1 -- photograph number 1,\ntell us what we're seeing there.\n    A.   What you're seeing -- if you look -- you can\nsee daylight coming in through that roof panel right\nthere.\n    Q.   Right here?\n    A.   So, you're looking underneath the ridge cap.\nAnd a piece of metal that is supposed to be a\nwatertight system from creating -- it basically\ncreates a condition where driving rain is supposed to\nbe kept out of there.   Unfortunately, they didn't use\nthe right flashing piece right there and water was --\nwater could potentially be able to enter the building\nat that point.\n    Q.   All right.    Let's look at photograph number 2\nin Exhibit Number 20.   What are we seeing here?\n    A.   You're seeing a condition where the roof\nsheets weren't cut short enough.    Roofs -- these roofs\nare made to expand and contract.    Essentially at that\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And if we go to photograph 3 in the\ndeficiency log?\n     A.   You're seeing a lack of tape seal connecting\nwith the roof panel system right there.      You can see\nthe wave in the tape seal beneath the end dam that\nwould create an air gap or a void space where water\ncould potentially get through.\n     Q.   Is that a problem?\n     A.   Absolutely.\n     Q.   All right.\n     A.   I don't want water in my buildings.\n     Q.   I don't like it in mine either.     Photograph\n4?\n     A.   Again, on the -- on the right side, you're\nseeing an air gap there where water could get in.\n     Q.   Photograph 5?\n     A.   You're seeing a condition looking from the\neave of the roof up to the -- up to the ridge.     You're\nseeing a -- a connection between the two roof panels.\n     Q.   If you want to articulate with the\nphotograph, feel free to come down.\n     A.   Okay.\n     Q.   I'm sorry.    I interrupted you.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

You're seeing the seam on a roof -- on two roof\npanels, you're seeing the condition that the different\nclips was causing with the roof panels, essentially\ncreating a gap at the bottom.\n    Q.     Okay.    And if we go to photograph 6 on the\ndeficiency log?\n    A.     You're seeing -- this is at the copula,\nlooking up -- or looking down into the building.\nYou're seeing a cut roof sheet that wasn't flashed\nproperly.\n    Q.     Is that the exterior of the building?\n    A.     That is the exterior.\n    Q.     If rain hits that location, what's going to\nhappen?\n    A.     It's going inside.\n    Q.     And if we go to photograph 7 in Exhibit 20?\n    A.     You're looking up one of the rakes right\nthere.    This piece was fabricated in the field.    This\nshould have been a manufactured piece by the metal\nbuilding company.\n    Q.     If we go to photograph 8, is that a similar\nlocation?\n    A.     It is.   It's just looking the opposite\ndirection.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Photograph 9; is that another\ncondition of flashing issues?\n    A.    That is.    It's another flashing issue.   If\nyou look to -- you've got some pretty bad welding\nmarks that have burned up the roof system here, as\nwell as the insulation down here.\n    Q.    Okay.   Photograph 10?\n    A.    You're looking at the three different types\nof clips that were used on that job.\n    Q.    When you talked about that undulating effect,\nhow does that correlate to those clips?\n    A.    You've got your high clip, your medium clip,\nand your low clip there.      By using those different\nclips, essentially, you know, the high clip is going\nto push that roof to sit higher and the low clip is\ngoing to push that roof to sit lower.\n    Q.    All right.     Photograph 11?\n    A.    That's a splice that was created in two\npanels.\n    Q.    Photograph 12?     It's not supposed to be like\nthat, is it?\n    A.    No.\n    Q.    All right.\n    A.    Not according to the documents.\n    Q.    And I think Mr. Schiffman acknowledged that\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Photograph 12 in Exhibit 20?\n    A.     This is looking down the door pockets.    You\ncan see here -- this only happened at the door pockets\nwhere the roof actually tapered off onto the sides.\nIt wasn't a uniform level condition.\n    Q.     What does that say in the text box?\n    A.     \"Shows roof drop-off at front end wall.     Same\ncondition on both sides of the building due to\nimproper field fabrication of shortened door pockets.\n    Q.     Tell us what you mean by the reference to the\nfield fabrication of the shortened door pockets.\n    A.     Sure.   I'll draw it.   So, the roof system\ncame down, and then where it hit the door pocket, it\nkind of curved off here.     What happened is, when these\ndoor pockets were shortened up, a piece was fabricated\nto sit on top of a column.     When they brought the\ncolumns in, it appeared to me as though calculations\nwere done improperly.     This slope right here should\nhave been straight and level; but instead, this piece\nwas cut too short.    They tried to shim it up, if you\nwill.    And when they did that, it created the -- the\nslope in the roof panels.\n    Q.     Is that associated with the field fabrication\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    On the next photograph 13 in\nExhibit Number 20, is that the same condition, just a\ndifferent view?\n    A.   It is.\n    Q.   Photograph 14 of Exhibit Number 20; is that\nanother spliced roof panel?\n    A.   It is.\n    Q.   Photograph 15 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.   This is the ridge cap.\n    Q.   Where is that; at the top of the building?\n    A.   Yes, sir.    The very peak.   They're missing\nscrews in here.   If you look at the construction\ndocuments from Schulte, there's an improper amount of\nscrews that were included in that.\n    Q.   Okay.    Let's look at photograph 16.\n    A.   Same condition.    It's -- not as the previous,\nbut at the ridge cap here, you've got an air gap\nallowing water to enter the system.\n    Q.   And is 17 the same issue?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.

This was field fabricated in order to\ntry and make that slope work, but it was\nmiscalculated.\n    Q.    All right.     Let's look at 20 of Exhibit\nNumber 20 -- photograph 20.\n    A.    You're looking here at a missing piece of\nright trim and a panel -- roof panel that was cut.\nShouldn't have been cut that way.\n    Q.    21 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.    Same panel.

You're looking at the door pocket from\nfurther away, where you can see the drop-off and the\nslope of the roof right there.\n    Q.   If you look up on the right side of the\nphotograph, you can't see the lines of the roof\nsheet?\n    A.   Right.\n    Q.   But over the hangar door, can you see the\nlines?\n    A.   You can.\n    Q.   Tell us what -- why that is.\n    A.   Essentially, there's two reasons.   All right.\nOne is, you've got longer panels right here.   So, you\nshould be able to see the little bit longer line, but\nyou should not see that shift in the slope right here.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

It is.\n      Q.   27 also?\n      A.   It is.\n      Q.   All right.     Let's go to photograph 28 of\nExhibit 20.\n      A.   This is looking up at some of the wind\nbracing.   We had installed clips onto these in order\nto brace the CMU walls.\n      Q.   And 29?\n               MR. CLARK:      Mr. Slates, we don't have any\nof those in our book.\n               MR.

Right here looking at -- we used a laser\nagain to measure the plumbness of the door tracks up\non the top of the main supports.       These pieces right\nhere were fabricated -- field modified prior to us\narriving on site, and it caused the hangar door track\nto be out of plumb.     It was basically a corrective\naction because the building was out of place, and the\nbuilding was racked.      And so, what we knew is, once\nthat building was brought back in, that these were\ngoing to be out of plumb.\n    Q.    Okay.   Let's go to 30.\n    A.    You're looking underneath -- this is the\nrailing that supports the door.       These are all thread\nrods which were inserted into the concrete and a piece\nof angle that was supporting the -- the track right\nthere.   The door was currently sitting on that door\ntrack causing a bend.\n    Q.    Is that supposed to be like that?\n    A.    No, sir.    In fact, you're not supposed to put\nthose doors on until you pour the concrete.\n    Q.    31, is that the same condition?\n    A.    Yes, sir.    You can see here, you're actually\nmissing -- you're not missing -- the nut is there, but\nit's not connected to the all-thread.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

That's the door track down\nhere -- the supports for it.     And this piece right\nhere was field modified and incorrectly installed.\n    Q.     Photograph number 36 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.     You're looking at the copula.     You're looking\nat the beam that was -- or yeah, you're looking at a\nbeam that was welded to a column.      It wasn't welded\nall the way around.    Typically in this position,\nyou'll see something that's welded on all four sides.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

You're looking at -- you're looking up at the\ncopula.    You're looking at insulation that wasn't\ntucked.    You can also see, there were backup plates\nhere that were supposed to be installed on all of\nthese roof sheets that weren't installed.\n      Q.   Now, in photograph 42 of Exhibit 20, what are\nwe seeing?\n      A.   This is looking at door pockets.   You're\nstanding in front of the hangar looking out.    These\npieces that are running here, John, these horizontal\npieces were the ones that were field modified.    They\nwere cut down in order to accommodate the foundation\nsize.\n      Q.   Did that create a problem in the roof line\nthat we saw earlier?\n      A.   It did.\n      Q.   If we go to 43 of Exhibit 20?\n      A.   You're looking back up at the copula again.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

All right.     44?\n    A.   You're looking at the door here that was\nmissing some X-bracing, missing a couple bolts.       You\ncan see this -- this cutout right here in this beam\nwas -- didn't have bracing supporting it.\n    Q.   All right.     45?\n    A.   Same thing.    Missing bolts.      You've got one\nclip here with one bolt in it.\n    Q.   Okay.    46?\n    A.   Same thing.    Missing bolts.\n    Q.   47?\n    A.   This is the wind bracing; again, missing\nclips that attached to the CMU wall.\n    Q.   If we look at 48, what do we see?\n    A.   You're seeing bracing that we had to install\non that wall.    That being the windward side, there was\na concern on our part that the wind could affect that\nCMU wall since it wasn't braced off to the wind braces\non the building.\n    Q.   What's in the text box on that one?\n    A.   \"Superstructure was erected out of plumb.\nEnd wall columns lean 2 inches towards the west.       No\ngap at bottom of column versus top of column.\"       So, if\nyou look here, you got more light coming through down\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

And the next one is -- is\nphotograph 49.   What do we see there?\n      A.   You're looking at what I refer to as basic\nred oxide framing.      This framing was installed not per\nthe specifications that were on the architectural\ndrawings.\n      Q.   Can we actually -- I think I have a --\nactually, let's pull up Tri-Bar 27.     What do the\nstructural plans call for in terms of the framing?\n      A.   So, this number right here; it's a little\ntough to read, I understand.     But essentially, this\nnumber right here is an identification code for a type\nof metal stud to be used.     If you were to give that\nto any metal stud supplier, they would be able to\ngive you an exact piece.     It calls out the thickness,\nthe size, the height -- or the length, rather, the\ngauge of the metal, what it's supposed to be finished\nas.   It's basically a very specific identification\ncode.\n      Q.   And this is hard to read, but what is it\nsupposed to be in terms of how far they're supposed to\nbe off center?\n      A.   16-inches.\n      Q.   What does it say here?\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Did SBS use galvanized materials?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     What did they use?\n    A.     They used basically red oxide primer.\n    Q.     Did SBS do 16-inch off center?\n    A.     No, sir.    They were 2 foot.\n    Q.     Okay.   All right.    Let's go back to Tri-Bar\n20 and go to photograph 50.       And what do we have in\nour text box here?\n    A.     This is purlins that they were using for the\nroof system.     Essentially, what they were doing is\nthey were creating a space by bending up the top of\nthe purlin -- that purlin, when it's recalled out of\nthe factory, looks like that.       What they were doing is\nbending this up, compromising the integrity of that\nframing.   So, had you put a load on top of it -- say,\nconcrete -- it would have -- it would have come\ncrashing down eventually.\n    Q.     And was that called for there?\n    A.     No.   It was not called to do that.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     This isn't even the right member to be\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Go to photograph 51 of 20.\n    A.    This is where you -- we took the spacers out\nso that you can more clearly see the bends in the\nZ-purlins.\n    Q.    Okay.   Photograph 52 of Exhibit 20?\n    A.    Same thing, looking down the line.\n    Q.    What does the note say?\n    A.    \"Spacing of the purlins did not match the\narchitectural drawings located at 16 inches on center.\nNote, the box beam headers did not exist to frame the\nopenings.\"\n    Q.    All right.\n    A.    So, typically, when you're using light gauge\nmetal framing, you create box beam headers to go over\nwindows, doors, et cetera.\n    Q.    How about photograph 53 of Exhibit Number 20?\n    A.    You're missing a double purlin in the inside\ncorner.\n    Q.    54?\n    A.    This is again showing where we took out the\nbracing on the purlins.\n    Q.    How about 55?\n    A.    This is still showing the incorrect type of\nsteel framing.

You're looking at the start of a CMU wall\nhere.      You're also looking at the corner of the\nfoundation.     Oh, I'm sorry.    No, you're not.   You're\nlook at the end door pocket.        So, this is where we\nfixed in that door pocket 2 and a half feet.\n      Q.     Is that when you first learned that the\nfoundation brick lug did not have a grade beam\nbeneath?\n      A.     This was part of it.    The other part of the\ninvestigation was when we had to go and do our\nadditional concrete for the brick lug around the\npilasters.     The drawings called for 12-inch stone to\nsit there and there was no concrete there for a\n12-inch stone to sit on.\n      Q.     Let's look at 65.   What's that location?\n      A.     You're looking at the same location.    This is\nthe door pockets.\n      Q.     Okay.   And 66?\n      A.     This is the brick lug that I was referring to\nearlier.     The distance from the CMU to the edge of the\nconcrete needs to be 13 inches.        There also needed to\nbe concrete to fill in this area right here.

Was it that condition all the way\naround the building?\n    A.   All the way around.\n    Q.   67?\n    A.

You're looking at the slab depression taking\nthe measurement of how far it was off the framing.\n    Q.     Look at photograph 75 of Exhibit 20 and tell\nus what we see there.\n    A.     You're looking at the apron that wasn't\npoured.\n    Q.     And what about Exhibit Number 76?\n    A.     This is us going back and drilling and\nepoxying dowels in place.      The drawings called for the\ndowels to be 1-foot centers.      They were installed at\n2-foot centers.\n    Q.     Did you have to add material?\n    A.     We did.\n    Q.

And 80 is the actual pour of the concrete?\n    A.   Correct.\n    Q.   What do we see in photograph 81?\n    A.   You're looking at the trench drains.      The\nsystem that was purchased and called for was left\non-site for us to install.     Essentially, we ran into\nan issue to where there were leave-outs left in place\nfor these trench drains to go.      But if you can see\nhere, you've got the slab elevation and then the top\nof the trench drain.     So, naturally, we had to go and\ncut out some concrete in order to install those trench\ndrains to be flush.\n    Q.   What's wrong with that if it's not flush?\n    A.   It won't drain.     You're never going to get\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

I think\nit's easier to see in the next photograph.\n      A.   It is.   You're looking in the opposite\ndirection from inside looking out.       And you can see\nthat if water were to pond here, if you will, there's\nno way for it to escape into that trench drain.\n      Q.   Okay.    Photograph 83 of Exhibit Number 20?\n      A.   You're looking below the doors.\n      Q.   84?\n      A.   You're looking at wiring in the walls.     The\nwiring was the wrong size for the load that the\nbuilding needed to receive.\n      Q.   What about photograph 85 of Exhibit Number\n20?\n      A.   The same thing looking at -- you're looking\nat wiring coming out of the slab that had to be\ndemolished.\n      Q.   Let's look at 86 -- photograph 86 of Exhibit\nNumber 20.\n      A.   Okay.    Essentially, you're looking at conduit\nthat was roughed-in with wire pulled to it.\nTypically, you don't pull wire unless you're\nterminating into something, whether it be a junction\nbox, a panel, a trough, for that matter.      You don't\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

We saw photographs earlier where there were\ngaps in those pictures.    Do you remember that?\n    A.   I do.\n    Q.   Is that this same condition?\n    A.   This is at the same location.\n    Q.   That's what I mean.    Is this what you did to\nfix the gaps?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Let's go to 3.\n    A.   You're looking at the same -- same picture of\nlooking up the roof system, but you can see the gap\nhere is greatly reduced.    You can also see the seam in\nthe two roof sheets.\n    Q.   And is Exhibit 21, photograph 4 a similar\nphotograph?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   It doesn't have a gap, does it?\n    A.   That's right.\n    Q.   Photograph 5 of Exhibit 21?\n    A.

You can\nnote the substantial difference in clips on the wind\nbracing.   You can also note the -- the angles here\nthat were installed to brace the wall above the CMU.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.

Same thing; you're looking at the wind\nbracing and all the clips.\n       Q.   How about photograph 16 of Exhibit 21?\n       A.   You're looking at wind bracing that's\nconnecting purlins to the beams, essentially creating\na way for those not to roll in conjunction with the\nbending.\n       Q.   Was the wind bracing there when you got\nthere?\n       A.   No, sir.\n       Q.   Did you have to add it or have someone else\nadd it?\n       A.   We had to add it.\n       Q.   Photograph 17 of Exhibit 21?\n       A.   You're looking up at the copula.     Here you\ncan see one of the fans that was purchased -- the fan\nthat was left on-site for us was too big to fit in the\nopening of the copula.        The drawings called for one\nfan.    Unfortunately, because that fan didn't fit, we\nhad to get higher velocity fans and use two of them in\norder to move the same amount of air.\n       Q.   Was -- and it's the brand name, to explain\nthe use of the vulgarity.        But the name of the fan\nthat we see in that picture was a Big Ass Fan;\n\n\n\n                        TAMI L.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.     But was the one that was supposed to go in\nthe copula a Big Ass Fan?\n    A.     No, sir.    It was just an exhaust fan.    If you\nlook at the size of it, in order to frame that thing\nout, you know, it's a pretty small fan in relation to\nto the Big Ass Fan below.       However, it's meant to\nexhaust jet fumes, plane fumes out of the building.\nThose are a little more comfort oriented.\n    Q.     If the argument has been made in this case\nthat SBS couldn't possibly be responsible for that fan\nbecause they didn't order the Big Ass Fan, is there a\nmistaken assumption in that argument?\n    A.     Well, let's not -- let's not confuse the Big\nAss Fan with the exhaust fans.        There was an exhaust\nfan that was left on-site that was the wrong size.\n    Q.     Okay.\n    A.     That is the fan that had to be replaced which\nmatches the cost allocation that we input into our\nspreadsheet.\n    Q.     Okay.   Let's look at photograph 18 of Exhibit\nNumber 21.\n    A.

This is the interior.     There's a\ncouple things you can see here.    You can see the\nbracing on the beams to the -- to the purlins.     You\ncan see all the paneling that's done inside.     You can\nsee all the conduit that we had to re-run.     You can\nsee the light fixtures installed.    You can see Big Ass\nFan installed again.    You can see the other exhaust\nfans on the opposite side of the copula installed\nunder there.\n    Q.   Okay.   If we look at photograph 20 of Exhibit\nNumber 21?\n    A.   You're looking at a -- basically a level up\nagainst the column --\n    Q.   Okay.\n    A.   -- after the building was racked on location.\n    Q.   And if we go to photograph 21?\n    A.   You're looking at us pouring the grade beam\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

What did you have to do to do that?\n    A.   We had to excavate out.      We had to install\npins into the grade beam.     You know, it was a pretty\ndrawn-out process by going back to Victor de Anda and\nhaving him come up with the design; us renting\nequipment; us buying material, labor.        I mean, it was\njust a pretty long drawn-out process.\n    Q.   Was that done to address the fact that the\nbrick lug didn't have the grade beam support below it?\n    A.   That's correct.\n    Q.   So, were you essentially extending the grade\nbeam out?\n    A.   We were.\n    Q.   Let's look at photograph 22 of Exhibit 21.\nIs that the same condition, just looking down the\ngrade beam line?\n    A.   That's correct.     You're seeing the hairpins\nthat were doweled into the existing grade beam and\nthe rebar that was run horizontal to support that\nbeam.\n    Q.   23; is that after the concrete pour?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And what is 24?\n    A.   Same thing, except with the door pockets.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

What about the architect, John Grable's,\ntime?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     All right.     If we look at Tri-Bar Exhibit\nNumber 9, I'll represent to you that this is the\nretainage draw that SBS submitted after they were\nterminated; so, the last draw we've received from\nthem.    If we look at the schedule of values for the\nbalance to finish, do you see that column?\n    A.     Sure.\n    Q.     What's the total balance to finish at that\npoint?\n    A.     480 grand, roughly.\n    Q.     All right.     And granted that all of the work\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

That is fair to say.\n    Q.   On the metal building, they originally\nscheduled $355,000.00 for that?\n    A.   Correct.\n    Q.   What percentage complete did they show?\n    A.   They showed a 98.51 percent complete.\n    Q.   Did that coincide with what you saw when you\ngot on the job site after they'd been terminated?\n    A.   Absolutely not.\n    Q.   What percentage complete would you say they\nwere at that point in time?\n    A.   60, 65.\n    Q.   And did you have to supervise work to\ncomplete the rest of the work?\n    A.   I did.\n    Q.   And did -- the costs were associated with\nthat, I take it?\n    A.   Absolutely.\n    Q.   Were those costs included in Exhibit Number\n19, the summary of offset claims?\n    A.

Does that -- is that roughly\nequivalent to the cost that you incurred in completing\nit?\n      A.   I'd say it's a little less.\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

Concrete stain, we obviously didn't stain the\nconcrete.      We installed epoxy, and so that's masonry\nCMU.    This one jumps out at me.       93.36 percent\ncomplete.      If you look at some of those pictures, I\nmean, the door pockets aren't even completed.\nPilasters don't go all the way up.

How much did it cost, roughly, for you to\ncomplete the masonry CMU and masonry stone work that\nwas necessary?\n       A.     It was -- it was substantially more than\nthat.       I'd say -- I want to say, John, it was 120 to\n150 grand.\n       Q.     Okay.\n       A.     Just for the CMU.   Not the stone; just the\nCMU.\n\n\n\n                        TAMI L.

That was taken out.\n    Q.     All right.    Were there some paint costs\nincurred?\n    A.     There were actually metal costs that were\nincurred.\n    Q.     Okay.   What were those costs, roughly?\n    A.     I'd say probably about $80,000.00 in metal,\neasy.\n    Q.     All right.    Plumbing; did you have plumbing\nexpenses to complete?\n    A.     We did.   In fact, we had to tear out and\nrelocate the majority of the plumbing that was already\nroughed-in to the slab.\n    Q.     And did you have -- why was that necessary?\n    A.     Part of it was their plumbing was in the\nwrong locations.     Another part of it was some of the\nchanges that had to do with the redesign of the\nproject.\n    Q.     Okay.

Over a hundred grand.\n    Q.   Okay.    They had -- SBS had, at the time of\nits termination, an estimate of $400,000.00 to\ncomplete the remaining scope of work at that time.\n    A.   Right.\n    Q.   How does that number compare, roughly, with\nwhat it cost for you to complete the remaining scope\nof work, without the additional work?\n    A.   Right.

Oh, it was way more.\n    Q.   Not including the additional work.   Just for\nthe original scope.\n    A.

If you do the deficiencies together with the\ncost to complete the original scope, what's the rough\nestimate of that cost, based on your work on the\nproject?\n    A.

What you're looking at is essentially\ndraws 3, 4, 5, and 6 of what Robertson billed for.\nSo, they billed for insurance, slab rough-in, light\nfixtures and install, electrical gear equipment and\ninstall.    So, if you're looking at draw 3, you're\nroughly looking at slab rough-in.      Okay.   They\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Light fixtures and installation.\nThere were light fixtures that were left on the site.\nAnd between myself and Bob Carnwath, we inventoried\nand reviewed those light fixtures and we determined\nthat the value of those things were approximately\n$10,000.00.   If you can see a typical markup on light\nfixtures is about 20 percent, bringing you to a value\nof 12,300.\n                Gear and equipment install; there was a\nlittle bit of gear that was left on the site.       Not\nmuch.   What they're billing for in this pay app\nspecifically is $5,120.00 for insurance and\nmobilization.    2,240 in addition to the 12,160 that\nthey had already earned.    So, my assessment was, even\nif they marked up the $10,000.00 in light fixtures at\n20 percent, you know, that 2240 was -- was slightly\nabove reasonable to bill for here.\n                Branch conduit and wire; they're billing\nfor $11,100.00 in conduit and wire.     We valued --\nmyself and Bob valued the amount of conduit and wire\nthat was installed as far as branch circuits was\nroughly $3,000.00.    The temporary power they're\nbilling for here, there was no temporary power to the\nbuilding.    There was no line that was run.   We\nactually had to go in and trench our own line from\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So,\nI'm not quite sure what they were billing for there.\n              If you look at draw 4, you take all\nthose numbers from draw 3 and move them over one\ncolumn to the left.   Light fixture install; they're\nbilling for another $11,200.00.     As we already\ndiscussed, that was excessive for what was provided\non-site or left on-site.    Gear and equipment install;\nthere wasn't anything installed, so I didn't feel like\nthat money should have been allocated to a fair amount\nto pay out.   Branch conduit and wire again; we only\nvalued it at about $3600.00 worth of work completed.\nAnd temporary power, again, for $1250.00.       There was\nno temporary power.\n              Draw 5, demobilization.       I estimate that\n$6,000.00 for demobilizing from Uvalde to San Antonio\nis a little high, so we deducted a thousand dollars\nfrom that and came up with a fair amount of\napproximately 5000.\n    Q.   Okay.   And one more draw.\n    A.   Draw 6.   They drew another $1280.00 for\ninsurance and mobilization.    We got $1150.00 for slab\nrough-in.   There was no contest to that.      2560 in\nlight fixtures and install.    You know, this is\nobviously retainage adjusted to what we felt was\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

We took out\ncompletely because we had no evidence of temporary\npower ever being on-site.\n    Q.     So, the lien amount as reflected in Exhibit\nNumber 62 is $60,990.00.

I'm just\ngoing to look at the amount of their bid compared to\nthe amount of Robertson's bid and see how the\ndifference compares to Mr. Boddie's -- I'm not going\nto ask him anything about C&S other than what's the\namount.\n                THE COURT:    Well, if C&S's contract\namount is 128 --\n                MR.

When you reviewed C&S Enterprises'\nproposal, you indicated that it's roughly -- should be\n$76,000.00; right?\n    A.   C&S's proposal?\n    Q.   Uh-huh.   That's one of the last questions you\nwere asked.\n    A.   Right.    Their proposal states $76,486.75.\n    Q.   And that would be what you would expect the\ncontract to be; correct?\n    A.   Not necessarily.\n    Q.   Why wouldn't it be?\n    A.   Well, it's going to depend on what set of\ndrawings that they're contracted to.\n    Q.   So, if the proposal that they're doing is\ndifferent from the contract that they're doing, then\nthe contract might be different?\n    A.   Repeat that again.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

If the proposal is based on a certain number\nof plans and information that a contract is supposedly\nbased on, then the contract should be for the same\namount as the proposal; correct?\n    A.     Yes.    Your proposal will match a -- typically\na set of drawings.\n    Q.     And if it's not, then it would change;\ncorrect?\n    A.     Correct.\n    Q.     So, then, you would expect that if the\nproposal is for the same amount of work that you bid\non, then the contract amount should be for that\namount; correct?\n    A.     If it's tied to the same contract documents.\n    Q.     Correct.    So, would you be able to understand\n-- I want you to go to -- I'll get you Plaintiff's\nExhibit 22-A.      At the very top where it says contract\namount, what's the amount that's stated there?\n    A.     Total contract amount looks like 115,163.\n    Q.     Certainly different from the proposal amount;\nright?\n    A.     Sure.\n    Q.     So, either the contract is written on a\ndifferent set of work or somebody increased the value\non the proposal; right?\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Well, I think -- I think where you may be\nconfused is, you're not seeing any kind of increase on\nhere for changes, so --\n    Q.     Well, that's not true.\n    A.     Look at the date on here, 7/25/13.\n    Q.     7/25/13.\n    A.     Versus the date on the other one.        So, the\nplans changed from 7/25 to whatever the -- Exhibit 44\nwas introduced -- which it's dated January 14th of\n2013.    You're talking about six months of difference\nwhen a building changed pretty substantially.\n    Q.     You agree with me, the contract amount\ndoesn't change?\n    A.     Why would it not?     Your contract amount is an\nabsorption of your original contract plus change\norders.\n    Q.     The contract is what the -- the work you\nagreed to perform is for; right?\n    A.     No.\n    Q.     It's not?\n    A.     So, what you're not understanding and what\nI'm saying is, you can have an original contract\namount and a current contract amount.          You're looking\nat a bill from C&S that has a total contract amount.\nTo me, that says that he's got an original contract\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

I see draw 1, draw 2, draw 3, draw 4, draw 5,\nbalance due.\n    Q.     If you look right below the total contract\namount, the next line says, extras to date.     Do you\nsee that?\n    A.     Sure.\n    Q.     How much is reflected in extras to date?\n    A.     Well, I'm having a real hard time reading\nthat.    I'm going to guess it's either 27 or 37.\n    Q.     It's $87,893.00.\n    A.     Okay.\n    Q.     And it reflects at the bottom line -- the\nnext sentence underneath that says, \"And the total new\ncontract amount is $203,056.00\"; right?\n    A.     Sure.\n    Q.     Now, go to 22-B, which is the very next one.\n    A.     (Witness complying.)\n    Q.     Do you see it?\n    A.     I do.\n    Q.

That's decisively more than 128,000; wouldn't\nyou agree?\n    A.     128 being Robertson's contract?\n    Q.     That's correct.\n    A.     That's correct.\n    Q.

Well, light fixtures -- if the light fixtures\nwere called to be in one specific location and then\nthat had changed, then it would have to be in a\ndifferent location when you got there; right?\n    A.

Mr. Boddie, you mentioned a change that was\ndone to part of the roofing system, and you said, if I\nunderstood you correctly in your testimony, that all\nthat stuff has got to be approved by the metal\nbuilding company before you can do it.         Did I\nunderstand your testimony correctly?\n       A.   I believe I was referring to welding of the\nbeams to columns.\n       Q.   Okay.

That's the binder that\ncompiles 19, 20, and 21.      And quickly, tabs 33, 34,\nand 35 of that binder, are those all electrical\ndefects with certain costs associated with them?\n      A.

That book.\n       A.     \"Remove existing wire to 120 volt wall outlet\nin hangar area and replace with larger wire to allow\nfor voltage drop.\"         Yes, I would say that would be a\ndefect.      Tab 34, \"Reconfigure wall outlets and J-boxes\nfor required louvers and masonry block walls in hangar\nareas to reflect engineering drawings.\"           Yes, I would\nsay that's a defect.

Well, Glacier Cap was the construction\nmanager, which was the liaison between GC and the\nowner, Tri-Bar.    Then in February of 2013, that\nrelationship changed when SBS was terminated as the\nGC.   Glacier Cap Management then assumed the role as\nthe GC until the project's end.\n      Q.

No, sir.\n    Q.   Or an arbitration?\n    A.   No, sir.    Nothing.\n    Q.   Or even a mediation?\n    A.   No, sir.\n    Q.

Thank you.\n    Q.   (BY MR. JONES)     Mr. Mowrer, what is\nExhibit 19?\n    A.   This is a spreadsheet that was put together\nby Glacier Cap personnel listing invoices,\ncontractors, invoice numbers, and the type of work\nthat had to be done to correct work that was done by\nSBS that was not according to design.\n    Q.   Okay.   And were the invoices actually paid by\nGlacier Cap?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Based upon your review and analysis of the\ninvoices submitted by the various subcontractors\nassociated with this work that's described in\nExhibit 19, what is the total amount that Tri-Bar paid\nto correct or remediate SBS's work?\n    A.   $317,995.74.\n    Q.   I'm going to switch gears again on you.   Did\nGlacier Cap also make payments to -- I'm sorry -- did\nGlacier Cap also make payments to the subcontractors\n-- some of the subcontractors of SBS after they were\nterminated?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And if you would, turn to Exhibit 28 in that\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

There's another notebook up there\nthat's called SBS.    Let's look at that one.   Looking\nat Exhibit 23, there's a listing of the -- of the\npayments that were made.     And you can also look at it\non the screen, if you'd like.     The amounts paid\ndirectly by Tri-Bar.     Is that what actually was paid\nby Tri-Bar?\n    A.   Looks like it.     Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   And why were -- why did you authorize\n-- or why did someone authorize and direct you to pay\nthese invoices for subcontractors that were working\nwhile SBS was on the property?\n    A.   Well, the general manager at the time that\nwas working for us worked with the subcontractors to\ncontinue the construction of the project.    So, when\nSBS was terminated, we worked with a subcontractor to\nsee if they would still continue the project so we\ncould get the project done in a timely manner, and\nthey agreed.   So, we just made direct payment to them.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And did you also obtain lien releases\nfrom those subcontractors?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   I know it's tempting, but you need to\nwait for me to finish my question.\n    A.   Okay.\n    Q.   You know what I'm going to say, but the court\nreporter has a hard time taking down two people\ntalking at once.    And would that be shown in\nExhibit 29 in the SBS notebook -- I'm sorry -- the\nTri-Bar notebook?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   I'm going to take this notebook away\nfrom you for a minute so you don't have to worry about\nthat one.   I'm going to change over to now the pay\napplication process that was used for Tri-Bar.

A little bit less than six months, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    And did it have a specific number\nof days -- 173 days?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Okay.   And looking at draw request number 1,\nthat was paid; correct?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   And now, if you look at Exhibit 2, that's\nanother -- another SBS payment application.   Was that\nalso paid?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   So, roughly after two months, you had -- or\nTri-Bar has paid approximately $200,000.00?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   All right.    And turning now to pay app number\n3, what is the amount of that pay app?\n    A.   The work completed for that period was\n$31,000.00.\n    Q.   Did that -- as a controller of a project that\nhas a timeline, did that concern you?\n    A.   Yes, sir.\n    Q.   Why?\n    A.

So, for cash\nbudgeting, you're looking at about $200,000.00 per\nmonth.    And after the first two months, we only saw\n$200,000.00 in progress billings.     We expected to see\n4.   And after this third pay app, this was only\n$31,000.00.   So, we were only at $231,000.00 in\nprogressive billings when we expected to be up to\nabout $600,000.00.\n     Q.    And did you -- were you, in fact, instructed\nto hold on to this pay app for a while to see if any\nwork was going to be done?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    All right.

If you'll turn with me to tab 36 -- or\nExhibit 36, that is a letter from Mr. Grable in\nconnection with pay app 3; is that correct?\n     A.    Yes, sir.\n     Q.    All right.

Yes, sir.\n    Q.    What is the amount of that pay app?\n    A.    $3,541.66.\n    Q.    And what month are we in now?\n    A.

So, that's how many months from inception of\nconstruction?\n    A.    That's four months.\n    Q.    All right.    Did this concern you, that you\nwere receiving an invoice for only $3,541.66 in month\nfour of this project?\n    A.    Yes, sir.\n    Q.    Why?\n    A.    Total pay apps for four months only\naccumulated to about 240 or $250,000.00.        After four\nmonths, I would expect it to be about $800,00.00 into\nthe contract by now.

(BY MR. JONES)     There's been some talk in\nthis trial about Mr. Lewis issuing a stop payment\nedict in October.      Make no more payments to this\ncompany until we see something going on.        And we knew\nnothing about it.      Nobody told SBS.    Nobody told\nanybody.   Pittman never told us.       Nobody ever told us.\nIs that true?\n    A.     No, sir.\n    Q.     What does Exhibit 71 show?\n    A.     It's a letter dated November 10th, 2012.        And\nit states in here that the owner is holding back draws\nuntil SBS can deliver PEMB as scheduled, and cc SBS\nconstruction Jack Green.\n    Q.     Okay.   Well, Mr. Grable approved the draw\napplication, so why is the owner holding it?\n    A.     Well, the -- at this point the work was\ncompleted, but they were still way behind schedule.\nSo, we were just holding off the payment until they\nwould get substantially caught up with some work.          And\nat this point, at 11/10 when this letter was dated, we\nstill had not even received the metal for the erection\n\n\n\n                       TAMI L.

Why were those pay apps now paid in January\nof 2013 after the delays?\n       A.   We were waiting for substantial completion of\nSBS to correct the metal structure.

Why?\n    A.   The GC, SBS, was terminated as the GC.     And\nalso the work that was done was considered substandard\nand not to the design that was specified.\n    Q.   And when did this pay app come in?\n    A.   This pay app would have crossed my desk\nsomewhere -- period ending December 31st, 2012.    So, I\nwould have got it probably mid to late January --\nprobably mid-January I would have gotten it.\n    Q.

And for my client, it's been two and a half\nplus years waiting.     And the reality here is that we\nhave come to learn more about what happened in the\nlast, really, month because of information that was\nturned over.\n                The reality here is that Robertson\nElectric entered into an agreement to do electrical\nwork for SBS, who was under contract to do work for\nTri-Bar, who was owned by Rod Lewis.          During the\ncourse and scope of all this, he enters into the\nagreement, begins to work as he's supposed to; and lo\nand behold, he comes back in December, receives\nanother plan.      Simply sits down with the plan, begins\n\n\n\n                      TAMI L.

He alerts the\nproper channels at SBS; say, look, there are changes\nhere.    There are things that are not in the original\nplans.   And they tell them, submit the change order.\nHe does exactly what he's supposed to do.\n               Little did he know that doing what he's\nsupposed to do would literally lead in this.      Because\n-- because he puts them on notice for doing what it\nappears, and I believe the evidence supports, is the\npattern and practice of Tri-Bar.     They want something\nfor nothing.   And if they will connive, congeal,\ndeceive, they will do each and every last one of those\nthings to accomplish it.\n               They want this Court to believe that the\nreason for his termination and the termination of his\nbusiness is because his price order and what he was\nproposing to do was too much.    During the entire scope\nof this trial, they never explain how he gets -- how\nthat particular document gets to him.       They know it's\nturned over.   How were things changed?     Why were\nthings changed?   Why was it sent to him without the\nproper indication showing there had been revisions?\nSilence.\n               But then they have the gall to say what\nhe's supposed to do is do it either for nothing or for\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

They say\nit's too high.    Well, they never said what they think\nit should be.    They just keep saying it's too high.\nAnd so, he's working.    And then we get -- during the\nentire scope and course of this trial, we've had at\nleast six, if not seven, alleged reasons for his\ntermination.    One was during the scope of this matter\n-- it was because his billing practice was supposedly\nstrange.    The Court heard the arguments here in our\nmotion for summary judgment.    That's what they said.\nNot one shred of evidence about it.     Not one.\n                The next was, well, it's just he didn't\nman it.    But when Pittman, who I must admit, I've\nwanted to get at Pittman for at least two years.       It\nwas somewhat refreshing and somewhat disappointing at\nthe same time to get to talk to him.        Because he makes\nno sense.    He's certainly not honest.     And the reality\nhere is, what he says is, well, I had all these\nconcerns about Robertson Electric.     They didn't man\nappropriately.    They didn't man in November.     He was\nshocked to find out my client wasn't even there in\nNovember.    Didn't have to be there in November.     So,\nhe was engaged in fabrication.     That's what he was\ndoing; just fabricating.    He was engaged in the\nprocess of locating other subcontractors to include\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Well, at this point\nin the game, we don't even know what work they were\ndoing, and we really don't know what it is that was\nsupposed to be done cheaper, allegedly.     We do know\nthat their contract was priced $30,000.00 more than\nwhat they proposed to do it for.     We do know that on\ntop of that, when it ends up, the entire cost of their\ncontract is 215,000 plus.    But some of that is\nunderstood because the real reality is that Rod Lewis\nis engaged in a habit of the constant re-change,\nre-adoption of the work site.    And that happened.\n               But the reality is, what was left out of\nwhat they proposed my client identified.     And that is,\nin his change orders he identified the work that had\nto be done.    And when he looked at the work that they\nproposed had to be done in the proposal, he looked and\ncould identify, these are the things that aren't being\nidentified.    These are the things that have to be\ndone.\n               What they then do and what Tri-Bar does\nis they get Mr. Boddie.    And Mr. Boddie wants to come\nacross as neutral and wants to come across as a, quote\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

His sole\nobjective was to try and fabricate information.        But\nthe reality is, when asked, what did you consider,\nwell, in one instance, well, I didn't investigate\nthat.   I just thought.   You're making recommendations\nthat you consider, but you're not showing that you\nconsidered anything.    You don't know where he lives,\nso you don't know where he demobilizes to.       You don't\nknow what anything is.    What did you consider?       Did\nyou look at the contracts?    What was supposed to be\ndone?   He was evasive.   Why?   Because he wasn't up\nthere to really assist this Court and give expert\ninformation, to guide the Court or to guide the\nfactfinder as to what may very well be.       He was there\nto present the side of Tri-Bar.     And the side of\nTri-Bar is just fiction, if nothing else.\n                The scope of their argument is this:\nEverybody else is to abide by the contract but them.\nEvery witness that they put up there -- did you see\nour contract?    Did you see what you're supposed to do?\nThis is what you're supposed to do.      This is how\nyou're supposed to do it.    But it's their contract.\nThey're supposed to know it better than anybody else.\nAnd they didn't abide by it at all.\n                And so, their saving grace really is\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

That's\ntheir argument.   But my client abided by this\ncontract.   He documented.   He followed it.    He did\neverything he was supposed to do.     He worked.   And\nwhat they want to say is, well, now there's some\nthings that he did wrong.    Things that they never --\nlet's assume for the moment that what they're saying\nis true.    Let's assume he did some things wrong.     You\nnever tell him?   You're so concerned about something\nbeing done right that you don't alert somebody to,\nokay, possibly something was done wrong?\n               Our contention and my client's position\nsaid, no, he didn't do anything wrong.      He took\npictures of the site when he left it.       He followed the\ncontract -- the original plan to the letter.       And when\nhe was terminated, he made it a point to say, tell me\nwhat I did, if I did anything.     Contacts SBS; what did\nI do?   Initially, there's no response.     But they\neventually tell him, you did nothing wrong.      He gets a\ncall and they tell him the reason -- real reason they\nwant you gone is because they want to go with somebody\nelse.\n               Well, we now know that that was in\nprogress, at a minimum, since October.      But we know\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

They never\naccount for the fact that they didn't trench.      They\nnever account for the fact they didn't permit.      They\nnever account for the fact that they're the cause of\nany alleged delay that my client had.       And the -- the\ntestimony uncontroverted from SBS is that, at a\nminimum, he's on progress.    He's where he's supposed\nto be.   From my client, says, I was ahead of where I\nwas supposed to be.    I was waiting for work.    And on\nthat, he sends out an e-mail and says, hey, I'm being\nheld up.    I need -- these things are the things\nholding me up.    Let me know when it can be corrected,\nso I can get it done.    As far as documentation is\nconcerned, again, he's the one that did it.\n                So, we have established a breach of\ncontract.   And we've established there's been tortious\ninterference.    In order for Tri-Bar to establish their\nposition of justification, what they have got to show\n-- because it's their burden -- is that that -- not\njust that -- they state, well, we had a superior\nright.   We had a superior interest.    You can state you\ncan fly.    You've got to prove you can.\n                And the reality is, that definitely\ndidn't happen with Mr. Pittman.     Because Mr. Pittman\ncould not establish any of the things that they allege\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

The right arises from their contract to\ndo whatever it is they're going to do and whatever it\nis they're going to assert.    Their contract expressly\nsays that there is no flow-down provision and there is\nno contractual obligation established.      That's what\ntheir contract says.    It also says that in order for\nthem to assert themselves into it, there's\ndocumentation that they're required to do.     There are\nnotices.\n                Well, if there are legitimate problems --\nand I think there certainly was some concerns -- why\ndon't they just put it in writing?     They sent all\nthese e-mails, so it's not like it wasn't possible for\nthem to write.    Why didn't they?   Because that wasn't\ntheir real concern.    Their real concern, when you look\nthrough their correspondence, is they wanted to screw\nover SBS.   And they didn't care who they hurt in the\nprocess.    They wanted to reassume, for whatever\nreason, and that's what's in their e-mails.     It's not\nanything I'm manufacturing.    It's what they write.\n                They hurt my client, who was innocent,\nin the progress.    And then they try to come up with\nall these alleged matters.    They are really saying, on\none issue, to give them, again, the benefit of their\nargument that basically 3,000 or $4,000.00 worth of\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Really, that's their\n-- that's their position on that.    And their position\nis, well, because of a change order that you told us\nabout -- we didn't tell you about; you told us\nabout -- that you're pricing it too high.    They never\ntell anybody it's being priced too high until they get\nin a phone conversation with Mr. Green or Mr.\nSchiffman.   And they don't put that in writing.\n              They say that we're motivated by economic\ninterest because C&S Enterprises can perform the\nduties cheaper.   You can't tell it by the cost.    You\ncan't tell it by the items they left out.    And there's\nsome question as to whether we are talking apples and\noranges, because of the constant state of flux of the\nwork that needed to be done.   Even in their last\nexhibit, the exhibit dealing with the change from a\none level to two level was a change between\ninformation in less than a month.    Because if you take\nhis testimony as true, then on January 23rd, this\nthing is one level.   By February 15th, it's\nconstructed to be two level.\n              So, I don't know.

The first -- the tortious\ninterference is definitely against Tri-Bar.\n             THE COURT:      Uh-huh.\n             MR. BROWN:      The other springs out because\nof the conduct that occurs during the course.          And\nthat is, their contract expressly provides that they\ncould have assumed control over the subcontractor.\nAnd they do that by putting it in writing and notice.\nThey could have done it.     They didn't.    But it's clear\nthat's what they did.     They -- Mr. Pittman terminates\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

They assumed\nthat role.   They replaced the subcontractor.      And they\nhad that right only after they tortiously interfered.\nThat's when it sprang out.    That's when it occurred.\n               Before then, they could not have done\nwhat they did.    But after which, because the way their\ncontract is structured, is when it does occur.      And a\nthat is why we believe that there is an oral contract\nthat establishes at that point the existence of an\nobligation that they owed to Robertson Electric for\nperformance.   So, there are two --\n               THE COURT:   A contractual obligation by\nthem terminating SBS and then stepping in as --\n               MR. BROWN:   Not terminating SBS.

But\nthere was a provision that they had to obtain the\narchitectural certification, they had to give the\nrequisite notice, and then they could have done it,\nunder their own contract.      They didn't.    But I believe\nthe Court, in equity, has the right to assume or can\ntake charge of the fact that that's what they did do\nand deal with the reality of the situation.\n                And so, those are the two theories that\nwe have.    Again, there's no question they tortiously\ninterfered.   The issue -- the other, again, occurs\nafter the tortious interference.        And again, I\nresearched that point.       Both can occur.

After that, then they\nhave to give the requisite notice to SBS of seven\ndays, which does not flow.\n               The next thing is, under the owner's\nright to stop work, which is 2.3, and then the owner's\nright to carry out the work, which is 2.4; that is\nwhere it states that if the -- if the contractor here\ndefaults or neglects to carry out the work, then after\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And that is,\nin essence, what Pittman testified to.       That's what he\nsaid.    That's what he did.    That's why he did what he\ndid.\n                And so, it is at that point that the\ncontract, at least the oral contract and their\nassumption into that right and into that role takes\nplace.   But again, it occurs after they engaged in a\ntortious interference.       So, our position --\n                THE COURT:    You're saying that they took\n-- the tortious interference began -- what you're\nsaying is -- rolling down the hill -- where they told\nSBS, you get rid of Robertson or you're gone?\n                MR. BROWN:    Right.   And that occurs\nJanuary 14th.\n                THE COURT:    So, is that taking control of\nthe contract at that time?      Is Pittman being agent for\nthe owner?\n                MR. BROWN:    No.   They take --\n                THE COURT:    No?\n                MR.

How does that help\nRobertson?\n                MR. BROWN:   Well, what it does is that it\nestablishes two avenues of relief.        Under the tortious\ninterference, the damages are the same.       The case law\nmakes it clear that when you look at the damages for\ntortious interference --\n                THE COURT:   Just see if you can connect\nup -- do you have any contractual rights?\n                MR.

We kind of\nhave to start there.    Your Honor, I'm going to be\ntalking about Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1 and\nPlaintiff's Exhibit Number 17.     I'm going to start\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

I'm going to\ngo through it right quick.    Was it a termination for\n-- for cause?    And I think the answer is no,\nestablished by the evidence, established straight out\nof Mr. Grable's mouth.    Because under 14.2.2, the\nwording here is crucial.    That the owner may terminate\nthe contract if one of four conditions exist.      Mr.\nPittman tried to claim that number 1 was the one that\nexisted; that it repeatedly refuses or fails to supply\nenough proper skilled workers or proper materials.\n14.2.2 says when any of these conditions exist, and\nMr. Pittman said it existed, then upon certification\nby the initial decision maker, Grable, and sufficient\ncause exists to justify such action, then we get to\nthe next part.\n                But let's just stop right there.   Because\nI asked Mr. Grable, did you send the notice; he said\nno.   Ms. Brazell actually asked Mr. Grable, did you\nsend -- were you instructed by Mr. Pittman, the\nowner's representative, to say that there were not\nenough workers out there; and he said, yeah, I was\ninstructed to do that.    Why didn't you send the 72\nnotice?   Because I felt we could get it worked out;\nthat we had gotten past these issues.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                           357\n\n\n\n\n                So, not only did Mr. Grable, the initial\ndecision maker, not issue the certification; he\nrefused to issue the certification and didn't.       Not\njust accidently or negligently, which actually is what\nI thought was going to happen when we came in here.\nBut on purpose because he thought we had gotten past\nthe issue.   And that was a request from the owner as\nan owner's directive.\n                Now, if you look at that -- the rest of\nthat clause, it says, then they also have to give the\ncontractor seven days notice.        We know that didn't\nhappen either.    The words mean something that there\nare two conditions that must be met and neither one of\nthem got met.    Now, what's kind of interesting about\nthis is --\n                THE COURT:   Who's the decision maker?\n                MR. CLARK:   The initial decision maker is\nthe architect.\n                THE COURT:   Architect?     Okay.\n                MR. CLARK:   And that's in the contract\ndocuments.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.\n                MR. CLARK:   So, the initial decision\nmaker is the architect, Mr. Grable.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.    I remember that.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So, the -- what's\ninteresting about this provision, 14.2.2, is that what\nthe owner may do in this paragraph is not terminate\nthe contract right here.   It says that the owner may\n-- after they do those -- if they get the\ncertification and give the notice, they may terminate\nemployment of the contractor and may -- and then\nthere's three things they can do; finish the work,\ncollect for damages, and recover costs in excess of\nthe contract price.   Then the contract terminates.\n              Contrast that -- let's compare -- when\nyou look at the termination for convenience.    Your\nHonor, here is the termination for convenience clause\non the next page, the 14.2.1.\n              THE COURT:   But still as factfinder, the\nCourt considers whether they had cause under 14.2.1;\nright?   The -- repeatedly refuses or fails to supply\nenough properly skilled workers.\n              MR. CLARK:   Correct.   They -- I didn't --\nI was not even going to get to that issue, but\nobviously they have to have proven that first.    And I\nthink there was contradictory evidence as to whether\nwe had -- as to whether SBS had repeatedly refused to\nput skilled workers out there.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

CLARK:    It is.    It is.   But then for\nthe termination for cause, then you have to have those\nother two conditions as well.\n               THE COURT:    Right.    But you say it's for\nconvenience because they found a better supplier?\n               MR. CLARK:    It doesn't matter what reason\nthey had.    They could have just not liked Mr.\nSchiffman.   They could have just not liked the answers\nthey were getting.    They could have just not liked\nanything about SBS.    Mr. Lewis could have just gotten\nup and said, I don't like the color of their shirts.\nAnd a termination for convenience requires absolutely\nno reason at all.\n               THE COURT:    Right.\n               MR. CLARK:    Zero.    Which is why that is\nnot a breach if he --\n               THE COURT:    But the facts you developed\nwas, they found a cheaper price or whatever.\n               MR. CLARK:    It was.   I like to find a\nmotivation in people and not believe that they do\nthings willy-nilly.    But it really doesn't matter why\nhe did it.   It was just done.\n               THE COURT:    No, I understand.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

CLARK:    And so, he can terminate the\ncontract at any time for convenience without cause.\nNow, in that case, it's not terminate the employment\nof the contract.    In 14.4.1, it's terminate the\ncontract for the owner's convenience.        And when that\nhappens, the contractor is given no rights.        The\ncontractor says, cease operations.      Don't bill\nanymore.    Don't incur any more costs.      And then the\nremedy -- there's one remedy, and it's in 14.4.3.          The\ncontractor shall be entitled to receive payment for\nwork executed, costs incurred by reason of\ntermination, along with reasonable overhead profit and\nwork not executed.    That's it.    So, under a\ntermination for convenience, it's a termination of the\ncontract.    And a termination of the contract is like\nbeing dead.   You either are or you aren't and the\ncontract is dead.\n               And so, when the owner terminated the\ncontract, the contractor, SBS, had nothing else to do.\nWe offered to do some stuff.     But we didn't have any\nmore obligations under the contract.         At the same\ntime, they didn't have any more rights under the\ncontract.    When you terminate it, it's terminated.\nIt's done.    There's no other clauses in that 14.4.        If\nyou look back in 14.2, Your Honor, you'll see that\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

Okay.    Those aren't -- those words are not\npresent over in the termination for convenience.      They\nare present if it's a termination for cause.\n                 THE COURT:   Yes, sir.\n                 MR. CLARK:   And the same thing was kind\nof true with -- if you look in 14.4.3, the termination\nfor convenience when it says they get payment; it\ndoesn't say except as provided elsewhere.      It doesn't\nsay without prejudice to the rights of others.      It\ndoesn't say subject to this section or that section or\nsomething else.     Like it does under the termination\nfor cause.   And Mr. Slates got up in his opening\nstatement and said, you remember how this fits under\nparagraph 12 of the AIA contract, where it talks about\nprior to substantial completion X, Y, and Z, and the\nowner can do this, that, and the other.      X, Y, and Z\ntalks about substantial completion; before or after\nsubstantial completion.       It doesn't say, if we find\nsomething after termination, then we can do this.        The\nonly thing that talks about what happens after\ntermination is if there's a termination for cause.         If\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

It's over.   It's done\nwith.   You have to add words to the contract in order\nto get where Mr. Slates wants to go.\n               Not to mention, under 14.2.4, which is\nthe termination for cause; if you look down at the\nvery bottom of what happens at the very end when we're\nat today's point.    14.2.4 says that two things are\nsupposed to happen.    The contractor is supposed to\nsubmit a final pay application to the architect.       We\ndid it.    Mr. Grable got -- the documents are in\nevidence.    We delivered them to Mr. Grable.   Mr.\nGrable admitted he got our pay applications 7, 8, and\n9.   Then the owner is to submit any costs that he has\nunder that termination to the architect.      And it\nsays -- the very last sentence says, the amount to be\npaid shall be certified by the architect, the initial\ndecision maker, upon application.      And this obligation\nshall survive termination of the contract.\n               So, even if this was a termination for\ncause, our application is in Mr. Grable's pocket.\nThey never put on any evidence at all that they put\ntheir application in front of Mr. Grable.     Mr. Grable\nis not a Tri-Bar employee.     He's not with Glacier\nCapital.    The fact that they have a document that Mr.\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                    PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            363\n\n\n\n\nMowrer created or Ms. Swisher created or whoever that\nhas numbers on it doesn't put it in Mr. Grable's\nhands.   14.2.4 says it's got to be in Mr. Grable's\nhands.   And that obligation shall survive termination\nof the contract.\n              So, whether it's termination for cause,\nthey didn't comply with the elements and put their\nnumbers in front of Mr. Grable.     And if it was a\ntermination for convenience, then there's nothing that\ngives them the right to an offset.\n              So, what happened in this case?       I think\nwhat happened in this case was that the termination\nwas done as a matter of convenience.        I think Mr.\nPittman kind of flew off the handle and just said,\nfire them, get rid of them, and made it happen.       I\ndon't think they went back to the attorneys again to\ndo it -- to do it right.    I think they could have done\nit right, but they didn't do it right.\n              And then after the fact, when Mr.\nSchiffman and Mr. Morgan didn't just go off into the\nnight and eat their loss, that's when Mr. Pittman came\nback and said, I'm going to crush them.       And now the\nprices escalate.   But you heard Mr. Pittman.      He said\nhe was out there all the time.     Whether he was or\nwasn't, I don't know.

If he was out there all the time, he\nshould have seen these other defects.      Because they\nwere not obvious to him in November, December, and\nJanuary when he was out there all the time.     But as\nsoon as SBS is gone and he walks the property, all of\na sudden, they're obvious.    You can see the building\nleaning from left to right.   One of those two things\nisn't right.   And so, either Mr. Pittman wasn't doing\nhis job before, and then just started to do his job\nafter the termination, or he was doing his job all\nalong and knew that this is how construction projects\nlook at this particular stage of the -- of the\nconstruction and didn't have any problems with it\nuntil he decided to issue the termination.\n               And you heard Erick Key from Schulte come\nin.   He does metal buildings all the time.    He's\nfamiliar with the roof system that SBS -- that SBS\nputs on.   He looked at every one of those -- most of\nthose pictures and said, yeah, those are temporary.\nThose are not the finished product.    Yeah, that looks\nsloppy now, but they're going to put gutters over it\nand they're going to put this.

Yes.\nIn fact, Schulte does their metal roofs one way and\nSBS does their buildings -- their metal roof slightly\ndifferent.    Does that mean one is wrong?     No.   It just\nmeans one does it one way and one does it the other.\n                Were there problems on this job?      Yes.    I\nthink the best description came in one of the e-mails.\nIt was actually an e-mail that Mr. Boddie wrote.        It's\nExhibit 71.   Where he said it appears the problems\nwere the result of miscommunication.        I think that's\nan understatement.    We have people talking past each\nother and nobody knew exactly what they were supposed\nto be doing because we had plans going back and forth\nand I don't think anybody was communicating.         They\nwere talking, but they weren't communicating.\n                There were obviously multiple reasons why\nthe project was delayed.    And was there fault on both\nsides?   I think absolutely there was.      I think we have\npeople that are holding payment.     People that knew the\nconcrete needed to get paid.    People that could have\npaid the concrete people.    People that were standing\non principle.    And I think a lot of egos got in the\nway here and things didn't gel.\n                But were the delays a big issue?      No.\nMr. Morgan said in paragraph 4.3 when they got to the\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Yes.\nThey all had notice issues.    They all could have -- we\ncould have stopped work.    They could have terminated\nus.   They could have suspended work.       Everybody could\nhave -- could have done something or should have done\nsomething or would have done something if, if, if.\nWhat happened was what we've got.     And that was,\neverybody kind of kept moving along.        And as Mr.\nGrable said, they tried to get past the issue.       And\nso, you get down to the point where you end up with a\ntermination that has to be for convenience because the\ncause elements don't exist.\n               Was it a great business decision for Mr.\nLewis?   No.   He -- we have a guaranteed maximum\ncontract; $1.2 million.    If he really spent\n$4 million, as was suggested -- and I don't think the\nnumbers add up that high.    I think it's more like 1.8.\nBut if he really spent $1.8 million to get this\nproject done, he really should have stuck with SBS\nbecause we were going to end up having to finish it\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So, the damages that he incurred\nwere brought on by himself.     He had us under contract.\nAnd he had us with a guaranteed maximum.      No matter\nwhat we were billing, we were going to be stuck with\nit.   We were going to be doing work for free.\n                Now, as to Robertson; did SBS breach the\ncontract with Robertson?     We terminated.   We didn't\nhave a right.    I think the answer is yes.   We really\nhaven't contested that at all ever since the beginning\nof this case.    We've always told them that it was at\nTri-Bar's instructions.     You know, I found it kind of\nhumorous when Mr. Slates asked his question of Mr.\nRobertson and said, now did SBS give you written\nnotice of this termination?     No.   Did you know that\nSBS is complaining about lack of written notice about\nus?   Yeah.   But the difference is, we admit that we\nbreached the contract with Robertson because we didn't\ngive him notice.    We could have gone through and found\nsomething or made up a reason.      We just did what we\nwere told.    Theirs is the same way.    They didn't give\nus notice.    That's a breach of contract or it's a\ntermination for convenience.\n                One of the questions I have that -- that\nMr. Brown did not raise is, in Exhibit 68 that they\nthrew up here on the last day, they go through and\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

And we've gone through and done all\nthese offsets and we show that in -- that by our\ncalculations, he's only owed 12.     And that was in\nMarch of 2013.    We're now in March of 2015.   Why in\nthe world, if you admit that you owe him $12,000.00,\ndid you not send him a check for $12,000.00?    Doesn't\nhave to have a lien release.    Doesn't have to have\nanything else.    If you owe him the $12,000.00, send\nhim the $12,000.00.    We'll fight over the difference.\nI can't answer that question.    I think it's a -- I\nthink they should have done that.\n                In our contract with Robertson; do we owe\nhim $869,000.00?    No.   We have a pay-when-paid clause.\nAnd obviously, the owner was holding payments in part\nbecause of something Robertson did, so there's nothing\nwrong with the way that we have the clause written.\nHow much is Robertson owed for the breach of contract?\nWe have an exclusive remedy provision that has the\ndamage numbers in it.     And he's owed for the work and\nmaterial that he had out there on site.     He billed us\n$54,996.00.   That's what we've included in all of our\napplications.    That's what we think we are required to\npay him, if and when we recover from Tri-Bar.    If we\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

CLARK:    996.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. CLARK:    There was an additional\n$6,000.00 that he had for demobilization cost.     But\nthe demobilization is a consequential damage.    And\nunder 11.04 of our contract with Mr. Robertson, he's\nnot entitled to get consequential damages from us.\nMight the $6,000.00 be something that he could recover\nas tortious interference damages from Tri-Bar?     Yes.\nThat would fit legally under that.     So -- but as far\nas the measure of damages, Mr. Robertson said that the\ncost to complete by C&S was the same or more than his\ncontract amount.   And looking at the measure of\ndamages, he's then not entitled to any extra damages\nfrom SBS.\n              On attorney's fees, when you get Mr.\nBrown's application for attorney's fees and you see\nmine, you'll see that when it comes to segregation of\nattorney's fees, you'll see that the bulk of Mr.\nBrown's time was spent on his issues with Tri-Bar; not\nSBS.   You'll see that the motions to compel discovery\nthat he was talking about were not filed against SBS.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

So, I would say that maybe 10, 15 percent\nof Mr. Brown's total attorney's fees would be\nattributable to the SBS breach of contract.      But we'll\nput those in the affidavits.\n                As it relates to Tri-Bar and our damages,\nI think -- I mean, 14.4 just doesn't have any\nexceptions to it.    It says that we get -- shall be\nentitled to payment for work executed.       And I think\nthat's an interesting and great place to make the\npoint that it doesn't say payment for work completed.\nIt says payment for work executed.      Because the idea\nbehind a termination for convenience is that it was\nterminated before it was finished.      And as Mr. Boddie\nsaid, this project was 60, 65 percent completed at\nbest.   We have costs incurred by reason of\ntermination, which we have none.      And then we have --\nalong with reasonable overhead and profit on the work\nnot executed.    So, we've proven up on the payments for\nthe work not executed, which includes Mr. Robertson's\nwork, however it's valued, was the $304,000.00 that's\nin Exhibit Number 23.     All of our numbers are right\nout of Exhibit Number 23.     The profit is defined in\nthe -- in the primary contract to be the contractor's\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

That's what that calculation\nis at the bottom.    You take the work not done yet and\nyou apply 8 percent, that's the $32,000.00 profit.\n               On the prejudgment interest, we have sued\nunder the Prompt Pay Act.     And so, prejudgment\ninterest is going to be statutory and not contractual.\nWe can worry about that post judgment if -- if the\nneed be.    As to our attorney's fees, I incurred almost\nnothing in relation to the claim involving Mr.\nRobertson and his claim.     Almost all of my fees were\nin connection with the claims raised by Tri-Bar.        And\nso, I'll be seeking the majority of my fees, which are\nabout $95,000.00, from Tri-Bar for their breach of\ncontract.\n               And I would close with -- you know,\nthere's a lot of people out there that have not been\npaid that did work on that project.        And I'll close\nwith -- from Exhibit 8 with Mr. Grable's words.         It's\nnot right in my mind to tool around with the working\nman's paycheck.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.   Thank you.

We know\nthat there were schedule problems on this project.         We\nknow from Exhibit Number 32 and lots of testimony that\nthey missed their original deadline, they missed their\nrevised deadline, and they missed their third deadline\non delivering the building.     But we also know that --\nthat Erick Key, the gentleman from Schulte, according\nto him, he was telling them, you know, I can't meet\nthis schedule.    I'm too busy.   I can't do this.    But\nthat never makes its way to us.     Instead, it's, we'll\nhave it to you in three weeks, we'll have it to you in\nfive weeks, we'll have it to you by October 15th.      But\nthat never happened.    So, apparently they weren't\ntelling us what Schulte Building Systems was telling\nthem.\n                And this pattern of -- of not being\nupfront and honest continues throughout the case.\nYou've got the situation with the brick lug, where\nthey moved the forms out to create the brick lug\nwithout telling anybody.      Now, Jack Green says that he\ntold John Grable and Victor de Anda that, but they\nboth categorically deny that fact.     Then with respect\nto the field modification issues that come up.       You\nhave the wind bents where, yeah, okay, they're moving\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But in response to that issue\nbeing raised, in Exhibit Number 55 of SBS, Steve\nSchiffman makes a firm commitment that he will not\nmake and will not allow any other field modifications\nto be made without giving notice to the owner and\ngetting approval.    But then we find out after the\nfact, they didn't just move some poles around.     They\ncut a building down so that it would fit on a\nfoundation.\n               And this -- this pattern of misleading\nTri-Bar wasn't just on the project.      It's been in this\ncase, too.    We were told that they had a\nsuperintendent on site every day and that they weren't\nallowed to work on weekends.     But then when I\ncross-examined Kyle Kieke, we found out that wasn't\ntrue.   We were told -- we've already talked about the\ntestimony about the brick lug, which is controverted\nby Mr. Grable and Mr. De Anda.      We were told that they\nwere going to show that the building was in tolerance.\nWhen Mr. Key got up here, I think we got a little\nsurprise and found out that, in fact, it was out of\ntolerance; that the tolerance was 1/16 inch per floor,\nnot the 4 inches per floor that had been represented.\n               We've been told that they didn't know --\nthat this whole idea of the -- the decision to\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

That\nMr. Grable had said in November, we're holding pay\napplications until we get the building delivered.       And\nbuilding delivered doesn't just mean the material\nthere.   It means erected.\n               THE COURT:    Does it say erected?\n               MR. SLATES:   No, it doesn't.   But I\nthink --\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:   -- I think the term\ndelivered -- the building delivered is somewhat\nambiguous.   It could mean the material only.       But I\nthink what they were looking for was --\n               THE COURT:    If I get the building\ndelivered, then I can start working on it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Yeah.   I think the idea was,\nwe want to see real progress.\n               THE COURT:    Start working on it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Yeah.

I want to talk about breaches.      And we'll\nget to the termination issue in just a minute.       But\nfirst of all, let's look at some of the other\nbreaches.    3.8 says you're supposed to have a\nsuperintendent on site at all times.        We know that\ndidn't happen.   7.8.1 says you're supposed to provide\nnotice to the owner if you're going to do business\nwith a related entity.    We know that didn't happen.\n3.10.3 says you're supposed to meet your current\nschedules.   We've seen two schedules that have been\nsupplied in this case.    They didn't meet either one of\nthem.   3.12.5 through 3.12.8 are the provisions that\nrequire them to review the shop drawings and to\nidentify discrepancies and report those to the owner.\nThey didn't do that.    3.2.2 is the section that says\nif you know of an inconsistency that exists, you need\nto submit an RFI and get guidance.     The field modified\nthe building without ever notifying the owner that\nthey were doing that.    Those are all breaches.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Let's talk about the\ntermination.   You heard Steve Schiffman say today that\nthe delay problem was ongoing.     It was something that\nwas being talked about and the owner wasn't happy and\nthey were on them, writing them to get this thing\ndone.   So, the idea that there wasn't an awareness on\nSBS's part that the owner was not happy with the way\nthe project was going in terms of the schedule is --\nreally ridiculous.\n               If you look at Tom Pittman's statements\n-- and I know you've seen them before, but I want to\nread them one more time.      At the meeting, there's no\nway to reconcile his statement with this being a\ntermination for convenience.     What he says is,\nabsolutely contractually, we don't have to pay you\nuntil this project is finished.        Mr. Clark just walked\nyou through the termination for convenience.        It says\npay now.   Pay when you terminate.\n               THE COURT:    Uh-huh.\n               MR. SLATES:    For Mr. Pittman to say\ncontractually we don't have to pay you until the\nproject is finished, that is by definition a\ntermination for cause.      What does he go on to say?   He\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

We don't feel like\nthat's a good business decision for either of us.         I\ndon't want to start posturing one way or the other.\nFinish it in a businesslike manner.     He's trying to be\na standup guy and get these guys paid, even though\nhe's got justification to terminate for cause.       And\nlet's talk about that justification.        Failure to apply\nenough properly skilled workers or materials.       They've\nhad recurring problems with that.     Steve Schiffman\nacknowledged it.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:   They try to make two\narguments to defeat the termination.        One is, you\ndidn't provide the right notice.     John Grable didn't\nsend a notice.    Tom Pittman didn't send a notice.\nThat's true.   But you've seen the provision.      It is\nnot a notice and opportunity to cure provision.       It is\na notice provision.   We're going to terminate you.\nOnce that notice goes out, there's nothing the\ncontractor can do to get the thing back out of the\nditch.\n               THE COURT:    But you can't send the notice\nuntil you get the certification from the initial\ndecision maker.    And that doesn't exist, does it?\n               MR. SLATES:   There is no written\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            378\n\n\n\n\ncertification.   You are right.      But what John Grable\nsays --\n               THE COURT:    Is that a condition?\n               MR. SLATES:   No, it's not a condition if\nyou've satisfied the requirement -- I think the reason\nthe initial decision maker is there is for a check, if\nyou will.    You want somebody else to weigh in to say,\nis it appropriate to terminate.       And they did that.\nThey talked to John Grable before they terminated.\nJohn Grable said from the stand that termination was\njustified.   And Tom Pittman said that he talked to\nGrable and that Grable did not say that it was\ninappropriate to terminate.     That in fact, he agreed\nthat it was appropriate to terminate.       With respect\nto --\n               THE COURT:    So, why does the AIA\ncontracts have this in there?        Upon certification, to\nget supposedly independent third party as initial\ndecision maker to certify that one of the four causes\nfor termination exists?\n               MR. SLATES:   As I said, I think it's --\nit's created, in my opinion, to present a check on an\nowner before they pull the trigger on a termination.\n               THE COURT:    Yeah.\n               MR. SLATES:   And my point is, they did go\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            379\n\n\n\n\nto Grable.    They did talk to Grable.      Grable was on\nboard with the termination.     Now, did he send out the\nnotice -- and that's an important point.        Mr. Clark\ninflated the certification and the notice issue.          Mr.\nGrable never said, I didn't certify that termination\nfor cause was justified.     What he said was, I didn't\nsend the notice of intent to terminate because I was\nhoping we could work it out.     Those are two different\nthings.\n               THE COURT:    Well, Grable wouldn't send a\nnotice of intent to terminate, would he?        Grable.\n               MR. SLATES:   The point is that he was\nasked to --\n               THE COURT:    Well, yes or no?\n               MR. SLATES:   -- send this notice by\nPittman.   There was an e-mail.    I don't remember the\nexhibit number.    Pittman says, hey, I want you to send\nthem a notice that we intend to terminate.       And he\nsaid, I never sent that because I was hoping we could\nwork it out.    He never said, I didn't agree that\ntermination was justified.     In fact, he specifically\nsaid that he agreed that termination was justified.\nSo, the check has been met.     The third party has said\nthe owner was right.    The owner was justified.     This\nwas appropriate.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

Certification issue in that contract?      This\nhas had to come up before.\n                MR. SLATES:   I do not, but can certainly\nlook into it.\n                THE COURT:    Well, yeah.   Give that to me\nif you can find something.\n                MR. SLATES:   Okay.\n                THE COURT:    Anybody.\n                MR. CLARK:    It's going to be an\narbitration clause and there's going to be very few on\nit, but we'll give it a shot.\n                THE COURT:    Okay.\n                MR. SLATES:   The key thing that's going\non at the time of the termination -- or the key piece\nof information that's not known at the time of\ntermination is all these defects and the magnitude of\nthe defects and the cost of repairing those defects.\nSo, you've got Tom Pittman, who is saying, look, I'm\nterminating you for cause, in so many words.        He's\nsaying, I don't have to pay you until the project is\ndone.   But I want to take care of you.      I want to get\nyou taken care of.    At that point, he doesn't know\nabout the scope of the defects.       So, he asks for an\ninvestigation to be performed.        And that investigation\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                   PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                         381\n\n\n\n\nidentifies a number of problems.\n             You heard from Mr. Boddie.     He described\nwhat the defects are.   And we know how much it cost to\nfix those defects.    You can call it -- you can call it\ndefective work.   You can call it cost to complete.    If\nyou call it defective work, our number is 317,995.74.\nIf you call it cost to complete, our number is\n650,000.\n             There's a complaint here that, you know,\nyou never sent us the list of defects.     Well, we\ndidn't have the list of defects complete in the cost\nassociated with it done -- we didn't even have the\nproject done before this lawsuit got filed.    So, yes,\nthe list of defects didn't go to them before the\nlawsuit got filed, but it did go to them in the\ncontext of this lawsuit.   So, the idea that we were\nsomehow hiding that from them is completely untrue.\n             With respect to the defects, they billed\n98.5 percent for the metal building at the time\nthey're terminated.   And yet, you saw how much work\nhad to go into getting that building finished and the\ncost associated with doing it.    So, you've got -- if\nyou do the math in the context of these numbers, the\namount that they claim that they're owed is roughly\n305, which would equate to roughly a $13,000.00 award\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L. WOLFF, C.S.R.\n                  PHONE: (830) 331-8286\n\f                                                            382\n\n\n\n\nto Tri-Bar.   If you do it this way, the balance on\ntheir contract, you'll -- the remaining balance --\nthis is a balance owed.\n               THE COURT:    I got it.\n               MR. SLATES:   The remaining balance of\nwork to be performed was 400,000.        You saw that on\nExhibit 9.    So, that would produce a $250,000.00\nnumber.   And Mr. Cluck pointed you to the language\nthat says that the architect has to certify the\npayment after the termination.       That goes both ways.\nWhat that provision says is, if money is owed to them,\nthe architect has to certify that money is owed to\nthem.   Neither one of us have introduced evidence that\nthe architect says, you're owed this much money or the\narchitect says you're owed that much money.       So,\nthat's a wash.    With respect to Robertson -- unless\nyou have any other questions on the SBS aspect of\nthis.\n               THE COURT:    No.   I got it.\n               MR. SLATES:   Okay.    With respect to\nRobertson, there is no evidence of a contract.       I\nthink you've already touched upon that with Mr. Brown,\nand so I won't spend any time on it.        Other than just\nto say, you asked me a question the other day about\noral contracts.\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

SLATES:    The evidence in this case is\nuncontroverted that Mr. Robertson and Mr. Pittman\nnever spoke to one another.     In fact, that's one of\nthe things that he complains about.      So, there can't\nbe an oral contract.     With respect to tortious\ninterference --\n               THE COURT:    Any e-mails between them\nabout a contract?\n               MR. SLATES:    None whatsoever.\n               THE COURT:    No communication?\n               MR. SLATES:    No communications at all.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.\n               MR. SLATES:    There's not a written\ncommunication.    There's not an oral communication.      In\nfact, that's one of the things, as I said, that they\ncomplained about.    Turning to the tortious\ninterference issue -- again, we believe the law is\nthat there are three grounds on which to avoid\ntortious interference.      One is, we had the legal right\nto require SBS to make a change, and we believe we've\nestablished that based upon the incorporation of the\nA201 general conditions into their subcontract, and\nthe fact that the A201 allows for a termination for\nconvenience.   You may agree or disagree with me on\n\n\n\n                     TAMI L.

SLATES:    I don't know how you can\npossibly disagree on the next two points.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. SLATES:    The second one is that the\nperson who undertook the conduct had a good faith\nbelief that they had their right to do that.       And Tom\nPittman told you that.     He told you that he believed\nthat he had the right.     He told you that it was his\ngood faith belief that he had the right.      That he had\nno malice towards Robertson.    He's sitting there --\n              THE COURT:    He told him he's going to\ndestroy anybody in his way.\n              MR. SLATES:    No -- no, sir.   He never --\n              THE COURT:    Crush.    Excuse me.\n              MR. SLATES:    He said that about Steve\nSchiffman.   He never said anything like that about Mr.\nRobertson.\n              THE COURT:    Okay.\n              MR. SLATES:    And with respect to the good\nfaith belief, he's sitting there with a bid for 60,000\nand then 56,000 and then one for 21,000.      That's\nbefore he's gotten the 32.\n              THE COURT:    Uh-huh.\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

SLATES:     Mr. Robertson's own words:\nWhichever one gives us the best deal is the one we go\nwith.   He believed he had the right to go with the\nlower bid.   He believed he had the right to tell SBS\nto make a change so that he could go with the lower\nbid.    He had a good faith belief that he had the right\nto --\n               THE COURT:    That's what any good\nbusinessman should do; right?\n               MR. SLATES:     You go out of business real\nfast if you go with the high bidder every time.\n               THE COURT:    Unless you sign a contract.\n               MR. SLATES:     No.   I think if you're in\nthe construction business and you go with the high\nbidder every time, things are going to go bad for you\nreal fast.   But let me just get to the last point.\nAnd I want to quote Mr. Brown on this.\n               THE COURT:    Uh-oh.\n               MR. SLATES:     He says, if you say you can\nfly, you've got to prove you can.        Our last point is\nthat we have a superior interest.\n               THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n               MR. SLATES:     And the owner has a superior\ninterest.    I can say that.    The owner owns the\nproperty.    The owner occupies the property.     The owner\n\n\n\n                    TAMI L.

But you don't have to take my\nword for it.   You can take Mr. Robertson's word for\nit.   Because I asked him those same questions from the\nstand and he said yes to every one.      So, I'm flying\nright now because I have proven that the owner has a\nsuperior interest through Mr. Robertson's testimony.\n               THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n               MR. SLATES:    That's all I have, Your\nHonor.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.   Thank you.   Anything\nelse from anybody?\n               MR. BROWN:    Just briefly.   With regard to\nthe attorney's fees issue, I do agree that the\nmajority of my fees are -- and will be in my affidavit\n-- where incurred against Tri-Bar.       And with regard to\nthe damage issue, I would simply say -- I think it's\n9.031 of -- of the SBS/Robertson contract.\n               THE COURT:    What exhibit is that, please?\n               MR. BROWN:    That would be Exhibit 1.     And\nwe believe it will address it.       It does start off that\nin the event of any damages, but there is a provision\nin there dealing with the fact that -- that if --\nwhere in the event the subcontractor is liable, then\nthe contractor entitles himself to projected overhead,\ncorporate office, overhead profit, et cetera,\n\n\n\n                   TAMI L.

And that section would have to be\nreflective.    I mean, it would just have to be.     It's\nin the contract, so if it applies one way, it applies\nthe other.\n               THE COURT:    Okay.
