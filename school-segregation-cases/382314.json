INTRODUCTION\n\f       Appellant, Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare\n\nFund (“Central States”), an employee welfare benefit plan, paid medical expenses on\n\nbehalf of individuals pursuant to agreements subject to the Employment Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Central States claimed that appellee insurance\n\ncompanies were primarily responsible for paying certain expenses it had paid and it sued\n\nthe appellees and their policy administrator to recover these expenditures in the amount\n\nof $194,212.25. The District Court dismissed a complaint that Central States and its\n\ntrustee brought under ERISA § 502(a)(3), which authorizes ERISA plan administrators\n\nonly to bring claims for equitable relief, not for money damages. Central States appeals\n\nfrom that ruling, and we will affirm.\n\n\n\n                                II. BACKGROUND\n\n       Central States provides welfare benefits to Teamsters and their dependents under\n\nan ERISA-governed plan.1 This suit concerns medical expenses of 19 individuals, all\n\ndependents of participants in Central States’ plan (the “dependents”), who sustained\n\ninjuries in accidents occurring at various facilities, including secondary schools, colleges,\n\nsports camps, and churches. Appellees, Monumental Life Insurance Company and\n\nMarkel Insurance Company, issued policies to the entities responsible for the facilities\n\n\n\n1\n  We draw the facts from Central States’ complaint and the provisions of its benefits plan,\nwhich it attached as an exhibit to its complaint. See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v.\nWhite Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that on a motion\nto dismiss courts generally can consider “only the allegations contained in the complaint,\nexhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record”).\n                                              2\n\finsuring against medical claims arising from accidental injuries at those locations.\n\nAppellee, Bollinger, Inc., administered the policies.\n\n       Central States characterizes the insurance that appellees wrote as “overlapping”\n\ncoverage, which is subject to the coordination of benefits (COB) provision included in\n\nCentral States’ plan. Appellants’ br. at 14. According to Central States’ COB provision,\n\ninsurers who provide overlapping coverage are primary insurers—and consequently must\n\nbear the costs of treatment of the Central States’ plan’s dependents having claims within\n\nthe scope of the insurers’ policies—if the insurer does not have a COB provision in its\n\npolicy, if it writes specific risk coverage, such as coverage for premises liability, or if it\n\nprovides benefits directly to the insured, as distinguished from a dependent. Central\n\nStates’ plan also authorizes it to seek recovery of benefits it mistakenly paid that should\n\nhave been paid by another entity.\n\n       According to Central States’ COB provisions, appellees were the dependents’\n\nprimary insurers for the medical expenses involved here, so Central States sought\n\nreimbursement for the expenditures it had made on the dependents’ behalf. Appellees\n\nrefused to pay, contending instead that they issued “excess policies,” which are “designed\n\nto supplement any other insurance or plan.” J.A. 104. Appellees argued that these\n\npolicies provide coverage only if Central States first “contribute[s] its maximum plan\n\nbenefits.” Id.\n\n       On April 30, 2013, Central States filed the complaint in this case in the District\n\nCourt seeking reimbursement from appellees for the medical expenses it had paid on the\n\ndependents’ behalf. Specifically, Central States requested (1) a declaratory judgment\n\n                                               3\n\frequiring appellees to pay unpaid present and future covered medical expenses; (2) a\n\ndeclaratory judgment requiring appellees to pay covered medical expenses that Central\n\nStates already had incurred and a finding that Central States is a secondary, not primary,\n\ninsurer; (3) restitution for the payments Central States had made; and (4) an equitable lien\n\nor constructive trust on appellees’ assets to the extent that Central States paid the medical\n\nexpenses as it contended that appellees had been unjustly enriched to the extent of those\n\npayments. Appellees moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground\n\nthat § 502(a)(3) did not authorize the action. The District Court granted the motion on\n\nAugust 22, 2013. Central States, Se. and Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Bollinger,\n\nInc., No. 13-2760, 2013 WL 4502083 (D.N.J. Aug. 22, 2013). Central States timely\n\nappealed from the order of dismissal.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Central States has filed substantially identical claims against different insurers in three\nother jurisdictions. In two cases, filed in New York and Texas, the district courts\ndismissed Central States’ complaints on the ground that § 503(a)(3) barred the complaint.\nSee Central States, Se. & Sw. Area Health & Welfare Fund v. Gerber Life Ins. Co., 984\nF. Supp. 2d 246, (S.D.N.Y. 2013); Central States, Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare\nFund ex rel. McDougall v. Health Special Risk, Inc., No. 11-CV-2910, 2012 WL\n5006054 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2012), aff’d, No. 13-10705, __ F.3d __, 2014 WL 2853587\n(5th Cir. June 23, 2014). Although Central States’ complaint in the third case which it\nfiled in Michigan was identical to the others it filed, the Michigan court ruled in its favor\non the merits without considering the effect of § 502(a)(3). Central States, Se. & Sw.\nAreas Health & Welfare Fund v. First Agency, Inc., 848 F. Supp. 2d 805 (W.D. Mich.\n2012). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to\nthe extent it held that the defendant was primarily responsible for paying the disputed\nclaims, but reversed the court’s monetary award and ruled that the relief sought by\nCentral States was not equitable, and thus was not available under § 502(a)(3). Central\nStates, Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. First Agency, Inc., __ F.3d __, 2014\nWL 2933225 (6th Cir. July 1, 2014).\n\n                                              4\n\f               III. JURISDICTION and STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132(e)(1),3 and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We apply plenary\n\nreview on appeal from dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6). Renfro v. Unisys Corp., 671 F.3d\n\n314, 320 (3d Cir. 2011). We must “accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the\n\ncomplaint, and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.” Santomenno ex\n\nrel. John Hancock Trust v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.), 677 F.3d 178, 182 (3d\n\nCir. 2012).\n\n\n\n                                 IV. DISCUSSION\n\n       ERISA provides a “carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.” Mertens\n\nv. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 254, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 2067 (1993). The case centers on\n\nERISA § 502(a)(3), which authorizes an ERISA participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\n\n“(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the\n\nterms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such\n\nviolations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.” 29\n\n\n\n\n3\n We note that in Sackman v. Teaneck Nursing Center, 86 F. App’x 483 (3d Cir. 2003),\nwhich we discuss below, we held that a district court did not have jurisdiction over an\nunjust enrichment claim brought under § 503(a)(3). We think, however, that the District\nCourt in this case had jurisdiction but that Central States’ claim fails on the merits. See\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Price, 501 F.3d 271, 276-77 (3d Cir. 2007) (noting that a\nsubstantial, non-frivolous claim for relief under section 502(a)(3) is enough to confer\nsubject matter jurisdiction). For our purposes the distinction is not material as under both\napproaches the case would be dismissed.\n                                              5\n\fU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). The Supreme Court has read two important limitations into the\n\nscope of ERISA’s remedial scheme.\n\n       First, given the detailed enforcement mechanisms within the statute, the Court has\n\nstated that “Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to\n\nincorporate expressly.’” Mertens, 508 U.S. at 254, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (quoting\n\nMassachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 146, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3092\n\n(1985)). The available remedies for an alleged injury by reason of the matters listed in\n\n§ 502(a)(3) thus are limited to those provided in the statute.4\n\n       Second, and most relevant to this appeal, the Supreme Court has defined “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” to mean only “‘those categories of relief that were typically\n\navailable in equity.’” Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204,\n\n210, 122 S.Ct. 708, 712 (2002) (quoting Mertens, 508 U.S. at 256, 113 S.Ct. at 2069).\n\nThus, to distinguish between equitable relief (which is available under § 502(a)(3)) and\n\nlegal relief (which is not available) courts must determine whether the relief “would have\n\nbeen equitable ‘in the days of the divided bench.’” Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med. Servs.,\n\nInc., 547 U.S. 356, 362, 126 S.Ct. 1869, 1874 (2006) (quoting Great-West, 534 U.S. at\n\n212, 122 S.Ct. at 714)). “‘Almost invariably . . . suits seeking (whether by judgment,\n\ninjunction, or declaration) to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff\n\nare suits for money damages’” and may not be brought under § 502(a)(3). Great-West,\n\n534 U.S. at 210, 122 S.Ct. at 713 (quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 918-\n\n4\n  In light of this clear directive from the statute and the Supreme Court, we reject an\ninvitation that Central States has extended to us to go beyond the statute and create a\nremedy using federal common law.\n                                              6\n\f19, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 2745 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Although this limitation on ERISA actions sometimes may preclude petitioners\n\nfrom bringing valid claims, the Court determined that this outcome was a necessary\n\nconsequence of Congress’s resolution of the “tension” between ERISA’s competing goals\n\nof benefitting employees and containing pension costs. Mertens, 508 U.S. at 262-63, 113\n\nS.Ct. at 2071-72.\n\n       Whether a claim is legal or equitable depends on both (1) the nature of the\n\nrecovery sought and (2) the basis for the plaintiff’s claim. See Great-West, 534 U.S. at\n\n213, 122 S.Ct. at 714; see also Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 363, 126 S.Ct. at 1874. Although\n\nCentral States attempts to portray its claim as equitable, we agree with the District Court\n\nthat it is legal and thus is not actionable under § 502(a)(3).\n\n              A. Nature of Relief Sought\n\n       Regardless of how a plaintiff labels the relief it seeks in a complaint, a suit seeking\n\na result that a defendant is liable to pay money to the plaintiff may not be brought under\n\n§ 502(a)(3) unless the plaintiff is seeking to recover particular, traceable funds in the\n\ndefendant’s possession. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362-63, 126 S.Ct. at 1874. The Court\n\nexplained this restriction in Great-West, in which an ERISA-regulated plan paid a\n\nbeneficiary’s medical expenses after she was involved in a car accident. Great-West, 534\n\nU.S. at 207, 122 S.Ct. at 711. The beneficiary settled a tort suit against the car’s\n\nmanufacturer, but the proceeds of the settlement were not paid directly to her—instead,\n\nthe funds were deposited into a trust account set up on her behalf. Id. at 208, 122 S.Ct. at\n\n711. Great-West sued various potentially liable parties under § 502(a)(3) to recover the\n\n                                               7\n\ffull value of the medical expenses it had paid, arguing that its claim was equitable as it\n\nsought injunctive and specific performance relief compelling the performance of a\n\ncontract, id. at 210, 122 S.Ct. at 713, and restitution, id. at 212, 122 S.Ct. at 714.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected both formulations of the relief Great-West sought. It\n\nfound the request for an injunction to compel the payment of money to be nothing more\n\nthan a request for money damages, which was “not typically available in equity.” Great-\n\nWest, 534 U.S. at 210, 122 S.Ct. at 713; see also id. at 211 n.1, 122 S.Ct. at 713 n.1\n\n(noting that “any claim for legal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, be phrased in\n\nterms of an injunction”). In considering the restitution claim, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween claims for repayment “in which the plaintiff could not assert title or right to\n\npossession of a particular property,” and claims where the plaintiff sought money or\n\nproperty that “could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant’s\n\npossession.” Id. at 213, 122 S.Ct. at 714 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only in the\n\nlatter circumstance was there a situation in which a claimant of the funds could assert a\n\nclaim for restitution in equity. Id. “Thus, for restitution to lie in equity, the action\n\ngenerally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant, but to restore to the\n\nplaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant’s possession.” Id. at 214, 122 S.Ct.\n\nat 714-15 (emphasis added). As the settlement proceeds—the basis for Great-West’s\n\nclaim—were not in the beneficiary’s possession, relief was not available under\n\n§ 502(a)(3).\n\n       However, an insurer may sue under § 502(a)(3) to recover settlement proceeds that\n\nare in a plan beneficiary’s possession and control. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362-63, 126\n\n                                               8\n\fS.Ct. at 1874-75. The material facts in Sereboff were not distinguishable from those in\n\nGreat-West, except that the plan’s beneficiaries in Sereboff retained the settlement\n\nproceeds which thus were not placed into a trust as had been done in Great-West. Id. at\n\n360, 126 S.Ct. at 1872. Distinguishing Great-West, the Court held that the plaintiff\n\nsought a restitution remedy in Sereboff that was equitable, not legal, because the insurer\n\n“sought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the\n\nSereboffs.” Id. at 362-63, 126 S.Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Central States attempts to cast the relief it seeks as equitable, using terms such as\n\nrestitution, equitable lien, constructive trust, and declaratory judgment.5 Nevertheless\n\nnone of its arguments convince us that it is seeking relief that differs from the relief that a\n\nsuccessful plaintiff can obtain in an action to impose personal liability on a defendant for\n\nmoney damages. See, e.g., J.A. 105-06 (requesting declaration that appellees were\n\n5\n  Central States argues that its requests for declaratory judgments are not requests for\nmoney damages, but rather for declarations “that its Plan’s COB rules are enforceable\nagainst the” appellees. Appellants’ br. at 45. We think it clear, however, that such\nrequests simply seek a recovery equal to the sum of money that Central States had paid\nthough it does so by using equitable nomenclature. Cf. Christ the King Manor, Inc. v.\nSec’y U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 730 F.3d 291, 319 (3d Cir. 2013) (noting, in\nEleventh Amendment context, that “we must ‘look to the substance rather than the form\nof the relief requested’” (quoting Blanciak v. Allegheny Ludlum Corp., 77 F.3d 690, 698\n(3d Cir. 1996)). We also point out that we have not overlooked appellees’ contention that\neven if the requests for a declaration were permissible under § 502(a)(3) (which they are\nnot), such prospective relief would not come within the constitutional doctrine requiring\nus to adjudicate only actual “Cases” or “Controversies.” See U.S. Const. art. III § 2.\nHypothetical, speculative, or future conflicts are not enough to satisfy Article III. See\nLos Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1666-67 (1983); see also\nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 126-30, 127 S.Ct. 764, 772-75\n(2007) (indicating “case or actual controversy” requirement in the Declaratory Judgment\nAct is coextensive with Article III). We, however, do not rest our decision on appellees’\nconstitutional argument as we are deciding the case on statutory grounds.\n\n                                               9\n\frequired “to pay unpaid present and future covered medical expenses”); J.A. 107\n\n(requesting, under heading “declaratory judgment,” “an injunction requiring the\n\n[appellees] to pay covered medical expenses . . . and to fully reimburse Central States”\n\nfor payments already made); J.A. 109-110 (requesting restitution of payments made);\n\nJ.A. 110-11 (requesting “equitable lien upon sums constructively held by the\n\n[appellees]”). Indeed, Central States’ complaint and briefs strike us as precisely the type\n\nof “lawyerly inventiveness” about which the Supreme Court cautioned in Great-West and\n\nwhich we consistently have rejected. See, e.g., Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 484 F.3d 644,\n\n655 (3d Cir. 2007) (finding claim “for compensatory damages merely framed as an\n\n‘equitable’ injunction” not actionable under § 502(a)(3)); Providence Health Plan v.\n\nMcDowell, 385 F.3d 1168, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004) (rejecting purported legal remedy\n\ndespite plaintiff’s “attempt to disguise its claim in equitable clothes”).\n\n       We rejected a claim almost identical to that which Central States makes here in a\n\nnot precedential opinion, Sackman v. Teaneck Nursing Center, 86 F. App’x 483, 485 (3d\n\nCir. 2003). The plaintiffs, trustees of a health and benefit fund, had paid the defendant’s\n\nemployees’ medical claims which it argued that the defendant should have paid. We held\n\nthat the complaint must be dismissed because there was no “specific block of money”\n\nthat had passed from the plaintiffs to the defendant. Consequently, the plaintiffs’\n\nrestitution claim sought a legal remedy and thus was unavailable under § 502(a)(3). Id.\n\nLikewise, Central States wants appellees to reimburse it for expenses for which it alleges\n\nthey are responsible but does not seek that they be compelled to return a “specific block\n\nof money” that appellees received improperly. Accordingly, regardless of how many\n\n                                              10\n\fdifferent labels Central States applies to its claims, fundamentally it is seeking an order\n\ncompelling appellees to pay it a sum of money that is not segregated from appellees’\n\nother assets. Such an attempt does not seek equitable relief.\n\n              B. Basis of the Claim\n\n       Section 502(a)(3) also bars Central States’ claim because the basis for the claim is\n\nnot equitable. In Sereboff, after determining that the insurer sought equitable relief, the\n\nCourt moved to a second inquiry, asking whether it could establish that “the basis for its\n\nclaim is equitable.” 547 U.S. at 363, 126 S.Ct. at 1874. The Court answered in the\n\naffirmative, finding that the insurer’s claim was to enforce an “equitable lien by\n\nagreement” based on a plan provision requiring beneficiaries to turn over any funds\n\nreceived from a third party. Id. at 364-65, 126 S.Ct. at 1875-76. The Court relied on an\n\nearlier case, Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U.S. 117, 34 S.Ct. 276 (1914), in which lawyers by\n\ncontract were promised one-third of a contingent fee in exchange for legal work on a\n\nparticular case. When the contingent fee was paid, the lawyers became entitled to an\n\nequitable lien by agreement on a portion of the recovered fee equal to the portion to\n\nwhich their agreement entitled them even though the subject of the lien did not exist\n\nwhen the parties executed the contract for their services. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365-\n\n66, 126 S.Ct. at 1875-76. Sereboff held, applying Barnes’ teaching, that although the\n\nfund over which the insurer asserted a lien did not exist when the plan was executed, its\n\nclaim was nonetheless equitable under the “familiar rule of equity that a contract to\n\nconvey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fsoon as he gets a title to the thing.” Id. at 367, 126 S.Ct. at 1877 (quoting Barnes, 232\n\nU.S. at 121, 34 S.Ct. at 278) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\n       Central States contends that this language, along with other Supreme Court\n\ndecisions interpreting § 502(a)(3), qualify its claim as an equitable lien by agreement,\n\nthus permitting it to recover from appellees the funds it expended on the dependents.\n\nCentral States is mistaken. The key to the equitable liens by agreement that the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized in Barnes and Sereboff was an agreement between the parties: the\n\nlawyers suing in Barnes had an agreement to recover fees, 232 U.S. at 119, 34 S.Ct. at\n\n277, and the plaintiffs in Sereboff expressly agreed in their insurance policy to reimburse\n\ntheir insurer for benefits the insurer paid if the plaintiffs recovered money by reason of\n\nthe accident from a third party, Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 359, 126 S.Ct. at 1872. Here, by\n\ncontrast, Central States does not claim that it had any agreement with appellees with\n\nrespect to the expenditures at issue in this case. We have explained that an equitable lien\n\nby agreement is “a lien arising out of an agreement to convey ownership of specific\n\nproperty to one party as soon as the counterparty gets title to the property.” Funk v.\n\nCIGNA Grp. Ins., 648 F.3d 182, 194 (3d Cir. 2011) (emphasis added) (citing Sereboff,\n\n547 U.S. at 363-65, 126 S.Ct. at 1874-76); see also US Airways v. McCutchen, 133 S.Ct.\n\n1537, 1545 (2013) (affirming Sereboff’s holding that insurer can bring action to enforce a\n\ncontract-based lien under § 502(a)(3)). Absent a contract or other enforceable agreement\n\nunderlying the claim asserted, and there is none here, we cannot impose an equitable lien.\n\n       Central States ultimately makes a policy argument: it complains that, without a\n\nremedy under § 502(a)(3), appellees and other similarly situated insurers can avoid\n\n                                             12\n\fliability for claims on which they are obligated simply by letting Central States and other\n\nERISA plans foot the bill in the first instance, and then refusing to reimburse them. But\n\nthey assert the policy argument to no avail because “‘whatever merits policy arguments\n\nmay have, it is not the province of courts to rewrite the statute to accommodate them.’”\n\nSweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 518 (3d Cir. 2002) (alterations omitted) (quoting Artuz\n\nv. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 10, 121 S.Ct. 361, 365 (2000)); see also Mertens, 508 U.S. at 261,\n\n113 S.Ct. at 2071 (“[V]ague notions of a statute’s ‘basic purpose’ are nonetheless\n\ninadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under\n\nconsideration.”). Central States’ claims do not fall within the limited authority provided\n\nby § 502(a)(3). This circumstance—dictated by the plain language of ERISA and\n\nSupreme Court jurisprudence—ends our inquiry.\n\n\n\n                                   V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For these reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court of August 22,\n\n2013, dismissing the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\f       Appellant, Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare\n\nFund (“Central States”), an employee welfare benefit plan, paid medical expenses on\n\nbehalf of individuals pursuant to agreements subject to the Employment Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Central States claimed that appellee insurance\n\ncompanies were primarily responsible for paying certain expenses it had paid and it sued\n\nthe appellees and their policy administrator to recover these expenditures in the amount\n\nof $194,212.25. The District Court dismissed a complaint that Central States and its\n\ntrustee brought under ERISA § 502(a)(3), which authorizes ERISA plan administrators\n\nonly to bring claims for equitable relief, not for money damages. Central States appeals\n\nfrom that ruling, and we will affirm.\n\n\n\n                                II. BACKGROUND\n\n       Central States provides welfare benefits to Teamsters and their dependents under\n\nan ERISA-governed plan.1 This suit concerns medical expenses of 19 individuals, all\n\ndependents of participants in Central States’ plan (the “dependents”), who sustained\n\ninjuries in accidents occurring at various facilities, including secondary schools, colleges,\n\nsports camps, and churches. Appellees, Monumental Life Insurance Company and\n\nMarkel Insurance Company, issued policies to the entities responsible for the facilities\n\n\n\n1\n  We draw the facts from Central States’ complaint and the provisions of its benefits plan,\nwhich it attached as an exhibit to its complaint.

Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611569\"><a href=\"/opinion/611569/pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation-v-white-consolidated-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that on a motion\nto dismiss courts generally can consider “only the allegations contained in the complaint,\nexhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record”).\n                                              2\n\finsuring against medical claims arising from accidental injuries at those locations.\n\nAppellee, Bollinger, Inc., administered the policies.\n\n       Central States characterizes the insurance that appellees wrote as “overlapping”\n\ncoverage, which is subject to the coordination of benefits (COB) provision included in\n\nCentral States’ plan. Appellants’ br. at 14. According to Central States’ COB provision,\n\ninsurers who provide overlapping coverage are primary insurers—and consequently must\n\nbear the costs of treatment of the Central States’ plan’s dependents having claims within\n\nthe scope of the insurers’ policies—if the insurer does not have a COB provision in its\n\npolicy, if it writes specific risk coverage, such as coverage for premises liability, or if it\n\nprovides benefits directly to the insured, as distinguished from a dependent. Central\n\nStates’ plan also authorizes it to seek recovery of benefits it mistakenly paid that should\n\nhave been paid by another entity.\n\n       According to Central States’ COB provisions, appellees were the dependents’\n\nprimary insurers for the medical expenses involved here, so Central States sought\n\nreimbursement for the expenditures it had made on the dependents’ behalf. Appellees\n\nrefused to pay, contending instead that they issued “excess policies,” which are “designed\n\nto supplement any other insurance or plan.” J.A. 104. Appellees argued that these\n\npolicies provide coverage only if Central States first “contribute[s] its maximum plan\n\nbenefits.” Id.\n\n       On April 30, 2013, Central States filed the complaint in this case in the District\n\nCourt seeking reimbursement from appellees for the medical expenses it had paid on the\n\ndependents’ behalf. Specifically, Central States requested (1) a declaratory judgment\n\n                                               3\n\frequiring appellees to pay unpaid present and future covered medical expenses; (2) a\n\ndeclaratory judgment requiring appellees to pay covered medical expenses that Central\n\nStates already had incurred and a finding that Central States is a secondary, not primary,\n\ninsurer; (3) restitution for the payments Central States had made; and (4) an equitable lien\n\nor constructive trust on appellees’ assets to the extent that Central States paid the medical\n\nexpenses as it contended that appellees had been unjustly enriched to the extent of those\n\npayments. Appellees moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground\n\nthat § 502(a)(3) did not authorize the action. The District Court granted the motion on\n\nAugust 22, 2013.

The case centers on\n\nERISA § 502(a)(3), which authorizes an ERISA participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\n\n“(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the\n\nterms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such\n\nviolations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.” 29\n\n\n\n\n3\n We note that in Sackman v. Teaneck Nursing Center, 86 F. App’x 483 (3d Cir. 2003),\nwhich we discuss below, we held that a district court did not have jurisdiction over an\nunjust enrichment claim brought under § 503(a)(3). We think, however, that the District\nCourt in this case had jurisdiction but that Central States’ claim fails on the merits. See\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

The Supreme Court has read two important limitations into the\n\nscope of ERISA’s remedial scheme.\n\n       First, given the detailed enforcement mechanisms within the statute, the Court has\n\nstated that “Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to\n\nincorporate expressly.’” Mertens, 508 U.S. at 254, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (quoting\n\nMassachusetts Mut.

The available remedies for an alleged injury by reason of the matters listed in\n\n§ 502(a)(3) thus are limited to those provided in the statute.4\n\n       Second, and most relevant to this appeal, the Supreme Court has defined “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” to mean only “‘those categories of relief that were typically\n\navailable in equity.’” Great-West Life & Annuity Ins.

Nature of Relief Sought\n\n       Regardless of how a plaintiff labels the relief it seeks in a complaint, a suit seeking\n\na result that a defendant is liable to pay money to the plaintiff may not be brought under\n\n§ 502(a)(3) unless the plaintiff is seeking to recover particular, traceable funds in the\n\ndefendant’s possession. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362-63, 126 S.Ct. at 1874. The Court\n\nexplained this restriction in Great-West, in which an ERISA-regulated plan paid a\n\nbeneficiary’s medical expenses after she was involved in a car accident. Great-West, 534\n\nU.S. at 207, 122 S.Ct. at 711. The beneficiary settled a tort suit against the car’s\n\nmanufacturer, but the proceeds of the settlement were not paid directly to her—instead,\n\nthe funds were deposited into a trust account set up on her behalf. Id. at 208, 122 S.Ct. at\n\n711. Great-West sued various potentially liable parties under § 502(a)(3) to recover the\n\n                                               7\n\ffull value of the medical expenses it had paid, arguing that its claim was equitable as it\n\nsought injunctive and specific performance relief compelling the performance of a\n\ncontract, id. at 210, 122 S.Ct. at 713, and restitution, id. at 212, 122 S.Ct. at 714.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected both formulations of the relief Great-West sought. It\n\nfound the request for an injunction to compel the payment of money to be nothing more\n\nthan a request for money damages, which was “not typically available in equity.” Great-\n\nWest, 534 U.S. at 210, 122 S.Ct. at 713; see also id. at 211 n.1, 122 S.Ct. at 713 n.1\n\n(noting that “any claim for legal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, be phrased in\n\nterms of an injunction”). In considering the restitution claim, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween claims for repayment “in which the plaintiff could not assert title or right to\n\npossession of a particular property,” and claims where the plaintiff sought money or\n\nproperty that “could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant’s\n\npossession.” Id. at 213, 122 S.Ct. at 714 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only in the\n\nlatter circumstance was there a situation in which a claimant of the funds could assert a\n\nclaim for restitution in equity. Id. “Thus, for restitution to lie in equity, the action\n\ngenerally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant, but to restore to the\n\nplaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant’s possession.” Id. at 214, 122 S.Ct.\n\nat 714-15 (emphasis added). As the settlement proceeds—the basis for Great-West’s\n\nclaim—were not in the beneficiary’s possession, relief was not available under\n\n§ 502(a)(3).\n\n       However, an insurer may sue under § 502(a)(3) to recover settlement proceeds that\n\nare in a plan beneficiary’s possession and control. Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 362-63, 126\n\n                                               8\n\fS.Ct. at 1874-75. The material facts in Sereboff were not distinguishable from those in\n\nGreat-West, except that the plan’s beneficiaries in Sereboff retained the settlement\n\nproceeds which thus were not placed into a trust as had been done in Great-West. Id. at\n\n360, 126 S.Ct. at 1872. Distinguishing Great-West, the Court held that the plaintiff\n\nsought a restitution remedy in Sereboff that was equitable, not legal, because the insurer\n\n“sought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the\n\nSereboffs.” Id. at 362-63, 126 S.Ct. at 1874 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Central States attempts to cast the relief it seeks as equitable, using terms such as\n\nrestitution, equitable lien, constructive trust, and declaratory judgment.5 Nevertheless\n\nnone of its arguments convince us that it is seeking relief that differs from the relief that a\n\nsuccessful plaintiff can obtain in an action to impose personal liability on a defendant for\n\nmoney damages. See, e.g., J.A. 105-06 (requesting declaration that appellees were\n\n5\n  Central States argues that its requests for declaratory judgments are not requests for\nmoney damages, but rather for declarations “that its Plan’s COB rules are enforceable\nagainst the” appellees. Appellants’ br. at 45. We think it clear, however, that such\nrequests simply seek a recovery equal to the sum of money that Central States had paid\nthough it does so by using equitable nomenclature. Cf.

Indeed, Central States’ complaint and briefs strike us as precisely the type\n\nof “lawyerly inventiveness” about which the Supreme Court cautioned in Great-West and\n\nwhich we consistently have rejected. See, e.g., Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797565\"><a href=\"/opinion/797565/kurt-h-eichorn-william-j-huckins-t-roger-kiang-edward-w-landis-orlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n655 (3d Cir. 2007) (finding claim “for compensatory damages merely framed as an\n\n‘equitable’ injunction” not actionable under § 502(a)(3)); Providence Health Plan v.\n\nMcDowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788027\"><a href=\"/opinion/788027/providence-health-plan-an-oregon-non-profit-corporation-v-gary-mcdowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004) (rejecting purported legal remedy\n\ndespite plaintiff’s “attempt to disguise its claim in equitable clothes”).\n\n       We rejected a claim almost identical to that which Central States makes here in a\n\nnot precedential opinion, Sackman v. Teaneck Nursing Center, 86 F. App’x 483, 485 (3d\n\nCir. 2003). The plaintiffs, trustees of a health and benefit fund, had paid the defendant’s\n\nemployees’ medical claims which it argued that the defendant should have paid. We held\n\nthat the complaint must be dismissed because there was no “specific block of money”\n\nthat had passed from the plaintiffs to the defendant. Consequently, the plaintiffs’\n\nrestitution claim sought a legal remedy and thus was unavailable under § 502(a)(3). Id.\n\nLikewise, Central States wants appellees to reimburse it for expenses for which it alleges\n\nthey are responsible but does not seek that they be compelled to return a “specific block\n\nof money” that appellees received improperly. Accordingly, regardless of how many\n\n                                              10\n\fdifferent labels Central States applies to its claims, fundamentally it is seeking an order\n\ncompelling appellees to pay it a sum of money that is not segregated from appellees’\n\nother assets. Such an attempt does not seek equitable relief.\n\n              B. Basis of the Claim\n\n       Section 502(a)(3) also bars Central States’ claim because the basis for the claim is\n\nnot equitable. In Sereboff, after determining that the insurer sought equitable relief, the\n\nCourt moved to a second inquiry, asking whether it could establish that “the basis for its\n\nclaim is equitable.” 547 U.S. at 363, 126 S.Ct. at 1874. The Court answered in the\n\naffirmative, finding that the insurer’s claim was to enforce an “equitable lien by\n\nagreement” based on a plan provision requiring beneficiaries to turn over any funds\n\nreceived from a third party. Id. at 364-65, 126 S.Ct. at 1875-76. The Court relied on an\n\nearlier case, Barnes v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98064\"><a href=\"/opinion/98064/barnes-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1914), in which lawyers by\n\ncontract were promised one-third of a contingent fee in exchange for legal work on a\n\nparticular case. When the contingent fee was paid, the lawyers became entitled to an\n\nequitable lien by agreement on a portion of the recovered fee equal to the portion to\n\nwhich their agreement entitled them even though the subject of the lien did not exist\n\nwhen the parties executed the contract for their services. See Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 365-\n\n66, 126 S.Ct. at 1875-76. Sereboff held, applying Barnes’ teaching, that although the\n\nfund over which the insurer asserted a lien did not exist when the plan was executed, its\n\nclaim was nonetheless equitable under the “familiar rule of equity that a contract to\n\nconvey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fsoon as he gets a title to the thing.” Id. at 367, 126 S.Ct. at 1877 (quoting Barnes, 232\n\nU.S. at 121, 34 S.Ct. at 278) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\n       Central States contends that this language, along with other Supreme Court\n\ndecisions interpreting § 502(a)(3), qualify its claim as an equitable lien by agreement,\n\nthus permitting it to recover from appellees the funds it expended on the dependents.\n\nCentral States is mistaken. The key to the equitable liens by agreement that the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized in Barnes and Sereboff was an agreement between the parties: the\n\nlawyers suing in Barnes had an agreement to recover fees, 232 U.S. at 119, 34 S.Ct. at\n\n277, and the plaintiffs in Sereboff expressly agreed in their insurance policy to reimburse\n\ntheir insurer for benefits the insurer paid if the plaintiffs recovered money by reason of\n\nthe accident from a third party, Sereboff, 547 U.S. at 359, 126 S.Ct. at 1872. Here, by\n\ncontrast, Central States does not claim that it had any agreement with appellees with\n\nrespect to the expenditures at issue in this case. We have explained that an equitable lien\n\nby agreement is “a lien arising out of an agreement to convey ownership of specific\n\nproperty to one party as soon as the counterparty gets title to the property.” Funk v.\n\nCIGNA Grp.
