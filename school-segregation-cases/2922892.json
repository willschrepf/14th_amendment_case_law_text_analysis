REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\ntunities for women in the nation’s schools and universities, so\nmuch so that a company that sells women’s athletic apparel\nnow mimics its name. See www.titlenine.com. Despite that\nrenown, the district court in this case held that a university\nthat receives federal funds cannot be held liable in damages\nfor failing effectively to accommodate the athletic interests of\nboth men and women unless the aggrieved women first pro-\nvide the appropriate university officials with notice of their\ndisadvantageous treatment and an opportunity to cure it.\n\n   We disagree and so, with respect to the central issue in this\ncase, reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment\non that ground. We hold as well that the defendant university\nis not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground\nthat it has complied with Title IX. We also reverse the order\ndismissing the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n            FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Arezou Mansourian, Lauren Mancuso, and Christine Wing-\nSi Ng (hereafter plaintiffs or students) are women who wres-\ntled in high school and chose to attend the University of Cali-\nfornia, Davis (UCD) so they could participate in the\nuniversity’s acclaimed wrestling program, which had long\nprovided opportunities for women.1 The plaintiffs participated\nin varsity wrestling and enjoyed the benefits associated with\nvarsity status: training, coaching, and laundry services; aca-\ndemic tutoring; insurance; and access to varsity facilities and\nequipment.2 UCD did not operate separate wrestling teams for\n  1\n     Nancy Chiang, an additional plaintiff named in the complaint, was on\na leave of absence from UCD when the complaint was filed. She dis-\nmissed her claims in June 2007. Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso graduated\nfrom UCD during the course of the litigation.\n   2\n     UCD disputes the very existence of a women’s varsity wrestling pro-\ngram, insisting that the plaintiffs were merely “permitted to practice with\nthe wrestling team.” UCD acknowledges, however, that the plaintiffs “par-\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA 2215\nmen and women; a handful of women wrestlers participated\nin what was largely a men’s team, practicing with the men\nand receiving coaching from Coach Mike Burch.\n\n   During the 2000-2001 academic year, UCD eliminated all\nwomen from the wrestling team. After the students protested\nto UCD administrators and filed a complaint with the Office\nfor Civil Rights (OCR),3 UCD agreed to permit women again\nto participate in varsity wrestling. Their participation, how-\never, was conditioned on their ability to beat male wrestlers\nin their weight class, using men’s collegiate wrestling rules.\n(Prior to their elimination from the team, women wrestlers at\nUCD had competed only against other women and used inter-\nnational freestyle rules.) As a result of the new requirement\nthat they compete against men under men’s rules, the female\nstudents were unable to participate on the wrestling team and\nlost the benefits associated with varsity status, including\nscholarships and academic credit.\n\n   The students then filed a class action against UCD and sev-\neral UCD officials in their individual and official capacities,\non behalf of all current and future female UCD students\ndenied equal athletic participation opportunities. The plain-\ntiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under Title IX and\nalso asserted equal protection claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.4\n\nticipated in wrestling” and that Mansourian, at least, was “on the wrestling\nteam roster” and received varsity-associated benefits. Moreover, UCD\nlisted four female varsity wrestlers in its 1999-2000 athletics report pursu-\nant to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). View-\ning the facts in favor of the plaintiffs on UCD’s motion for summary\njudgment, we conclude that the plaintiffs were varsity wrestlers for pur-\nposes of Title IX.\n   3\n     OCR is the division of the United States Department of Education\ncharged with enforcing Title IX.\n   4\n     The Title IX claims are asserted only against the university. The indi-\nvidual defendants are Larry Vanderhoef, University Chancellor; Greg\nWarzecka, Athletic Director; Pam Gill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson,\nAssociate Athletic Directors; and Robert Franks, Associate Vice Chancel-\nlor for Student Affairs. We refer to the individual defendants and the Uni-\nversity collectively as “UCD.”\n\f2216 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA\n   Just before the scheduled hearing on class certification, the\nplaintiffs requested a stay due to their attorney’s serious ill-\nness. During the ten-month stay, Mancuso, the only named\nplaintiff still attending UCD at that point, graduated. As soon\nas the stay ended, the plaintiffs moved to add as plaintiffs\nthree students, Kelsey Brust, Laura Ludwig, and Jessica\nBulala, all still enrolled at UCD. The district court refused to\nallow the amendment, holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet\nthe good cause required under Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 16 when such a motion is filed after the issuance of a\nscheduling order. See Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc.,\n975 F.2d 604, 607-08 (9th Cir. 1992). Without any named\nplaintiffs currently attending UCD, the plaintiffs stipulated to\ndismissal of the class claims for injunctive relief.\n\n   The district court subsequently dismissed the § 1983 claim\nas “subsumed” by the Title IX claim, citing Middlesex County\nSewer Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass’n., 453 U.S.\n1 (1981). The district court then granted UCD’s motion for\nsummary judgment, holding that the students were required,\nto perfect their claim, to give UCD notice in advance of filing\nsuit of the alleged Title IX violation and an opportunity to\ncure it, and had failed to do so. The students timely appealed.\n\n                           ANALYSIS\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s dismissal on the\npleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), Dunlap v. Credit Protection\nAss’n, L.P., 419 F.3d 1011, 1012 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005), as well\nas the grant of summary judgment. Avista Corp. Inc. v. Wolfe,\n549 F.3d 1239, 1246 (9th Cir. 2008). We review the denial of\na motion to amend under Rule 16(b) for abuse of discretion.\nNoyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, 1174 n.6 (9th Cir.\n2006).\n\n  Before proceeding to discuss the merits of this case, we\nconsider whether we have jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs’\nchallenge to the district court’s denial of their motion to add\n\f      MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY   OF   CALIFORNIA 2217\nBrust, Bulala, and Ludwig as plaintiffs. We hold that this\nissue is moot and so beyond our jurisdiction, for the reasons\nwe now explain.\n\n   [1] After the district court denied the motion, Brust,\nBulala, and Ludwig initiated a separate lawsuit against UCD.\nThe district court certified a class of “[a]ll present, prospec-\ntive, and future women students at [UCD] who seek to partici-\npate in and/or who are deterred from participating in\nintercollegiate athletics at [UCD].” Stipulated Judgment and\nOrder at 1, Brust v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 07-1488\n(E.D. Cal. Oct. 19, 2009). The parties to the Brust action\nreached a settlement, approved by the district court, which\n“resolves all class member claims for injunctive relief.” Id. at\n10. Moreover, Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala have now graduated\nfrom UCD. It is therefore apparent that, even if the district\ncourt had erred in denying the motion to add Brust, Ludwig,\nand Bulala initially, which we do not decide, they would no\nlonger be appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation for the pur-\nposes of injunctive relief, as the current plaintiffs recognize.\nSee Flint v. Dennison, 488 F.3d 816, 824 (9th Cir. 2007)\n(“Generally, once a student graduates, he no longer has a live\ncase or controversy justifying declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst a school’s action or policy, and his case is therefore\nmoot.”); Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch., 228 F.3d 1092,\n1099 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding, where the two original plain-\ntiffs had graduated and a third, later-joined plaintiff subse-\nquently graduated before the appeal, that all three lacked\nstanding to seek injunctive relief).\n\n   The plaintiffs contend, however, that the Brust settlement\ndoes not preclude current female students from seeking the\nspecific injunctive relief — not awarded as part of the Brust\nsettlement — of restoring the women’s wrestling program.\nThat may be so; we need not decide whether it is or not. There\nare no current students in this case seeking that relief; no\nidentified, current students looking to intervene in this case to\nseek that relief; and no identified, current students whom the\n\f2218 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY             OF   CALIFORNIA\nplaintiffs seek to add to the case for purposes of obtaining that\nrelief.\n\n   [2] We therefore may not reach the merits of the claim that\nthe district court improperly denied the motion to add new\nplaintiffs, as there is presently no cognizable dispute that\nwould be affected by such a determination.5 See, e.g., McQuil-\nlion v. Schwarzenegger, 369 F.3d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(holding that a prisoner’s successful habeas petition and sub-\nsequent relief rendered moot his claim for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief under § 1983); Porter v. Jones, 319 F.3d\n483, 489 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that a case or issue becomes\nmoot when “the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in\nthe outcome” (quotation omitted)); Di Giorgio v. Lee (In re\nDi Giorgio), 134 F.3d 971, 974 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that\ntenants’ challenge to a state statute permitting their eviction\nwas moot after they voluntarily vacated the property).\n\n  [3] Turning to the merits of the students’ damages claims,\nwe begin by setting out the statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork governing Title IX athletics cases. Title IX provides that\n\n      [n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n      sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n  5\n    The parties did not inform this court before oral argument that (1) the\nputative additional plaintiffs had also all graduated and (2) those plaintiffs\nhad settled their separate lawsuit for class injunctive relief and were await-\ning approval of that settlement by the district court. We as judges take our\nresponsibilities seriously, preparing carefully before argument on all\nissues presented in the briefs. Where, as here, the complexion of the case\nhas entirely changed while the appeal is pending, counsel for both parties\nhave an obligation to so inform the court. That is so even if a party\nbelieves it has a basis for arguing that the issue should still be decided.\n   No such notice of changed circumstances was given here. Instead, the\npanel learned only at argument that Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala had gradu-\nated, and learned only after independent post-argument research that there\nwas a motion pending, to be heard in a matter of days, for approval of a\nsettlement for broad-ranging injunctive relief in the Brust litigation.\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA 2219\n     benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n     any education program or activity receiving Federal\n     financial assistance.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). As applied to intercollegiate athletics,\nthe Department of Education’s Title IX regulations interpret\nthe statute as requiring funding recipients to “provide equal\nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 106.41(c).6\n\n   [4] The regulations establish two components of Title IX’s\nequal athletic opportunity requirement: “effective accommo-\ndation” and “equal treatment.” “Effective accommodation”\nTitle IX requirements derive from the Title IX regulation at\n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1), which bases Title IX compliance in\npart on whether “the selection of sports and levels of competi-\ntion effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of\nmembers of both sexes.”7 The “equal treatment” Title IX stan-\ndard, in contrast, derives from 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)-(10),\nwhich has been interpreted by OCR to require “equivalence\nin the availability, quality and kinds of other athletic benefits\nand opportunities provided male and female athletes.”8\n   6\n     The existence of a private right of action to enforce Title IX is well-\nestablished and not at issue in this case. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago,\n441 U.S. 677 (1979).\n   7\n     “Effective accommodation” as a doctrine within Title IX jurisprudence\nis analytically distinct from similarly titled doctrines under other statutes\n— for example, the obligation to “mak[e] reasonable accommodations to\nthe known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individ-\nual with a disability” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5).\n   8\n     The regulation requires OCR to consider, in assessing whether equal\nopportunities are available to students of both sexes:\n    The provision of equipment and supplies; [s]cheduling of games\n    and practice time; [t]ravel and per diem allowance; [o]pportunity\n    to receive coaching and academic tutoring; [a]ssignment and\n    compensation of coaches and tutors; [p]rovision of locker rooms,\n    practice and competitive facilities; [p]rovision of medical and\n    training facilities and services; [p]rovision of housing and dining\n    facilities and services; [p]ublicity.\n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c).\n\f2220 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY             OF   CALIFORNIA\nDepartment of Education Office for Civil Rights, Clarification\nof Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part\nTest (Clarification) (1996), available at http://www.ed.gov/\nabout/offices/list/ocr/docs/clarific.html. Effective accommo-\ndation claims thus concern the opportunity to participate in\nathletics, while equal treatment claims allege sex-based differ-\nences in the schedules, equipment, coaching, and other factors\naffecting participants in athletics. See McCormick v. Sch. Dist.\nof Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 299 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding\nthat a competition schedule permitting male but not female\nhigh school soccer players to participate in state and regional\nchampionships deprived female players of equal treatment\nunder Title IX); see also Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213\nF.3d 858, 865 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000) (explaining the relationship\nbetween effective accommodation and equal treatment\nclaims); Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 115 n.1 (2d\nCir. 1999) (same). So “an institution may violate Title IX\nsolely by failing to accommodate effectively the interests and\nabilities of student athletes of both sexes,” even if the benefits\nprovided athletes of both sexes are equivalent. Kelley v. Bd.\nof Trs., 35 F.3d 265, 268 (7th Cir. 1994); see also Roberts v.\nColo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 828 (10th Cir. 1993);\nCohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 897 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n  Whether a funding recipient has met its “effective accom-\nmodation” obligation is determined using a “three-part test”\ndrawn from OCR’s 1979 Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg.\n71,413 (Dec. 11, 1979), and further elaborated in OCR’s 1996\nClarification.9 Congress has specifically authorized OCR to\npromulgate regulations governing intercollegiate athletics,10\n  9\n    We and other circuits have held that both the Policy Interpretation and\nthe Clarification are entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural\nRes. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984), and Martin v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 499 U.S. 144, 150 (1991). See\nNeal v. Bd. of Trs., 198 F.3d 763, 770, 771 (9th Cir. 1999); accord\nChalenor v. Univ. of N.D., 291 F.3d 1042, 1047 (8th Cir. 2002); Kelley,\n35 F.3d at 270-71; Cohen, 991 F.2d at 896-97.\n   10\n      “Intercollegiate” refers to varsity and junior varsity teams, as opposed\nto club or intramural teams, which do not receive coaching or athletic\nscholarships and other benefits listed in the regulations. See supra note 8.\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY     OF   CALIFORNIA 2221\nsee Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 612 (1974), and the\nresulting three-part test gives universities three options for\ndemonstrating compliance with Title IX: (1) showing substan-\ntial proportionality (the number of women in intercollegiate\nathletics is proportionate to their enrollment); (2) proving that\nthe institution has a “history and continuing practice of pro-\ngram expansion” for the underrepresented sex (in this case,\nwomen); or (3) where the university cannot satisfy either of\nthe first two options, establishing that it nonetheless “fully\nand effectively accommodate[s]” the interests of women. 44\nFed. Reg. 71,418.\n\n   [5] Funding recipients can satisfy any of the three options\nto comply with Title IX. UCD claims to have satisfied the\nsecond option by showing a history and continuing practice of\nprogram expansion.11 Compliance with this option “focuses\non whether an institution has expanded the number of inter-\ncollegiate participation opportunities” for women, but pro-\nvides institutions “flexibility in choosing which teams [they]\nadd[ ].” Clarification nn. 2-3. The number of “participation\nopportunities” for women is defined by the number of female\nathletes actually playing intercollegiate sports.\n\n   The district court determined that the plaintiffs had ade-\nquately pleaded a claim for effective accommodation under\nTitle IX by alleging that UCD “chooses to make fewer ath-\nletic participation opportunities [available] to female students\nthan to male students.” The district court did not, however,\nreach the merits of whether UCD complied with Option Two,\ninstead concluding that “money damages cannot be awarded\nunless a plaintiff has given notice of and an opportunity to\nrectify the specific violation alleged by a Title IX plaintiff.”\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to provide such notice,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to UCD.\n  11\n    The record does not demonstrate that UCD has complied with either\nOption One or Option Three, and UCD does not contend that it has.\n\f2222 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA\n  This circuit has yet to address whether any such require-\nment applies in the athletics context. We conclude that it does\nnot.\n\n   [6] UCD’s notice argument, adopted by the district court,\nproceeds by analogy to the Supreme Court’s holding that\nnotice and an opportunity to cure a violation is an essential\nprecursor to a sexual harassment suit for damages under Title\nIX. We therefore begin by discussing the pertinent Title IX\nsexual harassment cases. As will appear, the analogy between\nthis case and those is not apt.\n\n   The starting point for this inquiry is Franklin v. Gwinnett\nCounty Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), in which the\ndefendant school district was aware of a teacher’s sexual\nharassment of a student but took no action to stop it. The\nCourt recognized that Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28-29 (1981), precludes the award of\ndamages for unintentional violations of statutes, like Title IX,\nenacted pursuant to Congress’s spending authority. See\nFranklin, 503 U.S. at 74. Franklin held, however, that the\nfailure to halt harassment of which a school district is aware\nconstitutes intentional discrimination for which monetary\ndamages are an appropriate remedy. Id. at 75-76.\n\n   Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S.\n274 (1998), further defined the scope of a school’s monetary\nliability under Title IX for inaction in the face of serious sex-\nual harassment. In Gebser, the Court held that principles of\nrespondeat superior and constructive notice are inadequate to\nimpose Title IX liability on a school district for a teacher’s\nsexual abuse of a high school student. Id. at 285. Noting that\nTitle IX’s express enforcement scheme, termination of federal\nfunding, requires “an opportunity for voluntary compliance”\nbefore suspending or terminating funding, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1682, Gebser held that the judicially implied private right of\naction similarly should not impose liability “without regard to\nthe recipient’s knowledge or its corrective actions upon\n\f        MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA 2223\nreceiving notice.” Id. at 289. Monetary damages premised on\nconstructive notice or respondeat superior for sexual harass-\nment, the Court held in Gebser, would entail a risk that “the\nrecipient of funds was unaware of the discrimination.” Id. at\n287. Rather,\n\n       in cases like this one that do not involve official pol-\n       icy of the recipient entity, . . . a damages remedy will\n       not lie under Title IX unless an official who . . . has\n       authority to address the alleged discrimination and to\n       institute corrective measures . . . has actual knowl-\n       edge of discrimination . . . and fails adequately to\n       respond.\n\nId. at 290 (emphasis added).\n\n   [7] Critically for present purposes, Gebser does not make\npre-litigation notice of an alleged violation a prerequisite to\nrecovery in every Title IX case, or even in every sexual\nharassment case. Proof of actual notice is required only when\nthe alleged Title IX violation consists of an institution’s delib-\nerate indifference to acts that “do not involve official policy\nof the recipient entity.” Id. In sexual harassment cases, it is\nthe deliberate failure to curtail known harassment, rather than\nthe harassment itself, that constitutes the intentional Title IX\nviolation.12 See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526\nU.S. 629, 641 (1999) (holding that Gebser permits the plain-\ntiff “to hold the Board liable for its own decision to remain\nidle in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its\nschools.”). The Tenth Circuit has held that a corollary of this\nprinciple is that where the official policy is one of deliberate\nindifference to a known overall risk of sexual harassment,\nnotice of a particular harassment situation and an opportunity\n  12\n    The harassment itself may be actionable under state law or 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292.\n\f2224 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY            OF   CALIFORNIA\nto cure it are not predicates for liability. See Simpson v. Univ.\nof Colo. Boulder, 500 F.3d 1170 (10th Cir. 2007).13\n\n   [8] Consistent with the reasoning underlying Gebser, the\nSupreme Court has made clear that no notice requirement is\napplicable to Title IX claims that rest on an affirmative insti-\ntutional decision. Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education,\n544 U.S. 167 (2005), held that a high school athletics coach\nfired in retaliation for complaining about discrimination in\nathletics funding had a private right of action under Title IX.\nThe Court held that no pre-litigation notice is required in the\nretaliation context. In Gebser and Davis, the Court stated, “we\nemphasized that [the notice] limitation on private damages\nactions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient inten-\ntionally violates the statute.” Id. at 182 (quotation omitted).\nAs retaliation is “easily attributable to the funding recipient\nand it is always — by definition — intentional,” id., the Court\nallowed Jackson’s retaliation claim to proceed without regard\nto whether adequate pre-litigation notice and opportunity to\ncure the violation had been provided.\n\n   [9] Universities’ decisions with respect to athletics are\neven more “easily attributable to the funding recipient and . . .\nalways — by definition — intentional,” id. at 183, than the\nretaliation in Jackson. Institutions, not individual actors,\n   13\n      Simpson concerned two female University of Colorado (CU) students\nsexually assaulted by football players and high school football recruits.\nThe Tenth Circuit held that Gebser’s notice standard did not apply. The\nrecord supported the finding that the head football coach was aware of\n“the serious risk of sexual . . . assault during college-football recruiting\nefforts [and] that such assaults had indeed occurred during CU recruiting\nvisits,” Simpson, 500 F.3d at 1184, and that, although the Boulder District\nAttorney’s office had recommended a policy to curb such assaults after a\nprevious incident involving recruits, the policy was not followed and CU\ncontinued to sponsor an “unsupervised player-host program to show high-\nschool recruits ‘a good time.’ ” Id. The court held this sequence of events\nsatisfied the “official policy” element of Gebser and that a woman\nassaulted thereafter need provide no separate notice and opportunity to\ncure before filing suit.\n\f      MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA 2225\ndecide how to allocate resources between male and female\nathletic teams. Decisions to create or eliminate teams or to\nadd or decrease roster slots for male or female athletes are\nofficial decisions, not practices by individual students or staff.\nAthletic programs that fail effectively to accommodate stu-\ndents of both sexes thus represent “official policy of the recip-\nient entity” and so are not covered by Gebser’s notice\nrequirement. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290.\n\n   Moreover, a judicially imposed notice requirement would\nbe superfluous in light of universities’ ongoing obligations to\ncertify compliance with Title IX’s athletics requirements and\nto track athletics gender equity data. OCR regulations require\nfunding recipients to evaluate their policies and certify, as a\ncondition for receiving funds, that they are “tak[ing] whatever\nremedial action is necessary . . to eliminate . . . discrimina-\ntion.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.4; see also id. § 106.3. UCD and other\nfunding recipients therefore have an affirmative obligation to\nensure compliance with at least one prong of the three-part\neffective accommodation test.\n\n   The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) further\nrequires federally funded universities to report to the Depart-\nment of Education and make available to students the number\nof undergraduates and athletes, broken down by sex, as well\nas sex-segregated data on operating expenses, coach salaries,\nathletic scholarships, recruiting expenditures, and revenues.\n20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). UCD’s EADA reports contain ample\ndata demonstrating that it could not satisfy the substantial pro-\nportionality option and that the trend of increasing female ath-\nletic participation reversed after 2001, indicating that UCD\nmay not have had a continuing practice of program expansion.\nThus, where the alleged harm is unequal provision of athletic\nopportunity, the notice requirement would not supply univer-\nsities with information of which they are legitimately\nunaware. See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 289.\n\n  [10] We conclude for these reasons that pre-litigation\nnotice and opportunity to cure is not necessary in cases alleg-\n\f2226 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA\ning unequal provision of athletic opportunities in violation of\nTitle IX. Applying the notice requirement to institutional\ndecisions would contravene the clear language of Gebser and\nits progeny. It would also be inconsistent with funding recipi-\nents’ affirmative obligations to provide nondiscriminatory\nathletic participation opportunities and continually to assess\nand certify compliance with Title IX.\n\n  The Fifth Circuit has reached the same conclusion we do,\nholding that\n\n    the requirement in the sexual harassment cases —\n    that the academic institution have actual knowledge\n    of the sexual harassment — is not applicable for pur-\n    poses of determining whether an academic institu-\n    tion intentionally discriminated on the basis of sex\n    by denying females equal athletic opportunity. . . . In\n    the instant case, it is the institution itself that is dis-\n    criminating.\n\nPederson, 213 F.3d at 882. The Eighth Circuit, the only other\ncircuit to address the issue, has assumed, without any analy-\nsis, that Gebser’s notice requirement applies equally to Title\nIX cases where plaintiffs allege discrimination in the adminis-\ntration of an athletic program. Grandson v. Univ. of Minn,,\n272 F.3d 568, 575 (8th Cir. 2001). But the plaintiffs in\nGrandson did not argue otherwise, id., and the Eighth Circuit\nreached the merits of a later Title IX athletics case without\nmentioning Grandson, Gebser, or the notice requirement. See\nChalenor, 291 F.3d 1042. It is therefore far from clear that\nGrandson is controlling even in the Eighth Circuit. If it is,\nthen the circuits are already split on the issue, and we find the\nFifth Circuit’s holding (and that of the Tenth Circuit in Simp-\nson, on a different but related issue) the more persuasive, for\nreasons already surveyed.\n\n  [11] We therefore join the Fifth Circuit in holding that\nGebser’s notice requirement is inapplicable to cases alleging\n\f      MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY   OF   CALIFORNIA 2227\nthat a funding recipient has failed effectively to accommodate\nwomen’s interest in athletics. The district court’s decision\ngranting summary judgment on that basis is reversed.\n\n   UCD also moved for summary judgment on the grounds\nthat the record demonstrated “a history and continuing prac-\ntice of program expansion” for women that satisfied Option\nTwo of the three-part test. Although the district court granted\nsummary judgment on the notice grounds discussed above,\nUCD contends that we could, alternatively, affirm the district\ncourt’s decision on the merits. See Atel Fin. Corp. v. Quaker\nCoal Co., 321 F.3d 924, 926 (9th Cir. 2003). That is so, but\nonly if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nstudents, there are no genuine issues of material fact concern-\ning UCD’s compliance with Option Two. See, e.g., Becerril\nv. Pima County Assessor’s Office, 587 F.3d 1162, 1163 (9th\nCir. 2009). On the record before us we cannot affirm on this\nalternative ground.\n\n   [12] In assessing compliance with Option Two, we must,\nunder the Clarification, focus on both the institution’s record\nof adding female participation opportunities and its current\n“plan of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive\nto the developing interests and abilities” of women. “History”\nand “continuing practice” thus constitute two separate inqui-\nries. We conclude that the undisputed facts fall short of dem-\nonstrating UCD’s compliance with either facet of Option\nTwo.\n\n  [13] The Clarification specifies the following factors as\nevidence of an institution’s history of program expansion:\n\n    [A]n institution’s record of adding intercollegiate\n    teams, or upgrading teams to intercollegiate status,\n    for [women]; an institution’s record of increasing the\n    number of participants in intercollegiate athletics\n    who are [women]; and an institution’s affirmative\n\f2228 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\n       responses to requests by students or others for addi-\n       tion or elevation of sports.\n\nThe Option Two analysis focuses primarily, but not exclu-\nsively, on increasing the number of women athletes rather\nthan increasing the number of women’s teams. “OCR will\nassess whether past actions of the institution have expanded\nparticipation opportunities for the underrepresented sex . . .”\n(emphasis added). The number of “participation opportuni-\nties” is defined by the number of female athletes actually\nplaying intercollegiate sports.\n\n   UCD had seven women’s teams in 1970 and added another\nin 1974, thereby increasing the number of female varsity ath-\nletes. The record indicates that UCD did not further expand\nparticipation opportunities for women until 1996. The 1991\nReport of the UCD Title IX Review Committee (Report) indi-\ncated that UCD did not comprehensively review its compli-\nance with Title IX between 1976 and 1991. The Report also\nstated that since 1976, UCD had added two women’s sports\n(soccer and cross country track) but dropped two (golf and\nfield hockey).14 The Report concluded that UCD’s record\n“cannot be termed a demonstrably responsive process of pro-\ngram expansion . . . particularly when female participation\nrelative to male participation has been decreasing over the\npast three years.” Internal UCD memoranda from directors of\nthe athletics program suggest that the numerical participation\ngap continued to grow over the next two years.15\n  14\n      UCD does not dispute that it eliminated field hockey but denies that\nit eliminated a women’s golf team, asserting that UCD “attempted” to start\na women’s golf team in the 1970s that “never got off the ground.” Draw-\ning all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, as we must, we\ncredit UCD’s internal report as accurately describing the elimination of a\nwomen’s golf team.\n   15\n      In 1992 an associate athletic director warned of a “backward slide in\ncompliance,” and in 1993 UCD’s acting athletic director noted that “the\nratio of women participating has decreased slightly in recent years.”\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY         OF   CALIFORNIA 2229\n   In 1995, UCD decided to add three women’s varsity teams.\nThe university reviewed proposals from five women’s club\nteams and elevated water polo, crew and lacrosse to varsity\nstatus. When the three new teams began competing the fol-\nlowing year, the number of female athletes rose from 211 to\n348, with the difference between female enrollment and\nfemale participation in athletics dropping from twenty percent\nto eleven percent.\n\n   UCD represents that it created another women’s varsity\nteam, indoor track, in 1999. The addition of indoor track,\nhowever, cannot be considered evidence of program expan-\nsion. It did nothing to expand the number of female athletes,\nas all the women participating in indoor track also partici-\npated in an existing varsity sport. See Cohen v. Brown Univ.,\n809 F. Supp. 978, 991 (D.R.I. 1992), aff’d, 991 F.2d 888 (1st\nCir. 1993) (dismissing the alleged addition of winter track as\n“a sport that merely involved providing indoor space to the\nexisting women’s track team”). Nonetheless, the number of\nwomen athletes did continue to rise. In the 1999-2000 school\nyear, women varsity athletes at UCD reached a historic high\nin both total numbers and proportion of female athletes to\nenrolled women students.\n\n   Subsequently, however, the number of women playing\nintercollegiate athletics dropped sharply. Meanwhile, in the\nten years since UCD last added a significant number of\nfemale varsity slots, the number of female students at UCD\ngrew by 35%. Rather than keeping pace with this growth in\nwomen’s enrollment, the number of female athletes fluctuated\nbut never regained the apex it reached in 2000.\n\n   [14] In sum, UCD expanded varsity opportunities for\nwomen only between 1996 and 2000. UCD’s elimination of\nwomen from the varsity wrestling team thus took place in the\ncontext of an overall contraction of female athletic participa-\ntion opportunities that began in 2000.16 UCD’s post-2000\n  16\n   As noted, supra note 2, the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient facts\nshowing the existence of female varsity wrestling opportunities to survive\n\f2230 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\nstrategy for sports equality between the sexes appears to have\nconsisted of reducing varsity athletics overall, and in the pro-\ncess reducing men’s participation more than women’s partici-\npation by using “roster management” to limit the size of\nmen’s teams. The Clarification explicitly precludes consider-\ning such reductions as evidencing program expansion:\n\n     OCR will not find a history and continuing practice\n     of program expansion where an institution increases\n     the proportional participation opportunities for\n     [women] by reducing opportunities for [men] alone\n     or by reducing participation opportunities for [men]\n     to a proportionately greater degree than for [women].\n     . . . [Option Two] considers an institution’s good\n     faith remedial efforts through actual program expan-\n     sion. . . . Cuts in the program for [women], even\n     when coupled with cuts in the program for [men],\n     cannot be considered remedial because they burden\n     members of the sex already disadvantaged by the\n     present program.\n\n  [15] An institution that has eliminated some participation\nopportunities for women can still satisfy Option Two if the\n\nsummary judgment. UCD’s subsequent decision to permit women to com-\npete against men for a slot on the team does not affect our analysis. By\nrequiring women to prevail against men, the university changed the condi-\ntions under which women could participate in varsity wrestling in a man-\nner that foreseeably precluded their future participation.\n   UCD’s contention that it “ha[d] not declared wrestling to be a contact\nsport” does not advance its position. First, wrestling is a contact sport\nunder OCR regulations. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b). While women must be per-\nmitted to try out for all-male teams if there is no women’s team in that\nsport, this requirement is waived for contact sports. Id. But the contact-\nsport “exemption did not give [UCD] license to discriminate against [the\nplaintiffs] because of their sex once [UCD] decided to allow [them] to join\nthe team.” Mercer v. Duke Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 202 (4th Cir. 2005) (cita-\ntion omitted).\n\f        MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY       OF   CALIFORNIA 2231\nelimination is offset by a strong history of program expansion.\nIn UCD’s case, however, the elimination of women’s wres-\ntling opportunities occurred in the context of a women’s ath-\nletics program that was, at best, stagnant. We therefore hold\nthat UCD has not had a history of program expansion for\nwomen and so did not satisfy Option Two through such a his-\ntory.\n\n  The 1996 Clarification lists two factors that may indicate a\ncontinuing practice of program expansion:\n\n       [A]n institution’s current implementation of a non-\n       discriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the\n       addition of sports (including the elevation of club or\n       intramural teams) and the effective communication\n       of the policy or procedure to students; and an institu-\n       tion’s current implementation of a plan of program\n       expansion that is responsive to developing interests\n       and abilities.\n\n   The record contains undisputed evidence that UCD has a\nprocedure for requesting additional varsity sports and effec-\ntively communicates that procedure to students. According to\nthe procedure distributed to students, the “primary factor” in\nUCD’s evaluation of proposals to create new varsity teams is\nthe “[o]verall impact on intercollegiate program gender equi-\nty.” In 2003, UCD received detailed applications from mem-\nbers of four women’s club sports (bowling, horse polo, field\nhockey, and rugby) seeking elevation to varsity status. These\napplications indicate that students are aware of the opportu-\nnity to request new varsity athletic opportunities.17\n  17\n    UCD points to its Title IX Compliance Officer and grievance proce-\ndure as evidence of a practice of program expansion. As both are required\nby OCR regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 106.8, and neither affects the number of\nfemale athletes or teams, they do not indicate program expansion for pur-\nposes of Option Two.\n\f2232 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA\n   The 2003 application was the field hockey club team’s sec-\nond attempt to regain varsity status. An earlier application\nwas rejected in 1995. At that time, the Title IX Advisory\nCommittee advocated elevating lacrosse rather than field\nhockey to varsity status but noted that field hockey had “de-\nveloped strong interest from students” and was “a relatively\nstrong NCAA sport,” with three Division I teams competing\nat nearby universities. The committee recommended that\n“[s]hould gender equity not be achieved by the addition of the\nthree sports proposed, and funding be available in the future,\nfield hockey would be considered a prime candidate for addi-\ntion to the ICA program in the future.”\n\n   When field hockey club players applied for varsity status in\n2003, however, their application was again denied. In fact,\nUCD rejected all four club team applications, even though all\napplicants were evaluated as “successful” and “active” club\nteams with “a long tradition of participation.” Instead, UCD\ndecided to create a women’s golf team at the behest of the\nmen’s golf coach.\n\n   UCD contends that the fact that golf was proposed by the\nmen’s golf coach rather than female students is irrelevant. We\ndisagree. Universities are free to consider applications from\nindividuals other than students, and it is appropriate to evalu-\nate interest at the high school level as well as among current\nUCD students. A funding recipient can only satisfy Option\nTwo, however, by showing an expansion of participation\nopportunities that is “demonstrably responsive to [women’s]\ndeveloping interests and abilities . . . includ[ing] interests that\nalready exist at the institution.” The fact that there were no\nwomen currently attending UCD who were interested enough\nin golf to participate at the club level or to request varsity sta-\ntus suggests that the addition of golf instead of field hockey,\nbowling, horse polo or rugby was not “demonstratively\nresponsive” to the interests of current female students.\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY     OF   CALIFORNIA 2233\n   Moreover, UCD’s selection of golf, which added only\nseven participation opportunities for women, was at odds with\nits stated priority of taking a significant step toward overall\ngender equity. Elevating horse polo, rugby or field hockey\nwould have added far more female varsity athletes.18\n\n   We recognize that budgetary constraints often prevent uni-\nversities from creating new teams and adding varsity slots.\nBut “Title IX does not require that a school pour ever-\nincreasing sums into its athletic establishment.” Cohen v.\nBrown Univ., 991 F.2d at 898-99 n.15. Universities may\nachieve compliance by reducing men’s athletic slots until par-\nticipation rates become substantially proportionate to the\nundergraduate population. Id.; Neal, 198 F.3d at 771; Kelley,\n35 F.3d at 270; Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830. They may not, how-\never, maintain varsity teams for male students while denying\nfemale students comparable “opportunities to enjoy the thrill\nof victory, the agony of defeat, and the many tangible benefits\nthat flow from just being given a chance to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics.” Neal, 198 F.3d at 773.\n\n   [16] UCD took a significant step towards Title IX compli-\nance by adding three women’s teams in 1996, but Option Two\nrequires more than a single step. It requires evidence of con-\ntinuous progress toward the mandate of gender equality that\nTitle IX has imposed on funding recipients for the past thirty\nyears. The record before us does not contain undisputed facts\nshowing a history and continuing practice of program expan-\nsion that is responsive to women’s interests.\n\n   [17] We conclude that the grant of summary judgment to\nUCD cannot be affirmed on the alternative merits ground that\nUCD complies with Title IX’s requirement of providing equal\nathletic opportunities to students of both sexes.\n  18\n    UCD’s review committee estimated that field hockey would add 22\nfemale athletes; horse polo, 35; rugby, 30 to 40. Bowling would have\nadded 12 to 15.\n\f2234 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA\n   The students also sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that\nUCD violates the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining an\nathletics program that discriminates on the basis of gender.\nThe district court dismissed the claim because it determined\nthat “Title IX’s enforcement scheme is sufficiently compre-\nhensive to . . . demonstrate that Congress intended to preclude\n§ 1983 claims when it enacted this statute.”\n\n   [18] Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee, 129 S. Ct.\n788 (2009), decided after the district court dismissed the stu-\ndents’ claims, held, to the contrary, that Title IX does not bar\n§ 1983 suits to enforce rights under the Equal Protection\nClause. As in Fitzgerald, the plaintiffs here invoke § 1983 to\nseek damages for violations of constitutional rights. See id. at\n796-97 (explaining distinctions between the rights created by\nTitle IX and those afforded by the Equal Protection Clause).\n\n   The defendants concede that the district court ruling does\nnot survive Fitzgerald but urge us to affirm dismissal of the\n§ 1983 claim on other grounds. We decline to do so, for rea-\nsons we now explain.\n\n   UCD first contends that the § 1983 claim for damages is\nprecluded by the statute of limitations and that the district\ncourt did not address this argument. In fact, the district court\nconsidered and rejected the statute of limitations defense as to\nboth the Title IX effective accommodation and § 1983 equal\nprotection claims in response to UCD’s original motion to\ndismiss. The court held that because the students claimed that\nthey were “currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly\nsex discriminatory practices . . . their claims accrue each and\nevery day they are denied equal access to athletic participa-\ntion.”\n\n  [19] The district court was quite correct. Section 1983 “is\npresumptively available to remedy a state’s ongoing violation\nof federal law.” AlohaCare v. Haw. Dep’t. of Human Servs.,\n572 F.3d 740, 745 (9th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). A\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY             OF   CALIFORNIA 2235\nplaintiff has adequately pled an ongoing claim if she can\n“show a systematic policy or practice that operated, in part,\nwithin the limitations period — a systematic violation.”\nDouglas v. Cal. Dep’t. of Youth Auth., 271 F.3d 812, 822 (9th\nCir. 2001) (quotation omitted); see also Gutowsky v. County\nof Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding plain-\ntiff’s § 1983 claims timely because she alleged “widespread\npolicy and practices of discrimination [that] continued every\nday of her employment, including days that fall within the\nlimitation period”).19 A university’s ongoing and intentional\nfailure to provide equal athletic opportunities for women is a\nsystemic violation. As the plaintiffs were students and there-\nfore subject to the policy that allegedly discriminated on the\nbasis of sex at the time they filed their complaint, their § 1983\nclaim is not time-barred.\n\n   [20] UCD next urges this court to conclude that the § 1983\nclaim against the individual defendants is precluded by the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity. The defendants, however, did\nnot raise a qualified immunity defense in any of their disposi-\ntive motions before the district court.20 Our discretion to\naffirm on grounds other than those relied on by the district\ncourt extends to issues raised in a manner providing the dis-\ntrict court an opportunity to rule on it. See Proctor v. Vishay\nIntertechnology, Inc., 584 F.3d 1208, 1226 (9th Cir. 2009);\nWashington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima\nIndian Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478 n.20 (1979) (“[T]he prevail-\ning party . . . was of course free to defend its judgment on any\nground properly raised below whether or not that ground was\nrelied upon, rejected, or even considered by the District Court.\n  19\n      Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002), held\nthat each “[d]iscrete act[ ] such as termination, failure to promote, denial\nof transfer or refusal to hire . . . constitutes a separate actionable ‘unlawful\n. . . practice’ ” for the purposes of triggering the statute of limitations\nperiod in a Title VII case. Morgan left undisturbed our case law governing\ncontinuing systemic violations.\n   20\n      UCD raised a qualified immunity defense in its answer to the stu-\ndents’ complaint but never litigated it thereafter.\n\f2236 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY   OF   CALIFORNIA\n. . .”) (emphasis added). As the district court has had no\nopportunity to rule on the individual defendants’ qualified\nimmunity defense, we will not affirm on that basis. The dis-\nmissal of the students’ § 1983 claim is therefore reversed.\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n\n  [21] For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion to\namend their complaint is dismissed as moot. The district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the\nTitle IX claim is reversed. The district court’s order dismiss-\ning the equal protection § 1983 claim is also reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\f",

REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\ntunities for women in the nation’s schools and universities, so\nmuch so that a company that sells women’s athletic apparel\nnow mimics its name. See www.titlenine.com. Despite that\nrenown, the district court in this case held that a university\nthat receives federal funds cannot be held liable in damages\nfor failing effectively to accommodate the athletic interests of\nboth men and women unless the aggrieved women first pro-\nvide the appropriate university officials with notice of their\ndisadvantageous treatment and an opportunity to cure it.\n\n   We disagree and so, with respect to the central issue in this\ncase, reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment\non that ground. We hold as well that the defendant university\nis not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground\nthat it has complied with Title IX. We also reverse the order\ndismissing the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n            FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Arezou Mansourian, Lauren Mancuso, and Christine Wing-\nSi Ng (hereafter plaintiffs or students) are women who wres-\ntled in high school and chose to attend the University of Cali-\nfornia, Davis (UCD) so they could participate in the\nuniversity’s acclaimed wrestling program, which had long\nprovided opportunities for women.1 The plaintiffs participated\nin varsity wrestling and enjoyed the benefits associated with\nvarsity status: training, coaching, and laundry services; aca-\ndemic tutoring; insurance; and access to varsity facilities and\nequipment.2 UCD did not operate separate wrestling teams for\n  1\n     Nancy Chiang, an additional plaintiff named in the complaint, was on\na leave of absence from UCD when the complaint was filed. She dis-\nmissed her claims in June 2007. Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso graduated\nfrom UCD during the course of the litigation.\n   2\n     UCD disputes the very existence of a women’s varsity wrestling pro-\ngram, insisting that the plaintiffs were merely “permitted to practice with\nthe wrestling team.” UCD acknowledges, however, that the plaintiffs “par-\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA 2215\nmen and women; a handful of women wrestlers participated\nin what was largely a men’s team, practicing with the men\nand receiving coaching from Coach Mike Burch.\n\n   During the 2000-2001 academic year, UCD eliminated all\nwomen from the wrestling team. After the students protested\nto UCD administrators and filed a complaint with the Office\nfor Civil Rights (OCR),3 UCD agreed to permit women again\nto participate in varsity wrestling. Their participation, how-\never, was conditioned on their ability to beat male wrestlers\nin their weight class, using men’s collegiate wrestling rules.\n(Prior to their elimination from the team, women wrestlers at\nUCD had competed only against other women and used inter-\nnational freestyle rules.) As a result of the new requirement\nthat they compete against men under men’s rules, the female\nstudents were unable to participate on the wrestling team and\nlost the benefits associated with varsity status, including\nscholarships and academic credit.\n\n   The students then filed a class action against UCD and sev-\neral UCD officials in their individual and official capacities,\non behalf of all current and future female UCD students\ndenied equal athletic participation opportunities. The plain-\ntiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under Title IX and\nalso asserted equal protection claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.4\n\nticipated in wrestling” and that Mansourian, at least, was “on the wrestling\nteam roster” and received varsity-associated benefits. Moreover, UCD\nlisted four female varsity wrestlers in its 1999-2000 athletics report pursu-\nant to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). View-\ning the facts in favor of the plaintiffs on UCD’s motion for summary\njudgment, we conclude that the plaintiffs were varsity wrestlers for pur-\nposes of Title IX.\n   3\n     OCR is the division of the United States Department of Education\ncharged with enforcing Title IX.\n   4\n     The Title IX claims are asserted only against the university. The indi-\nvidual defendants are Larry Vanderhoef, University Chancellor; Greg\nWarzecka, Athletic Director; Pam Gill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson,\nAssociate Athletic Directors; and Robert Franks, Associate Vice Chancel-\nlor for Student Affairs. We refer to the individual defendants and the Uni-\nversity collectively as “UCD.”\n\f2216 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA\n   Just before the scheduled hearing on class certification, the\nplaintiffs requested a stay due to their attorney’s serious ill-\nness. During the ten-month stay, Mancuso, the only named\nplaintiff still attending UCD at that point, graduated. As soon\nas the stay ended, the plaintiffs moved to add as plaintiffs\nthree students, Kelsey Brust, Laura Ludwig, and Jessica\nBulala, all still enrolled at UCD. The district court refused to\nallow the amendment, holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet\nthe good cause required under Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 16 when such a motion is filed after the issuance of a\nscheduling order.

REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY   OF   CALIFORNIA 2217\nBrust, Bulala, and Ludwig as plaintiffs. We hold that this\nissue is moot and so beyond our jurisdiction, for the reasons\nwe now explain.\n\n   [1] After the district court denied the motion, Brust,\nBulala, and Ludwig initiated a separate lawsuit against UCD.\nThe district court certified a class of “[a]ll present, prospec-\ntive, and future women students at [UCD] who seek to partici-\npate in and/or who are deterred from participating in\nintercollegiate athletics at [UCD].” Stipulated Judgment and\nOrder at 1, Brust v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 07-1488\n(E.D. Cal. Oct. 19, 2009). The parties to the Brust action\nreached a settlement, approved by the district court, which\n“resolves all class member claims for injunctive relief.” Id. at\n10. Moreover, Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala have now graduated\nfrom UCD. It is therefore apparent that, even if the district\ncourt had erred in denying the motion to add Brust, Ludwig,\nand Bulala initially, which we do not decide, they would no\nlonger be appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation for the pur-\nposes of injunctive relief, as the current plaintiffs recognize.\nSee Flint v.

There\nare no current students in this case seeking that relief; no\nidentified, current students looking to intervene in this case to\nseek that relief; and no identified, current students whom the\n\f2218 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY             OF   CALIFORNIA\nplaintiffs seek to add to the case for purposes of obtaining that\nrelief.\n\n   [2] We therefore may not reach the merits of the claim that\nthe district court improperly denied the motion to add new\nplaintiffs, as there is presently no cognizable dispute that\nwould be affected by such a determination.5 See, e.g., McQuil-\nlion v.

Title IX provides that\n\n      [n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n      sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n  5\n    The parties did not inform this court before oral argument that (1) the\nputative additional plaintiffs had also all graduated and (2) those plaintiffs\nhad settled their separate lawsuit for class injunctive relief and were await-\ning approval of that settlement by the district court. We as judges take our\nresponsibilities seriously, preparing carefully before argument on all\nissues presented in the briefs. Where, as here, the complexion of the case\nhas entirely changed while the appeal is pending, counsel for both parties\nhave an obligation to so inform the court. That is so even if a party\nbelieves it has a basis for arguing that the issue should still be decided.\n   No such notice of changed circumstances was given here. Instead, the\npanel learned only at argument that Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala had gradu-\nated, and learned only after independent post-argument research that there\nwas a motion pending, to be heard in a matter of days, for approval of a\nsettlement for broad-ranging injunctive relief in the Brust litigation.\n\f       MANSOURIAN v.

As applied to intercollegiate athletics,\nthe Department of Education’s Title IX regulations interpret\nthe statute as requiring funding recipients to “provide equal\nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 106.41(c).6\n\n   [4] The regulations establish two components of Title IX’s\nequal athletic opportunity requirement: “effective accommo-\ndation” and “equal treatment.” “Effective accommodation”\nTitle IX requirements derive from the Title IX regulation at\n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1), which bases Title IX compliance in\npart on whether “the selection of sports and levels of competi-\ntion effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of\nmembers of both sexes.”7 The “equal treatment” Title IX stan-\ndard, in contrast, derives from 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)-(10),\nwhich has been interpreted by OCR to require “equivalence\nin the availability, quality and kinds of other athletic benefits\nand opportunities provided male and female athletes.”8\n   6\n     The existence of a private right of action to enforce Title IX is well-\nestablished and not at issue in this case. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979).\n   7\n     “Effective accommodation” as a doctrine within Title IX jurisprudence\nis analytically distinct from similarly titled doctrines under other statutes\n— for example, the obligation to “mak[e] reasonable accommodations to\nthe known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individ-\nual with a disability” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5).\n   8\n     The regulation requires OCR to consider, in assessing whether equal\nopportunities are available to students of both sexes:\n    The provision of equipment and supplies; [s]cheduling of games\n    and practice time; [t]ravel and per diem allowance; [o]pportunity\n    to receive coaching and academic tutoring; [a]ssignment and\n    compensation of coaches and tutors; [p]rovision of locker rooms,\n    practice and competitive facilities; [p]rovision of medical and\n    training facilities and services; [p]rovision of housing and dining\n    facilities and services; [p]ublicity.\n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c).\n\f2220 MANSOURIAN v.

Reg. 71,418.\n\n   [5] Funding recipients can satisfy any of the three options\nto comply with Title IX. UCD claims to have satisfied the\nsecond option by showing a history and continuing practice of\nprogram expansion.11 Compliance with this option “focuses\non whether an institution has expanded the number of inter-\ncollegiate participation opportunities” for women, but pro-\nvides institutions “flexibility in choosing which teams [they]\nadd[ ].” Clarification nn. 2-3. The number of “participation\nopportunities” for women is defined by the number of female\nathletes actually playing intercollegiate sports.\n\n   The district court determined that the plaintiffs had ade-\nquately pleaded a claim for effective accommodation under\nTitle IX by alleging that UCD “chooses to make fewer ath-\nletic participation opportunities [available] to female students\nthan to male students.” The district court did not, however,\nreach the merits of whether UCD complied with Option Two,\ninstead concluding that “money damages cannot be awarded\nunless a plaintiff has given notice of and an opportunity to\nrectify the specific violation alleged by a Title IX plaintiff.”\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to provide such notice,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to UCD.\n  11\n    The record does not demonstrate that UCD has complied with either\nOption One or Option Three, and UCD does not contend that it has.\n\f2222 MANSOURIAN v.

The\nCourt recognized that Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110458\"><a href=\"/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28-29 (1981), precludes the award of\ndamages for unintentional violations of statutes, like Title IX,\nenacted pursuant to Congress’s spending authority. See\nFranklin, 503 U.S. at 74. Franklin held, however, that the\nfailure to halt harassment of which a school district is aware\nconstitutes intentional discrimination for which monetary\ndamages are an appropriate remedy. Id. at 75-76.\n\n   Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118232\"><a href=\"/opinion/118232/gebser-v-lago-vista-independent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), further defined the scope of a school’s monetary\nliability under Title IX for inaction in the face of serious sex-\nual harassment. In Gebser, the Court held that principles of\nrespondeat superior and constructive notice are inadequate to\nimpose Title IX liability on a school district for a teacher’s\nsexual abuse of a high school student. Id. at 285. Noting that\nTitle IX’s express enforcement scheme, termination of federal\nfunding, requires “an opportunity for voluntary compliance”\nbefore suspending or terminating funding, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1682, Gebser held that the judicially implied private right of\naction similarly should not impose liability “without regard to\nthe recipient’s knowledge or its corrective actions upon\n\f        MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA 2223\nreceiving notice.” Id. at 289. Monetary damages premised on\nconstructive notice or respondeat superior for sexual harass-\nment, the Court held in Gebser, would entail a risk that “the\nrecipient of funds was unaware of the discrimination.” Id. at\n287. Rather,\n\n       in cases like this one that do not involve official pol-\n       icy of the recipient entity, . . . a damages remedy will\n       not lie under Title IX unless an official who . . . has\n       authority to address the alleged discrimination and to\n       institute corrective measures . . . has actual knowl-\n       edge of discrimination . . . and fails adequately to\n       respond.\n\nId. at 290 (emphasis added).\n\n   [7] Critically for present purposes, Gebser does not make\npre-litigation notice of an alleged violation a prerequisite to\nrecovery in every Title IX case, or even in every sexual\nharassment case. Proof of actual notice is required only when\nthe alleged Title IX violation consists of an institution’s delib-\nerate indifference to acts that “do not involve official policy\nof the recipient entity.” Id. In sexual harassment cases, it is\nthe deliberate failure to curtail known harassment, rather than\nthe harassment itself, that constitutes the intentional Title IX\nviolation.12 See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (1999) (holding that Gebser permits the plain-\ntiff “to hold the Board liable for its own decision to remain\nidle in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its\nschools.”). The Tenth Circuit has held that a corollary of this\nprinciple is that where the official policy is one of deliberate\nindifference to a known overall risk of sexual harassment,\nnotice of a particular harassment situation and an opportunity\n  12\n    The harassment itself may be actionable under state law or 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292.\n\f2224 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY            OF   CALIFORNIA\nto cure it are not predicates for liability. See Simpson v. Univ.\nof Colo.

Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142881\"><a href=\"/opinion/142881/jackson-v-birmingham-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), held that a high school athletics coach\nfired in retaliation for complaining about discrimination in\nathletics funding had a private right of action under Title IX.\nThe Court held that no pre-litigation notice is required in the\nretaliation context. In Gebser and Davis, the Court stated, “we\nemphasized that [the notice] limitation on private damages\nactions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient inten-\ntionally violates the statute.” Id. at 182 (quotation omitted).\nAs retaliation is “easily attributable to the funding recipient\nand it is always — by definition — intentional,” id., the Court\nallowed Jackson’s retaliation claim to proceed without regard\nto whether adequate pre-litigation notice and opportunity to\ncure the violation had been provided.\n\n   [9] Universities’ decisions with respect to athletics are\neven more “easily attributable to the funding recipient and . . .\nalways — by definition — intentional,” id. at 183, than the\nretaliation in Jackson. Institutions, not individual actors,\n   13\n      Simpson concerned two female University of Colorado (CU) students\nsexually assaulted by football players and high school football recruits.\nThe Tenth Circuit held that Gebser’s notice standard did not apply. The\nrecord supported the finding that the head football coach was aware of\n“the serious risk of sexual . . . assault during college-football recruiting\nefforts [and] that such assaults had indeed occurred during CU recruiting\nvisits,” Simpson, 500 F.3d at 1184, and that, although the Boulder District\nAttorney’s office had recommended a policy to curb such assaults after a\nprevious incident involving recruits, the policy was not followed and CU\ncontinued to sponsor an “unsupervised player-host program to show high-\nschool recruits ‘a good time.’ ” Id. The court held this sequence of events\nsatisfied the “official policy” element of Gebser and that a woman\nassaulted thereafter need provide no separate notice and opportunity to\ncure before filing suit.\n\f      MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA 2225\ndecide how to allocate resources between male and female\nathletic teams. Decisions to create or eliminate teams or to\nadd or decrease roster slots for male or female athletes are\nofficial decisions, not practices by individual students or staff.\nAthletic programs that fail effectively to accommodate stu-\ndents of both sexes thus represent “official policy of the recip-\nient entity” and so are not covered by Gebser’s notice\nrequirement. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290.\n\n   Moreover, a judicially imposed notice requirement would\nbe superfluous in light of universities’ ongoing obligations to\ncertify compliance with Title IX’s athletics requirements and\nto track athletics gender equity data. OCR regulations require\nfunding recipients to evaluate their policies and certify, as a\ncondition for receiving funds, that they are “tak[ing] whatever\nremedial action is necessary . . to eliminate . . . discrimina-\ntion.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.4; see also id. § 106.3. UCD and other\nfunding recipients therefore have an affirmative obligation to\nensure compliance with at least one prong of the three-part\neffective accommodation test.\n\n   The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) further\nrequires federally funded universities to report to the Depart-\nment of Education and make available to students the number\nof undergraduates and athletes, broken down by sex, as well\nas sex-segregated data on operating expenses, coach salaries,\nathletic scholarships, recruiting expenditures, and revenues.\n20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). UCD’s EADA reports contain ample\ndata demonstrating that it could not satisfy the substantial pro-\nportionality option and that the trend of increasing female ath-\nletic participation reversed after 2001, indicating that UCD\nmay not have had a continuing practice of program expansion.\nThus, where the alleged harm is unequal provision of athletic\nopportunity, the notice requirement would not supply univer-\nsities with information of which they are legitimately\nunaware. See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 289.\n\n  [10] We conclude for these reasons that pre-litigation\nnotice and opportunity to cure is not necessary in cases alleg-\n\f2226 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA\ning unequal provision of athletic opportunities in violation of\nTitle IX. Applying the notice requirement to institutional\ndecisions would contravene the clear language of Gebser and\nits progeny. It would also be inconsistent with funding recipi-\nents’ affirmative obligations to provide nondiscriminatory\nathletic participation opportunities and continually to assess\nand certify compliance with Title IX.\n\n  The Fifth Circuit has reached the same conclusion we do,\nholding that\n\n    the requirement in the sexual harassment cases —\n    that the academic institution have actual knowledge\n    of the sexual harassment — is not applicable for pur-\n    poses of determining whether an academic institu-\n    tion intentionally discriminated on the basis of sex\n    by denying females equal athletic opportunity. . . . In\n    the instant case, it is the institution itself that is dis-\n    criminating.\n\nPederson, 213 F.3d at 882. The Eighth Circuit, the only other\ncircuit to address the issue, has assumed, without any analy-\nsis, that Gebser’s notice requirement applies equally to Title\nIX cases where plaintiffs allege discrimination in the adminis-\ntration of an athletic program. Grandson v. Univ. of Minn,,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775676\"><a href=\"/opinion/775676/julie-grandson-jennifer-a-thompson-renata-d-lindahl-ginger-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (8th Cir. 2001). But the plaintiffs in\nGrandson did not argue otherwise, id., and the Eighth Circuit\nreached the merits of a later Title IX athletics case without\nmentioning Grandson, Gebser, or the notice requirement. See\nChalenor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777822\"><a href=\"/opinion/777822/eric-chalenor-brady-flatten-chad-lorenson-and-mike-schuster-v-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. It is therefore far from clear that\nGrandson is controlling even in the Eighth Circuit. If it is,\nthen the circuits are already split on the issue, and we find the\nFifth Circuit’s holding (and that of the Tenth Circuit in Simp-\nson, on a different but related issue) the more persuasive, for\nreasons already surveyed.\n\n  [11] We therefore join the Fifth Circuit in holding that\nGebser’s notice requirement is inapplicable to cases alleging\n\f      MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY   OF   CALIFORNIA 2227\nthat a funding recipient has failed effectively to accommodate\nwomen’s interest in athletics. The district court’s decision\ngranting summary judgment on that basis is reversed.\n\n   UCD also moved for summary judgment on the grounds\nthat the record demonstrated “a history and continuing prac-\ntice of program expansion” for women that satisfied Option\nTwo of the three-part test. Although the district court granted\nsummary judgment on the notice grounds discussed above,\nUCD contends that we could, alternatively, affirm the district\ncourt’s decision on the merits. See Atel Fin. Corp. v. Quaker\nCoal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781119\"><a href=\"/opinion/781119/atel-financial-corp-a-california-corporation-v-quaker-coal-company-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926 (9th Cir. 2003). That is so, but\nonly if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nstudents, there are no genuine issues of material fact concern-\ning UCD’s compliance with Option Two. See, e.g., Becerril\nv. Pima County Assessor’s Office, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345252\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345252/becerril-v-pima-county-assessors-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163 (9th\nCir. 2009). On the record before us we cannot affirm on this\nalternative ground.\n\n   [12] In assessing compliance with Option Two, we must,\nunder the Clarification, focus on both the institution’s record\nof adding female participation opportunities and its current\n“plan of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive\nto the developing interests and abilities” of women. “History”\nand “continuing practice” thus constitute two separate inqui-\nries. We conclude that the undisputed facts fall short of dem-\nonstrating UCD’s compliance with either facet of Option\nTwo.\n\n  [13] The Clarification specifies the following factors as\nevidence of an institution’s history of program expansion:\n\n    [A]n institution’s record of adding intercollegiate\n    teams, or upgrading teams to intercollegiate status,\n    for [women]; an institution’s record of increasing the\n    number of participants in intercollegiate athletics\n    who are [women]; and an institution’s affirmative\n\f2228 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\n       responses to requests by students or others for addi-\n       tion or elevation of sports.\n\nThe Option Two analysis focuses primarily, but not exclu-\nsively, on increasing the number of women athletes rather\nthan increasing the number of women’s teams. “OCR will\nassess whether past actions of the institution have expanded\nparticipation opportunities for the underrepresented sex . . .”\n(emphasis added). The number of “participation opportuni-\nties” is defined by the number of female athletes actually\nplaying intercollegiate sports.\n\n   UCD had seven women’s teams in 1970 and added another\nin 1974, thereby increasing the number of female varsity ath-\nletes. The record indicates that UCD did not further expand\nparticipation opportunities for women until 1996. The 1991\nReport of the UCD Title IX Review Committee (Report) indi-\ncated that UCD did not comprehensively review its compli-\nance with Title IX between 1976 and 1991. The Report also\nstated that since 1976, UCD had added two women’s sports\n(soccer and cross country track) but dropped two (golf and\nfield hockey).14 The Report concluded that UCD’s record\n“cannot be termed a demonstrably responsive process of pro-\ngram expansion . . . particularly when female participation\nrelative to male participation has been decreasing over the\npast three years.” Internal UCD memoranda from directors of\nthe athletics program suggest that the numerical participation\ngap continued to grow over the next two years.15\n  14\n      UCD does not dispute that it eliminated field hockey but denies that\nit eliminated a women’s golf team, asserting that UCD “attempted” to start\na women’s golf team in the 1970s that “never got off the ground.” Draw-\ning all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, as we must, we\ncredit UCD’s internal report as accurately describing the elimination of a\nwomen’s golf team.\n   15\n      In 1992 an associate athletic director warned of a “backward slide in\ncompliance,” and in 1993 UCD’s acting athletic director noted that “the\nratio of women participating has decreased slightly in recent years.”\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY         OF   CALIFORNIA 2229\n   In 1995, UCD decided to add three women’s varsity teams.\nThe university reviewed proposals from five women’s club\nteams and elevated water polo, crew and lacrosse to varsity\nstatus. When the three new teams began competing the fol-\nlowing year, the number of female athletes rose from 211 to\n348, with the difference between female enrollment and\nfemale participation in athletics dropping from twenty percent\nto eleven percent.\n\n   UCD represents that it created another women’s varsity\nteam, indoor track, in 1999. The addition of indoor track,\nhowever, cannot be considered evidence of program expan-\nsion. It did nothing to expand the number of female athletes,\nas all the women participating in indoor track also partici-\npated in an existing varsity sport. See Cohen v. Brown Univ.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456044\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456044/cohen-v-brown-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Nonetheless, the number of\nwomen athletes did continue to rise. In the 1999-2000 school\nyear, women varsity athletes at UCD reached a historic high\nin both total numbers and proportion of female athletes to\nenrolled women students.\n\n   Subsequently, however, the number of women playing\nintercollegiate athletics dropped sharply. Meanwhile, in the\nten years since UCD last added a significant number of\nfemale varsity slots, the number of female students at UCD\ngrew by 35%. Rather than keeping pace with this growth in\nwomen’s enrollment, the number of female athletes fluctuated\nbut never regained the apex it reached in 2000.\n\n   [14] In sum, UCD expanded varsity opportunities for\nwomen only between 1996 and 2000. UCD’s elimination of\nwomen from the varsity wrestling team thus took place in the\ncontext of an overall contraction of female athletic participa-\ntion opportunities that began in 2000.16 UCD’s post-2000\n  16\n   As noted, supra note 2, the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient facts\nshowing the existence of female varsity wrestling opportunities to survive\n\f2230 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY           OF   CALIFORNIA\nstrategy for sports equality between the sexes appears to have\nconsisted of reducing varsity athletics overall, and in the pro-\ncess reducing men’s participation more than women’s partici-\npation by using “roster management” to limit the size of\nmen’s teams. The Clarification explicitly precludes consider-\ning such reductions as evidencing program expansion:\n\n     OCR will not find a history and continuing practice\n     of program expansion where an institution increases\n     the proportional participation opportunities for\n     [women] by reducing opportunities for [men] alone\n     or by reducing participation opportunities for [men]\n     to a proportionately greater degree than for [women].\n     . . . [Option Two] considers an institution’s good\n     faith remedial efforts through actual program expan-\n     sion. . . . Cuts in the program for [women], even\n     when coupled with cuts in the program for [men],\n     cannot be considered remedial because they burden\n     members of the sex already disadvantaged by the\n     present program.\n\n  [15] An institution that has eliminated some participation\nopportunities for women can still satisfy Option Two if the\n\nsummary judgment. UCD’s subsequent decision to permit women to com-\npete against men for a slot on the team does not affect our analysis. By\nrequiring women to prevail against men, the university changed the condi-\ntions under which women could participate in varsity wrestling in a man-\nner that foreseeably precluded their future participation.\n   UCD’s contention that it “ha[d] not declared wrestling to be a contact\nsport” does not advance its position. First, wrestling is a contact sport\nunder OCR regulations. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b). While women must be per-\nmitted to try out for all-male teams if there is no women’s team in that\nsport, this requirement is waived for contact sports. Id. But the contact-\nsport “exemption did not give [UCD] license to discriminate against [the\nplaintiffs] because of their sex once [UCD] decided to allow [them] to join\nthe team.” Mercer v. Duke Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789583\"><a href=\"/opinion/789583/heather-sue-mercer-v-duke-university-and-fred-goldsmith/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (4th Cir. 2005) (cita-\ntion omitted).\n\f        MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY       OF   CALIFORNIA 2231\nelimination is offset by a strong history of program expansion.\nIn UCD’s case, however, the elimination of women’s wres-\ntling opportunities occurred in the context of a women’s ath-\nletics program that was, at best, stagnant. We therefore hold\nthat UCD has not had a history of program expansion for\nwomen and so did not satisfy Option Two through such a his-\ntory.\n\n  The 1996 Clarification lists two factors that may indicate a\ncontinuing practice of program expansion:\n\n       [A]n institution’s current implementation of a non-\n       discriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the\n       addition of sports (including the elevation of club or\n       intramural teams) and the effective communication\n       of the policy or procedure to students; and an institu-\n       tion’s current implementation of a plan of program\n       expansion that is responsive to developing interests\n       and abilities.\n\n   The record contains undisputed evidence that UCD has a\nprocedure for requesting additional varsity sports and effec-\ntively communicates that procedure to students. According to\nthe procedure distributed to students, the “primary factor” in\nUCD’s evaluation of proposals to create new varsity teams is\nthe “[o]verall impact on intercollegiate program gender equi-\nty.” In 2003, UCD received detailed applications from mem-\nbers of four women’s club sports (bowling, horse polo, field\nhockey, and rugby) seeking elevation to varsity status. These\napplications indicate that students are aware of the opportu-\nnity to request new varsity athletic opportunities.17\n  17\n    UCD points to its Title IX Compliance Officer and grievance proce-\ndure as evidence of a practice of program expansion. As both are required\nby OCR regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 106.8, and neither affects the number of\nfemale athletes or teams, they do not indicate program expansion for pur-\nposes of Option Two.\n\f2232 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY      OF   CALIFORNIA\n   The 2003 application was the field hockey club team’s sec-\nond attempt to regain varsity status. An earlier application\nwas rejected in 1995. At that time, the Title IX Advisory\nCommittee advocated elevating lacrosse rather than field\nhockey to varsity status but noted that field hockey had “de-\nveloped strong interest from students” and was “a relatively\nstrong NCAA sport,” with three Division I teams competing\nat nearby universities. The committee recommended that\n“[s]hould gender equity not be achieved by the addition of the\nthree sports proposed, and funding be available in the future,\nfield hockey would be considered a prime candidate for addi-\ntion to the ICA program in the future.”\n\n   When field hockey club players applied for varsity status in\n2003, however, their application was again denied. In fact,\nUCD rejected all four club team applications, even though all\napplicants were evaluated as “successful” and “active” club\nteams with “a long tradition of participation.” Instead, UCD\ndecided to create a women’s golf team at the behest of the\nmen’s golf coach.\n\n   UCD contends that the fact that golf was proposed by the\nmen’s golf coach rather than female students is irrelevant. We\ndisagree. Universities are free to consider applications from\nindividuals other than students, and it is appropriate to evalu-\nate interest at the high school level as well as among current\nUCD students. A funding recipient can only satisfy Option\nTwo, however, by showing an expansion of participation\nopportunities that is “demonstrably responsive to [women’s]\ndeveloping interests and abilities . . . includ[ing] interests that\nalready exist at the institution.” The fact that there were no\nwomen currently attending UCD who were interested enough\nin golf to participate at the club level or to request varsity sta-\ntus suggests that the addition of golf instead of field hockey,\nbowling, horse polo or rugby was not “demonstratively\nresponsive” to the interests of current female students.\n\f       MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY     OF   CALIFORNIA 2233\n   Moreover, UCD’s selection of golf, which added only\nseven participation opportunities for women, was at odds with\nits stated priority of taking a significant step toward overall\ngender equity. Elevating horse polo, rugby or field hockey\nwould have added far more female varsity athletes.18\n\n   We recognize that budgetary constraints often prevent uni-\nversities from creating new teams and adding varsity slots.\nBut “Title IX does not require that a school pour ever-\nincreasing sums into its athletic establishment.” Cohen v.\nBrown Univ., 991 F.2d at 898-99 n.15. Universities may\nachieve compliance by reducing men’s athletic slots until par-\nticipation rates become substantially proportionate to the\nundergraduate population. Id.; Neal, 198 F.3d at 771; Kelley,\n35 F.3d at 270; Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830. They may not, how-\never, maintain varsity teams for male students while denying\nfemale students comparable “opportunities to enjoy the thrill\nof victory, the agony of defeat, and the many tangible benefits\nthat flow from just being given a chance to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics.” Neal, 198 F.3d at 773.\n\n   [16] UCD took a significant step towards Title IX compli-\nance by adding three women’s teams in 1996, but Option Two\nrequires more than a single step. It requires evidence of con-\ntinuous progress toward the mandate of gender equality that\nTitle IX has imposed on funding recipients for the past thirty\nyears. The record before us does not contain undisputed facts\nshowing a history and continuing practice of program expan-\nsion that is responsive to women’s interests.\n\n   [17] We conclude that the grant of summary judgment to\nUCD cannot be affirmed on the alternative merits ground that\nUCD complies with Title IX’s requirement of providing equal\nathletic opportunities to students of both sexes.\n  18\n    UCD’s review committee estimated that field hockey would add 22\nfemale athletes; horse polo, 35; rugby, 30 to 40. Bowling would have\nadded 12 to 15.\n\f2234 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY    OF   CALIFORNIA\n   The students also sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that\nUCD violates the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining an\nathletics program that discriminates on the basis of gender.\nThe district court dismissed the claim because it determined\nthat “Title IX’s enforcement scheme is sufficiently compre-\nhensive to . . . demonstrate that Congress intended to preclude\n§ 1983 claims when it enacted this statute.”\n\n   [18] Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145917\"><a href=\"/opinion/145917/fitzgerald-v-barnstable-school-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As in Fitzgerald, the plaintiffs here invoke § 1983 to\nseek damages for violations of constitutional rights. See id. at\n796-97 (explaining distinctions between the rights created by\nTitle IX and those afforded by the Equal Protection Clause).\n\n   The defendants concede that the district court ruling does\nnot survive Fitzgerald but urge us to affirm dismissal of the\n§ 1983 claim on other grounds. We decline to do so, for rea-\nsons we now explain.\n\n   UCD first contends that the § 1983 claim for damages is\nprecluded by the statute of limitations and that the district\ncourt did not address this argument. In fact, the district court\nconsidered and rejected the statute of limitations defense as to\nboth the Title IX effective accommodation and § 1983 equal\nprotection claims in response to UCD’s original motion to\ndismiss. The court held that because the students claimed that\nthey were “currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly\nsex discriminatory practices . . . their claims accrue each and\nevery day they are denied equal access to athletic participa-\ntion.”\n\n  [19] The district court was quite correct. Section 1983 “is\npresumptively available to remedy a state’s ongoing violation\nof federal law.” AlohaCare v. Haw.

As the plaintiffs were students and there-\nfore subject to the policy that allegedly discriminated on the\nbasis of sex at the time they filed their complaint, their § 1983\nclaim is not time-barred.\n\n   [20] UCD next urges this court to conclude that the § 1983\nclaim against the individual defendants is precluded by the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity. The defendants, however, did\nnot raise a qualified immunity defense in any of their disposi-\ntive motions before the district court.20 Our discretion to\naffirm on grounds other than those relied on by the district\ncourt extends to issues raised in a manner providing the dis-\ntrict court an opportunity to rule on it.

As the district court has had no\nopportunity to rule on the individual defendants’ qualified\nimmunity defense, we will not affirm on that basis.

The district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the\nTitle IX claim is reversed.
