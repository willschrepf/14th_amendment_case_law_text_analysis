The Central Intelligence Agency arranged for the filmmakers to meet\n\nwith four of its officers who played a role in planning the raid. A Department of Defense official\n\noffered to introduce them to a U.S. Navy SEAL who was also involved in the planning. The\n\nfilmmakers were told the full name of the Navy SEAL, and the first names of the CIA officers.\n\n       Judicial Watch, a non-profit organization that promotes government accountability,\n\nsubmitted a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request for all records of CIA and\n\nDepartment of Defense communications with the filmmakers. The agencies produced most of\n\nthose records, some of which were redacted in places, and withheld others, primarily on the\n\ngrounds of attorney-client privilege. Judicial Watch does not challenge the withholdings. The\n\nonly redactions that it challenges are the names of the SEAL and the CIA officers.\n\n       Judicial Watch concedes that the names of those individuals would normally be exempt\n\nfrom disclosure. But the organization argues that the government placed their names in the\n\fpublic domain by revealing them to the filmmakers, and now must provide that information to\n\nanyone who requests it. Under the law of this circuit, a FOIA requester who would prevail on\n\nthat argument must identify “specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being\n\nwithheld.” Public Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Judicial Watch\n\ncannot do so, because the general public does not know the names that the organization would\n\nuncover here. Because the government has withheld the names pursuant to a concededly valid\n\nFOIA exemption and has not placed them in the public domain, its motion for summary\n\njudgment will be granted.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In August 2011, Judicial Watch sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the Central\n\nIntelligence Agency and the Department of Defense, seeking all records of communications with\n\nKathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, respectively the director and screenwriter of “an upcoming\n\nfilm . . . tentatively titled, ‘Killing bin Laden.’” Judicial Watch also requested all records of\n\ncommunications with “Megan Ellison and/or any other officer or employee of Annapurna\n\nPictures, the financiers of the film” and “all records concerning, regarding or related to the\n\nupcoming film” itself. The time frame for the request was January 1, 2011 through August 9,\n\n2011. Decl. of Martha M. Lutz, Information Review Officer, Director’s Area, Central\n\nIntelligence Agency (Sept. 14, 2012) (“Lutz Decl.”), Ex. A (FOIA Request from Judicial Watch\n\n(Aug. 9, 2011)), at 1; Decl. of Mark H. Herrington, Associate Deputy General Counsel,\n\nDepartment of Defense (Sept. 14, 2012) (“Herrington Decl.”), Ex. A (FOIA Request from\n\nJudicial Watch (Aug. 9, 2011)), at 1. Both agencies replied that they would be unable to respond\n\nto the request within twenty days, as FOIA requires. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6); Lutz Decl., Ex. B\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f(Letter from Susan Viscuso, Information and Privacy Coordinator, CIA (Aug. 16, 2011));\n\nHerrington Decl., Ex. B (Letter from Paul J. Jacobsmeyer, Chief, Office of Freedom of\n\nInformation, Department of Defense (Aug. 22, 2011)).\n\n       Judicial Watch filed this suit in January 2012. In May of that year, the Department of\n\nDefense produced 153 pages of responsive records, Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4, while the CIA\n\nproduced sixty-seven responsive documents and withheld twenty-seven, primarily on the\n\ngrounds of attorney-client privilege, Lutz Decl. at ¶ 9. Both agencies produced additional\n\nresponsive records that August. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4; Lutz Decl. at ¶ 9.\n\n       A sixteen-page transcript of a background interview with Kathryn Bigelow and Mark\n\nBoal (collectively, “the filmmakers”) was among the documents that the Department of Defense\n\nproduced. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4. Names mentioned by either Mark Boal or Michael Vickers,\n\nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, were redacted from five places in the transcript.\n\nThe first three redactions occurred in the following exchange:\n\n       Mark Boal: I’ll take [NAME REDACTED] or someone like that.\n\n       Michael Vickers: Well the basic idea is they’ll make a guy available who was\n       involved from the beginning as a planner; a SEAL Team 6 Operator and\n       Commander.\n\n       Mark Boal: Are you talking about [NAME REDACTED]?\n\n       Michael Vickers: A guy name[d] [NAME REDACTED]. And so, he basically can\n       probably give you everything you would want or would get from Adm[.] Olson or\n       Adm[.] McRaven.\n\nId., Ex. C (Transcript of Background Interview (July 15, 2011)) (“Background Interview”), page\n\nnumbered DoD 140. The redacted names are, in order of appearance, (1) the first and last name\n\nof a member of the Department of Defense, (2) the rank and last name of another member of the\n\n\n                                                3\n\fDepartment of Defense, and (3) the last name followed by the full name—as in “Smith, John\n\nSmith”—of a third member of the Department of Defense. Id. at ¶ 7. After the filmmakers\n\nexpressed their pleasure at this arrangement, Under Secretary Vickers went on:\n\n       And so, he’ll speak for operators and he’ll speak for senior military commanders,\n       because the[y’re] all the same tribe and everything, and so you should get most of\n       what you need from him. Now, again the reason Adm[.] Olson and Adm[.]\n       McRaven didn’t want to talk is this command conflict of interest. And then with\n       [NAME REDACTED] the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any\n       way as a consultant, because again, it’s the same thing, he shouldn’t be talking out\n       of school, this at least, this gives him one step removed and he knows what he can\n       and can’t say, but this way at least he can be as open as he can with you and it ought\n       to meet your needs and give you lots of color.\n\nBackground Interview, page numbered DoD 140. At the end of the interview, Under Secretary\n\nVickers asked “So should I have [NAME REDACTED] reach out to you?” Id., page numbered\n\nDoD 153. These redactions are, respectively, the last name of the individual that he mentioned\n\nearlier, and the rank and last name of that same person. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 7. The three\n\nindividuals whose names have been redacted were all assigned to routinely deployable units. Id.\n\n       Among the documents produced by the Central Intelligence Agency were two internal\n\nemail chains that contained the names of undercover CIA officers who played a role in planning\n\nthe Bin Laden operation and later met with the filmmakers. Lutz Decl. at ¶¶ 12, 14–15. The\n\nfirst and last name of one such officer was redacted from the first email chain, and the first\n\nnames of that officer and three others were redacted from the second chain. Id. at ¶¶ 14–15. The\n\nCIA explains that “when the meetings with the filmmakers took place at the CIA Headquarters,\n\nthe guidance provided to the officers who were . . . in sensitive positions was that they should\n\nprovide the filmmakers with their true first names only.” Id. at ¶ 12; see also id. at ¶ 14 (“To my\n\nknowledge, the only redacted information in this email that may have been shared with the\n\n\n                                                 4\n\ffilmmakers during the meetings was the first name of one of the officers who is in the email\n\nchain’s distribution line. This email also contains that officer’s last name, but . . . it is my\n\nunderstanding that the officer was instructed not to provide his last name to the filmmakers.”);\n\nid. at ¶ 15 (“The redacted information in these two paragraphs reflects the true first names of\n\nfour CIA officers who met with the filmmakers. . . . As noted above, it is my understanding that\n\nthese officers’ true first names most likely would have been shared with the filmmakers during\n\nthe meetings.”).\n\n        Judicial Watch now challenges the government’s authority to withhold the full name and\n\nrank of the Navy SEAL mentioned by Under Secretary Vickers and the first names of the four\n\nCIA officers who met with the filmmakers. See Pl.’s Br. at 6. The parties have filed cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the question.\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        A. The Freedom of Information Act\n\n        FOIA was enacted so that citizens could discover “what their government is up to.” U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989). “The\n\nbasic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic\n\nsociety, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the\n\ngoverned.” NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978). FOIA therefore\n\n“seeks to permit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view and\n\nattempts to create a judicially enforceable public right to secure such information from possibly\n\nunwilling official hands.” Dep’t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976) (quoting\n\nEPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 80 (1973)). FOIA “is broadly conceived,” Mink, 410 U.S. at 80, and\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fits “dominant objective” is “disclosure, not secrecy,” U.S. Dep’t of Def. v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487,\n\n494 (1994) (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 361).\n\n       An agency may withhold information responsive to a FOIA request only if the\n\ninformation falls within an enumerated statutory exemption. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). These\n\n“exemptions are ‘explicitly exclusive,’” U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151\n\n(1989) (quoting FAA Adm’r v. Robertson, 422 U.S. 255, 262 (1975)), and “have been\n\nconsistently given a narrow compass,” id. “The agency bears the burden of justifying any\n\nwithholding, and the Court reviews the agency claims of exemption de novo.” Bigwood v. U.S.\n\nAgency for Int’l Dev., 484 F. Supp. 2d 68, 74 (D.D.C. 2007) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)).\n\nBecause the focus of FOIA is “information, not documents . . . an agency cannot justify\n\nwithholding an entire document simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.”\n\nKrikorian v. Dep’t of State, 984 F.2d 461, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Instead, FOIA requires that federal agencies provide to a requester all\n\nnon-exempt information that is “reasonably segregable” from, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)—that is, not\n\n“inextricably intertwined with,” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242,\n\n260 (D.C. Cir. 1977)—exempt information.\n\n       B. Summary Judgment\n\n       FOIA cases are typically and appropriately decided on motions for summary judgment.\n\nMiscavige v. IRS, 2 F.3d 366, 368 (11th Cir. 1993); Defenders of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol,\n\n623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2009); Rushford v. Civiletti, 485 F. Supp. 477, 481 n.13 (D.D.C.\n\n1980). A motion for summary judgment should be granted only “if the movant shows that there\n\nis no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\n\n                                                6\n\flaw.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A material fact is one that “might affect the outcome of the suit\n\nunder the governing law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The\n\nmovant must support its factual positions by “citing to particular parts of materials in the record,\n\nincluding depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations,\n\nstipulations . . . , admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.” FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n56(c)(1)(A); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). Factual assertions in the\n\nmoving party’s affidavits or declarations may be accepted as true unless the opposing party\n\nsubmits its own affidavits, declarations, or documentary evidence to the contrary. Neal v. Kelly,\n\n963 F.2d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n         In a FOIA case, an agency is entitled to summary judgment if it can demonstrate that\n\nthere are no material facts in dispute as to the adequacy of its search for or production of\n\nresponsive records. Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 849 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 13, 21 (D.D.C. 2012). An agency must show that any responsive information it has\n\nwithheld was either exempt from disclosure under one of the exemptions enumerated in 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b), or else “inextricably intertwined with” exempt information, Mead Data, 566 F.2d at\n\n260. “Because FOIA challenges necessarily involve situations in which one party (the\n\ngovernment) has sole access to the relevant information, and that same party bears the burden of\n\njustifying its disclosure decisions, the courts . . . require the government to provide as detailed a\n\ndescription as possible—without, of course, disclosing the privileged material itself—of the\n\nmaterial it refuses to disclose.” Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 79 F.3d 1172, 1178 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       This justification is typically contained in a declaration or affidavit, referred to as a\n\n“Vaughn index” after the case of Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). An agency’s\n\naffidavits or declarations are presumed to be submitted in good faith. See SafeCard Servs., Inc.\n\nv. S.E.C., 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991). There is no set formula for a Vaughn index,\n\nbecause “the critical elements of the Vaughn index lie in its function, and not its form.” Kay v.\n\nFCC, 976 F. Supp. 23, 35 (D.D.C. 1997). The purpose of a Vaughn index is “to permit adequate\n\nadversary testing of the agency’s claimed right to an exemption,” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v.\n\nU.S. Customs Serv., 802 F.2d 525, 527 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing Mead Data, 566 F.2d at 251),\n\nand so the index must contain “an adequate description of the records” and “a plain statement of\n\nthe exemptions relied upon to withhold each record,” id. at 527 n.9.\n\n                                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n       Judicial Watch concedes that both the first names of the four CIA officers who met with\n\nthe filmmakers and the full name and rank of the Navy SEAL mentioned by Under Secretary\n\nVickers would normally be exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 3, which authorizes\n\nthe withholding of matters “specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(3); see 10 U.S.C. § 130b(a) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to withhold\n\n“personally identifying information regarding (1) any member of the armed forces assigned to\n\n. . . a routinely deployable unit”); 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (exempting the Central Intelligence Agency\n\nfrom “the provisions of any . . . law which require[s] the publication or disclosure of the . . .\n\nnames . . . of personnel employed by the Agency”). But Judicial Watch argues that the\n\ngovernment released those names into the public domain by sharing them with the filmmakers\n\nand now must disclose them to any FOIA requester. See Pl.’s Br. at 7–8.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       “This circuit has held that the government may not rely on an otherwise valid exemption\n\nto justify withholding information that is already in the ‘public domain.’” Students Against\n\nGenocide v. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 836 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The logic of the public domain\n\ndoctrine is that “where information requested ‘is truly public, then enforcement of an exemption\n\ncannot fulfill its purposes.’” Cottone v. Reno, 193 F.3d 550, 554 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting\n\nNiagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 169 F.3d 16, 19 (D.C. Cir. 1999));\n\naccord Prison Legal News v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 628 F.3d 1243, 1253 (10th Cir.\n\n2011) (“The public domain doctrine is limited and applies only when the applicable exemption\n\ncan no longer serve its purpose.”). But before a court can find that the enforcement of an\n\notherwise valid exemption would be pointless, it “must be confident that the information sought\n\nis truly public and that the requester [will] receive no more than what is publicly available.”\n\nStudents Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555). The D.C.\n\nCircuit has therefore held that “[f]or the public domain doctrine to apply, the specific\n\ninformation sought must have already been ‘disclosed and preserved in a permanent public\n\nrecord.’” Id. (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554); accord Davis v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 968 F.2d\n\n1276, 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussing the plaintiff’s obligation to show “that the information\n\nhe seeks has entered and remains in the public domain” (emphasis added)).\n\n       Because the public domain doctrine is a doctrine of futility, triggered only when it would\n\nserve no purpose to enforce an exemption, it is of almost no use to a plaintiff attempting to learn\n\nsomething that it does not already know. “[A]s a practical matter,” successfully invoking the\n\ndoctrine “yields the FOIA plaintiff little new information.” Assassination Archives & Research\n\nCtr. v. CIA, 334 F.3d 55, 60 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In fact, the doctrine is “a little odd: if the\n\n\n                                                  9\n\finformation is publicly available, one wonders, why is [anyone] burning up counsel fees to\n\nobtain it under FOIA?” Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19; accord Davis, 968 F.2d at 1279–80\n\n(“The [Supreme] Court [has] strongly suggested that a public domain rule such as ours is of little\n\nsignificance, because if a requester can establish that the information he seeks is ‘“freely\n\navailable,” there would be no reason to invoke the FOIA to obtain access to the information.’”\n\n(quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 764\n\n(1989))).\n\n       But a FOIA requester is nonetheless free to press the point. To do so successfully, it\n\nmust identify “specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being withheld.”\n\nPublic Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citing Afshar v. Dep’t of\n\nState, 702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). The burden of production is allocated in this way\n\nbecause “were it otherwise, the government would face the daunting task of proving a negative:\n\nthat requested information had not been previously disclosed.” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554; accord\n\nNiagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19; Davis, 968 F.2d at 1279.\n\n       Judicial Watch claims that the five redacted names at issue here are in the public domain,\n\nbut has not “point[ed] to specific information . . . that duplicates that being withheld,” Public\n\nCitizen, 11 F.3d at 201, much less a “permanent public record” in which those names have been\n\n“disclosed and preserved,” Students Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193\n\nF.3d at 554). In short, Judicial Watch does not know—and, outside of this suit, apparently has\n\nno way of learning—the names of these individuals. That fact is strong evidence that those\n\nnames are not in the public domain. See Pls.’ Reply at 2 (arguing that the court should order the\n\nnames released because the public would benefit from the disclosure).\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       It is worth noting, however, that the D.C. Circuit has not “establish[ed] a uniform,\n\ninflexible rule requiring every public-domain claim to be substantiated with a hard copy\n\nsimulacrum of the sought-after material.” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555. (To do so would be “empty\n\nformalism,” that court has said. Id.) There may not be much flexibility in the public domain\n\ndoctrine—but there is some, as Cottone v. Reno demonstrated. In that case, a FOIA requester\n\nsought copies of surreptitiously recorded conversations that had been played at his trial. The\n\ncourt reporter had identified each recording as it was played, but had not transcribed their\n\ncontents. Reasoning from cases holding that “the common law right to inspect and copy judicial\n\nrecords is indisputable” and “extends to records which are not in written form, such as audio and\n\nvideo tapes,” In re Nat’l Broad. Co., 653 F.2d 609, 612 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (footnotes omitted), the\n\nCottone court observed that the FOIA requester “ha[d] demonstrated precisely which recorded\n\nconversations were played in open court,” and concluded that he had therefore “discharged his\n\nburden of production by pointing to specific tapes which, having been played in open court and\n\nreceived into evidence, reside in the public domain and mirror precisely the information that he\n\nhas requested,” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555.\n\n       Cottone holds that information is in the public domain for the purposes of a FOIA request\n\nif some other source of law provides a right to access the information. In that (admittedly\n\nlimited) case, a FOIA requester who seeks information he does not possess can still meet “his\n\n‘burden of showing that there is permanent public record of the exact [information] he wishes,’”\n\nid. at 554 (quoting Davis, 968 F.2d at 1280 (emphasis added in Cottone), by pointing to his right\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fof access to the very information being withheld.1 “[V]ery often . . . some type of hard copy\n\nfacsimile will be the only practicable way for a FOIA requester to demonstrate that the specific\n\ninformation he has solicited has indeed circulated into the public domain,” id. at 555; see also\n\nDavis, 968 F.2d at 1280, but “often” is not “always.”\n\n       In a similar vein, the D.C. Circuit has entertained the argument that there may be “slight\n\nvariation[s]” on the public domain doctrine. Students Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836\n\n(quoting party’s brief). In Students Against Genocide, an organization seeking reconnaissance\n\nphotographs (which reportedly showed evidence of an atrocity committed by Bosnian Serbs in\n\nthe town of Srebrenica) contended that then-Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine\n\nAlbright had “waived the government’s right to invoke . . . FOIA exemptions by displaying the\n\nwithheld photographs to the delegates of the foreign governments that are members of the [U.N.]\n\nSecurity Council.” Id. The court quickly disposed of the organization’s argument from the\n\npublic domain doctrine, explaining that:\n\n       The photographs in question here plainly do not fall within that doctrine. They were\n       not released to the general public; only the Security Council delegates saw them. In\n       fact, the photographs were not “released” at all. Although Ambassador Albright\n       displayed them to the delegates, she retained custody, and none left the U.N.\n\n\n\n       1\n           Presumably, information is only in the public domain under Cottone if the right to\naccess it could be successfully invoked. For instance, “the right to inspect and copy judicial\nrecords,” Nat’l Broad. Co., 653 F.2d at 613—though “indisputable,” id. at 612—is “not\nabsolute,” id. at 613. Access to those records can be denied if the district court concludes that\njustice so requires. Id.; accord United States v. Mitchell, 551 F.2d 1252, 1260 (D.C. Cir. 1976),\nrev’d on other grounds sub nom. Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589 (1978). If a\ndistrict court had refused to allow the copying of the recordings sought in Cottone (and had not\nabused its discretion in doing so) then the fact that they had been played at trial presumably\nwould not have availed the FOIA requester. The question of how a court hearing a FOIA case\nshould assess whether the copying of trial records would have been (or should be) permitted was\nnot addressed by Cottone and need not be discussed here.\n\n                                                12\n\f        chamber. Hence there is no “permanent public record” of the photographs. See\n        Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554.\n\nId. (citation omitted).\n\n        The court then considered the “slight variation” on the public domain doctrine offered by\n\nthe organization, which contended that “by disclosing the photographs to the members of the\n\nSecurity Council, the government . . . let ‘the cat . . . out of the bag,’ and whatever damage\n\ndisclosure might do has already been done.” Id. (quoting party’s brief) (second ellipses in\n\noriginal). This argument sprang from the logic behind the public domain doctrine—that, “where\n\ninformation requested ‘is truly public . . . enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its\n\npurposes,’” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19)—rather than its\n\nformal insistence that a disclosure be memorialized in a “permanent public record,” see Cottone,\n\n193 F.3d at 554; Davis, 968 F.2d at 1280.\n\n        The Students Against Genocide court addressed the argument from principle on its own\n\nterms, rather than simply enforcing the formal requirement. It rejected the contention that,\n\nhaving shown the photographs to foreigners, the government was obliged to provide them to\n\nAmericans, assuming instead that “if the requested photographs are released, they will eventually\n\nmake their way to foreign governments” which had not previously seen them. Students Against\n\nGenocide, 257 F.3d at 837. The court credited the assertion that the United States “may have\n\naffirmative foreign policy reasons for sharing sensitive information with some foreign\n\ngovernments and not with others,” and found it “significant that Ambassador Albright displayed,\n\nbut did not distribute, the photographs in question,” which prevented “professional imagery\n\nanalysts” from “mak[ing] detailed examinations” that might reveal the “technical capabilities of\n\n[U.S.] reconnaissance systems.” Id. The court therefore concluded that the cat was not out of\n\n                                                 13\n\fthe bag at all: the release of the photographs could harm national interests by allowing foreign\n\ngovernments which had not seen the images to do so, and could moreover facilitate attempts to\n\nlearn the technical capabilities of American reconnaissance systems. Because the withholding of\n\nthe photographs continued to serve a valid purpose, the court enforced the applicable FOIA\n\nexemptions. Id.\n\n       If Cottone holds that FOIA requesters may, on rare occasions, use the public domain\n\ndoctrine to gain information that they do not possess, Students Against Genocide suggests that\n\nthe principle motivating that doctrine—that “where information requested ‘is truly public . . .\n\nenforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes,’” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting\n\nNiagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19)—may have implications beyond the simple rule that the\n\ngovernment must release information that has been “disclosed and preserved in a permanent\n\npublic record,” Students Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554).\n\nThis is not certain—the opinion also says that “[f]or the public domain doctrine to apply, the\n\nspecific information sought must have already been ‘disclosed and preserved in a permanent\n\npublic record,’” id. (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554) (emphasis added))—but the court’s\n\nwillingness to entertain the argument holds the possibility open.\n\n       Not that either case does Judicial Watch much good. That organization has not, per\n\nCottone, identified any non-FOIA right to the names at issue here. Arguing from the slender\n\nopening in Students Against Genocide, Judicial Watch encourages the court to adopt the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s holding that although “the ‘public domain’ test articulated by the D.C. Circuit is one\n\npersuasive way of determining when the government has waived [an exemption] under FOIA, it\n\nshould not be the only test for government waiver.” Watkins v. U.S. Bureau of Customs &\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fBorder Prot., 643 F.3d 1189, 1197 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). The additional test\n\npropounded by Watkins holds that when the government has made “a no-strings-attached\n\ndisclosure of . . . confidential information to a private third party” it has waived its ability to\n\nwithhold that information under FOIA, whether or not “the disclosure was . . . preserved in a\n\n‘permanent public record.’” Id.; see also id. at 1198 (“[W]hen an agency freely discloses to a\n\nthird party confidential information covered by a FOIA exemption without limiting the third\n\nparty’s ability to further disseminate the information then the agency waives the ability to claim\n\nan exemption to a FOIA request for the disclosed information.”).2\n\n        Judicial Watch reasons that the disclosures to the filmmakers were made with “no strings\n\nattached,” see id. at 1197—that is,“without limiting the [filmmakers’] ability to further\n\ndisseminate the information,” id. at 1198—and that, under Watkins, the government has\n\ntherefore waived its ability to assert Exemption 3. Even if that description of the disclosures\n\nwere accurate (and it may not be: when Under Secretary Vickers mentioned the Navy SEAL, he\n\nemphasized that “the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way,” Background\n\nInterview, page numbered DoD 140) it would not be enough to establish waiver in this circuit.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has been clear that the enforcement of an otherwise applicable exemption is\n\nonly pointless when the withheld information is “truly public,” Students Against Genocide, 257\n\nF.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555); Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19, when it “has\n\nentered and remains in the public domain,” Davis, 968 F.2d at 1279 (emphasis added). If the\n\nfilmmakers had publicized the names that they learned and the government now seeks to\n\n        2\n          As a dissenting judge acknowledged, the Watkins test is at odds with the precedents of\nthis circuit. Watkins, 643 F.3d at 1199 (Rymer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“I\npart company only with respect to whether we should adopt the ‘public domain’ test for waiver\nembraced by the D.C. Circuit . . . . I think we should.”).\n\n                                                  15\n\fwithhold, this would be a much harder case, one that might turn on the question of whether those\n\nnames had been “officially acknowledged.” See Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990). But this is not that case. The names have not been “released to the general public,”\n\nStudents Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836, and Judicial Watch cannot meet its “initial burden\n\nof pointing to specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being withheld.”\n\nPublic Citizen, 11 F.3d at 201; accord Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1130.3\n\n       Because Judicial Watch cannot do so, it makes one more effort to amend the public\n\ndomain doctrine. The organization suggests that official disclosures have been held not to place\n\ninformation in the public domain when they were made for an important governmental purpose.\n\nFrom this premise, Judicial Watch appears to conclude that because the disclosures at issue here\n\nwere made to assist in the production of a film and not (it says) for any important purpose, they\n\n(unlike the others) put information into the public domain. The first problem with this argument\n\nis that it is irreconcilable with the doctrine discussed above. Judicial Watch would apparently\n\nrecast its burden of production as an obligation to either “point[] to specific information in the\n\n\n\n       3\n           McKinley v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 849 F. Supp. 2d 47\n(D.D.C. 2012), is not to the contrary. After summarizing the Board of Governors’ argument on a\nquestion of waiver—the Board “maintain[ed] that . . . publication [of certain records on the\nwebsite of a congressional committee did] not waive the Board’s FOIA exemptions because the\nrecords were provided to the [committee] under a written confidentiality agreement that did not\nauthorize public disclosure”—the McKinley court held that “[d]isclosures to Congress are not\nofficial disclosures within the meaning of FOIA and do not waive an agency’s FOIA\nExemptions,” and neither does “the mere fact that the committee subsequently, and without\nauthorization, published the records.” Id. at 60. The holding rested on who made the disclosure,\nand whether it was authorized: if the Board had made an official disclosure within the meaning\nof FOIA or if it had authorized a third party to make such a disclosure, then it would have\nwaived its exemptions. Judicial Watch advocates the inverse rule: that unless an agency forbids\na third party from disclosing information, then it has waived its exemptions, regardless of\nwhether the third party actually discloses that information. For the reasons discussed above, that\nposition cannot survive an encounter with the law of this circuit.\n\n                                                 16\n\fpublic domain that duplicates that being withheld” or identify a disclosure that, although not\n\npublicly documented, was made for an unimportant reason. As should by now be obvious, that\n\nis not the law of this circuit.\n\n        And if that were not enough, the second problem with this argument is that it misreads\n\nthe cases on which it relies. Students Against Genocide did not add some “governmental\n\npurpose” element to the public domain doctrine, but (as discussed above) simply reaffirmed its\n\nroots in the principle that when “enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes,” there\n\nis no point in enforcing it. Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19).\n\n        In Muslim Advocates v. United States Department of Justice, a court in this district held\n\nthat the Federal Bureau of Investigation had not placed certain chapters of its Domestic\n\nInvestigations and Operations Guide into the public domain when it showed them to a handful of\n\ncivil rights and civil liberties groups. Reasoning from Students Against Genocide, the court\n\nnoted that “the disputed chapters were not released to the general public,” 833 F. Supp. 2d 92,\n\n100 (D.D.C. 2011), and had not “circulated into the public domain,” id. at 101 (quoting Cottone,\n\n193 F.3d at 555). In a footnote rejecting the argument that the public domain doctrine applied\n\ndifferently in the cases of Exemptions 1 and 7(E), the Muslim Advocates court took account of\n\nthe “circumstances of prior disclosure”—described above—but not its purposes. Id. at 102 n.8\n\n(quoting Carson v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 631 F.2d 1008, 1015 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). Neither of\n\nthese cases stands for the proposition that disclosures made for an insufficiently important\n\ngovernmental purpose necessarily put information into the public domain.4\n\n        4\n         Because the court concludes that the names at issue here were properly withheld\npursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, it need not consider the government’s argument that the\nwithholding was also proper under Exemption 6. See Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 762 n.12\n(“Because Exemption 7(C) covers this case, there is no occasion to address the application of\n\n                                                17\n\f                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Although it touches upon matters of considerable public concern, this case presents an\n\nexceedingly narrow question: whether a FOIA requester that knows information has been\n\ndisclosed to a private party is necessarily entitled to that same disclosure. Under the law of this\n\ncircuit, the answer to that question is “No.” Otherwise exempt information does not enter the\n\npublic domain unless it becomes “truly public,” which the names at issue here have not.\n\nBecause the plaintiff has not carried its “burden of pointing to specific information in the public\n\ndomain that duplicates that being withheld,” the government’s motion for summary judgment\n\nwill be granted.\n\n                                                              Rudolph Contreras\n                                                              United States District Judge\n\n       Date: August 28, 2013\n\n\n\n\nExemption 6.”).\n\n                                                 18\n\f",

The Central Intelligence Agency arranged for the filmmakers to meet\n\nwith four of its officers who played a role in planning the raid. A Department of Defense official\n\noffered to introduce them to a U.S. Navy SEAL who was also involved in the planning. The\n\nfilmmakers were told the full name of the Navy SEAL, and the first names of the CIA officers.\n\n       Judicial Watch, a non-profit organization that promotes government accountability,\n\nsubmitted a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request for all records of CIA and\n\nDepartment of Defense communications with the filmmakers. The agencies produced most of\n\nthose records, some of which were redacted in places, and withheld others, primarily on the\n\ngrounds of attorney-client privilege. Judicial Watch does not challenge the withholdings. The\n\nonly redactions that it challenges are the names of the SEAL and the CIA officers.\n\n       Judicial Watch concedes that the names of those individuals would normally be exempt\n\nfrom disclosure. But the organization argues that the government placed their names in the\n\fpublic domain by revealing them to the filmmakers, and now must provide that information to\n\nanyone who requests it. Under the law of this circuit, a FOIA requester who would prevail on\n\nthat argument must identify “specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being\n\nwithheld.” Public Citizen v.

Because the government has withheld the names pursuant to a concededly valid\n\nFOIA exemption and has not placed them in the public domain, its motion for summary\n\njudgment will be granted.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In August 2011, Judicial Watch sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the Central\n\nIntelligence Agency and the Department of Defense, seeking all records of communications with\n\nKathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, respectively the director and screenwriter of “an upcoming\n\nfilm . . . tentatively titled, ‘Killing bin Laden.’” Judicial Watch also requested all records of\n\ncommunications with “Megan Ellison and/or any other officer or employee of Annapurna\n\nPictures, the financiers of the film” and “all records concerning, regarding or related to the\n\nupcoming film” itself. The time frame for the request was January 1, 2011 through August 9,\n\n2011. Decl. of Martha M. Lutz, Information Review Officer, Director’s Area, Central\n\nIntelligence Agency (Sept. 14, 2012) (“Lutz Decl.”), Ex. A (FOIA Request from Judicial Watch\n\n(Aug. 9, 2011)), at 1; Decl. of Mark H.

Jacobsmeyer, Chief, Office of Freedom of\n\nInformation, Department of Defense (Aug. 22, 2011)).\n\n       Judicial Watch filed this suit in January 2012. In May of that year, the Department of\n\nDefense produced 153 pages of responsive records, Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4, while the CIA\n\nproduced sixty-seven responsive documents and withheld twenty-seven, primarily on the\n\ngrounds of attorney-client privilege, Lutz Decl. at ¶ 9. Both agencies produced additional\n\nresponsive records that August. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4; Lutz Decl. at ¶ 9.\n\n       A sixteen-page transcript of a background interview with Kathryn Bigelow and Mark\n\nBoal (collectively, “the filmmakers”) was among the documents that the Department of Defense\n\nproduced. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 4. Names mentioned by either Mark Boal or Michael Vickers,\n\nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, were redacted from five places in the transcript.\n\nThe first three redactions occurred in the following exchange:\n\n       Mark Boal: I’ll take [NAME REDACTED] or someone like that.\n\n       Michael Vickers: Well the basic idea is they’ll make a guy available who was\n       involved from the beginning as a planner; a SEAL Team 6 Operator and\n       Commander.\n\n       Mark Boal: Are you talking about [NAME REDACTED]?\n\n       Michael Vickers: A guy name[d] [NAME REDACTED]. And so, he basically can\n       probably give you everything you would want or would get from Adm[.] Olson or\n       Adm[.] McRaven.\n\nId., Ex. C (Transcript of Background Interview (July 15, 2011)) (“Background Interview”), page\n\nnumbered DoD 140. The redacted names are, in order of appearance, (1) the first and last name\n\nof a member of the Department of Defense, (2) the rank and last name of another member of the\n\n\n                                                3\n\fDepartment of Defense, and (3) the last name followed by the full name—as in “Smith, John\n\nSmith”—of a third member of the Department of Defense. Id. at ¶ 7. After the filmmakers\n\nexpressed their pleasure at this arrangement, Under Secretary Vickers went on:\n\n       And so, he’ll speak for operators and he’ll speak for senior military commanders,\n       because the[y’re] all the same tribe and everything, and so you should get most of\n       what you need from him. Now, again the reason Adm[.] Olson and Adm[.]\n       McRaven didn’t want to talk is this command conflict of interest. And then with\n       [NAME REDACTED] the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any\n       way as a consultant, because again, it’s the same thing, he shouldn’t be talking out\n       of school, this at least, this gives him one step removed and he knows what he can\n       and can’t say, but this way at least he can be as open as he can with you and it ought\n       to meet your needs and give you lots of color.\n\nBackground Interview, page numbered DoD 140. At the end of the interview, Under Secretary\n\nVickers asked “So should I have [NAME REDACTED] reach out to you?” Id., page numbered\n\nDoD 153. These redactions are, respectively, the last name of the individual that he mentioned\n\nearlier, and the rank and last name of that same person. Herrington Decl. at ¶ 7. The three\n\nindividuals whose names have been redacted were all assigned to routinely deployable units. Id.\n\n       Among the documents produced by the Central Intelligence Agency were two internal\n\nemail chains that contained the names of undercover CIA officers who played a role in planning\n\nthe Bin Laden operation and later met with the filmmakers. Lutz Decl. at ¶¶ 12, 14–15. The\n\nfirst and last name of one such officer was redacted from the first email chain, and the first\n\nnames of that officer and three others were redacted from the second chain. Id. at ¶¶ 14–15. The\n\nCIA explains that “when the meetings with the filmmakers took place at the CIA Headquarters,\n\nthe guidance provided to the officers who were . . . in sensitive positions was that they should\n\nprovide the filmmakers with their true first names only.” Id. at ¶ 12; see also id. at ¶ 14 (“To my\n\nknowledge, the only redacted information in this email that may have been shared with the\n\n\n                                                 4\n\ffilmmakers during the meetings was the first name of one of the officers who is in the email\n\nchain’s distribution line.

In that (admittedly\n\nlimited) case, a FOIA requester who seeks information he does not possess can still meet “his\n\n‘burden of showing that there is permanent public record of the exact [information] he wishes,’”\n\nid. at 554 (quoting Davis, 968 F.2d at 1280 (emphasis added in Cottone), by pointing to his right\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fof access to the very information being withheld.1 “[V]ery often . . . some type of hard copy\n\nfacsimile will be the only practicable way for a FOIA requester to demonstrate that the specific\n\ninformation he has solicited has indeed circulated into the public domain,” id. at 555; see also\n\nDavis, 968 F.2d at 1280, but “often” is not “always.”\n\n       In a similar vein, the D.C. Circuit has entertained the argument that there may be “slight\n\nvariation[s]” on the public domain doctrine. Students Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836\n\n(quoting party’s brief). In Students Against Genocide, an organization seeking reconnaissance\n\nphotographs (which reportedly showed evidence of an atrocity committed by Bosnian Serbs in\n\nthe town of Srebrenica) contended that then-Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine\n\nAlbright had “waived the government’s right to invoke . . . FOIA exemptions by displaying the\n\nwithheld photographs to the delegates of the foreign governments that are members of the [U.N.]\n\nSecurity Council.” Id. The court quickly disposed of the organization’s argument from the\n\npublic domain doctrine, explaining that:\n\n       The photographs in question here plainly do not fall within that doctrine. They were\n       not released to the general public; only the Security Council delegates saw them. In\n       fact, the photographs were not “released” at all. Although Ambassador Albright\n       displayed them to the delegates, she retained custody, and none left the U.N.\n\n\n\n       1\n           Presumably, information is only in the public domain under Cottone if the right to\naccess it could be successfully invoked. For instance, “the right to inspect and copy judicial\nrecords,” Nat’l Broad. Co., 653 F.2d at 613—though “indisputable,” id. at 612—is “not\nabsolute,” id. at 613.

If a\ndistrict court had refused to allow the copying of the recordings sought in Cottone (and had not\nabused its discretion in doing so) then the fact that they had been played at trial presumably\nwould not have availed the FOIA requester. The question of how a court hearing a FOIA case\nshould assess whether the copying of trial records would have been (or should be) permitted was\nnot addressed by Cottone and need not be discussed here.\n\n                                                12\n\f        chamber. Hence there is no “permanent public record” of the photographs. See\n        Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554.\n\nId. (citation omitted).\n\n        The court then considered the “slight variation” on the public domain doctrine offered by\n\nthe organization, which contended that “by disclosing the photographs to the members of the\n\nSecurity Council, the government . . . let ‘the cat . . . out of the bag,’ and whatever damage\n\ndisclosure might do has already been done.” Id. (quoting party’s brief) (second ellipses in\n\noriginal). This argument sprang from the logic behind the public domain doctrine—that, “where\n\ninformation requested ‘is truly public . . . enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its\n\npurposes,’” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19)—rather than its\n\nformal insistence that a disclosure be memorialized in a “permanent public record,” see Cottone,\n\n193 F.3d at 554; Davis, 968 F.2d at 1280.\n\n        The Students Against Genocide court addressed the argument from principle on its own\n\nterms, rather than simply enforcing the formal requirement. It rejected the contention that,\n\nhaving shown the photographs to foreigners, the government was obliged to provide them to\n\nAmericans, assuming instead that “if the requested photographs are released, they will eventually\n\nmake their way to foreign governments” which had not previously seen them. Students Against\n\nGenocide, 257 F.3d at 837. The court credited the assertion that the United States “may have\n\naffirmative foreign policy reasons for sharing sensitive information with some foreign\n\ngovernments and not with others,” and found it “significant that Ambassador Albright displayed,\n\nbut did not distribute, the photographs in question,” which prevented “professional imagery\n\nanalysts” from “mak[ing] detailed examinations” that might reveal the “technical capabilities of\n\n[U.S.] reconnaissance systems.” Id. The court therefore concluded that the cat was not out of\n\n                                                 13\n\fthe bag at all: the release of the photographs could harm national interests by allowing foreign\n\ngovernments which had not seen the images to do so, and could moreover facilitate attempts to\n\nlearn the technical capabilities of American reconnaissance systems. Because the withholding of\n\nthe photographs continued to serve a valid purpose, the court enforced the applicable FOIA\n\nexemptions. Id.\n\n       If Cottone holds that FOIA requesters may, on rare occasions, use the public domain\n\ndoctrine to gain information that they do not possess, Students Against Genocide suggests that\n\nthe principle motivating that doctrine—that “where information requested ‘is truly public . . .\n\nenforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes,’” Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting\n\nNiagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19)—may have implications beyond the simple rule that the\n\ngovernment must release information that has been “disclosed and preserved in a permanent\n\npublic record,” Students Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554).\n\nThis is not certain—the opinion also says that “[f]or the public domain doctrine to apply, the\n\nspecific information sought must have already been ‘disclosed and preserved in a permanent\n\npublic record,’” id. (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554) (emphasis added))—but the court’s\n\nwillingness to entertain the argument holds the possibility open.\n\n       Not that either case does Judicial Watch much good. That organization has not, per\n\nCottone, identified any non-FOIA right to the names at issue here. Arguing from the slender\n\nopening in Students Against Genocide, Judicial Watch encourages the court to adopt the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s holding that although “the ‘public domain’ test articulated by the D.C. Circuit is one\n\npersuasive way of determining when the government has waived [an exemption] under FOIA, it\n\nshould not be the only test for government waiver.” Watkins v. U.S. Bureau of Customs &\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fBorder Prot., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216306\"><a href=\"/opinion/216306/watkins-v-us-bureau-of-customs-and-border/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1197 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). The additional test\n\npropounded by Watkins holds that when the government has made “a no-strings-attached\n\ndisclosure of . . . confidential information to a private third party” it has waived its ability to\n\nwithhold that information under FOIA, whether or not “the disclosure was . . . preserved in a\n\n‘permanent public record.’” Id.; see also id. at 1198 (“[W]hen an agency freely discloses to a\n\nthird party confidential information covered by a FOIA exemption without limiting the third\n\nparty’s ability to further disseminate the information then the agency waives the ability to claim\n\nan exemption to a FOIA request for the disclosed information.”).2\n\n        Judicial Watch reasons that the disclosures to the filmmakers were made with “no strings\n\nattached,” see id. at 1197—that is,“without limiting the [filmmakers’] ability to further\n\ndisseminate the information,” id. at 1198—and that, under Watkins, the government has\n\ntherefore waived its ability to assert Exemption 3. Even if that description of the disclosures\n\nwere accurate (and it may not be: when Under Secretary Vickers mentioned the Navy SEAL, he\n\nemphasized that “the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way,” Background\n\nInterview, page numbered DoD 140) it would not be enough to establish waiver in this circuit.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has been clear that the enforcement of an otherwise applicable exemption is\n\nonly pointless when the withheld information is “truly public,” Students Against Genocide, 257\n\nF.3d at 836 (quoting Cottone, 193 F.3d at 555); Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19, when it “has\n\nentered and remains in the public domain,” Davis, 968 F.2d at 1279 (emphasis added). If the\n\nfilmmakers had publicized the names that they learned and the government now seeks to\n\n        2\n          As a dissenting judge acknowledged, the Watkins test is at odds with the precedents of\nthis circuit. Watkins, 643 F.3d at 1199 (Rymer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“I\npart company only with respect to whether we should adopt the ‘public domain’ test for waiver\nembraced by the D.C. Circuit . . . . I think we should.”).\n\n                                                  15\n\fwithhold, this would be a much harder case, one that might turn on the question of whether those\n\nnames had been “officially acknowledged.” See Fitzgibbon v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546873\"><a href=\"/opinion/546873/alan-l-fitzgibbon-v-central-intelligence-agency-alan-l-fitzgibbon-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990). But this is not that case. The names have not been “released to the general public,”\n\nStudents Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 836, and Judicial Watch cannot meet its “initial burden\n\nof pointing to specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being withheld.”\n\nPublic Citizen, 11 F.3d at 201; accord Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1130.3\n\n       Because Judicial Watch cannot do so, it makes one more effort to amend the public\n\ndomain doctrine. The organization suggests that official disclosures have been held not to place\n\ninformation in the public domain when they were made for an important governmental purpose.\n\nFrom this premise, Judicial Watch appears to conclude that because the disclosures at issue here\n\nwere made to assist in the production of a film and not (it says) for any important purpose, they\n\n(unlike the others) put information into the public domain. The first problem with this argument\n\nis that it is irreconcilable with the doctrine discussed above. Judicial Watch would apparently\n\nrecast its burden of production as an obligation to either “point[] to specific information in the\n\n\n\n       3\n           McKinley v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.D.C. 2012), is not to the contrary. After summarizing the Board of Governors’ argument on a\nquestion of waiver—the Board “maintain[ed] that . . . publication [of certain records on the\nwebsite of a congressional committee did] not waive the Board’s FOIA exemptions because the\nrecords were provided to the [committee] under a written confidentiality agreement that did not\nauthorize public disclosure”—the McKinley court held that “[d]isclosures to Congress are not\nofficial disclosures within the meaning of FOIA and do not waive an agency’s FOIA\nExemptions,” and neither does “the mere fact that the committee subsequently, and without\nauthorization, published the records.” Id. at 60. The holding rested on who made the disclosure,\nand whether it was authorized: if the Board had made an official disclosure within the meaning\nof FOIA or if it had authorized a third party to make such a disclosure, then it would have\nwaived its exemptions. Judicial Watch advocates the inverse rule: that unless an agency forbids\na third party from disclosing information, then it has waived its exemptions, regardless of\nwhether the third party actually discloses that information. For the reasons discussed above, that\nposition cannot survive an encounter with the law of this circuit.\n\n                                                 16\n\fpublic domain that duplicates that being withheld” or identify a disclosure that, although not\n\npublicly documented, was made for an unimportant reason. As should by now be obvious, that\n\nis not the law of this circuit.\n\n        And if that were not enough, the second problem with this argument is that it misreads\n\nthe cases on which it relies. Students Against Genocide did not add some “governmental\n\npurpose” element to the public domain doctrine, but (as discussed above) simply reaffirmed its\n\nroots in the principle that when “enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes,” there\n\nis no point in enforcing it. Cottone, 193 F.3d at 554 (quoting Niagara Mohawk, 169 F.3d at 19).\n\n        In Muslim Advocates v. United States Department of Justice, a court in this district held\n\nthat the Federal Bureau of Investigation had not placed certain chapters of its Domestic\n\nInvestigations and Operations Guide into the public domain when it showed them to a handful of\n\ncivil rights and civil liberties groups. Reasoning from Students Against Genocide, the court\n\nnoted that “the disputed chapters were not released to the general public,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n100 (D.D.C. 2011), and had not “circulated into the public domain,” id. at 101 (quoting Cottone,\n\n193 F.3d at 555). In a footnote rejecting the argument that the public domain doctrine applied\n\ndifferently in the cases of Exemptions 1 and 7(E), the Muslim Advocates court took account of\n\nthe “circumstances of prior disclosure”—described above—but not its purposes. Id. at 102 n.8\n\n(quoting Carson v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382667\"><a href=\"/opinion/382667/birchel-l-carson-v-u-s-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1008</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1015 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). Neither of\n\nthese cases stands for the proposition that disclosures made for an insufficiently important\n\ngovernmental purpose necessarily put information into the public domain.4\n\n        4\n         Because the court concludes that the names at issue here were properly withheld\npursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, it need not consider the government’s argument that the\nwithholding was also proper under Exemption 6. See Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 762 n.12\n(“Because Exemption 7(C) covers this case, there is no occasion to address the application of\n\n                                                17\n\f                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Although it touches upon matters of considerable public concern, this case presents an\n\nexceedingly narrow question: whether a FOIA requester that knows information has been\n\ndisclosed to a private party is necessarily entitled to that same disclosure. Under the law of this\n\ncircuit, the answer to that question is “No.” Otherwise exempt information does not enter the\n\npublic domain unless it becomes “truly public,” which the names at issue here have not.\n\nBecause the plaintiff has not carried its “burden of pointing to specific information in the public\n\ndomain that duplicates that being withheld,” the government’s motion for summary judgment\n\nwill be granted.\n\n                                                              Rudolph Contreras\n                                                              United States District Judge\n\n       Date: August 28, 2013\n\n\n\n\nExemption 6.”).\n\n                                                 18\n\f</pre>",
