(\"U.S. Sound\") asserts that the\nTownship of Brick, New Jersey (\"the Township\"), and its\nPlanning Board (\"the Board\") violated U.S. Sound's First\nAmendment right to free expression by imposing unjustified\nconditions on its right to operate a video store in the\nTownship. The district court denied U.S. Sound's motion for\na partial summary judgment as to liability, denied its\nalternative application for a preliminary injunction, and\ngranted summary judgment for the Township and the\nBoard. We will reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn November 1995, U.S. Sound contracted to purchase\nproperty in Brick, New Jersey, which it planned to use as\na video store offering \"sales and rentals with video preview\nbooths, books, magazines and sundries.\" App. at 273. The\nproperty is located within 600 feet of a structure that, since\nSeptember 1996, has been used to house all of the\nkindergarten and most of the first grade classes in Brick,\nand it is also within 1500 feet of the Brick High School. An\nOcean Ice Palace, which is frequented by young customers,\n\n                                2\n\n\n\nstands across the street, and not far away is the only\nbranch of the Ocean County Public Library in Brick.\n\nU.S. Sound intended to convert the property from its\nthen current use as a hair salon; therefore, it had to apply\nto the Planning Board for a \"change of use.\" Its application\nincluded a simple floor plan showing a 1000-square-foot\nsingle room with display racks and several booths for\npreviewing movies available for rent. It described its\nprojected video collection as including \"rated and unrated\ntitles in a broad range of categories such as drama,\ncomedy, action, classical, documentary, musical, sports,\nnature and adult-theme videos in order to attract as broad\na patronage as possible.\" App. at 88.\n\nThe Board approved the change of use subject to the\nfollowing conditions, among others that are not challenged\nbefore us:\n\n       There shall be no private viewing of movies within an\n\f       enclosed area anywhere upon the premises or within\n       the structure. Movies may, however, be previewed\n       without barriers, obstructions or privacy provided the\n       movies are not rated R, X, and NC and/or NC 17 or\n       any other rating other than G or PG.\n\n       . . .\n\n        In the event that the applicant chooses to sell books,\n       magazines, periodicals or other printed material or\n       photographs, films, motion pictures, video cassettes,\n       slides or other visual representations [described in New\n       Jersey's \"Sexually Oriented Business Law\" 1] then the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The law encompasses printed and recorded media that \"depict or\ndescribe a `specified sexual activity' or `specified anatomical area.' \"\nSpecified sexual activity includes \"(1) The fondling or other erotic\ntouching of covered or uncovered human genitals, pubic region, buttock\nor female breasts; or (2) Any actual or simulated act of human\nmasturbation, sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse.\"\nSpecified anatomical areas include \"(1) Less than complete and opaquely\ncovered human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breasts below\na point immediately above the top of the areola; or (2) Human male\ngenitals in a discernibly turgid state even if covered.\" Chapter 230, Laws\nof 1995 (codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:34-6 (West Supp. 1997)).\n\n                                3\n\n\n\n       sale of such materials can only take place in an area of\n       the premises that is separated, separately walled\n       through which admission can only be gained by a\n       separate door which shall have a sign affixed to it\n       stating that admission is only to those persons over\n       eighteen years of age. Such area shall not consume\n       more than ten percent of the square floor area of the\n       structure.\n\nApp. at 228-29.\n\nDissatisfied with these conditions, U.S. Sound filed suit\nin the district court against the Board and the Township\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that the Board's blanket\nprohibition of preview booths and its content-based\nrestriction of adult-theme materials to 100 square feet\ninhibited U.S. Sound's free expression in violation of the\nFirst Amendment.\n\nAfter the Township and the Board answered,   U.S. Sound\nmoved for partial summary judgment and, in   the\nalternative, for a preliminary injunction.   In response, the\nTownship and the Board moved for a summary   judgment in\n\ftheir favor. In support of their own motion and in\nopposition to those of U.S. Sound, the Township and the\nBoard advanced only one justification for the challenged\nconditions: the protection of minors from exposure to adult\nentertainment materials. U.S. Sound acknowledged that\nthis was a \"compelling state interest\" for purposes of the\nstrict scrutiny test and a \"substantial state interest\" for\npurposes of the intermediate scrutiny test. It insisted,\nhowever, that this legitimate interest of the Township and\nthe Board did not justify the conditions imposed under\neither test.\n\nRelying on City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475\nU.S. 41 (1986), the district court subjected the Township's\nregulation of U.S. Sound's proposed activities to\nintermediate scrutiny and held that it survived that\nscrutiny. Accordingly, it denied U.S. Sound's motions for\npartial summary judgment and a preliminary injunction\nand granted the motion of the Township and the Board.\nWith no federal claims left pending before it, the court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over several\n\n                                4\n\n\n\nstate claims asserted by U.S. Sound and dismissed those\nclaims without prejudice.\n\nThe district court properly exercised jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. S 1331, and this court has appellate jurisdiction\nto review the district court's final order under 28 U.S.C.\nS 1291.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n\"Speech, be it in the form of film, live presentations, or\nprinted matter, that is sexually explicit in content but not\n`obscene' is protected under the First Amendment.\" Phillips\nv. Borough of Keyport, 107 F.3d 164, 172 (3d Cir. 1997). If\nthe government regulates non-obscene expression based on\nits sexually explicit content, the restrictions imposed pass\nconstitutional muster only if they survive \"strict scrutiny\"--\nthat is, only if they serve a compelling state interest in a\nmanner which imposes the least possible burden on\nexpression. Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S.\n115, 126 (1989). On the other hand, if the government acts\nto ameliorate the undesirable \"secondary effects\" of sexually\nexplicit expression, its regulation is regarded as \"content-\nneutral\" and enjoys a more deferential standard of\n\"intermediate,\" rather than \"strict,\" scrutiny. City of Renton\nv. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986)(applying\nintermediate scrutiny to a zoning ordinance designed \"to\nprevent crime, protect the city's retail trade, [and] maintain\n\fproperty values\"); see also Ben Rich Trading, Inc. v. City of\nVineland, 1997 WL 567320, at *5 (3d Cir. 1997); Phillips,\n107 F.3d at 172. Content-neutral governmental regulation\nsurvives this \"intermediate scrutiny\" if it is narrowly\ntailored to serve a substantial governmental interest and\nleaves open ample alternative channels for communication\nof the restricted expression. As we noted in Phillips,\n\n       [w]hile the requirement of narrow tailoring does not\n       mean that the ordinance must be the least restrictive\n       means of serving the Borough's substantial interests,\n       \"[g]overnment may not regulate expression in such a\n       manner that a substantial portion of the burden on\n       speech does not serve to advance its goals.\" Ward v.\n       Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799; 109 S. Ct.\n       2746, 2758, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989).\n\n                                5\n\n\n\nId. at 174.\n\nThe Township and the Board persuaded the district court\nthat although the regulation imposed by the Board's\nresolution singles out adult entertainment for special\ntreatment, it is content-neutral because it is aimed not at\nthe sexually explicit content but rather at the \"secondary\neffects\" of that entertainment on children. Accordingly, the\ncourt applied the intermediate scrutiny test of Renton.\nIntermediate scrutiny was not appropriate, however,\nbecause \"[l]isteners' reactions to speech are not the type of\n`secondary effects' . . . referred to in Renton.\" Boos v. Barry,\n485 U.S. 312, 321 (1988). As the Supreme Court explained\nin Boos:\n\n       To take an example factually close to Renton, if the\n       ordinance there was justified by the city's desire to\n       prevent the psychological damage it felt was associated\n       with viewing adult movies, then analysis of the\n       measure as a content-based statute would have been\n       appropriate. The hypothetical regulation targets the\n       direct impact of a particular category of speech, not a\n       secondary feature that happens to be associated with\n       that type of speech.\n\nId. at 321.\n\nThe impact of protected speech on minors is a direct,\nrather than a secondary, effect, and a regulation that\nsingles out non-obscene sexually explicit material because\nof its impact on minors is not content-neutral. This is clear\nfrom the Supreme Court's recent decision in Reno v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (1997),\n\fwhere the Court struck down two provisions of the\nCommunications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). The Attorney\nGeneral urged that the challenged provisions should be\nsubjected to intermediate scrutiny under Renton because\nthe Act was designed to protect minors from exposure to\n\"indecent\" and \"patently offensive\" speech on the Internet.\nThe Court rejected this position:\n\n        In Renton, we upheld a zoning ordinance that kept\n       adult movie theatres out of residential neighborhoods.\n       The ordinance was aimed, not at the content of the\n       films shown in the theaters, but rather at the\n\n                                6\n\n\n\n       \"secondary effects\"--such as crime and deteriorating\n       property values--that these theaters fostered:\" `It is\n       th[e] secondary effect which these zoning ordinances\n       attempt to avoid, not the dissemination of \"offensive\"\n       speech.' \" . . . [T]he purpose of the CDA is to protect\n       children from the primary effects of \"indecent\" and\n       \"patently offensive\" speech, rather than any\n       \"secondary\" effect of such speech. Thus, the CDA is a\n       content-based blanket restriction on speech, and, as\n       such, cannot be \"properly analyzed as a form of time,\n       place, and manner regulation.\" 475 U.S., at 46, 106 S.\n       Ct. at 928. See also Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 321,\n       108 S. Ct. 1157, 1163, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988)\n       (\"Regulations that focus on the direct impact of speech\n       on its audience\" are not properly analyzed under\n       Renton); Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505\n       U.S. 123, 134 (112 S. Ct. 2395, 2403, 120 L.Ed.2d 101\n       (1992) (\"Listeners' reaction to speech is not a content-\n       neutral basis for regulation\").\n\nId. at 2342-43 (citation omitted).\n\nBecause the Township and the Board seek to justify the\nBoard's resolution on the sole basis of a desire to protect\nminors from exposure to adult entertainment, Reno\nrequires that we subject that resolution to strict scrutiny.\nOur conclusion would not be different, however, if we were\npersuaded that Renton supplies the appropriate test. While\nprotecting minors from exposure to adult entertainment\ncan accurately be characterized as a compelling and a\nsubstantial governmental interest, the regulation imposed\nby the Board's resolution is neither the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that interest nor narrowly tailored to\nserve that interest. Accordingly, we conclude that the\nBoard's resolution restricted protected speech in violation of\nU.S. Sound's right to free expression under the First\nAmendment.\n\fWhen the Township and Board's regulation of protected\nspeech was challenged, they bore the burden under both\nthe strict and intermediate scrutiny tests of identifying the\ngovernmental interest or interests that motivated the\nBoard's resolution and of coming forward with facts which\nwould support a conclusion that the resolution was\n\n                                7\n\n\n\nsufficiently narrowly drawn to serve that interest or those\ninterests. Phillips, 107 F.3d at 172-73.2 They have failed to\ndo so.\n\nThere is no question that the Constitution allows the\nTownship to foreclose display and distribution of adult\nmaterials to minors. Indeed, U.S. Sound acknowledges that\nthe Township can promote its compelling state interest in\nprotecting minors from exposure to adult entertainment by\nrequiring U.S. Sound to market adult materials only in\nsegregated space to which minors are denied access. But\nU.S. Sound objects to the additional burdens on its\nexpressive activities. As U.S. Sound stresses, even under\nRenton, the Township may not regulate its expressive\nactivities in such a way that \"a substantial portion of the\nburden . . . does not serve to advance\" the professed goal\nof preventing exposure of minors to adult entertainment.\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989).\n\nWhile the Township and the Board have identified the\ngovernmental interest they purport to be serving, they\ncannot explain why, having denied minors access to the\nonly area in which adult entertainment can be marketed,\nthe risk of minors' exposure to adult material will be\nreduced by limiting that area to ten percent of the floor\nspace of the facility. Nor can they explain why, having\ndenied minors access to the only area in which adult\nentertainment can be marketed, the risk of minors'\nexposure to adult material will be reduced by eliminating\nprivate previewing booths from the segregated area, or, for\nthat matter, from the space to which access is not\nrestricted. It necessarily follows that the motion of the\nTownship and the Board for summary judgment should\nhave been denied and that U.S. Sound's motion for partial\nsummary judgment should have been granted.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Township and the Board complain that U.S. Sound, prior to filing\nsuit, never volunteered to segregate its adult materials. U.S. Sound\ndisputes this, and the record does not resolve this controversy.\nNonetheless, regardless of what U.S. Sound did or did not propose, the\nBoard had an affirmative duty when undertaking to restrict protected\n\fspeech to confine its restrictions within constitutional limits.\n\n                                8\n\n\n\nBecause the Township and the Board have sought to\njustify the entire burden of their regulations of protected\nspeech on the sole basis that minors should not be exposed\nto adult entertainment, our holding is a very narrow one.\nWe do not hold that a municipality may not regulate private\nviewing booths for adult entertainment where it perceives\nserious secondary effects from their use that can be\nameliorated only by such regulation. See, e.g., Ben Rich\nTrading, Inc. v. City of Vineland, 1997 WL 567320, at *10-\n*11 (3d Cir. 1997); Mitchell v. Commission on Adult\nEntertainment Est., 10 F.3d 123, 133 (3d Cir. 1993). Nor do\nwe hold that a municipality is powerless to limit the\namount of adult entertainment marketed by a video store\nwhere it can prove that a store with a higher percentage of\nadult material will have serious secondary effects on the\nresidential neighborhood that surrounds the store. Nor do\nwe suggest that where a video store that will be patronized\nby minors elects to screen previews on a public screen, a\nmunicipality cannot prohibit public exhibition of previews\nof adult entertainment.\n\nIII.\n\nThe premises on which U.S. Sound wishes to conduct its\nvideo business are currently occupied by another\nproprietor, and the owner of those premises disputes that\nU.S. Sound has a right to possession. Indeed, the owner\ndisputes whether U.S. Sound has had a right to possession\nat any point after the Board's resolution of March 13, 1996.\nWhether or not U.S. Sound has a right to present\npossession is, of course, highly relevant to whether there is\na current need for injunctive relief. Moreover, the period\nduring which it has had a right to such possession may be\nrelevant in determining what, if any, damages are\nrecoverable by U.S. Sound. It is clear, based on the\nsummary judgment record, however, that U.S. Sound is at\nleast entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Board's\nresolution of March 13, 1996 violated its rights under the\nFirst Amendment. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment\nof the district court with instructions that it enter such a\ndeclaratory judgment and that it conduct such further\n\n                                9\n\n\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion as may be\nnecessary.\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                10\n\f",

(\"U.S. Sound\") asserts that the\nTownship of Brick, New Jersey (\"the Township\"), and its\nPlanning Board (\"the Board\") violated U.S. Sound's First\nAmendment right to free expression by imposing unjustified\nconditions on its right to operate a video store in the\nTownship. The district court denied U.S. Sound's motion for\na partial summary judgment as to liability, denied its\nalternative application for a preliminary injunction, and\ngranted summary judgment for the Township and the\nBoard. We will reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn November 1995, U.S. Sound contracted to purchase\nproperty in Brick, New Jersey, which it planned to use as\na video store offering \"sales and rentals with video preview\nbooths, books, magazines and sundries.\" App. at 273. The\nproperty is located within 600 feet of a structure that, since\nSeptember 1996, has been used to house all of the\nkindergarten and most of the first grade classes in Brick,\nand it is also within 1500 feet of the Brick High School. An\nOcean Ice Palace, which is frequented by young customers,\n\n                                2\n\n\n\nstands across the street, and not far away is the only\nbranch of the Ocean County Public Library in Brick.\n\nU.S. Sound intended to convert the property from its\nthen current use as a hair salon; therefore, it had to apply\nto the Planning Board for a \"change of use.\" Its application\nincluded a simple floor plan showing a 1000-square-foot\nsingle room with display racks and several booths for\npreviewing movies available for rent. It described its\nprojected video collection as including \"rated and unrated\ntitles in a broad range of categories such as drama,\ncomedy, action, classical, documentary, musical, sports,\nnature and adult-theme videos in order to attract as broad\na patronage as possible.\" App. at 88.\n\nThe Board approved the change of use subject to the\nfollowing conditions, among others that are not challenged\nbefore us:\n\n       There shall be no private viewing of movies within an\n\f       enclosed area anywhere upon the premises or within\n       the structure. Movies may, however, be previewed\n       without barriers, obstructions or privacy provided the\n       movies are not rated R, X, and NC and/or NC 17 or\n       any other rating other than G or PG.\n\n       . . .\n\n        In the event that the applicant chooses to sell books,\n       magazines, periodicals or other printed material or\n       photographs, films, motion pictures, video cassettes,\n       slides or other visual representations [described in New\n       Jersey's \"Sexually Oriented Business Law\" 1] then the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The law encompasses printed and recorded media that \"depict or\ndescribe a `specified sexual activity' or `specified anatomical area.' \"\nSpecified sexual activity includes \"(1) The fondling or other erotic\ntouching of covered or uncovered human genitals, pubic region, buttock\nor female breasts; or (2) Any actual or simulated act of human\nmasturbation, sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse.\"\nSpecified anatomical areas include \"(1) Less than complete and opaquely\ncovered human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breasts below\na point immediately above the top of the areola; or (2) Human male\ngenitals in a discernibly turgid state even if covered.\" Chapter 230, Laws\nof 1995 (codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:34-6 (West Supp. 1997)).\n\n                                3\n\n\n\n       sale of such materials can only take place in an area of\n       the premises that is separated, separately walled\n       through which admission can only be gained by a\n       separate door which shall have a sign affixed to it\n       stating that admission is only to those persons over\n       eighteen years of age. Such area shall not consume\n       more than ten percent of the square floor area of the\n       structure.\n\nApp. at 228-29.\n\nDissatisfied with these conditions, U.S. Sound filed suit\nin the district court against the Board and the Township\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that the Board's blanket\nprohibition of preview booths and its content-based\nrestriction of adult-theme materials to 100 square feet\ninhibited U.S. Sound's free expression in violation of the\nFirst Amendment.\n\nAfter the Township and the Board answered,   U.S. Sound\nmoved for partial summary judgment and, in   the\nalternative, for a preliminary injunction.   In response, the\nTownship and the Board moved for a summary   judgment in\n\ftheir favor. In support of their own motion and in\nopposition to those of U.S. Sound, the Township and the\nBoard advanced only one justification for the challenged\nconditions: the protection of minors from exposure to adult\nentertainment materials. U.S. Sound acknowledged that\nthis was a \"compelling state interest\" for purposes of the\nstrict scrutiny test and a \"substantial state interest\" for\npurposes of the intermediate scrutiny test. It insisted,\nhowever, that this legitimate interest of the Township and\nthe Board did not justify the conditions imposed under\neither test.\n\nRelying on City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111597\"><a href=\"/opinion/111597/renton-v-playtime-theatres-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), the district court subjected the Township's\nregulation of U.S. Sound's proposed activities to\nintermediate scrutiny and held that it survived that\nscrutiny. Accordingly, it denied U.S. Sound's motions for\npartial summary judgment and a preliminary injunction\nand granted the motion of the Township and the Board.\nWith no federal claims left pending before it, the court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over several\n\n                                4\n\n\n\nstate claims asserted by U.S. Sound and dismissed those\nclaims without prejudice.\n\nThe district court properly exercised jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. S 1331, and this court has appellate jurisdiction\nto review the district court's final order under 28 U.S.C.\nS 1291.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n\"Speech, be it in the form of film, live presentations, or\nprinted matter, that is sexually explicit in content but not\n`obscene' is protected under the First Amendment.\" Phillips\nv.

If\nthe government regulates non-obscene expression based on\nits sexually explicit content, the restrictions imposed pass\nconstitutional muster only if they survive \"strict scrutiny\"--\nthat is, only if they serve a compelling state interest in a\nmanner which imposes the least possible burden on\nexpression.

On the other hand, if the government acts\nto ameliorate the undesirable \"secondary effects\" of sexually\nexplicit expression, its regulation is regarded as \"content-\nneutral\" and enjoys a more deferential standard of\n\"intermediate,\" rather than \"strict,\" scrutiny.

Accordingly, the\ncourt applied the intermediate scrutiny test of Renton.\nIntermediate scrutiny was not appropriate, however,\nbecause \"[l]isteners' reactions to speech are not the type of\n`secondary effects' . . . referred to in Renton.\" Boos v.

As the Supreme Court explained\nin Boos:\n\n       To take an example factually close to Renton, if the\n       ordinance there was justified by the city's desire to\n       prevent the psychological damage it felt was associated\n       with viewing adult movies, then analysis of the\n       measure as a content-based statute would have been\n       appropriate. The hypothetical regulation targets the\n       direct impact of a particular category of speech, not a\n       secondary feature that happens to be associated with\n       that type of speech.\n\nId. at 321.\n\nThe impact of protected speech on minors is a direct,\nrather than a secondary, effect, and a regulation that\nsingles out non-obscene sexually explicit material because\nof its impact on minors is not content-neutral. This is clear\nfrom the Supreme Court's recent decision in Reno v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Attorney\nGeneral urged that the challenged provisions should be\nsubjected to intermediate scrutiny under Renton because\nthe Act was designed to protect minors from exposure to\n\"indecent\" and \"patently offensive\" speech on the Internet.\nThe Court rejected this position:\n\n        In Renton, we upheld a zoning ordinance that kept\n       adult movie theatres out of residential neighborhoods.\n       The ordinance was aimed, not at the content of the\n       films shown in the theaters, but rather at the\n\n                                6\n\n\n\n       \"secondary effects\"--such as crime and deteriorating\n       property values--that these theaters fostered:\" `It is\n       th[e] secondary effect which these zoning ordinances\n       attempt to avoid, not the dissemination of \"offensive\"\n       speech.' \" . . . [T]he purpose of the CDA is to protect\n       children from the primary effects of \"indecent\" and\n       \"patently offensive\" speech, rather than any\n       \"secondary\" effect of such speech. Thus, the CDA is a\n       content-based blanket restriction on speech, and, as\n       such, cannot be \"properly analyzed as a form of time,\n       place, and manner regulation.\" 475 U.S., at 46, 106 S.\n       Ct. at 928.

While\nprotecting minors from exposure to adult entertainment\ncan accurately be characterized as a compelling and a\nsubstantial governmental interest, the regulation imposed\nby the Board's resolution is neither the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that interest nor narrowly tailored to\nserve that interest. Accordingly, we conclude that the\nBoard's resolution restricted protected speech in violation of\nU.S. Sound's right to free expression under the First\nAmendment.\n\fWhen the Township and Board's regulation of protected\nspeech was challenged, they bore the burden under both\nthe strict and intermediate scrutiny tests of identifying the\ngovernmental interest or interests that motivated the\nBoard's resolution and of coming forward with facts which\nwould support a conclusion that the resolution was\n\n                                7\n\n\n\nsufficiently narrowly drawn to serve that interest or those\ninterests. Phillips, 107 F.3d at 172-73.2 They have failed to\ndo so.\n\nThere is no question that the Constitution allows the\nTownship to foreclose display and distribution of adult\nmaterials to minors. Indeed, U.S. Sound acknowledges that\nthe Township can promote its compelling state interest in\nprotecting minors from exposure to adult entertainment by\nrequiring U.S. Sound to market adult materials only in\nsegregated space to which minors are denied access. But\nU.S. Sound objects to the additional burdens on its\nexpressive activities. As U.S. Sound stresses, even under\nRenton, the Township may not regulate its expressive\nactivities in such a way that \"a substantial portion of the\nburden . . . does not serve to advance\" the professed goal\nof preventing exposure of minors to adult entertainment.\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (1989).\n\nWhile the Township and the Board have identified the\ngovernmental interest they purport to be serving, they\ncannot explain why, having denied minors access to the\nonly area in which adult entertainment can be marketed,\nthe risk of minors' exposure to adult material will be\nreduced by limiting that area to ten percent of the floor\nspace of the facility. Nor can they explain why, having\ndenied minors access to the only area in which adult\nentertainment can be marketed, the risk of minors'\nexposure to adult material will be reduced by eliminating\nprivate previewing booths from the segregated area, or, for\nthat matter, from the space to which access is not\nrestricted. It necessarily follows that the motion of the\nTownship and the Board for summary judgment should\nhave been denied and that U.S. Sound's motion for partial\nsummary judgment should have been granted.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Township and the Board complain that U.S. Sound, prior to filing\nsuit, never volunteered to segregate its adult materials. U.S. Sound\ndisputes this, and the record does not resolve this controversy.\nNonetheless, regardless of what U.S. Sound did or did not propose, the\nBoard had an affirmative duty when undertaking to restrict protected\n\fspeech to confine its restrictions within constitutional limits.\n\n                                8\n\n\n\nBecause the Township and the Board have sought to\njustify the entire burden of their regulations of protected\nspeech on the sole basis that minors should not be exposed\nto adult entertainment, our holding is a very narrow one.\nWe do not hold that a municipality may not regulate private\nviewing booths for adult entertainment where it perceives\nserious secondary effects from their use that can be\nameliorated only by such regulation. See, e.g., Ben Rich\nTrading, Inc. v. City of Vineland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">567320</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10-\n*11 (3d Cir. 1997); Mitchell v.

Nor do\nwe hold that a municipality is powerless to limit the\namount of adult entertainment marketed by a video store\nwhere it can prove that a store with a higher percentage of\nadult material will have serious secondary effects on the\nresidential neighborhood that surrounds the store. Nor do\nwe suggest that where a video store that will be patronized\nby minors elects to screen previews on a public screen, a\nmunicipality cannot prohibit public exhibition of previews\nof adult entertainment.\n\nIII.\n\nThe premises on which U.S. Sound wishes to conduct its\nvideo business are currently occupied by another\nproprietor, and the owner of those premises disputes that\nU.S. Sound has a right to possession. Indeed, the owner\ndisputes whether U.S. Sound has had a right to possession\nat any point after the Board's resolution of March 13, 1996.\nWhether or not U.S. Sound has a right to present\npossession is, of course, highly relevant to whether there is\na current need for injunctive relief. Moreover, the period\nduring which it has had a right to such possession may be\nrelevant in determining what, if any, damages are\nrecoverable by U.S. Sound. It is clear, based on the\nsummary judgment record, however, that U.S. Sound is at\nleast entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Board's\nresolution of March 13, 1996 violated its rights under the\nFirst Amendment. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment\nof the district court with instructions that it enter such a\ndeclaratory judgment and that it conduct such further\n\n                                9\n\n\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion as may be\nnecessary.\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                10\n\f</pre>",
