NW Mint also appeals the court's\n\nsupplemental judgment and order awarding attorney fees and costs to Auburn.\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the trial court's findings of fact, which support its\n\nconclusions that NW Mint breached the lease.      Because NW Mint identifies no\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/2\n\n\n\ncosts recoverable under the MTCA that are not recoverable under the lease, we\n\ndo not decide if the MTCA applies to this case. NW Mint fails to show that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion when it awarded costs and fees to Auburn. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n\n          NW Mint is a full service mint that fabricates coins and other metallic\n\nitems. In May 2002, Ross Hansen, d/b/a/ Northwest Territorial Mint, signed a six-\n\nyear agreement with MegaWest LLC to lease suite 101 of a commercial-\nindustrial property.1 The building was new when this lease began, and Ross\nHansen, d/b/a/ Northwest Territorial Mint, was the first tenant in suite 101. In\n\nJuly 2007, MegaWest sold the building and assigned its interest in the lease to\nAuburn. NW Mint occupied the premises and was a tenant under the lease from\n\nDecember 31, 2002, until April 30, 2010, when the lease ended.\n\n          Section 11 of the lease stated,\n\n\n      1 In December 2002, Hansen formed Northwest Territorial Mint LLC, which\nwas not a party to this lease agreement. The trial court concluded,\n          Northwest Territorial Mint, LLC was acting as a Tenant under the\n          Lease and as an operator of the mint business at the Auburn\n          property from December 31, 2001 through the end of NW Mint's\n          lease in April of 2010. NW Mint's operations at the Auburn property\n          were held out to the public as operations of Northwest Territorial\n          Mint, LLC. Northwest Territorial Mint, LLC succeeded to enough of\n          Hansen's rights and obligations under the Lease to be considered a\n          Tenant under the Lease. At a minimum, Northwest Territorial Mint,\n          LLC occupied the leased premises as its principal place of business\n          and made all of the monthly Lease payments to Auburn from 2007\n          until the end of the Lease.\nThe premises leased is located in an area zoned as M-1, which permits uses\nincluding \"residential, daycare, preschools, nursery schools, health and fitness\n clubs, restaurants, and other uses.\"\n\n                                            -2-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/3\n\n\n\n     HAZARDOUS WASTE. Tenant shall not store, generate, dispose\n     of or otherwise allow the release of any hazardous waste or\n     materials in, on or under the Premises, Property or Project or any\n     adjacent property, or in any improvements placed on the Premises.\n     Except as otherwise provided, Tenant represents and warrants to\n     Landlord that Tenant's intended use of the Premises does not\n     involve the use, production, disposal or bringing on to the Premises\n     of any Hazardous Waste. As used herein, the term \"Hazardous\n     Waste\" includes any substance, waste or material defined or\n     designated as hazardous, toxic or dangerous (or any similar term)\n     by any federal, state or local statute, regulation, rule or ordinance\n      now or hereafter in effect, including, but not limited to, the\n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\n     Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601, or the Washington Model Toxics\n     Control Act (\"MTCA\"), RCW 70.105D.010 et seq. Tenant shall\n     promptly comply with all statutes, regulations and ordinances, and\n      with all orders, decrees or judgments of governmental authorities or\n      courts having jurisdiction, relating to the use, collection, treatment,\n      disposal, storage, control, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Waste\n      in, on or under the Premises or any adjacent property, or\n      incorporated in any improvements, at Tenant's expense.            After\n      notice to Tenant and a reasonable opportunity for Tenant to effect\n      such, Landlord may, but is not obligated to, enter upon the\n      Premises and take such actions and incur such costs and\n      expenses to effect such compliance as it deems advisable to\n      protect its interest in the Premises; provided, however, that\n      Landlord shall not be obligated to give Tenant notice and an\n      opportunity to effect such compliance if (i) such delay might result\n      in material adverse damage to Landlord or the Property, (ii) Tenant\n      has already had actual knowledge of the situation and a reasonable\n      opportunity to effect such compliance, or (iii) an emergency exists.\n      Whether or not Tenant has actual knowledge of the release of\n      Hazardous Waste on the Premises or Property or any adjacent\n      property as the result of Tenant's use ofthe Premises, Tenant shall\n      reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord\n      in connection with such compliance activities. Tenant shall notify\n      Landlord immediately of any release of any Hazardous Waste in,\n      on, under or from the Premises, Property or Project. Tenant shall\n      indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord against any and all\n      losses, liabilities, suits, obligations, fines, damages, judgments,\n      penalties, claims, charges, cleanup costs, remedial actions, costs\n      and expenses (including, without limitation, consultant fees,\n      attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be imposed on,\n      incurred or paid by, or asserted against Landlord or the Premises,\n      Property or Project by reason of, or in connection with (i) any\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/4\n\n\n      misrepresentation, breach of warranty or other default by Tenant\n      under this Lease, or (ii) the acts or omissions by Tenant under this\n      Lease, or (iii) the acts or omissions of Tenant, or any sublessee or\n      other person for whom Tenant would otherwise be liable, resulting\n      in the release of any Hazardous Waste. This indemnity and\n      Tenant's other duties under this paragraph 11 shall survive the\n      termination of this Lease.\n\nSection 13 of the lease stated,\n\n      Tenant will at all times during the Term keep the Premises and all\n      systems therein and the doors and windows thereof neat, clean and\n      in good order, repair and in a sanitary condition. . . . Except for\n       reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire or unavoidable\n       casualty, Tenant will at all times preserve the Premises in as good\n       repair as they are now or may hereafter be put to. All repairs shall\n      be at Tenant's sole cost and expense, except for repairs required\n      for the outside roof, exterior walls and foundation which shall be\n       Landlord's responsibility. Tenant will, at all times, cause the\n       Premises to comply with all ordinances, regulations, rules or orders\n       of every governmental entity undertaking jurisdiction over the\n       Premises.\n\nThis provision also stated, \"Tenant agrees that at the expiration or sooner\n\ntermination of this Lease, Tenant will quit and surrender the Premises without\n\nnotice, and in a neat and broom clean condition.\" The lease also contained the\n\nfollowing attorney fee and cost provision:\n\n       If Landlord employs an attorney or if Landlord brings suit to recover\n       any rent due hereunder, or for breach of any other provision of this\n       Lease . . . , Landlord shall be awarded its attorney's fees, statutory\n       court costs, and all other litigation costs and expenses expended or\n       incurred in connection with such action and in any appellate or\n       collection proceedings. All sums due from Tenant to Landlord shall\n       bear interest at the Default Interest rate.\n\n       In June 2007, before purchasing the property, Auburn hired EBI\n\nConsulting to perform a phase Ienvironmental site assessment ofthe building. A\nphase I environmental site assessment report informs a potential purchaser or\nlender if the property contains or likely contains any recognized environmental\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/5\n\n\n\n\nconditions—any hazardous substances on a property under conditions that\n\nindicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of\n\nany hazardous substances into structures on the property or into the ground,\n\ngroundwater, or surface water of the property.            Recognized environmental\n\nconditions include hazardous substances under conditions in compliance with\n\nlaws but do not include de minimis conditions. Because a phase I environmental\n\nsite assessment is a screening tool to determine if any recognized environmental\n\nconditions warrant additional investigation, it does not include any actual\n\nsampling.    A phase I environmental site assessment also affords its user the\n\nability to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner,\n\ncontiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on\n\nliability   under    the   federal    Comprehensive      Environmental      Response,\n\nCompensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. § 9601, as well as the\n\nMTCA. Federal standards govern these assessments.\n\n        EBI's phase I environmental site assessment report noted that NW Mint\n\nused the property to produce commemorative coins. NW Mint used machinery\n\nand equipment including presses, stamps, and saws, and it used a commercial-\n\ngrade soap to polish the coins. EBI's report identified no evidence of recognized\n\nenvironmental       conditions   or   evidence   of   leaks,   staining,   or   obvious\n\naccumulations of metal dust.2 EBI's assessment did not include interviews with\n\n\n\n      2 At trial, a representative from EBI testified, \"And in the context of those\nconcentrations being relatively high concentrations in our sampling, for example,\nwe would be—that amount would be spread out over a square foot. So the\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/6\n\n\n\nany individuals from NW Mint. It also did not include inspections of HV/AC,\nheating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems, or of roof areas. Auburn relied\non EBI's phase Ienvironmental site assessment when it purchased the property.3\n       In May 2010, after the lease ended, Auburn hired EBI to survey the entire\ncondition of the premises.        This survey included an industrial hygiene\nassessment to allow Auburn \"to be sure that the property was safe for lease in an\n\nunrestricted manner to any particular type of tenant that they could attract to the\nproperty.\" EBI's survey did not include a human health risk assessment. If\ncontamination levels in collected samples were below EBI's own surface\ncontamination limits, EBI would certify the facility as clean and certify that a\n\ntenant could occupy the premises without restrictions or limitations.\n       In its \"Site Cleanliness Investigation Report,\" EBI determined that based\non its own surface contamination limits, the premises was \"grossly contaminated\nwith toxic metal dusts, fines, and process residuals.\"4            EBI found, \"All\n\nability to observe that is very limited.\" He also testified that EBI only later\n became aware that NW Mint conducted industrial processes on the premises,\nsuch as furnaces for melting metal, locations for pouring melted metal into molds,\n blasting operations, and electroplating.\n        3 The trial court concluded that Auburn undertook all appropriate inquiry\n into the previous ownership and uses of the premises consistent with good\n commercial practice.\n      4 In this report, EBI stated,\n       There are currently no regulatory limits addressing surface\n       contamination for industrial type settings, so EBI has developed\n       surface contamination limits based on regulatory daily intake and\n        exposure limits. If the contaminant concentration is less than these\n        developed surface limits, EBI is willing to confirm that the surfaces\n        are clean and that the facility is clean/free of hazardous toxic\n        contamination. However, all of the five (5) composite samples had\n        sufficient contamination to indicate that the facility is contaminated\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/7\n\n\n\nmanufacturing areas greatly exceed the limits for silver, selenium, and copper.\n\nAdditionally, at least one area exceeds the limit for each of the following toxic\n\nmetals: Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, cobalt, manganese, nickel and zinc.\"\n\nEBI concluded, \"Inhalation of the toxic metal dusts or skin contact of settled dust\n\ncould have significant harmful health effects.\" Further, \"[a]ny settled dusts or\n\nmetal fines would likely be listed or characterized as a regulated hazardous\n\nwaste.\"      EBI recommended that workers properly trained in exposure to\n\nhazardous substances clean the facility.\n\n       Before receiving EBI's report, Auburn did not believe that NW Mint\n\nreleased hazardous substances at the premises. Auburn shared the report with\n\nNW Mint and included a letter stating,\n\n                    Pursuant to, among others Sections ... 11 (\"Hazardous\n       Waste\"), 13 (\"Maintenance and Repairs; Redelivery\")... of the\n       Lease, we are affording your client the opportunity under the Lease\n       to take steps to remediate the contamination of the premises.\n       Action needs to be taken to bring contaminant levels down to safe\n       levels within the parameters of the specifications in the enclosed\n          report.\n\n          EBI issued a \"Lease Space Move Out Survey\" in June 2010 after\n\ninspecting the physical condition of the premises. In its report, EBI noted that\nHansen would not allow photographs of the building's interior and would not\n\nprovide answers about his business or manufacturing processes.            EBI was\n\n          with a number of toxic metals and should not be leased or occupied\n          without further cleaning and decontamination.\nAt trial, a representative from EBI testified, \"We used our approach, and if\nsomebody had offered a scientifically based actual alternative to cleaning up the\nproperty, that we could have ... had a dialogue on, we were more than happy to\ndo that. That never happened.\"\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/8\n\n\n\nunable to access the roof. EBI shared this survey with NW Mint and enclosed a\n\nletter stating, \"EBI Consulting has concluded that Ross Hansen did not properly\nmaintain the premises nor return the premises in good working condition as\n\nrequired under the terms of the Lease.\"\n\n      Auburn established a deadline of June 1, 2010, for NW Mint \"to agree to\n\nassume full responsibility for clean-up of the premises to a condition meeting the\n\nterms of the lease and satisfactory to EBI Consulting, such that the landlord is in\n\na position to safely market this space and to have that clean-up done\nimmediately.\" NW Mint hired AMEC, an environmental consultant, to review\nEBI's report. Before allowing AMEC to inspect the property, Auburn initially\ninsisted that NW Mint agree to responsibility for \"whatever clean-up that is\n\ndetermined by the experts needs to be done.\" NW Mint declined. In response to\nNW Mint's renewed request to access the premises, Auburn wrote a letter\n\nstating,\n\n       Because [Hansen] had been equivocal in prior communications\n       regarding your client as liable for this contamination, we believed it\n       would be an act of good faith on your client's part to acknowledge\n       his responsibility for such contamination, and that doing so would\n       facilitate better cooperation between the parties and a common\n       purpose to addressing and remediating the contamination,\n       especially given your client's lack of cooperation with the owner in\n       the past.[5]\n       AMEC completed its review of EBI's report in June 2010.                  AMEC\nconcluded, \"It is the opinion of AMEC that the EBI's methodology and approach\n\n\n           5Auburn ultimately permitted industrial hygienist Elisabeth Black to access\n the premises and conduct sampling.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/9\n\n\n\nare flawed and cannot be relied upon to determine whether there is a potential\n\nhealth risk to occupants of the building.\" It noted, \"AMEC has not established\n\nclean-up criteria for this facility at this time, but we would certainly use different\n\nmethodology to do so.\" It also stated, \"Further investigation is needed, and they\n\nmay conclude that there are areas that need to be cleaned up.\"\n\n       In June 2010, industrial hygienist Elisabeth Black developed a proposal for\n\nNW Mint \"to facilitate the removal of settled dust and metals.\" She expressed \"no\n\nreason to believe that the EBI results weren't accurate.\" Black \"took issue with,\n\nperhaps, their sampling method and clean-up criteria they established, but from\nmy perspective, in counseling my client, it seemed like going to clean-up was\n\nlikely the simplest option.\" NW Mint rejected Black's proposal.\n\n       In August 2010, Black presented NW Mint with a proposal to identify the\n\nlevels of metals and surface dust on the premises. Auburn's expert, Stephen\n\nFrost, accompanied Black as she sampled the premises and took side-by-side\n\nsamples.\n\n       In November 2010, Black issued a report concluding, based on a limited\n\namount of information, that the premises posed a potential hazard. Black also\n\nstated in her report, \"Whether or not this condition creates an adverse health\nimpact to a future tenant of the building cannot be determined based on available\ninformation.\"   She noted that the elevated samples were not attributable to\n\n background contamination from natural and human sources—these samples\nexceeded background levels. And she found that the metal concentrations and\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/10\n\n\n\ntypes of metals were unusual.6        Black recommended that an \"experienced\nabatement firm with training in hazardous waste operations\" conduct a \"thorough\n\ncleaning\" \"according to a protocol prepared by a certified industrial hygienist.\"\n\n       Auburn hired Clean Harbors to clean the premises. EBI oversaw Clean\n\nHarbors' remediation, which took place from January through October 2011.\n\nClean Harbors cleaned the premises according to EBI's contamination limits.\n\n       In October 2011, EBI issued to Auburn a certification letter confirming that\n\nfuture tenants could use suite 101 without restrictions or limitations attributable to\n\nhazardous metals.           In March 2012, EBI issued a \"Facility Cleaning &\n\nDecontamination Certification and        Environmental Closure Report,\" which\n\ndocumented the investigation and remediation work in suite 101.\n\n       In 2009, Auburn sued Hansen for breach of contract, seeking injunctive\n\nrelief and damages arising out of a dispute about access to an electrical room,\n\nphone room, and common areas of the premises. In 2010, Auburn sued NW\nMint, asserting breach of contract claims arising under the lease and a claim to\nrecover \"remedial action costs\" under RCW 70.105D.080. Auburn claimed that\n\nNW Mint breached the lease by contaminating the building with hazardous\n\n       6 Black testified,\n       [T]his is not a condition you would typically encounter, either in\n       types of metals or concentrations of metals. It is unusual because\n       we rarely ever get metals and surface dust values for an industrial\n       facility, it is type sampling that's fairly rare, unless it is directed at\n       lead, for which there are standards; it is not typically done.\n       Unusual, because I think, as I have said before, it puts the land\n       owner or properties owner in a condition that was going to require\n        some action to move forward and make that space leasable for\n        unrestricted use.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/11\n\n\n\n\nsubstances, as defined by federal and state law, by damaging the building in\n\nexcess of normal wear and tear, and by failing to remove tenant improvements.\n\nAuburn alleged over $1.3 million in damages. On February 11, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt consolidated these cases.\n\n       In January 2012, Auburn hired toxicology expert John Schell to conduct a\n\nhuman health risk assessment of the leased premises—a quantitative evaluation\n\nof risk.7   Schell testified at trial that a \"cleanup level\" under the MTCA is a\n\nprotective level that is safe for human health. He concluded that the levels of\n\narsenic, chromium-VI, copper, and selenium exceeded the MTCA cleanup\n\nstandards.8    Schell testified that before Clean Harbors cleaned the premises,\n\n\"Based on my calculations of a risk based cleanup level, some of those metals,\n\nthe concentrations in the dust, posed a potential health threat.\"\n\n        In June 2012, NW Mint applied to the Washington State Department of\n\nEcology's Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP).9             The Department of Ecology\n\n(Ecology) rejected NW Mint's application, reasoning,\n\n        We did not accept your application because the release you\n        reported does not constitute a hazardous waste site requiring\n        remedial action under the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA),\n\n        7 Schell testified that \"risk is a function of both the toxicity of the material\nand the dose that is received.\"\n      8 Schell relied upon a bulk dust sample analysis that Stephen Frost\nconducted, which determined the concentrations of constituent metals.

The court concluded that Hansen and Northwest Territorial\n\nMint LLC were \"strictly liable, jointly and severally, for all remedial action costs\n\nincurred by Auburn at the Auburn property.\" On November 14, 2012, the trial\ncourt entered an order granting in part and denying in part Auburn's motion to\n\namend these findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a judgment in\n\nfavor of Auiburn.10 In the judgment, the court awarded to Auburn $869,746.53 in\n\nremedial action costs under the MTCA and damages for NW Mint's breach of the\n\nlease. The court also awarded attorney fees and costs to Auburn under the\n\nMTCA and the lease.\n\n       On June 4, 2013, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment and\n\norder awarding $1,582,046.61 in costs and attorney fees to Auburn.\n\n       NW Mint appeals.\n\n\n\n\n       10   The court removed legal fees from Auburn's remedial action costs,\nreducing the calculation from $657,818.68 to $391,573.23.

As a result, we do not need to reach NW Mint's MTCA\n\nclaim.17\n\n       NW Mint makes three challenges to its liability under the lease. First, NW\n\nMint claims that \"the residual metals NW Mint left at the Premises did not present\n\na risk of actual harm to human health or the environment.\" Second, it alleges,\n\n\"NW Mint complied with all statutes, regulations and orders concerning\n\nhazardous wastes.\"    Third, NW Mint asserts, \"NW Mint left the Premises in a\n\n'broom clean' condition, which is the Lease's only cleanup standard.\" We reject\n\nthese contentions.\n\n\n       The trial court found, \"Section 13 of the Lease applies to the physical\n\ncondition of Suite 101, and the 'broom clean' specification in Section 13 does not\n\nmodify or supersede the requirements of Section 11 of the Lease regarding\n\nhazardous substances.\" It also found, \"NW Mint did not cooperate with Auburn's\n\ninvestigation and cleanup of the contamination in 2010 and 2011.\" The court\n\nconcluded, \"NW Mint stored, generated, disposed, or otherwise released\n\nhazardous materials on the premises, in breach of Section 11 [of] the Lease.\" It\n\nalso concluded, \"NW Mint failed to notify Auburn of the release of hazardous\n\n\n       17 Auburn contends that NW Mint's brief fails to comply with RAP 10.3.\nBecause the nature of Auburn's challenges are clear, Auburn shows no prejudice\nfrom any alleged violation, and RAP 1.2 requires us to interpret these rules\nliberally to promote justice and facilitate the decision of cases on the merits, we\nwaive any technical violations of RAP 10.3.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/16\n\n\n\nwaste at the Auburn Property in breach of Section 11 of the Lease.\" Additionally,\n\nit concluded, \"Auburn provided NW Mint notice and a reasonable opportunity to\n\ncomply with measures that Auburn deemed advisable to protect its interest in the\n\nAuburn Property. NW Mint failed to undertake any appropriate or meaningful\n\nremedial action.\"   NW Mint breached section 13 \"by failing to maintain the\n\npremises in good order and repair at the time ofsurrender on April 30, 2010.\"\n\n       NW Mint claims, \"Before the Lease terminated in 2010, Auburn never\n\nobjected to NW Mint's use of metals such as silver, copper and nickel in its\nmanufacturing processes. Auburn never claimed that NW Mint's operations\n\nbreached Section 11 of the Lease.\"       It asserts that the trial court \"erred in\n\nconcluding that the mere presence of metallic dust in the Premises constituted a\nbreach of Section 11 of the Lease\" because \"Auburn did not introduce any\n\nevidence that the residual metallic dust, which was in the Premises at lawful, de\n\nminimus [sic] levels, presented a threat to human health or the environment.\"\n       The record shows that NW Mint \"store[d], generate^], dispose[d] of or\n\notherwise allow[ed] the release of any hazardous waste released hazardous\n\nmaterials\" on the premises and did not notify Auburn of these releases. The trial\ncourt found, \"Hazardous substance metal fumes, dust and residues were\n\ndispersed throughout the facility and were also released to the 'environment,' as\nevidenced by high levels of hazardous substance metal dust/residue found\noutside of the building, both on the roof and on the loading dock area outside of\n\nthe building.\"\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/17\n\n\n\n      Although NW Mint assigns error to the court's conclusion that \"[t]he metal\n\ndust/residue, including arsenic, chromium, lead, selenium, silver, copper, nickel,\n\nand zinc, at the Auburn Property are hazardous substances as defined by\n\nMTCA/CERCLA,\" it does not support this assignment of error with any argument.\n\nIf a party fails to support an assignment of error with legal arguments, we do not\nconsider them on appeal.18         The lease prohibited any storage, generation,\n\ndisposal, or other releases of hazardous materials, regardless of whether the\n\nreleases posed a risk to human health or the environment. NW Mint fails to\n\nestablish its compliance with section 11 of the lease.\n\n          NW Mint also breached the lease because it did not maintain the premises\n\nin \"neat, clean and in good order, repair and in a sanitary condition,\" as section\n\n13 required.      NW Mint rejected Auburn's requests to clean the premises to\n\nenable Auburn to relet it to a new tenant.              Even if NW Mint \"quit and\n\nsurrendered] the Premises ... in a neat and broom clean condition,\" these\n\nviolations were sufficient to constitute a breach of both section 11 and section 13.\n\n          NW Mint also challenges its liability under the MTCA. RCW 70.105D.080\n\nstates,\n\n          Except as provided in RCW 70.105D.040(4)(d) and (f), a person\n          may bring a private right of action, including a claim for contribution\n          or for declaratory relief, against any other person liable under RCW\n          70.105D.040 for the recovery of remedial action costs.

NW Mint identifies no costs recoverable\n\nunder the MTCA that are not recoverable under the lease.       Because we affirm\n\nNW Mint's liability under the lease, we do not address MTCA's applicability to this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n        Finally, NW Mint makes four challenges to the trial court's supplemental\n\njudgment and order awarding attorney fees and costs. First, NW Mint claims that\n\nthe court \"abused its discretion by accepting Auburn's billing statements without\n\nquestion and failing to deduct for wasteful and duplicative work.\" Second, NW\nMint contends, \"The trial court abused its discretion by failing to segregate the\n\ntime related to Auburn's unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.\"          Third, it\n\nalleges, \"Auburn's attorneys spent unnecessary time on post-judgment matters,\n\nincluding the Fee Motion.\" Fourth, NW Mint asserts, \"The trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by awarding Auburn every penny of its claimed $425,767.28 in costs.\"\n\n        The trial court awarded $425,767.28 in litigation expenses, $1,116,279.33\n\nin attorney fees, and $50,000.00 in \"[f]ees/costs for December 2012 through\nentry of supplemental judgment.\" Its award also included a $10,000.00 credit for\na security deposit. The court concluded, \"The evidence supports a full award of\nall of Auburn's 'remedial action' legal expenses under MTCA and its attorneys'\n\n\n        21 Former RCW 70.105D.020(5).\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/20\n\n\n\nfees and costs under the 2002 Lease based on both the traditional 'lodestar'\n\nanalysis and an 'equitable factors' analysis.\"\n\n       Generally, Washington courts apply the lodestar method to calculate\n\nattorney fees.22   The court awarding attorney fees makes an independent\n\ndetermination about the reasonableness of the fees requested.23          The fee\n\napplicant bears the burden of establishing that a fee is reasonable.24\n       To apply the lodestar method, the court considers first the number of\n\nhours reasonably expended on the matter.25 \"'[T]he attorneys must provide\n\nreasonable documentation of the work performed.'\"26 This documentation must\n\ninclude at least (1) the number of hours worked, (2) the type of work performed,\n\nand (3) the category of attorney who performed the work.27 The court does not\n\nneed to conduct an hour-by-hour analysis of each lawyer's time sheets, so long\n\nas the court provides a consideration of the relevant factors and reasons\n\n\n\n\n      22 Mahler v.

The court also has made a reduction for duplicative\n        efforts at trial.   It was not necessary to have four partner level\n        lawyers present at the entire trial, particularly due to the fact that\n        one lawyer never made any oral representation to the court and the\n        other lawyer's participation was limited to questioning two\n        witnesses on the first day of trial. The presence of these attorneys\n        was unnecessarily duplicative.          Given that there were two\n        experienced lawyers already representing Auburn at trial, the court\n        does not find it necessary that Mr. Johnson was present for trial or\n        that Mr. Hamell remained after his witnesses testified on the first\n        day of trial. The court will reduce the award for their trial time. Mr.\n        Johnson billed approximately 104 hours at $33,800, and Mr. Hamell\n        billed 104 hours at $30,680.\n                10.    Defendants argued that other time was duplicative as\n        well. The court does not find this defense argument convincing.\n        This case was aggressively litigated by the Defendants and Auburn\n        had the right to respond in kind. The communication between\n        plaintiff's counsels was reasonable and not excessive. The court\n        finds that plaintiff's counsels reasonably allocated their resources\n        for their motions practice and depositions. Finally, the court finds\n        that the costs requested are appropriate given the broad definition\n        of costs in MTCA claims.\n\n\n\n        35 NW Mint does not challenge the hourly fees of Auburn's attorneys.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/23\n\n\n             11.    Aside from the specific reductions discussed above,\n      the evidence established that Auburn's counsel expended a\n      reasonable number of hours in representing Auburn with respect to\n      Auburn's \"remedial action\" responses to the contamination caused\n      by Defendants, and in achieving a successful litigation result to\n      resolve Auburn's claims under MTCA and under the 2002 Lease.\n             12.    As evidenced by the detailed documentation provided\n      by Auburn, the hours billed by Auburn's counsel as part of the\n      remedial action and in the course of the litigation of the MTCA and\n      the 2002 Lease claims were not wasteful or duplicative.\n\n      NW Mint fails to cite any controlling authority in challenging the amount of\n\ncommunications among Auburn's attorneys or any authority showing that the\n\nentries were improperly vague. NW Mint also cites no authority establishing that\n\nhaving multiple attorneys review pleadings and documents is improper. Further,\n\nalthough NW Mint claims that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding\n\nmore than $27,000 in fees when only one of the two attorneys who attended\n\ndepositions and hearings for Auburn actually represented Auburn, it fails to\n\nindicate which specific entries that it is challenging.36 Therefore, NW Mint fails to\n\nshow that the trial court awarded fees for duplicative work.\n\n       NW Mint also alleges that the trial court failed to exclude the requested\n\nfees and costs related to Auburn's unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.37 It\n\nargues that because the fact pattern for this claim was unrelated to the fact\npattern for the contamination claim, the court \"abused its discretion by\n\n\n\n\n       36 NW Mint cites a declaration offering expert opinion on Auburn's cost\nand fee application, but the entries included in that document do not total\n$27,000.\n      37 Section 14 of the lease required NW Mint to remove all of its\nimprovements that Auburn requested itto remove.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/24\n\n\n\n\nunquestioningly accepting Auburn's unsupported estimate of the time its\n\nattorneys spent on the unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.\"\n\n      A trial court need not segregate attorney fees when it finds that claims are\n\n\"so related that no reasonable segregation of successful and unsuccessful claims\n\ncan be made.\"38 The trial court found,\n\n      Auburn was unsuccessful in its tenant improvement claim and the\n      award should be reduced for the hours expended on that claim.\n      The tenant improvement claim constituted a minimal amount of\n      work however, and there are limited invoices that are applicable to\n       it. . . . The court finds that the invoices were sufficient to determine\n      the work performed in this lawsuit. Much of the testimony provided\n      and the work performed regarding the tenant improvement claim\n      related to Auburn's other property damage and contamination\n      claims; hence, the claims were inextricably intertwined. The tenant\n      improvement claim itself was simply a very minor part of the\n       litigation. Nevertheless, a reduction is necessary and the court\n       accepts the 100 hour estimate proffered by the Plaintiff totaling\n       approximately $37,000 in reduction as reasonable and frankly,\n       perhaps generous.\n\n       The court rejected NW Mint's argument that it was impossible to\n\ndetermine the number of hours expended on the tenant improvement claim. NW\n\nMint cites no evidence indicating that the tenant improvement claim rested on a\n\ndifferent common core of facts than the contamination claim. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n       NW Mint also contests the fees awarded for \"post-judgment matters,\n\nincluding the Fee Motion.\" It challenges the court's order denying NW Mint's\nmotion to strike declarations and exhibits supporting Auburn's motion for attorney\n\nfees and costs or to continue the fee hearing. In its motion, NW Mint claimed\n\n       38 Hume v.Am. Disposal Co., 124 Wn.2d 656, 673, 880 P.2d 988 (1994).\n\n                                         -24-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/25\n\n\n\n\nthat declarations and attached documents filed with Auburn's reply in support of\n\nits motion for attorney fees and costs constituted \"new evidence\" that NW Mint\n\ndid not have adequate time to analyze.           The trial court relied upon this\n\nchallenged evidence when it determined that Auburn's fee request was\n\nreasonable.\n\n\n      We will reverse a trial court's denial of a continuance only upon a showing\n\nof both an abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice.39        NW Mint cites no\n\nspecific billing record to support its contention. The evidence submitted with\n\nAuburn's reply raised no new issues; it simply rebutted the arguments made in\n\nNW Mint's response to Auburn's motion for attorney fees and costs.40\n\nAdditionally, Auburn provided many of the documents to NW Mint previously.\n\nWe reject NW Mint's arguments.\n\n       Finally, NW Mint claims that Auburn was not entitled to recover deposition\n\nexpenses, daily transcription charges, travel costs for parties, lay witness travel\n\ncosts, support staff overtime, computer management software, copying charges,\n\nand meal expenses during trial. The lease's attorney fee and cost provision\n\nentitles Auburn to recover \"its attorney's fees, statutory court costs, and all other\n\nlitigation costs and expenses expended or incurred in connection with [an action\n\n       39 State v.

Because NW Mint identifies no\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/2\n\n\n\ncosts recoverable under the MTCA that are not recoverable under the lease, we\n\ndo not decide if the MTCA applies to this case.

We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n\n          NW Mint is a full service mint that fabricates coins and other metallic\n\nitems. In May 2002, Ross Hansen, d/b/a/ Northwest Territorial Mint, signed a six-\n\nyear agreement with MegaWest LLC to lease suite 101 of a commercial-\nindustrial property.1 The building was new when this lease began, and Ross\nHansen, d/b/a/ Northwest Territorial Mint, was the first tenant in suite 101. In\n\nJuly 2007, MegaWest sold the building and assigned its interest in the lease to\nAuburn. NW Mint occupied the premises and was a tenant under the lease from\n\nDecember 31, 2002, until April 30, 2010, when the lease ended.\n\n          Section 11 of the lease stated,\n\n\n      1 In December 2002, Hansen formed Northwest Territorial Mint LLC, which\nwas not a party to this lease agreement. The trial court concluded,\n          Northwest Territorial Mint, LLC was acting as a Tenant under the\n          Lease and as an operator of the mint business at the Auburn\n          property from December 31, 2001 through the end of NW Mint's\n          lease in April of 2010. NW Mint's operations at the Auburn property\n          were held out to the public as operations of Northwest Territorial\n          Mint, LLC. Northwest Territorial Mint, LLC succeeded to enough of\n          Hansen's rights and obligations under the Lease to be considered a\n          Tenant under the Lease. At a minimum, Northwest Territorial Mint,\n          LLC occupied the leased premises as its principal place of business\n          and made all of the monthly Lease payments to Auburn from 2007\n          until the end of the Lease.\nThe premises leased is located in an area zoned as M-1, which permits uses\nincluding \"residential, daycare, preschools, nursery schools, health and fitness\n clubs, restaurants, and other uses.\"\n\n                                            -2-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/3\n\n\n\n     HAZARDOUS WASTE. Tenant shall not store, generate, dispose\n     of or otherwise allow the release of any hazardous waste or\n     materials in, on or under the Premises, Property or Project or any\n     adjacent property, or in any improvements placed on the Premises.\n     Except as otherwise provided, Tenant represents and warrants to\n     Landlord that Tenant's intended use of the Premises does not\n     involve the use, production, disposal or bringing on to the Premises\n     of any Hazardous Waste. As used herein, the term \"Hazardous\n     Waste\" includes any substance, waste or material defined or\n     designated as hazardous, toxic or dangerous (or any similar term)\n     by any federal, state or local statute, regulation, rule or ordinance\n      now or hereafter in effect, including, but not limited to, the\n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\n     Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601, or the Washington Model Toxics\n     Control Act (\"MTCA\"), RCW 70.105D.010 et seq. Tenant shall\n     promptly comply with all statutes, regulations and ordinances, and\n      with all orders, decrees or judgments of governmental authorities or\n      courts having jurisdiction, relating to the use, collection, treatment,\n      disposal, storage, control, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Waste\n      in, on or under the Premises or any adjacent property, or\n      incorporated in any improvements, at Tenant's expense.            After\n      notice to Tenant and a reasonable opportunity for Tenant to effect\n      such, Landlord may, but is not obligated to, enter upon the\n      Premises and take such actions and incur such costs and\n      expenses to effect such compliance as it deems advisable to\n      protect its interest in the Premises; provided, however, that\n      Landlord shall not be obligated to give Tenant notice and an\n      opportunity to effect such compliance if (i) such delay might result\n      in material adverse damage to Landlord or the Property, (ii) Tenant\n      has already had actual knowledge of the situation and a reasonable\n      opportunity to effect such compliance, or (iii) an emergency exists.\n      Whether or not Tenant has actual knowledge of the release of\n      Hazardous Waste on the Premises or Property or any adjacent\n      property as the result of Tenant's use ofthe Premises, Tenant shall\n      reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord\n      in connection with such compliance activities. Tenant shall notify\n      Landlord immediately of any release of any Hazardous Waste in,\n      on, under or from the Premises, Property or Project. Tenant shall\n      indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord against any and all\n      losses, liabilities, suits, obligations, fines, damages, judgments,\n      penalties, claims, charges, cleanup costs, remedial actions, costs\n      and expenses (including, without limitation, consultant fees,\n      attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be imposed on,\n      incurred or paid by, or asserted against Landlord or the Premises,\n      Property or Project by reason of, or in connection with (i) any\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/4\n\n\n      misrepresentation, breach of warranty or other default by Tenant\n      under this Lease, or (ii) the acts or omissions by Tenant under this\n      Lease, or (iii) the acts or omissions of Tenant, or any sublessee or\n      other person for whom Tenant would otherwise be liable, resulting\n      in the release of any Hazardous Waste. This indemnity and\n      Tenant's other duties under this paragraph 11 shall survive the\n      termination of this Lease.\n\nSection 13 of the lease stated,\n\n      Tenant will at all times during the Term keep the Premises and all\n      systems therein and the doors and windows thereof neat, clean and\n      in good order, repair and in a sanitary condition. . . . Except for\n       reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire or unavoidable\n       casualty, Tenant will at all times preserve the Premises in as good\n       repair as they are now or may hereafter be put to. All repairs shall\n      be at Tenant's sole cost and expense, except for repairs required\n      for the outside roof, exterior walls and foundation which shall be\n       Landlord's responsibility. Tenant will, at all times, cause the\n       Premises to comply with all ordinances, regulations, rules or orders\n       of every governmental entity undertaking jurisdiction over the\n       Premises.\n\nThis provision also stated, \"Tenant agrees that at the expiration or sooner\n\ntermination of this Lease, Tenant will quit and surrender the Premises without\n\nnotice, and in a neat and broom clean condition.\" The lease also contained the\n\nfollowing attorney fee and cost provision:\n\n       If Landlord employs an attorney or if Landlord brings suit to recover\n       any rent due hereunder, or for breach of any other provision of this\n       Lease . . . , Landlord shall be awarded its attorney's fees, statutory\n       court costs, and all other litigation costs and expenses expended or\n       incurred in connection with such action and in any appellate or\n       collection proceedings. All sums due from Tenant to Landlord shall\n       bear interest at the Default Interest rate.\n\n       In June 2007, before purchasing the property, Auburn hired EBI\n\nConsulting to perform a phase Ienvironmental site assessment ofthe building. A\nphase I environmental site assessment report informs a potential purchaser or\nlender if the property contains or likely contains any recognized environmental\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/5\n\n\n\n\nconditions—any hazardous substances on a property under conditions that\n\nindicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of\n\nany hazardous substances into structures on the property or into the ground,\n\ngroundwater, or surface water of the property.            Recognized environmental\n\nconditions include hazardous substances under conditions in compliance with\n\nlaws but do not include de minimis conditions. Because a phase I environmental\n\nsite assessment is a screening tool to determine if any recognized environmental\n\nconditions warrant additional investigation, it does not include any actual\n\nsampling.    A phase I environmental site assessment also affords its user the\n\nability to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner,\n\ncontiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on\n\nliability   under    the   federal    Comprehensive      Environmental      Response,\n\nCompensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. § 9601, as well as the\n\nMTCA. Federal standards govern these assessments.\n\n        EBI's phase I environmental site assessment report noted that NW Mint\n\nused the property to produce commemorative coins. NW Mint used machinery\n\nand equipment including presses, stamps, and saws, and it used a commercial-\n\ngrade soap to polish the coins. EBI's report identified no evidence of recognized\n\nenvironmental       conditions   or   evidence   of   leaks,   staining,   or   obvious\n\naccumulations of metal dust.2 EBI's assessment did not include interviews with\n\n\n\n      2 At trial, a representative from EBI testified, \"And in the context of those\nconcentrations being relatively high concentrations in our sampling, for example,\nwe would be—that amount would be spread out over a square foot. So the\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/6\n\n\n\nany individuals from NW Mint. It also did not include inspections of HV/AC,\nheating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems, or of roof areas. Auburn relied\non EBI's phase Ienvironmental site assessment when it purchased the property.3\n       In May 2010, after the lease ended, Auburn hired EBI to survey the entire\ncondition of the premises.        This survey included an industrial hygiene\nassessment to allow Auburn \"to be sure that the property was safe for lease in an\n\nunrestricted manner to any particular type of tenant that they could attract to the\nproperty.\" EBI's survey did not include a human health risk assessment. If\ncontamination levels in collected samples were below EBI's own surface\ncontamination limits, EBI would certify the facility as clean and certify that a\n\ntenant could occupy the premises without restrictions or limitations.\n       In its \"Site Cleanliness Investigation Report,\" EBI determined that based\non its own surface contamination limits, the premises was \"grossly contaminated\nwith toxic metal dusts, fines, and process residuals.\"4            EBI found, \"All\n\nability to observe that is very limited.\" He also testified that EBI only later\n became aware that NW Mint conducted industrial processes on the premises,\nsuch as furnaces for melting metal, locations for pouring melted metal into molds,\n blasting operations, and electroplating.\n        3 The trial court concluded that Auburn undertook all appropriate inquiry\n into the previous ownership and uses of the premises consistent with good\n commercial practice.\n      4 In this report, EBI stated,\n       There are currently no regulatory limits addressing surface\n       contamination for industrial type settings, so EBI has developed\n       surface contamination limits based on regulatory daily intake and\n        exposure limits. If the contaminant concentration is less than these\n        developed surface limits, EBI is willing to confirm that the surfaces\n        are clean and that the facility is clean/free of hazardous toxic\n        contamination. However, all of the five (5) composite samples had\n        sufficient contamination to indicate that the facility is contaminated\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/7\n\n\n\nmanufacturing areas greatly exceed the limits for silver, selenium, and copper.\n\nAdditionally, at least one area exceeds the limit for each of the following toxic\n\nmetals: Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, cobalt, manganese, nickel and zinc.\"\n\nEBI concluded, \"Inhalation of the toxic metal dusts or skin contact of settled dust\n\ncould have significant harmful health effects.\" Further, \"[a]ny settled dusts or\n\nmetal fines would likely be listed or characterized as a regulated hazardous\n\nwaste.\"      EBI recommended that workers properly trained in exposure to\n\nhazardous substances clean the facility.\n\n       Before receiving EBI's report, Auburn did not believe that NW Mint\n\nreleased hazardous substances at the premises. Auburn shared the report with\n\nNW Mint and included a letter stating,\n\n                    Pursuant to, among others Sections ... 11 (\"Hazardous\n       Waste\"), 13 (\"Maintenance and Repairs; Redelivery\")... of the\n       Lease, we are affording your client the opportunity under the Lease\n       to take steps to remediate the contamination of the premises.\n       Action needs to be taken to bring contaminant levels down to safe\n       levels within the parameters of the specifications in the enclosed\n          report.\n\n          EBI issued a \"Lease Space Move Out Survey\" in June 2010 after\n\ninspecting the physical condition of the premises. In its report, EBI noted that\nHansen would not allow photographs of the building's interior and would not\n\nprovide answers about his business or manufacturing processes.            EBI was\n\n          with a number of toxic metals and should not be leased or occupied\n          without further cleaning and decontamination.\nAt trial, a representative from EBI testified, \"We used our approach, and if\nsomebody had offered a scientifically based actual alternative to cleaning up the\nproperty, that we could have ... had a dialogue on, we were more than happy to\ndo that. That never happened.\"\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/8\n\n\n\nunable to access the roof. EBI shared this survey with NW Mint and enclosed a\n\nletter stating, \"EBI Consulting has concluded that Ross Hansen did not properly\nmaintain the premises nor return the premises in good working condition as\n\nrequired under the terms of the Lease.\"\n\n      Auburn established a deadline of June 1, 2010, for NW Mint \"to agree to\n\nassume full responsibility for clean-up of the premises to a condition meeting the\n\nterms of the lease and satisfactory to EBI Consulting, such that the landlord is in\n\na position to safely market this space and to have that clean-up done\nimmediately.\" NW Mint hired AMEC, an environmental consultant, to review\nEBI's report. Before allowing AMEC to inspect the property, Auburn initially\ninsisted that NW Mint agree to responsibility for \"whatever clean-up that is\n\ndetermined by the experts needs to be done.\" NW Mint declined. In response to\nNW Mint's renewed request to access the premises, Auburn wrote a letter\n\nstating,\n\n       Because [Hansen] had been equivocal in prior communications\n       regarding your client as liable for this contamination, we believed it\n       would be an act of good faith on your client's part to acknowledge\n       his responsibility for such contamination, and that doing so would\n       facilitate better cooperation between the parties and a common\n       purpose to addressing and remediating the contamination,\n       especially given your client's lack of cooperation with the owner in\n       the past.[5]\n       AMEC completed its review of EBI's report in June 2010.                  AMEC\nconcluded, \"It is the opinion of AMEC that the EBI's methodology and approach\n\n\n           5Auburn ultimately permitted industrial hygienist Elisabeth Black to access\n the premises and conduct sampling.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/9\n\n\n\nare flawed and cannot be relied upon to determine whether there is a potential\n\nhealth risk to occupants of the building.\" It noted, \"AMEC has not established\n\nclean-up criteria for this facility at this time, but we would certainly use different\n\nmethodology to do so.\" It also stated, \"Further investigation is needed, and they\n\nmay conclude that there are areas that need to be cleaned up.\"\n\n       In June 2010, industrial hygienist Elisabeth Black developed a proposal for\n\nNW Mint \"to facilitate the removal of settled dust and metals.\" She expressed \"no\n\nreason to believe that the EBI results weren't accurate.\" Black \"took issue with,\n\nperhaps, their sampling method and clean-up criteria they established, but from\nmy perspective, in counseling my client, it seemed like going to clean-up was\n\nlikely the simplest option.\" NW Mint rejected Black's proposal.\n\n       In August 2010, Black presented NW Mint with a proposal to identify the\n\nlevels of metals and surface dust on the premises. Auburn's expert, Stephen\n\nFrost, accompanied Black as she sampled the premises and took side-by-side\n\nsamples.\n\n       In November 2010, Black issued a report concluding, based on a limited\n\namount of information, that the premises posed a potential hazard. Black also\n\nstated in her report, \"Whether or not this condition creates an adverse health\nimpact to a future tenant of the building cannot be determined based on available\ninformation.\"   She noted that the elevated samples were not attributable to\n\n background contamination from natural and human sources—these samples\nexceeded background levels. And she found that the metal concentrations and\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/10\n\n\n\ntypes of metals were unusual.6        Black recommended that an \"experienced\nabatement firm with training in hazardous waste operations\" conduct a \"thorough\n\ncleaning\" \"according to a protocol prepared by a certified industrial hygienist.\"\n\n       Auburn hired Clean Harbors to clean the premises. EBI oversaw Clean\n\nHarbors' remediation, which took place from January through October 2011.\n\nClean Harbors cleaned the premises according to EBI's contamination limits.\n\n       In October 2011, EBI issued to Auburn a certification letter confirming that\n\nfuture tenants could use suite 101 without restrictions or limitations attributable to\n\nhazardous metals.           In March 2012, EBI issued a \"Facility Cleaning &\n\nDecontamination Certification and        Environmental Closure Report,\" which\n\ndocumented the investigation and remediation work in suite 101.\n\n       In 2009, Auburn sued Hansen for breach of contract, seeking injunctive\n\nrelief and damages arising out of a dispute about access to an electrical room,\n\nphone room, and common areas of the premises. In 2010, Auburn sued NW\nMint, asserting breach of contract claims arising under the lease and a claim to\nrecover \"remedial action costs\" under RCW 70.105D.080. Auburn claimed that\n\nNW Mint breached the lease by contaminating the building with hazardous\n\n       6 Black testified,\n       [T]his is not a condition you would typically encounter, either in\n       types of metals or concentrations of metals. It is unusual because\n       we rarely ever get metals and surface dust values for an industrial\n       facility, it is type sampling that's fairly rare, unless it is directed at\n       lead, for which there are standards; it is not typically done.\n       Unusual, because I think, as I have said before, it puts the land\n       owner or properties owner in a condition that was going to require\n        some action to move forward and make that space leasable for\n        unrestricted use.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/11\n\n\n\n\nsubstances, as defined by federal and state law, by damaging the building in\n\nexcess of normal wear and tear, and by failing to remove tenant improvements.\n\nAuburn alleged over $1.3 million in damages. On February 11, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt consolidated these cases.\n\n       In January 2012, Auburn hired toxicology expert John Schell to conduct a\n\nhuman health risk assessment of the leased premises—a quantitative evaluation\n\nof risk.7   Schell testified at trial that a \"cleanup level\" under the MTCA is a\n\nprotective level that is safe for human health. He concluded that the levels of\n\narsenic, chromium-VI, copper, and selenium exceeded the MTCA cleanup\n\nstandards.8    Schell testified that before Clean Harbors cleaned the premises,\n\n\"Based on my calculations of a risk based cleanup level, some of those metals,\n\nthe concentrations in the dust, posed a potential health threat.\"\n\n        In June 2012, NW Mint applied to the Washington State Department of\n\nEcology's Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP).9             The Department of Ecology\n\n(Ecology) rejected NW Mint's application, reasoning,\n\n        We did not accept your application because the release you\n        reported does not constitute a hazardous waste site requiring\n        remedial action under the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA),\n\n        7 Schell testified that \"risk is a function of both the toxicity of the material\nand the dose that is received.\"\n      8 Schell relied upon a bulk dust sample analysis that Stephen Frost\nconducted, which determined the concentrations of constituent metals. Schell\nnoted that using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's calculation\nmethod, the levels of silver also exceeded the cleanup standard.\n      9 The VCP supports independent cleanup actions. It allows owners and\noperators of contaminated sites to enter into an agreement with the Department\nof Ecology to review cleanup-related documents and to issue opinions about\ncompliance with the MTCA.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/12\n\n\n      Chapter 70.105D RCW. This opinion is based on an analysis of\n      whether there has been a \"release\" into the \"environment\" of a\n      \"hazardous substance\" as defined by MTCA, Chapter 70.105D\n      RCW, and its implementing regulations, Chapter 173-340 WAC.\n\n\n\n      Documents provided to Ecology state that areas within the building\n      contain dust composed of silver, selenium, copper, arsenic,\n      cadmium, chromium, lead, cobalt, manganese, nickel and zinc.\n\n       From the documents provided, metal dust did not enter the\n      \"environment\". Rather, the dust was contained within the building.\n\n      This opinion is regarding the administrative and technical\n      requirements of MTCA, and is not an opinion regarding whether\n      other local, state or federal requirements may apply to the facility.\n\n       In July 2012, NW Mint filed a second application to the VCP.           This\n\napplication was not different materially from NW Mint's first application. Ecology\n\nrejected this application, reasoning,\n\n       We did not accept your application because the data provided to\n       Ecology is insufficient to show a release into the environment of a\n       hazardous substance.      This decision is based on an analysis of\n       whether there has been a \"release\" into the \"environment\" of a\n       \"hazardous substance\" as defined by MTCA, Chapter 70.105D\n       RCW, and its implementing regulations, Chapter 173-340\n       WAC. . . . Ecology makes no determination as to whether there is a\n       threatened release of a hazardous substance.         The VCP is not\n       designed for review of remedial actions related solely to a\n       threatened release.\n\n\n\n\n       Documents provided to Ecology state that areas within the building\n       contain dust composed of silver, selenium, copper, arsenic,\n       cadmium, chromium, lead, cobalt, manganese, nickel and zinc\n       (collectively \"metals dust\"). Ecology received no sampling data of\n       surface water, ground water, drinking water supply, land surface or\n       subsurface strata, or ambient air. If such data is provided, you may\n       reapply to enter the VCP.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/13\n\n\n      This decision is regarding whether Ecology will accept your\n      application to enter the VCP. This decision is not an opinion\n      regarding whether other local, state or federal requirements may\n      apply to the facility. This decision does not determine whether any\n      independent remedial action performed at the facility is the\n      substantial equivalent of an Ecology-conducted or Ecology-\n      supervised remedial action. Such determinations are made by a\n      court. See RCW 70.105D.080. The state, Ecology and its officers\n      and employees are immune from all liability, and no cause of action\n      of any nature may arise from any act or omission in providing this\n      informal advice and assistance. See RCW 70.105D.030(1)(i).\n\n      On October 15, 2012, the trial court entered 155 findings of fact, 31\n\nconclusions of law. The court concluded that Hansen and Northwest Territorial\n\nMint LLC were \"strictly liable, jointly and severally, for all remedial action costs\n\nincurred by Auburn at the Auburn property.\" On November 14, 2012, the trial\ncourt entered an order granting in part and denying in part Auburn's motion to\n\namend these findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a judgment in\n\nfavor of Auiburn.10 In the judgment, the court awarded to Auburn $869,746.53 in\n\nremedial action costs under the MTCA and damages for NW Mint's breach of the\n\nlease. The court also awarded attorney fees and costs to Auburn under the\n\nMTCA and the lease.\n\n       On June 4, 2013, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment and\n\norder awarding $1,582,046.61 in costs and attorney fees to Auburn.\n\n       NW Mint appeals.\n\n\n\n\n       10   The court removed legal fees from Auburn's remedial action costs,\nreducing the calculation from $657,818.68 to $391,573.23. NW Mint does not\nappeal this order.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/14\n\n\n\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n      We review challenged findings of fact by examining if substantial evidence\n\nsupports the findings and if the findings in turn support the conclusions of law.11\n\nSubstantial evidence exists if it is sufficient to persuade a fair-minded, rational\n\nperson of the truth of the matter asserted.12 Unchallenged findings of fact are\n\nverities on appeal.13 A trial court's interpretation of contract language presents\n\nan issue of law that we review de novo.14\n\n      We review the legal basis for an attorney fee award de novo but review\n\nthe reasonableness of the award amount for abuse of discretion.15 A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on\n\nuntenable grounds.16\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n\n       NW Mint raises three issues.

As a result, we do not need to reach NW Mint's MTCA\n\nclaim.17\n\n       NW Mint makes three challenges to its liability under the lease. First, NW\n\nMint claims that \"the residual metals NW Mint left at the Premises did not present\n\na risk of actual harm to human health or the environment.\" Second, it alleges,\n\n\"NW Mint complied with all statutes, regulations and orders concerning\n\nhazardous wastes.\"    Third, NW Mint asserts, \"NW Mint left the Premises in a\n\n'broom clean' condition, which is the Lease's only cleanup standard.\" We reject\n\nthese contentions.\n\n\n       The trial court found, \"Section 13 of the Lease applies to the physical\n\ncondition of Suite 101, and the 'broom clean' specification in Section 13 does not\n\nmodify or supersede the requirements of Section 11 of the Lease regarding\n\nhazardous substances.\" It also found, \"NW Mint did not cooperate with Auburn's\n\ninvestigation and cleanup of the contamination in 2010 and 2011.\" The court\n\nconcluded, \"NW Mint stored, generated, disposed, or otherwise released\n\nhazardous materials on the premises, in breach of Section 11 [of] the Lease.\" It\n\nalso concluded, \"NW Mint failed to notify Auburn of the release of hazardous\n\n\n       17 Auburn contends that NW Mint's brief fails to comply with RAP 10.3.\nBecause the nature of Auburn's challenges are clear, Auburn shows no prejudice\nfrom any alleged violation, and RAP 1.2 requires us to interpret these rules\nliberally to promote justice and facilitate the decision of cases on the merits, we\nwaive any technical violations of RAP 10.3.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/16\n\n\n\nwaste at the Auburn Property in breach of Section 11 of the Lease.\" Additionally,\n\nit concluded, \"Auburn provided NW Mint notice and a reasonable opportunity to\n\ncomply with measures that Auburn deemed advisable to protect its interest in the\n\nAuburn Property. NW Mint failed to undertake any appropriate or meaningful\n\nremedial action.\"   NW Mint breached section 13 \"by failing to maintain the\n\npremises in good order and repair at the time ofsurrender on April 30, 2010.\"\n\n       NW Mint claims, \"Before the Lease terminated in 2010, Auburn never\n\nobjected to NW Mint's use of metals such as silver, copper and nickel in its\nmanufacturing processes. Auburn never claimed that NW Mint's operations\n\nbreached Section 11 of the Lease.\"       It asserts that the trial court \"erred in\n\nconcluding that the mere presence of metallic dust in the Premises constituted a\nbreach of Section 11 of the Lease\" because \"Auburn did not introduce any\n\nevidence that the residual metallic dust, which was in the Premises at lawful, de\n\nminimus [sic] levels, presented a threat to human health or the environment.\"\n       The record shows that NW Mint \"store[d], generate^], dispose[d] of or\n\notherwise allow[ed] the release of any hazardous waste released hazardous\n\nmaterials\" on the premises and did not notify Auburn of these releases. The trial\ncourt found, \"Hazardous substance metal fumes, dust and residues were\n\ndispersed throughout the facility and were also released to the 'environment,' as\nevidenced by high levels of hazardous substance metal dust/residue found\noutside of the building, both on the roof and on the loading dock area outside of\n\nthe building.\"\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/17\n\n\n\n      Although NW Mint assigns error to the court's conclusion that \"[t]he metal\n\ndust/residue, including arsenic, chromium, lead, selenium, silver, copper, nickel,\n\nand zinc, at the Auburn Property are hazardous substances as defined by\n\nMTCA/CERCLA,\" it does not support this assignment of error with any argument.\n\nIf a party fails to support an assignment of error with legal arguments, we do not\nconsider them on appeal.18         The lease prohibited any storage, generation,\n\ndisposal, or other releases of hazardous materials, regardless of whether the\n\nreleases posed a risk to human health or the environment. NW Mint fails to\n\nestablish its compliance with section 11 of the lease.\n\n          NW Mint also breached the lease because it did not maintain the premises\n\nin \"neat, clean and in good order, repair and in a sanitary condition,\" as section\n\n13 required.      NW Mint rejected Auburn's requests to clean the premises to\n\nenable Auburn to relet it to a new tenant.              Even if NW Mint \"quit and\n\nsurrendered] the Premises ... in a neat and broom clean condition,\" these\n\nviolations were sufficient to constitute a breach of both section 11 and section 13.\n\n          NW Mint also challenges its liability under the MTCA.

NW Mint identifies no costs recoverable\n\nunder the MTCA that are not recoverable under the lease.       Because we affirm\n\nNW Mint's liability under the lease, we do not address MTCA's applicability to this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n        Finally, NW Mint makes four challenges to the trial court's supplemental\n\njudgment and order awarding attorney fees and costs. First, NW Mint claims that\n\nthe court \"abused its discretion by accepting Auburn's billing statements without\n\nquestion and failing to deduct for wasteful and duplicative work.\" Second, NW\nMint contends, \"The trial court abused its discretion by failing to segregate the\n\ntime related to Auburn's unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.\"          Third, it\n\nalleges, \"Auburn's attorneys spent unnecessary time on post-judgment matters,\n\nincluding the Fee Motion.\" Fourth, NW Mint asserts, \"The trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by awarding Auburn every penny of its claimed $425,767.28 in costs.\"\n\n        The trial court awarded $425,767.28 in litigation expenses, $1,116,279.33\n\nin attorney fees, and $50,000.00 in \"[f]ees/costs for December 2012 through\nentry of supplemental judgment.\" Its award also included a $10,000.00 credit for\na security deposit. The court concluded, \"The evidence supports a full award of\nall of Auburn's 'remedial action' legal expenses under MTCA and its attorneys'\n\n\n        21 Former RCW 70.105D.020(5).\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/20\n\n\n\nfees and costs under the 2002 Lease based on both the traditional 'lodestar'\n\nanalysis and an 'equitable factors' analysis.\"\n\n       Generally, Washington courts apply the lodestar method to calculate\n\nattorney fees.22   The court awarding attorney fees makes an independent\n\ndetermination about the reasonableness of the fees requested.23          The fee\n\napplicant bears the burden of establishing that a fee is reasonable.24\n       To apply the lodestar method, the court considers first the number of\n\nhours reasonably expended on the matter.25 \"'[T]he attorneys must provide\n\nreasonable documentation of the work performed.'\"26 This documentation must\n\ninclude at least (1) the number of hours worked, (2) the type of work performed,\n\nand (3) the category of attorney who performed the work.27 The court does not\n\nneed to conduct an hour-by-hour analysis of each lawyer's time sheets, so long\n\nas the court provides a consideration of the relevant factors and reasons\n\n\n\n\n      22 Mahler v.

The attorneys\n\nrepresenting all parties were very experienced and produced exceptional work.\"35\n\nThe court concluded, \"The hours expended and hourly rates charged by\n\nAuburn's counsel as 'remedial action' attorneys' fees in this case were\n\nreasonable.\"\n\n\n        NW Mint claims that the trial court awarded fees for duplicative work,\n\nincluding \"[e]xcessive contacts between Auburn's counsel,\" \"[duplication of effort\n\nin reviewing pleadings and documents,\" and \"[duplication of effort in conducting\n\ndepositions or attending hearings.\" The court entered the following findings of\n\nfact:\n\n\n               9.      The court also has made a reduction for duplicative\n        efforts at trial.   It was not necessary to have four partner level\n        lawyers present at the entire trial, particularly due to the fact that\n        one lawyer never made any oral representation to the court and the\n        other lawyer's participation was limited to questioning two\n        witnesses on the first day of trial. The presence of these attorneys\n        was unnecessarily duplicative.          Given that there were two\n        experienced lawyers already representing Auburn at trial, the court\n        does not find it necessary that Mr. Johnson was present for trial or\n        that Mr. Hamell remained after his witnesses testified on the first\n        day of trial. The court will reduce the award for their trial time. Mr.\n        Johnson billed approximately 104 hours at $33,800, and Mr. Hamell\n        billed 104 hours at $30,680.\n                10.    Defendants argued that other time was duplicative as\n        well. The court does not find this defense argument convincing.\n        This case was aggressively litigated by the Defendants and Auburn\n        had the right to respond in kind. The communication between\n        plaintiff's counsels was reasonable and not excessive. The court\n        finds that plaintiff's counsels reasonably allocated their resources\n        for their motions practice and depositions. Finally, the court finds\n        that the costs requested are appropriate given the broad definition\n        of costs in MTCA claims.\n\n\n\n        35 NW Mint does not challenge the hourly fees of Auburn's attorneys.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/23\n\n\n             11.    Aside from the specific reductions discussed above,\n      the evidence established that Auburn's counsel expended a\n      reasonable number of hours in representing Auburn with respect to\n      Auburn's \"remedial action\" responses to the contamination caused\n      by Defendants, and in achieving a successful litigation result to\n      resolve Auburn's claims under MTCA and under the 2002 Lease.\n             12.    As evidenced by the detailed documentation provided\n      by Auburn, the hours billed by Auburn's counsel as part of the\n      remedial action and in the course of the litigation of the MTCA and\n      the 2002 Lease claims were not wasteful or duplicative.\n\n      NW Mint fails to cite any controlling authority in challenging the amount of\n\ncommunications among Auburn's attorneys or any authority showing that the\n\nentries were improperly vague. NW Mint also cites no authority establishing that\n\nhaving multiple attorneys review pleadings and documents is improper. Further,\n\nalthough NW Mint claims that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding\n\nmore than $27,000 in fees when only one of the two attorneys who attended\n\ndepositions and hearings for Auburn actually represented Auburn, it fails to\n\nindicate which specific entries that it is challenging.36 Therefore, NW Mint fails to\n\nshow that the trial court awarded fees for duplicative work.\n\n       NW Mint also alleges that the trial court failed to exclude the requested\n\nfees and costs related to Auburn's unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.37 It\n\nargues that because the fact pattern for this claim was unrelated to the fact\npattern for the contamination claim, the court \"abused its discretion by\n\n\n\n\n       36 NW Mint cites a declaration offering expert opinion on Auburn's cost\nand fee application, but the entries included in that document do not total\n$27,000.\n      37 Section 14 of the lease required NW Mint to remove all of its\nimprovements that Auburn requested itto remove.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/24\n\n\n\n\nunquestioningly accepting Auburn's unsupported estimate of the time its\n\nattorneys spent on the unsuccessful tenant improvement claim.\"\n\n      A trial court need not segregate attorney fees when it finds that claims are\n\n\"so related that no reasonable segregation of successful and unsuccessful claims\n\ncan be made.\"38 The trial court found,\n\n      Auburn was unsuccessful in its tenant improvement claim and the\n      award should be reduced for the hours expended on that claim.\n      The tenant improvement claim constituted a minimal amount of\n      work however, and there are limited invoices that are applicable to\n       it. . . . The court finds that the invoices were sufficient to determine\n      the work performed in this lawsuit. Much of the testimony provided\n      and the work performed regarding the tenant improvement claim\n      related to Auburn's other property damage and contamination\n      claims; hence, the claims were inextricably intertwined. The tenant\n      improvement claim itself was simply a very minor part of the\n       litigation. Nevertheless, a reduction is necessary and the court\n       accepts the 100 hour estimate proffered by the Plaintiff totaling\n       approximately $37,000 in reduction as reasonable and frankly,\n       perhaps generous.\n\n       The court rejected NW Mint's argument that it was impossible to\n\ndetermine the number of hours expended on the tenant improvement claim. NW\n\nMint cites no evidence indicating that the tenant improvement claim rested on a\n\ndifferent common core of facts than the contamination claim. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n       NW Mint also contests the fees awarded for \"post-judgment matters,\n\nincluding the Fee Motion.\" It challenges the court's order denying NW Mint's\nmotion to strike declarations and exhibits supporting Auburn's motion for attorney\n\nfees and costs or to continue the fee hearing.

Because Auburn prevails in\n\nthis appeal, it is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs under RAP 18.1,\n\nRCW 4.84.330, and the lease.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings, which support its\n\nconclusions that NW Mint breached its lease with Auburn. NW Mint fails to show\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded Auburn all of its fees and\n\ncosts under the lease. We do not reach the applicability of the MTCA to this\n\n\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fNO. 69568-1-1/27\n\n\n\n\ncase.
