(\"National\") brings this interlocutory appeal\r\nchallenging the trial court's order certifying a class action.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.\r\nยง 51.014(a)(3) (West Supp. 2002).  National contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\ncertifying the class because the appellee, Ella Mae Rowe, failed to satisfy certain requirements for\r\nclass certification under rule 42 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  We will affirm the trial\r\ncourt's order certifying the class.<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><center>BACKGROUND</center></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis case concerns child riders to life insurance policies sold by National.  National\r\nbegan selling child riders in 1965.  Rowe purchased her life insurance policy with a child rider from\r\nNational in 1977.  Since National began selling these riders, the forms of the child riders have been\r\naltered.<sup> (1)</sup>  However, all forms of the rider that lie at the center of this controversy contain substantially\r\nsimilar language.  Each rider provides for a $1,000 benefit to be paid upon the death of a child prior\r\nto termination of coverage for that child at age twenty-five.  The rider defines \"child\" as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\"Child\" as used in this rider means (1) each of the Insured's children who is named\r\nin the application for this rider, who is at least 15 days old, and who at the date of\r\napplication is not yet 18 years old, and (2) each child born to or legally adopted by\r\nthe Insured and Insured's spouse after the date of application for this rider, who\r\nbecomes 15 days old and who at the date of adoption is not yet 18 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>National does not maintain records of the insured's children and does not require notice upon the\r\nbirth or adoption of additional children after the child rider is purchased.  National simply promises\r\nto provide the $1,000 benefit upon receipt of \"due proof of death of a child.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe rider also contains the following language concerning termination of coverage:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Insurance on a Child stops on the rider anniversary when the Child is 25 years old\r\nunless it stops earlier in accordance with this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Premiums are not due for this rider after it has stopped.  If we accept a premium after\r\ntermination it does not mean that we are liable for benefits under this rider or that we\r\nwaive the termination.  We will refund any premiums so accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>National drafted these riders so that coverage terminates once the policyholder's children have\r\nreached twenty-five years of age.  However, because National recognized that it may continue to\r\nreceive rider premiums after coverage terminates, the rider disclaims liability for benefits if\r\npremiums are received and accepted after coverage terminates.  Although the rider promises a refund\r\nof premiums so accepted, National has not offered to refund the premiums collected from unnamed\r\nclass members that were remitted after coverage terminated.<sup> (2)</sup>  It is National's failure to refund\r\npremiums paid after a child turns twenty-five that forms the basis for this class action litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe termination language in the rider lies at the heart of this dispute.  Rowe alleges\r\nthat National has wrongfully continued to collect premiums for riders under which the coverage has\r\nterminated.  Policyholders do not receive a copy of the rider until after the first premium payment\r\nis received by National.  Therefore, policyholders have already initiated payment for the rider before\r\nhaving the opportunity to review the contractual language to which they have agreed.  Furthermore,\r\nRowe claims that National designed that language to place an affirmative duty on the policyholder\r\nto recognize when the rider has expired.  Rowe claims that National designed the riders in this\r\nmanner with an understanding that individuals would not recognize the nuances of this language, and\r\nthus, would likely continue to pay premiums for riders that had terminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAdditionally, Rowe argues that National is in the best position to monitor its\r\npolicyholders' rider coverage and should assume the obligation of notifying policyholders if they\r\nremit premiums that are no longer due.  Rowe further contends that National's billing policies\r\nconfuse policyholders and manipulate them into paying for terminated riders, in that National\r\nsubmits premium invoices to policyholders that fail to segregate the two premiums, one for the\r\nunderlying policy and one for the rider.  National concedes that on policies that are in effect for ten\r\nor twenty years, policyholders may forget that their premiums include payments for the rider.  Rowe\r\nargues that National should notify its policyholders about the status and charges concerning the\r\nriders.  Therefore, Rowe filed suit in March 2000 asserting claims against National for breach of\r\ncontract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Deceptive\r\nTrade Practices-Consumer Protection Act and article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nBus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. ยง 17.41 (West 2002); Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21 (West Supp. 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational responds that it should not be responsible for notifying policyholders when\r\ncoverage terminates on the rider because National has no way of knowing the ages of children\r\ncovered by the rider.  National does not maintain records of the names and ages of its policyholders'\r\nchildren.  Nor does National require notice if additional children come under the rider's umbrella\r\nof coverage.  Because National does not maintain such records, National claims that it cannot be\r\nexpected to know the number or ages of covered children.  National's second defense to Rowe's\r\nallegations is that the riders are designed to provide continuing coverage regardless of whether\r\npolicyholders have children under twenty-five when premiums are paid.  National argues that some\r\npolicyholders choose to continue paying for the rider to ensure that any after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren are covered.  National asserts, <em>inter alia</em>, that the class certification is improper because the\r\ntrial court ignored National's argument based on this continuing benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational raises eight issues in its appeal.  In its first issue, National attacks the trial\r\nplan on grounds that it relies on a flawed claim form procedure and it eliminates or lowers Rowe's\r\nburden of proof concerning reliance and National's statute of limitations defense.  In its fifth and\r\nsixth issues, National also challenges the trial plan as arbitrarily placing Rowe's breach of contract\r\nclaims ahead of the remaining tort claims and failing to consider a section of the insurance code.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Ins. Code Ann. ยง 36.159(c) (West 2002) (governing Texas Department of Insurance subpoena\r\npowers and duty to protect confidentiality of privileged records).  National's second issue challenges\r\nthe trial court's finding that the class met the commonality requirement of rule 42(a)(2).  Issues three\r\nand four challenge the trial court's determination that Texas law governs all the claims of the class. \r\nBy its seventh issue, National asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting expert\r\ntestimony in the certification hearing without properly examining it for relevance and reliability. \r\nFinally, National's eighth issue challenges the trial court's order requiring National to bear a portion\r\nof the discovery costs in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn a class action, the trial court is charged with the duty of actively policing the\r\nproceedings and guarding the class interests.  <em>See General Motors Corp. v. Bloyed</em>, 916 S.W.2d 949,\r\n954 (Tex. 1995) (discussing extraordinary nature of class action litigation, protections required for\r\nabsent class members, and trial court's departure from ordinarily detached role assumed in most\r\nother proceedings).  Therefore, the trial court is afforded broad discretion in defining the class and\r\ndetermining whether to grant or deny a class certification.  <em>See Intratex Gas Co. v. Beeson</em>, 22\r\nS.W.3d 398, 406 (Tex. 2000).  On appeal, our review is strictly limited to determining whether the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in ordering class certification.  <em>See Tana Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Bates</em>,\r\n978 S.W.2d 735, 740 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, no pet.); <em>Vinson v. Texas Commerce Bank-Houston,\r\nN.A.</em>, 880 S.W.2d 820, 823 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1994, no writ).  An appellate court must not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the trial court.  <em>Tana Oil</em>, 978 S.W.2d at 740.  Even if a trial court\r\ndetermines an issue differently than would an appellate court, the ruling does not necessarily\r\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.  <em>Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc.</em>, 701 S.W.2d 238, 242\r\n(Tex. 1985); <em>see also Vinson</em>, 880 S.W.2d at 824.  In determining whether a matter should be\r\nlitigated as a class action, a trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is arbitrary, unreasonable,\r\nor without reference to any guiding principles.<em>  Tana Oil</em>, 978 S.W.2d at 740.  Further, a trial court\r\nabuses its discretion if it does not properly apply the law to the undisputed facts, but does not abuse\r\nits discretion if it bases its decision on conflicting evidence.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Vinson</em>, 880 S.W.2d at 823.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn making its class certification decision, the trial court can consider the pleadings\r\nand other material in the record, along with the evidence presented at the hearing.  <em>Employers Cas.\r\nCo. v. Texas Ass'n of Sch. Bds. Workers' Comp. Self-Ins. Fund</em>, 886 S.W.2d 470, 474 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1994, writ dism'd w.o.j.).  The evidence on which a trial court bases its certification\r\nruling need not be in a form necessary to be admissible at trial.<em>  See Texas Commerce Bank Nat'l\r\nAss'n v. Wood</em>, 994 S.W.2d 796, 801 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.);\r\n<em>Microsoft Corp. v. Manning</em>, 914 S.W.2d 602, 615 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1995, writ dism'd).  We\r\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's action, entertaining every\r\npresumption that favors its judgment.  <em>Vinson</em>, 880 S.W.2d at 823; <em>see also</em> <em>Brittian v. General Tel.\r\nCo.</em>, 533 S.W.2d 886, 889 (Tex. Civ. App.--Fort Worth 1976, writ dism'd) (citing <em>Richardson v.\r\nKelly</em>, 191 S.W.2d 857 (Tex. 1945)).  After such a review, we will reverse a district court's decision\r\nto certify a class only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion in light of the evidence\r\npresented in the certification hearing, or that it applied incorrect legal standards in reaching its\r\ndecision.<em>  See Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC</em>, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing\r\n<em>Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co.</em>, 994 F.2d 1101, 1104-05 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Jenkins v. Raymark Indus.</em>, 782\r\nF.2d 468, 471-72 (5th Cir. 1986)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn conducting the initial evidentiary review, the trial court must conduct a rigorous\r\nanalysis to determine whether all prerequisites have been met before ruling on class certification. \r\n<em>Southwestern Ref. Co., Inc. v. Bernal,</em> 22 S.W.3d 425, 435 (Tex. 2000).  Noting that courts, prior to\r\nits decision in <em>Bernal</em>, were certifying class actions without conducting the proper analysis into each\r\nrequirement of rule 42, notably section (b)(4) of the rule, the Texas Supreme Court expressly rejected\r\nan \"approach of certify now and worry later.\"  <em>Id.</em>  While some have incorrectly interpreted the\r\nsupreme court's language as establishing a <em>de novo</em> standard of review for class certification, we are\r\nmindful of the remainder of the court's discussion.  <em>Bernal</em> clearly instructs that the trial court\r\ncontinues to enjoy discretion in making a class certification decision.  However, the trial court must\r\nadhere to the rule's requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Although it may not be an abuse of discretion to certify a class that could later fail,\r\nwe conclude that a cautious approach to class certification is essential.  The\r\n\"flexibility\" of Rule 42 \"enhances the usefulness of the class-action device, [but]\r\nactual, not presumed, conformance with [the Rule] remains . . . indispensable.\" \r\n<em>Falcon</em>, 457 U.S. at 160.  As the Supreme Court stressed in <em>Amchem</em>: \"Courts must\r\nbe mindful that the rule as now composed sets the requirements they are bound to\r\nenforce. . . .  The text of a rule . . . limits judicial inventiveness.\"  <em>Amchem Prods.\r\nInc.</em>, 521 U.S. at 620; <em>see also General Motors Corp. v. Bloyed</em>, 916 S.W.2d 949, 954\r\n(Tex. 1996) (emphasizing \"the importance of the trial court's obligation to determine\r\nthat the protective requirements of Texas Rule 42 are met\").</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>Bernal</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 435.  Our commitment to <em>stare decisis</em> concerning the standard of review in\r\nclass action certification cases must recognize the concerns created by the class action landscape\r\nbefore <em>Bernal</em> while maintaining a grasp on the rationale behind that standard and the reasons for the\r\n\"flexibility of rule 42.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(c)(1) (trial court may alter, amend, or withdraw class\r\ncertification order at any time before final judgment).  Rule 42(c)(1) provides the trial court with the\r\ntools needed to respond to changes in the case's development.  <em>Intratex</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 407 (appellate\r\ncourt must remand when it identifies definitional problem in class certification order because\r\nprescribing proper definition is committed to trial court's discretion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOur review of the record in this case supports our conclusion that the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in certifying the class.  The trial court conducted a thorough certification\r\nhearing in which it went beyond the parties' pleadings in order to examine the claims, defenses,\r\nrelevant facts, and applicable substantive law of this case in order to make a meaningful\r\ndetermination of the certification issues.  The record before us indicates that the trial court conducted\r\na rigorous analysis of all issues presented and arrived at a cautious decision in certifying the class. \r\nThe clerk's record, combined with the first, second, and third supplemental clerk's records, consists\r\nof approximately 2,800 pages of pleadings and documentary evidence.  Additionally, the record\r\ncontains a multiple volume reporter's record.  At the certification hearing, Rowe presented one\r\nwitness, deposition excerpts from five witnesses, four affidavits from both expert and non-expert\r\nwitnesses, as well as discovery responses and other documentary evidence.  National followed by\r\npresenting three live witnesses, four affidavits, its expert witness's report, portions of a deposition,\r\nand additional documentary evidence.  At the conclusion of the certification process, the trial court\r\ndecided to certify the class.  The extensive and detailed certification order, findings of fact, and\r\nconclusions of law demonstrate that the trial court conducted a rigorous review of the information\r\npresented and determined that this case met the <em>Bernal </em>test of actual, rather than merely presumed,\r\ncompliance with the requirements of rule 42.  We are convinced that the trial court made an\r\ninformed, cautious, and proper decision that common issues predominated over individual issues,\r\nand that all issues in this case could be considered in a manageable, time-efficient, and fair manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFinally, we must not lose sight of the fact that class action certification is a trial court\r\ndecision made at the very inception of the litigation process.  One of the reasons we accord the abuse\r\nof discretion standard to the trial court is that such issues as trial plan, the management of the\r\ndiscovery process, and a litany of other factors of necessity will have only been determined as a\r\npreliminary matter when class certification is addressed by the trial court.  During the course and\r\ndevelopment of a class action, trial courts may need to alter, amend, or modify the original class\r\ncertification order. <em> See, e.g.</em>,<em> De Los Santos v. Occidental Chem. Corp.</em>, 933 S.W.2d 493, 494 (Tex.\r\n1996) (certification of class originally granted as mandatory class, changed to opt-in class during\r\npretrial discovery period, and returned to mandatory class after initial phase of trial); <em>Wood v.\r\nVictoria Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A.</em>, 69 S.W.3d 235, 237 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.)\r\n(holding trial court acted within its discretion in decertifying class);<em> Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Fry</em>,\r\n27 S.W.3d 573, 589 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2000, pet. denied) (remanding to trial court to\r\ndetermine whether establishment of sub-classes can cure definitional problem in original certification\r\norder);<em> Pierce Mortuary Colls., Inc. v. Bjerke</em>, 841 S.W.2d 878, 879 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1992, writ\r\ndenied) (trial court amended certification order, expanding class to include additional group of\r\nindividuals and adding two years to time period in which injury could have occurred).  Cases such\r\nas these demonstrate how the management of class actions can warrant changes to the original\r\ncertification order and why appellate courts must employ an abuse of discretion standard in ruling\r\non challenges to the granting or denial of class certification.  Indeed, the whole process of class\r\naction certification presupposes the changing nature of the litigation process and gives the trial court\r\nample authority to shape the litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>REQUIREMENTS OF CLASS CERTIFICATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tRule 42, governing class actions, is patterned after its federal counterpart. \r\nConsequently, federal decisions and authorities interpreting current federal class action requirements\r\nare persuasive authority.  <em>Bernal,</em> 22 S.W.3d at 433.  The class action serves as a mechanism to\r\neliminate or reduce the threat of repetitive litigation, prevent inconsistent resolution of similar cases,\r\nand provide a means of redress for individual claims that are too small to make independent actions\r\neconomically viable.  <em>See Ford Motor Co. v. Sheldon</em>, 22 S.W.3d 444, 452 (Tex. 2000).  The\r\nprincipal purpose of the class action device is efficiency and economy of litigation.  <em>See id.</em>\r\n(discussing origins and general design of class action device).  Thus, when properly used, a class\r\naction saves the court's and the parties' resources by allowing class-wide issues to be tried in an\r\neconomical fashion.  <em>See id.</em> at 452 (citing <em>General Tel. Co. v. Falcon</em>, 457 U.S. 147, 155 (1981)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAll class actions must satisfy the following four threshold requirements: (1)\r\nnumerosity--the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2)\r\ncommonality--there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) typicality--the claims or\r\ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4)\r\nadequacy of representation--the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests\r\nof the class.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(a);<em> Bernal</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 433.  In addition to these prerequisites,\r\nclass actions must satisfy at least one of four subdivisions of rule 42(b).  Here, the trial court found\r\nthat Rowe established that this class action satisfies rule 42(b)(4), which requires questions of law\r\nor fact common to the class to predominate over questions affecting only individual members and\r\nthat class treatment be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\r\nthe controversy.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(b)(4); <em>see also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor</em>, 521 U.S. 591,\r\n615 (1997); <em>Bernal</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 433.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Trial Plan</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational challenges the trial court's order granting class certification on the grounds\r\nthat the requirements of rule 42 have not been satisfied.  National's most significant challenge\r\nattacks the trial court's proposed trial plan.  The trial plan specifies that the class in this case will be\r\nan opt-out class.  Also, in order to determine which class members had after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren, the trial court intends to attach a Proof of Additional Children form to the notice sent to all\r\nclass members.  This form will be filled out and returned by the class members.  Class members who\r\nhave additional children who are still under twenty-five years of age may, by this process, exclude\r\nthemselves from the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFurthermore, the notice will provide an opportunity to verify whether there is a way\r\nto know the ages of children listed on a policyholder's application and which child rider form\r\nnumber applies to each class member without requiring a manual review of National's files.  But if\r\na manual review is required, then National must pay the expenses of conducting the review and\r\npreparing the results.  The court found this allocation of expenses fair in light of the fact that Rowe's\r\ncounsel is mailing out the notice and Proof of Additional Children forms at its expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan also addresses various discovery needs.  The notice and Proof of\r\nAdditional Children forms will ask class members whether they have had after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren since the rider was purchased.  Because National has indicated that it may want to depose\r\nor otherwise obtain discovery from every class member, the trial plan states that an adequate time\r\nfor such discovery will be allowed, but that the trial court may streamline the discovery to ensure that\r\nit is not overly burdensome.  The trial court also explains that it will entertain a no-evidence motion\r\nfor summary judgment as to all class members where no evidence has been obtained of after-born\r\nor after-adopted children.  If Rowe carries the burden of proof on this issue, the trial plan calls for\r\nproof of claim forms to be issued during the damages phase of the trial.  Those class members with\r\nchildren under twenty-five years of age would then be allowed to exclude themselves from the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan also calls for a single jury to try this case in two phases.  The first phase\r\nwill determine liability and damages.  The court anticipates that most of the damages calculation will\r\nbe presented through expert testimony and that the jury could, after hearing such evidence, decide\r\nany disputes about whether a class member did in fact have after-born or after-adopted children. \r\nHowever, the trial plan anticipates that this issue may be decided either by stipulation or by partial\r\nsummary judgment.  The second phase would address punitive damages if the jury verdict from the\r\nfirst phase justifies such a submission.  After the trial, the court will hold a hearing on the entry of\r\njudgment which would allocate any undivided damages awards to the class members.  Finally, the\r\ntrial plan addresses National's statute of limitations defense and finds that a trial of that issue would\r\nbe manageable and that the submission of a fraudulent concealment and a discovery rule question\r\nto the jury would allow relief to be awarded only to those class members who fall within the statute\r\nof limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational claims that the trial plan's attempt to expedite the resolution of individual\r\nissues alters the parties' burdens, deprives National of the ability to attack Rowe's case, and unduly\r\nrestricts it from presenting viable defenses.  <em>See Bernal</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 435.  National's most vocal\r\nobjection to the plan focuses on the Proof of Additional Children form procedure.  National believes\r\nthat the trial court, through the use of the Proof of Additional Children form, has created a\r\npresumption favoring the class.  This alleged presumption, National contends, shifts the burden of\r\nproving the absence of after-born or after-adopted away from the individual class members and\r\ntowards National.  National contends that the trial plan allows for a class member to prove damages\r\nmerely by remaining silent about whether additional children exist.  National carries its argument\r\nto a conclusion that this presumption will adversely affect National in a final damages calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHowever, National's argument ignores both the preliminary nature of this trial plan\r\nas well as the uncertainty surrounding the development of the litigation.  The trial plan does not say\r\nthat the Proof of Additional Children forms or the evidence obtained from them will be admissible\r\nat trial.  The only clear inference that can be drawn from the trial plan is that the Proof of Additional\r\nChildren forms serve as the initial discovery tool employed by the trial court.  In fact, the trial court\r\nanticipated that the forms might not be returned or that further information might be needed in order\r\nfor National to present a defense.  Therefore, the court specifically referenced the possible need for\r\nadditional discovery, albeit in a streamlined manner due to the numerosity of the class, in order to\r\nobtain information favorable to National's defense.  Thus, the trial plan anticipates the need to\r\nprovide National the opportunity to develop its defense based on the fact that certain individuals may\r\nhave continued paying premiums in reliance on National's promise to preserve coverage for\r\nadditional children.  Accordingly, we conclude that the trial plan does not preclude National from\r\ndeveloping its defense.  The discovery methods outlined in the trial plan protect each party's\r\nopportunity to adequately and vigorously present any material claims and defenses.  <em>Bernal</em>, 22\r\nS.W.3d at 437.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational next attacks the trial plan on the issue of reliance.  Focusing on Rowe's\r\nallegations concerning the DTPA, the insurance code, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation,\r\nNational argues that the trial court has eliminated Rowe's burden of proving reliance.  However, we\r\nnote initially that the trial court began its focus with the breach of contract claims that apply\r\nuniformly to all class members.  Reliance is not required to prove a breach of contract.  <em>See Wright\r\nv. Christian &amp; Smith</em>, 950 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no pet.) (\"The\r\nelements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) performance or\r\ntendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages\r\nto the plaintiff resulting from that breach.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAs to the non-contract claims alleged in Rowe's petition, the trial court has not\r\neliminated reliance from consideration in this case.  The trial court's order states that the presumed\r\ndirection of the trial on these non-contract claims will focus on the uniform conduct of National, its\r\nbilling policies, and its failure to refund <em>any</em> premiums paid for terminated riders.  The trial court also\r\ndetermined that some claims do not require a showing of reliance.  If various class members have\r\nactually had or planned to have additional children after their youngest child attained twenty-five\r\nyears of age, reliance becomes a substantive issue only for those discrete claims.  The discovery tools\r\nemployed in this case will determine whether reliance is a substantial issue, but until the end of the\r\ndiscovery period, the trial court's discretion should not be disturbed merely on the <em>speculation</em> that\r\na specific issue might arise that could be detrimental to a <em>portion</em> of the class.  We recognize that the\r\ntrial court may decertify or reshape the class to address issues such as reliance.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n42(c)(1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's next challenge to the trial plan concerns its statute of limitations defense. \r\nThe applicable statute of limitations in this case is two years for the tort causes of action and four\r\nyears for the breach of contract claims.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยงยง 16.003, .051 (West\r\n1997 &amp; Supp. 2002).  To survive the limitations defense, Rowe has pleaded both the discovery rule\r\nand fraudulent concealment.  The discovery rule operates to defer accrual of a cause of action until\r\nthe plaintiff knows or, by exercising reasonable diligence, should know of the facts giving rise to the\r\nclaim.  <em>Wagner &amp; Brown, Ltd. v. Horwood</em>, 58 S.W.3d 732, 734 (Tex. 2001).  A plaintiff may rely\r\non the discovery rule only when the nature of the injury is both inherently undiscoverable and\r\nobjectively verifiable.  <em>Id</em>.  Fraudulent concealment estops the defendant from relying on the statute\r\nof limitations as an affirmative defense.  <em>Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.</em>, 918 S.W.2d 453,\r\n456 (Tex. 1996).  Whether a plaintiff knew or should have known of an injury is generally a question\r\nof fact for the jury.  <em>Houston Endowment Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co.</em>, 972 S.W.2d 156, 160 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no writ).  National correctly asserts that the discovery rule and\r\nfraudulent concealment may require proof of each individual class member's subjective knowledge\r\nconcerning discovery of the injury alleged.  However, National misinterprets the trial court's plan\r\nfor determining this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan proposes to submit a question to the jury on fraudulent concealment and\r\nthe discovery rule so that the jury may determine when a reasonable policyholder had met the test\r\nfor either means of overcoming National's limitations defense.  National reads this proposal as\r\nlowering Rowe's burden from showing each class member's subjective knowledge to simply\r\nshowing when a reasonable person should have known.  National's interpretation incorrectly\r\nassumes that the jury will decide whether class members may overcome the limitations defense.  The\r\ntrial plan merely proposes to have the jury try these discrete issues and determine a date or time when\r\nthe injuries became discoverable.  The trial plan clearly states that this proposed course can\r\neffectively manage this issue because Rowe proposes to try this issue based on theories of breach\r\nof contract and National's uniform conduct in designing the riders, failing to refund payments, and\r\ncontinuing to bill for expired riders.  Therefore, we conclude that at this preliminary stage, the trial\r\ncourt has not lowered Rowe's burden.  The trial plan anticipates that the discovery process will\r\nproduce information from each class member regarding when that person first had sufficient\r\nknowledge of the injuries alleged in this lawsuit.  The trial court may then apply the discovery results\r\nto the jury's finding and determine which class members' claims fail as a result of limitations.  Thus,\r\nthe trial plan proposes a way to manage the trial of this issue and does not lower Rowe's burden in\r\novercoming National's affirmative defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's final two challenges to the trial plan also fail to persuade us that the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion.  Without providing any authority, National claims that the trial court\r\nerred in determining that the breach of contract claim was the primary claim asserted by Rowe.  The\r\ntrial court has discretion in managing this litigation.  Tex R. Civ. P. 42(c)(1).  The trial court's\r\ncharacterization of its preliminary determinations concerning the management of this case cannot\r\nbe said to have amounted to an abuse of discretion.  National's final attack on the trial plan relies on\r\nTexas Insurance Code section 36.159(c).  This section of the code deals with the general subpoena\r\npowers of the Texas Department of Insurance and does not have any effect on the parties to this\r\nlitigation.  Having dismissed these final two issues, and having determined that the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in devising the trial plan for this case, we overrule National's first, second,\r\nfifth, and sixth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Commonality</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough National phrases its second issue as challenging the trial court's\r\ndetermination that common issues predominated over individual issues, it fails to brief an argument\r\nrelating to the rule's predominance requirement.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(b)(4).  Therefore, National\r\nappears to have waived any challenge to the predominance requirement.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P.\r\n38.1(h).  However, because National properly raises a challenge to the trial court's finding of\r\ncommonality, we will address both commonality and predominance as a single issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tRule 42(a)(2) does not require that all or even a substantial portion of the legal and\r\nfactual questions be common to the class.  <em>Nissan Motor Co. v. Fry</em>, 27 S.W.3d at 588.  It requires\r\nonly that <em>some</em> legal or factual questions be common to the class.  <em>Rainbow Group, Ltd. v. Johnson</em>,\r\n990 S.W.2d 351, 358 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).  The commonality requirement\r\nmeans that an issue of law or fact exists that inheres in the complaints of all the class members. \r\n<em>Entex v. City of Pearland</em>, 990 S.W.2d 904, 919 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.). \r\nQuestions common to the class are those which, when answered as to one class member, are\r\nanswered as to all class members.  <em>Nissan Motor Co.</em>, 27 S.W.3d at 588.  The common issues may\r\nbe those of law or fact; there need not be common issues of both law and fact, and a <em>single</em> common\r\nquestion may provide sufficient grounds for class certification.  <em>Id</em>.  The commonality requirement\r\nis generally considered satisfied where (1) many members of the class are subject to the same\r\nmisrepresentation or omissions by reason of common documents, or (2) the defendant is alleged to\r\nhave engaged in a common course of conduct.  <em>Rio Grande Valley Gas Co. v. City of Pharr</em>, 962\r\nS.W.2d 631, 643 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1997, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court found that Rowe had established commonality because each child rider\r\ncontains substantially similar language in the termination clauses and the claims of the class focus\r\nlargely on this language.<sup> (3)</sup>  Rowe further established commonality by demonstrating that the class will\r\ntry the case based on the uniform breach, or anticipatory breach, of contract based on National's\r\ndesign and implementation of the riders.  Additionally, the trial court found that National's uniform\r\nconduct in billing and collecting premiums on these riders created common issues with regard to\r\nRowe's tort claims.  Finally, the trial court summarized its commonality determination into four\r\nquestions focusing on (1) whether the riders are ambiguous, (2) whether National's uniform conduct\r\namounted to a breach of the rider contracts, (3) whether National engaged in tortious conduct by its\r\nuniform billing policy and failure to refund premiums paid after termination, and (4) whether the\r\nclass is entitled to a constructive trust because of National's conduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational challenges the trial court's findings as being \"too general to satisfy the\r\ncommonality requirement because each simply restates the causes of action.\"  In support of this\r\nproposition, National cites <em>Kelley v. Galveston Autoplex</em>, 196 F.R.D. 471, 475 (S.D. Tex. 2000).<sup> (4)</sup> \r\nHowever, in <em>Kelley</em>, the federal district court did not find commonality because the alleged violations\r\ntook many different forms.  The court indicated that in order for certification to be proper, the\r\ncontracts in issue would have had to be \"a single type of contract that is virtually, if not completely,\r\nidentical in each transaction.\"  <em>Id</em>. (quoting <em>Durrett v. John Deere Co.</em>, 150 F.R.D. 555, 557 (N.D.\r\nTex. 1993)).  Here, each class member entered into an agreement for insurance coverage using\r\nvirtually identical contracts issued by National.  Furthermore, National's alleged tortious conduct\r\nwas uniform for every class member.  Therefore, because National engaged in a common course of\r\nconduct and entered into agreements with each class member based on virtually identical documents,\r\nwe cannot say that the trial court's initial determination that the commonality requirement had been\r\nsatisfied was an abuse of discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Choice of Law</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court made an initial determination to apply Texas law in this class action\r\nlitigation.  Which state's law governs an issue is a question of law for the court to decide. \r\n<em>Torrington Co. v. Stutzman</em>, 46 S.W.3d 829, 848 (Tex. 2000) (citing <em>Hughes Wood Prods., Inc. v.\r\nWagner</em>, 18 S.W.3d 202, 204 (Tex. 2000)).  But determining the state contacts to be considered by\r\nthe court in making this legal determination involves a factual inquiry.  <em>Hughes</em>, 18 S.W.3d at 204. \r\nTexas courts apply the Restatement's \"most significant relationship\" test to decide choice-of-law\r\nissues.  <em>Torrington</em>, 46 S.W.3d at 848; Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยงยง 6, 145, 188, 192\r\n(1971).  Section 6 of the Restatement lists the following general factors used to decide a choice-of-law question:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the needs of the interstate and international systems,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the relevant policies of the forum,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those\r\nstates in the determination of the particular issue,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the protection of justified expectations,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 6(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn addition to applying the principles enumerated in section 6, we must also refer to\r\nsections 145 and 188 because Rowe's causes of action encompass both tort and contract claims. \r\nSection 145 contains the following factual matters to be considered when applying these principles\r\nto a tort case: (a) the place where the injury occurred; (b) the place where the conduct causing the\r\ninjury occurred; (c) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business\r\nof the parties; and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nยง 145(2).  Under section 188 of the Restatement, we determine contractual rights and duties by the\r\nlaw of the state with the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.  <em>Minnesota\r\nMining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Nishika Ltd.</em>, 953 S.W.2d 733, 735-36 (Tex. 1997); Restatement (Second) of\r\nConflict of Laws ยง 188(1).  When, as here, the parties have not expressly chosen the applicable law,\r\nwe consider the following contacts in determining which law governs their controversy: (a) the place\r\nof contracting; (b) the place of negotiation; (c) the place of performance; (d) the location of the\r\ncontract's subject matter; and (e) the parties' domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation,\r\nand place of business.  Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 188(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough National is domiciled in Colorado, it does not maintain any offices or\r\nemployees in Colorado, and its principal place of business and administrative offices are located in\r\nAustin, Texas.  National maintains all contact with policyholders from its Austin offices, it transmits\r\ncorrespondence containing the billing notices from Austin, and it receives all premium payments in\r\nAustin.  Furthermore, all of the child riders at issue in this case were designed in Texas, and all\r\nconduct allegedly causing injury to the class members in both contract and tort occurred as a result\r\nof National's activities in Texas.  While only twenty-seven percent of the riders purchased by class\r\nmembers were sold in Texas, every class member maintained direct contact with Texas in originally\r\npurchasing the rider and paying premiums.  Additionally, National's obligations of performance for\r\nany claims made under the rider occurred in Texas.  Applying these considerations to the list of\r\nfactors in sections 188 and 145 of the Restatement, the choice to use Texas law appears proper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational attempts to overcome this strong indication that Texas law should apply by \r\narguing that section 192 of the Restatement requires that the law of the individual insured's state\r\nshould apply.  Section 192 states:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The validity of a life insurance contract issued to the insured upon his application and\r\nthe rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an effective choice of law\r\nby the insured in his application, by the local law of the state where the insured was\r\ndomiciled at the time the policy was applied for, unless, with respect to the particular\r\nissue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated\r\nin ยง 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state\r\nwill be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 192.  National focuses solely on the first part of this\r\nsection.  The general rule espoused by section 192 is not applicable in this case.  Rather, we must\r\nlook to the exception found in this section for guidance because of the facts and surrounding\r\nprocedural concerns of this case.  Because we believe that Texas \"has a more significant relationship\r\nunder the principles stated in section 6\" to this case, section 192's rule favoring application of the\r\nlaw of the insured's state does not apply. <em> Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe basic principles of section 6 favor the application of Texas law.  It is reasonable\r\nto assume that National expected Texas law to apply to its actions in contracting for, billing, and\r\ncollecting premiums for its riders.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(d) (protection of justified expectations).  With a\r\nlarge number of class members having purchased their riders in Texas and the action having been\r\nfiled in Texas, the ease of determination and application factor favors Texas law.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(g)\r\n(ease in determination and application of law to be applied).  In a class action such as this one, with\r\na single defendant located in one forum and a large number of class members scattered throughout\r\nforty-one states, the desire for certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result weigh heavily toward\r\napplication of Texas law.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(f) (certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result). \r\nApplying the facts of this case to the guiding principles of the \"most significant relationship\" test,\r\nwe conclude that the decision to apply Texas law to Rowe's claims is appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's remaining challenge to the application of Texas law relies on <em>Phillips\r\nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts</em>, 472 U.S. 797 (1985).  National claims that Texas does not meet the\r\nconstitutional requirements as enunciated in <em>Shutts</em>.  \"[Texas] must have a 'significant contact or\r\nsignificant aggregation of contacts' to the claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class,\r\ncontacts 'creating state interests,' in order to ensure that the choice of [Texas] law is not arbitrary\r\nor unfair.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 821-22 (citing <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague</em>, 449 U.S. 302, 312-13 (1981)).  The facts\r\nof this case, as outlined above, demonstrate that Texas meets this constitutional requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFurthermore, National's reliance on <em>Shutts</em> ignores the factual differences between\r\nthe claims of the class in <em>Shutts</em> and in this case.  <em>Shutts</em> was a class action in which Kansas courts\r\napplied Kansas law to the claims of all class members.  The suit involved unpaid royalties on gas\r\nleases.  Only approximately one-quarter of one percent of the gas leases involved in the suit were\r\nlocated in Kansas.  The defendant was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business\r\nin Oklahoma.  Three named representatives filed suit in Kansas on behalf of approximately 33,000\r\nclass members located in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and certain foreign jurisdictions. \r\nTwo of the class representatives resided in Oklahoma; only the third resided in Kansas.  After notice\r\nwas mailed out and the responses were received, the Kansas court certified a class of 28,100; fewer\r\nthan 1,000 of those class members lived in Kansas.  The contacts with Kansas were not significant\r\nand thus the Supreme Court declared that Kansas failed to meet the proper constitutional limitations\r\non a forum's ability to apply its law to the claims of every class member of a nationwide class.  In\r\nour case, Texas's contacts with both the defendant and each member of the plaintiff class rise to the\r\nlevel required by the Constitution for this type of class action.  We overrule National's third and\r\nfourth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Additional Issues</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its seventh issue, National contends that the trial court erred in admitting expert\r\ntestimony without undergoing a <em>Robinson</em> analysis.  <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. v.\r\nRobinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1996).  It is widely accepted in our class action jurisprudence that\r\na trial court need not base its class certification ruling on admissible evidence.  <em>E.g.</em>,<em> Monsanto Co.\r\nv. Davis</em>, 25 S.W.3d 773, 784 (Tex. App.--Waco 2000, pet. dism'd w.o.j.); <em>Texas Commerce Bank\r\nv. Wood</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 801; <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc.</em>,\r\n929 S.W.2d 25, 30 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1996, no writ).  Courts need not apply the same level of\r\nevidentiary standards at a class certification hearing as would be applied at trial.  <em>Microsoft Corp.\r\nv. Manning</em>, 914 S.W.2d at 615.  At a certification hearing, the trial court must only have enough\r\nmaterial before it to determine the nature of the claims at issue. <em> Id</em>.  If the trial court properly bases\r\nits decision on that material, it does not abuse its discretion, even if the material offered at the\r\nhearing ultimately fails at trial. <em> Id.</em>; <em>Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Snell</em>, 847 S.W.2d 367, 376 (Tex.\r\nApp.--El Paso 1993, no writ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe concerns voiced by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Robinson</em> dealt largely with the\r\npossibility that juries might give undue weight and credibility to unreliable testimony simply because\r\nthe witness was designated as an expert.  <em>See Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d at 553.  Those same concerns\r\nare not present in a class certification hearing before a trial court.  In <em>Microsoft v. Manning</em>, the\r\ndefendant voiced an identical challenge to the production of expert testimony at the certification\r\nhearing.  914 S.W.2d at 615.  The <em>Microsoft</em> trial court accepted the material offered by the expert\r\nand, along with a great deal of other material, certified the class without any indicia of how much\r\nweight was given to the expert's opinions.  The court of appeals considered the <em>Robinson</em> challenge\r\nand determined that, in accordance with the principles allowing the consideration of non-admissible\r\nevidence at a certification hearing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the\r\npresentation of the expert's testimony.  National's challenge in this case is nearly identical to that\r\nraised in <em>Microsoft</em>.  The only discernable difference is that Rowe's experts submitted affidavits\r\nrather than live testimony.  We agree with the holding in <em>Microsoft</em> and overrule National's seventh\r\nissue regarding the admission of expert testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its final issue, National argues that the trial court erred in ordering National to bear\r\nsome of the costs of identifying the names and addresses of some class members for notification\r\npurposes.  The trial court ordered National to allow Rowe access to National's computer systems and\r\nrecords, to cooperate with Rowe's counsel, and to compile an electronic database containing a\r\nmailing list of the policyholders within the class.  On appeal, National objects to this order and cites\r\n<em>American Express Travel Related Services Co. v. Walton</em> for the proposition that the proponent of\r\nclass certification must provide notice to all class members and bear the cost of such notice.  883\r\nS.W.2d 703, 709-10 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1994, no writ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWhile National cites the general rule, the United States Supreme Court has long\r\nrecognized an exception to that rule.  In instances such as these, where the defendant is able to\r\nperform a necessary task, such as compiling a list from its internal records to be used by class\r\ncounsel in mailing the notice, with less difficulty and expense than class counsel, the trial court may\r\nproperly exercise its discretion and order the defendant to perform the task in question. \r\n<em>Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. v. Sanders</em>, 437 U.S. 340, 356 (1978).  Furthermore, the trial court enjoys\r\nthe discretion to decide whether the cost of performing this task should remain with the defendant\r\nor be borne by the class. <em> Id</em>. at 358.  The trial court has a great deal of discretion in determining who\r\nshould bear the costs of performance.  <em>Id</em>. at 359 (if substantial, may be proper for plaintiff class to\r\nreimburse defendant; if insubstantial, defendant can be ordered to pay; if task would be done in\r\nordinary course of business, regardless of substantiality, defendant may properly bear cost).  In light\r\nof the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, we believe the trial court acted within its\r\ndiscretion.

The order certifying the class lists a total of thirteen different rider forms that were issued\r\nsince 1965.  Those form numbers are 01-3014, 01-3014A, 01-3014R, 01-3014 (Rev. 5/89), 01-3014RM (Rev. 5/89), 01-3014R-MO, 01-3024, 01-3024A, 01-3024R, 01-3024R-MO, 01-3029R-MO, 01-3029, and 01-3029A.\r\n</p><p>2.   National did offer to refund the premiums that Ella Mae Rowe has paid since her rider's\r\ncoverage has terminated, but she refused.\r\n</p><p>3. \tThe trial court included the following language in its findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw on commonality:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Insurance on a child stops on the rider anniversary when the child is twenty[-five] (25) years [old] unless it stops earlier in accordance with this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Premiums are not due for this rider after it has stopped.

We will refund any premiums so\r\naccepted.\r\n</p><p>4.   The language on which National relies from <em>Kelley</em> is mere dicta.  The court states,\r\n\"Plaintiff has merely restated the three causes of action as the common issues.  If Courts were to\r\naddress the commonality issue at this level of generality, the requirement would be met every time.\r\nInstead, a Court must look at more particular factual and legal issues.\"  <em>Kelley v.

App.--Dallas\r\n1994, no writ).  In this case, National contends that compiling the database will take approximately\r\n45 hours.  Assuming a reasonable hourly billing for performing this task, any expense borne by\r\nNational will be relatively insubstantial.  Furthermore, if the expense proves more substantial than\r\nall parties originally estimated, National may petition the trial court to require reimbursement from\r\nRowe.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

(\"National\") brings this interlocutory appeal\r\nchallenging the trial court's order certifying a class action.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.\r\nยง 51.014(a)(3) (West Supp. 2002).  National contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\ncertifying the class because the appellee, Ella Mae Rowe, failed to satisfy certain requirements for\r\nclass certification under rule 42 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  We will affirm the trial\r\ncourt's order certifying the class.<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><center>BACKGROUND</center></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis case concerns child riders to life insurance policies sold by National.  National\r\nbegan selling child riders in 1965.  Rowe purchased her life insurance policy with a child rider from\r\nNational in 1977.  Since National began selling these riders, the forms of the child riders have been\r\naltered.<sup> (1)</sup>  However, all forms of the rider that lie at the center of this controversy contain substantially\r\nsimilar language.  Each rider provides for a $1,000 benefit to be paid upon the death of a child prior\r\nto termination of coverage for that child at age twenty-five.  The rider defines \"child\" as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\"Child\" as used in this rider means (1) each of the Insured's children who is named\r\nin the application for this rider, who is at least 15 days old, and who at the date of\r\napplication is not yet 18 years old, and (2) each child born to or legally adopted by\r\nthe Insured and Insured's spouse after the date of application for this rider, who\r\nbecomes 15 days old and who at the date of adoption is not yet 18 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>National does not maintain records of the insured's children and does not require notice upon the\r\nbirth or adoption of additional children after the child rider is purchased.  National simply promises\r\nto provide the $1,000 benefit upon receipt of \"due proof of death of a child.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe rider also contains the following language concerning termination of coverage:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Insurance on a Child stops on the rider anniversary when the Child is 25 years old\r\nunless it stops earlier in accordance with this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Premiums are not due for this rider after it has stopped.  If we accept a premium after\r\ntermination it does not mean that we are liable for benefits under this rider or that we\r\nwaive the termination.  We will refund any premiums so accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>National drafted these riders so that coverage terminates once the policyholder's children have\r\nreached twenty-five years of age.  However, because National recognized that it may continue to\r\nreceive rider premiums after coverage terminates, the rider disclaims liability for benefits if\r\npremiums are received and accepted after coverage terminates.  Although the rider promises a refund\r\nof premiums so accepted, National has not offered to refund the premiums collected from unnamed\r\nclass members that were remitted after coverage terminated.<sup> (2)</sup>  It is National's failure to refund\r\npremiums paid after a child turns twenty-five that forms the basis for this class action litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe termination language in the rider lies at the heart of this dispute.  Rowe alleges\r\nthat National has wrongfully continued to collect premiums for riders under which the coverage has\r\nterminated.  Policyholders do not receive a copy of the rider until after the first premium payment\r\nis received by National.  Therefore, policyholders have already initiated payment for the rider before\r\nhaving the opportunity to review the contractual language to which they have agreed.  Furthermore,\r\nRowe claims that National designed that language to place an affirmative duty on the policyholder\r\nto recognize when the rider has expired.  Rowe claims that National designed the riders in this\r\nmanner with an understanding that individuals would not recognize the nuances of this language, and\r\nthus, would likely continue to pay premiums for riders that had terminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAdditionally, Rowe argues that National is in the best position to monitor its\r\npolicyholders' rider coverage and should assume the obligation of notifying policyholders if they\r\nremit premiums that are no longer due.  Rowe further contends that National's billing policies\r\nconfuse policyholders and manipulate them into paying for terminated riders, in that National\r\nsubmits premium invoices to policyholders that fail to segregate the two premiums, one for the\r\nunderlying policy and one for the rider.  National concedes that on policies that are in effect for ten\r\nor twenty years, policyholders may forget that their premiums include payments for the rider.  Rowe\r\nargues that National should notify its policyholders about the status and charges concerning the\r\nriders.  Therefore, Rowe filed suit in March 2000 asserting claims against National for breach of\r\ncontract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Deceptive\r\nTrade Practices-Consumer Protection Act and article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nBus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. ยง 17.41 (West 2002); Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21 (West Supp. 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational responds that it should not be responsible for notifying policyholders when\r\ncoverage terminates on the rider because National has no way of knowing the ages of children\r\ncovered by the rider.  National does not maintain records of the names and ages of its policyholders'\r\nchildren.  Nor does National require notice if additional children come under the rider's umbrella\r\nof coverage.  Because National does not maintain such records, National claims that it cannot be\r\nexpected to know the number or ages of covered children.  National's second defense to Rowe's\r\nallegations is that the riders are designed to provide continuing coverage regardless of whether\r\npolicyholders have children under twenty-five when premiums are paid.  National argues that some\r\npolicyholders choose to continue paying for the rider to ensure that any after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren are covered.  National asserts, <em>inter alia</em>, that the class certification is improper because the\r\ntrial court ignored National's argument based on this continuing benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational raises eight issues in its appeal.  In its first issue, National attacks the trial\r\nplan on grounds that it relies on a flawed claim form procedure and it eliminates or lowers Rowe's\r\nburden of proof concerning reliance and National's statute of limitations defense.  In its fifth and\r\nsixth issues, National also challenges the trial plan as arbitrarily placing Rowe's breach of contract\r\nclaims ahead of the remaining tort claims and failing to consider a section of the insurance code.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Ins. Code Ann. ยง 36.159(c) (West 2002) (governing Texas Department of Insurance subpoena\r\npowers and duty to protect confidentiality of privileged records).  National's second issue challenges\r\nthe trial court's finding that the class met the commonality requirement of rule 42(a)(2).  Issues three\r\nand four challenge the trial court's determination that Texas law governs all the claims of the class. \r\nBy its seventh issue, National asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting expert\r\ntestimony in the certification hearing without properly examining it for relevance and reliability. \r\nFinally, National's eighth issue challenges the trial court's order requiring National to bear a portion\r\nof the discovery costs in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn a class action, the trial court is charged with the duty of actively policing the\r\nproceedings and guarding the class interests.  <em>See General Motors Corp. v.

Therefore, the trial court is afforded broad discretion in defining the class and\r\ndetermining whether to grant or deny a class certification.  <em>See Intratex Gas Co. v.

Even if a trial court\r\ndetermines an issue differently than would an appellate court, the ruling does not necessarily\r\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.  <em>Downer v.

In determining whether a matter should be\r\nlitigated as a class action, a trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is arbitrary, unreasonable,\r\nor without reference to any guiding principles.<em>  Tana Oil</em>, 978 S.W.2d at 740.  Further, a trial court\r\nabuses its discretion if it does not properly apply the law to the undisputed facts, but does not abuse\r\nits discretion if it bases its decision on conflicting evidence.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Vinson</em>, 880 S.W.2d at 823.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn making its class certification decision, the trial court can consider the pleadings\r\nand other material in the record, along with the evidence presented at the hearing.  <em>Employers Cas.\r\nCo. v.

After such a review, we will reverse a district court's decision\r\nto certify a class only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion in light of the evidence\r\npresented in the certification hearing, or that it applied incorrect legal standards in reaching its\r\ndecision.<em>  See Mullen v.

Noting that courts, prior to\r\nits decision in <em>Bernal</em>, were certifying class actions without conducting the proper analysis into each\r\nrequirement of rule 42, notably section (b)(4) of the rule, the Texas Supreme Court expressly rejected\r\nan \"approach of certify now and worry later.\"  <em>Id.</em>  While some have incorrectly interpreted the\r\nsupreme court's language as establishing a <em>de novo</em> standard of review for class certification, we are\r\nmindful of the remainder of the court's discussion.  <em>Bernal</em> clearly instructs that the trial court\r\ncontinues to enjoy discretion in making a class certification decision.  However, the trial court must\r\nadhere to the rule's requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Although it may not be an abuse of discretion to certify a class that could later fail,\r\nwe conclude that a cautious approach to class certification is essential.  The\r\n\"flexibility\" of Rule 42 \"enhances the usefulness of the class-action device, [but]\r\nactual, not presumed, conformance with [the Rule] remains . . . indispensable.\" \r\n<em>Falcon</em>, 457 U.S. at 160.  As the Supreme Court stressed in <em>Amchem</em>: \"Courts must\r\nbe mindful that the rule as now composed sets the requirements they are bound to\r\nenforce. . . .

Our commitment to <em>stare decisis</em> concerning the standard of review in\r\nclass action certification cases must recognize the concerns created by the class action landscape\r\nbefore <em>Bernal</em> while maintaining a grasp on the rationale behind that standard and the reasons for the\r\n\"flexibility of rule 42.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(c)(1) (trial court may alter, amend, or withdraw class\r\ncertification order at any time before final judgment).  Rule 42(c)(1) provides the trial court with the\r\ntools needed to respond to changes in the case's development.  <em>Intratex</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 407 (appellate\r\ncourt must remand when it identifies definitional problem in class certification order because\r\nprescribing proper definition is committed to trial court's discretion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOur review of the record in this case supports our conclusion that the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in certifying the class.  The trial court conducted a thorough certification\r\nhearing in which it went beyond the parties' pleadings in order to examine the claims, defenses,\r\nrelevant facts, and applicable substantive law of this case in order to make a meaningful\r\ndetermination of the certification issues.  The record before us indicates that the trial court conducted\r\na rigorous analysis of all issues presented and arrived at a cautious decision in certifying the class. \r\nThe clerk's record, combined with the first, second, and third supplemental clerk's records, consists\r\nof approximately 2,800 pages of pleadings and documentary evidence.  Additionally, the record\r\ncontains a multiple volume reporter's record.  At the certification hearing, Rowe presented one\r\nwitness, deposition excerpts from five witnesses, four affidavits from both expert and non-expert\r\nwitnesses, as well as discovery responses and other documentary evidence.  National followed by\r\npresenting three live witnesses, four affidavits, its expert witness's report, portions of a deposition,\r\nand additional documentary evidence.  At the conclusion of the certification process, the trial court\r\ndecided to certify the class.  The extensive and detailed certification order, findings of fact, and\r\nconclusions of law demonstrate that the trial court conducted a rigorous review of the information\r\npresented and determined that this case met the <em>Bernal </em>test of actual, rather than merely presumed,\r\ncompliance with the requirements of rule 42.  We are convinced that the trial court made an\r\ninformed, cautious, and proper decision that common issues predominated over individual issues,\r\nand that all issues in this case could be considered in a manageable, time-efficient, and fair manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFinally, we must not lose sight of the fact that class action certification is a trial court\r\ndecision made at the very inception of the litigation process.  One of the reasons we accord the abuse\r\nof discretion standard to the trial court is that such issues as trial plan, the management of the\r\ndiscovery process, and a litany of other factors of necessity will have only been determined as a\r\npreliminary matter when class certification is addressed by the trial court.  During the course and\r\ndevelopment of a class action, trial courts may need to alter, amend, or modify the original class\r\ncertification order. <em> See, e.g.</em>,<em> De Los Santos v.

The class action serves as a mechanism to\r\neliminate or reduce the threat of repetitive litigation, prevent inconsistent resolution of similar cases,\r\nand provide a means of redress for individual claims that are too small to make independent actions\r\neconomically viable.  <em>See Ford Motor Co. v.

The\r\nprincipal purpose of the class action device is efficiency and economy of litigation.  <em>See id.</em>\r\n(discussing origins and general design of class action device).  Thus, when properly used, a class\r\naction saves the court's and the parties' resources by allowing class-wide issues to be tried in an\r\neconomical fashion.  <em>See id.</em> at 452 (citing <em>General Tel.

Here, the trial court found\r\nthat Rowe established that this class action satisfies rule 42(b)(4), which requires questions of law\r\nor fact common to the class to predominate over questions affecting only individual members and\r\nthat class treatment be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\r\nthe controversy.

National's most significant challenge\r\nattacks the trial court's proposed trial plan.  The trial plan specifies that the class in this case will be\r\nan opt-out class.  Also, in order to determine which class members had after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren, the trial court intends to attach a Proof of Additional Children form to the notice sent to all\r\nclass members.  This form will be filled out and returned by the class members.  Class members who\r\nhave additional children who are still under twenty-five years of age may, by this process, exclude\r\nthemselves from the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFurthermore, the notice will provide an opportunity to verify whether there is a way\r\nto know the ages of children listed on a policyholder's application and which child rider form\r\nnumber applies to each class member without requiring a manual review of National's files.  But if\r\na manual review is required, then National must pay the expenses of conducting the review and\r\npreparing the results.  The court found this allocation of expenses fair in light of the fact that Rowe's\r\ncounsel is mailing out the notice and Proof of Additional Children forms at its expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan also addresses various discovery needs.  The notice and Proof of\r\nAdditional Children forms will ask class members whether they have had after-born or after-adopted\r\nchildren since the rider was purchased.  Because National has indicated that it may want to depose\r\nor otherwise obtain discovery from every class member, the trial plan states that an adequate time\r\nfor such discovery will be allowed, but that the trial court may streamline the discovery to ensure that\r\nit is not overly burdensome.  The trial court also explains that it will entertain a no-evidence motion\r\nfor summary judgment as to all class members where no evidence has been obtained of after-born\r\nor after-adopted children.  If Rowe carries the burden of proof on this issue, the trial plan calls for\r\nproof of claim forms to be issued during the damages phase of the trial.  Those class members with\r\nchildren under twenty-five years of age would then be allowed to exclude themselves from the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan also calls for a single jury to try this case in two phases.  The first phase\r\nwill determine liability and damages.  The court anticipates that most of the damages calculation will\r\nbe presented through expert testimony and that the jury could, after hearing such evidence, decide\r\nany disputes about whether a class member did in fact have after-born or after-adopted children. \r\nHowever, the trial plan anticipates that this issue may be decided either by stipulation or by partial\r\nsummary judgment.  The second phase would address punitive damages if the jury verdict from the\r\nfirst phase justifies such a submission.  After the trial, the court will hold a hearing on the entry of\r\njudgment which would allocate any undivided damages awards to the class members.  Finally, the\r\ntrial plan addresses National's statute of limitations defense and finds that a trial of that issue would\r\nbe manageable and that the submission of a fraudulent concealment and a discovery rule question\r\nto the jury would allow relief to be awarded only to those class members who fall within the statute\r\nof limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational claims that the trial plan's attempt to expedite the resolution of individual\r\nissues alters the parties' burdens, deprives National of the ability to attack Rowe's case, and unduly\r\nrestricts it from presenting viable defenses.  <em>See Bernal</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 435.  National's most vocal\r\nobjection to the plan focuses on the Proof of Additional Children form procedure.  National believes\r\nthat the trial court, through the use of the Proof of Additional Children form, has created a\r\npresumption favoring the class.  This alleged presumption, National contends, shifts the burden of\r\nproving the absence of after-born or after-adopted away from the individual class members and\r\ntowards National.  National contends that the trial plan allows for a class member to prove damages\r\nmerely by remaining silent about whether additional children exist.  National carries its argument\r\nto a conclusion that this presumption will adversely affect National in a final damages calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHowever, National's argument ignores both the preliminary nature of this trial plan\r\nas well as the uncertainty surrounding the development of the litigation.  The trial plan does not say\r\nthat the Proof of Additional Children forms or the evidence obtained from them will be admissible\r\nat trial.  The only clear inference that can be drawn from the trial plan is that the Proof of Additional\r\nChildren forms serve as the initial discovery tool employed by the trial court.  In fact, the trial court\r\nanticipated that the forms might not be returned or that further information might be needed in order\r\nfor National to present a defense.  Therefore, the court specifically referenced the possible need for\r\nadditional discovery, albeit in a streamlined manner due to the numerosity of the class, in order to\r\nobtain information favorable to National's defense.  Thus, the trial plan anticipates the need to\r\nprovide National the opportunity to develop its defense based on the fact that certain individuals may\r\nhave continued paying premiums in reliance on National's promise to preserve coverage for\r\nadditional children.  Accordingly, we conclude that the trial plan does not preclude National from\r\ndeveloping its defense.  The discovery methods outlined in the trial plan protect each party's\r\nopportunity to adequately and vigorously present any material claims and defenses.  <em>Bernal</em>, 22\r\nS.W.3d at 437.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational next attacks the trial plan on the issue of reliance.  Focusing on Rowe's\r\nallegations concerning the DTPA, the insurance code, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation,\r\nNational argues that the trial court has eliminated Rowe's burden of proving reliance.  However, we\r\nnote initially that the trial court began its focus with the breach of contract claims that apply\r\nuniformly to all class members.  Reliance is not required to prove a breach of contract.  <em>See Wright\r\nv. Christian &amp; Smith</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1668149\"><a href=\"/opinion/1668149/wright-v-christian-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 412 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no pet.) (\"The\r\nelements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) performance or\r\ntendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages\r\nto the plaintiff resulting from that breach.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAs to the non-contract claims alleged in Rowe's petition, the trial court has not\r\neliminated reliance from consideration in this case.  The trial court's order states that the presumed\r\ndirection of the trial on these non-contract claims will focus on the uniform conduct of National, its\r\nbilling policies, and its failure to refund <em>any</em> premiums paid for terminated riders.  The trial court also\r\ndetermined that some claims do not require a showing of reliance.  If various class members have\r\nactually had or planned to have additional children after their youngest child attained twenty-five\r\nyears of age, reliance becomes a substantive issue only for those discrete claims.  The discovery tools\r\nemployed in this case will determine whether reliance is a substantial issue, but until the end of the\r\ndiscovery period, the trial court's discretion should not be disturbed merely on the <em>speculation</em> that\r\na specific issue might arise that could be detrimental to a <em>portion</em> of the class.  We recognize that the\r\ntrial court may decertify or reshape the class to address issues such as reliance.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n42(c)(1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's next challenge to the trial plan concerns its statute of limitations defense. \r\nThe applicable statute of limitations in this case is two years for the tort causes of action and four\r\nyears for the breach of contract claims.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยงยง 16.003, .051 (West\r\n1997 &amp; Supp. 2002).  To survive the limitations defense, Rowe has pleaded both the discovery rule\r\nand fraudulent concealment.  The discovery rule operates to defer accrual of a cause of action until\r\nthe plaintiff knows or, by exercising reasonable diligence, should know of the facts giving rise to the\r\nclaim.  <em>Wagner &amp; Brown, Ltd. v. Horwood</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773250/wagner-brown-ltd-v-horwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span>, 734 (Tex. 2001).  A plaintiff may rely\r\non the discovery rule only when the nature of the injury is both inherently undiscoverable and\r\nobjectively verifiable.  <em>Id</em>.  Fraudulent concealment estops the defendant from relying on the statute\r\nof limitations as an affirmative defense.  <em>Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2417385\"><a href=\"/opinion/2417385/computer-associates-intern-v-altai/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>,\r\n456 (Tex. 1996).  Whether a plaintiff knew or should have known of an injury is generally a question\r\nof fact for the jury.  <em>Houston Endowment Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441519\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441519/houston-endowment-inc-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 160 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no writ).  National correctly asserts that the discovery rule and\r\nfraudulent concealment may require proof of each individual class member's subjective knowledge\r\nconcerning discovery of the injury alleged.  However, National misinterprets the trial court's plan\r\nfor determining this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial plan proposes to submit a question to the jury on fraudulent concealment and\r\nthe discovery rule so that the jury may determine when a reasonable policyholder had met the test\r\nfor either means of overcoming National's limitations defense.  National reads this proposal as\r\nlowering Rowe's burden from showing each class member's subjective knowledge to simply\r\nshowing when a reasonable person should have known.  National's interpretation incorrectly\r\nassumes that the jury will decide whether class members may overcome the limitations defense.  The\r\ntrial plan merely proposes to have the jury try these discrete issues and determine a date or time when\r\nthe injuries became discoverable.  The trial plan clearly states that this proposed course can\r\neffectively manage this issue because Rowe proposes to try this issue based on theories of breach\r\nof contract and National's uniform conduct in designing the riders, failing to refund payments, and\r\ncontinuing to bill for expired riders.  Therefore, we conclude that at this preliminary stage, the trial\r\ncourt has not lowered Rowe's burden.  The trial plan anticipates that the discovery process will\r\nproduce information from each class member regarding when that person first had sufficient\r\nknowledge of the injuries alleged in this lawsuit.  The trial court may then apply the discovery results\r\nto the jury's finding and determine which class members' claims fail as a result of limitations.  Thus,\r\nthe trial plan proposes a way to manage the trial of this issue and does not lower Rowe's burden in\r\novercoming National's affirmative defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's final two challenges to the trial plan also fail to persuade us that the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion.  Without providing any authority, National claims that the trial court\r\nerred in determining that the breach of contract claim was the primary claim asserted by Rowe.  The\r\ntrial court has discretion in managing this litigation.  Tex R. Civ. P. 42(c)(1).  The trial court's\r\ncharacterization of its preliminary determinations concerning the management of this case cannot\r\nbe said to have amounted to an abuse of discretion.  National's final attack on the trial plan relies on\r\nTexas Insurance Code section 36.159(c).  This section of the code deals with the general subpoena\r\npowers of the Texas Department of Insurance and does not have any effect on the parties to this\r\nlitigation.  Having dismissed these final two issues, and having determined that the trial court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in devising the trial plan for this case, we overrule National's first, second,\r\nfifth, and sixth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Commonality</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough National phrases its second issue as challenging the trial court's\r\ndetermination that common issues predominated over individual issues, it fails to brief an argument\r\nrelating to the rule's predominance requirement.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 42(b)(4).  Therefore, National\r\nappears to have waived any challenge to the predominance requirement.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P.\r\n38.1(h).  However, because National properly raises a challenge to the trial court's finding of\r\ncommonality, we will address both commonality and predominance as a single issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tRule 42(a)(2) does not require that all or even a substantial portion of the legal and\r\nfactual questions be common to the class.  <em>Nissan Motor Co. v. Fry</em>, 27 S.W.3d at 588.  It requires\r\nonly that <em>some</em> legal or factual questions be common to the class.  <em>Rainbow Group, Ltd. v. Johnson</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390108\"><a href=\"/opinion/2390108/rainbow-group-ltd-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 358 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).  The commonality requirement\r\nmeans that an issue of law or fact exists that inheres in the complaints of all the class members. \r\n<em>Entex v. City of Pearland</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389835\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389835/entex-v-city-of-pearland/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, 919 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.). \r\nQuestions common to the class are those which, when answered as to one class member, are\r\nanswered as to all class members.  <em>Nissan Motor Co.</em>, 27 S.W.3d at 588.  The common issues may\r\nbe those of law or fact; there need not be common issues of both law and fact, and a <em>single</em> common\r\nquestion may provide sufficient grounds for class certification.  <em>Id</em>.  The commonality requirement\r\nis generally considered satisfied where (1) many members of the class are subject to the same\r\nmisrepresentation or omissions by reason of common documents, or (2) the defendant is alleged to\r\nhave engaged in a common course of conduct.  <em>Rio Grande Valley Gas Co. v. City of Pharr</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774308\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774308/rio-grande-valley-gas-co-v-city-of-pharr/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 643 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1997, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court found that Rowe had established commonality because each child rider\r\ncontains substantially similar language in the termination clauses and the claims of the class focus\r\nlargely on this language.<sup> (3)</sup>  Rowe further established commonality by demonstrating that the class will\r\ntry the case based on the uniform breach, or anticipatory breach, of contract based on National's\r\ndesign and implementation of the riders.  Additionally, the trial court found that National's uniform\r\nconduct in billing and collecting premiums on these riders created common issues with regard to\r\nRowe's tort claims.  Finally, the trial court summarized its commonality determination into four\r\nquestions focusing on (1) whether the riders are ambiguous, (2) whether National's uniform conduct\r\namounted to a breach of the rider contracts, (3) whether National engaged in tortious conduct by its\r\nuniform billing policy and failure to refund premiums paid after termination, and (4) whether the\r\nclass is entitled to a constructive trust because of National's conduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational challenges the trial court's findings as being \"too general to satisfy the\r\ncommonality requirement because each simply restates the causes of action.\"  In support of this\r\nproposition, National cites <em>Kelley v. Galveston Autoplex</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span>, 475 (S.D. Tex. 2000).<sup> (4)</sup> \r\nHowever, in <em>Kelley</em>, the federal district court did not find commonality because the alleged violations\r\ntook many different forms.  The court indicated that in order for certification to be proper, the\r\ncontracts in issue would have had to be \"a single type of contract that is virtually, if not completely,\r\nidentical in each transaction.\"  <em>Id</em>. (quoting <em>Durrett v. John Deere Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span>, 557 (N.D.\r\nTex. 1993)).  Here, each class member entered into an agreement for insurance coverage using\r\nvirtually identical contracts issued by National.  Furthermore, National's alleged tortious conduct\r\nwas uniform for every class member.  Therefore, because National engaged in a common course of\r\nconduct and entered into agreements with each class member based on virtually identical documents,\r\nwe cannot say that the trial court's initial determination that the commonality requirement had been\r\nsatisfied was an abuse of discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Choice of Law</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court made an initial determination to apply Texas law in this class action\r\nlitigation.  Which state's law governs an issue is a question of law for the court to decide. \r\n<em>Torrington Co. v.

But determining the state contacts to be considered by\r\nthe court in making this legal determination involves a factual inquiry.  <em>Hughes</em>, 18 S.W.3d at 204. \r\nTexas courts apply the Restatement's \"most significant relationship\" test to decide choice-of-law\r\nissues.  <em>Torrington</em>, 46 S.W.3d at 848; Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยงยง 6, 145, 188, 192\r\n(1971).  Section 6 of the Restatement lists the following general factors used to decide a choice-of-law question:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the needs of the interstate and international systems,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the relevant policies of the forum,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those\r\nstates in the determination of the particular issue,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the protection of justified expectations,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li>ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 6(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn addition to applying the principles enumerated in section 6, we must also refer to\r\nsections 145 and 188 because Rowe's causes of action encompass both tort and contract claims. \r\nSection 145 contains the following factual matters to be considered when applying these principles\r\nto a tort case: (a) the place where the injury occurred; (b) the place where the conduct causing the\r\ninjury occurred; (c) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business\r\nof the parties; and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nยง 145(2).  Under section 188 of the Restatement, we determine contractual rights and duties by the\r\nlaw of the state with the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.  <em>Minnesota\r\nMining &amp; Mfg.

When, as here, the parties have not expressly chosen the applicable law,\r\nwe consider the following contacts in determining which law governs their controversy: (a) the place\r\nof contracting; (b) the place of negotiation; (c) the place of performance; (d) the location of the\r\ncontract's subject matter; and (e) the parties' domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation,\r\nand place of business.  Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 188(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough National is domiciled in Colorado, it does not maintain any offices or\r\nemployees in Colorado, and its principal place of business and administrative offices are located in\r\nAustin, Texas.  National maintains all contact with policyholders from its Austin offices, it transmits\r\ncorrespondence containing the billing notices from Austin, and it receives all premium payments in\r\nAustin.  Furthermore, all of the child riders at issue in this case were designed in Texas, and all\r\nconduct allegedly causing injury to the class members in both contract and tort occurred as a result\r\nof National's activities in Texas.  While only twenty-seven percent of the riders purchased by class\r\nmembers were sold in Texas, every class member maintained direct contact with Texas in originally\r\npurchasing the rider and paying premiums.  Additionally, National's obligations of performance for\r\nany claims made under the rider occurred in Texas.  Applying these considerations to the list of\r\nfactors in sections 188 and 145 of the Restatement, the choice to use Texas law appears proper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational attempts to overcome this strong indication that Texas law should apply by \r\narguing that section 192 of the Restatement requires that the law of the individual insured's state\r\nshould apply.  Section 192 states:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The validity of a life insurance contract issued to the insured upon his application and\r\nthe rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an effective choice of law\r\nby the insured in his application, by the local law of the state where the insured was\r\ndomiciled at the time the policy was applied for, unless, with respect to the particular\r\nissue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated\r\nin ยง 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state\r\nwill be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 192.  National focuses solely on the first part of this\r\nsection.  The general rule espoused by section 192 is not applicable in this case.  Rather, we must\r\nlook to the exception found in this section for guidance because of the facts and surrounding\r\nprocedural concerns of this case.  Because we believe that Texas \"has a more significant relationship\r\nunder the principles stated in section 6\" to this case, section 192's rule favoring application of the\r\nlaw of the insured's state does not apply. <em> Id.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe basic principles of section 6 favor the application of Texas law.  It is reasonable\r\nto assume that National expected Texas law to apply to its actions in contracting for, billing, and\r\ncollecting premiums for its riders.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(d) (protection of justified expectations).  With a\r\nlarge number of class members having purchased their riders in Texas and the action having been\r\nfiled in Texas, the ease of determination and application factor favors Texas law.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(g)\r\n(ease in determination and application of law to be applied).  In a class action such as this one, with\r\na single defendant located in one forum and a large number of class members scattered throughout\r\nforty-one states, the desire for certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result weigh heavily toward\r\napplication of Texas law.  <em>See id.</em> ยง 6(2)(f) (certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result). \r\nApplying the facts of this case to the guiding principles of the \"most significant relationship\" test,\r\nwe conclude that the decision to apply Texas law to Rowe's claims is appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNational's remaining challenge to the application of Texas law relies on <em>Phillips\r\nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111491\"><a href=\"/opinion/111491/phillips-petroleum-co-v-shutts/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span> (1985).  National claims that Texas does not meet the\r\nconstitutional requirements as enunciated in <em>Shutts</em>.  \"[Texas] must have a 'significant contact or\r\nsignificant aggregation of contacts' to the claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class,\r\ncontacts 'creating state interests,' in order to ensure that the choice of [Texas] law is not arbitrary\r\nor unfair.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 821-22 (citing <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110370\"><a href=\"/opinion/110370/allstate-ins-co-v-hague/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 312-13 (1981)).  The facts\r\nof this case, as outlined above, demonstrate that Texas meets this constitutional requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFurthermore, National's reliance on <em>Shutts</em> ignores the factual differences between\r\nthe claims of the class in <em>Shutts</em> and in this case.  <em>Shutts</em> was a class action in which Kansas courts\r\napplied Kansas law to the claims of all class members.  The suit involved unpaid royalties on gas\r\nleases.  Only approximately one-quarter of one percent of the gas leases involved in the suit were\r\nlocated in Kansas.  The defendant was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business\r\nin Oklahoma.  Three named representatives filed suit in Kansas on behalf of approximately 33,000\r\nclass members located in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and certain foreign jurisdictions. \r\nTwo of the class representatives resided in Oklahoma; only the third resided in Kansas.  After notice\r\nwas mailed out and the responses were received, the Kansas court certified a class of 28,100; fewer\r\nthan 1,000 of those class members lived in Kansas.  The contacts with Kansas were not significant\r\nand thus the Supreme Court declared that Kansas failed to meet the proper constitutional limitations\r\non a forum's ability to apply its law to the claims of every class member of a nationwide class.  In\r\nour case, Texas's contacts with both the defendant and each member of the plaintiff class rise to the\r\nlevel required by the Constitution for this type of class action.  We overrule National's third and\r\nfourth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Additional Issues</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its seventh issue, National contends that the trial court erred in admitting expert\r\ntestimony without undergoing a <em>Robinson</em> analysis.  <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. v.\r\nRobinson</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639733\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639733/ei-du-pont-de-nemours-co-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (Tex. 1996).  It is widely accepted in our class action jurisprudence that\r\na trial court need not base its class certification ruling on admissible evidence.  <em>E.g.</em>,<em> Monsanto Co.\r\nv. Davis</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167003/monsanto-co-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>, 784 (Tex. App.--Waco 2000, pet. dism'd w.o.j.); <em>Texas Commerce Bank\r\nv. Wood</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 801; <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc.</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1564519\"><a href=\"/opinion/1564519/st-louis-sw-ry-v-voluntary-purch/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 30 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1996, no writ).  Courts need not apply the same level of\r\nevidentiary standards at a class certification hearing as would be applied at trial.  <em>Microsoft Corp.\r\nv. Manning</em>, 914 S.W.2d at 615.  At a certification hearing, the trial court must only have enough\r\nmaterial before it to determine the nature of the claims at issue. <em> Id</em>.  If the trial court properly bases\r\nits decision on that material, it does not abuse its discretion, even if the material offered at the\r\nhearing ultimately fails at trial. <em> Id.</em>; <em>Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Snell</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388580\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388580/dresser-industries-inc-v-snell/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 376 (Tex.\r\nApp.--El Paso 1993, no writ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe concerns voiced by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Robinson</em> dealt largely with the\r\npossibility that juries might give undue weight and credibility to unreliable testimony simply because\r\nthe witness was designated as an expert.  <em>See Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d at 553.  Those same concerns\r\nare not present in a class certification hearing before a trial court.  In <em>Microsoft v. Manning</em>, the\r\ndefendant voiced an identical challenge to the production of expert testimony at the certification\r\nhearing.  914 S.W.2d at 615.  The <em>Microsoft</em> trial court accepted the material offered by the expert\r\nand, along with a great deal of other material, certified the class without any indicia of how much\r\nweight was given to the expert's opinions.  The court of appeals considered the <em>Robinson</em> challenge\r\nand determined that, in accordance with the principles allowing the consideration of non-admissible\r\nevidence at a certification hearing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the\r\npresentation of the expert's testimony.  National's challenge in this case is nearly identical to that\r\nraised in <em>Microsoft</em>.  The only discernable difference is that Rowe's experts submitted affidavits\r\nrather than live testimony.  We agree with the holding in <em>Microsoft</em> and overrule National's seventh\r\nissue regarding the admission of expert testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its final issue, National argues that the trial court erred in ordering National to bear\r\nsome of the costs of identifying the names and addresses of some class members for notification\r\npurposes.  The trial court ordered National to allow Rowe access to National's computer systems and\r\nrecords, to cooperate with Rowe's counsel, and to compile an electronic database containing a\r\nmailing list of the policyholders within the class.  On appeal, National objects to this order and cites\r\n<em>American Express Travel Related Services Co. v. Walton</em> for the proposition that the proponent of\r\nclass certification must provide notice to all class members and bear the cost of such notice.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1524981\"><a href=\"/opinion/1524981/american-exp-travel-related-services-co-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 709-10 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1994, no writ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWhile National cites the general rule, the United States Supreme Court has long\r\nrecognized an exception to that rule.  In instances such as these, where the defendant is able to\r\nperform a necessary task, such as compiling a list from its internal records to be used by class\r\ncounsel in mailing the notice, with less difficulty and expense than class counsel, the trial court may\r\nproperly exercise its discretion and order the defendant to perform the task in question. \r\n<em>Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. v. Sanders</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109903\"><a href=\"/opinion/109903/oppenheimer-fund-inc-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 356 (1978).  Furthermore, the trial court enjoys\r\nthe discretion to decide whether the cost of performing this task should remain with the defendant\r\nor be borne by the class. <em> Id</em>. at 358.  The trial court has a great deal of discretion in determining who\r\nshould bear the costs of performance.  <em>Id</em>. at 359 (if substantial, may be proper for plaintiff class to\r\nreimburse defendant; if insubstantial, defendant can be ordered to pay; if task would be done in\r\nordinary course of business, regardless of substantiality, defendant may properly bear cost).  In light\r\nof the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, we believe the trial court acted within its\r\ndiscretion.  The trial court's order allocates to National only an insubstantial expense of compiling\r\nan electronic database.<sup> (5)</sup>  We overrule National's eighth issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHaving reviewed the record and considered the arguments of both parties, we\r\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering class certification.  The trial\r\ncourt's order is affirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                                                     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\tMack Kidd, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Justices Kidd, Yeakel and Patterson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affirmed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filed:   August 8, 2002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publish</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.   The order certifying the class lists a total of thirteen different rider forms that were issued\r\nsince 1965.  Those form numbers are 01-3014, 01-3014A, 01-3014R, 01-3014 (Rev. 5/89), 01-3014RM (Rev. 5/89), 01-3014R-MO, 01-3024, 01-3024A, 01-3024R, 01-3024R-MO, 01-3029R-MO, 01-3029, and 01-3029A.\r\n</p><p>2.   National did offer to refund the premiums that Ella Mae Rowe has paid since her rider's\r\ncoverage has terminated, but she refused.\r\n</p><p>3. \tThe trial court included the following language in its findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw on commonality:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Insurance on a child stops on the rider anniversary when the child is twenty[-five] (25) years [old] unless it stops earlier in accordance with this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Premiums are not due for this rider after it has stopped.  If we accept a\r\npremium after termination, it does not mean we are liable for benefits under\r\nthis rider or that we waive the termination.  We will refund any premiums so\r\naccepted.\r\n</p><p>4.   The language on which National relies from <em>Kelley</em> is mere dicta.  The court states,\r\n\"Plaintiff has merely restated the three causes of action as the common issues.  If Courts were to\r\naddress the commonality issue at this level of generality, the requirement would be met every time.\r\nInstead, a Court must look at more particular factual and legal issues.\"  <em>Kelley v. Galveston Autoplex</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span>, 475 (S.D. Tex. 2000).\r\n</p><p>5.   The <em>American Express</em> case to which National cites involved an expense of $100,000. \r\n<em>American Express Travel Related Servs. Co. v. Walton</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1524981\"><a href=\"/opinion/1524981/american-exp-travel-related-services-co-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 709-10 (Tex. App.--Dallas\r\n1994, no writ).  In this case, National contends that compiling the database will take approximately\r\n45 hours.  Assuming a reasonable hourly billing for performing this task, any expense borne by\r\nNational will be relatively insubstantial.  Furthermore, if the expense proves more substantial than\r\nall parties originally estimated, National may petition the trial court to require reimbursement from\r\nRowe.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",
