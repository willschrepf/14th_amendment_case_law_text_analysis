McCAUGHTRY, et al.                   John C. Shabaz,\n    Defendants-Appellees.                    Judge.\n\n\n                                    ORDER\n\n       Wisconsin inmate Curtis Walker appeals from the dismissal of his civil rights\nlawsuit at the 28 U.S.C. § 1915A screening stage. During a search of Walker’s cell,\na guard found a letter from an inmate at another prison that referred to the Lords\nof Islam, a gang. After a hearing, Walker was found guilty of violating Wis. Admin.\nCode § DOC 303.20(3), which prohibits gang activity, and was punished with\nsegregation, disciplinary separation, and a transfer to another prison. He filed a\ncomplaint claiming that the punishment violated his free speech rights, that\n§ 303.20(3) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that he was deprived of\ndue process. The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that Walker failed\nto state a claim. Walker now appeals, and we affirm.\n\n\n      *\n       After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that\noral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the\nrecord. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 04–2696                                                                     Page 2\n\n\n       The regulation Walker challenges as vague and overbroad is entitled “Group\nresistance and petitions” and provides in full:\n\n      Any inmate who participates in any activity with an inmate gang, as\n      defined in s. DOC 303.02(11), or possesses any gang literature, creed,\n      symbols or symbolisms is guilty of an offense. An inmate’s\n      possession of gang literature, creed symbols or symbolism is an act\n      which shows that the inmate violates the rule. Institution staff may\n      determine on a case by case basis what constitutes an unsanctioned\n      group activity.\n\nIn turn, § 303.02(11) defines an “inmate gang” as “a group of inmates which is not\nsanctioned by the warden.” Another provision, § 309.365(5)(c)(2), provides that the\nwarden may not approve an inmate gang as an activity group.\n\n       On appeal Walker initially contends that his First Amendment claim was\nimproperly dismissed because only a compelling government need, addressed\nthrough the least restrictive possible means, could justify punishing him for\npossessing a letter. Walker is wrong: a prison regulation need only be reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate penological interest in order to survive constitutional attack.\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987); Lindell v. Frank, 377 F.3d 655, 657 (7th\nCir. 2004). And we accord prison administrators “wide-ranging deference in the\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed\nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979). In Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court\nagreed with the Second Circuit on the basic premiss that a penal “institution must\nbe permitted to use reasonable means to insure that its legitimate interests in\nsecurity are safeguarded . . . [and courts] should not second-guess the expert\nadministrators on matters on which they are better informed . . . [for] [c]oncern\nwith minutia of prison administration can only detract the court from detached\nconsideration of the question presented to it: does the practice or condition violate\nthe Constitution?” Id. at 544. It is beyond question that prisons have a legitimate\ninterest in preventing gang activity—such as inmate communications with gang\nmembers at other prisons—which poses a serious threat to institutional safety. See\nRios v. Lane, 812 F.2d 1032, 1037 (7th Cir. 1987) (upholding regulation preventing\ngang activity even under earlier intermediate standard that required a substantial\nstate interest addressed through the narrowest possible means); see also Sasnett v.\nSullivan, 91 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 1996), vacated on other grounds, 521 U.S.\n1114 (1997).\n\n     Walker next challenges the district court’s dismissal of his overbreadth and\nvagueness claims, contending that the regulation vests so much discretion in prison\n\fNo. 04–2696                                                                    Page 3\n\nofficials in defining gang activity as to be unconstitutional. Insofar as Walker seeks\nmonetary and declaratory relief, however, these claims, if successful, would imply\nthe invalidity of his sentence and may not be raised in a suit under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. See Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 645–47 (1997); Hughes v. Lott, 350\nF.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir. 2001). Proving the regulation unconstitutional would\nnecessarily impugn his disciplinary conviction and segregation sentence, which\nextends his mandatory release date and therefore affects the duration of his\nconfinement. See Cochran v. Buss, 381 F.3d 637, 639 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that\nsuspension of good time credits could lengthen confinement and therefore could not\nbe challenged in § 1983 suit). But Walker also seeks an injunction to prevent\nenforcement of § 303.20, and succeeding would not impugn his sentence. See\nEdwards, 520 U.S. at 648.\n\n      A regulation is overbroad and violates the First Amendment only if it\npunishes a “substantial” amount of protected free speech. Virginia v. Hicks, 539\nU.S. 113, 118–20 (2003); Hodgkins ex rel. Hodgkins v. Peterson, 355 F.3d 1048,\n1056 (7th Cir. 2004). But inmates have restricted First Amendment rights, so the\noverbreadth concept has limited relevance to the prison context. Ustrak v.\nFairman, 781 F.2d 573, 580 (7th Cir. 1986). This regulation threatens no protected\nspeech at all—let alone a substantial amount—because, as noted above, it\nreasonably relates to a legitimate penological interest.\n\n       A regulation is unconstitutionally vague if it is so unclear that people of\nordinary intelligence cannot determine what conduct it prohibits. United States v.\nTurcotte, 405 F.3d 515, 531 (7th Cir. 2005). A plaintiff raising a facial attack must\ndemonstrate that the regulation is impermissibly vague in all of its\napplications—including its application to his case. Village of Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 497 (1982). Here, Walker had notice\nthat the letter was prohibited: it referred to the Lords of Islam, a group of inmates\nthat the warden had not approved. Moreover, although Walker says the regulation\nvests limitless discretion in prison officials to define gang activity, we have\nobserved that outside of prison, statutes may give police officers discretion to\nidentify gangs. See Fuller ex rel. Fuller v. Decatur Public Sch. Bd., 251 F.3d 662,\n668 (7th Cir. 2001). We see no reason why prison officials, operating in a\ndangerous environment rife with gang activity, cannot have the same discretion.\n\n      Finally Walker argues in general terms that he was deprived of due process\nbecause the guards punished him “for doing something law enforce[ment] officials\nsaid he could do”—namely, possessing the gang letter. Walker implies that the\nprison officials screened the letter, observed the reference to the gang, and then\ngave the letter to Walker only to change their minds later. But Walker’s complaint\nreveals that the guards more likely missed the gang material when the letter\narrived, and confiscated it as soon as they caught the reference. Surely if a pistol\n\fNo. 04–2696                                                              Page 4\n\nsomehow made its way through security to an inmate via the mail, Walker would\nagree that prison officials could seize it upon discovery.\n\n                                                                  AFFIRMED.\n\f",
