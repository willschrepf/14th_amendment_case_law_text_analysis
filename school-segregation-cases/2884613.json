R. Civ. P. 60(b).\n\fWe conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.\n\nBecause this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s order. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n         Barner, a federal prisoner, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2241, challenging his confinement in administrative detention, the initiation\n\nof that confinement through a detention order, and the disciplinary proceedings whereby\n\nhe was sanctioned with a loss of 13 days good time credit, a 15-day term in disciplinary\n\nsegregation, and a loss of commissary and visitation privileges for six months. The\n\nDistrict Court denied his petition, and we affirmed. C.A. No. 06-3351. While the appeal\n\nof his habeas petition was pending, Barner filed a motion for relief from judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), claiming that the Appellee had committed a fraud upon\n\nthe District Court. The motion was denied, and Barner appeals.\n\n         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We will summarily affirm a\n\ndistrict court’s order if an appeal presents no substantial question. See I.O.P. 10.6. The\n\ndenial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Reform Party of\n\nAllegheny County v. Allegheny County Dep’t. of Elections, 174 F.3d 305, 311 (3d Cir.\n\n1999). An appeal from denial of relief under Rule 60(b) brings up only the subject matter\n\nof the motion and not the underlying case. Smith v. Evans, 853 F.2d 155, 158 n.1 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f         A Rule 60(b) motion may be granted if an adverse party committed fraud,\n\nmisrepresentation, or other misconduct. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3). In his Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion, Barner asserts that he is entitled to relief because the Appellee submitted a\n\nfraudulent report by the disciplinary hearing officer to the District Court and that the\n\nreport was materially different from the one that he had received in connection with his\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. The District Court concluded that Appellee had not submitted a\n\nfraudulent document, holding that Barner’s version of the report was simply a draft of the\n\nfinal version that Appellee had submitted. Furthermore, the District Court concluded\n\nthat, contrary to Barner’s assertion, the two reports were not materially different and that\n\ndenial of his habeas petition was warranted based on the content of either report. We\n\nagree.\n\n         Because the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion and because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily\n\naffirm the District Court’s order. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f",
