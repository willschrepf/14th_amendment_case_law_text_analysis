DERRICK, Appellee\n\n                   On Appeal from the 151st District Court\n                           Harris County, Texas\n                     Trial Court Cause No. 2009-12226\n\n                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n      In this case, appellee Bruce W. Derrick brought suit against appellant Moon\nSun (Casey) Kang, and appellants Kathleen (Katie) Lee and Sang Pil (Scott) Lee\n(the “Lees”) for breach of a commercial lease agreement (the “Lease”). Kang and\nthe Lees brought assorted counterclaims and alleged various affirmative defenses.\nDerrick moved for no-evidence summary judgment as to Kang’s and the Lees’\n\fcounterclaims and affirmative defenses. The trial court granted Derrick’s no-\nevidence motion for summary judgment in an interlocutory order and later denied\nreconsideration of its order. At trial, the jury found that Kang failed to comply\nwith the lease, and that the Lees were assignees who consented to be bound by and\nfailed to comply with the lease. The jury awarded damages and attorney’s fees to\nDerrick, and the trial court rendered final judgment.\n\n         In this appeal, in three related issues, Kang and the Lees challenge the trial\ncourt’s grant of a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Derrick, and the\ncourt’s denial of their motions to compel and for sanctions. In addition, Kang\nargues that the trial court erred by rendering judgment for damages and attorney’s\nfees jointly and severally against him and the Lees. We affirm.\n\n                 I.      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n         On February 24, 2000, Derrick, as landlord, and Kang, as tenant, entered\ninto the Lease for commercial space located within a shopping center in Webster,\nTexas. In October 2004, the Lees began occupying the premises leased by Kang\nand began paying rent for the space. The Lees continued to occupy the space until\nthe end of the Lease in February 2005 and then remained on a month-to-month\nbasis.    The Lease was not modified, and no new lease agreement was ever\nexecuted. The Lees failed to timely pay all rent and other charges owed to Derrick\nunder the terms of the Lease. Ultimately, Derrick formally requested that the Lees\nvacate the premises.\n\n         In February 2009, Derrick filed suit for breach of the Lease against Kang.\nDerrick added the Lees as defendants in April 2010. Kang and the Lees filed\ncounterclaims for violations of the DTPA, fraud, fraud by nondisclosure, fraud in a\nreal estate transaction, and negligent misrepresentation. They also alleged various\naffirmative defenses: duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, waiver,\n                                            2\n\fpayment, laches, release, accord and satisfaction, and ratification.\n\n      On December 29, 2010, Derrick filed a motion for no-evidence summary\njudgment as to all of Kang’s and the Lees’ counterclaims and affirmative defenses.\nKang and the Lees responded, objecting that Derrick’s motion was untimely and\nthat it did not specify which elements of Kang’s and the Lees’ counterclaims and\ndefenses were being challenged. To their responses, Kang and the Lees attached:\nan affidavit by Kang with multiple exhibits; an affidavit by Katie Lee with multiple\nexhibits; an affidavit by Thomas Clayton, counsel for the Lees, with an exhibit; an\n“Accounting entitled K’s Art & Frame, Assuming Ne [sic] Lease Signed in 2005”;\nand an “Accounting by defendants of amounts paid and charged.” Kang and the\nLees also filed a motion to compel and for sanctions, a motion for continuance of\nthe summary judgment motion, and a “supplemental [Clayton] affidavit in support\nof” their responses and motions.\n\n      The trial court denied Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for continuance. The\ncourt granted Derrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment on February\n10, 2011. Kang and the Lees moved for rehearing. The trial court held a hearing\nin May 2011 and permitted Kang and the Lees to resend certain defective\ndiscovery. In September 2011, Kang and the Lees filed a supplemental response to\nDerrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment, as well as supplemental\nmotions to compel and for sanctions. On September 28, 2011, the trial court\ndenied Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing.\n\n      On October 26, 2011, the trial court granted Kang’s and the Lees’ motions to\ncompel in part and denied their motions for sanctions. Kang and the Lees again\nmoved for discovery sanctions, and the trial court denied their motions. A jury\ntrial was held in October 2012 on Derrick’s breach of the Lease claims, and the\njury found in favor of Derrick. Specifically, the jury found that Kang failed to\n\n                                          3\n\fcomply with the Lease, the Lees were assignees of the Lease, the Lees consented\nto the terms of the Lease, and the Lees failed to comply with the Lease. The jury\nawarded actual damages against Kang, actual damages against the Lees jointly and\nseverally, and attorney’s fees against Kang and the Lees jointly and severally. The\ntrial court signed its final judgment based on the jury’s verdict. Kang and the Lees\nboth appealed.\n\n                               II.      ANALYSIS\n\n      In their first three issues, which they group together in their briefs, Kang and\nthe Lees argue that the trial court erred in granting Derrick’s no-evidence motion\nfor summary judgment on their counterclaims and affirmative defenses, and erred\nin denying Kang’s and the Lees’ motions to compel and for sanctions.              We\ndisagree.\n\nA. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.\n\n      1. Rule 166a(i) requirements and standard of review\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, the party without the burden of proof\nmay, without presenting evidence, move for summary judgment on the ground that\nthere is no evidence to support an essential element of the nonmovant’s claim or\ndefense. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). A no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n“must state the elements as to which there is no evidence.” Id. A no-evidence\nmotion should not be general or conclusory. Id. 166a cmt. to 1997 change.\n\n      A no-evidence motion for summary judgment must be granted if: (1) the\nmoving party asserts that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of\na claim or defense on which the adverse party would have the burden of proof at\ntrial, and (2) the respondent produces no summary judgment evidence raising a\ngenuine issue of material fact on those elements. See id. 166a(i). We review a no-\n\n                                          4\n\fevidence summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmovant. Smith v. O’Donnell, 288 S.W.3d 417, 424 (Tex.\n2009) (citing City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 824 (Tex. 2005)); Merrell\nDow Pharms., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997). We credit\nevidence favorable to the nonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and we disregard\nevidence contrary to the nonmovant unless reasonable jurors could not. Timpe\nIndus., Inc. v. Gish, 286 S.W.3d 306, 310 (Tex. 2009) (describing no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment as “essentially a motion for pretrial directed\nverdict”).\n\n      Although the nonmovant need not marshal its proof, it has the burden to and\nmust present evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact on each of the\nchallenged elements. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135\nS.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004). A no-evidence summary judgment motion may not\nproperly be granted if the nonmovant brings forth more than a scintilla of evidence\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact on the challenged elements. Ridgway, 135\nS.W.3d at 600. More than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence “rises to\na level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their\nconclusions.” Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 711.\n\n      2. Specificity of the no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n      First, Kang and the Lees argue that Derrick’s no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment “did not specifically allege nor challenge the specific claim or\ndefense, or element thereof, of the Appellants of which there is no evidence.” We\nfind no merit in this argument.\n\n      Derrick’s no-evidence motion tracked Kang’s and the Lees’ pleadings and\nidentified their theories of liability as follows: violations of the DTPA; fraud\n(common-law, by nondisclosure, and in a real estate transaction); and negligent\n\n                                        5\n\fmisrepresentation.\n\n      With respect to the DTPA claims, Derrick asserted there was no evidence\nthat: the Lees were consumers; Derrick committed a false, misleading, or deceptive\nact under section 17.46(b) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, or engaged\nin an unconscionable act or practice; and Derrick’s alleged actions were a\nproducing cause of Kang’s and the Lees’ alleged injuries. See Amstadt v. U.S.\nBrass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644, 649 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      With respect to the common-law fraud claims, Derrick argued there was no\nevidence that: a material representation was made, it was false, Derrick knew it\nwas false or made the representation recklessly, and he made the representation\nwith intent that Kang and the Lees act on it. See Lundy v. Mason, 260 S.W.3d 482,\n492 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n\n      With respect to the fraud by nondisclosure claims, Derrick asserted there\nwas no evidence that: Derrick concealed or failed to disclose material facts within\nhis knowledge or he knew Kang and the Lees did not have an equal opportunity to\ndiscover the truth; and Derrick intended to induce Kang and the Lees to take some\naction. See McCarthy v. Wani Venture, A.S., 251 S.W.3d 573, 585–89 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\n\n      With respect to the fraud in a real estate transaction claims, Derrick asserted\nthere was no evidence that he made any misrepresentations, false promises, or\nnondisclosures to Kang and the Lees for the purpose of inducing them into entering\na contract. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 27.01 (West 2009).\n\n      With respect to the negligent misrepresentation claims, Derrick argued there\nwas no evidence that: he supplied “false information” for the guidance of Kang and\nthe Lees in their business; and Derrick provided a misstatement of existing fact,\n\n\n                                         6\n\fwhich caused an alleged injury, independent of any breach of contract claim. See\nD.S.A., Inc. v. Hillsboro Indep. Sch. Dist., 973 S.W.2d 662, 663 (Tex. 1998) (per\ncuriam); Fed. Land Ass’n of Tyler v. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1991);\nEaton Metal Products, L.L.C. v. U.S. Denro Steels, Inc., No. 14-09-00757-CV,\n2010 WL 3795192, at *6 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 30, 2010, no\npet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      With respect to damages, Derrick also asserted there was no evidence of:\nout-of-pocket or reliance damages—that Kang and the Lees gave something, the\nfair market value of which was more than they received; “benefit of the bargain\ndamages”; and damages for loss of credit or damage to their credit reputation.\nWith respect to Kang’s and the Lees’ request for “multiple damages,” Derrick\nargued there was no evidence that: he acted with actual awareness of any alleged\nfalsity, deception, or unfairness of an act or practice. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\nAnn. § 17.45(9) (West 2011) (knowing violation). And there was no evidence\nDerrick acted with actual awareness of any alleged falsity, deception, or unfairness\nof an act or practice or of a condition of defect constituting a breach of warranty,\nand with the specific intent of having Kang and the Lees act in detrimental reliance\non any alleged falsity or deception or in detrimental ignorance of the unfairness.\nSee id. § 17.45(13) (intentional violation).\n\n      Derrick’s motion further identified Kang’s 1 and the Lees’ 2 affirmative\ndefenses as follows: duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, waiver,\npayment, laches, release, accord and satisfaction, and ratification. With respect to\nduress, Derrick argued there was no evidence that: he made a threat or acted\nwithout legal justification against the Lees to destroy their free agency; and\n\n      1\n          Kang did not plead duress, failure of consideration, or waiver.\n      2\n          The Lees did not plead accord and satisfaction, or ratification.\n\n                                                  7\n\fDerrick threatened or acted against the Lees to overcome their free will. See\nMcMahan v. Greenwood, 108 S.W.3d 467, 482 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2003, pet. denied).\n\n      With respect to estoppel, Derrick asserted there was no evidence that he\nmade a false representation or concealed material facts with actual or constructive\nknowledge of those facts, or with the intention that the representation be acted on.\nSee 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 245 S.W.3d 488,\n504 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).\n\n      With respect to failure of consideration, Derrick argued there was no\nevidence that: the parties entered into any agreement other than the Lease; and\nDerrick either completely or partially failed to complete any promised performance\nunder the Lease. See Walden v. Affiliated Comp. Servs., Inc., 97 S.W.3d 303, 320–\n21 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\n      With respect to fraud, Derrick argued there was no evidence that: he made a\nmaterial representation that was false, which he knew was false or made recklessly\nwithout any knowledge of its truth; and Derrick intended to induce Kang and the\nLees to act upon the representation. See McLernon v. Dynegy, Inc., 347 S.W.3d\n315, 328 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n      With respect to waiver, Derrick argued there was no evidence that: he\nintentionally relinquished a known right or intentionally acted inconsistently with\nclaiming any right; and Derrick said or did anything inconsistent with an intent by\nhim to rely on any of his rights. See Cont’l Casing Corp. v. Siderca Corp., 38\nS.W.3d 782, 789 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.).\n\n      With respect to payment, Derrick asserted that there was no evidence of: the\naccounts required to be filed with Kang’s and the Lees’ respective pleas of\n\n\n                                         8\n\fpayment stating distinctly the nature of such payment; and Kang’s and the Lees’\npleas did not particularly describe any payments so as to provide Derrick with full\nnotice of their character. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 95; Calzada v. Am. First Nat’l Bank,\nNo. 14-07-00022-CV, 2008 WL 324912, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\nFeb. 7, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.); Harrison v. Leasing Assocs., Inc., 454 S.W.2d\n808, 809 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1970, no writ).\n\n      With respect to laches, Derrick argued there was no evidence that: he\nunreasonably delayed in asserting his legal or equitable rights; and Kang and the\nLees made a good-faith change in position to their detriment because of any\nalleged delay. See Caldwell v. Barnes, 975 S.W.2d 535, 538 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      With respect to release, Derrick asserted that there was no evidence of any\nof the elements needed to prove a release, which are the same as the elements of a\ncontract3: an offer, an acceptance, mutual assent, execution and delivery of the\nrelease with the intent it be mutual and binding, and consideration. See Searcy v.\nDDA, Inc., 201 S.W.3d 319, 322 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.).\n\n      With respect to accord and satisfaction, Derrick argued that there was no\nevidence of any of the elements of a new contract which discharged Kang’s\nexisting obligation. See Hycarbex, Inc. v. Anglo-Suisse, Inc., 927 S.W.2d 103, 108\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n      Finally, with respect to ratification, Derrick asserted there was no evidence\nthat Derrick, through his acts, words, or conduct, approved a contract with the Lees\nwhich released Kang from any further obligation.          See Motel Enters., Inc. v.\nNobani, 784 S.W.2d 545, 547 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ).\n\n\n      3\n         See Vera v. N. Star Dodge Sales, Inc., 989 S.W.2d 13, 17 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n1998, no pet.).\n\n                                           9\n\f       The record thus reflects that, in moving for no-evidence summary judgment,\nDerrick specified one, more, or all essential elements of each of the claims and\ntheories of liability and affirmative defenses Kang and the Lees alleged in their\ncounterpetitions and answers and on which they would have the burden of proof at\ntrial. See Gary E. Patterson & Assocs., P.C. v. Holub, 264 S.W.3d 180, 201 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); Roventini v. Ocular Sciences, Inc.,\n111 S.W.3d 719, 724 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\nAccordingly, the motion complied with rule 166a(i) and was sufficiently specific\nto warrant a no-evidence summary judgment on each of those claims and defenses.\nSee Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Holub, 264 S.W.3d at 201; Roventini, 111 S.W.3d at\n724.\n\n       3. Adequate time for discovery\n       Kang and the Lees also assert that the no-evidence summary judgment was\nimproper because they did not have adequate time to conduct discovery. We\ndisagree.\n\n       We review a trial court’s determination that there has been an adequate time\nfor discovery for an abuse of discretion. Specialty Realtors, Inc. v. Fuqua, 29\nS.W.3d 140, 145 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). Rule\n166a(i) does not require that discovery must have been completed, only that there\nwas “adequate time.” Id. A discovery period set by pretrial order should be\nadequate opportunity for discovery unless there is a showing to the contrary, and\nordinarily a motion would be permitted after the period but not before. Id. (citing\nTex. R. Civ. P. 166a cmt. to 1997 change). Whether adequate time for discovery\nhas passed is case specific. Id. We examine: the nature of the cause of action, the\nnature of the evidence necessary to controvert the no-evidence motion, and the\nlength of time the case had been active in the trial court. Id. We also may consider\n\n                                        10\n\fthe amount of time the no-evidence motion has been on file, whether the movant\nhas requested stricter time deadlines for discovery, the amount of discovery that\nhas already taken place, and whether the discovery deadlines that are in place are\nspecific or vague. Id.\n\n      Here, Derrick filed his suit against Kang on February 26, 2009, and amended\nto add the Lees on April 9, 2010. The primary dispute centered on breach of the\nLease. The original docket control order set the discovery deadline for January 1,\n2010, which was extended to December 17, 2010. This discovery period was\nspecific, and there is nothing in the record to indicate, nor do Kang and the Lees\nassert, that Derrick requested stricter deadlines. Derrick filed his no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment on December 29, 2010, 12 days after the extended\ndiscovery period ended and 22 months after he had originally filed suit, and the\ntrial court granted the motion on February 10, 2011, 42 days after it was filed.\n\n      Prior to the extended discovery deadline, Kang had only propounded\nrequests for disclosures and admissions, which Derrick responded to on November\n20, 2009. The Lees sent requests for production on November 16, 2010, which\nDerrick responded to on December 6, 2010. Kang did not propound any requests\nfor production until April 19, 2011, which Derrick responded to on May 16, 2011.\nDerrick’s deposition was not taken until March 8, 2011, after the no-evidence\nsummary judgment had been filed and indeed granted. See id. (deposition only\nnoticed after no-evidence summary judgment motion filed). And although Kang\nand the Lees also sent additional discovery requests and interrogatories, it was after\nthe discovery deadline had passed and the no-evidence summary judgment had\nbeen granted.\n\n      Furthermore, in their responses Kang and the Lees made no effort to specify\nthe additional evidence they needed to respond to the motion, aside from “drafts of\n\n                                         11\n\fthe leases and other documentation which exceeds the trial exhibits provided by\n[Derrick],” or the reason they could not obtain it during the discovery period, other\nthan due to Derrick’s “delay[ing] the discovery process.”             See Madison v.\nWilliamson, 241 S.W.3d 145, 155–56 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet.\ndenied) (no abuse of discretion where nonmovant “made no effort to specify the\nadditional evidence she needed to respond to the motion”); Carter v. MacFadyen,\n93 S.W.3d 307, 311 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (same\nwhere response did not indicate “what specific discovery needed to be\ncompleted”).\n\n      Considering all of the above factors, we cannot conclude it was an abuse of\nthe trial court’s discretion to conclude that an adequate time for discovery had\npassed. See Fuqua, 29 S.W.3d at 145.\n\n      4. Allegations of discovery abuse\n\n      In their responses to Derrick’s no-evidence motion, Kang and the Lees\ncontended they “would show that the Movant’s conduct has delayed the discovery\nprocess, therefore a no-evidence summary judgment is inappropriate.” However,\nalthough they cited Specialty Retailers, Inc. v. Fuqua, 4 Kang and the Lees\notherwise provided no specific argument to the trial court as to the allegedly\nabusive behavior by Derrick and merely cited to the entirety of an attached exhibit\n(an affidavit by Clayton).\n\n      Similarly on appeal, Kang and the Lees argue that Derrick resisted\nproducing discovery, and he should not be allowed to abuse the discovery process\nby withholding key evidence and then use that lack of evidence to win a no-\n\n      4\n        See 29 S.W.3d at 145 (“A party should not be able to abuse the discovery process,\nwithhold key evidence from their opponents, and then use that lack of evidence to win a\njudgment.”).\n\n                                           12\n\fevidence judgment. Also on appeal, Kang and the Lees continue to provide no\nspecific argument or citations to the record as to what behavior by Derrick\nconstituted misconduct or what allegedly withheld evidence was key, or explain\nhow any such evidence was key. They do little more than complain about the\ntardiness of the production of certain documents, most of which appear to have\nbeen produced by Derrick prior to the trial court’s decision to leave the grant of\nsummary judgment in place.5 However, Kang and the Lees do not explain how\nhaving this evidence prior to the trial court’s granting summary judgment would\nhave made any difference at all. Kang’s and Lee’s argument thus constitutes a\n“mere allegation” that Derrick abused the discovery process, which “is not\nsufficient to justify overturning the trial court’s ruling.” See Fuqua, 29 S.W.3d at\n146.\n\n       5. Kang and the Lees failed to specifically identify any supporting proof\n          in the summary judgment record.\n       Because Derrick’s motion was sufficient to warrant no-evidence summary\njudgment, the burden properly shifted to Kang and the Lees to respond to the\nmotion by producing more than a scintilla of evidence on each of the challenged\nelements. See Roventini, 111 S.W.3d at 724; Nowak v. DAS Inv. Corp., 110\nS.W.3d 677, 679 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (“A no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment shifts the burden of proof to the non-movant to raise\na genuine issue of material fact.”). We conclude that they failed to meet their\n       5\n          In their motions for rehearing, Kang and the Lees complained that “[i]t was not until\nafter the no-evidence partial summary judgment had been granted that [Derrick] began to deliver\nany relevant, material production/discovery” and argue that “[s]uch evidence would have refuted\nthe no-evidence allegation[s].” And in their supplemental response, Kang and the Lees\ndescribed Derrick’s denying the veracity of certain documents after he produced those\ndocuments after submission of the no-evidence motion as an example of his allegedly abusive\nconduct. They also complain of certain allegedly less-than-consistent admissions and objections\nby Derrick. However, they link none of this allegedly abusive behavior to any actual evidence,\nmuch less to its supposed importance in the context of the summary judgment.\n\n                                              13\n\fburden.\n\n      In determining whether the nonmovant raised more than a scintilla of\nevidence in support of his claims and affirmative defenses, “we are limited to the\nsummary judgment proof produced in the response.” Gonzales v. Servs. Lloyds\nIns. Co., No. 14-08-00377-CV, 2009 WL 1493039, at *2 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] May 21, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.). On appeal, Kang and the Lees\ncontend that the trial court erred by “insist[ing] that [they] somehow denominate\nwhat evidence supported which element of their claims and defenses.” However,\nthis is precisely what rule 166a(i) and our case law require. When a nonmovant\npresents summary judgment evidence in response to a no-evidence motion, that\nparty must specifically identify the supporting proof it seeks to have considered by\nthe trial court. Id. “[G]eneral citation to voluminous records is not a proper\nresponse to a no-evidence motion for summary judgment.” Eaton Metal Prods.,\nL.L.C. v. U.S. Denro Steels, Inc., No. 14-09-00757-CV, 2010 WL 3795192, at *6\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 30, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.). The trial\ncourt is not required to search the record for evidence raising a material fact issue\nwithout more specific guidance from the nonmovant. Lee v. Palacios, No. 14-06-\n00428-CV, 2007 WL 2990277, at *7 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 11,\n2007, pet. denied) (mem. op.); Blake v. Intco Invs. of Tex., Inc., 123 S.W.3d 521,\n525 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, no pet.).\n\n      Kang and the Lees filed responses to Derrick’s no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment. They attached to their responses: an affidavit by Kang with\nmultiple exhibits; an affidavit by Katie Lee with multiple exhibits; an affidavit by\nClayton, counsel for the Lees, with an exhibit; an “Accounting entitled K’s Art &\nFrame, Assuming Ne [sic] Lease Signed in 2005”; and an “Accounting by\ndefendants of amounts paid and charged.”         Kang and the Lees also filed a\n\n                                         14\n\fsupplemental affidavit by Clayton with an exhibit in support of their responses.\nThese affidavits and exhibits comprise a total of 196 pages. In their responses,\nKang and the Lees made no specific arguments as to any of their counterclaims or\naffirmative defenses, but instead generally argued: “There are multiple genuine\nissues of fact raised by the affidavits and exhibits in this Response.” Kang’s and\nthe Lees’ responses contain only one citation to any exhibit—to Clayton’s first\naffidavit with an exhibit—and it cites to the entirety of the exhibit.\n\n       The trial court granted Derrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment\nin an interlocutory order. Kang and the Lees then moved for rehearing. The trial\ncourt held a hearing on Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing, permitted\nthem to resend certain defective discovery requests to Derrick, and reset for at least\n60 days. The trial court specifically directed Kang and the Lees to “file a detailed\nSJ response with citations to SJ record in the body of the response.”\n\n       Four months later, Kang and the Lees filed supplemental responses to\nDerrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment. These responses had no\nattachments, but instead stated that they incorporated all affidavits and exhibits\nfrom the original and supplemental summary judgment responses, original and\nsupplemental motions to compel and for sanctions, and original motion for\ncontinuance. Although the supplemental responses included headings and\nargument as to each of their counterclaims and affirmative defenses, Kang and the\nLees once again cited to no specific evidence from the summary judgment record.\nIn addition, when arguing that adequate time for discovery had not passed, Kang\nand the Lees again cited to the entirety of a Clayton affidavit,6 and cited certain of\nDerrick’s discovery responses and certain pages of his deposition but did not\n\n       6\n          It is unclear which of the two Clayton affidavits is being cited. The citation also\nindicates such affidavit is attached as an exhibit, but it is not.\n\n                                             15\n\findicate where such documents could be located. The trial court signed an order\nleaving its earlier grant of interlocutory summary judgment in Derrick’s favor\nunchanged and denying Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing.\n\n         Kang’s and the Lees’ general citations were not sufficient to apprise the trial\ncourt of the summary judgment evidence on which they were supposedly relying.\nSee Eaton Metal, 2010 WL 3795192, at *6–7. Indeed, the trial court “stated more\nthan once at hearings in this case that it had no obligation, nor any inclination, to\nsift through more than 180 pages of supposed summary judgment evidence to try\nto find the facts asserted in” Kang’s and the Lees’ responses and supplemental\nresponses. Moreover, even on appeal, Kang and the Lees do not specifically cite to\nany summary judgment evidence that they believe creates a fact issue. See Blake,\n123 S.W.3d at 525 (“An appellant has a duty to show that the record supports her\ncontentions.”); see also Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). Consequently, we conclude that\nKang and the Lees failed to carry their burden to produce evidence, and the trial\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment against Kang’s and the Lees’\ncounterclaims and affirmative defenses. See Eaton Metal, 2010 WL 3795192, at\n*6–8; Gonzales, 2009 WL 1493039, at *2; Blake, 123 S.W.3d at 525.\n\n         We overrule Kang’s and the Lees’ first issue.\n\nB. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to compel discovery.\n\n         Next, Kang and the Lees argue, combined with their first and third issues,\nthat the trial court reversibly erred in denying their motions to compel. We do not\nagree.\n\n         The longstanding general rule is that a trial court’s denial of discovery is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Walker v. Schion, 420 S.W.3d 454, 458 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.); see Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279\n\n\n                                            16\n\fS.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2009) (“We review a trial court’s actions denying discovery\nfor an abuse of discretion.”). A trial court abuses its discretion when it reaches a\nresult so arbitrary and unreasonable that it amounts to a clear and prejudicial error\nof law. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d at 661.\n\n       The Lees’7 initial motion to compel simply complained of “limited\nresponse” and the lack of “proper objections” by Derrick to the Lees’ “request for\nproduction.” The Lees supplemented their motion with exhibits (the request for\nproduction and a letter from their counsel to Derrick), and then a supplemental\naffidavit from their counsel. According to the trial court’s docket sheet, the Lees\nwere then supposed to file a supplement to their motion “discussing the categories\nof outstanding documents in detail.” At the motion for rehearing of the no-\nevidence summary judgment, the trial court indicated that Kang and the Lees\nshould resend their defective discovery “with specific requests for categories of\ndocuments.”      Kang and the Lees then propounded additional requests.                   After\nDerrick responded, both Kang and the Lees filed supplemental motions to compel,\nattaching Derrick’s objections and responses. The trial court held a hearing on the\nmotions to compel and partially granted them.\n\n       In their brief, Kang and the Lees fail to direct this court to what specific\ndiscovery requests were at issue, what objections Derrick may have made to such\nrequests, and any legal basis for the trial court’s sustaining or overruling any\nobjection. They also provide no citation to authority and no analysis applying any\nauthority to the facts. Kang and the Lees essentially attempt to support their\ncontention that the trial court erred by recounting discussions that occurred during\nthe hearing on the motions to compel. However, the record reflects that despite its\n       7\n         The record does not contain an initial motion to compel filed by Kang, likely because he\ndid not propound any requests for production until after the no-evidence motion had been\ngranted.\n\n                                               17\n\fefforts to decipher the motions to compel, the trial court was having difficulty\nbecause Kang and the Lees were “not approaching these things from a standpoint\nof, let me tell you a logical story that goes in a linear fashion and explains to [the\ncourt] why [you’re] entitled to these things, why they’re relevant, and why\n[Derrick’s] objections, even annunciating what [his] objections are, are legally\nincorrect and here’s a case that says why they’re legally incorrect.”                Moreover,\ndespite the trial court’s difficulties, it in fact actually granted Kang’s and the Lees’\nmotions to compel in part—overruling Derrick’s objections with regard to certain\nrequests for production. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the\ntrial court acted so arbitrarily or unreasonably so as to abuse its discretion. See id.\n\n       We overrule Kang’s and the Lees’ second issue.\n\nC. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant sanctions.\n\n       In their third issue, combined with their first and second issues, Kang and\nthe Lees challenge the trial court’s denial of their motions for discovery sanctions.8\nHowever, they have not shown any clear abuse of discretion.\n\n       Imposing sanctions is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Koslow’s\nv. Mackie, 796 S.W.2d 700, 704 (Tex. 1990). In reviewing the propriety of\nsanctions, the appellate courts have repeatedly said we will not set aside a trial\ncourt’s decision on sanctions unless we find the trial court clearly abused its\ndiscretion. See id. This means the trial court acted without reference to any\nguiding rules and principles, or equivalently, whether under all the circumstances\n\n       8\n          The record indicates that the trial court twice denied Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for\nsanctions. The trial court first denied the motion for sanctions in conjunction with its partially\ngranting Kang’s and the Lees’ motions to compel. Kang and the Lees again moved for sanctions\nbased on Derrick’s failure to provide a certain document that the trial court had compelled.\nDerrick responded that he had provided such document. The trial court denied the second\nmotion for sanctions. While it is not exactly clear from Kang’s and the Lees’ briefs which\norder(s) are being challenged, we will interpret their issue to reach both orders.\n\n                                               18\n\fof the particular case the court’s action was arbitrary or unreasonable. Id. In\ndetermining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, we view the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the trial court and indulge every legal presumption in\nfavor of the judgment. See Omodele v. Adams, No. 14-01-00999-CV, 2003 WL\n133602, at *5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Jan. 16, 2003, no pet.) (mem. op.)\n(citing Parks v. U.S. Home, 652 S.W.2d 479, 485 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n1983, writ dism’d)).\n\n      Kang and the Lees lodge the general accusation that Derrick “should have\nbeen sanctioned rather than rewarded with a summary judgment by the Judge.”\nThey also argue that Derrick “disclosed and produced evidence affecting the issues\nconcerning the expiration of the Kang lease, the holdover clause of the Kang lease,\nlease renewal, and the existence of a new lease between” Derrick and the Lees\nafter the trial court granted no-evidence summary judgment. However, they fail to\nplace such alleged misconduct in the context of the court’s discovery deadlines,\naccount for the fact that the trial court found certain of their discovery requests\ndefective then permitted them to resend such discovery, or explain how such\nallegedly untimely responses otherwise affected the court’s granting summary\njudgment or any other outcome. See Koslow’s, 796 S.W.2d at 704. Nor do they\nanalyze such alleged behavior with reference to any record citations or legal\nauthority. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Kang and the Lees established\nthat the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying their motions for\ndiscovery sanctions against Derrick. See id. at 705.\n\n      We overrule Kang’s and the Lees’ third issue.\n\nD. The trial court did not err with regard to its final (not summary) judgment\n   on damages and attorney’s fees.\n      Kang alone argues the next two issues. In his fourth issue, Kang contends\n\n                                         19\n\fthat the trial court erred in “rendering summary judgment jointly and severally for\ndamages in favor of the plaintiff.” In his fifth issue, he argues that the trial court\n“erred in rendering summary judgment jointly and severally for attorney’s fees in\nfavor of the plaintiff.”\n\n      To begin, both of these issues are misguided in that the trial court did not\n“render” damages or attorney’s fees in any summary judgment. Rather, after a jury\ntrial where the jury awarded actual damages and attorney’s fees in favor of Derrick\nand against Kang and the Lees, the trial court signed a final judgment reflecting\nsuch verdict.\n\n      1. Actual damages\n\n      Next, presuming Kang was referring to the trial court’s final judgment, such\njudgment does not reflect that any actual damages were ordered to be paid jointly\nand severally among Kang and the Lees. Rather, the trial court ordered that\nDerrick recover: (1) $5425.14 plus prejudgment interest in actual damages from\nKang and (2) $96,908.60 plus prejudgment interest in actual damages from Katie\nLee and Scott Lee, jointly and severally.\n\n      Thus, we find no merit in, and overrule, Kang’s fourth issue.\n\n      2. Attorney’s fees\n\n      While Kang is correct in his reading of the final judgment that the trial court\nordered that Derek recover $24,600 in reasonable attorney’s fees and $10,000 in\nattorney’s fees in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, from Kang, Katie Lee, and\nScott Lee, jointly and severally, we conclude that the attorney’s fees award is\nsupported by the pleadings and the findings.\n\n          a. Segregation\n\n      Kang first argues that Derrick should have been required to segregate his\n                                            20\n\ffees in this case. Kang joined in the Lees’ jury-charge objection to question 10 on\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and their request that the question be\nbifurcated as to the Lees versus Kang. The trial court overruled the objection and\ndid not permit bifurcation, stating that the only expert testimony indicated the fees\ncould not be segregated.\n\n       The general rule is that a party seeking to recover attorney’s fees in a suit\ninvolving multiple claims or parties has a duty to segregate the fees owed. Stewart\nTitle Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10–11 (Tex. 1991). A recognized\nexception to the duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s fees rendered are in\nconnection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated\nthat their “prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.” Id. at 11 (quoting Flint & Assocs. v. Intercont’l Pipe & Steel, Inc., 739\nS.W.2d 622, 624–25 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied)). When the causes of\naction involved in the suit are dependent upon the same set of facts or\ncircumstances and thus are intertwined to the point of being inseparable, the party\nsuing for attorney’s fees may recover the entire amount covering all claims. See\nid. at 11–12.\n\n       Kang has not alleged that any of the attorney’s fees for any particular claims\nare unrecoverable. 9 Both claims arose from the same Lease, with Kang as the\nlessee and the Lees as his assignees. Moreover, Derrick’s attorney testified that\nKang and the Lees filed “identical” motions, discovery, virtually “everything that’s\nbeen filed.” Derrick’s attorney also testified that he did “the same amount of work\non essentially the same things, the same legal research, responding to the same\nmotions, responding to the same counterclaims.” Cf. Amerada Hess Corp. v. Wood\n\n       9\n         Article 32 of the Lease contemplates the recovery of attorney’s fees by the landlord\nfrom the tenant in case of breach.\n\n                                             21\n\fGroup Prod. Tech., 30 S.W.3d 5, 14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet.\ndenied) (remanding where no evidence presented to support exception to duty to\nsegregate). The record also confirms the interrelated nature of both Derrick’s\nprosecution against, and defense of the counterclaims of, Kang and the Lees.\n\n      Therefore, under these circumstances, we conclude that the attorney’s fees\nwere not conducive to or capable of segregation. See Oadra v. Stegall, 871 S.W.2d\n882, 888 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ) (“We have reviewed the\nentire record and after such review conclude that the attorney’s fees in this case\nwere not capable of segregation. The testimony in the record supports the finding\nthat the issues and parties in this case were so intertwined that they were\ninseparable.”).\n\n         b. Excessiveness\n\n      Kang also argues that ordering him to pay attorney’s fees jointly and\nseverally was not reasonable where his actual damages were a mere quarter of the\ntotal attorney’s fees. The determination of reasonable attorney’s fees is a question\nfor the trier of fact. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 12. The factfinder may consider\nvarious—and a litigant need not present evidence of all—factors when determining\nthe reasonableness of attorney’s fees. See Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip.\nCorp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997) (listing factors).\n\n      Derrick’s counsel presented testimony as to several of the Arthur Andersen\nfactors, including the time and labor involved, the novelty and difficulty of the\nquestions involved, the various legal issues that had to be addressed, his\nbackground, and the hourly rate charged. See id. Kang’s counsel did not cross-\nexamine Derrick’s counsel as to the reasonableness of his fees. Further, while the\naward should bear some reasonable relationship to the amount in controversy,\ndamages recovered is only one factor to be considered in measuring the\n                                        22\n\freasonableness of the amount of attorney’s fees recovered. Murrco Agency, Inc. v.\nRyan, 800 S.W.2d 600, 606–07 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, no writ) (rejecting\nexcessiveness challenge and upholding $92,000 attorney’s fees award as\nreasonable where actual damages award was approximately $28,000); see Bencon\nMgmt. & Gen. Contracting, Inc. v. Boyer, Inc., 178 S.W.3d 198, 209–10 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (same where attorney’s fees award was\n$282,000 and actual damages award was just over $81,000).\n\n      We conclude that the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s finding as to reasonable attorney’s fees. See Bencon Mgmt., 178\nS.W.3d at 210; Murrco Agency, 800 S.W.2d at 607.\n\n          c. Joint and several liability\n\n      Finally, Kang takes issue with the joint and several nature of the attorney’s\nfees among Kang and the Lees. Joint and several liability arises in contract based\nupon the relationship between the parties and the existence of what amounts to\njoint promises. K-Bar Servs., Inc. v. English, No. 03-05-00076-CV, 2006 WL\n903735, at *3 (Tex. App.—Austin Apr. 7, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing CTTI\nPriesmeyer, Inc. v. K & O Ltd. P’ship, 164 S.W.3d 675, 684 (Tex. App.—Austin\n2005, no pet.)).\n\n      Kang argues that “the facts and the jury charge herein were insufficient to\nwarrant assessment of liability as to Kang and as between Kang and the Lees[]\nherein.” However, the testimony relied on by Kang regarding the assignment of\nlease to the Lees and Kang’s lack of involvement with regard to the rented space\n(all without any record citations) does not support his position that joint and\nseveral liability was improper here. This is because liability to the original lessor\n(Derrick) for nonpayment of rent or lack of performance of other lease terms may\narise from either privity of contract or privity of estate. See Twelve Oaks Tower I,\n                                           23\n\fLtd. v. Premier Allergy, Inc., 938 S.W.2d 102, 113–14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 1996, no writ). While assignment of a lease destroys privity of estate\nbetween the lessor (Derrick) and the original lessee (Kang), privity of contract\nbetween them remains. See id. at 114.\n\n      Nor does the lack of a jury finding of the parties’ joint and several\nrelationship or their joint promise preclude a finding of the same where the jury\nfindings indicate that a single contract was under review. K-Bar Servs., 2006 WL\n903735, at *3. In questions 1 and 5, the jury found that both Kang and the Lees\nfailed to comply with the exact same lease—“the February 24, 2000 lease\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1).” Further, in question 7, the jury rejected that the Lees orally\nagreed to a month-to-month tenancy based on the same rent terms contained in an\nunsigned, draft lease.    The jury’s findings are also consistent with Derrick’s\namended petition, which sought to hold both Kang and the Lees liable for breach\nof the same Lease, and both Kang and the Lees liable for attorney’s fees under that\nsame Lease. See id. at *4. Thus, we conclude that joint and several liability is\nsupported by the pleadings and jury findings on the contract claims. See id.\n\n      We overrule Kang’s fifth issue.\n\n                             III.         CONCLUSION\n\n      Accordingly, having overruled all of Kang’s and all of the Lees’ issues on\nappeal, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n                                    /s/         Marc W.

DERRICK, Appellee\n\n                   On Appeal from the 151st District Court\n                           Harris County, Texas\n                     Trial Court Cause No. 2009-12226\n\n                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n      In this case, appellee Bruce W. Derrick brought suit against appellant Moon\nSun (Casey) Kang, and appellants Kathleen (Katie) Lee and Sang Pil (Scott) Lee\n(the “Lees”) for breach of a commercial lease agreement (the “Lease”). Kang and\nthe Lees brought assorted counterclaims and alleged various affirmative defenses.\nDerrick moved for no-evidence summary judgment as to Kang’s and the Lees’\n\fcounterclaims and affirmative defenses. The trial court granted Derrick’s no-\nevidence motion for summary judgment in an interlocutory order and later denied\nreconsideration of its order. At trial, the jury found that Kang failed to comply\nwith the lease, and that the Lees were assignees who consented to be bound by and\nfailed to comply with the lease. The jury awarded damages and attorney’s fees to\nDerrick, and the trial court rendered final judgment.\n\n         In this appeal, in three related issues, Kang and the Lees challenge the trial\ncourt’s grant of a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Derrick, and the\ncourt’s denial of their motions to compel and for sanctions. In addition, Kang\nargues that the trial court erred by rendering judgment for damages and attorney’s\nfees jointly and severally against him and the Lees. We affirm.\n\n                 I.      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n         On February 24, 2000, Derrick, as landlord, and Kang, as tenant, entered\ninto the Lease for commercial space located within a shopping center in Webster,\nTexas. In October 2004, the Lees began occupying the premises leased by Kang\nand began paying rent for the space. The Lees continued to occupy the space until\nthe end of the Lease in February 2005 and then remained on a month-to-month\nbasis.    The Lease was not modified, and no new lease agreement was ever\nexecuted. The Lees failed to timely pay all rent and other charges owed to Derrick\nunder the terms of the Lease. Ultimately, Derrick formally requested that the Lees\nvacate the premises.\n\n         In February 2009, Derrick filed suit for breach of the Lease against Kang.\nDerrick added the Lees as defendants in April 2010. Kang and the Lees filed\ncounterclaims for violations of the DTPA, fraud, fraud by nondisclosure, fraud in a\nreal estate transaction, and negligent misrepresentation. They also alleged various\naffirmative defenses: duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, waiver,\n                                            2\n\fpayment, laches, release, accord and satisfaction, and ratification.\n\n      On December 29, 2010, Derrick filed a motion for no-evidence summary\njudgment as to all of Kang’s and the Lees’ counterclaims and affirmative defenses.\nKang and the Lees responded, objecting that Derrick’s motion was untimely and\nthat it did not specify which elements of Kang’s and the Lees’ counterclaims and\ndefenses were being challenged. To their responses, Kang and the Lees attached:\nan affidavit by Kang with multiple exhibits; an affidavit by Katie Lee with multiple\nexhibits; an affidavit by Thomas Clayton, counsel for the Lees, with an exhibit; an\n“Accounting entitled K’s Art & Frame, Assuming Ne [sic] Lease Signed in 2005”;\nand an “Accounting by defendants of amounts paid and charged.” Kang and the\nLees also filed a motion to compel and for sanctions, a motion for continuance of\nthe summary judgment motion, and a “supplemental [Clayton] affidavit in support\nof” their responses and motions.\n\n      The trial court denied Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for continuance. The\ncourt granted Derrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment on February\n10, 2011. Kang and the Lees moved for rehearing. The trial court held a hearing\nin May 2011 and permitted Kang and the Lees to resend certain defective\ndiscovery. In September 2011, Kang and the Lees filed a supplemental response to\nDerrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment, as well as supplemental\nmotions to compel and for sanctions. On September 28, 2011, the trial court\ndenied Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing.\n\n      On October 26, 2011, the trial court granted Kang’s and the Lees’ motions to\ncompel in part and denied their motions for sanctions. Kang and the Lees again\nmoved for discovery sanctions, and the trial court denied their motions. A jury\ntrial was held in October 2012 on Derrick’s breach of the Lease claims, and the\njury found in favor of Derrick. Specifically, the jury found that Kang failed to\n\n                                          3\n\fcomply with the Lease, the Lees were assignees of the Lease, the Lees consented\nto the terms of the Lease, and the Lees failed to comply with the Lease. The jury\nawarded actual damages against Kang, actual damages against the Lees jointly and\nseverally, and attorney’s fees against Kang and the Lees jointly and severally. The\ntrial court signed its final judgment based on the jury’s verdict. Kang and the Lees\nboth appealed.\n\n                               II.      ANALYSIS\n\n      In their first three issues, which they group together in their briefs, Kang and\nthe Lees argue that the trial court erred in granting Derrick’s no-evidence motion\nfor summary judgment on their counterclaims and affirmative defenses, and erred\nin denying Kang’s and the Lees’ motions to compel and for sanctions.              We\ndisagree.\n\nA. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.\n\n      1. Rule 166a(i) requirements and standard of review\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, the party without the burden of proof\nmay, without presenting evidence, move for summary judgment on the ground that\nthere is no evidence to support an essential element of the nonmovant’s claim or\ndefense. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). A no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n“must state the elements as to which there is no evidence.” Id. A no-evidence\nmotion should not be general or conclusory. Id. 166a cmt. to 1997 change.\n\n      A no-evidence motion for summary judgment must be granted if: (1) the\nmoving party asserts that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of\na claim or defense on which the adverse party would have the burden of proof at\ntrial, and (2) the respondent produces no summary judgment evidence raising a\ngenuine issue of material fact on those elements. See id. 166a(i). We review a no-\n\n                                          4\n\fevidence summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmovant. Smith v.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894501\"><a href=\"/opinion/894501/ford-motor-co-v-ridgway/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (Tex. 2004). A no-evidence summary judgment motion may not\nproperly be granted if the nonmovant brings forth more than a scintilla of evidence\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact on the challenged elements. Ridgway, 135\nS.W.3d at 600. More than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence “rises to\na level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their\nconclusions.” Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 711.\n\n      2. Specificity of the no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n      First, Kang and the Lees argue that Derrick’s no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment “did not specifically allege nor challenge the specific claim or\ndefense, or element thereof, of the Appellants of which there is no evidence.” We\nfind no merit in this argument.\n\n      Derrick’s no-evidence motion tracked Kang’s and the Lees’ pleadings and\nidentified their theories of liability as follows: violations of the DTPA; fraud\n(common-law, by nondisclosure, and in a real estate transaction); and negligent\n\n                                        5\n\fmisrepresentation.\n\n      With respect to the DTPA claims, Derrick asserted there was no evidence\nthat: the Lees were consumers; Derrick committed a false, misleading, or deceptive\nact under section 17.46(b) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, or engaged\nin an unconscionable act or practice; and Derrick’s alleged actions were a\nproducing cause of Kang’s and the Lees’ alleged injuries.

U.S.\nBrass Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459736\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459736/amstadt-v-us-brass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      With respect to the common-law fraud claims, Derrick argued there was no\nevidence that: a material representation was made, it was false, Derrick knew it\nwas false or made the representation recklessly, and he made the representation\nwith intent that Kang and the Lees act on it. See Lundy v. Mason, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1875950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1875950/lundy-v-masson/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n492 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n\n      With respect to the fraud by nondisclosure claims, Derrick asserted there\nwas no evidence that: Derrick concealed or failed to disclose material facts within\nhis knowledge or he knew Kang and the Lees did not have an equal opportunity to\ndiscover the truth; and Derrick intended to induce Kang and the Lees to take some\naction. See McCarthy v. Wani Venture, A.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192163\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192163/mccarthy-v-wani-venture-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585–89 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\n\n      With respect to the fraud in a real estate transaction claims, Derrick asserted\nthere was no evidence that he made any misrepresentations, false promises, or\nnondisclosures to Kang and the Lees for the purpose of inducing them into entering\na contract. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 27.01 (West 2009).\n\n      With respect to the negligent misrepresentation claims, Derrick argued there\nwas no evidence that: he supplied “false information” for the guidance of Kang and\nthe Lees in their business; and Derrick provided a misstatement of existing fact,\n\n\n                                         6\n\fwhich caused an alleged injury, independent of any breach of contract claim.

(mem. op.).\n\n      With respect to damages, Derrick also asserted there was no evidence of:\nout-of-pocket or reliance damages—that Kang and the Lees gave something, the\nfair market value of which was more than they received; “benefit of the bargain\ndamages”; and damages for loss of credit or damage to their credit reputation.\nWith respect to Kang’s and the Lees’ request for “multiple damages,” Derrick\nargued there was no evidence that: he acted with actual awareness of any alleged\nfalsity, deception, or unfairness of an act or practice. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\nAnn. § 17.45(9) (West 2011) (knowing violation). And there was no evidence\nDerrick acted with actual awareness of any alleged falsity, deception, or unfairness\nof an act or practice or of a condition of defect constituting a breach of warranty,\nand with the specific intent of having Kang and the Lees act in detrimental reliance\non any alleged falsity or deception or in detrimental ignorance of the unfairness.\nSee id. § 17.45(13) (intentional violation).\n\n      Derrick’s motion further identified Kang’s 1 and the Lees’ 2 affirmative\ndefenses as follows: duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, waiver,\npayment, laches, release, accord and satisfaction, and ratification. With respect to\nduress, Derrick argued there was no evidence that: he made a threat or acted\nwithout legal justification against the Lees to destroy their free agency; and\n\n      1\n          Kang did not plead duress, failure of consideration, or waiver.\n      2\n          The Lees did not plead accord and satisfaction, or ratification.\n\n                                                  7\n\fDerrick threatened or acted against the Lees to overcome their free will.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). Rule\n166a(i) does not require that discovery must have been completed, only that there\nwas “adequate time.” Id. A discovery period set by pretrial order should be\nadequate opportunity for discovery unless there is a showing to the contrary, and\nordinarily a motion would be permitted after the period but not before. Id. (citing\nTex. R. Civ. P. 166a cmt. to 1997 change). Whether adequate time for discovery\nhas passed is case specific. Id. We examine: the nature of the cause of action, the\nnature of the evidence necessary to controvert the no-evidence motion, and the\nlength of time the case had been active in the trial court. Id. We also may consider\n\n                                        10\n\fthe amount of time the no-evidence motion has been on file, whether the movant\nhas requested stricter time deadlines for discovery, the amount of discovery that\nhas already taken place, and whether the discovery deadlines that are in place are\nspecific or vague. Id.\n\n      Here, Derrick filed his suit against Kang on February 26, 2009, and amended\nto add the Lees on April 9, 2010. The primary dispute centered on breach of the\nLease. The original docket control order set the discovery deadline for January 1,\n2010, which was extended to December 17, 2010. This discovery period was\nspecific, and there is nothing in the record to indicate, nor do Kang and the Lees\nassert, that Derrick requested stricter deadlines. Derrick filed his no-evidence\nmotion for summary judgment on December 29, 2010, 12 days after the extended\ndiscovery period ended and 22 months after he had originally filed suit, and the\ntrial court granted the motion on February 10, 2011, 42 days after it was filed.\n\n      Prior to the extended discovery deadline, Kang had only propounded\nrequests for disclosures and admissions, which Derrick responded to on November\n20, 2009. The Lees sent requests for production on November 16, 2010, which\nDerrick responded to on December 6, 2010. Kang did not propound any requests\nfor production until April 19, 2011, which Derrick responded to on May 16, 2011.\nDerrick’s deposition was not taken until March 8, 2011, after the no-evidence\nsummary judgment had been filed and indeed granted. See id. (deposition only\nnoticed after no-evidence summary judgment motion filed). And although Kang\nand the Lees also sent additional discovery requests and interrogatories, it was after\nthe discovery deadline had passed and the no-evidence summary judgment had\nbeen granted.\n\n      Furthermore, in their responses Kang and the Lees made no effort to specify\nthe additional evidence they needed to respond to the motion, aside from “drafts of\n\n                                         11\n\fthe leases and other documentation which exceeds the trial exhibits provided by\n[Derrick],” or the reason they could not obtain it during the discovery period, other\nthan due to Derrick’s “delay[ing] the discovery process.”             See Madison v.\nWilliamson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872558\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872558/madison-v-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155–56 (Tex.

Allegations of discovery abuse\n\n      In their responses to Derrick’s no-evidence motion, Kang and the Lees\ncontended they “would show that the Movant’s conduct has delayed the discovery\nprocess, therefore a no-evidence summary judgment is inappropriate.” However,\nalthough they cited Specialty Retailers, Inc. v. Fuqua, 4 Kang and the Lees\notherwise provided no specific argument to the trial court as to the allegedly\nabusive behavior by Derrick and merely cited to the entirety of an attached exhibit\n(an affidavit by Clayton).\n\n      Similarly on appeal, Kang and the Lees argue that Derrick resisted\nproducing discovery, and he should not be allowed to abuse the discovery process\nby withholding key evidence and then use that lack of evidence to win a no-\n\n      4\n        See 29 S.W.3d at 145 (“A party should not be able to abuse the discovery process,\nwithhold key evidence from their opponents, and then use that lack of evidence to win a\njudgment.”).\n\n                                           12\n\fevidence judgment. Also on appeal, Kang and the Lees continue to provide no\nspecific argument or citations to the record as to what behavior by Derrick\nconstituted misconduct or what allegedly withheld evidence was key, or explain\nhow any such evidence was key. They do little more than complain about the\ntardiness of the production of certain documents, most of which appear to have\nbeen produced by Derrick prior to the trial court’s decision to leave the grant of\nsummary judgment in place.5 However, Kang and the Lees do not explain how\nhaving this evidence prior to the trial court’s granting summary judgment would\nhave made any difference at all. Kang’s and Lee’s argument thus constitutes a\n“mere allegation” that Derrick abused the discovery process, which “is not\nsufficient to justify overturning the trial court’s ruling.” See Fuqua, 29 S.W.3d at\n146.\n\n       5. Kang and the Lees failed to specifically identify any supporting proof\n          in the summary judgment record.\n       Because Derrick’s motion was sufficient to warrant no-evidence summary\njudgment, the burden properly shifted to Kang and the Lees to respond to the\nmotion by producing more than a scintilla of evidence on each of the challenged\nelements.

They attached to their responses: an affidavit by Kang with\nmultiple exhibits; an affidavit by Katie Lee with multiple exhibits; an affidavit by\nClayton, counsel for the Lees, with an exhibit; an “Accounting entitled K’s Art &\nFrame, Assuming Ne [sic] Lease Signed in 2005”; and an “Accounting by\ndefendants of amounts paid and charged.”         Kang and the Lees also filed a\n\n                                         14\n\fsupplemental affidavit by Clayton with an exhibit in support of their responses.\nThese affidavits and exhibits comprise a total of 196 pages. In their responses,\nKang and the Lees made no specific arguments as to any of their counterclaims or\naffirmative defenses, but instead generally argued: “There are multiple genuine\nissues of fact raised by the affidavits and exhibits in this Response.” Kang’s and\nthe Lees’ responses contain only one citation to any exhibit—to Clayton’s first\naffidavit with an exhibit—and it cites to the entirety of the exhibit.\n\n       The trial court granted Derrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment\nin an interlocutory order. Kang and the Lees then moved for rehearing. The trial\ncourt held a hearing on Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing, permitted\nthem to resend certain defective discovery requests to Derrick, and reset for at least\n60 days. The trial court specifically directed Kang and the Lees to “file a detailed\nSJ response with citations to SJ record in the body of the response.”\n\n       Four months later, Kang and the Lees filed supplemental responses to\nDerrick’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment. These responses had no\nattachments, but instead stated that they incorporated all affidavits and exhibits\nfrom the original and supplemental summary judgment responses, original and\nsupplemental motions to compel and for sanctions, and original motion for\ncontinuance. Although the supplemental responses included headings and\nargument as to each of their counterclaims and affirmative defenses, Kang and the\nLees once again cited to no specific evidence from the summary judgment record.\nIn addition, when arguing that adequate time for discovery had not passed, Kang\nand the Lees again cited to the entirety of a Clayton affidavit,6 and cited certain of\nDerrick’s discovery responses and certain pages of his deposition but did not\n\n       6\n          It is unclear which of the two Clayton affidavits is being cited.

The trial court signed an order\nleaving its earlier grant of interlocutory summary judgment in Derrick’s favor\nunchanged and denying Kang’s and the Lees’ motions for rehearing.\n\n         Kang’s and the Lees’ general citations were not sufficient to apprise the trial\ncourt of the summary judgment evidence on which they were supposedly relying.\nSee Eaton Metal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3795192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6–7.

Moreover, even on appeal, Kang and the Lees do not specifically cite to\nany summary judgment evidence that they believe creates a fact issue. See Blake,\n123 S.W.3d at 525 (“An appellant has a duty to show that the record supports her\ncontentions.”); see also Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).

A trial court abuses its discretion when it reaches a\nresult so arbitrary and unreasonable that it amounts to a clear and prejudicial error\nof law. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d at 661.\n\n       The Lees’7 initial motion to compel simply complained of “limited\nresponse” and the lack of “proper objections” by Derrick to the Lees’ “request for\nproduction.” The Lees supplemented their motion with exhibits (the request for\nproduction and a letter from their counsel to Derrick), and then a supplemental\naffidavit from their counsel. According to the trial court’s docket sheet, the Lees\nwere then supposed to file a supplement to their motion “discussing the categories\nof outstanding documents in detail.” At the motion for rehearing of the no-\nevidence summary judgment, the trial court indicated that Kang and the Lees\nshould resend their defective discovery “with specific requests for categories of\ndocuments.”      Kang and the Lees then propounded additional requests.                   After\nDerrick responded, both Kang and the Lees filed supplemental motions to compel,\nattaching Derrick’s objections and responses. The trial court held a hearing on the\nmotions to compel and partially granted them.\n\n       In their brief, Kang and the Lees fail to direct this court to what specific\ndiscovery requests were at issue, what objections Derrick may have made to such\nrequests, and any legal basis for the trial court’s sustaining or overruling any\nobjection. They also provide no citation to authority and no analysis applying any\nauthority to the facts. Kang and the Lees essentially attempt to support their\ncontention that the trial court erred by recounting discussions that occurred during\nthe hearing on the motions to compel. However, the record reflects that despite its\n       7\n         The record does not contain an initial motion to compel filed by Kang, likely because he\ndid not propound any requests for production until after the no-evidence motion had been\ngranted.\n\n                                               17\n\fefforts to decipher the motions to compel, the trial court was having difficulty\nbecause Kang and the Lees were “not approaching these things from a standpoint\nof, let me tell you a logical story that goes in a linear fashion and explains to [the\ncourt] why [you’re] entitled to these things, why they’re relevant, and why\n[Derrick’s] objections, even annunciating what [his] objections are, are legally\nincorrect and here’s a case that says why they’re legally incorrect.”                Moreover,\ndespite the trial court’s difficulties, it in fact actually granted Kang’s and the Lees’\nmotions to compel in part—overruling Derrick’s objections with regard to certain\nrequests for production. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the\ntrial court acted so arbitrarily or unreasonably so as to abuse its discretion. See id.\n\n       We overrule Kang’s and the Lees’ second issue.\n\nC. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant sanctions.\n\n       In their third issue, combined with their first and second issues, Kang and\nthe Lees challenge the trial court’s denial of their motions for discovery sanctions.8\nHowever, they have not shown any clear abuse of discretion.\n\n       Imposing sanctions is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.

Kang and the Lees again moved for sanctions\nbased on Derrick’s failure to provide a certain document that the trial court had compelled.\nDerrick responded that he had provided such document. The trial court denied the second\nmotion for sanctions.

However, they fail to\nplace such alleged misconduct in the context of the court’s discovery deadlines,\naccount for the fact that the trial court found certain of their discovery requests\ndefective then permitted them to resend such discovery, or explain how such\nallegedly untimely responses otherwise affected the court’s granting summary\njudgment or any other outcome. See Koslow’s, 796 S.W.2d at 704. Nor do they\nanalyze such alleged behavior with reference to any record citations or legal\nauthority. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Kang and the Lees established\nthat the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying their motions for\ndiscovery sanctions against Derrick. See id. at 705.\n\n      We overrule Kang’s and the Lees’ third issue.\n\nD. The trial court did not err with regard to its final (not summary) judgment\n   on damages and attorney’s fees.\n      Kang alone argues the next two issues. In his fourth issue, Kang contends\n\n                                         19\n\fthat the trial court erred in “rendering summary judgment jointly and severally for\ndamages in favor of the plaintiff.” In his fifth issue, he argues that the trial court\n“erred in rendering summary judgment jointly and severally for attorney’s fees in\nfavor of the plaintiff.”\n\n      To begin, both of these issues are misguided in that the trial court did not\n“render” damages or attorney’s fees in any summary judgment. Rather, after a jury\ntrial where the jury awarded actual damages and attorney’s fees in favor of Derrick\nand against Kang and the Lees, the trial court signed a final judgment reflecting\nsuch verdict.\n\n      1. Actual damages\n\n      Next, presuming Kang was referring to the trial court’s final judgment, such\njudgment does not reflect that any actual damages were ordered to be paid jointly\nand severally among Kang and the Lees. Rather, the trial court ordered that\nDerrick recover: (1) $5425.14 plus prejudgment interest in actual damages from\nKang and (2) $96,908.60 plus prejudgment interest in actual damages from Katie\nLee and Scott Lee, jointly and severally.\n\n      Thus, we find no merit in, and overrule, Kang’s fourth issue.\n\n      2. Attorney’s fees\n\n      While Kang is correct in his reading of the final judgment that the trial court\nordered that Derek recover $24,600 in reasonable attorney’s fees and $10,000 in\nattorney’s fees in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, from Kang, Katie Lee, and\nScott Lee, jointly and severally, we conclude that the attorney’s fees award is\nsupported by the pleadings and the findings.\n\n          a. Segregation\n\n      Kang first argues that Derrick should have been required to segregate his\n                                            20\n\ffees in this case. Kang joined in the Lees’ jury-charge objection to question 10 on\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and their request that the question be\nbifurcated as to the Lees versus Kang. The trial court overruled the objection and\ndid not permit bifurcation, stating that the only expert testimony indicated the fees\ncould not be segregated.\n\n       The general rule is that a party seeking to recover attorney’s fees in a suit\ninvolving multiple claims or parties has a duty to segregate the fees owed.

A recognized\nexception to the duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s fees rendered are in\nconnection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated\nthat their “prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.” Id. at 11 (quoting Flint & Assocs. v.

When the causes of\naction involved in the suit are dependent upon the same set of facts or\ncircumstances and thus are intertwined to the point of being inseparable, the party\nsuing for attorney’s fees may recover the entire amount covering all claims. See\nid. at 11–12.\n\n       Kang has not alleged that any of the attorney’s fees for any particular claims\nare unrecoverable. 9 Both claims arose from the same Lease, with Kang as the\nlessee and the Lees as his assignees. Moreover, Derrick’s attorney testified that\nKang and the Lees filed “identical” motions, discovery, virtually “everything that’s\nbeen filed.” Derrick’s attorney also testified that he did “the same amount of work\non essentially the same things, the same legal research, responding to the same\nmotions, responding to the same counterclaims.” Cf.

Joint and several liability\n\n      Finally, Kang takes issue with the joint and several nature of the attorney’s\nfees among Kang and the Lees. Joint and several liability arises in contract based\nupon the relationship between the parties and the existence of what amounts to\njoint promises. K-Bar Servs., Inc. v. English, No. 03-05-00076-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">903735</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Tex.

App.—Austin\n2005, no pet.)).\n\n      Kang argues that “the facts and the jury charge herein were insufficient to\nwarrant assessment of liability as to Kang and as between Kang and the Lees[]\nherein.” However, the testimony relied on by Kang regarding the assignment of\nlease to the Lees and Kang’s lack of involvement with regard to the rented space\n(all without any record citations) does not support his position that joint and\nseveral liability was improper here. This is because liability to the original lessor\n(Derrick) for nonpayment of rent or lack of performance of other lease terms may\narise from either privity of contract or privity of estate. See Twelve Oaks Tower I,\n                                           23\n\fLtd. v. Premier Allergy, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369929/twelve-oaks-tower-i-v-premier-allergy/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113–14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 1996, no writ). While assignment of a lease destroys privity of estate\nbetween the lessor (Derrick) and the original lessee (Kang), privity of contract\nbetween them remains. See id. at 114.\n\n      Nor does the lack of a jury finding of the parties’ joint and several\nrelationship or their joint promise preclude a finding of the same where the jury\nfindings indicate that a single contract was under review. K-Bar Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">903735</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. In questions 1 and 5, the jury found that both Kang and the Lees\nfailed to comply with the exact same lease—“the February 24, 2000 lease\n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1).” Further, in question 7, the jury rejected that the Lees orally\nagreed to a month-to-month tenancy based on the same rent terms contained in an\nunsigned, draft lease.    The jury’s findings are also consistent with Derrick’s\namended petition, which sought to hold both Kang and the Lees liable for breach\nof the same Lease, and both Kang and the Lees liable for attorney’s fees under that\nsame Lease. See id. at *4. Thus, we conclude that joint and several liability is\nsupported by the pleadings and jury findings on the contract claims. See id.\n\n      We overrule Kang’s fifth issue.\n\n                             III.
