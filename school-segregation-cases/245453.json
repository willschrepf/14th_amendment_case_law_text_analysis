Plaintiffs, Lloyd and Vina Payne (the Paynes), sue defendants, James A. Collins, Wayne Scott, Keith Price and Essie Johnson, all of whom are former or current Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) officials, individually under Section 1983 of Title 42 to the United States Code (Section 1983)<sup>[1]</sup> for failing to protect their son, Randy Payne, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<sup>[2]</sup> Pls.' Second Am. Compl. and Req. for Jury; Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. [hereinafter Resp.].</p>\n<p>2. Collins, Scott, Price and Johnson move for summary judgment. They initially argue that this case's record fails to establish them as liable for any Eighth Amendment breach. They then contend that, even if they committed constitutional violations, they should receive qualified immunity.<sup>[3]</sup> Mot.; Defs.' Reply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1042</span> to Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. [hereinafter Reply].</p>\n<p>3. The court grants the motion for summary judgment [62] in part and denies it in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</i></h2>\n<p>4. \"Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that a grant of summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Pollock v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp.,</i> 17 F.3d 798, 803 (5th Cir.1994). \"The mere existence of a factual dispute does not by itself preclude the granting of summary judgment. `[T]he requirement is that there be no <i>genuine</i> issue of <i>material</i> fact.'\" <i>St. Amant v. Benoit,</i> 806 F.2d 1294, 1297 (5th Cir.1987). \"The substantive law ... identif[ies] which facts are material.\" <i>Forsyth v. Barr,</i> 19 F.3d 1527, 1533 (5th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 513 U.S. 871, 115 S.Ct. 195, 130 L.Ed.2d 127 (1994); <i>see </i><i>Texas Manufactured Hous. Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Nederland,</i> 101 F.3d 1095, 1099 (5th Cir.1996) (\"A fact is `material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 117 S.Ct. 2497, 138 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1997). \"There is no genuine issue of material fact if the evidence is such that, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant, ... a reasonable jury could not return a verdict in his [or her] favor.\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>Atkinson v. Denton Pub. Co.,</i> 84 F.3d 144, 148 (5th Cir.1996); <i>see </i><i>Texas Manufactured Hous. Ass'n,</i> 101 F.3d at 1099 (\"An issue is `genuine' if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\").</p>\n<p>5. The operation of the summary judgment standard varies. <i>See </i><i>International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally's, Inc.,</i> 939 F.2d 1257, 1263-65 (5th Cir.1991), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 1059, 112 S.Ct. 936, 117 L.Ed.2d 107 (1992). For example, in this suit, the framework associated with \"run-of-the-mill civil cases\" guides analysis of the direct challenges to the Paynes' Eighth Amendment claims, while a another approach informs consideration of the assertions of qualified immunity. A difference in where the burden of proof is placed in an Eighth Amendment claim and in a qualified immunity defense explains this circumstance. <i>Compare infra</i> ¶ 33 (disclosing that the plaintiff alone bears the burden of proof on an Eighth Amendment claim brought under Section 1983) <i>with </i><i>Salas v. Carpenter,</i> 980 F.2d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1992) (describing the \"shifting burden of proof\" for qualified immunity).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Application of the Summary Judgment Standard When the Movant-Defendant Challenges Constitutional Claims: The \"Run-of-the-Mill\" Civil Case Approach</i></h2>\n<p>6. \"In the `run-of-the-mill' civil case, [such as one alleging an Eighth Amendment violation brought under Section 1983,] the defendant moves for summary judgment on the ground that the evidence in the record demonstrates that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of lawthat should the case proceed to trial, the plaintiff will not sustain its burden of proof and the court will necessarily direct a verdict in its favor.\" <i>International Shortstop,</i> 939 F.2d at 1264. To show that the evidence mandates summary judgment in its favor, the defendant either \"affirmatively offer[s] evidence which undermines one of the essential elements of the plaintiff's case; or, ... simply demonstrate[s] that the evidence in the record falls short of establishing an essential element of the plaintiff's case,\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>id.; see </i><i>Topalian v. Ehrman,</i> 954 F.2d 1125, 1131 (5th Cir.) (party moving for summary judgment carries its burden \"by informing the court of the basis for its motion, and by identifying portions of the record which highlight the absence of genuine factual issues\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 506 U.S. 825, 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992). When <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1043</span> the defendant makes a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff \"must bring forward ... `significant probative evidence'\" to create a genuine issue of material fact.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Gutterman,</i> 896 F.2d at 118; <i>accord </i><i>Texas Manufactured Hous. Ass'n,</i> 101 F.3d at 1099. It \"need not offer all of the evidence tending to support its case, only enough evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in [its] favor.\" <i>International Shortstop,</i> 939 F.2d at 1264. It \"can satisfy [this] ... burden by tendering depositions, affidavits or other competent evidence,\" <i>Topalian,</i> 954 F.2d at 1132, or \"by referring to evidentiary documents already in the record,\" <i>Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, Inc.,</i> 910 F.2d 167, 178 (5th Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 859, 114 S.Ct. 171, 126 L.Ed.2d 131 (1993).<sup>[7]</sup><i>Accord </i><i>International Shortstop,</i> 939 F.2d at 1263-64. The plaintiff's showing, however, \"must [raise] ... more than a metaphysical doubt about the material facts,\" <i>Washington v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc.,</i> 839 F.2d 1121, 1123 (5th Cir.1988), and must constitute more than a \"mere scintilla of evidence,\" <i>Spiller v. Ella Smithers Geriatric Ctr.,</i> 919 F.2d 339, 343 (5th Cir.1990). Moreover, the plaintiff cannot elude the defendant's properly supported summary judgment motion by presenting \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\"<sup>[8]</sup><i>Krim v. BancTexas Group, Inc.,</i> 989 F.2d 1435, 1439 (5th Cir.1993); <i>accord </i><i>Galindo v. Precision Am. Corp.,</i> 754 F.2d 1212, 1216 (5th Cir.1985) (\"In fact, unsupported allegations or affidavits setting forth `ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law' are insufficient to either support or defeat a motion for summary judgment.\"); <i>see </i><i>Grimes v. Texas Dep't of Mental Health and Mental Retardation,</i> 102 F.3d 137, 139 (5th Cir.1996) (\"Needless to say, unsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence.\"), or by \"claim[ing] that further discovery or a trial might reveal facts [of] which [it] ... is currently unaware,\" <i>Armstrong Indus.,</i> 839 F.2d at 1123. When the plaintiff fails to meet its evidentiary burden, entry of summary judgment for the defendant results. <i>Topalian,</i> 954 F.2d at 1131; <i>Fields v. City of South Houston, Tex.,</i> 922 F.2d 1183, 1187 (5th Cir.1991); <i>Fontenot v. Upjohn Co.,</i> 780 F.2d 1190, 1195-96 (5th Cir.1986); <i>see </i><i>Little,</i> 37 F.3d at 1075 (When the nonmovant provides no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact, the court \"<i>do[es] not ... assume that the nonmovant could or would prove the necessary facts.\"</i> Rather, it enters summary judgment for the movant.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Application of the Summary Judgment Standard When the Movant-Defendant Asserts Qualified Immunity</i></h2>\n<p>7. \"Public officials whose positions entail the exercise of discretion enjoy the defense of qualified immunity in § 1983 actions.\" <i>Whatley v. Philo,</i> 817 F.2d 19, 20 (5th Cir.1987). \"In essence, qualified immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1044</span> `reconcile[s] two competing interests. One interest is the compensation of persons whose federally protected rights have been violated. Opposing this is the fear that personal liability will inhibit public officials in the discharge of their duties.'\" <i>Caffey v. Johnson,</i> 883 F.Supp. 128, 132 (E.D.Tex. 1995) (quoting <i>Johnston v. City Houston,</i> 14 F.3d 1056, 1059 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p>8. The question of \"[w]hether [or not] a defendant [government official] asserting qualified immunity may be personally liable turns on the objective legal reasonableness of [his or her] ... actions assessed in light of clearly established law.\" <i>Pfannstiel v. City of Marion,</i> 918 F.2d 1178, 1183 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<blockquote>[Under this standard,] the [defendant's] ... conduct is measured with reference to the law as it existed at the time of the conduct in question. Therefore, the right the [defendant] ... is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established at the time of the occurrence. The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear so that a reasonable official would understand that what he [or she] is doing violates that right. If, upon viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [plaintiff] ..., reasonable public officials could differ on the lawfulness of the defendant's actions, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Harper v. Harris County, Tex.,</i> 21 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.1994); <i>accord </i><i>Spann v. Rainey,</i> 987 F.2d 1110, 1114 (5th Cir.1993) (\"The contour, or standard, for a constitutional right may expand after the time of the alleged violation; but as stated, the benchmark for objective reasonableness is that which existed at the time of the alleged violation we look to clearly established law at that time.\").</p>\n<p>9. No hard and fast rule defines the body of law to consult to determine if a constitutional right was clearly established when the purported wrong occurred. <i>Melear v. Spears,</i> 862 F.2d 1177, 1184 n. 8 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<blockquote>Relying solely on Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court cases, for example, [is] ... excessively formalistic, but they [do] ... loom largest in [a court's] ... inquiries. In determining what the relevant law is, then, a court must necessarily exercise some discretion in determining the relevance of particular law under the facts and circumstances of each case, looking at such factors as the overall weight of authority, and the status of the courts that render substantively relevant decisions, as well as the jurisdiction of the courts that render substantively relevant decisions.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.; see </i><i>Boddie v. City of Columbus, Miss.,</i> 989 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir.1993) (\"Our inquiry ends, if we find from examining the decisions of the Supreme Court and our own decisions that the law was clearly established in this circuit.\"). Moreover, a right may have been clearly established at the time of the events at issue \"even if the `very action in question' had not then been held to be a constitutional violation.\" <i>Foster v. City of Lake Jackson,</i> 28 F.3d 425, 429 (5th Cir. 1994); <i>accord </i><i>Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 15 F.3d 443, 455 (5th Cir.) (\"The term `clearly established' does not necessarily refer to `commanding precedent' that is `factually on all-fours with the case at bar,' or that holds the `very action in question' unlawful. Rather, a constitutional right is clearly established if `in light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness [is] apparent.' Put another way, officials must observe `general well-developed legal principles.'\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 513 U.S. 815, 115 S.Ct. 70, 130 L.Ed.2d 25 (1994).</p>\n<p>10. When the defendant moves for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, he or she first must \"plead[] his [or her] good faith and establish that he [or she] was acting within the scope of his [or her] discretionary authority when the alleged wrongful acts occurred.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>Saldana v. Garza,</i> 684 F.2d 1159, 1163 &amp; n. 14 (5th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1045</span> Cir.1982), <i>cert. denied,</i> 460 U.S. 1012, 103 S.Ct. 1253, 75 L.Ed.2d 481 (1983); <i>see </i><i>Blackwell v.

Reynolds,</i> 703 F.Supp. 583, 588 (N.D.Tex.1988) (the defendant will \"present[] evidence support[ing] his [or her] claim of qualified immunity\"). If he or she does so, then the plaintiff must \"come forward with summary judgment evidence sufficient to sustain a determination that [the defendant's] ... actions violated clearly established law.\" <i>Blackwell,</i> 34 F.3d at 301; <i>accord Gunn,</i> 1997 WL 30900, at *1; <i>see McCoy v.

In other words, the plaintiff must provide significant probative evidence showing that the defendant acted in an objectively unreasonable manner in light of a constitutional right clearly established at the time of the purported wrong. <i>See </i><i>Eugene v. Alief Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 65 F.3d 1299, 1305 (5th Cir.1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> 517 U.S. 1191, 116 S.Ct. 1680, 134 L.Ed.2d 782 (1996). If he or she fails to meet this burden, then entry of summary judgment for the defendant based on qualified immunity occurs. <i>See </i><i>Saldana,</i> 684 F.2d at 1164.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Summary Judgment Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>11. \"[T]he pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits submitted in support [of] or in opposition to the motion [usually] constitute the summary judgment record.\" <i>Kelley v.

The Terrell Unit, a maximum security prison operated by the TDCJ's Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID),<sup>[11]</sup> Price Aff. ¶ 3; Price Aff. II ¶ 3, includes housing for inmates exhibiting the most violent tendencies, who are classified as \"close custody,\" Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. B (Affidavit of Alex Torres at 1 [hereinafter Torres Aff.])); <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. E (Videotaped Dep. of Joseph Keith Price at 67-68 [hereinafter Price Dep.])).</p>\n<p>14. Many of the events relevant to this case occurred on August 5, 1994, in the Terrell Unit's 7 Building, which, along with its 8 Building, quarters close custody prisoners, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 5, 6; <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 8. The 7 Building divides into three Pods (Pods A, B and C). Each Pod divides into three Sections (Sections A, B and C). Three levels of eight two-man cells (Rows 1, 2 and 3) are in each Section. A stairway connects the levels. A walkway runs around the shower area and in front of the cells on each level. On the ground floor of each Section is a dayroom, which serves as a commons area for the inmates. Price Aff. I ¶¶ 5-6; Price Aff. II ¶¶ 5-6; <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. A (Aff. of W. Ken Katsaris ¶ 2 [hereinafter Katsaris Aff.])).</p>\n<p>15. The three Sections in a Pod surround a two-story guard tower. The guard tower's second floor is a glass-enclosed control booth housing electronic controls for all cell doors in the Pod, for the doors connecting the Pod's Sections to each other and for the doors providing entry to and exit from the Pod. The control room also has a telephone and an intercom linked to intercoms located throughout the Pod. Mot. (Ex. 2 (Aff. of Essie Johnson ¶ 3 [hereinafter Johnson Aff. ])); <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 20-21; <i>see also</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 14. The Correctional Officer (CO) manning the control room can see nearly all areas of each Section. <i>See</i> Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2; Torres Aff. at 1-2. He or she may not leave his or her post except to use a bathroom located on the guard tower's first floor. Johnson Aff. ¶ 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stipulations</i></h2>\n<p>16. Stipulations entered in two lawsuits, <i>Ruiz v. Estelle</i><sup>[12]</sup> and <i>Lamar v. Coffield</i><i>,</i><sup>[13]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> govern certain aspects of the Terrell Unit's operations. They equate with consent decrees. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz v. McCotter,</i> 661 F.Supp. 112, 117 &amp; n. 7 (S.D.Tex.1986).</p>\n<p>17. The following portion of the <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation pertains to this litigation: \"During the hours the dayroom [in a cellblock] may be used, the doors from the dormitory to the dayroom shall remain unlocked and prisoners shall be permitted free access to and from the dayroom.\" <i>Ruiz v. Procunier,</i> Civil Action No. H-78-987-CA (S.D.Tex. 1985) [hereinafter <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation] (Stipulation Modifying Crowding Provisions of Am. Decree at 12); Price Aff. II ¶ 8 (reporting that the <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation dictated the Terrell Unit's policy on inmate access to dayroom areas). <i>See generally </i><i>McGill v. Duckworth,</i> 944 F.2d 344, 348 (7th Cir.1991) (recognizing that \"lock[ing prisoners] in their cells 24 hours a day . . . pos[es] constitutional problems of its own\" (parentheses omitted)), <i>cert. denied,</i> 503 U.S. 907, 112 S.Ct. 1265, 117 L.Ed.2d 493 (1992).</p>\n<p>18. The Stipulation in <i>Lamar</i> relates to this case insofar as it has prompted development of a cell assignment procedure at the Terrell Unit that seeks to \"fulfill the mission of achieving racial/ethnic balancing of inmates and the avoidance of racial segregation in close custody areas.\" Mot. (Ex. 5 (Aff. Denicia Jefferson at 1 [hereinafter Jefferson Aff.])). <i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 10-12 <i>with</i> Mot. (Ex. 6 [hereinafter Admin.R.] (administrative rule for assigning inmates to two-person cells)). Under this procedure, the Unit Classification Committee (UCC)<sup>[14]</sup> initially assigns a custody status to an incoming inmate (i.e., minimum-in, medium or close). <i>See</i> Mot. (Ex. 4 (Aff. of Salvador Buentello at 1, 2, 3 [hereinafter Buentello Aff.])); Jefferson Aff. at 1; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 11. At least on some occasions, it also decides whether to place him in 7 or 8 Building. <i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 10 <i>with</i> Jefferson Aff. at 1. When the UCC classifies a new prisoner as close custody, the Unit's Count Room<sup>[15]</sup> must ascertain whether or not the proportion of prisoners in the racial or ethnic group (African-American, Caucasian or Hispanic) of which he is a member in any of the Pods in the Building to which he has been assigned fails to mirror the proportion of the Terrell Unit's total close custody inmate population that the racial or ethnic group of which he is a member comprises. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 1-2; <i>cf.</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 10. If the new inmate's racial or ethnic group is under-represented in one of the Pods, then Count Room places him in it; otherwise, it puts him in Pod A. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Admin.R. The Count Room repeats this process to determine in which the Section of the Pod to house him. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Admin.R. If the new prisoner neither suffers from a physical infirmity nor has been restricted to sharing a cell only with a person of his race or ethnicity, then the Count Room puts him in the first available cell in the Section to which it assigns him.<sup>[16]</sup><i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 10-12; Admin.R.; Price Dep. at 38.</p>\n<p>19. During the time relevant to this case (i.e., the date on which the Terrell Unit opened through August 5, 1994), two geographic concerns affected cell assignment decisions at the Terrell Unit. First, all close custody prisoners from the same town or neighborhood, regardless of race, were housed together. <i>See</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. C (Operational Review Report at 5 [hereinafter Op.Rev.Rep.])). This geographic housing policy reflected a belief by Terrell Unit officials \"that inmates from the same areas would get along well together and [would] create fewer problems for the [prison] staff.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> Op.Rev.Rep. at 5. Second, close custody Hispanic inmates from South Texas and close custody Hispanic inmates from West Texas were placed in separate buildings. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-10. Terrell Unit's Senior Warden at the time, Keith Price, ordered implementation of this latter policy to reduce the risk of violence between these two groups, which are historic enemies. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-9; <i>see also</i> Price Dep. at 100-01. According to him, \"[e]ven if there had been no separation of west and south Texas Hispanic close custody inmates, both 7 and 8 buildings would have still housed essentially the same percentage of Hispanic inmates (approximately 50%) compared to the remainder of close custody inmates (Caucasians and African-Americans totaled approximately 50%).\"<sup>[17]</sup> Price Aff. I ¶ 10.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Events Prior to August 5, 1994</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Security Measures</i></h2>\n<p>20. The risk of inmate-on-inmate violence exists in prison. <i>See</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 13; <i>supra</i> ¶ 13; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 11 (recognizing that prisoners sometimes fight with each other). This threat sometimes manifests itself in a demand by some prisoners that another of their fellows pay them \"protection money\"<sup>[18]</sup> or fight them for the privilege of not having to do so. <i>See</i> Torres Aff. at 1.</p>\n<p>21. A number of measures were instituted at the Terrell Unit to reduce the risk of disorder among close custody inmates. First, an intercom system was installed in all Pods in 7 and 8 Buildings so that prisoners could communicate safety concerns to prison officials. <i>See</i> Johnson Aff. ¶¶ 3, 14; Price Aff. I ¶¶ 20-21; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 15. Second, to facilitate the preemption of situations heightening the possibility of inmate-on-inmate violence, a Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU), comprised of four full-time COs, gathered information from anonymous sources about inmate gang or group activities and reported their findings to the Senior Warden almost every day.<sup>[19]</sup> Price Aff. I ¶ 19; Price Dep. at 130. Third, close custody inmates subject to legitimate threats from fellow prisoners were entitled to placement in protective custody. Price Aff. I ¶ 20. Fourth, close custody inmates from South Texas and close custody inmates from West Texas were housed in different Buildings. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-9; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 20. Fifth, COs were told that young Caucasians in close custody cellblocks faced a higher risk of harm than other prisoners and were reminded daily to remain alert for activity indicating that close custody inmates, especially Caucasians in 7 Building, were facing demands for payment of \"protection money.\" Torres Aff. at 1, 2. Sixth, the design of the guard tower for each Pod enabled the direct monitoring of most prisoner activity. <i>See</i> Torres Aff. 1-2; Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 15. Finally, two COs, known as rovers, were assigned to work among the close custody inmate population in each Pod.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 25; Johnson Aff. ¶ 4; Price Aff. II ¶ 11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>CO Training</i></h2>\n<p>22. COs at the Terrell Unit began to work without supervision after they had received certification and training. Certification signified that a person had completed his or her CO training and was capable of performing any function of a CO at any TDCJ-ID facility. Price Aff. II ¶ 9; <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 23; Johnson Aff. ¶ 10. CO training occurred in two stages. First, a CO completed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> the TDCJ's two-week training academy, Price Aff. I ¶ 22; <i>see</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 9, where he or she learned about aspects of prison life, including the nature of close custody inmates, the risk of prisoners using steel-toed workboots as weapons,<sup>[21]</sup> the existence of prisoner gangs based on race and the possibility of those gangs seeking \"protection money\" from other inmates, Johnson Dep. at 49, 87-91. Second, he or she went through two weeks of on-the-job training at the Terrell Unit, Price Aff. I ¶ 22; Johnson Aff. ¶ 10, during which he or she was instructed to report suspicious inmate activity, <i>see</i> Torres Aff. at 1-2; Johnson Dep. at 132; <i>cf.</i> Johnson Dep. at 197 (reporting that COs attending the TDCJ's training academy were taught to be alert for suspicious prisoner activity). He or she also was told to take the following, progressive measures if he or she saw inmates congregating in an inappropriate manner while working in a guard tower control room: order the prisoners to disperse, direct a rover to the area if the prisoners refuse to move and seek help from the CO manning the Building's front desk if the rover is unable to assist.<sup>[22]</sup> Johnson Dep. at 149-50; <i>see</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 9; Torres Aff. at 1-2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>First Inmate Death</i></h2>\n<p>23. The Terrell Unit experienced its first inmate death for non-medical reasons in mid-July, 1994, when Paul Hernandez was discovered dead in Section A of 7 Building's B Pod. Price Aff. I ¶¶ 15, 17. Although the jail physician ruled at the time that Hernandez had choked to death on regurgitation, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 14, 16, a TDCJ Internal Affairs Division (TDCJ-IAD) report released several months later concluded that he was killed during a lovers' quarrel, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 14, 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>August 5, 1994</i></h2>\n<p>24. On August 5, 1994, Randy Payne, a twenty-three year old Caucasian, arrived at the Terrell Unit.<sup>[23]</sup> The UCC chose to preserve his close custody status,<sup>[24]</sup> Buentello Aff. at 1, 3; Price Aff. I ¶ 11; <i>see</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2, and assigned him to 7 Building, Jefferson Aff. at 1-2. The Count Room then identified Section B of Pod C as the area in 7 Building (Section B) in which to house him.<sup>[25]</sup><i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2.</p>\n<p>25. Shortly after his arrival in Section B later in the day, Randy Payne was confronted with a demand to pay \"protection money\" or to fight for the privilege of having not to do so. He chose to fight. The ensuing altercations occurred in various locations throughout Section B, including the third level shower area.<sup>[26]</sup> Katsaris Aff. at 3; McAuliffe Dep. at 37-38. All of the prisoners whom Randy Payne fought were either African-American or Hispanic. Torres Aff. at 2. Some of them used steel-toed boots as weapons. <i>See</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 7 (\"I am unaware of a single incident involving serious injury at the Terrell Unit, prior to August 5, 1994, involving close custody black or Hispanic inmates using steel-toed boots to assault a Caucasian or other inmates.\").</p>\n<p>26. On August 5, 1994, Essie Johnson, a CO who had worked at the Terrell Unit for only a brief time, <i>see</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 10 (two-and-a-half months); Katsaris Aff. at 5 (one month); Torres Aff. at 2 (\"new hire\"), was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> assigned to man the guard tower control room for 7 Building's C Pod (Pod C) during the prison's second shift, which ran from 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Johnson Aff. ¶ 3.<sup>[27]</sup> She was fully trained and certified to work as a CO.<sup>[28]</sup><i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 22 <i>with</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 10 <i>and</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 9.</p>\n<p>27. At approximately 8:30 p.m., Johnson saw an injured inmate, later identified as Randy Payne, on the stairs in Section B. She telephoned Alex Torres, the CO who was then working at 7 Building's front desk, for assistance.<sup>[29]</sup> Johnson Aff. ¶ 9; <i>see</i> Torres Aff. at 1. Torres entered Pod C. He determined that Randy Payne required immediate medical attention. Randy Payne, subsequently, was removed to the Terrell Unit's infirmary. Johnson Aff. ¶ 10; <i>see also</i> Torres Aff. at 1.</p>\n<p>28. Prior to 8:30 p.m., Johnson had noticed some inmates congregating around the third level showers in Section B,<sup>[30]</sup> Johnson Dep. at 133, 143-47, and had seen two prisoners looking into an area of the third level showers in Section B, Johnson Dep. at 168; <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. D (Supplemental Offense Report at 2 [hereinafter Supp.Off.Rep.])). Johnson also had permitted inmates to move between Sections freely.<sup>[31]</sup> Supp.Off.Rep. at 2-3.</p>\n<p>29. On August 12, 1994, Randy Payne died because of injuries sustained in the fights at the Terrell Unit a week earlier. <i>See</i> Pre-Trial Order at 3 (Stipulation and Uncontested Fact 3); <i>see also</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 15.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Operational Review Report</i></h2>\n<p>30. In October 1994, the TDCJ-ID assessed all aspects of the Terrell Unit after a number of inmates attacked some COs and a prisoner was found dead.<sup>[32]</sup> Op.Rev.Rep. at 1. The resulting Operational Review Report cited the geographic housing policy and the high concentration of relatively inexperienced COs working on the second shift, the peak period for activity in close custody cellblocks, as conditions weakening prison security.<sup>[33]</sup> Op.Rev.Rep. at 5, 9-10, 12-13.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Litigation</i></h2>\n<p>31. On November 17, 1994, the Paynes filed this Section 1983 action against Collins, Scott, Price and Johnson, in which they alleged that these four TDCJ officials had failed to protect Randy Payne from being assaulted by his fellow inmates in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Pls.' Original Compl. at 1-2.</p>\n<p>32. In a deposition taken as part of the discovery in this case, Price indicated that he generally knew about \"protection money,\" <i>see</i> Price Dep. at 118-19, disclosed that, as the Terrell Unit's \"chief administrative officer,\" he was \"ultimately in charge of the [prison] security program,\" Price Dep. at 19-20, and possessed the authority to impose experience and competence standards for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> COs working in close custody areas higher than those established by the TDCJ-ID, Price Dep. at 53-54, 82, 130.<sup>[34]</sup> He also conceded that he was ultimately responsible for decisions on where to house individual prisoners.<sup>[35]</sup> Price Dep. at 41-42. Finally, he reported that the \"free and frequent access\" policy increased the risk of inmate-on-inmate violence, Price Dep. at 96; <i>see also</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. G (Dep. of Arthur Pina at 121-22 [hereinafter Pina Dep.])), and that he had approved its discontinuance in 7 and 8 Buildings, <i>see</i> Price Dep. at 93-94; <i>see also</i> Pina Dep. at 121-22.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>EIGHTH AMENDMENT: FAILURE-TO-PROTECT</i></h2>\n<p>33. \"Prison officials have a [constitutional] duty.... to protect inmates from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\" <i>Horton v. Cockrell,</i> 70 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.1995); <i>accord </i><i>Johnston v. Lucas,</i> 786 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> F.2d 1254, 1259 (5th Cir.1986). To prove a violation of this obligation, the plaintiff must establish the following: \"he [or she] is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,\" <i>Neals v. Norwood,</i> 59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995), \"[the defendant] prison official[] [was] ... deliberately indifferent to his [or her] need for protection,\" <i>id.,</i> and causation, <i>LaMarca v. Turner,</i> 995 F.2d 1526, 1535 (11th Cir.1993), <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 1164, 114 S.Ct. 1189, 127 L.Ed.2d 539 (1994). \"[T]he Eighth Amendment defines the contours of the first two elements and section 1983 delimits the third.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>34. The first element of a claim alleging that a defendant prison official violated his or her duty to protect an inmate from violence at the hands of other inmates (failure-to-protect claim)the presence of conditions creating a substantial risk of serious harmis an objective standard. <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1977, 128 L.Ed.2d 811, 822-23 (1994); <i>see </i><i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> 503 U.S. 1, 8-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999-1000, 117 L.Ed.2d 156, 166-68 (1992). \"There is no concise definition of what types of prison conditions pose a `substantial risk of serious harm.'\" <i>Horton,</i> 70 F.3d at 401. <i>But cf. </i><i>Jensen v. Clarke,</i> 94 F.3d 1191, 1198 (8th Cir.1996) (\"Assault at the hands of fellow inmates ... is a `serious harm.'\"); <i>State Bank of St. Charles v. Camic,</i> 712 F.2d 1140, 1146 (7th Cir.) (deliberate indifference only arises where \"a strong likelihood, rather than a mere possibility,\" of serious harm exists), <i>cert. denied,</i> 464 U.S. 995, 104 S.Ct. 491, 78 L.Ed.2d 686 (1983); <i>El Tabech v. Gunter,</i> 922 F.Supp. 244, 257 (D.Neb.) (\"a `prison official's duty under the Eighth Amendment is to ensure \"reasonable safety,\"' not guarantee absolute safety\"), <i>aff'd sub nom. </i><i>Jensen v. Clarke,</i> 94 F.3d 1191 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<blockquote>Instead, [a court must] ... examine this component ... \"contextually,\" making sure to be responsive to \"contemporary standards of decency.\" [It, specifically,] ... must consider \"whether society considers the risk to be so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.\" [It] ... also must consider that the Eighth Amendment is intended to protect against both present and future dangers to inmates. Prison authorities must protect not only against current threats, but also against \"sufficiently imminent dangers\" that are likely to cause harm in the \"next week or month or year.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Horton,</i> 70 F.3d at 401. This approach contemplates not only reviewing the conditions creating a substantial danger to prisoners but also scrutinizing the actions taken by the defendant prison official to alleviate that threat. <i>See id. Compare Farmer</i> at 842-43, 114 S.Ct. at 1982-83, 128 L.Ed.2d at 829 (\"In addition, prison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.\") <i>with </i><i>Hare v. City of Corinth,</i> 74 F.3d 633, 649 n. 5 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc) (whether or not prison officials have responded reasonably to a substantial danger \"relate[s] necessarily to whether the first, or objective, component of an Eighth Amendment violation has been made out\").</p>\n<p>35. A failure-to-protect claim's second elementthat the defendant prison official exhibited deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of serious harmis a subjective standard. <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 838, 114 S.Ct. at 1980, 128 L.Ed.2d at 826; <i>Eason v. Thaler,</i> 73 F.3d 1322, 1329 (5th Cir.1996); <i>Harris v. Angelina County, Tex.,</i> 31 F.3d 331, 334 (5th Cir.1994); <i>see </i><i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 836, 114 S.Ct. at 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d at 825 (\"an official's failure to alleviate a significant risk he [or she] should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment\"); <i>id.</i> at 835, 114 S.Ct. at 1978, 128 L.Ed.2d at 824 (\"deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence\"). To prove this element, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant prison official knew of and disregarded the substantial risk of serious harm. <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 836, 114 S.Ct. at 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d at 825. <i>See generally </i><i>Hare,</i> 74 F.3d at 650 (deliberate indifference \"is a marriage of elements, not a listing of two elements independent of each other in application\"). He or she establishes the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> prison official's knowledge of the danger to inmate safety by showing that the defendant prison official was \"aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed], and [drew] the inference.\" <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 836, 114 S.Ct. at 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d at 825. He or she may prove this condition in \"many ways, including from circumstantial evidence. Indeed, the `[f]actfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk form [sic] the very fact that the risk was obvious.'\"<sup>[37]</sup><i>Horton,</i> 70 F.3d at 401; <i>see also </i><i>Pavlick v.

Prison officials charged with deliberate indifference might show, for example, that they did not know of the underlying facts indicating a sufficiently substantial danger and that they were therefore unaware of the danger, or that they knew of the underlying facts but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 842, 114 S.Ct. at 1982, 128 L.Ed.2d at 828; <i>see id.</i> at 836, 114 S.Ct. at 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d at 825 (\"the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exists, and he [or she] must also draw the inference\"). As to the other part of the deliberate indifference standardthe disregarding by the defendant prison official of the substantial risk of serious harm about which he or she knowsthe plaintiff must establish that the defendant prison official \"knew of ways to reduce the harm but knowingly declined to act, or.... knew of ways to reduce the harm but recklessly declined to act.\" <i>Hale v. Tallapoosa County,</i> 50 F.3d 1579, 1583 (11th Cir.1995); <i>see </i><i>Woods v. Lecureux,</i> 110 F.3d 1215, 1224-26 (6th Cir. 1997) (indicating that a defendant prison official exhibits deliberate indifference only when he or she deliberately disregards a substantial risk of serious harm); <i>Hare,</i> 74 F.3d at 649 n. 5 (\"where there is a recognition of a substantial danger and a response thereto, this second prong can be satisfied only in respect to the response itself\"); <i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1536 (\"if an official attempts to remedy a constitutionally deficient prison condition, but fails in that endeavor, he [or she] cannot be deliberately indifferent unless he [or she] knows of, but disregards, an appropriate and sufficient alternative\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> 36. Causation is the final element of a failure-to-protect claim. <i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1535, 1539. To prove it, the plaintiff must show the \"defendant [prison official's] participation in the alleged wrong.\" <i>Jacquez v.

The causation element manifests itself in two links. <i>Hale,</i> 50 F.3d at 1584; <i>see </i><i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1538-39. First, the plaintiff must demonstrate a connection \"between [the defendant prison official's] ... deliberately indifferent acts and omissions and the [substantial risk of serious harm].\" <i>Hale,</i> 50 F.3d at 1584.

The court overrules the objection to W. Ken Katsaris, whose affidavit appears as Plaintiff's Exhibit A to the Response, as unqualified to testify as an expert on maximum security prison facilities, especially those in Texas, because of a lack of personal familiarity with such matters, Reply at 3-4. Katsaris, who has acquired extensive training and education in prison operations, possesses sufficient expertise to testify about maximum security jails, including those in Texas; the objection relates to how much weight to give his expert testimony.<sup>[43]</sup><i>See </i><i>Compton v.

Having ruled on the admissibility of the evidence presented in support of and opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, the court now considers the motion's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> merits as to each defendant. <i>See </i><i>Christophersen,</i> 939 F.2d at 1109-1110.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Collins and Scott</i></h2>\n<p>62. Collins and Scott contend that they must receive summary judgment because the Paynes present nothing beyond their second amended complaint to support their Eighth Amendment claims against either of them. <i>See</i> Mot. at 5-6.</p>\n<p>63. The Paynes offer no evidence to counter the properly supported summary judgment motion of Collins and Scott.<sup>[48]</sup><i>See</i> Resp. at 1 n. 1. Consequently, their Eight Amendment claims against these two defendants fail. <i>See </i><i>International Shortstop,</i> 939 F.2d at 1264, 1266; <i>Lavespere,</i> 910 F.2d at 178.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Price</i></h2>\n<p>64. Price maintains that the uncontroverted facts \"demonstrate[] that [he was] ... not deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to [Randy] Payne,\" Mot. at 2; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 6-8, and denies his personal involvement in creating any conditions at the Terrell Unit that, according to the Paynes, precipitated the violence on August 5, 1994, <i>see</i> Mot. at 4-5; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 4. The Paynes respond with the following series of propositions: the geographic housing and \"free and frequent access\" policies, the issuance of steel-toed boots, a lack of COs possessing sufficient experience and competence in 7 and 8 Buildings and the presence of African-American and Hispanic gangs in close custody areas created a substantial risk of serious harm to close custody Caucasian inmates at the Terrell Unit,<sup>[49]</sup> Resp. at 3-6; this threat was so obvious that Price must have known about it, <i>see</i> Resp. at 3, 4-6; Price disregarded the obvious risk to close custody Caucasian inmates by failing to take measures to reduce the substantial risk of serious harm beyond monitoring inmate gang and group activity through the GIU, <i>see</i> Resp. at 5, 8; the paucity of action by Price permitted the substantial risk of serious harm to Caucasian close custody inmates to persist, <i>see</i> Resp. at 8-10, and; the conditions creating the danger to close custody Caucasian inmates triggered the fights involving Randy Payne, <i>see</i> Resp. at 8-10. They point to the following as proving Price's personal responsibility for the problems that climaxed with violence in Section B on August 5, 1994: Price's role as \"chief administrative officer of the [Terrell Unit, who] was ultimately in charge of the security program that provided for the safety of the prisoners;\" Price's approval of the \"free and frequent access\" policy;<sup>[50]</sup> Price's permitting the issuance of steel-toed boots to close custody inmates; Price's ability to \"control where an inmate was housed;\" Price's establishment of the geographic housing policy,<sup>[51]</sup> and; Price's authority \"to implement a policy requiring more experienced and competent guards for the close custody section.\"<sup>[52]</sup> Resp. at 8-10 &amp; n. 4; <i>see also</i> Resp. at 5-6.</p>\n<p>65. The evidence to which the Paynes point as creating a genuine issue on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1060</span> Price's individual responsibility for the circumstances that they identify as leading to the fights involving Randy Payne is insufficient to create a necessity for trial. First, Price's admission of ultimate responsibility for the Terrell Unit's security, <i>supra</i> ¶ 32, can demonstrate nothing more than fault based on the theory of respondeat superior, an insufficient basis for constitutional liability. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Woods,</i> 51 F.3d at 583.</p>\n<p>66. Second, the evidence offers no support for the Paynes' contentions regarding Price's role in the enactment of the \"free and frequent access\" and steel-toed workboots policies. Authorities other than Price enacted these measures. <i>See supra</i> ¶ 17 and note 21. Therefore, no causal connection between Price and the two policies exists. <i>See </i><i>Hale,</i> 50 F.3d at 1583-84; <i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1539; <i>cf. </i><i>Coleman,</i> 113 F.3d at 534.</p>\n<p>67. Third, Price's concession that he was ultimately responsible for inmate housing decisions, <i>see supra</i> note 35, establishes nothing more than fault based on respondeat superior, an insufficient basis for constitutional liability.<sup>[53]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Woods,</i> 51 F.3d at 583.</p>\n<p>68. Fourth, although Price apparently approved the geographic housing policy, <i>see supra</i> ¶ 19, he never appreciated its deleterious effect on prison security,<sup>[54]</sup><i>see supra</i> ¶ 19 and note 20. His attitude reflected that of a prison official who \"knew the underlying facts [engendering a substantial, even obvious, risk of harm] but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.\"<sup>[55]</sup><i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 842, 114 S.Ct. at 1982, 128 L.Ed.2d at 828.</p>\n<p>69. Finally, Price's decision to forgo imposing experience and competency requirements for COs working in close custody areas higher than those established by the TDCJ-ID,<sup>[56]</sup><i>see supra</i> ¶ 32 and note 34, by itself, was not a deliberate disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates, assuming that such a threat existed.<sup>[57]</sup> Comparison of this particular inaction with omissions occurring in suits involving claims similar to the one made here shows that it fails to reflect the kind of official nonfeasance constituting an Eighth Amendment violation. <i>Compare </i><i>Smith v. Arkansas Dep't of Correction,</i> 103 F.3d 637, 640-42, 645 (8th Cir.1996) (finding a deliberate disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm) <i>and </i><i>Hale,</i> 50 F.3d at 1580-81, 1583 (same) <i>and </i><i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1532-33, 1537-38 (same) <i>with </i><i>Woods,</i> 110 F.3d at 1218, 1224-26 (warden's actions fail to evince a deliberate disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm) <i>and </i><i>Street v. Corrections Corp. of Am.,</i> 102 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir.1996) (maintenance of prison staffing levels consistent with Tennessee Corrections Institute and the American Corrections Association provides \"ample evidence\" of a sufficient response by prison warden to staffing concern).</p>\n<p>70. The Paynes' evidence falls short of creating a genuine issue of material fact. In other words, rather than \"present[ing] ... <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury,\" the evidence regarding their failure-to-protect claim \"is so one-sided that [Price] ... must prevail as a matter of law.\" <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 214 (1986). Their Eighth Amendment claim against Price, consequently, proves unable to survive his summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Johnson</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Attacks on the Merits of the Paynes' Claims</i></h2>\n<p>71. Johnson presents three arguments for why she should receive summary judgment on the merits. The first two prove unavailing, while the third one succeeds.</p>\n<p>72. Johnson initially claims that the uncontroverted facts portray her as ignorant of the inmate violence on August 5, 1994, before she saw Randy Payne on the Section B stairs at approximately 8:30 p.m. Mot. 9, 11; Reply at 4-5. In response to this assertion, the Paynes contend the evidence raises a reasonable inference that Johnson witnessed the violence in Section B and took no action until it ended. <i>See</i> Resp. at 6.</p>\n<p>73. Johnson's first argument lacks merit. Contrary to what she says, the record includes enough evidence to raise a genuine issue about whether or not she saw the fights involving Randy Payne and failed to respond until they concluded. Specifically, Torres states that, based on his personal knowledge, a CO in the control room of Pod C's guard tower properly performing his or her job would have seen the violence, Torres Aff. at 1, 2, while Katsaris provides testimony suggesting that no fighting could have been concealed from the view of the Pod C control room, Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2. <i>See </i><i>Wright v. Jones,</i> 907 F.2d 848, 850 (8th Cir.1990) (whether prison guards witnessed a fight between inmates \"was a question for the jury, since there was abundant evidence, including an investigative report prepared by prison officials, indicating that at least one fight took place between 4:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. in a hall that was plainly visible from the rotunda where the guards were stationed\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Fickes v. Jefferson County,</i> 900 F.Supp. 84, 89 (E.D.Tex.1995) (\"[Defendant] claims that the fight [between the prisoners] did not erupt until after he had made his rounds. This sort of credibility determination is not appropriately resolved on a motion for summary judgment.\").</p>\n<p>74. Johnson also maintains that, \"[e]ven if [she] ... had seen the assaults, Randy Payne did not have a constitutional right to have [her] ... risk her personal safety or the violation of TDCJ rules regulating the conduct of picket control officers in order to try to personally protect Payne from an assault.\" Mot. at 11; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 9. This argument is unavailing because it rests on an incomplete understanding of her constitutional duty. Regardless of whether the Eighth Amendment imposes an obligation on a prison official to intervene directly in an inmate fight when doing so either would place him or her in danger of physical harm,<sup>[58]</sup> or would require the abandonment of his or her station in violation of prison regulations, it demands that he or she take <i>some</i> action to halt the violence. <i>See </i><i>Davidson v. Cannon,</i> 474 U.S. 344, 348, 106 S.Ct. 668, 670-71, 88 L.Ed.2d 677, 683 (1986) (\"Petitioner's claim, based on respondents' negligence, is quite different from one involving injuries caused ... by another prisoner where officials simply stood by and permitted the attack to proceed.\");<sup>[59]</sup><i>Billman v. Indiana Dep't of Corrections,</i> 56 F.3d 785, 790 (7th Cir.1995) (\"Of course to be liable under the standard of [deliberate indifference] ... the guards would have to be more than negligentwould, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1062</span> for examplehave had to watch the rape in progress yet have done nothing to stop it though in a position to do so.\"); <i>Williams v. Mueller,</i> 13 F.3d 1214, 1216 (8th Cir.1994) (\"A prison official acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate's safety when the official is present at the time of an assault and fails to intervene or otherwise act to end the assault.\"); <i>see also Willis v. Estrada,</i> No. 91 C 6288, 1995 WL 398873, at *2 (N.D.Ill. July 2, 1995); <i>Holloway v. Wittry,</i> 842 F.Supp. 1193, 1195-96, 1199-1200 (S.D.Iowa 1994).</p>\n<p>75. Finally, Johnson claims that \"was never in possession of any information that [Randy Payne] ... was being assaulted.\" Mot. at 12; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 9; Johnson Aff. ¶ 7 (\"Prior to my seeking inmate Payne walking down the stairs ... at approximately 8:30 p.m., I had not seen inmate Payne being assaulted or struck by any inmate at any time, nor did I have any idea that Payne was being or had been assaulted by any inmate at any time.\"). In response to this contention, the Paynes essentially assert that Johnson broke a prison rule requiring COs to investigate or report suspicious prisoner activity when she failed to take any action in response to the group of inmates gathered near Section B's third level showers<sup>[60]</sup> and when she failed to take any action in response to two inmates peering into Section B's third level showers during the time when Randy Payne was fighting. <i>Compare</i> Resp. at 6 <i>with supra</i> ¶ 28.

Most of the duty posts inside a prison require a lot of responsibility, so whether an employee's been responsible or not so responsible in the past, we're still going to put them in one of those key posts.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Q: And whoever assigned the guards to transport that person [with close custody status] put a guard with one day experience, or two guardboth guards to transport him had one day of experience, you, as warden of the prison, couldn't have stepped in and said, \"No, I want these guys with five years of experience who have seen this before, I want them to do transportation.\"?</p>\n<p>A: I disagree with the theory of what you said, now</p>\n<p>Q: I'm just asking whether you as warden </p>\n<p>A: I could have done that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q: You, as warden, could have done that?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>Q: You didn't take any active steps to eliminate [demands for \"protection money\"] ..., for example, you didn't assign more experienced guards to close custody areas, correct?</p>\n<p>A: I didn't change the procedures that were that were in place, no.</p>\n<p>Price Dep. at 53-54, 82, 130.</p>\n<p>[35]  In the following exchange, Price explained his responsibility as to cell assignment decisions:\n</p>\n<p>Q: So you're saying, as warden, you could go for three hundred and sixty-five days in a row and not make a single autonomous decision and your prison run like a top?</p>\n<p>A: Well, I don't know if it'd run like a top or not, but there'sthere's not a lot of particularly large areas thatthat you have the autonomy to make decisions in, no, I mean</p>\n<p>Q: you're saying virtually every single decision is made for you?</p>\n<p>A: As far as major program impact, most of those are done.

First, it gives no indication of exactly when Price authorized the modification of the \"free and frequent access\" policy. <i>See</i> Price Dep. at 93-94; Pina Dep. at 121-22. Second, it fails to explain how Price's termination of the \"free and frequent access\" policy squared with the need for a party to secure judicial approval before departing from the terms of the <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation relevant to this case, <i>see supra</i> note 12.</p>\n<p>[37]  This situation arises only \"[u]nder exceptional circumstances.\" <i>Reeves v.

The Terrell Unit, a maximum security prison operated by the TDCJ's Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID),<sup>[11]</sup> Price Aff. ¶ 3; Price Aff. II ¶ 3, includes housing for inmates exhibiting the most violent tendencies, who are classified as \"close custody,\" Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. B (Affidavit of Alex Torres at 1 [hereinafter Torres Aff.])); <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. E (Videotaped Dep. of Joseph Keith Price at 67-68 [hereinafter Price Dep.])).</p>\n<p>14. Many of the events relevant to this case occurred on August 5, 1994, in the Terrell Unit's 7 Building, which, along with its 8 Building, quarters close custody prisoners, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 5, 6; <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 8. The 7 Building divides into three Pods (Pods A, B and C). Each Pod divides into three Sections (Sections A, B and C). Three levels of eight two-man cells (Rows 1, 2 and 3) are in each Section. A stairway connects the levels. A walkway runs around the shower area and in front of the cells on each level. On the ground floor of each Section is a dayroom, which serves as a commons area for the inmates. Price Aff. I ¶¶ 5-6; Price Aff. II ¶¶ 5-6; <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. A (Aff. of W. Ken Katsaris ¶ 2 [hereinafter Katsaris Aff.])).</p>\n<p>15. The three Sections in a Pod surround a two-story guard tower. The guard tower's second floor is a glass-enclosed control booth housing electronic controls for all cell doors in the Pod, for the doors connecting the Pod's Sections to each other and for the doors providing entry to and exit from the Pod. The control room also has a telephone and an intercom linked to intercoms located throughout the Pod. Mot. (Ex. 2 (Aff. of Essie Johnson ¶ 3 [hereinafter Johnson Aff. ])); <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 20-21; <i>see also</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 14. The Correctional Officer (CO) manning the control room can see nearly all areas of each Section. <i>See</i> Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2; Torres Aff. at 1-2. He or she may not leave his or her post except to use a bathroom located on the guard tower's first floor. Johnson Aff. ¶ 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stipulations</i></h2>\n<p>16. Stipulations entered in two lawsuits, <i>Ruiz v. Estelle</i><sup>[12]</sup> and <i>Lamar v. Coffield</i><i>,</i><sup>[13]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> govern certain aspects of the Terrell Unit's operations. They equate with consent decrees. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz v.

The following portion of the <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation pertains to this litigation: \"During the hours the dayroom [in a cellblock] may be used, the doors from the dormitory to the dayroom shall remain unlocked and prisoners shall be permitted free access to and from the dayroom.\" <i>Ruiz v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></span> (1992).</p>\n<p>18. The Stipulation in <i>Lamar</i> relates to this case insofar as it has prompted development of a cell assignment procedure at the Terrell Unit that seeks to \"fulfill the mission of achieving racial/ethnic balancing of inmates and the avoidance of racial segregation in close custody areas.\" Mot. (Ex. 5 (Aff. Denicia Jefferson at 1 [hereinafter Jefferson Aff.])). <i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 10-12 <i>with</i> Mot. (Ex. 6 [hereinafter Admin.R.] (administrative rule for assigning inmates to two-person cells)). Under this procedure, the Unit Classification Committee (UCC)<sup>[14]</sup> initially assigns a custody status to an incoming inmate (i.e., minimum-in, medium or close). <i>See</i> Mot. (Ex. 4 (Aff. of Salvador Buentello at 1, 2, 3 [hereinafter Buentello Aff.])); Jefferson Aff. at 1; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 11. At least on some occasions, it also decides whether to place him in 7 or 8 Building. <i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 10 <i>with</i> Jefferson Aff. at 1. When the UCC classifies a new prisoner as close custody, the Unit's Count Room<sup>[15]</sup> must ascertain whether or not the proportion of prisoners in the racial or ethnic group (African-American, Caucasian or Hispanic) of which he is a member in any of the Pods in the Building to which he has been assigned fails to mirror the proportion of the Terrell Unit's total close custody inmate population that the racial or ethnic group of which he is a member comprises. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 1-2; <i>cf.</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 10. If the new inmate's racial or ethnic group is under-represented in one of the Pods, then Count Room places him in it; otherwise, it puts him in Pod A. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Admin.R. The Count Room repeats this process to determine in which the Section of the Pod to house him. <i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Admin.R. If the new prisoner neither suffers from a physical infirmity nor has been restricted to sharing a cell only with a person of his race or ethnicity, then the Count Room puts him in the first available cell in the Section to which it assigns him.<sup>[16]</sup><i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 10-12; Admin.R.; Price Dep. at 38.</p>\n<p>19. During the time relevant to this case (i.e., the date on which the Terrell Unit opened through August 5, 1994), two geographic concerns affected cell assignment decisions at the Terrell Unit. First, all close custody prisoners from the same town or neighborhood, regardless of race, were housed together. <i>See</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. C (Operational Review Report at 5 [hereinafter Op.Rev.Rep.])). This geographic housing policy reflected a belief by Terrell Unit officials \"that inmates from the same areas would get along well together and [would] create fewer problems for the [prison] staff.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> Op.Rev.Rep. at 5. Second, close custody Hispanic inmates from South Texas and close custody Hispanic inmates from West Texas were placed in separate buildings. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-10. Terrell Unit's Senior Warden at the time, Keith Price, ordered implementation of this latter policy to reduce the risk of violence between these two groups, which are historic enemies. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-9; <i>see also</i> Price Dep. at 100-01. According to him, \"[e]ven if there had been no separation of west and south Texas Hispanic close custody inmates, both 7 and 8 buildings would have still housed essentially the same percentage of Hispanic inmates (approximately 50%) compared to the remainder of close custody inmates (Caucasians and African-Americans totaled approximately 50%).\"<sup>[17]</sup> Price Aff. I ¶ 10.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Events Prior to August 5, 1994</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Security Measures</i></h2>\n<p>20. The risk of inmate-on-inmate violence exists in prison. <i>See</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 13; <i>supra</i> ¶ 13; <i>see also</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 11 (recognizing that prisoners sometimes fight with each other). This threat sometimes manifests itself in a demand by some prisoners that another of their fellows pay them \"protection money\"<sup>[18]</sup> or fight them for the privilege of not having to do so. <i>See</i> Torres Aff. at 1.</p>\n<p>21. A number of measures were instituted at the Terrell Unit to reduce the risk of disorder among close custody inmates. First, an intercom system was installed in all Pods in 7 and 8 Buildings so that prisoners could communicate safety concerns to prison officials. <i>See</i> Johnson Aff. ¶¶ 3, 14; Price Aff. I ¶¶ 20-21; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 15. Second, to facilitate the preemption of situations heightening the possibility of inmate-on-inmate violence, a Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU), comprised of four full-time COs, gathered information from anonymous sources about inmate gang or group activities and reported their findings to the Senior Warden almost every day.<sup>[19]</sup> Price Aff. I ¶ 19; Price Dep. at 130. Third, close custody inmates subject to legitimate threats from fellow prisoners were entitled to placement in protective custody. Price Aff. I ¶ 20. Fourth, close custody inmates from South Texas and close custody inmates from West Texas were housed in different Buildings. <i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶¶ 8-9; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 20. Fifth, COs were told that young Caucasians in close custody cellblocks faced a higher risk of harm than other prisoners and were reminded daily to remain alert for activity indicating that close custody inmates, especially Caucasians in 7 Building, were facing demands for payment of \"protection money.\" Torres Aff. at 1, 2. Sixth, the design of the guard tower for each Pod enabled the direct monitoring of most prisoner activity. <i>See</i> Torres Aff. 1-2; Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2; <i>see also supra</i> ¶ 15. Finally, two COs, known as rovers, were assigned to work among the close custody inmate population in each Pod.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 25; Johnson Aff. ¶ 4; Price Aff. II ¶ 11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>CO Training</i></h2>\n<p>22. COs at the Terrell Unit began to work without supervision after they had received certification and training. Certification signified that a person had completed his or her CO training and was capable of performing any function of a CO at any TDCJ-ID facility. Price Aff. II ¶ 9; <i>see</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 23; Johnson Aff. ¶ 10. CO training occurred in two stages. First, a CO completed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> the TDCJ's two-week training academy, Price Aff. I ¶ 22; <i>see</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 9, where he or she learned about aspects of prison life, including the nature of close custody inmates, the risk of prisoners using steel-toed workboots as weapons,<sup>[21]</sup> the existence of prisoner gangs based on race and the possibility of those gangs seeking \"protection money\" from other inmates, Johnson Dep. at 49, 87-91. Second, he or she went through two weeks of on-the-job training at the Terrell Unit, Price Aff. I ¶ 22; Johnson Aff. ¶ 10, during which he or she was instructed to report suspicious inmate activity, <i>see</i> Torres Aff. at 1-2; Johnson Dep. at 132; <i>cf.</i> Johnson Dep. at 197 (reporting that COs attending the TDCJ's training academy were taught to be alert for suspicious prisoner activity). He or she also was told to take the following, progressive measures if he or she saw inmates congregating in an inappropriate manner while working in a guard tower control room: order the prisoners to disperse, direct a rover to the area if the prisoners refuse to move and seek help from the CO manning the Building's front desk if the rover is unable to assist.<sup>[22]</sup> Johnson Dep. at 149-50; <i>see</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 9; Torres Aff. at 1-2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>First Inmate Death</i></h2>\n<p>23. The Terrell Unit experienced its first inmate death for non-medical reasons in mid-July, 1994, when Paul Hernandez was discovered dead in Section A of 7 Building's B Pod. Price Aff. I ¶¶ 15, 17. Although the jail physician ruled at the time that Hernandez had choked to death on regurgitation, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 14, 16, a TDCJ Internal Affairs Division (TDCJ-IAD) report released several months later concluded that he was killed during a lovers' quarrel, Price Aff. I ¶¶ 14, 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>August 5, 1994</i></h2>\n<p>24. On August 5, 1994, Randy Payne, a twenty-three year old Caucasian, arrived at the Terrell Unit.<sup>[23]</sup> The UCC chose to preserve his close custody status,<sup>[24]</sup> Buentello Aff. at 1, 3; Price Aff. I ¶ 11; <i>see</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2, and assigned him to 7 Building, Jefferson Aff. at 1-2. The Count Room then identified Section B of Pod C as the area in 7 Building (Section B) in which to house him.<sup>[25]</sup><i>See</i> Jefferson Aff. at 2.</p>\n<p>25. Shortly after his arrival in Section B later in the day, Randy Payne was confronted with a demand to pay \"protection money\" or to fight for the privilege of having not to do so. He chose to fight. The ensuing altercations occurred in various locations throughout Section B, including the third level shower area.<sup>[26]</sup> Katsaris Aff. at 3; McAuliffe Dep. at 37-38. All of the prisoners whom Randy Payne fought were either African-American or Hispanic. Torres Aff. at 2. Some of them used steel-toed boots as weapons. <i>See</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 7 (\"I am unaware of a single incident involving serious injury at the Terrell Unit, prior to August 5, 1994, involving close custody black or Hispanic inmates using steel-toed boots to assault a Caucasian or other inmates.\").</p>\n<p>26. On August 5, 1994, Essie Johnson, a CO who had worked at the Terrell Unit for only a brief time, <i>see</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 10 (two-and-a-half months); Katsaris Aff. at 5 (one month); Torres Aff. at 2 (\"new hire\"), was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> assigned to man the guard tower control room for 7 Building's C Pod (Pod C) during the prison's second shift, which ran from 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Johnson Aff. ¶ 3.<sup>[27]</sup> She was fully trained and certified to work as a CO.<sup>[28]</sup><i>Compare</i> Price Aff. I ¶ 22 <i>with</i> Johnson Aff. ¶ 10 <i>and</i> Price Aff. II ¶ 9.</p>\n<p>27. At approximately 8:30 p.m., Johnson saw an injured inmate, later identified as Randy Payne, on the stairs in Section B. She telephoned Alex Torres, the CO who was then working at 7 Building's front desk, for assistance.<sup>[29]</sup> Johnson Aff. ¶ 9; <i>see</i> Torres Aff. at 1. Torres entered Pod C. He determined that Randy Payne required immediate medical attention. Randy Payne, subsequently, was removed to the Terrell Unit's infirmary. Johnson Aff. ¶ 10; <i>see also</i> Torres Aff. at 1.</p>\n<p>28. Prior to 8:30 p.m., Johnson had noticed some inmates congregating around the third level showers in Section B,<sup>[30]</sup> Johnson Dep. at 133, 143-47, and had seen two prisoners looking into an area of the third level showers in Section B, Johnson Dep. at 168; <i>see</i> Resp. (Pl.'s Ex. D (Supplemental Offense Report at 2 [hereinafter Supp.Off.Rep.])). Johnson also had permitted inmates to move between Sections freely.<sup>[31]</sup> Supp.Off.Rep. at 2-3.</p>\n<p>29.

In October 1994, the TDCJ-ID assessed all aspects of the Terrell Unit after a number of inmates attacked some COs and a prisoner was found dead.<sup>[32]</sup> Op.Rev.Rep. at 1. The resulting Operational Review Report cited the geographic housing policy and the high concentration of relatively inexperienced COs working on the second shift, the peak period for activity in close custody cellblocks, as conditions weakening prison security.<sup>[33]</sup> Op.Rev.Rep. at 5, 9-10, 12-13.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Litigation</i></h2>\n<p>31. On November 17, 1994, the Paynes filed this Section 1983 action against Collins, Scott, Price and Johnson, in which they alleged that these four TDCJ officials had failed to protect Randy Payne from being assaulted by his fellow inmates in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

Having ruled on the admissibility of the evidence presented in support of and opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, the court now considers the motion's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> merits as to each defendant. <i>See </i><i>Christophersen,</i> 939 F.2d at 1109-1110.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Collins and Scott</i></h2>\n<p>62. Collins and Scott contend that they must receive summary judgment because the Paynes present nothing beyond their second amended complaint to support their Eighth Amendment claims against either of them. <i>See</i> Mot. at 5-6.</p>\n<p>63. The Paynes offer no evidence to counter the properly supported summary judgment motion of Collins and Scott.<sup>[48]</sup><i>See</i> Resp. at 1 n. 1. Consequently, their Eight Amendment claims against these two defendants fail. <i>See </i><i>International Shortstop,</i> 939 F.2d at 1264, 1266; <i>Lavespere,</i> 910 F.2d at 178.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Price</i></h2>\n<p>64. Price maintains that the uncontroverted facts \"demonstrate[] that [he was] ... not deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to [Randy] Payne,\" Mot. at 2; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 6-8, and denies his personal involvement in creating any conditions at the Terrell Unit that, according to the Paynes, precipitated the violence on August 5, 1994, <i>see</i> Mot. at 4-5; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 4. The Paynes respond with the following series of propositions: the geographic housing and \"free and frequent access\" policies, the issuance of steel-toed boots, a lack of COs possessing sufficient experience and competence in 7 and 8 Buildings and the presence of African-American and Hispanic gangs in close custody areas created a substantial risk of serious harm to close custody Caucasian inmates at the Terrell Unit,<sup>[49]</sup> Resp. at 3-6; this threat was so obvious that Price must have known about it, <i>see</i> Resp. at 3, 4-6; Price disregarded the obvious risk to close custody Caucasian inmates by failing to take measures to reduce the substantial risk of serious harm beyond monitoring inmate gang and group activity through the GIU, <i>see</i> Resp. at 5, 8; the paucity of action by Price permitted the substantial risk of serious harm to Caucasian close custody inmates to persist, <i>see</i> Resp. at 8-10, and; the conditions creating the danger to close custody Caucasian inmates triggered the fights involving Randy Payne, <i>see</i> Resp. at 8-10. They point to the following as proving Price's personal responsibility for the problems that climaxed with violence in Section B on August 5, 1994: Price's role as \"chief administrative officer of the [Terrell Unit, who] was ultimately in charge of the security program that provided for the safety of the prisoners;\" Price's approval of the \"free and frequent access\" policy;<sup>[50]</sup> Price's permitting the issuance of steel-toed boots to close custody inmates; Price's ability to \"control where an inmate was housed;\" Price's establishment of the geographic housing policy,<sup>[51]</sup> and; Price's authority \"to implement a policy requiring more experienced and competent guards for the close custody section.\"<sup>[52]</sup> Resp. at 8-10 &amp; n. 4; <i>see also</i> Resp. at 5-6.</p>\n<p>65. The evidence to which the Paynes point as creating a genuine issue on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1060</span> Price's individual responsibility for the circumstances that they identify as leading to the fights involving Randy Payne is insufficient to create a necessity for trial. First, Price's admission of ultimate responsibility for the Terrell Unit's security, <i>supra</i> ¶ 32, can demonstrate nothing more than fault based on the theory of respondeat superior, an insufficient basis for constitutional liability. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Woods,</i> 51 F.3d at 583.</p>\n<p>66. Second, the evidence offers no support for the Paynes' contentions regarding Price's role in the enactment of the \"free and frequent access\" and steel-toed workboots policies. Authorities other than Price enacted these measures. <i>See supra</i> ¶ 17 and note 21. Therefore, no causal connection between Price and the two policies exists. <i>See </i><i>Hale,</i> 50 F.3d at 1583-84; <i>LaMarca,</i> 995 F.2d at 1539; <i>cf. </i><i>Coleman,</i> 113 F.3d at 534.</p>\n<p>67. Third, Price's concession that he was ultimately responsible for inmate housing decisions, <i>see supra</i> note 35, establishes nothing more than fault based on respondeat superior, an insufficient basis for constitutional liability.<sup>[53]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Woods,</i> 51 F.3d at 583.</p>\n<p>68. Fourth, although Price apparently approved the geographic housing policy, <i>see supra</i> ¶ 19, he never appreciated its deleterious effect on prison security,<sup>[54]</sup><i>see supra</i> ¶ 19 and note 20. His attitude reflected that of a prison official who \"knew the underlying facts [engendering a substantial, even obvious, risk of harm] but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.\"<sup>[55]</sup><i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 842, 114 S.Ct. at 1982, 128 L.Ed.2d at 828.</p>\n<p>69. Finally, Price's decision to forgo imposing experience and competency requirements for COs working in close custody areas higher than those established by the TDCJ-ID,<sup>[56]</sup><i>see supra</i> ¶ 32 and note 34, by itself, was not a deliberate disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates, assuming that such a threat existed.<sup>[57]</sup> Comparison of this particular inaction with omissions occurring in suits involving claims similar to the one made here shows that it fails to reflect the kind of official nonfeasance constituting an Eighth Amendment violation. <i>Compare </i><i>Smith v.

The Paynes' evidence falls short of creating a genuine issue of material fact. In other words, rather than \"present[ing] ... <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1061</span> sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury,\" the evidence regarding their failure-to-protect claim \"is so one-sided that [Price] ... must prevail as a matter of law.\" <i>Anderson v.

Their Eighth Amendment claim against Price, consequently, proves unable to survive his summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Johnson</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Attacks on the Merits of the Paynes' Claims</i></h2>\n<p>71. Johnson presents three arguments for why she should receive summary judgment on the merits. The first two prove unavailing, while the third one succeeds.</p>\n<p>72. Johnson initially claims that the uncontroverted facts portray her as ignorant of the inmate violence on August 5, 1994, before she saw Randy Payne on the Section B stairs at approximately 8:30 p.m. Mot. 9, 11; Reply at 4-5. In response to this assertion, the Paynes contend the evidence raises a reasonable inference that Johnson witnessed the violence in Section B and took no action until it ended. <i>See</i> Resp. at 6.</p>\n<p>73. Johnson's first argument lacks merit. Contrary to what she says, the record includes enough evidence to raise a genuine issue about whether or not she saw the fights involving Randy Payne and failed to respond until they concluded. Specifically, Torres states that, based on his personal knowledge, a CO in the control room of Pod C's guard tower properly performing his or her job would have seen the violence, Torres Aff. at 1, 2, while Katsaris provides testimony suggesting that no fighting could have been concealed from the view of the Pod C control room, Katsaris Aff. ¶ 2. <i>See </i><i>Wright v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544323\"><a href=\"/opinion/544323/richard-evan-wright-and-gregory-charles-wright-v-jim-jones-tony-gammon/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 850 (8th Cir.1990) (whether prison guards witnessed a fight between inmates \"was a question for the jury, since there was abundant evidence, including an investigative report prepared by prison officials, indicating that at least one fight took place between 4:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. in a hall that was plainly visible from the rotunda where the guards were stationed\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Fickes v. Jefferson County,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This sort of credibility determination is not appropriately resolved on a motion for summary judgment.\").</p>\n<p>74. Johnson also maintains that, \"[e]ven if [she] ... had seen the assaults, Randy Payne did not have a constitutional right to have [her] ... risk her personal safety or the violation of TDCJ rules regulating the conduct of picket control officers in order to try to personally protect Payne from an assault.\" Mot. at 11; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 9. This argument is unavailing because it rests on an incomplete understanding of her constitutional duty. Regardless of whether the Eighth Amendment imposes an obligation on a prison official to intervene directly in an inmate fight when doing so either would place him or her in danger of physical harm,<sup>[58]</sup> or would require the abandonment of his or her station in violation of prison regulations, it demands that he or she take <i>some</i> action to halt the violence. <i>See </i><i>Davidson v.

Finally, Johnson claims that \"was never in possession of any information that [Randy Payne] ... was being assaulted.\" Mot. at 12; <i>see also</i> Mot. at 9; Johnson Aff. ¶ 7 (\"Prior to my seeking inmate Payne walking down the stairs ... at approximately 8:30 p.m., I had not seen inmate Payne being assaulted or struck by any inmate at any time, nor did I have any idea that Payne was being or had been assaulted by any inmate at any time.\"). In response to this contention, the Paynes essentially assert that Johnson broke a prison rule requiring COs to investigate or report suspicious prisoner activity when she failed to take any action in response to the group of inmates gathered near Section B's third level showers<sup>[60]</sup> and when she failed to take any action in response to two inmates peering into Section B's third level showers during the time when Randy Payne was fighting. <i>Compare</i> Resp. at 6 <i>with supra</i> ¶ 28. According to them, \"[t]he only conclusion to be drawn [from this situation] is that she deliberately ignored a known risk of inmate assault.\"<sup>[61]</sup> Resp. at 6.</p>\n<p>76. The Paynes fail to carry their summary judgment burden. Showing nothing more than the breach of a prison rule or regulation, which is all they really do, <i>see</i> Resp. at 6, establishes no Eighth Amendment violation. <i>See Langston,</i> 100 F.3d at 1238 (\"But ignoring internal prison procedures does not mean that a constitutional violation has occurred.\"); <i>Falls,</i> 966 F.2d at 380 (\"a prison official's violation of an internal regulation does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment claim ..., in the absence of objective evidence demonstrating that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a prisoner's constitutional rights\"); <i>see also </i><i>DesRosiers v.

Johnson's lack of success in challenging the Paynes' charge that she saw the fights involving Randy Payne in Section B on August 5, 1994, and failed to respond until they ended necessitates consideration of whether or not she should receive qualified immunity on this matter. <i>See supra</i> ¶ 10.</p>\n<p>78. Johnson must plead her good faith and establish that she was acting within the scope of her discretionary authority when her alleged misconduct transpired. <i>See </i><i>Saldana,</i> 684 F.2d at 1163 &amp; n. 14. She carries this burden by establishing that she was on duty in the control room of Pod C's guard tower at the time of the altercations between Randy Payne and other prisoners in Section B.<sup>[63]</sup><i>Compare supra</i> ¶ 26 <i>with</i> note 26.</p>\n<p>79. Because Johnson makes her requisite showing, the Paynes must present enough evidence to create a genuine issue as to whether or not she violated a clearly constitutional right, and, if so, whether or not her behavior was objectively unreasonable in light of that right.</p>\n<p>80. The Paynes carry their summary judgment burden. Specifically, they offer significant probative evidence raising a reasonable inference that Johnson witnessed the violence in Section B but took no action until it stopped. <i>See supra</i> ¶ 73.

Most of the duty posts inside a prison require a lot of responsibility, so whether an employee's been responsible or not so responsible in the past, we're still going to put them in one of those key posts.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Q: And whoever assigned the guards to transport that person [with close custody status] put a guard with one day experience, or two guardboth guards to transport him had one day of experience, you, as warden of the prison, couldn't have stepped in and said, \"No, I want these guys with five years of experience who have seen this before, I want them to do transportation.\"?</p>\n<p>A: I disagree with the theory of what you said, now</p>\n<p>Q: I'm just asking whether you as warden </p>\n<p>A: I could have done that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q: You, as warden, could have done that?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>Q: You didn't take any active steps to eliminate [demands for \"protection money\"] ..., for example, you didn't assign more experienced guards to close custody areas, correct?</p>\n<p>A: I didn't change the procedures that were that were in place, no.</p>\n<p>Price Dep. at 53-54, 82, 130.</p>\n<p>[35]  In the following exchange, Price explained his responsibility as to cell assignment decisions:\n</p>\n<p>Q: So you're saying, as warden, you could go for three hundred and sixty-five days in a row and not make a single autonomous decision and your prison run like a top?</p>\n<p>A: Well, I don't know if it'd run like a top or not, but there'sthere's not a lot of particularly large areas thatthat you have the autonomy to make decisions in, no, I mean</p>\n<p>Q: you're saying virtually every single decision is made for you?</p>\n<p>A: As far as major program impact, most of those are done. How many correctional officers you have, what your budget looks like, how many school teachers you're going to have, what the classification makeup of your unit's going to be; you know, all the critical things that make prison a prison, all of those are done outside of the unit itself.</p>\n<p>Q: What about where to put an inmate within your prison?</p>\n<p>A: That one is done internally at the unit?</p>\n<p>Q: Okay. And you are the head man at the unit, right?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: I mean, the final buck stops with you?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: And the people, whether you make the decision on where to put someone in a particularin your particular prison or its made by someone else, you're the one who's ultimately responsible for that decision, correct?</p>\n<p>A: I don't know if I'd agree with that or not.</p>\n<p>Q: Well, would you agree that if Wayne Scott or ... [James A.] Collins ... if those two guys are upset about the placement of an inmate within a particular unit, they're going to come to you first, right?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: And they're going to want to know why youthey want to hearthey'rethey are going to want to hear your explanation as to how something might have occurred, correct?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Price Dep. at 41-42.</p>\n<p>[36]  The record provides no insight on two issues related to Price's decision to end the \"free and frequent access\" policy. First, it gives no indication of exactly when Price authorized the modification of the \"free and frequent access\" policy. <i>See</i> Price Dep. at 93-94; Pina Dep. at 121-22. Second, it fails to explain how Price's termination of the \"free and frequent access\" policy squared with the need for a party to secure judicial approval before departing from the terms of the <i>Ruiz</i> Stipulation relevant to this case, <i>see supra</i> note 12.</p>\n<p>[37]  This situation arises only \"[u]nder exceptional circumstances.\" <i>Reeves v.

As such, it provides no basis for holding either of these officials liable for an Eighth Amendment violation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Woods,</i> 51 F.3d at 583.</p>\n<p>[49]  The Paynes presumably consider Johnson's practice of permitting prisoners to move between Sections as further heightening the danger to Caucasian prisoners in Pod C. <i>See</i> Resp. at 7.</p>\n<p>[50]  The Paynes apparently believe that Price's admission that he sanctioned a change in the \"free and frequent access\" policy raises an inference that he approved the policy. <i>Compare</i> Resp. at 9 (citing Price Dep. at 93-94) <i>with</i> Price Dep. at 93-94.</p>\n<p>[51]  The Paynes seem to consider the practice of placing close custody Hispanic inmates from South Texas and close custody inmates from West Texas in different Buildings to represent one aspect of the geographic housing policy. <i>See</i> Resp. at 9 &amp; n. 3. <i>See generally</i> note 17.</p>\n<p>[52]  The Paynes base their criticism of Price's failure to impose more stringent experience and competency requirements on COs working in close custody areas on the Operational Review Report's concern about the high concentration of COs with little relative experience on the second shift and Johnson's receipt of a \"[l]ow\" score for \"[r]esponsibility\" when she sought employment with the TDCJ-ID in 1993. <i>See</i> Resp. at 5.</p>\n<p>[53]  As the evidence fails to establish Price as directly participating in the decision on where to house Randy Payne, <i>see supra</i> note 25, any belief on the Paynes' part that he is liable because of personal involvement in that matter is unfounded. <i>See </i><i>Hilton v. Zavaras,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></span> (10th Cir.1995) (defendants' lack of personal involvement in decisions on cell assignments merits summary judgment in their favor).</p>\n<p>[54]  Even if the practice of housing Hispanic close custody inmates from South Texas and Hispanic close custody inmates from West Texas in different Buildings constituted a facet of the geographic housing policy, <i>see supra</i> note 17, this conclusion that Price just wrongly assessed the geographic housing policy's effect on prison security remains unchanged, <i>cf. supra</i> note 33.</p>\n<p>[55]  The Paynes offer no affirmative evidence raising a question about the sincerity of Price's outlook on the geographic housing policy. <i>See</i> Resp. at 5 (just citing page 38 of Price's deposition); Resp. at 9 (just citing pages 139 and 140 of Price's deposition). <i>See generally supra</i> notes 7, 8.</p>\n<p>[56]  Price cannot be held liable for inadequacies in the TDCJ-ID's training and certification standards because he played no role in setting them, <i>supra</i> note 22. <i>See </i><i>Coleman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740508\"><a href=\"/opinion/740508/barbara-coleman-v-houston-independent-school-district-anita-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 534 (plaintiff asserting constitutional claim under Section 1983 may not prevail based on a theory of respondeat inferior).</p>\n<p>[57]  The imposition of stronger experience and competency standards for COs working in close custody areas is the only ameliorative measure to which the Paynes specifically point. <i>See</i> Resp. at 5-6, 8-10.</p>\n<p>[58]  Some courts recognize that prison officials are not compelled under the Eighth Amendment to intercede in prisoner tussles when doing so would jeopardize their physical well-being. <i>See </i><i>Winfield v.
