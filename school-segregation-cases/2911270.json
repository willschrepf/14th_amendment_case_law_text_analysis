Plaintiffs San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Com-\nmerce Political Action Committee and COMPAC Issues\nFund, which are local political organizations, collected more\nthan $250 per person and actively campaigned in a qualifying\nlocal election. Defendant San Jose Elections Commission, the\n\f               SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE              14471\nlocal governmental entity established by the City to enforce\nits campaign finance laws, investigated Plaintiffs’ activities\nand concluded that Plaintiffs had violated section 12.06.310.\nThe Commission decided to issue a public reprimand and to\nassess a fine against Plaintiffs.\n\n   After the Commission issued a public reprimand, but\nbefore it could assess the fine, Plaintiffs filed this 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 action in federal district court. The district court\ndenied Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings,\nwhich asked the court to abstain under Younger v. Harris, 401\nU.S. 37 (1971). The court held that the contributions limit was\nunconstitutional and granted declaratory and injunctive relief\nto Plaintiffs. We hold that the district court was required to\nabstain under Younger. We therefore vacate the judgment and\nremand with instructions to dismiss this action.\n\n       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n   Voters in the city of San Jose, California, passed an amend-\nment to the City Charter that required the mayor and city\ncouncil to adopt limitations on campaign contributions for\ncertain elected city positions. Pursuant to that directive, the\ncity council enacted, among other laws, San Jose Municipal\nCode section 12.06.310:\n\n    Contribution limitations to independent\n    committees.\n\n    A. No person shall make nor shall any person\n    accept any contribution to or on behalf of an inde-\n    pendent committee expending funds or making con-\n    tributions in aid of and/or opposition to the\n    nomination or election of a candidate for city council\n    or mayor which will cause the total amount contrib-\n    uted by such person to such independent committee\n    to exceed two hundred fifty dollars per election.\n\f14472             SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n      B. Independent committees contributing to election\n      campaigns in addition to city of San José council or\n      mayoral campaigns shall segregate contributions\n      received and contributions or expenditures made for\n      the purpose of influencing such San José elections\n      from all other contributions or expenditures. Where\n      an independent committee has segregated such con-\n      tributions and expenditures for such city elections,\n      contributors to that committee may contribute more\n      than two hundred fifty dollars so long as no portion\n      of the contribution in excess of two hundred fifty\n      dollars is used to influence San José council or may-\n      oral elections.\n\n      C. This section is not intended to prohibit or regu-\n      late contributions to independent committees to the\n      extent such contributions are used on behalf of or in\n      opposition to candidates for offices other than may-\n      oral or council offices of the city of San José.\n\n   Beginning on May 16, 2006, Plaintiffs mailed informa-\ntional flyers and placed automated telephone calls to voters in\nSan Jose. The flyers and telephone messages referred to a spe-\ncific candidate for mayor in the upcoming June 6, 2006, pri-\nmary election.\n\n   In response to a citizen complaint filed on May 17, 2006,\nthe Commission began an investigation into whether the fly-\ners and telephone messages violated the contribution limits in\nSan Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310.1 An independent\nevaluator conducted an investigation and presented its written\nreport to the Commission (“Commission Report”). On May\n31, 2006, the Commission adopted the Commission Report\n  1\n    The Commission also investigated whether Plaintiffs’ activities vio-\nlated a separate limitation on independent expenditures. The Commission\nultimately concluded that there was no expenditure violation. That finding\ndoes not factor into this appeal.\n\f               SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE               14473\nand concluded that Plaintiffs had violated the contribution\nlimits in section 12.06.310.\n\n   The Commission decided to assess two penalties at a future\ndate: a statement of public reprimand and a fine to be calcu-\nlated based on the amount of contributions Plaintiffs received\nin excess of the contributions limit. On June 21, 2006, the\nCommission issued a statement of public reprimand. To date,\nthe Commission has not assessed the fine against Plaintiffs,\nbecause it has been unable to calculate the amount of the fine.\nThe Commission asserts that Plaintiffs have refused to pro-\nvide the necessary financial information.\n\n   On July 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal dis-\ntrict court, alleging that Defendants’ actions violated 42\nU.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs bring both a facial challenge and an\nas-applied challenge to San Jose Municipal Code section\n12.06.310. Plaintiffs claim that, on its face, the ordinance is\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, and that it impermissibly restricts\nPlaintiffs’ right to free speech, in violation of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs also assert that, as applied\nto their 2006 mailers and telephone messages, the Commis-\nsion’s decision and section 12.06.310 violate the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.\n\n   The complaint concludes with the following prayers for\nrelief:\n\n      1. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing SJMC [San Jose Municipal Code] section\n    12.06.310 unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,\n    and therefore invalid, as set forth above;\n\n       2. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310 is unconstitutional and\n    invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n    to the United States Constitution, as set forth above;\n\f14474          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n      3. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing the Commission Report, as a state action by the\n    Commission, unconstitutional and invalid under the\n    First and Fourteenth Amendments, as set forth\n    above;\n\n       4. For temporary, preliminary and permanent\n    injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from enforc-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310 against COMPAC or\n    any others similarly situated, as set forth above;\n\n       5. For temporary, preliminary and permanent\n    injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from enforc-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310, as construed in the\n    Commission Report, against COMPAC or any others\n    similarly situated, as set forth above;\n\n      6. [Costs and attorney fees, as allowed by statute];\n    and\n\n      7. The Court grant such other relief as may be\n    proper.\n\nIn the body of the complaint, Plaintiffs requested two specific\nforms of relief:\n\n       COMPAC is also entitled to the declaratory judg-\n    ment of this Court ordering Defendants to rescind\n    the formal reprimand of COMPAC issued on June\n    21, 2006 for COMPAC’s alleged violation of section\n    12.06.310.\n\n       COMPAC is entitled to injunctive relief against\n    Defendants enjoining them from enforcing SJMC\n    section 12.06.310 against COMPAC as construed by\n    the Commission Report, including but not limited to\n    enjoining Defendants from levying any civil penalty\n\f                 SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                 14475\n      or future administrative sanction against COMPAC\n      for alleged violations of SJMC section 12.06.310.\n\n(Paragraph number headings omitted.)\n\n   Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings arguing,\namong other things, that the district court was required to\nabstain under Younger. Both parties filed motions for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court denied Defendants’ motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings, denied Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment, and granted Plaintiffs’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court held that the proper remedy\nwas for the court “to invalidate the statute and enjoin its\nenforcement.”\n\n   The district court’s judgment included declaratory and\ninjunctive relief:\n\n         1. The Court declares that San Jose Municipal\n      Code Section 12.06.310 violates the First and Four-\n      teenth Amendments to the United States Constitu-\n      tion.\n\n        2. Defendants are permanently enjoined from\n      enforcing San Jose Municipal Code Section\n      12.06.310 against Plaintiffs.\n\nDefendants timely appeal.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n   [1] Younger abstention2 is a jurisprudential doctrine rooted\nin overlapping principles of equity, comity, and federalism.\nSee Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 460-73 (1974)\n(explaining the history and purposes of the doctrine); Youn-\n  2\n   We review de novo whether Younger abstention applies. Gilbertson v.\nAlbright, 381 F.3d 965, 982 n.19 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc).\n\f14476           SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\nger, 401 U.S. at 43-49 (discussing the jurisprudential back-\nground of abstention); Gilbertson v. Albright, 381 F.3d 965,\n970-75 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (tracing the Supreme Court’s\napplication of the doctrine). We must abstain under Younger\nif four requirements are met: (1) a state-initiated proceeding\nis ongoing; (2) the proceeding implicates important state\ninterests; (3) the federal plaintiff is not barred from litigating\nfederal constitutional issues in the state proceeding; and (4)\nthe federal court action would enjoin the proceeding or have\nthe practical effect of doing so, i.e., would interfere with the\nstate proceeding in a way that Younger disapproves. Gilbert-\nson, 381 F.3d at 978; AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Roden\n(“ABC”), 495 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Green\nv. City of Tucson, 255 F.3d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001) (en\nbanc) (“[I]n addressing Younger abstention issues, district\ncourts must exercise jurisdiction except when specific legal\nstandards are met, and may not exercise jurisdiction when\nthose standards are met; there is no discretion vested in the\ndistrict courts to do otherwise.”), overruled in other part by\nGilbertson, 381 F.3d 965. An exception to that general rule\nexists if there is a “showing of bad faith, harassment, or some\nother extraordinary circumstance that would make abstention\ninappropriate.” Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden\nState Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 435 (1982). Although Younger\nitself involved potential interference with a state criminal\ncase, the Supreme Court has extended the doctrine to federal\ncases that would interfere with state civil cases and state\nadministrative proceedings. Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v.\nDayton Christian Sch., Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 627 (1986). “As\nvirtually all cases discussing [Younger abstention] emphasize,\nthe limited circumstances in which abstention by federal\ncourts is appropriate remain the exception rather than the\nrule.” ABC, 495 F.3d at 1148 (internal quotation marks and\nellipsis omitted).\n\n  A.    Ongoing State Proceeding\n\n   [2] The state-initiated proceeding in this case—the Elec-\ntions Commission’s investigation of Plaintiffs’ activities—is\n\f                SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE              14477\nongoing. After concluding that Plaintiffs had violated San\nJose Municipal Code section 12.06.310, the Commission\ndecided to impose two sanctions: a public reprimand and a\nfine. A month later, it issued the public reprimand. But, appar-\nently because Plaintiffs have failed to provide the necessary\nfinancial information, the Commission has not yet assessed\nany fine.\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that, because the Commission has decided\nthat a violation occurred, the proceeding is no longer ongoing.\nWe disagree. The transcript of the Commission’s hearing\nmakes clear that the proceeding has not concluded:\n\n       MR. MERTENS: . . . So my understanding is that\n    we’ve covered the finding of a violation, and we’ve\n    also covered the action we’re going to take, which is\n    going to be imposing a penalty, as well as issuing a\n    public reprimand. And the — we will determine at\n    a future date the number of violations and the pen-\n    alty that will be imposed by the Commission.\n\n       MR. SATO: Mr. Chair, clarification. Are you also\n    directing the Commission’s evaluator to proceed\n    with an investigation as to the number of potential\n    violations?\n\n      MR. MERTENS: If that is the recommended\n    course of action.\n\n[Commission then moves for a vote, and votes in favor of that\ncourse of action.]\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n   [3] The status of the Commission’s proceeding is analogous\nto the status of a civil case in which the district court has\nresolved liability but has not finalized relief. See Riley v. Ken-\nnedy, 128 S. Ct. 1970, 1981 (2008) (“We have long held that\n\f14478             SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\nan order resolving liability without addressing a plaintiff’s\nrequests for relief is not final.”). The procedure here is also\nanalogous to a criminal case in which the trier of fact has\ndetermined guilt, but the court has not imposed a sentence. In\nthat circumstance, no final judgment has been entered, and the\nproceeding is plainly ongoing.3 See Corey v. United States,\n375 U.S. 169, 174 (1963) (“Final judgment in a criminal case\n. . . means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). There is no principled distinction\nbetween finality of judgments for purposes of appellate\nreview and finality of state-initiated proceedings for purposes\nof Younger abstention. We therefore hold that the administra-\ntive proceeding is “ongoing” for purposes of Younger absten-\ntion.\n\n   At oral argument, Plaintiffs’ lawyer observed that a state\nadministrative agency could intentionally delay completion of\na proceeding so as to thwart state-court and federal-court\nreview. As we have noted, an exception to Younger abstention\napplies upon a “showing of bad faith, harassment, or some\nother extraordinary circumstance.” Middlesex, 457 U.S. at\n435. Plaintiffs’ hypothetical example would fall under that\nexception but, here, Plaintiffs have not argued that Defendants\nhave acted in bad faith and the record does not support such\na finding. Indeed, it appears that any delay has been caused\nby Plaintiffs, first by refusing to provide the necessary finan-\ncial information and then by filing this federal action, only six\nweeks after the Elections Commission’s decision to impose a\nfine.\n\n   We pause to note an important legal issue that we need not\nand do not reach. Under California law, an aggrieved party\nmay challenge a final administrative action in state court by\npetitioning for a writ of mandate. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code\n§ 1094.5. If a state administrative proceeding is final, and\n  3\n    This analogy is particularly apt where, as in many criminal cases (typi-\ncally misdemeanors), the only sentence imposed is a fine.\n\f               SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE              14479\nstate-court judicial review is available but has not been\ninvoked, is the state proceeding nevertheless “ongoing” for\npurposes of Younger abstention? In other words, must federal\ncourts view the administrative proceeding and the possibility\nfor state-court review as one unitary proceeding? The\nSupreme Court has stated that this is an open question. New\nOrleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans\n(“NOPSI”), 491 U.S. 350, 370 n.4 (1989); see also id. at 374\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the judgment) (stating that he\nwould hold that the proceedings are unitary); id. at 374-75\n(Blackmun, J., concurring in the judgment) (stating that he is\n“not entirely persuaded” that the question is open).\n\n   Seven circuits have addressed this question. Four have held\nthat the administrative proceeding and the possibility for state\ncourt review are to be viewed as one unitary proceeding, and\nthree have held the opposite. Compare Maymo-Melendez v.\nAlvarez-Ramirez, 364 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Younger\nnow has to be read as treating the state process [the adminis-\ntrative proceeding and the possibility for state-court review]\n. . . as a continuum from start to finish.”), Majors v. Engel-\nbrecht, 149 F.3d 709, 713 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that the\nstate proceeding is ongoing, even assuming that the adminis-\ntrative proceeding is final and state-court review had not\nbegun), O’Neill v. City of Philadelphia, 32 F.3d 785, 790-91\n(3d Cir. 1994) (joining the majority rule and observing that\n“[w]e have been given no reason why a litigant in a state\nadministrative proceeding should be permitted to forego state-\ncourt judicial review of the agency’s decision in order to\napply for relief in federal court”), and Alleghany Corp. v.\nPomeroy, 898 F.2d 1314, 1316-17 (8th Cir. 1990) (noting that\nthe Supreme Court left the question open and deciding that\nthe proceedings are unitary), with Norfolk & W. Ry. Co. v.\nPub. Utils. Comm’n, 926 F.2d 567, 572 (6th Cir. 1991)\n(agreeing that “a state administrative enforcement proceeding\nis no longer pending when the agency proceeding has been\ncompleted, notwithstanding the availability of state appellate\nreview”), CECOS Int’l, Inc. v. Jorling, 895 F.2d 66, 72 (2d\n\f14480           SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\nCir. 1990) (holding that an aggrieved party may choose\nbetween petitioning the state court for review and filing a fed-\neral § 1983 claim), and Thomas v. Tex. State Bd. of Med.\nExam’rs, 807 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir. 1987) (“The mere avail-\nability of state judicial review of state administrative proceed-\nings does not amount to the pendency of state judicial\nproceedings within the meaning of Huffman[ v. Pursue, Ltd.,\n420 U.S. 592 (1975)].”).\n\n   Although we briefly joined the majority rule in 1993, that\nopinion was withdrawn, and we have not addressed the ques-\ntion since then. See Nev. Entm’t Indus., Inc. v. City of Hender-\nson, 8 F.3d 1348 (9th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (joining\nmajority rule), withdrawn by 21 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.), on reh’g\n26 F.3d 131 (9th Cir. 1994) (unpublished disposition) (hold-\ning that the Younger abstention question was moot); see also\nKleenwell Biohazard Waste & Gen. Ecology Consultants, Inc.\nv. Nelson, 48 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting that the\nquestion is open in this circuit, but declining to reach it).\nBecause, here, the administrative proceeding itself is ongoing,\nwe do not reach the issue.\n\n  B.    Important State Interest\n\n   Younger abstention is required only if the state proceeding\n“implicates important state interests.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n978. “The importance of the interest is measured by consider-\ning its significance broadly, rather than by focusing on the\nstate’s interest in the resolution of an individual’s case.” Baf-\nfert v. Cal. Horse Racing Bd., 332 F.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir.\n2003). For example, we have held that a state’s interest in\n“[p]reserving the integrity of [horse] racing is a significant\ninterest.” Id.; see also Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 434-35 (holding\nthat a state’s interest in regulating the ethical standards of\nlawyers is an important state interest). The state’s interest here\n—regulating its local elections—is likewise an important state\ninterest.\n\f                SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                14481\n    [4] “Whether the state proceedings are ‘judicial in nature’\n. . . also plays a role in assessing the significance of the state\ninterest.” Baffert, 332 F.3d at 618. “[J]udicial proceedings or\ndisciplinary proceedings which are judicial in nature are the\ntype of proceeding that does implicate an important state\ninterest. However, a state proceeding which is nonjudicial or\ninvolves the interpretation of completed legislative or execu-\ntive action is not of that character.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n977 (citations omitted). The Elections Commission’s proceed-\ning involved the investigation of the facts of Plaintiffs’ mail-\ning and telephoning campaign and the application of the law\nto those facts—a proceeding plainly “judicial in nature.” See\nNOPSI, 491 U.S. at 369-73 (discussing the hallmarks of a\nproceeding that is “judicial in nature”); Middlesex, 457 U.S.\nat 432-34 (same).\n\n   Plaintiffs do not argue that regulation of local elections\ngenerally is not an important state interest. Nor do they argue\nthat the Elections Commission’s proceeding was not judicial\nin nature. Instead, they focus on the city council’s enactment\nof San Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310. Plaintiffs\ninsist that, because they bring only a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of section 12.06.310, do not challenge the\nCommission’s proceeding, and seek only prospective relief,\nYounger abstention does not apply.\n\n   Plaintiffs’ contentions are inaccurate. As the quoted por-\ntions of their complaint make clear, Plaintiffs bring both a\nfacial challenge and an as-applied challenge; they do chal-\nlenge the Commission’s proceeding; and they do seek retro-\nspective relief. And, critically, the relief that Plaintiffs request\nis inextricably intertwined with the Elections Commission’s\nproceeding: Plaintiffs requested (and the district court ruled)\nthat Defendants be enjoined from enforcing section 12.06.310\nagainst them, i.e., that the Elections Commission be enjoined\nfrom collecting the fine that it decided to impose (in an\namount yet to be determined).\n\f14482          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Younger abstention applies\nonly to cases in which a plaintiff challenges the procedures of\nthe state proceeding, which Plaintiffs do not challenge here.\nAlthough some of the cases applying Younger abstention\ninvolve challenges to the underlying procedures employed by\nthe agency or court, e.g., Middlesex, many involve constitu-\ntional challenges to a state’s statute. In fact, Younger itself\nwas such a case. See Younger, 401 U.S. at 40 (noting that the\ncase presented the question “whether the State’s law is consti-\ntutional on its face”); see also Huffman, 420 U.S. at 598-99,\n610 (applying Younger abstention to a constitutional chal-\nlenge to a state’s statute).\n\n  C.    Opportunity to Litigate Federal Constitutional Issues\n\n   [5] In order for Younger abstention to apply, Plaintiffs must\nhave had an opportunity to litigate their federal constitutional\nchallenges to the San Jose Municipal Code. Plaintiffs cor-\nrectly observe that the Elections Commission did not con-\nsider, and likely could not have considered, federal\nconstitutional questions. But that observation does not resolve\nthe inquiry. Under California law, Plaintiffs can petition for\na writ of mandate to challenge the administrative action in\nstate court, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1094.5. That procedure\nsuffices for purposes of Younger abstention. See Kenneally v.\nLungren, 967 F.2d 329, 332-33 (9th Cir. 1992) (examining\nthe California writ of mandate procedure and holding that\n“[t]his statutory framework provides a meaningful opportu-\nnity for [the federal plaintiff] to present his constitutional\nclaims for independent judicial review prior to the Board’s\ndecision becoming effective”); see also Baffert, 332 F.3d at\n620 (applying Kenneally).\n\n  D.    Interference\n\n  [6] The final Younger requirement is that the federal suit\nwould “interfere” with the ongoing state proceeding (i.e.,\nenjoin or have the practical effect of enjoining the proceed-\n\f                   SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                      14483\ning). Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 978. Plaintiffs sought, and the\ndistrict court granted, a permanent injunction against Defen-\ndants to preclude them from enforcing the statute. That\ninjunction consequently prohibits the Elections Commission\nfrom imposing the fine against Plaintiffs. The relief sought\ntherefore would “interfere” with the Elections Commission’s\nproceeding, because it would “enjoin . . . or otherwise involve\nthe federal courts in terminating or truncating” the Elections\nCommission’s proceeding. Green, 255 F.3d at 1098.4\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n   [7] The Elections Commission’s proceeding is an “ongo-\ning” “state-initiated proceeding” that “implicates important\nstate interests”; Plaintiffs are “not barred from litigating fed-\neral constitutional issues”; and the “federal court action . . .\nwould enjoin the [state] proceeding.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n978. Because there has been no showing of bad faith, harass-\nment, or an extraordinary circumstance, we must abstain. We\ntherefore do not reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ constitutional\nchallenges to San Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310, and\nthe district court should not have done so.\n  4\n    In Green, sitting en banc, we held that there must be “direct interfer-\nence” with the state proceeding. 255 F.3d at 1100. That holding is no lon-\nger good law. Sitting en banc again, we held that the interference need not\nbe direct. Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 978. See ABC, 495 F.3d at 1149 n.9\n(“Gilbertson did overrule Green’s holding that ‘ “direct interference” is a\nthreshold requirement . . . of Younger abstention,’ but it left intact the\nmore general requirement that some interference with state court proceed-\nings is a necessary . . . element of the Younger doctrine.” (citation omitted)\n(first ellipsis in original)). Gilbertson expanded the interference require-\nment to cases in which the relief sought (such as money damages against\nthe individuals on an administrative board) “would have the same practical\neffect on the state proceeding as a formal injunction.” 381 F.3d at 977-78.\nWe need not examine the intricacies of the interference requirement\nbecause, here, the federal court action would “interfere” with the state pro-\nceedings even under Green’s restricted test.\n\f14484          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n   We agree with Plaintiffs, of course, that political speech is\nvitally important. But the Supreme Court has never suggested\nthat the importance of the interest asserted by a federal plain-\ntiff affects the analysis of the Younger factors. Indeed, it\nwould be hard to assert that the right to speech is more impor-\ntant than the liberty interest of the criminal defendant in Youn-\nger itself, where the Court held that federal courts were\nrequired to abstain.\n\n   Judgment VACATED. REMANDED with instructions to\ndismiss the case.

The district court\ndenied Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings,\nwhich asked the court to abstain under Younger v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). The court held that the contributions limit was\nunconstitutional and granted declaratory and injunctive relief\nto Plaintiffs. We hold that the district court was required to\nabstain under Younger. We therefore vacate the judgment and\nremand with instructions to dismiss this action.\n\n       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n   Voters in the city of San Jose, California, passed an amend-\nment to the City Charter that required the mayor and city\ncouncil to adopt limitations on campaign contributions for\ncertain elected city positions. Pursuant to that directive, the\ncity council enacted, among other laws, San Jose Municipal\nCode section 12.06.310:\n\n    Contribution limitations to independent\n    committees.\n\n    A. No person shall make nor shall any person\n    accept any contribution to or on behalf of an inde-\n    pendent committee expending funds or making con-\n    tributions in aid of and/or opposition to the\n    nomination or election of a candidate for city council\n    or mayor which will cause the total amount contrib-\n    uted by such person to such independent committee\n    to exceed two hundred fifty dollars per election.\n\f14472             SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n      B. Independent committees contributing to election\n      campaigns in addition to city of San José council or\n      mayoral campaigns shall segregate contributions\n      received and contributions or expenditures made for\n      the purpose of influencing such San José elections\n      from all other contributions or expenditures. Where\n      an independent committee has segregated such con-\n      tributions and expenditures for such city elections,\n      contributors to that committee may contribute more\n      than two hundred fifty dollars so long as no portion\n      of the contribution in excess of two hundred fifty\n      dollars is used to influence San José council or may-\n      oral elections.\n\n      C. This section is not intended to prohibit or regu-\n      late contributions to independent committees to the\n      extent such contributions are used on behalf of or in\n      opposition to candidates for offices other than may-\n      oral or council offices of the city of San José.\n\n   Beginning on May 16, 2006, Plaintiffs mailed informa-\ntional flyers and placed automated telephone calls to voters in\nSan Jose. The flyers and telephone messages referred to a spe-\ncific candidate for mayor in the upcoming June 6, 2006, pri-\nmary election.\n\n   In response to a citizen complaint filed on May 17, 2006,\nthe Commission began an investigation into whether the fly-\ners and telephone messages violated the contribution limits in\nSan Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310.1 An independent\nevaluator conducted an investigation and presented its written\nreport to the Commission (“Commission Report”). On May\n31, 2006, the Commission adopted the Commission Report\n  1\n    The Commission also investigated whether Plaintiffs’ activities vio-\nlated a separate limitation on independent expenditures. The Commission\nultimately concluded that there was no expenditure violation. That finding\ndoes not factor into this appeal.\n\f               SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE               14473\nand concluded that Plaintiffs had violated the contribution\nlimits in section 12.06.310.\n\n   The Commission decided to assess two penalties at a future\ndate: a statement of public reprimand and a fine to be calcu-\nlated based on the amount of contributions Plaintiffs received\nin excess of the contributions limit. On June 21, 2006, the\nCommission issued a statement of public reprimand. To date,\nthe Commission has not assessed the fine against Plaintiffs,\nbecause it has been unable to calculate the amount of the fine.\nThe Commission asserts that Plaintiffs have refused to pro-\nvide the necessary financial information.\n\n   On July 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal dis-\ntrict court, alleging that Defendants’ actions violated 42\nU.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs bring both a facial challenge and an\nas-applied challenge to San Jose Municipal Code section\n12.06.310. Plaintiffs claim that, on its face, the ordinance is\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, and that it impermissibly restricts\nPlaintiffs’ right to free speech, in violation of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs also assert that, as applied\nto their 2006 mailers and telephone messages, the Commis-\nsion’s decision and section 12.06.310 violate the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.\n\n   The complaint concludes with the following prayers for\nrelief:\n\n      1. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing SJMC [San Jose Municipal Code] section\n    12.06.310 unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,\n    and therefore invalid, as set forth above;\n\n       2. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310 is unconstitutional and\n    invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n    to the United States Constitution, as set forth above;\n\f14474          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n      3. For declaratory judgment of this Court, declar-\n    ing the Commission Report, as a state action by the\n    Commission, unconstitutional and invalid under the\n    First and Fourteenth Amendments, as set forth\n    above;\n\n       4. For temporary, preliminary and permanent\n    injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from enforc-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310 against COMPAC or\n    any others similarly situated, as set forth above;\n\n       5. For temporary, preliminary and permanent\n    injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from enforc-\n    ing SJMC section 12.06.310, as construed in the\n    Commission Report, against COMPAC or any others\n    similarly situated, as set forth above;\n\n      6. [Costs and attorney fees, as allowed by statute];\n    and\n\n      7. The Court grant such other relief as may be\n    proper.\n\nIn the body of the complaint, Plaintiffs requested two specific\nforms of relief:\n\n       COMPAC is also entitled to the declaratory judg-\n    ment of this Court ordering Defendants to rescind\n    the formal reprimand of COMPAC issued on June\n    21, 2006 for COMPAC’s alleged violation of section\n    12.06.310.\n\n       COMPAC is entitled to injunctive relief against\n    Defendants enjoining them from enforcing SJMC\n    section 12.06.310 against COMPAC as construed by\n    the Commission Report, including but not limited to\n    enjoining Defendants from levying any civil penalty\n\f                 SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                 14475\n      or future administrative sanction against COMPAC\n      for alleged violations of SJMC section 12.06.310.\n\n(Paragraph number headings omitted.)\n\n   Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings arguing,\namong other things, that the district court was required to\nabstain under Younger. Both parties filed motions for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court denied Defendants’ motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings, denied Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment, and granted Plaintiffs’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment. The district court held that the proper remedy\nwas for the court “to invalidate the statute and enjoin its\nenforcement.”\n\n   The district court’s judgment included declaratory and\ninjunctive relief:\n\n         1. The Court declares that San Jose Municipal\n      Code Section 12.06.310 violates the First and Four-\n      teenth Amendments to the United States Constitu-\n      tion.\n\n        2. Defendants are permanently enjoined from\n      enforcing San Jose Municipal Code Section\n      12.06.310 against Plaintiffs.\n\nDefendants timely appeal.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n   [1] Younger abstention2 is a jurisprudential doctrine rooted\nin overlapping principles of equity, comity, and federalism.\nSee Steffel v.

Ongoing State Proceeding\n\n   [2] The state-initiated proceeding in this case—the Elec-\ntions Commission’s investigation of Plaintiffs’ activities—is\n\f                SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE              14477\nongoing. After concluding that Plaintiffs had violated San\nJose Municipal Code section 12.06.310, the Commission\ndecided to impose two sanctions: a public reprimand and a\nfine. A month later, it issued the public reprimand. But, appar-\nently because Plaintiffs have failed to provide the necessary\nfinancial information, the Commission has not yet assessed\nany fine.\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that, because the Commission has decided\nthat a violation occurred, the proceeding is no longer ongoing.\nWe disagree. The transcript of the Commission’s hearing\nmakes clear that the proceeding has not concluded:\n\n       MR. MERTENS: . . . So my understanding is that\n    we’ve covered the finding of a violation, and we’ve\n    also covered the action we’re going to take, which is\n    going to be imposing a penalty, as well as issuing a\n    public reprimand. And the — we will determine at\n    a future date the number of violations and the pen-\n    alty that will be imposed by the Commission.\n\n       MR. SATO: Mr. Chair, clarification. Are you also\n    directing the Commission’s evaluator to proceed\n    with an investigation as to the number of potential\n    violations?\n\n      MR. MERTENS: If that is the recommended\n    course of action.\n\n[Commission then moves for a vote, and votes in favor of that\ncourse of action.]\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n   [3] The status of the Commission’s proceeding is analogous\nto the status of a civil case in which the district court has\nresolved liability but has not finalized relief. See Riley v. Ken-\nnedy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145807\"><a href=\"/opinion/145807/riley-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The procedure here is also\nanalogous to a criminal case in which the trier of fact has\ndetermined guilt, but the court has not imposed a sentence. In\nthat circumstance, no final judgment has been entered, and the\nproceeding is plainly ongoing.3 See Corey v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106706\"><a href=\"/opinion/106706/corey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (1963) (“Final judgment in a criminal case\n. . . means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). There is no principled distinction\nbetween finality of judgments for purposes of appellate\nreview and finality of state-initiated proceedings for purposes\nof Younger abstention. We therefore hold that the administra-\ntive proceeding is “ongoing” for purposes of Younger absten-\ntion.\n\n   At oral argument, Plaintiffs’ lawyer observed that a state\nadministrative agency could intentionally delay completion of\na proceeding so as to thwart state-court and federal-court\nreview. As we have noted, an exception to Younger abstention\napplies upon a “showing of bad faith, harassment, or some\nother extraordinary circumstance.” Middlesex, 457 U.S. at\n435. Plaintiffs’ hypothetical example would fall under that\nexception but, here, Plaintiffs have not argued that Defendants\nhave acted in bad faith and the record does not support such\na finding. Indeed, it appears that any delay has been caused\nby Plaintiffs, first by refusing to provide the necessary finan-\ncial information and then by filing this federal action, only six\nweeks after the Elections Commission’s decision to impose a\nfine.\n\n   We pause to note an important legal issue that we need not\nand do not reach. Under California law, an aggrieved party\nmay challenge a final administrative action in state court by\npetitioning for a writ of mandate. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code\n§ 1094.5. If a state administrative proceeding is final, and\n  3\n    This analogy is particularly apt where, as in many criminal cases (typi-\ncally misdemeanors), the only sentence imposed is a fine.\n\f               SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE              14479\nstate-court judicial review is available but has not been\ninvoked, is the state proceeding nevertheless “ongoing” for\npurposes of Younger abstention? In other words, must federal\ncourts view the administrative proceeding and the possibility\nfor state-court review as one unitary proceeding? The\nSupreme Court has stated that this is an open question. New\nOrleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.

Important State Interest\n\n   Younger abstention is required only if the state proceeding\n“implicates important state interests.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n978. “The importance of the interest is measured by consider-\ning its significance broadly, rather than by focusing on the\nstate’s interest in the resolution of an individual’s case.” Baf-\nfert v. Cal. Horse Racing Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782328\"><a href=\"/opinion/782328/bob-baffert-v-california-horse-racing-board-roy-c-wood-jr-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (9th Cir.\n2003). For example, we have held that a state’s interest in\n“[p]reserving the integrity of [horse] racing is a significant\ninterest.” Id.; see also Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 434-35 (holding\nthat a state’s interest in regulating the ethical standards of\nlawyers is an important state interest). The state’s interest here\n—regulating its local elections—is likewise an important state\ninterest.\n\f                SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                14481\n    [4] “Whether the state proceedings are ‘judicial in nature’\n. . . also plays a role in assessing the significance of the state\ninterest.” Baffert, 332 F.3d at 618. “[J]udicial proceedings or\ndisciplinary proceedings which are judicial in nature are the\ntype of proceeding that does implicate an important state\ninterest. However, a state proceeding which is nonjudicial or\ninvolves the interpretation of completed legislative or execu-\ntive action is not of that character.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n977 (citations omitted). The Elections Commission’s proceed-\ning involved the investigation of the facts of Plaintiffs’ mail-\ning and telephoning campaign and the application of the law\nto those facts—a proceeding plainly “judicial in nature.” See\nNOPSI, 491 U.S. at 369-73 (discussing the hallmarks of a\nproceeding that is “judicial in nature”); Middlesex, 457 U.S.\nat 432-34 (same).\n\n   Plaintiffs do not argue that regulation of local elections\ngenerally is not an important state interest. Nor do they argue\nthat the Elections Commission’s proceeding was not judicial\nin nature. Instead, they focus on the city council’s enactment\nof San Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310. Plaintiffs\ninsist that, because they bring only a facial challenge to the\nconstitutionality of section 12.06.310, do not challenge the\nCommission’s proceeding, and seek only prospective relief,\nYounger abstention does not apply.\n\n   Plaintiffs’ contentions are inaccurate. As the quoted por-\ntions of their complaint make clear, Plaintiffs bring both a\nfacial challenge and an as-applied challenge; they do chal-\nlenge the Commission’s proceeding; and they do seek retro-\nspective relief. And, critically, the relief that Plaintiffs request\nis inextricably intertwined with the Elections Commission’s\nproceeding: Plaintiffs requested (and the district court ruled)\nthat Defendants be enjoined from enforcing section 12.06.310\nagainst them, i.e., that the Elections Commission be enjoined\nfrom collecting the fine that it decided to impose (in an\namount yet to be determined).\n\f14482          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Younger abstention applies\nonly to cases in which a plaintiff challenges the procedures of\nthe state proceeding, which Plaintiffs do not challenge here.\nAlthough some of the cases applying Younger abstention\ninvolve challenges to the underlying procedures employed by\nthe agency or court, e.g., Middlesex, many involve constitu-\ntional challenges to a state’s statute. In fact, Younger itself\nwas such a case. See Younger, 401 U.S. at 40 (noting that the\ncase presented the question “whether the State’s law is consti-\ntutional on its face”); see also Huffman, 420 U.S. at 598-99,\n610 (applying Younger abstention to a constitutional chal-\nlenge to a state’s statute).\n\n  C.    Opportunity to Litigate Federal Constitutional Issues\n\n   [5] In order for Younger abstention to apply, Plaintiffs must\nhave had an opportunity to litigate their federal constitutional\nchallenges to the San Jose Municipal Code. Plaintiffs cor-\nrectly observe that the Elections Commission did not con-\nsider, and likely could not have considered, federal\nconstitutional questions. But that observation does not resolve\nthe inquiry. Under California law, Plaintiffs can petition for\na writ of mandate to challenge the administrative action in\nstate court, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1094.5. That procedure\nsuffices for purposes of Younger abstention. See Kenneally v.\nLungren, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585272\"><a href=\"/opinion/585272/dr-leo-f-kenneally-v-dan-lungren/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332-33 (9th Cir. 1992) (examining\nthe California writ of mandate procedure and holding that\n“[t]his statutory framework provides a meaningful opportu-\nnity for [the federal plaintiff] to present his constitutional\nclaims for independent judicial review prior to the Board’s\ndecision becoming effective”); see also Baffert, 332 F.3d at\n620 (applying Kenneally).\n\n  D.    Interference\n\n  [6] The final Younger requirement is that the federal suit\nwould “interfere” with the ongoing state proceeding (i.e.,\nenjoin or have the practical effect of enjoining the proceed-\n\f                   SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE                      14483\ning). Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 978. Plaintiffs sought, and the\ndistrict court granted, a permanent injunction against Defen-\ndants to preclude them from enforcing the statute. That\ninjunction consequently prohibits the Elections Commission\nfrom imposing the fine against Plaintiffs. The relief sought\ntherefore would “interfere” with the Elections Commission’s\nproceeding, because it would “enjoin . . . or otherwise involve\nthe federal courts in terminating or truncating” the Elections\nCommission’s proceeding. Green, 255 F.3d at 1098.4\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n   [7] The Elections Commission’s proceeding is an “ongo-\ning” “state-initiated proceeding” that “implicates important\nstate interests”; Plaintiffs are “not barred from litigating fed-\neral constitutional issues”; and the “federal court action . . .\nwould enjoin the [state] proceeding.” Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at\n978. Because there has been no showing of bad faith, harass-\nment, or an extraordinary circumstance, we must abstain. We\ntherefore do not reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ constitutional\nchallenges to San Jose Municipal Code section 12.06.310, and\nthe district court should not have done so.\n  4\n    In Green, sitting en banc, we held that there must be “direct interfer-\nence” with the state proceeding. 255 F.3d at 1100. That holding is no lon-\nger good law. Sitting en banc again, we held that the interference need not\nbe direct. Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 978. See ABC, 495 F.3d at 1149 n.9\n(“Gilbertson did overrule Green’s holding that ‘ “direct interference” is a\nthreshold requirement . . . of Younger abstention,’ but it left intact the\nmore general requirement that some interference with state court proceed-\nings is a necessary . . . element of the Younger doctrine.” (citation omitted)\n(first ellipsis in original)). Gilbertson expanded the interference require-\nment to cases in which the relief sought (such as money damages against\nthe individuals on an administrative board) “would have the same practical\neffect on the state proceeding as a formal injunction.” 381 F.3d at 977-78.\nWe need not examine the intricacies of the interference requirement\nbecause, here, the federal court action would “interfere” with the state pro-\nceedings even under Green’s restricted test.\n\f14484          SJSVCCPAC v. CITY OF SAN JOSE\n   We agree with Plaintiffs, of course, that political speech is\nvitally important. But the Supreme Court has never suggested\nthat the importance of the interest asserted by a federal plain-\ntiff affects the analysis of the Younger factors. Indeed, it\nwould be hard to assert that the right to speech is more impor-\ntant than the liberty interest of the criminal defendant in Youn-\nger itself, where the Court held that federal courts were\nrequired to abstain.\n\n   Judgment VACATED. REMANDED with instructions to\ndismiss the case. Costs on appeal are awarded to Defendants.\n\f\f                             PRINTED FOR\n                   ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE—U.S. COURTS\n                BY THOMSON REUTERS/WEST—SAN FRANCISCO\n\nThe summary, which does not constitute a part of the opinion of the court, is copyrighted\n                          © 2008 Thomson Reuters/West.\n\f</pre>",
