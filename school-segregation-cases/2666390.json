The panel\nconcluded that the prisoner failed to state a claim under the\nAct and the First Amendment. The panel further concluded\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nthe prisoner leave to amend.\n\n\n                         COUNSEL\n\nElliot Wong (argued), San Francisco, California, for Plaintiff-\nAppellant.\n\nKamala Harris, Attorney General of California, Jonathan L.\nWolff, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Thomas S.\nPatterson, Supervising Deputy Attorney General, Jose A.\nZelidon-Zepeda (argued), Deputy Attorney General, San\nFrancisco, California, for Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nTASHIMA, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Dennis Walker is a devout racist. He is an Aryan\nChristian Odinist incarcerated in a California state prison.\nThe Odinist religion forbids adherents from integrating with\nmembers of races other than their own and requires the\nperformance of rituals that may not be conducted in the\npresence of non-“Aryan” individuals. Walker challenges the\nState’s classification of him as eligible to occupy a prison cell\nwith an individual of a different race, alleging that such a\nplacement would interfere with his religious practice. He\nappeals the district court’s ruling that the State’s refusal to\n\f4                       WALKER V. BEARD\n\nexempt him from its Integrated Housing Policy (the “Housing\nPolicy”) did not violate the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§ a2000cc et seq., or the First Amendment. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We conclude that the\nState has a compelling interest in avoiding invidious racial\ndiscrimination and potential liability under the Equal\nProtection Clause, and the only way for the State to satisfy\nthis interest was to reject Walker’s request for an exemption\nfrom the Housing Policy. We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n    According to Walker, Odinism, the religion to which he\nadheres, calls on its followers to preserve the purity of the\nAryan race.1 To that end, Odinists are forbidden from\ninteracting with individuals of other races. Seeking to follow\nhis religious dictates, Walker requested that he be celled with\nan Aryan individual. The state rejected the request. Pursuant\nto the Housing Policy, Walker was classified as “racially\neligible,” allowing the prison to place him in a cell with an\nindividual of a different race.\n\n    The Housing Policy provides for prisoners to be classified\ninto one of five categories, including racially eligible and\n“restricted to own,” meaning ineligible to be placed in a\nmulti-race cell. There is a strong presumption in favor of\nracially eligible status. Under that policy, an inmate’s race\nmay not be a “primary determining factor” in determining his\n\n\n    1\n   Although the word “Aryan” has been variously used to describe Proto-\nIndo-Europeans and Hindus, Walker apparently uses it to refer only to\nwhite individuals of Northern European heritage. We follow that usage\nin this opinion.\n\f                        WALKER V. BEARD                                5\n\nhousing classification. Prison officials may, however,\nconsider certain race-related factors when classifying\ninmates, such as the prisoner’s history of perpetrating or\nbeing victimized by racial violence. A prisoner classified as\nracially eligible who refuses to accept a cellmate of another\nrace is not forced to accept integration, but rather is\ncategorized as “restricted by refusal” and subjected to\ndisciplinary action. Following his classification as racially\neligible, the prison assigned Walker a non-white cellmate and\nWalker refused the assignment. As discipline, the prison\nplaced him in administrative segregation.\n\n    Walker commenced this action pro se against Matthew\nCate, then-Secretary of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation, and Kathleen Dickerson, the\nwarden of the prison in which he was then housed (together\n“Defendants” or the “State”).2 He seeks damages and\ninjunctive relief for a variety of statutory and constitutional\nclaims, including claims under RLUIPA, and the First, Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Although inartfully\ndrafted, the complaint alleges that the State’s classification of\nWalker as racially eligible under the Housing Policy\nimpermissibly abridged his religious liberty by threatening a\nviolation of his “religious beliefs and practices.”\n\n    Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A magistrate judge\nrecommended granting the motion and dismissing all claims.\nStill proceeding pro se, Walker filed objections to the\nmagistrate judge’s findings and recommendations (“F&R”).\n\n\n 2\n   As best as can be determined, Walker appears to have brought claims\nagainst Defendants in both their official and personal capacities, and we\nso construe the complaint.\n\f6                    WALKER V. BEARD\n\nIn this new filing, for the first time, Walker provided\nadditional information about his practice of Odinism. Walker\nasserted that as part of his religious practice he engages in a\nritual known as “the spiritual circle of Odinist Warding” (the\n“warding ritual”) to communicate with his gods. Integrated\nhousing, according to Walker, would interfere with this ritual\nbecause the presence of a non-Aryan individual in his cell\nduring the ritual would “pollute” the spiritual circle.\nNotwithstanding Walker’s objections to the F&R, the district\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge’s F&R in full, dismissed\nWalker’s complaint for failure to state a claim, and denied\nleave to amend.\n\n    Now represented by counsel, Walker appeals the\ndismissal of his RLUIPA and First Amendment claims and\nthe denial of leave to amend.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s dismissal for failure\nto state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6). Stone v. Travelers Corp., 58 F.3d 434, 436–37 (9th\nCir. 1995). We review a district court’s denial of leave to\namend for abuse of discretion. Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d\n1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).\n\n                             III.\n\n    The State asserts that Walker’s action is moot because,\nsince filing his complaint, Walker has been transferred to a\nnew prison and has not alleged he is subject to integrated\n\f                        WALKER V. BEARD                               7\n\ncelling at that facility.3 A case is moot “when it has ‘lost its\ncharacter as a present, live controversy of the kind that must\nexist if [the court is] to avoid advisory opinions on abstract\npropositions of law.’” Oregon v. FERC, 636 F.3d 1203, 1206\n(9th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (quoting Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S.\n45, 48 (1969) (per curiam)). Because “[t]he jurisdiction of\nfederal courts depends on the existence of a ‘case or\ncontroversy’ under Article III of the Constitution,” we must\ndismiss an appeal that has become moot. Pub. Util. Comm’n\nof Cal. v. FERC, 100 F.3d 1451, 1458 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(quoting GTE Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 39 F.3d 940, 945 (9th Cir.\n1994)).\n\n    Our precedents elaborate on how the mootness bar applies\nto claims brought by prisoners subsequently transferred to\nnew prisons. In Dilley v. Gunn, a prisoner brought a\nconstitutional claim alleging denial of access to the courts on\nthe ground that the prison law library’s policies were overly\nrestrictive. 64 F.3d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir. 1995). We\nconcluded that the claim was moot because the prisoner had\nbeen transferred to another prison and did not demonstrate “a\nreasonable expectation that he [would be] . . . subjected\nagain” to the suspect library policies. Id. at 1368–69. By\ncontrast, in Nelson v. Heiss, we held that a prisoner’s claim\n\n\n 3\n   Walker asserts claims for both damages and injunctive relief, but we\nconsider only the mootness of the injunctive claims because Defendants\nare immune from liability for damages. Defendants are immune from\nWalker’s official capacity damages claims under the Eleventh\nAmendment. See Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 64–65\n(1989); Holley v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr., 599 F.3d 1108, 1111–12 (9th Cir.\n2010). Walker’s personal capacity claims fail because Defendants plainly\ndid not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person\nwould (or should) have known, thus entitling Defendants to qualified\nimmunity. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232–33 (2009).\n\f8                        WALKER V. BEARD\n\nasserting his trust account had been mishandled in violation\nof federal law was not moot, even though the prisoner had\nbeen transferred from the prison where the alleged\nmisconduct occurred. 271 F.3d 891, 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2001).\nWe concluded that the claim was not moot because the policy\npursuant to which the alleged violation occurred was “system\nwide” and one of the defendants was in charge of the policy.\nId. at 897; see also Jordan v. Sosa, 654 F.3d 1012, 1028–29\n(10th Cir. 2011); Lehn v. Holmes, 364 F.3d 862, 871–72 (7th\nCir. 2004).\n\n    Reading the complaint in the light most favorable to\nWalker, it challenges his classification as racially eligible\nunder the Housing Policy, which, by its terms, regulates the\nhousing of inmates throughout the California prison system,\nnot just in Walker’s original prison. Defendant Matthew Cate\nwas the head of the California prison system when Walker\nfiled his complaint and was capable of providing relief.4\nThus, Walker has satisfied both of the requirements we\nidentified in Nelson for a transferred prisoner’s claim to avoid\nmootness. Walker remains in State custody, classified as\nracially eligible. His challenge to that classification is not\nmoot.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n    The State next asserts that Walker should be barred from\narguing on appeal that the State improperly burdened his\nability to perform the Odinist warding ritual because: (1) he\nabandoned that argument; and (2) his complaint does not\n\n\n    4\n   Matthew Cate resigned as head of the state prison system in 2012 and\nhis successor has been substituted in his stead with respect to any official\ncapacity claims. See footnote *, supra.\n\f                       WALKER V. BEARD                            9\n\ncontain factual allegations sufficient to support the warding\nritual theory. We discuss these related arguments in turn.\n\n     “It is a general rule that a party cannot revisit theories that\nit raises but abandons at summary judgment.” Ramirez v. City\nof Buena Park, 560 F.3d 1012, 1026 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting\nDavis v. City of Las Vegas, 478 F.3d 1048, 1058 (9th Cir.\n2007) (internal quotation marks omitted)). “A party\nabandons an issue when it has a full and fair opportunity to\nventilate its views with respect to an issue and instead\nchooses a position that removes the issue from the case.” Id.\n(quoting BankAmerica Pension Plan v. McMath, 206 F.3d\n821, 826 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n    The wellspring of our recent abandonment jurisprudence\nis USA Petroleum Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 13 F.3d 1276 (9th\nCir. 1992). Richfield was an antitrust action brought by USA\nPetroleum (“USA”) against its competitor, Atlantic Richfield,\nalleging predatory pricing. Id. at 1277. On appeal, USA\nattempted to rely on a “below-cost pricing” theory of liability\nunder § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, even though it\nhad relied on a different “below-market pricing theory” in the\ndistrict court. Id. at 1279, 1284. We barred USA from\nasserting the new theory on appeal because “USA contended\nthat below-cost pricing was an available predatory pricing\ntheory but expressly chose not to rely upon it” in the lower\ncourt. Id. at 1284.\n\n     Analogizing to Richfield, the State argues that because\nWalker’s complaint did not mention the warding ritual and\ndiscussed only general interference with his religion, Walker\nabandoned the ritual argument. We reject this analogy.\nRichfield and its progeny concerned situations in which a\nlitigant deliberately declined to pursue an argument by taking\n\f10                   WALKER V. BEARD\n\na position that conceded the argument or removed it from the\ncase. See Ramirez, 560 F.3d at 1026; Montero-Martinez v.\nAshcroft, 277 F.3d 1137, 1145 n.9 (9th Cir. 2002); McMath,\n206 F.3d at 826. Here, Walker’s original complaint did not\nmention the ritual, but it also did not allege a set of facts at\nodds with it. Rather, the complaint argued that integrated\ncelling would “violate [Walker’s] religious beliefs and\npractices.” This language suggests that when he filed his\ncomplaint, Walker understood his claim as alleging a\nspectrum of interferences with his religion, including\ninterference with ritual practice. Walker’s subsequent focus\non the warding ritual was not a change of theory, but rather\nan elaboration of his initial argument. Accordingly, Walker\ndid not “choose a position” removing the warding ritual\nargument from the case or conceding it. Id.\n\n    The State next contends that Walker’s complaint does not\nmake out factual allegations sufficient to support his\npreferred legal theory on appeal. The basis of the State’s\nargument is that Walker’s complaint does not actually discuss\nthe warding ritual. According to the State, we must reject\nWalker’s claim and require him file a new complaint that\narticulates how integrated celling interferes with the ritual.\n\n     In general, we “construe liberally motion papers and\npleadings filed by pro se inmates . . . .” Thomas v. Ponder,\n611 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir. 2010). “[I]t is sufficient that\nthe complaint, alone or supplemented by any subsequent\nfilings before summary judgment, provide the defendant fair\nnotice” of the provision under which relief is sought. Alvarez\nv. Hill, 518 F.3d 1152, 1159 (9th Cir. 2008). We expect that\n“[r]esponsive pleadings . . . may be necessary for a pro se\nplaintiff to clarify his legal theories.” Id. at 1158 (quoting\n\f                        WALKER V. BEARD                             11\n\nNeitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 330 n.9 (1989))\n(emendations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Given this liberal standard, we reject the State’s\nargument. Although Walker’s complaint did not mention the\nwarding ritual, it specified the general theory and nucleus of\nfacts under which he sought relief, which was enough to give\nthe State fair notice. See Alvarez, 518 F.3d at 1159.\nWalker’s objection to the F&R, and now his appellate brief,\nsubsequently refined and clarified that broad initial claim. Cf.\nid. at 1158. Walker’s objection to the F&R, which explains\nthe warding ritual and its importance to the Odinist religion,\nis now properly part of the record. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).\nMoreover, the State has not asserted that it suffered any\nprejudice from Walker’s failure to include all of the relevant\nfacts in his initial filing. We thus see no reason to require\nWalker to institute a new action.5\n\n                                  V.\n\n    We now reach to the merits of Walker’s challenge:\nwhether his classification as racially eligible under the\nHousing Policy violates RLUIPA. RLUIPA provides that\n“[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the\nreligious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability,” unless the government demonstrates\nthe burden is “in furtherance of a compelling government\ninterest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\nEnacted after the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the\n\n 5\n   Relatedly, we discuss in Part VII, below, whether Walker should have\nbeen granted leave to amend.\n\f12                   WALKER V. BEARD\n\nReligious Freedom and Restoration Act (“RFRA”), as applied\nto the states, in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997),\nRLUIPA essentially reinstitutes the demanding RFRA\nstandard of review for intrusions on religious liberty in the\nlimited contexts of prisoners and federal land. See Shakur v.\nSchriro, 514 F.3d 878, 888 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n    To state a claim under RLUIPA, a prisoner must show\nthat: (1) he takes part in a “religious exercise,” and (2) the\nState’s actions have substantially burdened that exercise. See\nid. at 888–89. If the prisoner satisfies those elements, then\nthe State must prove its actions were the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering a compelling governmental interest.\nWarsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 2005).\nWe address these elements seriatim.\n\n                              A.\n\n    We first consider whether the warding ritual is a valid\nreligious exercise. RLUIPA defines a religious exercise to\ninclude “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled\nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(7)(A). The definition is intentionally broad. See\nGreene v. Solano Cnty. Jail, 513 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir.\n2008). It covers “not only belief and profession but the\nperformance of . . . physical acts [such as] assembling with\nothers for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental\nuse of bread and wine . . . .” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.\n709, 720 (2005) (quoting Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of\nOr. v. Smith, 494 U.S 872, 877 (1990) (emendations in\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   The warding ritual plainly meets this standard. As a\nphysical act intended to bring about communication with a\n\f                     WALKER V. BEARD                        13\n\ndeity, the warding ritual is a prototypical religious exercise.\nSee Jaffree v. Wallace, 705 F.2d 1526, 1534 (11th Cir. 1983)\n(quoting Karen B. v. Treen, 653 F.2d 897, 901 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(defining prayer as a “quintessential religious practice”)).\nAlthough Odinism is not a mainstream faith, RLUIPA does\nnot, and constitutionally could not, pick favorites among\nreligions. See Lindell v. McCallum, 352 F.3d 1107, 1108,\n1110 (7th Cir. 2003) (concluding that a follower of Odinism\nhad stated a claim under RLUIPA). We conclude that the\nwarding ritual constitutes a religious exercise under RLUIPA.\n\n                              B.\n\n    The next question is whether the State’s classification of\nWalker as racially eligible under the Housing Policy\nsubstantially burdened his practice of Odinism. To constitute\na substantial burden, a limitation of religious practice “must\nimpose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such\nexercise.” San Jose Christian Coll. v. City of Morgan Hill,\n360 F.3d 1024, 1034 (9th Cir. 2004). A substantial burden\nneed not actually force a litigant to change his practices; a\nviolation may occur “where the state . . . denies [an important\nbenefit] because of conduct mandated by religious belief,\nthereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify\nhis behavior and to violate his beliefs.” Warsoldier, 418 F.3d\nat 995 (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp’t Sec.\nDiv., 450 U.S. 707, 717–18 (1981) (emendations in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n    Our holding in Warsoldier is illuminating. In that case,\nthe prisoner-plaintiff, a Native American, refused to conform\nto a prison restriction on hair length on the ground that doing\nso would violate his religious beliefs. Id. at 991–92. After he\nrefused, he was “(1) . . . confined to his cell; (2) had\n\f14                        WALKER V. BEARD\n\nadditional duty hours imposed on him; (3) [was] reclassified\ninto a workgroup where inmates do not receive time credits\nor as many privileges as others working in a higher\nworkgroup; (4) lost his phone call privileges; [and] (5) [was]\nexpelled from print shop and landscaping classes,” among\nother punishments. Id. at 996. Rejecting the argument that\nthe prisoner’s religious practice was not substantially\nburdened because he had not been physically forced to cut his\nhair, we held that the grooming policy constituted a\nsignificant burden because it put “significant pressure” on\nhim to conform. Id.\n\n    Walker’s asserted burden is closely analogous to the one\nat issue in Warsoldier. Like the plaintiff in Warsoldier,\nWalker faced a prison regulation impairing his ability to\nconform to a religious ritual. See Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct.\n853, 862 (2015) (holding that a threat of “serious disciplinary\naction” constituted pressure to conform). Taking Walker at\nhis word, as we must at this stage, a non-white cellmate\nwould make it impossible to perform the warding ritual in his\ncell. As was the case in Warsoldier, Walker accepted prison\ndiscipline rather than the restriction on his religious practice.\nThe punishments he received – a rules violation report and\nplacement in administrative segregation – plainly placed him\nunder pressure to conform. See Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 996.6\n\n\n\n 6\n    The State argues that preventing Walker from performing the warding\nritual in his cell did not substantially burden his religious exercise because\nWalker had alternative means of gaining spiritual fulfillment – namely,\nconducting the ritual outside his cell. We reject this argument because the\nrecord does not disclose whether it is possible for Walker to perform the\nritual outside his personal space, and presuming that would be contrary to\nour obligation to construe pro se § 1983 claims liberally on a motion to\ndismiss. Thomas, 611 F.3d at 1150.\n\f                    WALKER V. BEARD                       15\n\nThus, Walker has shown that his classification as racially\neligible substantially burdens his religious exercise.\n\n                            C.\n\n    Because Walker has shown that the racially eligible\nclassification under the Housing Policy substantially burdens\nhis religious exercise, we must assess whether the State’s\nrefusal to exempt Walker from the Housing Policy’s\nclassification scheme was the least restrictive means of\nfurthering a compelling governmental interest. Our inquiry\nhere is analogous to the application of strict scrutiny. See\nInt’l Church of Foursquare Gospel v. City of San Leandro,\n673 F.3d 1059, 1066 (9th Cir. 2011); Centro Familiar\nCristiano Buenas Nuevas v. City of Yuma, 651 F.3d 1163,\n1171 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\n    At the outset, we note that many possible justifications\nmight exist for the State’s refusal to exempt Walker from\nintegrated celling. See, e.g., Cutter, 544 U.S. at 723 n.11\n(suggesting that a state could have a compelling interest in\n“not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could\nimperil prison security and order”). However, under this\nprong of RLUIPA, the State bears the burden of persuasion.\nWarsoldier, 418 F.3d at 995. We may not rely on an interest\nthe State has failed to articulate. See Guru Nanak Sikh Soc’y\nof Yuba City v. Cnty. of Sutter, 456 F.3d 978, 981 (9th Cir.\n2006); Krislov v. Rednour, 226 F.3d 851, 866 n.7 (7th Cir.\n2000). Here, the State has asserted only a single compelling\ninterest: complying with constitutional restrictions on race-\nconscious action. Thus, we evaluate only that purported\ninterest.\n\f16                       WALKER V. BEARD\n\n     According to the State, subjecting Walker to the\nintegrated celling policy and denying him an exemption is\nnecessary to comply with constitutional restrictions on racial\nsegregation in prisons. The State points us to Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), in which the Supreme Court\nconsidered an equal protection challenge to California’s\nprevious race-conscious celling policy and concluded that\nbecause the policy included express racial classifications,\nstrict scrutiny was required.7 Id. at 508–09. The State\ncontends that exempting Walker from the current policy,\nwhich was developed in response to Johnson, would\nundermine the policy’s efficacy and potentially violate the\nequal protection rights of non-white inmates.\n\n    Compliance with the Constitution can be a compelling\nstate interest. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 275\n(1981) (“We agree that the interest of the [defendant] in\ncomplying with its constitutional obligations may be\ncharacterized as compelling.”).8\n\n   Our precedents, however, are less clear on how certain a\nconstitutional violation must be to justify actions aimed at\navoiding a potential breach. The Supreme Court in Vera\nexplained that compliance with the Voting Rights Act\n\n\n  7\n    Rather than make the determination itself whether California’s then-\nclassification policy passed muster under strict scrutiny, the Court\nremanded for the lower courts to make that determination. See id. at 515.\n 8\n   Adherence to a sub-constitutional restriction also may be compelling.\nSee Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 977 (1996) (assuming without deciding\nthat compliance with the Voting Rights Act may be a compelling interest\njustifying race-conscious state action); see also KDM ex rel. WJM v.\nReedsport School Dist., 196 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding\nthat compliance with a state constitution is a legitimate state interest).\n\f                      WALKER V. BEARD                         17\n\nconstitutes a compelling interest where there is a “strong\nbasis in evidence” that state action is necessary to avoid a\nviolation. Vera, 517 U.S. at 977; see also Ricci v. DeStefano,\n557 U.S. 557, 563 (2009). Most courts to conclude that\ncompliance with the Constitution is a compelling interest\nhave not dwelled on the issue. See, e.g., Lamb’s Chapel v.\nCtr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 395\n(1993); Child Evangelism Fellowship of Minn. v. Minneapolis\nSpecial Sch. Dist. No. 1, 690 F.3d 996, 1002–03 (8th Cir.\n2012).\n\n    We need not determine the exact probability of\nconstitutional harm necessary to give the State a compelling\ninterest in curative action. Here, the State has shown more\nthan merely a good faith belief that exempting Walker would\nbe constitutionally suspect; there is an objectively strong\nlegal basis for believing that is the case. Were the State to\nbegin exempting prisoners from race-neutral celling on the\nbasis of their religious beliefs, its celling system would not be\nrace-neutral. The question would become, under the strict\nscrutiny inquiry mandated by Johnson, whether the State\nwould have a compelling justification for race-conscious\naction. Courts generally accept racial segregation in prisons\nonly when motivated by concerns about prisoner safety. See\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 514; Ochs v. Thalacker, 90 F.3d 293,\n296–97 (8th Cir. 1996); Harris v. Greer, 750 F.2d 617, 619\n(7th Cir. 1984). Although we make no conclusive\ndetermination as to the constitutional effect of racially-based\nexemptions from the Housing Policy, the State has shown a\nsufficient likelihood of liability to give it a compelling\ninterest in refusing Walker’s request for an exemption.\n\n    Because we hold that the State has a compelling interest\nin complying with Johnson, we must also conclude that\n\f18                    WALKER V. BEARD\n\ndenying Walker’s requested exemption was the least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling state interest.\nThe gravamen of Walker’s complaint is that the State’s\nfailure to offer him an exemption from race-neutral celling\nconstitutes a violation of RLUIPA. But granting that\nexemption would be race-conscious action implicating the\nEqual Protection Clause, so the only way to avert potential\nconstitutional liability was to deny the requested exemption.\nAnything else would have introduced a non-race-neutral\nelement into the celling policy, thereby raising the specter of\na credible equal protection claim brought by non-white\nprisoners. There is thus an “exact fit” between the potential\nharm and the challenged state action. Walker v. City of\nMesquite, 169 F.3d 973, 982 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Walker argues that the State fails the least restrictive\nmeans test because it did not “demonstrate[] that it [had]\nactually considered and rejected the efficacy of less\nrestrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.”\nWarsoldier, 418 F.3d at 999. Although the government bears\nthe burden of proof to show its practice is the least-restrictive\nmeans, it is under no obligation to dream up alternatives that\nthe plaintiff himself has not proposed. See United States v.\nWilgus, 638 F.3d 1274, 1289 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that,\nin a least restrictive means inquiry, “the government’s burden\nis two-fold: it must support its choice of regulation, and it\nmust refute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger,\nbut it must do both through the evidence presented in the\nrecord” (emphasis added)).\n\n    Here, Walker has consistently demanded only one form\nof relief: an exemption from the celling policy. As observed\nearlier, this relief would require the State to engage in\nconstitutionally suspect racial divisions of prisoners. Of\n\f                     WALKER V. BEARD                         19\n\ncourse, it is possible to imagine how the State might have\nmaintained its race-neutral celling policy and offered an\naccommodation to Walker – for example, by giving him time\noutside his cell to perform the warding ritual by himself. But\nWalker never asked for such relief, nor has he given any\nindication that he would accept anything short of being\nassigned a white cellmate. The State has no additional\nobligation under RLUIPA independently to research and\npropose every possible way of mitigating that practice’s\nnegative effects. See Vera, 517 U.S. at 977 (“state actors\nshould not be ‘trapped between competing hazards of\nliability’ by the imposition of unattainable requirements\nunder the rubric of strict scrutiny”) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.S. 267, 291 (1986) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). If\nWalker wants time outside his cell to perform the ritual, he\nneeds to ask for it. If the State were to refuse him, that might\nbe the basis for a separate RLUIPA challenge, but it does not\nbear on the challenge here, which is to the application of the\nHousing Policy to him without an exemption.\n\n    We conclude that the State’s actions were the least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling interest. Walker\nhas not stated a claim under RLUIPA.\n\n                              VI.\n\n    Walker also contends that the state’s racially eligible\nclassification infringes on his rights under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. In general, a plaintiff\nwill have stated a free exercise claim if: (1) “the claimant’s\nproffered belief [is] sincerely held”; and (2) “the claim [is]\nrooted in religious belief, not in purely secular philosophical\n\f20                    WALKER V. BEARD\n\nconcerns.” Malik v. Brown, 16 F.3d 330, 333 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although\nprisoners enjoy First Amendment protection, their rights\nunder the Free Exercise Clause are limited by “institutional\nobjectives and by the loss of freedom concomitant with\nincarceration.” Hartmann v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab.,\n707 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2013). To that end, a\nprisoner’s Free Exercise Clause claim will fail if the State\nshows that the challenged action is “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n78, 89 (1987); see Ashelman v. Wawrzaszek, 111 F.3d 674,\n677–78 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n    Walker easily satisfies the threshold requirements for a\nFree Exercise Clause claim because he has alleged a sincerely\nheld religious belief, so his Free Exercise Clause challenge\nthus turns on whether the State’s interest in compliance with\nthe Equal Protection Clause is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\n\n    Potential legal liability may constitute a legitimate\npenological interest under Turner. See Acorn Inv., Inc. v.\nCity of Seattle, 887 F.2d 219, 226 (9th Cir. 1989) (indicating\nthat compliance with an ordinance constitutes a “legitimate\ninterest”); Victoria W. v. Larpenter, 369 F.3d 475, 486 (5th\nCir. 2004) (noting that the threat of legal liability stemming\nfrom prison escapes gave the state a legitimate penological\ninterest in restricting prisoner access to off-site medical care);\ncf. Goodwin v. Turner, 908 F.2d 1395, 1399 n.7 (8th Cir.\n1990) (holding that the state did not have a legitimate\npenological interest stemming from potential legal liability,\nin part, because the grounds for liability were “far-fetched”).\nAs we discuss in Part V.C, there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat exempting Walker from integrated celling would expose\n\f                      WALKER V. BEARD                         21\n\nthe State to liability in an equal protection suit brought by\nother inmates. Liability is not “far fetched.” Goodwin,\n908 F.3d at 1399 n.7.\n\n    The traditional factors we use to weigh prisoners’ Free\nExercise Clause claims also weigh against Walker. In\nTurner, the Supreme Court articulated four factors that bear\non whether a legitimate penological interest exists:\n(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between a\nstate interest and the prison regulation; (2) whether prisoners\nhave an alternative method of engaging in religious practice;\n(3) the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright would have on guards and other inmates; and (4) the\nabsence of ready alternatives to the challenged regulation.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89–90.\n\n    Three of these factors favor the State. First, given the real\nthreat of liability and the high-profile nature of California’s\ncelling procedures post-Johnson, the connection between the\nstate’s interest in avoiding liability and denying Walker’s\nrequested relief is substantial. Second, exempting Odinists\nsuch as Walker from the integrated celling policy but not\nproviding similar exemptions to inmates of other races and\nreligions might exacerbate tensions within California prisons\nand endanger guards. Finally, as discussed in Part V.C, there\nare no alternatives to denying Walker’s request that would\nmitigate the liability concern. We hold that Walker has failed\nto state a claim under the First Amendment.\n\n                              VII.\n\n    Last, Walker contends that he should be granted leave to\namend his complaint. We review a district court’s denial of\nleave to amend for abuse of discretion. Lopez, 203 F.3d at\n\f22                   WALKER V. BEARD\n\n1130. The district court’s discretion on whether to grant\nleave, however, “must be guided by the underlying purpose\nof Rule 15 to facilitate decision on the merits, rather than on\nthe pleadings or technicalities.” United States v. Webb,\n655 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981). A pro se litigant is\nentitled to an opportunity to amend “[u]nless it is absolutely\nclear that no amendment can cure the defect.” Lucas v. Dep’t\nof Corr., 66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend\nbecause no amendment would cure the deficiency in Walker’s\ncomplaint, given his insistence on a wholesale exemption\nfrom the Housing Policy. The threat of equal protection\nliability that requires us to reject Walker’s RLUIPA claim is\nrooted in legal precedent. No facts that Walker could adduce\nwould mitigate the concern. Although Walker might have a\ncolorable RLUIPA claim if the State refused to accommodate\nthe warding ritual by giving him time alone and a place to\nperform it, that claim would be fundamentally different from\nthe one here, i.e., it is not tied to the Housing Policy.\n\n                             VIII.\n\n    Walker successfully alleged a burden on his religious\nexercise under RLUIPA and the First Amendment, but the\nState has a compelling interest in avoiding unconstitutional\nracial discrimination, and subjecting Walker to integrated\ncelling is the only possible means of furthering that interest.\nAccordingly, we conclude that Walker has failed to state\nclaims under RLUIPA and the First Amendment; we further\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying leave to amend.\n\f                 WALKER V. BEARD        23\n\nThe judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\f",

He is an Aryan\nChristian Odinist incarcerated in a California state prison.\nThe Odinist religion forbids adherents from integrating with\nmembers of races other than their own and requires the\nperformance of rituals that may not be conducted in the\npresence of non-“Aryan” individuals. Walker challenges the\nState’s classification of him as eligible to occupy a prison cell\nwith an individual of a different race, alleging that such a\nplacement would interfere with his religious practice. He\nappeals the district court’s ruling that the State’s refusal to\n\f4                       WALKER V. BEARD\n\nexempt him from its Integrated Housing Policy (the “Housing\nPolicy”) did not violate the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§ a2000cc et seq., or the First Amendment. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We conclude that the\nState has a compelling interest in avoiding invidious racial\ndiscrimination and potential liability under the Equal\nProtection Clause, and the only way for the State to satisfy\nthis interest was to reject Walker’s request for an exemption\nfrom the Housing Policy. We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n    According to Walker, Odinism, the religion to which he\nadheres, calls on its followers to preserve the purity of the\nAryan race.1 To that end, Odinists are forbidden from\ninteracting with individuals of other races. Seeking to follow\nhis religious dictates, Walker requested that he be celled with\nan Aryan individual. The state rejected the request. Pursuant\nto the Housing Policy, Walker was classified as “racially\neligible,” allowing the prison to place him in a cell with an\nindividual of a different race.\n\n    The Housing Policy provides for prisoners to be classified\ninto one of five categories, including racially eligible and\n“restricted to own,” meaning ineligible to be placed in a\nmulti-race cell. There is a strong presumption in favor of\nracially eligible status. Under that policy, an inmate’s race\nmay not be a “primary determining factor” in determining his\n\n\n    1\n   Although the word “Aryan” has been variously used to describe Proto-\nIndo-Europeans and Hindus, Walker apparently uses it to refer only to\nwhite individuals of Northern European heritage. We follow that usage\nin this opinion.\n\f                        WALKER V. BEARD                                5\n\nhousing classification. Prison officials may, however,\nconsider certain race-related factors when classifying\ninmates, such as the prisoner’s history of perpetrating or\nbeing victimized by racial violence. A prisoner classified as\nracially eligible who refuses to accept a cellmate of another\nrace is not forced to accept integration, but rather is\ncategorized as “restricted by refusal” and subjected to\ndisciplinary action. Following his classification as racially\neligible, the prison assigned Walker a non-white cellmate and\nWalker refused the assignment. As discipline, the prison\nplaced him in administrative segregation.\n\n    Walker commenced this action pro se against Matthew\nCate, then-Secretary of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation, and Kathleen Dickerson, the\nwarden of the prison in which he was then housed (together\n“Defendants” or the “State”).2 He seeks damages and\ninjunctive relief for a variety of statutory and constitutional\nclaims, including claims under RLUIPA, and the First, Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Although inartfully\ndrafted, the complaint alleges that the State’s classification of\nWalker as racially eligible under the Housing Policy\nimpermissibly abridged his religious liberty by threatening a\nviolation of his “religious beliefs and practices.”\n\n    Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A magistrate judge\nrecommended granting the motion and dismissing all claims.\nStill proceeding pro se, Walker filed objections to the\nmagistrate judge’s findings and recommendations (“F&R”).\n\n\n 2\n   As best as can be determined, Walker appears to have brought claims\nagainst Defendants in both their official and personal capacities, and we\nso construe the complaint.\n\f6                    WALKER V.

Walker\nasserted that as part of his religious practice he engages in a\nritual known as “the spiritual circle of Odinist Warding” (the\n“warding ritual”) to communicate with his gods. Integrated\nhousing, according to Walker, would interfere with this ritual\nbecause the presence of a non-Aryan individual in his cell\nduring the ritual would “pollute” the spiritual circle.\nNotwithstanding Walker’s objections to the F&R, the district\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge’s F&R in full, dismissed\nWalker’s complaint for failure to state a claim, and denied\nleave to amend.\n\n    Now represented by counsel, Walker appeals the\ndismissal of his RLUIPA and First Amendment claims and\nthe denial of leave to amend.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s dismissal for failure\nto state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6).

Richfield was an antitrust action brought by USA\nPetroleum (“USA”) against its competitor, Atlantic Richfield,\nalleging predatory pricing. Id. at 1277. On appeal, USA\nattempted to rely on a “below-cost pricing” theory of liability\nunder § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, even though it\nhad relied on a different “below-market pricing theory” in the\ndistrict court. Id. at 1279, 1284. We barred USA from\nasserting the new theory on appeal because “USA contended\nthat below-cost pricing was an available predatory pricing\ntheory but expressly chose not to rely upon it” in the lower\ncourt. Id. at 1284.\n\n     Analogizing to Richfield, the State argues that because\nWalker’s complaint did not mention the warding ritual and\ndiscussed only general interference with his religion, Walker\nabandoned the ritual argument. We reject this analogy.\nRichfield and its progeny concerned situations in which a\nlitigant deliberately declined to pursue an argument by taking\n\f10                   WALKER V.

Here, Walker’s original complaint did not\nmention the ritual, but it also did not allege a set of facts at\nodds with it. Rather, the complaint argued that integrated\ncelling would “violate [Walker’s] religious beliefs and\npractices.” This language suggests that when he filed his\ncomplaint, Walker understood his claim as alleging a\nspectrum of interferences with his religion, including\ninterference with ritual practice. Walker’s subsequent focus\non the warding ritual was not a change of theory, but rather\nan elaboration of his initial argument. Accordingly, Walker\ndid not “choose a position” removing the warding ritual\nargument from the case or conceding it. Id.\n\n    The State next contends that Walker’s complaint does not\nmake out factual allegations sufficient to support his\npreferred legal theory on appeal. The basis of the State’s\nargument is that Walker’s complaint does not actually discuss\nthe warding ritual.

See Alvarez, 518 F.3d at 1159.\nWalker’s objection to the F&R, and now his appellate brief,\nsubsequently refined and clarified that broad initial claim. Cf.\nid. at 1158. Walker’s objection to the F&R, which explains\nthe warding ritual and its importance to the Odinist religion,\nis now properly part of the record. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).\nMoreover, the State has not asserted that it suffered any\nprejudice from Walker’s failure to include all of the relevant\nfacts in his initial filing.

RLUIPA provides that\n“[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the\nreligious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability,” unless the government demonstrates\nthe burden is “in furtherance of a compelling government\ninterest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\nEnacted after the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the\n\n 5\n   Relatedly, we discuss in Part VII, below, whether Walker should have\nbeen granted leave to amend.\n\f12                   WALKER V.

RLUIPA defines a religious exercise to\ninclude “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled\nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(7)(A). The definition is intentionally broad. See\nGreene v. Solano Cnty.

As a\nphysical act intended to bring about communication with a\n\f                     WALKER V. BEARD                        13\n\ndeity, the warding ritual is a prototypical religious exercise.\nSee Jaffree v.

We conclude that the\nwarding ritual constitutes a religious exercise under RLUIPA.\n\n                              B.\n\n    The next question is whether the State’s classification of\nWalker as racially eligible under the Housing Policy\nsubstantially burdened his practice of Odinism. To constitute\na substantial burden, a limitation of religious practice “must\nimpose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such\nexercise.” San Jose Christian Coll. v. City of Morgan Hill,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785389\"><a href=\"/opinion/785389/san-jose-christian-college-a-california-non-profit-corporation-v-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1034 (9th Cir. 2004). A substantial burden\nneed not actually force a litigant to change his practices; a\nviolation may occur “where the state . . . denies [an important\nbenefit] because of conduct mandated by religious belief,\nthereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify\nhis behavior and to violate his beliefs.” Warsoldier, 418 F.3d\nat 995 (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp’t Sec.\nDiv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717–18 (1981) (emendations in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n    Our holding in Warsoldier is illuminating. In that case,\nthe prisoner-plaintiff, a Native American, refused to conform\nto a prison restriction on hair length on the ground that doing\nso would violate his religious beliefs. Id. at 991–92. After he\nrefused, he was “(1) . . . confined to his cell; (2) had\n\f14                        WALKER V. BEARD\n\nadditional duty hours imposed on him; (3) [was] reclassified\ninto a workgroup where inmates do not receive time credits\nor as many privileges as others working in a higher\nworkgroup; (4) lost his phone call privileges; [and] (5) [was]\nexpelled from print shop and landscaping classes,” among\nother punishments. Id. at 996. Rejecting the argument that\nthe prisoner’s religious practice was not substantially\nburdened because he had not been physically forced to cut his\nhair, we held that the grooming policy constituted a\nsignificant burden because it put “significant pressure” on\nhim to conform. Id.\n\n    Walker’s asserted burden is closely analogous to the one\nat issue in Warsoldier. Like the plaintiff in Warsoldier,\nWalker faced a prison regulation impairing his ability to\nconform to a religious ritual. See Holt v. Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (2015) (holding that a threat of “serious disciplinary\naction” constituted pressure to conform). Taking Walker at\nhis word, as we must at this stage, a non-white cellmate\nwould make it impossible to perform the warding ritual in his\ncell. As was the case in Warsoldier, Walker accepted prison\ndiscipline rather than the restriction on his religious practice.\nThe punishments he received – a rules violation report and\nplacement in administrative segregation – plainly placed him\nunder pressure to conform. See Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 996.6\n\n\n\n 6\n    The State argues that preventing Walker from performing the warding\nritual in his cell did not substantially burden his religious exercise because\nWalker had alternative means of gaining spiritual fulfillment – namely,\nconducting the ritual outside his cell. We reject this argument because the\nrecord does not disclose whether it is possible for Walker to perform the\nritual outside his personal space, and presuming that would be contrary to\nour obligation to construe pro se § 1983 claims liberally on a motion to\ndismiss.

The State\ncontends that exempting Walker from the current policy,\nwhich was developed in response to Johnson, would\nundermine the policy’s efficacy and potentially violate the\nequal protection rights of non-white inmates.\n\n    Compliance with the Constitution can be a compelling\nstate interest.

Here, the State has shown more\nthan merely a good faith belief that exempting Walker would\nbe constitutionally suspect; there is an objectively strong\nlegal basis for believing that is the case. Were the State to\nbegin exempting prisoners from race-neutral celling on the\nbasis of their religious beliefs, its celling system would not be\nrace-neutral. The question would become, under the strict\nscrutiny inquiry mandated by Johnson, whether the State\nwould have a compelling justification for race-conscious\naction. Courts generally accept racial segregation in prisons\nonly when motivated by concerns about prisoner safety. See\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 514; Ochs v. Thalacker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722464\"><a href=\"/opinion/722464/donald-duane-ochs-v-john-a-thalacker-warden-iowa-mens-reformatory-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n296–97 (8th Cir. 1996); Harris v.

Although we make no conclusive\ndetermination as to the constitutional effect of racially-based\nexemptions from the Housing Policy, the State has shown a\nsufficient likelihood of liability to give it a compelling\ninterest in refusing Walker’s request for an exemption.\n\n    Because we hold that the State has a compelling interest\nin complying with Johnson, we must also conclude that\n\f18                    WALKER V. BEARD\n\ndenying Walker’s requested exemption was the least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling state interest.\nThe gravamen of Walker’s complaint is that the State’s\nfailure to offer him an exemption from race-neutral celling\nconstitutes a violation of RLUIPA. But granting that\nexemption would be race-conscious action implicating the\nEqual Protection Clause, so the only way to avert potential\nconstitutional liability was to deny the requested exemption.\nAnything else would have introduced a non-race-neutral\nelement into the celling policy, thereby raising the specter of\na credible equal protection claim brought by non-white\nprisoners. There is thus an “exact fit” between the potential\nharm and the challenged state action. Walker v. City of\nMesquite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762208\"><a href=\"/opinion/762208/debra-walker-debra-walker-jeanette-washington-hazel-williams-zelma-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 982 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Walker argues that the State fails the least restrictive\nmeans test because it did not “demonstrate[] that it [had]\nactually considered and rejected the efficacy of less\nrestrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.”\nWarsoldier, 418 F.3d at 999. Although the government bears\nthe burden of proof to show its practice is the least-restrictive\nmeans, it is under no obligation to dream up alternatives that\nthe plaintiff himself has not proposed. See United States v.\nWilgus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213533\"><a href=\"/opinion/213533/united-states-v-wilgus/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that,\nin a least restrictive means inquiry, “the government’s burden\nis two-fold: it must support its choice of regulation, and it\nmust refute the alternative schemes offered by the challenger,\nbut it must do both through the evidence presented in the\nrecord” (emphasis added)).\n\n    Here, Walker has consistently demanded only one form\nof relief: an exemption from the celling policy. As observed\nearlier, this relief would require the State to engage in\nconstitutionally suspect racial divisions of prisoners. Of\n\f                     WALKER V. BEARD                         19\n\ncourse, it is possible to imagine how the State might have\nmaintained its race-neutral celling policy and offered an\naccommodation to Walker – for example, by giving him time\noutside his cell to perform the warding ritual by himself. But\nWalker never asked for such relief, nor has he given any\nindication that he would accept anything short of being\nassigned a white cellmate. The State has no additional\nobligation under RLUIPA independently to research and\npropose every possible way of mitigating that practice’s\nnegative effects. See Vera, 517 U.S. at 977 (“state actors\nshould not be ‘trapped between competing hazards of\nliability’ by the imposition of unattainable requirements\nunder the rubric of strict scrutiny”) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (1986) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). If\nWalker wants time outside his cell to perform the ritual, he\nneeds to ask for it. If the State were to refuse him, that might\nbe the basis for a separate RLUIPA challenge, but it does not\nbear on the challenge here, which is to the application of the\nHousing Policy to him without an exemption.\n\n    We conclude that the State’s actions were the least\nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling interest. Walker\nhas not stated a claim under RLUIPA.\n\n                              VI.\n\n    Walker also contends that the state’s racially eligible\nclassification infringes on his rights under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. In general, a plaintiff\nwill have stated a free exercise claim if: (1) “the claimant’s\nproffered belief [is] sincerely held”; and (2) “the claim [is]\nrooted in religious belief, not in purely secular philosophical\n\f20                    WALKER V.

To that end, a\nprisoner’s Free Exercise Clause claim will fail if the State\nshows that the challenged action is “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987); see Ashelman v.

BEARD                         21\n\nthe State to liability in an equal protection suit brought by\nother inmates. Liability is not “far fetched.” Goodwin,\n908 F.3d at 1399 n.7.\n\n    The traditional factors we use to weigh prisoners’ Free\nExercise Clause claims also weigh against Walker. In\nTurner, the Supreme Court articulated four factors that bear\non whether a legitimate penological interest exists:\n(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between a\nstate interest and the prison regulation; (2) whether prisoners\nhave an alternative method of engaging in religious practice;\n(3) the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright would have on guards and other inmates; and (4) the\nabsence of ready alternatives to the challenged regulation.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89–90.\n\n    Three of these factors favor the State. First, given the real\nthreat of liability and the high-profile nature of California’s\ncelling procedures post-Johnson, the connection between the\nstate’s interest in avoiding liability and denying Walker’s\nrequested relief is substantial. Second, exempting Odinists\nsuch as Walker from the integrated celling policy but not\nproviding similar exemptions to inmates of other races and\nreligions might exacerbate tensions within California prisons\nand endanger guards. Finally, as discussed in Part V.C, there\nare no alternatives to denying Walker’s request that would\nmitigate the liability concern. We hold that Walker has failed\nto state a claim under the First Amendment.\n\n                              VII.\n\n    Last, Walker contends that he should be granted leave to\namend his complaint. We review a district court’s denial of\nleave to amend for abuse of discretion. Lopez, 203 F.3d at\n\f22                   WALKER V. BEARD\n\n1130. The district court’s discretion on whether to grant\nleave, however, “must be guided by the underlying purpose\nof Rule 15 to facilitate decision on the merits, rather than on\nthe pleadings or technicalities.” United States v.

A pro se litigant is\nentitled to an opportunity to amend “[u]nless it is absolutely\nclear that no amendment can cure the defect.” Lucas v. Dep’t\nof Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704080\"><a href=\"/opinion/704080/webster-salasker-lucas-v-department-of-corrections-california-mens/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend\nbecause no amendment would cure the deficiency in Walker’s\ncomplaint, given his insistence on a wholesale exemption\nfrom the Housing Policy. The threat of equal protection\nliability that requires us to reject Walker’s RLUIPA claim is\nrooted in legal precedent. No facts that Walker could adduce\nwould mitigate the concern. Although Walker might have a\ncolorable RLUIPA claim if the State refused to accommodate\nthe warding ritual by giving him time alone and a place to\nperform it, that claim would be fundamentally different from\nthe one here, i.e., it is not tied to the Housing Policy.\n\n                             VIII.\n\n    Walker successfully alleged a burden on his religious\nexercise under RLUIPA and the First Amendment, but the\nState has a compelling interest in avoiding unconstitutional\nracial discrimination, and subjecting Walker to integrated\ncelling is the only possible means of furthering that interest.\nAccordingly, we conclude that Walker has failed to state\nclaims under RLUIPA and the First Amendment; we further\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying leave to amend.\n\f                 WALKER V. BEARD        23\n\nThe judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
