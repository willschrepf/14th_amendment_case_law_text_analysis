Gettleman, Judge.\n\nArgued September 25, 2001 and February 15, 2002--\nDecided May 13, 2002\n\n\n  Before Rovner, Diane P. Wood, and Evans,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n  Diane P. Wood, Circuit Judge. In these\ntwo cases, which we have consolidated\nsolely for the purpose of issuing our\nopinion, certain parties are seeking to\nenjoin the Illinois State Board of\nEducation (ISBE) from promulgating and\nimplementing new rules on special\neducation teacher certification. The Reid\nL. parties are minor children enrolled in\nIllinois public schools outside of\nChicago; they all have been classified by\ntheir respective school districts as\n\fhaving disabilities, within the meaning\nof the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. sec. 1400\net seq. The Corey H. parties are their\ncounterparts within the City of Chicago.\n\n  After a great deal of litigation, which\nwe describe below, the district court\nentered a remedial decree designed to\nbring the Illinois system of special\neducation teacher certification into\ncompliance with various requirements of\nthe IDEA, particularly its directive that\nstudents be educated in the least\nrestrictive environment, see 20 U.S.C.\nsec. 1412(a)(5). The two appeals before\nus represent the efforts of the Reid L.\nparties to prevent the new rules\ndeveloped pursuant to the district\ncourt’s order from entering into effect\n(or, if necessary, to roll them back).\nThe Reid L. appeal (No. 01-2707) arises\nfrom the district court’s denial of a\npreliminary injunction that would have\nstopped the rules from going into effect\non July 1, 2001. The Reid L. parties and\ncertain teachers also tried to intervene\ndirectly in the Corey H. litigation; the\nCorey H. appeal (No. 01-3432) is brought\nby the would-be intervenors to challenge\nthe denial of their motions to intervene.\nWe conclude that the district court did\nnot err either in refusing to enjoin the\nnew rules or in denying the Reid L.\nparties’ attempt to intervene in the\nCorey H. case; we therefore affirm.\n\nI\n\n  In order to place the present dispute in\ncontext, we must look back a quarter of a\ncentury to the way in which children with\ndisabilities have received their\neducation in the Chicago Public Schools.\nIn 1975, Congress passed the Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act, Pub. L.\n94-142 (Nov. 29, 1975), which for the\nfirst time required that children with\ndisabilities be educated with the least\nrestrictive accommodations possible. In\n1990, Congress replaced that statute with\nthe IDEA. In the meantime, however,\nChicago had done little to change the way\nin which it handled the education of the\naffected students. Briefly put, it relied\nheavily on categorization of both\nstudents and teachers, and had little\nflexibility for cross-categorical or\nindividualized arrangements.\n\f  On May 22, 1992, the Corey H. plaintiffs\nand their parents, acting on behalf of\nthemselves and all similarly situated\ndisabled students attending the Chicago\nPublic Schools (CPS), filed an action in\nfederal court against the Board of\nEducation of the City of Chicago, the\nSuperintendent of the Board, and the\nIllinois State Board of Education,\nclaiming that the defendants had failed\nto provide students with disabilities who\nattended the CPS with a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive\nenvironment, as mandated by the IDEA,\nsec.sec. 1412(a)(1) and (5). The Chicago\nBoard and the ISBE opposed class\ncertification, but the district court\ndisagreed and certified the Corey H.\nclass on February 1, 1993, at the same\ntime denying the defendants’ motion to\ndismiss.\n\n  Four years later, on February 10, 1997,\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs filed a second\namended complaint, in which they alleged\nthat the ISBE violated the IDEA by\nfailing to ensure that an adequate supply\nof qualified special education teachers\nand related personnel was available and\nproperly trained. On July 29, 1997, joint\nexperts hired by all the parties in Corey\nH. issued a report. Their report\nconcluded that the current certification\nsystem for special education teachers was\nin part responsible for the failures in\nthe education of the affected children.\nThat system employed eight disability\ncategories: learning disabilities,\nsocial/emotional disorders, educable\nmentally handicapped, trainable mentally\nhandicapped, physically handicapped,\nblind/visually impaired, deaf/hard of\nhearing, and speech/ language\nhandicapped. The report described this\nsystem as \"archaic\" and asserted that\n\"the current certification system results\nin categorical service delivery, limits\nthe way staff can be used and limits\ninvolvement in general education. . . .\"\nThe experts reported also that the\ncertification system improperly supported\nthe segregation of students with\ndisabilities according to their\ndisability category and unlawfully\nlimited the educational environment in\nwhich they were placed.\n\n  In September 1997, the Corey H.\nplaintiffs and the Chicago Board reached\na settlement, which the district court\n\fpreliminarily approved on October 23,\n1997. The district court ordered the\nparties to provide notice of the\nsettlement, and it then held a fairness\nhearing on January 16, 1998. That\nsettlement was finally approved on that\nday, and its terms are not part of the\npresent controversy.\n\n  What continued after that settlement was\nthe question of the ISBE’s liability. As\nto that part of the case, the Corey H.\nparties and the ISBE proceeded to trial\non October 20, 1997. See Corey H. v.\nBoard of Education of the City of\nChicago, 995 F. Supp. 900, 903 (N.D. Ill.\n1998). On February 19, 1998, the district\ncourt found in favor of the plaintiffs on\nthe liability question, holding that the\nISBE had violated the least restrictive\nenvironment mandate of the IDEA. Id. The\ncourt’s findings specifically singled out\nthe categorical system of special\neducation teacher certification as a\ncontributing factor to the violation.\nAccordingly, the court ordered the ISBE\nto develop rules and regulations for\nteacher certification that would bring\nthe state into compliance with the\nstatute.\n\n  Rather than appealing the liability\ndecision, the ISBE and the plaintiff\nparties entered into settlement\ndiscussions with respect to remedies.\nTheir efforts bore fruit a year later,\nand on March 24, 1999, the district court\npreliminarily approved the proposed\nsettlement, and ordered notice and a\npublic hearing which was scheduled for\nJune 18, 1999. The notice was\ndisseminated widely throughout both\nChicago and the state; it elicited\nhundreds of written comments on the\nsettlement. Importantly, people from\nthroughout the State of Illinois\nresponded, many with objections. Among\nthe responders was the Illinois Education\nAssociation (IEA), the principal\nteachers’ organization in Illinois, which\nsubmitted a letter through its president,\nBob Haisman.\n\n  Although the Corey H. litigation\nconcerned only the Chicago public\nschools, it was obvious that the teacher\ncertification issue would affect the\nentire state. Illinois has long since\ndone away with separate teacher\ncertification standards for Chicago and\n\fthe rest of the state, and thus to fix\nmatters for Chicago inevitably meant a\nchange in statewide standards. See 105\nILCS 5/14-9.01 (\"No person shall be\nemployed to teach any class or program\nauthorized by this Article [Children with\nDisabilities] . . . unless he has had\nsuch special training as the State Board\nof Education may require.\"). At the start\nof the hearing, in fact, the district\ncourt advised the participants that if\nthey had wished to have a more formal\nvoice in the content of the settlement\nagreement, they should have moved earlier\neither to intervene or to submit a brief\namicus curiae. Nevertheless, there was\nextensive testimony from interested\nparties.\n\n On the same day that the fairness\nhearing was held, June 18, 1999, the\ndistrict court entered an order approving\nthe settlement between the Corey H.\nplaintiffs and the ISBE. The settlement\nagreement covered a number of topics, in\ncluding monitoring procedures and\npolicies, pre-school services, funding\npolicies, and, central for present\npurposes, teacher certification. Instead\nof having the court draft the detailed\nremedial plan, the parties agreed that\nISBE would have the primary\nresponsibility to develop special\neducation teacher certification rules, in\ncooperation with the CBE and the\nplaintiffs. Any such rules were subject\nto the court’s retained jurisdiction to\nensure that any plan eventually adopted\nwas consistent with the permanent\ninjunction the court had already entered\nagainst ISBE forbidding further\nviolations of the IDEA. See Corey H., 995\nF. Supp. at 918.\n\n  The ISBE set out to do just that. Even\nbefore the settlement agreement had been\napproved, in 1998, the ISBE began working\nwith Illinois parents, advocates for\nstudents with disabilities, and\neducators, to revamp these teacher\ncertification rules. It created two\nadvisory panels, which conducted a dozen\npublic statewide hearings on the issue.\nThe panels also sent proposed\ncertification standards to numerous\noutsiders, including teachers,\nuniversities, and professional\nassociations, for their comments. In\nOctober 1999, the panels submitted their\nreport to the ISBE, recommending that the\n\fexisting eight categories be reduced to\nfive. Because opinions still conflicted\nso strongly on the best way to achieve\nthe goals of the IDEA, however, the ISBE\nthen convened another Blue Ribbon Task\nForce, which met in February 2000 to\ndevelop recommendations for certification\nof special education teachers. That task\nforce suggested combining the five\ncategorical certificates (learning\ndisability, social/emotional disorder,\neducable mentally handicapped, trainable\nmentally handicapped, and physically\nhandicapped) into two new certificates--\none for Learning Behavior Specialist\nAdapted Curriculum Focus, and the other\nfor Learning Behavior Specialist Modified\nCurriculum Focus. In addition to these\ntwo recommendations, the IEA and the\nIllinois Special Education Coalition\nsubmitted a proposal recommending\nretention of the eight categorical\ncertificates and adding a new cross-\ncategorical certificate.\n  At this point, the ISBE realized that it\nwas decision time. The diversity of views\nthat were before it made it clear that\nthe Board was not likely to find a\nconsensus solution that made everyone\nhappy. In coming up with its final\nproposal, it took a number of factors\ninto account, including the fact that\nmany students’ disabilities touch several\nof the old categories, the need to train\nteachers properly for any new system that\nwas implemented, the impact of any new\nsystem on the supply of special education\nteachers, the impact of any new system on\nthe ability of local school districts to\ndeliver services to disabled students,\nthe length of time needed to implement\nany new system, and the effect of a new\nsystem on existing teachers. The ISBE\nstaff accordingly developed its own\noption, which contemplated one\ncertificate (\"Learning Behavior\nSpecialist 1\", or LBS1) for all the\nformer categorical certificates (learning\ndisability, etc., as mentioned above),\nand separate certification for\nspecialists in teaching students who have\nvision impairments, hearing impairments,\nor early childhood or speech/language\ndisorder. This was the proposal the ISBE\nsubmitted for the approval of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  The court had appointed a Monitor to\nassist it in overseeing both the Chicago\nBoard’s and the ISBE’s compliance with\n\ftheir respective settlement agreements.\nThe Monitor accordingly submitted\ncomments on the ISBE’s proposed\ncertification rules on June 22, 2000. In\nthose comments, the Monitor suggested\nthat the certification rules should be\nsubmitted as peremptory rules to the\nJoint Committee on Administrative Rules\n(JCAR) in the Illinois General Assembly\n(a legislative support services agency\ncreated under Illinois law, see 5 ILCS\n100/5-90). See also 5 ILCS 100/5-50\n(describing peremptory rulemaking). On\nSeptember 12, 2000, the district court\naccepted the Monitor’s recommendation and\nordered the ISBE to file its proposed\ncertification rules as peremptory rules\nunder the Illinois Administrative\nProcedure Act. It concluded that this was\nproper because these rules were \"required\nas a result of federal law, federal rules\nand regulations, [or] an order of a\ncourt,\" see 5 ILCS 100/5-50, not as a\n\"consent order or other court order[ ]\nadopting settlements negotiated by the\nagency,\" see id. ISBE never would have\ntaken action had it not been for the\ncourt’s February 1998 decision on\nliability and the remedial order that\nfollowed.\n\n  On October 26, 2000, the ISBE published\nthe certification rules under its\nperemptory rulemaking authority. The\nrules identify specific common standards\nthat all special education teachers must\nmaster, as well as standards for those\nwho want the LBS1 certificate. At that\npoint, however, a tug-of-war at the state\nlevel emerged. In January 2001, JCAR\nsuspended the rules, claiming that they\nconstituted a serious threat to the\npublic interest and welfare. The district\ncourt judge then met with the Corey H.\nparties and certain members of the\nIllinois General Assembly to decide what\nto do. These efforts at consensus also\nfailed, however; on February 21, 2001,\nJCAR again announced that the rules were\nsuspended. On February 27, 2001,\nexercising the power to act independently\nof the ISBE altogether that it had\nreserved in both the ruling on liability\nand in the settlement agreement, the\ncourt ordered the ISBE to implement the\nrules immediately without referral to\nJCAR. The Illinois 92nd General Assembly\nalso attempted to stop the implementation\nof the rules, voting to continue\nindefinitely the suspension of the rules\n\fand passing a joint resolution of both\nhouses on May 31, 2001.\n\n  At the same time, the court ordered the\nISBE to conduct public hearings on\nanother set of rules, the Rules for Tran\nsition to the New Special Education\nCertification Structure (transition\nrules). The transition rules outlined the\nprocedure for teachers holding\ncertificates under the old system to\nbecome requalified as holders of the LBS1\ncertificate. Essentially, they created a\nthree-year grace period for such\nteachers, giving them time to acquire any\nadditional training they might need.\nDuring that interim period, no Illinois\nschool district would be permitted to\nassign a transitional teacher to teach\nstudents outside his or her prior\ncategorical certificate. As ordered by\nthe court, the ISBE held public hearings\non the transition rules in March 2001. It\nreceived extensive comments. As a result\nof those comments, ISBE proposed\nsplitting the LBS1 certificate into two\n(general curriculum and differentiated\ncurriculum), but the district court\nrefused to do so.\n\n  On June 28, 2001, the court ordered the\nISBE to implement the transition rules.\nWe now turn back to the parties who are\nattempting to challenge these results\nfrom the Corey H. case: the plaintiffs in\nthe Reid L. litigation (who are also the\nproposed intervenors in the Corey H.\ncase, which allows us to refer to them\nsimply as the Reid L. parties). On May 7,\n2000, the Reid L. parties (a group\nofspecial education teachers and students\nwho live outside the boundaries of the\nChicago Public School district, and are\nhence nonmembers of the Corey H. class)\nfiled a motion to intervene in the Corey\nH. litigation. Their motion alleged that\nthe ISBE had violated the IDEA, the 11th\nand 14th Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution, and the Illinois\nAdministrative Procedure Act when it\npromulgated both the certification rules\nand the transition rules. On August 15,\n2001, the district court denied the Reid\nL. students’ motion to intervene; on\nAugust 30, 2001, it denied the Reid L.\nteachers’ motion to intervene. Appeal No.\n01-3432 is from those orders of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  Meanwhile, on June 4, 2001, the Reid L.\n\fparties filed a separate action for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief (No. 01\nC 4180 in the district court). The\ncomplaint in the injunction action\ncontained exactly the same allegations as\nthe motion to intervene. The district\ncourt denied the Reid L. parties’ request\nfor a preliminary injunction and a tempo\nrary restraining order on June 28, 2001;\nAppeal No. 01-2707 in this court concerns\nthat order. We consider first the Reid L.\nparties’ arguments with respect to their\nmotions to intervene; we then turn to\ntheir effort to obtain injunctive relief.\n\nII\n\n  In remarks delivered in open court, the\ndistrict court gave several reasons for\ndenying the motions to intervene, either\nof right or permissively. First, he found\nthat the Reid L. parties filed their\nmotion too late: \"the individual named\nintervenors . . . knew about the case for\na long time. The case has been\nextensively publicized throughout the\nstate. I can certainly take notice of\nthat, because it all came out in the\nfairness hearing back in June of 1999,\nmore than two years ago.\" Timing alone,\nthe district court found, was \"enough to\ndeny the motion.\" In that connection, the\ncourt also noted the active role that the\nIEA was playing in the Reid L. effort and\ncommented that had they tried to\nintervene back before all the work was\ndone, they would have had a better\nargument. The court expressed concern for\nthe finality of its order and found that\nto allow the proposed intervention would\nunravel results that had been reached\nsince February of 1998, the date of its\noriginal decision on liability and its\ngeneral injunction against the ISBE. At\nthat early date, the court had identified\nthe need for cross-categorical\ncertification of special education\nteachers in order to comply with the IDEA\nand its \"least restrictive environment\"\nmandate.\n\n  In addition to these central concerns,\nthe court also indicated that it did not\nbelieve that the proposed intervenors had\nshown that they had standing to sue, in\nthat they were asserting only a\ngeneralized interest in a sound\neducational system. Next, it stated that\nthe intervenors had failed to demonstrate\nthat their interests had not been\n\fadequately represented by an existing\nparty, namely, the ISBE (which, the court\nnoted, had opposed the Corey H.\nplaintiffs on the liability merits, and\nthen opposed them at the remedies stage\nfor a long time). Finally, the court\nfound that the intervenors had failed to\nshow that their rights or interests would\nbe impaired by anything in the Corey H.\nsettlement. Placement decisions for\nstudents would continue to be made on a\nchild-by-child basis, pursuant to each\nchild’s individual education plan; and\nteachers had no interest in refusing to\ntailor their continuing educational\ntraining to the requirements of the new\nsystem, which ensured that no one would\nbe decertified.\n\n\n  A.   Intervention of Right\n\n  There are four requirements for\nintervention of right under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n24(a), in the absence of a statute giving\nan absolute right to intervene: (1)\ntimeliness, (2) an interest relating to\nthe subject matter of the main action,\n(3) at least potential impairment of that\ninterest if the action is resolved\nwithout the intervenor, and (4) lack of\nadequate representation by existing\nparties. See Commodity Futures Trading\nComm’n v. Heritage Capital Advisory\nServs., Ltd., 736 F.2d 384, 386 (7th Cir.\n1984). The burden is on the party seeking\nto intervene of right to show that all\nfour criteria are met. Keith v. Daley,\n764 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir. 1985). If\nnot, then the district court must deny\nintervention of right. See United States\nv. 36.96 Acres of Land, 754 F.2d 855, 858\n(7th Cir. 1985).\n\n  Here, the principal ground on which the\ndistrict court relied to deny the motion\nis expressly recognized by the Rule:\ntimeliness. As it had long since entered\nits decree, the court relied on People\nWho Care v. Rockford Bd. of Ed., 68 F.3d\n172 (7th Cir. 1995), to find that the\npresumption against intervention at that\nlate date was sufficiently strong to\ndefeat the effort of the Reid L. parties\nto do so. The Reid L. parties take\nexception to the court’s characterization\nof them as latecomers to the event. They\ninsist that they acted as soon as they\nrealized that the certification rules\nwere indeed going to be applied on a\n\fstate-wide basis and that the legislature\nwould not be able to protect their\ninterests. They point to February 17,\n2001, as the critical date, because it\nwas then that the district court ruled\nthat the Illinois General Assembly could\nnot nullify its remedial order. They also\npoint out that the rules had not yet been\nimplemented at the time of their\nintervention motion.\n\n  We see no flaw in the district court’s\nconclusion that the Reid L. parties\nwaited too long before attempting to\nintervene. Timeliness is fundamental not\nonly to intervention, but to the overall\nconduct of a lawsuit, and it is a clearly\nspelled out requirement of Rule 24. \"The\npurpose of the [timeliness] requirement\nis to prevent a tardy intervenor from\nderailing a lawsuit within sight of the\nterminal.\" Sokaogon Chippewa Community v.\nBabbitt, 214 F.3d 941, 949 (7th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotations omitted). In\norder to decide whether a motion to\nintervene was timely, we look at factors\nlike (1) the length of time the\nintervenor knew or should have known of\nher interest in the case, (2) the\nprejudice caused to the original parties\nby the delay, (3) the prejudice to the\nintervenor if the motion is denied, and\n(4) any other unusual circumstances.\nRagsdale v. Turnock, 941 F.2d 501, 504\n(7th Cir. 1991).\n\n  These motions were filed nine years\nafter the Corey H. litigation began; more\nthan two years after the district court’s\nopinion finding the ISBE liable and\nsingling out the state-wide teacher\ncertification standards as a particular\nviolation of the least restrictive\nenvironment rules; and more than ten\nmonths after the court approved the\nsettlement agreement that formed the\nbasis for the work leading up to the\ncertification rules and the transition\nrules. These events provided ample notice\nto the Reid L. parties that their\ninterests might be implicated in the\nISBE’s response to the court’s orders. To\nthe extent that they are arguing that the\nstandard requires that their interests\nhave been impaired beyond any remedy,\nthey are wrong. Indeed, just as we\nrejected this kind of argument in\nSokaogon Chippewa, we reject it here. See\n214 F.3d at 949. The time to intervene\nwas, at the very latest, when the\n\fremedial process began, ten months before\nthe actual motion. That was when the\nrules were being drafted and publicly\ndiscussed; that was when their input\ncould have been received without undoing\nthe long and difficult process that all\nother parties to this litigation had been\npursuing in good faith. Even if we were\nto consider the ten months to be the only\nrelevant delay, we could find no error in\nthe district court’s determination, as a\ndecision about timeliness is reviewed for\nabuse of discretion. Vollmer v.\nPublishers Clearing House, 248 F.3d 698,\n705-06 (7th Cir. 2001). The Supreme Court\nin N.A.A.C.P. v. New York, 413 U.S. 345\n(1973) found that even a 17-day delay\nmade the motion untimely as \"it was\nincumbent upon the appellants, at that\nstage of the proceedings, (a critical\nstage) to take immediate affirmative\nsteps to protect their interests.\" 413\nU.S. at 367.\n\n  The district court’s conclusion that the\nother parties to the litigation would\nsuffer prejudice if the Reid L. parties\nwere entitled to intervene is also well\nsupported on this record. This case is\nclose to completion, after a decade of\nlitigation in the federal courts. If the\nReid L. parties were allowed to enter\nnow, everyone would be forced to return\nto Square One, with the same old\ncertification rules in place, the same\nold problems under the IDEA, and no\nremedy in sight. The district court\ncorrectly noted that our decision in\nPeople Who Care strongly discourages such\neleventh-hour measures. See also United\nStates v. South Bend Community School\nCorp., 710 F.2d 394, 396 (7th Cir. 1983).\nThis is true notwithstanding the fact\nthat the Reid L. parties will be\ndisadvantaged to the extent that they\nwill have lost the chance to urge ISBE to\nimplement a system more like the old one\nthey are losing. But any such loss is of\ntheir own making; it is perfectly clear\nthat they knew about this litigation and\nwere content to participate on the\nsidelines for a long period of time.\nTheirs is not the kind of prejudice that\nshould weigh in favor of a long-delayed\nmotion for intervention. Since there are\nno other unusual circumstances counseling\nin favor of intervention, we conclude\nthat the district court was justified in\ndenying the motion on the ground of\nuntimeliness.\n\f  Even assuming that untimeliness was not\nenough to bar the claim, intervention as\nof right would still not be appropriate.\nThe Reid L. parties argue that they have\nasserted the kind of substantial interest\nin the new certification rules that would\njustify intervention, claiming that their\ninterest is exactly the same as that of\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs themselves: an\ninterest in the most effective system for\nteaching children with disabilities\nconsistent with the IDEA. At that level\nof generality, of course, they are\ncorrect. But the new element the teacher-\nintervenors seek to introduce into the\ncase is more parochial: they wish to urge\nthat the new rules will force them to\nchange in ways that they regard as\nundesirable. The non-Chicago students\namong the Reid L. group wish only to\nargue that a different solution to the\nproven violation would have been\npreferable. The teachers’ interest is far\nafield from the core concerns of the\nIDEA, which as we have already said are\nto assure the best appropriate education\nfor students with disabilities in the\nleast restrictive environment. As for the\nstudents, while they may have had a valid\ninterest while the new rules were being\ndrafted, now that the rules have been\nembodied in a decree the picture is\ndifferent. Once the new rules are\nimplemented, the violation of the IDEA\nshould be redressed. At that point, the\nReid L. students have merely a\ndisagreement about pedagogical theory\nwith the Corey H. plaintiffs. Such a\nvague concern is not enough to support\nintervention of right. Thus, at either a\nhigh or low level of generality, the Reid\nL. students’ claim for intervention\nfails: if it is a general interest in\nIllinois’s compliance with the IDEA, that\nis taken care of by all the parties in\nthe Corey H. litigation already; if they\nare concerned only with the specifics of\nthe new certification rules, they have no\nindependent interest in the details of\ntheir teachers’ certification, once the\nremedial order brings such certification\nin compliance with federal law.\n\n  We also see no independent interest the\nReid L. intervenors can assert in the\nspecific procedures that were used to\ndevelop the new rules; it is plain on the\nface of this record that extensive\nnotice, opportunity to comment, and\n\freview were involved, and we see nothing\nin the IDEA that requires more.\n\n  Next, we agree with the district court\nthat the Reid L. students have not shown\nhow their interest in the least\nrestrictive educational environment has\nbeen impaired by the new rules. As the\ncourt noted, each pupil will still be en\ntitled to have an individualized\neducation plan developed for him or her;\nschool districts will continue to have an\nobligation to provide qualified personnel\nto teach those students (or to place them\nelsewhere if that cannot be done); and\nstudents will still be able to take\nadvantage of the procedural protections\nafforded by the statute if they or their\nparents believe that the program is\nfalling short.\n\n  Finally, we consider whether the\ndistrict court correctly found that the\nlegally cognizable interests of the Reid\nL. proposed intervenors were adequately\nrepresented by the existing parties to\nthe case. See People Who Care, 68 F.3d at\n177. Insofar as the students had an\ninterest in proving a violation of the\nfederal statute, it is clear that the\nCorey H. parties represented them very\nwell--so much so that a major problem of\nnoncompliance with federal law has been\nredressed. Insofar as the students had an\ninterest in having the court adopt an\neffective remedy for that violation--\nanother thing that was accomplished--it\nis also true that numerous points of view\nwere aired before ISBE and the court\nsettled on the final remedial measures.\nThe mere fact that no student from\ndownstate Illinois was formally entitled\nto party status does not mean that the\ncourt was unexposed to arguments about\nthe virtues of more categorical\ncertification standards, or fewer such\nstandards. As the district court pointed\nout, for much of this litigation ISBE, a\ngovernmental body, was opposing the Corey\nH. plaintiffs in much the same way one\nwould have expected the Reid L. proposed\nintervenors to behave. See generally\nUnited States v. South Bend Community\nSchool Corp., 692 F.2d 623, 625 (7th Cir.\n1982); Keith v. Daley, 764 F.2d at 1270\n(\"Adequacy can be presumed when the party\non whose behalf the applicant seeks\nintervention is a governmental body or\nofficer charged by law with representing\nthe interests of the proposed\n\fintervenor.\").\n\n  But, the Reid L. parties respond, at\nthis point in the litigation ISBE is\ntrying to defend the new rules that\nitauthored itself, and then allowed to\ntake effect over the express opposition\nof the JCAR and the Illinois General\nAssembly. The latter point, however, is a\nred herring; the district court properly\nfound that the state authorities did not\nhave the power to override an injunctive\ndecree issued by a federal court to\nremedy a state’s violation of standards\nestablished by federal law. Were it\notherwise, we would risk a return to the\nunlamented period when states asserted\nthe right to interpose their laws against\nunpopular federal civil rights decrees,\nsee Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), a\nperiod that has long been put to rest\nthroughout the country. A remedial order\n\"can neither be nullified openly and\ndirectly by state legislators or state\nexecutive or judicial officers, nor\nnullified indirectly by them,\" id. at 17.\nAs for the former point, it is just\nanother way of arguing that the Reid L.\nparties should be entitled to attack the\npresent rules in the capacity as\nintervening parties to the Corey H.\nlitigation, even though their motion was\nuntimely. The problem with this argument\nis its ex post perspective. The ISBE\nrepresented their interests vigorously in\nits opposition to Corey H.: its being\nsensible enough to enter into a consent\ndecree in no way left the Reid L. parties\nunrepresented, and the ISBE is entitled\nto defend the rules it drafted. Everyone\nmust now comply with the rules the ISBE\nitself has chosen to enact, under the\nspur of the liability finding, until such\ntime as a new opportunity for public\ninput on revised rules arises or until\nthe court chooses to terminate the\ndecree.\n\n\n  B.   Permissive Intervention\n\n  The court denied the motions for\npermissive intervention for the same\nreasons it denied the motions for\nintervention of right. With respect to\npermissive intervention, however, our\nreview is more deferential. \"Reversal of\na district court’s denial of permissive\nintervention is a very rare bird indeed,\nso seldom seen as to be considered\n\funique.\" Shea v. Angulo, 19 F.3d 343, 346\nn.2 (7th Cir. 1994). Once again, the\nuntimely nature of the requests, the\nprejudice that the existing parties to\nthe case would suffer, and the\nquestionable nature of the legal injuries\nthe proposed intervenors would suffer,\nall combine to demonstrate that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying this part of the\nmotions.\n\nIII\n\n  The Reid L. parties pursued an\nalternative avenue of attack on the new\nteacher certification rules and the\ntransition system before it took effect\nby filing a separate suit for declaratory\nand injunctive relief. We have\njurisdiction to review the district\ncourt’s denial of preliminary injunctive\nrelief. 28 U.S.C. sec. 1292(a)(1).\n\n  A party seeking to obtain a preliminary\ninjunction must demonstrate a likelihood\nof success on the merits, a lack of an\nadequate remedy at law, and a future\nirreparable harm if the injunction is not\ngranted. See Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson\n& Co., 971 F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir. 1992).\nOnce the court is satisfied that these\nthree conditions have been met, it must\nconsider the harm that the nonmoving\nparty will suffer if the injunction is\ngranted, balancing it against the\nirreparable harm to the moving party from\nthe denial of relief. See Storck USA,\nL.P. v. Farley Candy Co., 14 F.3d 311,\n314 (7th Cir. 1994). Finally, the court\nmust consider the interest of and harm to\nnonparties from a denial or grant the\ninjunction. Id.\n\n  The district court explained in its\norder denying the preliminary injunction\nthat it was doing so for several reasons:\nthe Reid L. parties had failed to\nexercise due diligence in bringing the\nmotion; they lacked standing to attack\nthe rulings in the Corey H. case; they\nwere not likely to succeed on the merits\nof their claims; and finally, it found\nthat the harms foreseeable to them if the\ninjunction were denied were less than the\nharms that the Corey H. parties would\nsuffer were the injunction granted. In\nreviewing the denial of a preliminary\ninjunction, this court adopts a\ndeferential stance: we review any\n\ffindings of fact the district court made\nfor clear error, and we review its\nbalancing of the considerations for or\nagainst an injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion. United Airlines, Inc. v.\nInternational Ass’n of Machinist and\nAerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, 243 F.3d 349,\n360 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\n  The principal substantive claim the Reid\nL. parties are asserting is that the ISBE\nharmed them by not conducting formal\npublic hearings before it implemented the\nnew certification rules--something they\nbelieve can be redressed under 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 1983. They find the source of the\npublic hearing requirement in the IDEA,\nunder which state agencies must conduct\nsuch public hearings as a prerequisite\nfor their eligibility for federal funding\nunder the Act. 20 U.S.C. sec.\n1412(a)(20). Not having the appropriate\nhearings, they contend, is the requisite\npredicate violation of federal law.\nNotably, the section says nothing about\nthe right of either schoolchildren or\ntheir teachers to compel anyone to hold\nsuch hearings; it merely creates a\nprecondition for the state to receive\nfunds. Without such a right, any sec.\n1983 claim is a nonstarter.\n\n  Under the Illinois Administrative\nProcedure Act, there is also a\nrequirement for notice and an opportunity\nto comment. From a technical standpoint,\nit is true that the new certification\nrules were promulgated without the\nrequired notice, in apparent violation of\n5 ILCS 100/5-40. But for several reasons,\nthe violation is only apparent. First, as\nthe Monitor had suggested, the rules were\npromulgated under the alternative\nstatutory authority to issue peremptory\nrules, found in 5 ILCS 100/5-50. The\nrules were later suspended by the JCAR in\nany event, which meant that the new rules\nhad been prevented from going into effect\nas a matter of state law. But it was then\nthat the federal court stepped in and\nmooted any point about compliance with\nstate administrative procedures. Rather\nthan using these procedures, the court\nsimply ordered on February 27, 2001, that\nthe rules were to go into effect. Since\nthe court could have simply drafted a\ncomplete remedial decree on its own,\nwithout any assistance at all from the\nISBE or Illinois administrative procedure\nrules, we see no ground for basing a\n\ffederal lawsuit on an alleged failure to\nfollow state law. See, e.g., Kirkland v.\nNew York State Dept. of Correctional\nServs., 628 F.2d 796, 801 (2d Cir. 1980)\n(once a violation of federal law is\nfound, the power of the district court to\nfashion a remedy arises as a matter of\nfederal law, and nonconformance with\nstate law is immaterial).\n\n  Furthermore, as was noted above, there\nwas extensive public input into the\ndevelopment of these rules, which assured\nfrom a practical standpoint that the\npurposes of notice and comment\nrequirements were fulfilled.\n\n  The district court also thought that the\nReid L. parties neither had standing to\nsue nor a private right of action to\nenforce the public hearing provisions of\nthe statute. We need not resolve this\nissue definitively, as we are satisfied\nthat the court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying the injunction. But\nwe confess to serious doubts about the\nstanding of the teacher-plaintiffs. It is\nhard to see what legally protected\ninterest of theirs has been invaded and\nhow the invasion has injured them. No\nteacher will be decertified because of\nthe new certification standards or the\ntransition rules; teachers will be able\nto qualify for the new LBS1 certificate\nover a three-year period, through their\nordinary continuing education process;\nand in the meantime teachers may not be\nforced to teach in areas for which they\nare unprepared. We would have just as\nlittle sympathy if an attorney complained\nthat her law license was impaired because\nthe state bar toughened its continuing\nlegal education or bar membership\nrequirements. See, e.g., Brown v. McGarr,\n774 F.2d 777 (7th Cir. 1985). One has no\nlegally protectible interest in taking\neasy classes rather than hard ones. Thus,\nit appears that the teachers lack\nstanding to participate in the present\ncase. As for the Reid L. students, once\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs obtained relief\nthat redressed the statutory violation,\nany injury they may have had has already\nbeen redressed. It is hard to imagine any\nabstract interest the students might have\nin the kinds of hearings on proposed rule\nchanges that took place in the past that\nwould qualify under familiar federal\nstanding rules. See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).\n\fBut, as noted before, we do not need to\nresolve this definitively for purposes of\nruling on a preliminary injunction\ndenial; it is enough to say that there is\nonly a small likelihood of success on the\nmerits on this point.\n\n  We are equally dubious about whether 20\nU.S.C. sec. 1412(a)(20) confers a private\nright of action on either the teachers or\nthe students. In the past, sec. 1415\nactions have been brought only to redress\nindividual denials of appropriate care to\na child, not for failures to comply with\nhearing and notice requirements for\nbroader rule-making exercises. As the\nappellees note, in Alexander v. Sandoval,\n532 U.S. 275 (2001), the Supreme Court\nheld that no implication of a private\nright of action should be read into a\nstatute that merely sets forth\nrequirements that an entity must meet in\norder to receive federal funds. Id. at\n290. It seems that this is all that sec.\n1412(a)(20) does.\n\n  When, prior to the oral argument on the\ndenial of intervention, the preliminary\ninjunction appeal was argued to this\ncourt, the Reid L. parties also urged\nthat it was unfair to foreclose any\nmethod of participation for them: if they\ncould not intervene (as the district\ncourt had held by then), then they must\nbe able to bring an independent action;\nif they could not sue separately, then\nintervention must be an option. But our\nreasons for rejecting intervention do not\nimply that a timely motion to participate\nin the case would or should have been\ndenied, and nothing the district court\nsaid leads us to believe that it would\nhave frowned on such an effort. Rights\ncan be lost, and that one was. That does\nnot mean that the district court was\nrequired to permit exactly the same kind\nof disruption under the guise of a free-\nstanding action for injunctive\nrelief.Under the present circumstances,\nthe denial of both avenues is perfectly\nlegitimate, given that the parties did\nnot make the requisite showing under\neither one.\n\n  To prevail on the merits of their\nrequest for a permanent injunction, the\nReid L. parties would have to convince\nthe court that the remedy it has just\nordered for the IDEA violations it found\nin 1998 is itself a separate violation of\n\fthe statute. The district court\nreasonably evaluated as slim their\nlikelihood of success on that claim, even\nassuming they could surmount the standing\nproblem. This is not because children\noutside the class certified in Corey H.\nare bound as parties to that outcome, on\nsome sort of virtual representation\ntheory. They are not. But the procedural\narguments based on the IDEA and state law\nare weak, and as a substantive matter it\nwill be hard for them to show that the\nremedy the court has adopted, with ISBE’s\ninput, is not at least one of the\nsolutions to the violation that was\nacceptable. It need not be the only one,\nor even the best one, as long as it\nremedies the violation in a properly tai\nlored way and respects the law otherwise,\nboth of which it fulfills.\n\nIV\n\n  In No. 01-3432, we AFFIRM the orders of\nthe district court denying the motions to\nintervene of the Reid L. parties. In No.\n01-2707, we AFFIRM the district court’s\ndenial of the Reid L. parties’ motion for\na preliminary injunction. The district\ncourt is free to proceed with any matters\nstill before it in a manner consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\f",

In these\ntwo cases, which we have consolidated\nsolely for the purpose of issuing our\nopinion, certain parties are seeking to\nenjoin the Illinois State Board of\nEducation (ISBE) from promulgating and\nimplementing new rules on special\neducation teacher certification. The Reid\nL. parties are minor children enrolled in\nIllinois public schools outside of\nChicago; they all have been classified by\ntheir respective school districts as\n\fhaving disabilities, within the meaning\nof the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. sec. 1400\net seq. The Corey H. parties are their\ncounterparts within the City of Chicago.\n\n  After a great deal of litigation, which\nwe describe below, the district court\nentered a remedial decree designed to\nbring the Illinois system of special\neducation teacher certification into\ncompliance with various requirements of\nthe IDEA, particularly its directive that\nstudents be educated in the least\nrestrictive environment, see 20 U.S.C.\nsec. 1412(a)(5). The two appeals before\nus represent the efforts of the Reid L.\nparties to prevent the new rules\ndeveloped pursuant to the district\ncourt’s order from entering into effect\n(or, if necessary, to roll them back).\nThe Reid L. appeal (No. 01-2707) arises\nfrom the district court’s denial of a\npreliminary injunction that would have\nstopped the rules from going into effect\non July 1, 2001. The Reid L. parties and\ncertain teachers also tried to intervene\ndirectly in the Corey H. litigation; the\nCorey H. appeal (No. 01-3432) is brought\nby the would-be intervenors to challenge\nthe denial of their motions to intervene.\nWe conclude that the district court did\nnot err either in refusing to enjoin the\nnew rules or in denying the Reid L.\nparties’ attempt to intervene in the\nCorey H. case; we therefore affirm.\n\nI\n\n  In order to place the present dispute in\ncontext, we must look back a quarter of a\ncentury to the way in which children with\ndisabilities have received their\neducation in the Chicago Public Schools.\nIn 1975, Congress passed the Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act, Pub. L.\n94-142 (Nov. 29, 1975), which for the\nfirst time required that children with\ndisabilities be educated with the least\nrestrictive accommodations possible. In\n1990, Congress replaced that statute with\nthe IDEA. In the meantime, however,\nChicago had done little to change the way\nin which it handled the education of the\naffected students. Briefly put, it relied\nheavily on categorization of both\nstudents and teachers, and had little\nflexibility for cross-categorical or\nindividualized arrangements.\n\f  On May 22, 1992, the Corey H. plaintiffs\nand their parents, acting on behalf of\nthemselves and all similarly situated\ndisabled students attending the Chicago\nPublic Schools (CPS), filed an action in\nfederal court against the Board of\nEducation of the City of Chicago, the\nSuperintendent of the Board, and the\nIllinois State Board of Education,\nclaiming that the defendants had failed\nto provide students with disabilities who\nattended the CPS with a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive\nenvironment, as mandated by the IDEA,\nsec.sec. 1412(a)(1) and (5). The Chicago\nBoard and the ISBE opposed class\ncertification, but the district court\ndisagreed and certified the Corey H.\nclass on February 1, 1993, at the same\ntime denying the defendants’ motion to\ndismiss.\n\n  Four years later, on February 10, 1997,\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs filed a second\namended complaint, in which they alleged\nthat the ISBE violated the IDEA by\nfailing to ensure that an adequate supply\nof qualified special education teachers\nand related personnel was available and\nproperly trained. On July 29, 1997, joint\nexperts hired by all the parties in Corey\nH. issued a report. Their report\nconcluded that the current certification\nsystem for special education teachers was\nin part responsible for the failures in\nthe education of the affected children.\nThat system employed eight disability\ncategories: learning disabilities,\nsocial/emotional disorders, educable\nmentally handicapped, trainable mentally\nhandicapped, physically handicapped,\nblind/visually impaired, deaf/hard of\nhearing, and speech/ language\nhandicapped. The report described this\nsystem as \"archaic\" and asserted that\n\"the current certification system results\nin categorical service delivery, limits\nthe way staff can be used and limits\ninvolvement in general education. . . .\"\nThe experts reported also that the\ncertification system improperly supported\nthe segregation of students with\ndisabilities according to their\ndisability category and unlawfully\nlimited the educational environment in\nwhich they were placed.\n\n  In September 1997, the Corey H.\nplaintiffs and the Chicago Board reached\na settlement, which the district court\n\fpreliminarily approved on October 23,\n1997. The district court ordered the\nparties to provide notice of the\nsettlement, and it then held a fairness\nhearing on January 16, 1998. That\nsettlement was finally approved on that\nday, and its terms are not part of the\npresent controversy.\n\n  What continued after that settlement was\nthe question of the ISBE’s liability. As\nto that part of the case, the Corey H.\nparties and the ISBE proceeded to trial\non October 20, 1997. See Corey H. v.\nBoard of Education of the City of\nChicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1598469\"><a href=\"/opinion/1598469/corey-h-v-board-of-educ-of-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 903 (N.D. Ill.\n1998). On February 19, 1998, the district\ncourt found in favor of the plaintiffs on\nthe liability question, holding that the\nISBE had violated the least restrictive\nenvironment mandate of the IDEA. Id. The\ncourt’s findings specifically singled out\nthe categorical system of special\neducation teacher certification as a\ncontributing factor to the violation.\nAccordingly, the court ordered the ISBE\nto develop rules and regulations for\nteacher certification that would bring\nthe state into compliance with the\nstatute.\n\n  Rather than appealing the liability\ndecision, the ISBE and the plaintiff\nparties entered into settlement\ndiscussions with respect to remedies.\nTheir efforts bore fruit a year later,\nand on March 24, 1999, the district court\npreliminarily approved the proposed\nsettlement, and ordered notice and a\npublic hearing which was scheduled for\nJune 18, 1999. The notice was\ndisseminated widely throughout both\nChicago and the state; it elicited\nhundreds of written comments on the\nsettlement. Importantly, people from\nthroughout the State of Illinois\nresponded, many with objections. Among\nthe responders was the Illinois Education\nAssociation (IEA), the principal\nteachers’ organization in Illinois, which\nsubmitted a letter through its president,\nBob Haisman.\n\n  Although the Corey H. litigation\nconcerned only the Chicago public\nschools, it was obvious that the teacher\ncertification issue would affect the\nentire state. Illinois has long since\ndone away with separate teacher\ncertification standards for Chicago and\n\fthe rest of the state, and thus to fix\nmatters for Chicago inevitably meant a\nchange in statewide standards. See 105\nILCS 5/14-9.01 (\"No person shall be\nemployed to teach any class or program\nauthorized by this Article [Children with\nDisabilities] . . . unless he has had\nsuch special training as the State Board\nof Education may require.\"). At the start\nof the hearing, in fact, the district\ncourt advised the participants that if\nthey had wished to have a more formal\nvoice in the content of the settlement\nagreement, they should have moved earlier\neither to intervene or to submit a brief\namicus curiae. Nevertheless, there was\nextensive testimony from interested\nparties.\n\n On the same day that the fairness\nhearing was held, June 18, 1999, the\ndistrict court entered an order approving\nthe settlement between the Corey H.\nplaintiffs and the ISBE. The settlement\nagreement covered a number of topics, in\ncluding monitoring procedures and\npolicies, pre-school services, funding\npolicies, and, central for present\npurposes, teacher certification. Instead\nof having the court draft the detailed\nremedial plan, the parties agreed that\nISBE would have the primary\nresponsibility to develop special\neducation teacher certification rules, in\ncooperation with the CBE and the\nplaintiffs. Any such rules were subject\nto the court’s retained jurisdiction to\nensure that any plan eventually adopted\nwas consistent with the permanent\ninjunction the court had already entered\nagainst ISBE forbidding further\nviolations of the IDEA. See Corey H., 995\nF. Supp. at 918.\n\n  The ISBE set out to do just that. Even\nbefore the settlement agreement had been\napproved, in 1998, the ISBE began working\nwith Illinois parents, advocates for\nstudents with disabilities, and\neducators, to revamp these teacher\ncertification rules. It created two\nadvisory panels, which conducted a dozen\npublic statewide hearings on the issue.\nThe panels also sent proposed\ncertification standards to numerous\noutsiders, including teachers,\nuniversities, and professional\nassociations, for their comments. In\nOctober 1999, the panels submitted their\nreport to the ISBE, recommending that the\n\fexisting eight categories be reduced to\nfive. Because opinions still conflicted\nso strongly on the best way to achieve\nthe goals of the IDEA, however, the ISBE\nthen convened another Blue Ribbon Task\nForce, which met in February 2000 to\ndevelop recommendations for certification\nof special education teachers. That task\nforce suggested combining the five\ncategorical certificates (learning\ndisability, social/emotional disorder,\neducable mentally handicapped, trainable\nmentally handicapped, and physically\nhandicapped) into two new certificates--\none for Learning Behavior Specialist\nAdapted Curriculum Focus, and the other\nfor Learning Behavior Specialist Modified\nCurriculum Focus. In addition to these\ntwo recommendations, the IEA and the\nIllinois Special Education Coalition\nsubmitted a proposal recommending\nretention of the eight categorical\ncertificates and adding a new cross-\ncategorical certificate.\n  At this point, the ISBE realized that it\nwas decision time. The diversity of views\nthat were before it made it clear that\nthe Board was not likely to find a\nconsensus solution that made everyone\nhappy. In coming up with its final\nproposal, it took a number of factors\ninto account, including the fact that\nmany students’ disabilities touch several\nof the old categories, the need to train\nteachers properly for any new system that\nwas implemented, the impact of any new\nsystem on the supply of special education\nteachers, the impact of any new system on\nthe ability of local school districts to\ndeliver services to disabled students,\nthe length of time needed to implement\nany new system, and the effect of a new\nsystem on existing teachers. The ISBE\nstaff accordingly developed its own\noption, which contemplated one\ncertificate (\"Learning Behavior\nSpecialist 1\", or LBS1) for all the\nformer categorical certificates (learning\ndisability, etc., as mentioned above),\nand separate certification for\nspecialists in teaching students who have\nvision impairments, hearing impairments,\nor early childhood or speech/language\ndisorder. This was the proposal the ISBE\nsubmitted for the approval of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  The court had appointed a Monitor to\nassist it in overseeing both the Chicago\nBoard’s and the ISBE’s compliance with\n\ftheir respective settlement agreements.\nThe Monitor accordingly submitted\ncomments on the ISBE’s proposed\ncertification rules on June 22, 2000. In\nthose comments, the Monitor suggested\nthat the certification rules should be\nsubmitted as peremptory rules to the\nJoint Committee on Administrative Rules\n(JCAR) in the Illinois General Assembly\n(a legislative support services agency\ncreated under Illinois law, see 5 ILCS\n100/5-90). See also 5 ILCS 100/5-50\n(describing peremptory rulemaking). On\nSeptember 12, 2000, the district court\naccepted the Monitor’s recommendation and\nordered the ISBE to file its proposed\ncertification rules as peremptory rules\nunder the Illinois Administrative\nProcedure Act. It concluded that this was\nproper because these rules were \"required\nas a result of federal law, federal rules\nand regulations, [or] an order of a\ncourt,\" see 5 ILCS 100/5-50, not as a\n\"consent order or other court order[ ]\nadopting settlements negotiated by the\nagency,\" see id. ISBE never would have\ntaken action had it not been for the\ncourt’s February 1998 decision on\nliability and the remedial order that\nfollowed.\n\n  On October 26, 2000, the ISBE published\nthe certification rules under its\nperemptory rulemaking authority. The\nrules identify specific common standards\nthat all special education teachers must\nmaster, as well as standards for those\nwho want the LBS1 certificate. At that\npoint, however, a tug-of-war at the state\nlevel emerged. In January 2001, JCAR\nsuspended the rules, claiming that they\nconstituted a serious threat to the\npublic interest and welfare. The district\ncourt judge then met with the Corey H.\nparties and certain members of the\nIllinois General Assembly to decide what\nto do. These efforts at consensus also\nfailed, however; on February 21, 2001,\nJCAR again announced that the rules were\nsuspended. On February 27, 2001,\nexercising the power to act independently\nof the ISBE altogether that it had\nreserved in both the ruling on liability\nand in the settlement agreement, the\ncourt ordered the ISBE to implement the\nrules immediately without referral to\nJCAR. The Illinois 92nd General Assembly\nalso attempted to stop the implementation\nof the rules, voting to continue\nindefinitely the suspension of the rules\n\fand passing a joint resolution of both\nhouses on May 31, 2001.\n\n  At the same time, the court ordered the\nISBE to conduct public hearings on\nanother set of rules, the Rules for Tran\nsition to the New Special Education\nCertification Structure (transition\nrules). The transition rules outlined the\nprocedure for teachers holding\ncertificates under the old system to\nbecome requalified as holders of the LBS1\ncertificate. Essentially, they created a\nthree-year grace period for such\nteachers, giving them time to acquire any\nadditional training they might need.\nDuring that interim period, no Illinois\nschool district would be permitted to\nassign a transitional teacher to teach\nstudents outside his or her prior\ncategorical certificate. As ordered by\nthe court, the ISBE held public hearings\non the transition rules in March 2001. It\nreceived extensive comments. As a result\nof those comments, ISBE proposed\nsplitting the LBS1 certificate into two\n(general curriculum and differentiated\ncurriculum), but the district court\nrefused to do so.\n\n  On June 28, 2001, the court ordered the\nISBE to implement the transition rules.\nWe now turn back to the parties who are\nattempting to challenge these results\nfrom the Corey H. case: the plaintiffs in\nthe Reid L. litigation (who are also the\nproposed intervenors in the Corey H.\ncase, which allows us to refer to them\nsimply as the Reid L. parties). On May 7,\n2000, the Reid L. parties (a group\nofspecial education teachers and students\nwho live outside the boundaries of the\nChicago Public School district, and are\nhence nonmembers of the Corey H. class)\nfiled a motion to intervene in the Corey\nH. litigation. Their motion alleged that\nthe ISBE had violated the IDEA, the 11th\nand 14th Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution, and the Illinois\nAdministrative Procedure Act when it\npromulgated both the certification rules\nand the transition rules. On August 15,\n2001, the district court denied the Reid\nL. students’ motion to intervene; on\nAugust 30, 2001, it denied the Reid L.\nteachers’ motion to intervene. Appeal No.\n01-3432 is from those orders of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  Meanwhile, on June 4, 2001, the Reid L.\n\fparties filed a separate action for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief (No. 01\nC 4180 in the district court). The\ncomplaint in the injunction action\ncontained exactly the same allegations as\nthe motion to intervene. The district\ncourt denied the Reid L. parties’ request\nfor a preliminary injunction and a tempo\nrary restraining order on June 28, 2001;\nAppeal No. 01-2707 in this court concerns\nthat order. We consider first the Reid L.\nparties’ arguments with respect to their\nmotions to intervene; we then turn to\ntheir effort to obtain injunctive relief.\n\nII\n\n  In remarks delivered in open court, the\ndistrict court gave several reasons for\ndenying the motions to intervene, either\nof right or permissively. First, he found\nthat the Reid L. parties filed their\nmotion too late: \"the individual named\nintervenors . . . knew about the case for\na long time. The case has been\nextensively publicized throughout the\nstate. I can certainly take notice of\nthat, because it all came out in the\nfairness hearing back in June of 1999,\nmore than two years ago.\" Timing alone,\nthe district court found, was \"enough to\ndeny the motion.\" In that connection, the\ncourt also noted the active role that the\nIEA was playing in the Reid L. effort and\ncommented that had they tried to\nintervene back before all the work was\ndone, they would have had a better\nargument. The court expressed concern for\nthe finality of its order and found that\nto allow the proposed intervention would\nunravel results that had been reached\nsince February of 1998, the date of its\noriginal decision on liability and its\ngeneral injunction against the ISBE. At\nthat early date, the court had identified\nthe need for cross-categorical\ncertification of special education\nteachers in order to comply with the IDEA\nand its \"least restrictive environment\"\nmandate.\n\n  In addition to these central concerns,\nthe court also indicated that it did not\nbelieve that the proposed intervenors had\nshown that they had standing to sue, in\nthat they were asserting only a\ngeneralized interest in a sound\neducational system. Next, it stated that\nthe intervenors had failed to demonstrate\nthat their interests had not been\n\fadequately represented by an existing\nparty, namely, the ISBE (which, the court\nnoted, had opposed the Corey H.\nplaintiffs on the liability merits, and\nthen opposed them at the remedies stage\nfor a long time). Finally, the court\nfound that the intervenors had failed to\nshow that their rights or interests would\nbe impaired by anything in the Corey H.\nsettlement. Placement decisions for\nstudents would continue to be made on a\nchild-by-child basis, pursuant to each\nchild’s individual education plan; and\nteachers had no interest in refusing to\ntailor their continuing educational\ntraining to the requirements of the new\nsystem, which ensured that no one would\nbe decertified.\n\n\n  A.   Intervention of Right\n\n  There are four requirements for\nintervention of right under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n24(a), in the absence of a statute giving\nan absolute right to intervene: (1)\ntimeliness, (2) an interest relating to\nthe subject matter of the main action,\n(3) at least potential impairment of that\ninterest if the action is resolved\nwithout the intervenor, and (4) lack of\nadequate representation by existing\nparties.

The Reid L. parties take\nexception to the court’s characterization\nof them as latecomers to the event. They\ninsist that they acted as soon as they\nrealized that the certification rules\nwere indeed going to be applied on a\n\fstate-wide basis and that the legislature\nwould not be able to protect their\ninterests. They point to February 17,\n2001, as the critical date, because it\nwas then that the district court ruled\nthat the Illinois General Assembly could\nnot nullify its remedial order. They also\npoint out that the rules had not yet been\nimplemented at the time of their\nintervention motion.\n\n  We see no flaw in the district court’s\nconclusion that the Reid L. parties\nwaited too long before attempting to\nintervene. Timeliness is fundamental not\nonly to intervention, but to the overall\nconduct of a lawsuit, and it is a clearly\nspelled out requirement of Rule 24. \"The\npurpose of the [timeliness] requirement\nis to prevent a tardy intervenor from\nderailing a lawsuit within sight of the\nterminal.\" Sokaogon Chippewa Community v.\nBabbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768984\"><a href=\"/opinion/768984/sokaogon-chippewa-community-mole-lake-band-of-lake-superior-chippewa-lac/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949 (7th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotations omitted).

These events provided ample notice\nto the Reid L. parties that their\ninterests might be implicated in the\nISBE’s response to the court’s orders. To\nthe extent that they are arguing that the\nstandard requires that their interests\nhave been impaired beyond any remedy,\nthey are wrong. Indeed, just as we\nrejected this kind of argument in\nSokaogon Chippewa, we reject it here. See\n214 F.3d at 949. The time to intervene\nwas, at the very latest, when the\n\fremedial process began, ten months before\nthe actual motion. That was when the\nrules were being drafted and publicly\ndiscussed; that was when their input\ncould have been received without undoing\nthe long and difficult process that all\nother parties to this litigation had been\npursuing in good faith. Even if we were\nto consider the ten months to be the only\nrelevant delay, we could find no error in\nthe district court’s determination, as a\ndecision about timeliness is reviewed for\nabuse of discretion.

This case is\nclose to completion, after a decade of\nlitigation in the federal courts. If the\nReid L. parties were allowed to enter\nnow, everyone would be forced to return\nto Square One, with the same old\ncertification rules in place, the same\nold problems under the IDEA, and no\nremedy in sight. The district court\ncorrectly noted that our decision in\nPeople Who Care strongly discourages such\neleventh-hour measures. See also United\nStates v. South Bend Community School\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420756\"><a href=\"/opinion/420756/united-states-of-america-and-mary-laura-brookins-v-south-bend-community/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (7th Cir. 1983).\nThis is true notwithstanding the fact\nthat the Reid L. parties will be\ndisadvantaged to the extent that they\nwill have lost the chance to urge ISBE to\nimplement a system more like the old one\nthey are losing. But any such loss is of\ntheir own making; it is perfectly clear\nthat they knew about this litigation and\nwere content to participate on the\nsidelines for a long period of time.\nTheirs is not the kind of prejudice that\nshould weigh in favor of a long-delayed\nmotion for intervention. Since there are\nno other unusual circumstances counseling\nin favor of intervention, we conclude\nthat the district court was justified in\ndenying the motion on the ground of\nuntimeliness.\n\f  Even assuming that untimeliness was not\nenough to bar the claim, intervention as\nof right would still not be appropriate.\nThe Reid L. parties argue that they have\nasserted the kind of substantial interest\nin the new certification rules that would\njustify intervention, claiming that their\ninterest is exactly the same as that of\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs themselves: an\ninterest in the most effective system for\nteaching children with disabilities\nconsistent with the IDEA. At that level\nof generality, of course, they are\ncorrect. But the new element the teacher-\nintervenors seek to introduce into the\ncase is more parochial: they wish to urge\nthat the new rules will force them to\nchange in ways that they regard as\nundesirable. The non-Chicago students\namong the Reid L. group wish only to\nargue that a different solution to the\nproven violation would have been\npreferable. The teachers’ interest is far\nafield from the core concerns of the\nIDEA, which as we have already said are\nto assure the best appropriate education\nfor students with disabilities in the\nleast restrictive environment. As for the\nstudents, while they may have had a valid\ninterest while the new rules were being\ndrafted, now that the rules have been\nembodied in a decree the picture is\ndifferent. Once the new rules are\nimplemented, the violation of the IDEA\nshould be redressed. At that point, the\nReid L. students have merely a\ndisagreement about pedagogical theory\nwith the Corey H. plaintiffs. Such a\nvague concern is not enough to support\nintervention of right. Thus, at either a\nhigh or low level of generality, the Reid\nL. students’ claim for intervention\nfails: if it is a general interest in\nIllinois’s compliance with the IDEA, that\nis taken care of by all the parties in\nthe Corey H. litigation already; if they\nare concerned only with the specifics of\nthe new certification rules, they have no\nindependent interest in the details of\ntheir teachers’ certification, once the\nremedial order brings such certification\nin compliance with federal law.\n\n  We also see no independent interest the\nReid L. intervenors can assert in the\nspecific procedures that were used to\ndevelop the new rules; it is plain on the\nface of this record that extensive\nnotice, opportunity to comment, and\n\freview were involved, and we see nothing\nin the IDEA that requires more.\n\n  Next, we agree with the district court\nthat the Reid L. students have not shown\nhow their interest in the least\nrestrictive educational environment has\nbeen impaired by the new rules. As the\ncourt noted, each pupil will still be en\ntitled to have an individualized\neducation plan developed for him or her;\nschool districts will continue to have an\nobligation to provide qualified personnel\nto teach those students (or to place them\nelsewhere if that cannot be done); and\nstudents will still be able to take\nadvantage of the procedural protections\nafforded by the statute if they or their\nparents believe that the program is\nfalling short.\n\n  Finally, we consider whether the\ndistrict court correctly found that the\nlegally cognizable interests of the Reid\nL. proposed intervenors were adequately\nrepresented by the existing parties to\nthe case. See People Who Care, 68 F.3d at\n177. Insofar as the students had an\ninterest in proving a violation of the\nfederal statute, it is clear that the\nCorey H. parties represented them very\nwell--so much so that a major problem of\nnoncompliance with federal law has been\nredressed. Insofar as the students had an\ninterest in having the court adopt an\neffective remedy for that violation--\nanother thing that was accomplished--it\nis also true that numerous points of view\nwere aired before ISBE and the court\nsettled on the final remedial measures.\nThe mere fact that no student from\ndownstate Illinois was formally entitled\nto party status does not mean that the\ncourt was unexposed to arguments about\nthe virtues of more categorical\ncertification standards, or fewer such\nstandards. As the district court pointed\nout, for much of this litigation ISBE, a\ngovernmental body, was opposing the Corey\nH. plaintiffs in much the same way one\nwould have expected the Reid L. proposed\nintervenors to behave. See generally\nUnited States v.

The latter point, however, is a\nred herring; the district court properly\nfound that the state authorities did not\nhave the power to override an injunctive\ndecree issued by a federal court to\nremedy a state’s violation of standards\nestablished by federal law. Were it\notherwise, we would risk a return to the\nunlamented period when states asserted\nthe right to interpose their laws against\nunpopular federal civil rights decrees,\nsee Cooper v.

The problem with this argument\nis its ex post perspective. The ISBE\nrepresented their interests vigorously in\nits opposition to Corey H.: its being\nsensible enough to enter into a consent\ndecree in no way left the Reid L. parties\nunrepresented, and the ISBE is entitled\nto defend the rules it drafted. Everyone\nmust now comply with the rules the ISBE\nitself has chosen to enact, under the\nspur of the liability finding, until such\ntime as a new opportunity for public\ninput on revised rules arises or until\nthe court chooses to terminate the\ndecree.\n\n\n  B.   Permissive Intervention\n\n  The court denied the motions for\npermissive intervention for the same\nreasons it denied the motions for\nintervention of right.

Finally, the court\nmust consider the interest of and harm to\nnonparties from a denial or grant the\ninjunction.

In\nreviewing the denial of a preliminary\ninjunction, this court adopts a\ndeferential stance: we review any\n\ffindings of fact the district court made\nfor clear error, and we review its\nbalancing of the considerations for or\nagainst an injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion.

They find the source of the\npublic hearing requirement in the IDEA,\nunder which state agencies must conduct\nsuch public hearings as a prerequisite\nfor their eligibility for federal funding\nunder the Act. 20 U.S.C. sec.\n1412(a)(20). Not having the appropriate\nhearings, they contend, is the requisite\npredicate violation of federal law.\nNotably, the section says nothing about\nthe right of either schoolchildren or\ntheir teachers to compel anyone to hold\nsuch hearings; it merely creates a\nprecondition for the state to receive\nfunds. Without such a right, any sec.\n1983 claim is a nonstarter.\n\n  Under the Illinois Administrative\nProcedure Act, there is also a\nrequirement for notice and an opportunity\nto comment. From a technical standpoint,\nit is true that the new certification\nrules were promulgated without the\nrequired notice, in apparent violation of\n5 ILCS 100/5-40. But for several reasons,\nthe violation is only apparent. First, as\nthe Monitor had suggested, the rules were\npromulgated under the alternative\nstatutory authority to issue peremptory\nrules, found in 5 ILCS 100/5-50. The\nrules were later suspended by the JCAR in\nany event, which meant that the new rules\nhad been prevented from going into effect\nas a matter of state law. But it was then\nthat the federal court stepped in and\nmooted any point about compliance with\nstate administrative procedures. Rather\nthan using these procedures, the court\nsimply ordered on February 27, 2001, that\nthe rules were to go into effect. Since\nthe court could have simply drafted a\ncomplete remedial decree on its own,\nwithout any assistance at all from the\nISBE or Illinois administrative procedure\nrules, we see no ground for basing a\n\ffederal lawsuit on an alleged failure to\nfollow state law.

We need not resolve this\nissue definitively, as we are satisfied\nthat the court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying the injunction. But\nwe confess to serious doubts about the\nstanding of the teacher-plaintiffs. It is\nhard to see what legally protected\ninterest of theirs has been invaded and\nhow the invasion has injured them. No\nteacher will be decertified because of\nthe new certification standards or the\ntransition rules; teachers will be able\nto qualify for the new LBS1 certificate\nover a three-year period, through their\nordinary continuing education process;\nand in the meantime teachers may not be\nforced to teach in areas for which they\nare unprepared. We would have just as\nlittle sympathy if an attorney complained\nthat her law license was impaired because\nthe state bar toughened its continuing\nlegal education or bar membership\nrequirements. See, e.g., Brown v. McGarr,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459024\"><a href=\"/opinion/459024/w-james-brown-an-attorney-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1985). One has no\nlegally protectible interest in taking\neasy classes rather than hard ones. Thus,\nit appears that the teachers lack\nstanding to participate in the present\ncase. As for the Reid L. students, once\nthe Corey H. plaintiffs obtained relief\nthat redressed the statutory violation,\nany injury they may have had has already\nbeen redressed. It is hard to imagine any\nabstract interest the students might have\nin the kinds of hearings on proposed rule\nchanges that took place in the past that\nwould qualify under familiar federal\nstanding rules. See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560-61 (1992).\n\fBut, as noted before, we do not need to\nresolve this definitively for purposes of\nruling on a preliminary injunction\ndenial; it is enough to say that there is\nonly a small likelihood of success on the\nmerits on this point.\n\n  We are equally dubious about whether 20\nU.S.C. sec. 1412(a)(20) confers a private\nright of action on either the teachers or\nthe students. In the past, sec. 1415\nactions have been brought only to redress\nindividual denials of appropriate care to\na child, not for failures to comply with\nhearing and notice requirements for\nbroader rule-making exercises. As the\nappellees note, in Alexander v. Sandoval,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620697/alexander-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Supreme Court\nheld that no implication of a private\nright of action should be read into a\nstatute that merely sets forth\nrequirements that an entity must meet in\norder to receive federal funds. Id. at\n290. It seems that this is all that sec.\n1412(a)(20) does.\n\n  When, prior to the oral argument on the\ndenial of intervention, the preliminary\ninjunction appeal was argued to this\ncourt, the Reid L. parties also urged\nthat it was unfair to foreclose any\nmethod of participation for them: if they\ncould not intervene (as the district\ncourt had held by then), then they must\nbe able to bring an independent action;\nif they could not sue separately, then\nintervention must be an option. But our\nreasons for rejecting intervention do not\nimply that a timely motion to participate\nin the case would or should have been\ndenied, and nothing the district court\nsaid leads us to believe that it would\nhave frowned on such an effort. Rights\ncan be lost, and that one was. That does\nnot mean that the district court was\nrequired to permit exactly the same kind\nof disruption under the guise of a free-\nstanding action for injunctive\nrelief.Under the present circumstances,\nthe denial of both avenues is perfectly\nlegitimate, given that the parties did\nnot make the requisite showing under\neither one.\n\n  To prevail on the merits of their\nrequest for a permanent injunction, the\nReid L. parties would have to convince\nthe court that the remedy it has just\nordered for the IDEA violations it found\nin 1998 is itself a separate violation of\n\fthe statute. The district court\nreasonably evaluated as slim their\nlikelihood of success on that claim, even\nassuming they could surmount the standing\nproblem. This is not because children\noutside the class certified in Corey H.\nare bound as parties to that outcome, on\nsome sort of virtual representation\ntheory. They are not. But the procedural\narguments based on the IDEA and state law\nare weak, and as a substantive matter it\nwill be hard for them to show that the\nremedy the court has adopted, with ISBE’s\ninput, is not at least one of the\nsolutions to the violation that was\nacceptable. It need not be the only one,\nor even the best one, as long as it\nremedies the violation in a properly tai\nlored way and respects the law otherwise,\nboth of which it fulfills.\n\nIV\n\n  In No. 01-3432, we AFFIRM the orders of\nthe district court denying the motions to\nintervene of the Reid L. parties. In No.\n01-2707, we AFFIRM the district court’s\ndenial of the Reid L. parties’ motion for\na preliminary injunction. The district\ncourt is free to proceed with any matters\nstill before it in a manner consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
