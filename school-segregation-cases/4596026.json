In that opinion\nwe held:\n           \"The power of the Legislature to pre-\n     vent the introduction and spread of lnfec-\n     tious and contagious diseases cannot be\n     questioned, and, accordingly, health authori-\n     ties are usually empowered to take such action\n     as may be considered expedient to prevent the\n     outbreak of epidemic and communicable diseases.\n     Thus all rules and regulations  adopted pursuant\n     to legislative  authority, which are reasonably\n     calculated to.preserve the public health, are\n     valid The power to make quarantine regulations\n     is one of the most important conferred upon\n     health authorities and such regulations consti-\n     tute a proper exercise of the police power. These\n     general principles are so firmly entrenched in\n     our system of jurisprudence as to admit of no con-\n     jecture, and we therefore cite no cases to sus-\n     tain them. Your attention is directed to the\n     annotations in 2 A.L.R. 1539 and the legion of\n     cases there cited.\"\n     Section 2 of Article 4477-11 of Vernon's Civil Stat-\nutes, which is styled as the \"Texas Tuberculosis Code\"\nstates as follows:\n\n              \"It is the purpose of this Code to pro-\n         vide care and treatment for those afflicted\n         with tuberculosis, to facilitate their hos-\n         pitalization, and to enable them to obtain\n        ,needed care.\"\n     The Legislature of the State of Texas in Section 4\nof such statute provides that:\n\fMr.              Vowell, page 3 (ml-896)\n      Raymond !,f.\n\n\n           \"Tuberculosis in a contagious, infec-\n      tious, or communicable state is hereby de-\n      clared to be dangerous to public health.\"\n     In providing the duties of the Board for Texas\nState Hospitals and Special Schools, the Legislature\nenacted among other provisions Section 12 (b) which\nstates as follows:\n           \"(b) The Board shall prepare and adopt\n      by-laws, rules,and regulations for the\n      government, control, and management of all\n      State tuberculosis hospitals, prescribing\n      the duties of all officers and employees,\n      and for enforcing the necessary discipline\n      and restraint of all patients.\" (Emphasis\n      added).\n     You state in your letter to us that your Board, which\nis charged with the responsibility of caring for tuber-\nculous patients, has become aware of the fact that many\npatients who voluntarily admit themselves through the\ncounty courts to tuberculosis hospitals and after re-\nceiving some treatment will absent themselves from these\nhospitals while in an active, contagious and communi-\ncable state and against medical advice. You mention that\nthe problem has become so acute that during the present\nfiscal year, 541 or 44.5 percent of all discharged patients\nhave so absented themselves.\n     In seeking to ascertain the intent of the Legislature\nat the time that House Bill 421, 56th Legislature, Regular\nSession, which is now codified as Article 4477-11, Vernon's\nCivil Statutes, was enacted, we must look to Sections 2\nand 4 previously cited, as well as Section 5 of thi.sAct.\nSection 5 Sets out in detail what is'to be done upon re-\nceipt of a report of a case of.tuberculosis to any local\nhealth authority and the measures for protection of other\npersons from infection by such diseased persons. It pro-\nvides that such diseased person must place himself under\nmedical care from a licensed physician, hospital, or clinic\nfor treatment until such time that a certificate can be\nfurnished from such health authority that such person is\nfree from tuberculosis in an infectious or contagious state.\n\fMr. Raymond W. Vowell, page 4 (Ww-896)\n\n\n    Subsection (c) of Section 5 provides as follows:\n          \"(c) Any person who violates the\n    provisions of Section 4 (d), or who fails\n    to follow the directions of the local\n    health authority, or who fails to follow\n    the directions of his attending physician\n    pursuant to Section 4 (c), or who in the\n    opinion of the local health authority can-\n    not be treated with reasanable safety to\n    the public, at home, may be quarantined, as\n    that term is hereinafter defined,'and the\n    local health authority may direct, pur-\n    suant  to rules and regulations promulgated\n    by the Department, the removal of the person\n    to a suitable place for examination, and if\n    such persan is found to be infected with\n    tuberculosis in an infectious and contagious\n    state, then such person may be quarantined,\n    as that term is hereinafter defined, until\n    such person Is no longer in an infectious and\n    contagious state. (Emphasis added).\n          \"Quarantine, as used in this Section,\n     means the limitation of movement and separa-\n     tion, duri,ngthat period of time while in-\n     fectious and contagious, from other persons\n     not so infected, In such places and under\n     such conditions as will prevent the direct\n     or indirect conveyance of such Infectious or\n     contagious condition to others not so infected.\n          \"A person found to be infec'tedwith\n     tuberculosis in an infectious and contagious\n     state and quarantined under the provisions\n     of this Section may be placed in any place\n     suitable for the detention 'and segregation\n     required under the provisions of this Set-\n     tion. If suitable facilities are not avail-\n     able within the jurisdiction of the local\n     health authority, then in such event, the\n     person so quarantined may be transported to\n     a State tuberculosis hospital designated by\n     the Board. The Board is hereby empowered\n     and directed to provide suitable facilities\n     for detention of such individuals.\n\n           . . .#I\n          I,\n\fMr. Raymond W. Vowell, page 5 (W-896)\n\n\n     Subsection (6) of Section 5 provides:\n         \"(d) It shall be the duty of all per-\n    sons infected with tuberculosis, or who,\n    from exposure to tuberculosis, may be liable\n    to endanger others who may come in contact\n    with them, to strictly observe 'such instruc-\n    tions as may be given them by any local\n    health authority of the State in order to\n    prevent the spread of tuberculosis.'\n     Section 6 provides as follows:\n          'Any person violating the provisions\n     of Sections 4 or 5 of this Act shall be\n     guilty of a misdemeanor and upon convic-\n     tion shall be punished by a fine of not\n     less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor more\n     than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and/or\n     by imprisonment in the county jail for not\n     more than thirty (30) days.\"\n      It Is our opinion that the provisions of the Act to\nfight and control the disease of tuberculosis are clear.\nWhile the Tuberculosis Code provides a method for volun-\ntary admission by persons in a contagious condition with\nthis disease to State hospitals, this does not mean that\nsuch persons remain in these tubercular hospitals as\nguests and free to leave at their discretion, It Is our\nopinion that the mode of admission to such hospitals is\nonly ancillary, for only one class of persons are eligible\nto gain admittance and they are those who have tuberculo-\nsis in an active, contagious and communicable state and who\ncannot be treated safely in the community from which they\ncome. Once these persons are admitted either voluntarily\nor involuntarily, your Board is charged with the duty and\nthe responsibility of caring for such persons until such\ntime as they can be pronounced free from this contagious\ndisease.\n     It is our further opinion that the Board for Texas\nState Hospitals and Special Schools has the authority by\nvirtue of Subsection (b) of Section 12 of this Act to pro-\nmulgate such rules and regulations for the restraint of\n\"all\" patients as they think necessary. The general rule\nis that where statutes delegate to subordinate governmental\n\fMr. Raymond W. Vowell, page 6 (m-896)\n\n\nagencies and authorities the power to enact, establish\nand enforce health regulations, they are to be liberally\nconstrued in order to effectuate the DurDose of their\nenactment. 25 Am. Jur.,Health, Sec. 8, p. 291. So long\nas such regulations are reasonable and impartial and\nnot against the general policy of the State, they must\nbe submitted to by individuals for the good of the public.\nRegulations by an agency authorized to promulgate them\nwill be sustained if upon a reasonable construction there\nappears to be some substantial reason why they will pro-\nmote the public health and if they are reasonably adapted\nto or tend to accomplish the result sought. To this end,\nthe constitutional guarantees of due process and equal\nprotection of the law were not intended to limit the\nsubjects from which the police power of a state may law-\nfully be exerted. 25 Am. Jur., Health, Sec. 21, pP. 299,\n300.\n-\n     Your second question concerns the liability of the\nheads of the hospital for damages in carrying out the regu-\nlations adopted by the Board.\n     It is the general rule that the agents of the State\nshall not be personally held liable for their acts when\ndone pursuant to statute or Official acts Derformed in\nthe administration of their official duty - Chester Ra\nMorris v. Arno Nowotny, et al, 323 S.W. 2d 3d\ncases cited therein. When acting within the scope of a\nstatute or valid rule promulgated by your Board,.it is\nour opinion that officials so acting would fall within\nthis general rule of immunity as to personal llablllty.\n\n                     SUMMARY\n         The Board for Texas State Hospitals and\n         Special Schools may legally adopt ap-\n         propriate rules and regulations provid-\n         ing for the restraint of patients who\n         have voluntarily committed themselves to\n         their care when such person attempts to\n         leave the hospital while in an active,\n         contagious and communicable state and\n         against medical advice.\n         The general rule Is that the agents of\n\fMr. Raymond W.

Vowell, page 4 (Ww-896)\n\n\n    Subsection (c) of Section 5 provides as follows:\n          \"(c) Any person who violates the\n    provisions of Section 4 (d), or who fails\n    to follow the directions of the local\n    health authority, or who fails to follow\n    the directions of his attending physician\n    pursuant to Section 4 (c), or who in the\n    opinion of the local health authority can-\n    not be treated with reasanable safety to\n    the public, at home, may be quarantined, as\n    that term is hereinafter defined,'and the\n    local health authority may direct, pur-\n    suant  to rules and regulations promulgated\n    by the Department, the removal of the person\n    to a suitable place for examination, and if\n    such persan is found to be infected with\n    tuberculosis in an infectious and contagious\n    state, then such person may be quarantined,\n    as that term is hereinafter defined, until\n    such person Is no longer in an infectious and\n    contagious state. (Emphasis added).\n          \"Quarantine, as used in this Section,\n     means the limitation of movement and separa-\n     tion, duri,ngthat period of time while in-\n     fectious and contagious, from other persons\n     not so infected, In such places and under\n     such conditions as will prevent the direct\n     or indirect conveyance of such Infectious or\n     contagious condition to others not so infected.\n          \"A person found to be infec'tedwith\n     tuberculosis in an infectious and contagious\n     state and quarantined under the provisions\n     of this Section may be placed in any place\n     suitable for the detention 'and segregation\n     required under the provisions of this Set-\n     tion. If suitable facilities are not avail-\n     able within the jurisdiction of the local\n     health authority, then in such event, the\n     person so quarantined may be transported to\n     a State tuberculosis hospital designated by\n     the Board. The Board is hereby empowered\n     and directed to provide suitable facilities\n     for detention of such individuals.\n\n           . . .#I\n          I,\n\fMr. Raymond W. Vowell, page 5 (W-896)\n\n\n     Subsection (6) of Section 5 provides:\n         \"(d) It shall be the duty of all per-\n    sons infected with tuberculosis, or who,\n    from exposure to tuberculosis, may be liable\n    to endanger others who may come in contact\n    with them, to strictly observe 'such instruc-\n    tions as may be given them by any local\n    health authority of the State in order to\n    prevent the spread of tuberculosis.'\n     Section 6 provides as follows:\n          'Any person violating the provisions\n     of Sections 4 or 5 of this Act shall be\n     guilty of a misdemeanor and upon convic-\n     tion shall be punished by a fine of not\n     less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor more\n     than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and/or\n     by imprisonment in the county jail for not\n     more than thirty (30) days.\"\n      It Is our opinion that the provisions of the Act to\nfight and control the disease of tuberculosis are clear.\nWhile the Tuberculosis Code provides a method for volun-\ntary admission by persons in a contagious condition with\nthis disease to State hospitals, this does not mean that\nsuch persons remain in these tubercular hospitals as\nguests and free to leave at their discretion, It Is our\nopinion that the mode of admission to such hospitals is\nonly ancillary, for only one class of persons are eligible\nto gain admittance and they are those who have tuberculo-\nsis in an active, contagious and communicable state and who\ncannot be treated safely in the community from which they\ncome. Once these persons are admitted either voluntarily\nor involuntarily, your Board is charged with the duty and\nthe responsibility of caring for such persons until such\ntime as they can be pronounced free from this contagious\ndisease.\n     It is our further opinion that the Board for Texas\nState Hospitals and Special Schools has the authority by\nvirtue of Subsection (b) of Section 12 of this Act to pro-\nmulgate such rules and regulations for the restraint of\n\"all\" patients as they think necessary. The general rule\nis that where statutes delegate to subordinate governmental\n\fMr. Raymond W. Vowell, page 6 (m-896)\n\n\nagencies and authorities the power to enact, establish\nand enforce health regulations, they are to be liberally\nconstrued in order to effectuate the DurDose of their\nenactment. 25 Am. Jur.,Health, Sec. 8, p. 291. So long\nas such regulations are reasonable and impartial and\nnot against the general policy of the State, they must\nbe submitted to by individuals for the good of the public.\nRegulations by an agency authorized to promulgate them\nwill be sustained if upon a reasonable construction there\nappears to be some substantial reason why they will pro-\nmote the public health and if they are reasonably adapted\nto or tend to accomplish the result sought. To this end,\nthe constitutional guarantees of due process and equal\nprotection of the law were not intended to limit the\nsubjects from which the police power of a state may law-\nfully be exerted. 25 Am. Jur., Health, Sec. 21, pP. 299,\n300.\n-\n     Your second question concerns the liability of the\nheads of the hospital for damages in carrying out the regu-\nlations adopted by the Board.\n     It is the general rule that the agents of the State\nshall not be personally held liable for their acts when\ndone pursuant to statute or Official acts Derformed in\nthe administration of their official duty - Chester Ra\nMorris v.
