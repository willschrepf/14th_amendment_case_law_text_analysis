(Alameda County\nCALIFORNIA CAPITAL INSURANCE                       Super. Ct. No. RG11571734)\nCOMPANY,\n        Defendant, Cross-complainant, and\n        Appellant.\n\n\n        In this appeal from a judgment confirming an insurance appraisal award,\nCalifornia Capital Insurance Company (California Capital) contends the trial court erred\nin compelling an appraisal that required the appraisal panel to assign loss values to items\nthe insured claimed were damaged in a fire even if the items were not damaged or did not\nexist. It also claims the court erred in confirming the appraisal award, arguing that the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by issuing two competing and vastly different\nvalues for the loss.\n        We agree with California Capital that the award issued in this case pursuant to the\ntrial court’s directive neither complies with the terms of the governing statute nor\naccomplishes the objectives of an appraisal. It was error to compel the appraisal panel to\nassign loss values to items simply because they were listed in the insured’s scope of loss\nand regardless of whether inspection revealed they were undamaged or never existed.\nAccordingly, we reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In November 2010, a fire damaged an apartment building in Oakland owned by\nLi-Lin Sung Lee (the “property”). The property consists of a four-story building\ncontaining a total of twelve apartments, with four units on each of three levels and a\nfourth garage level underneath. The fire started in a ground floor unit—unit number 3.\nAccording to California Capital, the flames did not extend beyond unit 3. Lee claims the\nfire damaged six of the twelve apartments with fire or smoke.\n       The property was insured at the time of the fire under a California Capital policy\nissued to Lee. Based on its investigation, California Capital prepared an interim estimate\nof damage to unit 3 of $69,255.34. In December 2010, it issued an initial payment to Lee\nof $46,755.34, representing the initial estimate less depreciation and the applicable\ndeductible. California Capital made additional payments directly to vendors for\ndemolition and fire restoration.\n       Lee retained licensed public adjuster Kevin Dawson to assist her in the\npresentation of her claim. In February 2011, Dawson submitted a claim to California\nCapital on behalf of Lee. The total claim exceeded $800,000. The statement of loss\nprovided breakdowns of the claimed costs for cleaning, asbestos abatement,\nreconstruction of the affected apartments, and loss of rent. As set forth in Dawson’s\nclaim on behalf of Lee, the fire loss consisted of burn damage to unit 3 and smoke\ndamage to the “common” walls located between apartments on the two floors above\nunit 3. According to the claim submitted by Dawson, all the interior rooms of five\napartments other than unit 3 would need to be completely dismantled and then replaced.\nThe claim also included removal of a portion of the stucco exterior around the building,\nas well as removal of iron balcony railings, followed by a repainting of the entire\nbuilding.\n       California Capital sought to inspect the property and investigate the new claim.\nDawson questioned the need for further investigation. In March 2011, Dawson made a\nwritten demand for appraisal pursuant to Insurance Code section 2071. California\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fCapital contended it did not have a sufficient opportunity to review and respond to the\ninsured’s claim, and again requested that an inspection be allowed.\n       In April 2011, Lee filed a petition to compel an insurance appraisal and to appoint\nan umpire to oversee the appraisal. California Capital opposed the petition on the\ngrounds that (1) it was premature because it had not completed its adjustment of the\nclaim, (2) the petition improperly sought appraisal of only the insured’s scope of loss, and\n(3) appraisal of a disputed scope of loss is unauthorized. At a hearing conducted in\nJune 2011, the trial court continued the matter for one month in order to allow California\nCapital to re-inspect the property and respond to the claim presented by Dawson on\nbehalf of Lee. After California Capital completed its re-inspection, it issued an additional\npayment to Lee in the amount of $109,367.41.\n       In supplemental briefing submitted after California Capital completed its re-\ninspection, Lee again demanded that the court order appraisal of her scope of loss.\nCalifornia Capital claimed the court was not authorized to compel an appraisal of\ndisputed items, which included the existence of smoke and fire damage in certain areas,\nthe scope and cause of any damage to exterior stucco, and the need for code upgrades and\nsimilar work to comply with legal requirements, including whether any such work was\ncovered by the policy. California Capital also argued that the insured’s loss estimate and\nscope of loss was inflated and included damages and work unrelated to actual fire\ndamage.\n       In June 2011, the court granted Lee’s petition to compel an insurance appraisal.\nThe court’s order set forth the following guidelines for the appraisal panel: (1) the\nappraisal was to “value the damages caused by the fire only;” (2) the “scope of the loss”\nwas “limited to those items of loss agreed by the parties to have been damaged in the\nfire;” (3) the panel was instructed not to make any coverage or causation determinations;\nand (4) no valuation for loss of rental or business income was allowed.\n       Lee appointed Keith Charleston to serve as her appraiser, while California Capital\nappointed Thad Eaton as its appraiser. After the appraisers were unable to agree upon the\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fselection of a neutral umpire, Lee requested that the court appoint one. The court\nappointed retired Judge Demetrios Agretelis to serve as the umpire.\n       The appraisal hearing commenced on October 11, 2011. Lee’s public adjuster,\nDawson, appeared on her behalf. Dawson argued that the insured’s entire scope of loss\nmust be appraised. By contrast, California Capital argued that the insured’s scope of loss\nwas not a proper subject of the appraisal and that the court had already ruled that only the\nagreed-upon scope of damage should be appraised. The umpire suspended the hearing\npending clarification from the trial court as to what items should be valued at the\nappraisal.\n       Two days after the umpire suspended the appraisal hearing, Lee filed a separate\nlawsuit for breach of contract and bad faith against California Capital. Following the\nfiling of the bad faith lawsuit, California Capital moved to dismiss Lee’s petition to\ncompel an appraisal. Among other things, it argued that Lee had waived any right to\nappraisal by refusing to participate in the appraisal procedure fashioned by the court and\nby filing a bad faith lawsuit. Lee opposed the motion to dismiss, contending that an\nappraisal should proceed with respect to her scope of loss.\n       On November 21, 2011, the trial court denied California Capital’s motion to\ndismiss and modified its July order compelling an appraisal. The modified order directed\nthe appraisal panel to “value three categories of items: (a) items of loss agreed by the\nparties to have been damaged by the fire; (b) items of loss asserted by Lee to have been\ndamaged by the fire but where [California Capital] disputes coverage; and (c) items of\nloss asserted by [California Capital] to have been damaged by the fire but where Lee does\nnot assert a claim.” As in the original order, the modified order directed the panel not to\nmake any causation or coverage determinations, or to value the loss of rental or business\nincome. The modified order also specified as follows: “Following the appraisal\nproceedings, the parties can through other proceedings resolve their disputes regarding\nwhether an appraised item was covered by the policy, whether the item was damaged,\nand whether the item was damaged by the fire.”\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       The appraisal hearing resumed January 10, 2012. California Capital argued that\nLee’s estimate sought an award for items that demonstrably did not ever exist at the\nproperty, including extra windows in all the rooms. The panel declined a request by\nCalifornia Capital to inspect the property. According to California Capital, Lee’s\nappointed appraiser took the position that the panel was obligated to appraise the scope of\nloss presented by the insured, even if it was apparent to the panel that the scope was\nincorrect in matters such as square footage and the number of stories that a building\ncontained.\n       On February 8, 2012, the appraisal panel issued a unanimous appraisal award\nsetting forth, in exhibits A and B to the award, the replacement cost loss and actual cash\nvalue for each claimed item. Exhibit A consisted of items in the insurer’s scope of loss.\nExhibit B consisted of items in the insured’s scope of loss. The panel explained that it\ndid not consider overlaps or duplications between the exhibits. The parties agreed that no\nitems fell into the third category of loss identified by the court in its November 2011\norder—i.e., items that California Capital asserted were damaged but that were not the\nsubject of a claim by Lee. The award listed the following amounts:\n       Exhibit A replacement cost loss (insurer’s scope):       $190,505.21\n       Exhibit A actual cash value loss (insurer’s scope):      $186,041.74\n       Exhibit B replacement cost loss (insured’s scope):       $813,884.89\n       Exhibit B actual cash value loss (insured’s scope):      $788,057.02\n       The appraisal award contains the following limiting language: “The award with\nattached exhibits takes no position on the appropriate scope of construction or method of\nrepair; it makes no determination of coverage under the insurance policy at issue; it does\nnot indicate what is due and owing under the terms of the insurance policy; it does not\nprovide [an] interpretation of the insurance policy; it does not address the question of\nwhether items claimed were in fact damaged/destroyed by the fire damage [sic] or other\nquestions of causation. The panel has made no determination whether the items claimed\nexisted.”\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Roughly one week after the award issued, Dawson sent a letter to California\nCapital asserting that Lee had procured an appraisal award in the amount of $813,884.89.\nThe letter demanded payment and asserted that there was no good faith, genuine dispute\nabout whether the payment was due.\n       On March 1, 2012, California Capital filed a petition to vacate or, in the\nalternative, to correct the appraisal award. It argued that the appraisal panel exceeded its\nauthority by failing to value the loss and instead issuing two vastly different valuations of\nthe same fire loss. It asserted that the appraisal panel valued a theoretical loss, including\nitems that were not damaged or that never existed at the property. It sought to vacate the\naward but argued in the alternative that the award could be corrected by limiting the\nscope of loss to the items that the parties agreed were damaged by the fire—i.e., the\nvalues contained in exhibit A to the award. Thus, California Capital sought to correct the\naward by striking exhibit B and the references to that exhibit. Lee filed an opposition to\nthe petition and separately filed her own petition to confirm the appraisal award.\n       The trial court denied California Capital’s petition to correct and/or vacate the\naward and separately granted in part Lee’s petition to confirm the award. The court’s\norder denying California Capital’s petition states that it was not the appraisal panel’s role\nto decide whether particular items were actually damaged in the fire or replaceable under\nthe policy, or even whether they existed at the time of the fire. According to the court,\n“those are matters as to which the parties preserve a right to trial by jury, and which it\nwas not within the province of appraisers to determine.” In the order granting Lee’s\npetition in part, the court agreed that the award was in conformity with the\nNovember 2011 order compelling appraisal but disagreed with Lee’s proposed form of\njudgment, which failed to include the terms of the award that expressed its limitations.\n       The court entered judgment on July 13, 2012. The judgment attached the\nappraisal award and restated the limiting language contained in the award. Consequently,\nthe judgment reflects that the appraisal award does not address issues of coverage or\ncausation, or even whether the claimed items existed at the time of the fire. California\nCapital timely appealed.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n1.     Governing Legal Principles\n       A.     Scope and Standard of Review\n       In an appeal from an order granting or denying a petition to compel an appraisal,\nwe apply a de novo standard of review when, as here, the issue turns on the interpretation\nof the relevant provisions of the insurance policy and the governing statutory scheme.\n(Cf. Rodriguez v. American Technologies, Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1116–1117\n[de novo standard applies when issue is question of law involving interpretation of\nstatutes and contract with no extrinsic evidence]; JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court\n(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1235 [in absence of conflicting extrinsic evidence offered\nto aid in contract’s interpretation, ruling on petition to compel arbitration is reviewed de\nnovo].) Insofar as a party opposing the appraisal contends the appraisal should have been\nstayed pending resolution of issues outside the scope of an appraisal hearing, we apply an\nabuse of discretion standard in assessing whether the lower court erred in denying the\nstay and compelling an appraisal. (See Alexander v. Farmers Ins. Co., Inc. (2013)\n219 Cal.App.4th 1183, 1190, 1196 [decision whether to stay appraisal is committed to\nsound discretion of trial court].)\n       “Appraisal hearings are a form of arbitration and are generally subject to the rules\ngoverning arbitration. Judicial review of an arbitration, or appraisal award, is\ncircumscribed.” (Kacha v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1031\n(Kacha).) It is not the court’s role to review the merits of the controversy or to determine\nwhether the evidence is sufficient to support the appraisal award. (Ibid.)\n       The exclusive grounds for vacating an appraisal award are set forth in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 1286.2, subdivision (a). (See Maaso v. Signer (2012)\n203 Cal.App.4th 362, 371.) Except as specified in the statute, appraisal awards “are\nimmune from judicial review in proceedings to confirm or challenge the award.” (Ibid.)\nAn appraisal award may be vacated on the following grounds: “(1) The award was\nprocured by corruption, fraud or other undue means. [¶] (2) There was corruption in any\nof the arbitrators. [¶] (3) The rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmisconduct of a neutral arbitrator. [¶] (4) The arbitrators exceeded their powers and the\naward cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the\ncontroversy submitted. [¶] (5) The rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by\nthe refusal of the arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown\ntherefor or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or\nby other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title. [¶] (6) An\narbitrator making the award either: (A) failed to disclose within the time required for\ndisclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware; or\n(B) was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in [Code of Civil Procedure]\nSection 1281.91 but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself\nas required by that provision.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2, subd. (a)., bolding omitted.)\n       “We review the trial court’s ruling on a challenge to an appraisal award under a de\nnovo standard, drawing every reasonable inference to support the award. [Citation.] To\nthe extent the court’s ruling rests on issues of disputed fact, however, we apply the\nsubstantial evidence test.” (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1031.)\n       B.     Law Governing Insurance Appraisals\n       All fire policies issued in California must be on a standard form that includes an\nappraisal provision as set forth in Insurance Code section 2071. (Ins. Code, §§ 2070,\n2071.) Under the statutorily-mandated appraisal provision, the parties are required to\nparticipate in an informal appraisal proceeding in the event there is a disagreement about\nthe actual cash value or the amount of the loss and the insurer or insured makes a written\nrequest for an appraisal.1 The California Capital policy in this case included an appraisal\nprovision consistent with Insurance Code section 2071.\n\n\n       1\n        The appraisal provision in Insurance Code section 2071 provides as follows: “In\ncase the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the\namount of loss, then, on the written request of either, each shall select a competent and\ndisinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of the\nrequest. Where the request is accepted, the appraisers shall first select a competent and\ndisinterested umpire; and failing for 15 days to agree upon the umpire, then, on request of\nthe insured or this company, the umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record\n\n                                              8\n\f       The appraisal process is limited in scope. (Kirkwood v. California State\nAutomobile Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 49, 58 (Kirkwood).)\n“[A]lthough an appraisal is a specific form of limited arbitration, there are significant\ndifferences between the powers of an arbitrator and those of an appraiser.” (Ibid.) An\narbitrator typically exercises “ ‘essentially judicial functions,’ ” including deciding issues\nof law, and often resolves the entire dispute between the parties. (Id. at pp. 58–59.) By\ncontrast, “an appraiser has authority to determine only a question of fact, namely the\nactual cash value or amount of loss of a given item.” (Id. at p. 59.) “ ‘The function of\nappraisers is to determine the amount of damage resulting to various items submitted for\ntheir consideration. It is certainly not their function to resolve questions of coverage and\ninterpret provisions of the policy.’ ” (Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1970)\n3 Cal.3d 398, 403.)\n       A number of published California cases have sought to define the limits of an\nappraisal panel’s authority. In Safeco Ins. Co. v. Sharma (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1060,\n1065–1066 (Sharma), the court held that the appraisal panel exceeded its authority by\ndeciding, in effect, that the policyholder misrepresented the nature of the insured item\nthat was stolen. As explained further below, while we have no dispute with the Sharma\ncourt’s holding based upon the facts of that case, in our view Sharma and its progeny\nhave been misconstrued to suggest that an appraisal panel is compelled to assign a loss\n\n\nin the state in which the property covered is located. Appraisal proceedings are informal\nunless the insured and this company mutually agree otherwise. For purposes of this\nsection, ‘informal’ means that no formal discovery shall be conducted, including\ndepositions, interrogatories, requests for admission, or other forms of formal civil\ndiscovery, no formal rules of evidence shall be applied, and no court reporter shall be\nused for the proceedings. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately\nactual cash value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall submit their\ndifferences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed\nwith this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss. Each\nappraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him or her and the expenses of appraisal and\numpire shall be paid by the parties equally. In the event of a government-declared\ndisaster, as defined in the Government Code, appraisal may be requested by either the\ninsured or this company but shall not be compelled.”\n\n                                              9\n\fvalue to anything that is submitted to it for consideration by an insured, regardless of\nwhether the item was damaged or ever existed. The vastly different and competing\nvaluations of loss arrived at by the appraisal panel in this case, together with the various\ndisclaimers as to the meaning of the valuations, are largely the product of this overly\nexpansive interpretation of Sharma. In order to put the issue into perspective, we briefly\nsummarize three of the key cases bearing upon an appraisal panel’s inability to decide\nissues other than the actual cash value or amount of loss of an item: (1) Sharma, supra,\n160 Cal.App.3d 1060; (2) Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th 1023; and (3) Devonwood\nCondominium Owners Association v. Farmers Insurance Exchange (2008)\n162 Cal.App.4th 1498 (Devonwood).\n              i.     Sharma\n       In Sharma, the insured filed a claim for items stolen in a home burglary. (Sharma,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.3d at p. 1062.) The insured and insurer could not agree on the value\nto assign to a set of 36 eighteenth century Indian “Bundi School” miniature paintings.\nThe insured demanded an appraisal. (Ibid.) The insured claimed the paintings were a\nmatched set, which would be more valuable than an unmatched set of paintings. In\nvaluing the paintings, the appraisal panel effectively concluded the paintings were an\nunmatched set based upon an expert’s opinion that there were no matched sets of Bundi\nSchool paintings on the west coast and that any such sets would be in a museum or a\nwell-known private collection. (Id. at p. 1065.) Consequently, the panel determined the\nmissing artwork was of “average quality” and valued it accordingly. (Id. at p. 1063.)\n       The court in Sharma held the appraisal panel had exceeded its authority by\ndeciding a factual issue not properly before it. (Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at\np. 1066.) According to the court, “[i]n no authority is it suggested that an appraisal panel\nis empowered to determine whether an insured lost what he claimed to have lost or\nsomething different. [¶] When an insurer disputes an insured’s description in\nidentification of the lost or destroyed property, it necessarily claims the insured\nmisrepresented—whether innocently or intentionally—the character of the loss in filing a\nproof of loss. In turn, this claim opens the door to allegations of fraud. Were an insurer\n\n\n                                             10\n\fpermitted to include the former issue within the scope of an appraisal, a determination in\nthe insurer’s favor would foreclose a court from determining one essential element of\nfraud in any subsequent litigation. Certainly, an insurer is free to litigate whether the\ninsured has misrepresented what he lost; but it is beyond the scope of an appraisal.”\n(Id. at pp. 1065–1066.)\n              ii.    Kacha\n       In Kacha, the insured presented a claim for fire and smoke damage resulting from\na wildfire. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1026.) Like Lee in this case, the insured\nretained public adjuster Kevin Dawson, who in turn demanded an appraisal and selected\nKeith Charleston as appraiser. (Id. at p. 1027.) In its appraisal brief, the insurer pointed\nout that the value of the loss was not the only disputed issue because the parties had not\nresolved issues regarding the existence and scope of damage. The insurer claimed that\ndamage to some items was not caused by the wildfire. (Id. at pp. 1027–1028.) In\narriving at an appraisal award, the panel assigned an amount of zero for numerous items\nsubmitted by Dawson on behalf of the insured. (Id. at p. 1029.)\n       Citing Sharma, the Kacha court concluded that the award should have been\nvacated because the appraisal panel exceeded its authority. (Kacha, supra,\n140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036–1037.) The court reasoned that the panel effectively\ndetermined that any claimed damage to various items submitted by Dawson was caused\nby something other than the wildfire. By deciding causation issues instead of just\nlimiting itself to valuing the items within the scope of loss presented by the insured, the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by making determinations that certain claimed\nlosses were not covered by the insured’s policy. (Id. at p. 1036.)\n              iii.   Devonwood\n       Devonwood addressed the form of judgment used to confirm an appraisal award\nwhen there is a dispute about which losses are covered under the applicable policy.\nThere, a condominium owners association submitted a claim for fire damage to a unit.\n(Devonwood, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at p. 1501.) The insurer took the position it had no\nobligation under the policy to pay for interior painting. (Id. at p. 1502.) The appraisal\n\n\n                                             11\n\fpanel issued an award that segregated the replacement cost for interior painting from the\nreplacement cost for all other items. The award specified that the segregation of costs\nwas made “ ‘without consideration of . . . any coverage or other provision of the above\npolicy which might affect the amount of the insurer’s liability thereunder. . . .” (Id. at\np. 1501.) In confirming the appraisal award, the trial court issued a money judgment for\nthe entire amount of the appraisal. (Id. at p. 1503.)\n       The appellate court concluded the judgment had to be vacated because it did not\nconform to the appraisal award, which merely established replacement cost values for the\nclaimed items of damage but did not address liability. (Devonwood, supra,\n162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1503, 1506.) Under those circumstances, the court “was limited\nto the issuance of a judgment which brought finality to the dollar amount of the\nreplacement cost values, and nothing more.” (Id. at p. 1506.) The Devonwood court\nconfirmed that “a judgment after confirmation of an appraisal award fixing the cash value\nof loss does not preclude further litigation on other issues between parties to an insurance\npolicy.” (Id. at p. 1507, fn. 4.)\n       A Devonwood itemization permits an appraisal panel to fulfill its obligation to\nassign loss values to damaged items without exceeding its authority by deciding issues\nthat bear upon causation, coverage, or policy interpretation. The parties are free to\ndispute the insurer’s liability to pay for disputed categories of loss in subsequent\nlitigation.\n2.     Compelling Appraisal of Disputed Items\n       California Capital contends the trial court erred when it modified its order\ncompelling an appraisal to require the appraisal panel to value three categories of items—\nthe items of loss the parties agreed were damaged by the fire, the items of loss asserted by\nLee to have been damaged by the fire but disputed by California Capital, and the items of\nloss asserted by California Capital as to which Lee made no claim. California Capital\nclaims the trial court lacked authority under Insurance Code section 2071 to order such an\nappraisal because it includes disputed items.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       As we explain, a trial court does not necessarily err in compelling appraisal of\ndisputed items when the disputes turn on issues such as coverage, causation, or policy\ninterpretation. Those legal issues can be resolved in subsequent litigation, although it\nmay be appropriate in certain cases to stay an appraisal pending resolution of the disputed\nissues. However, when the disputes turn on the condition or quality of damaged or\ndestroyed items—and it is possible for the panel to assess an item’s condition or quality\nwithout simply having to rely on the insured’s representation—it is error to compel the\nappraisal panel to assign values to items that inspection reveals were not damaged or did\nnot ever exist. In this case, the court erred because it directed the appraisal panel to\nassign loss values to items without regard to whether they were actually damaged.\n       We first address California Capital’s contention that it was error to order an\nappraisal of disputed items. According to California Capital, Insurance Code section\n2071 allows an appraisal panel to value an item of loss only when the parties agree that it\nis within the scope of damage and is covered under the policy. It states that the purpose\nof the appraisal, as expressed in Insurance Code section 2071 and cases interpreting it, is\nto set the amount of loss under the policy for an insured item. California Capital reasons\nthat damage that is not covered, or that is the subject of a coverage dispute, is by\ndefinition not an insured item under a policy. It goes so far as to claim that Sharma,\nKacha, and Devonwood support its interpretation.\n       California Capital fundamentally misreads Sharma, Kacha, and Devonwood. It is\nsimply not the case that an appraisal is limited to items of loss that the parties agree are\ncovered under the policy. In Kacha, the court held that the appraisal panel exceeded its\nauthority by failing to assign a value to an item for which coverage was disputed.\n(Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036–1037.) In Devonwood, the court directed\nentry of judgment confirming an appraisal that included items where there was no\nagreement as to coverage under the policy, with the caveat that the judgment had to\nconform to the appraisal award and indicate the limitations on the award. (Devonwood,\nsupra, 162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1501–1506.) As Kacha and Devonwood demonstrate, an\nappraisal panel may assign a value to items as to which coverage is disputed with the\n\n\n                                              13\n\fdisclaimer that the award does not establish coverage or the insurer’s liability to pay. The\nissue of whether the loss is covered under the policy is a separate, legal issue that must be\nresolved outside the appraisal process.\n       California Capital contends this process is wasteful because it requires the parties\nto engage in a two-step process to resolve a claim. It argues that the appraisal process\nshould be the end, not the beginning, of the valuation dispute. But the process it proposes\nwould be even more wasteful. If an appraisal were limited to items of loss that the parties\nagree are covered, but there is disagreement as to whether certain items are covered, the\nparties would still be required to litigate whether the disputed items are covered. In that\ncase, because there would be no appraised value for disputed items that subsequently may\nbe determined to be covered, the parties would be required to engage in a further attempt\nto appraise the items that were omitted in the first appraisal. Plainly, it is more efficient\nto value all items of loss, including disputed items, at the time an appraisal is performed.\nIf it is determined there is no coverage for certain items, those items can simply be\nstricken from the award without requiring a further referral to an appraisal panel.\n       Moreover, if California Capital believed it was wasteful to engage in an appraisal\nbefore coverage or other legal issues were resolved, it could have sought to stay the\nappraisal pending resolution of those issues in a declaratory relief action. (See Kirkwood,\nsupra, 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 62 [appraisal properly deferred until resolution of legal\nissues in declaratory relief action]; Alexander v. Farmers Insurance Co., supra, 219\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1194–1196 [court has discretion to defer appraisal pending resolution\nof legal issues in declaratory relief action].) In an appropriate case, this approach could\nprovide valuable guidance to an appraisal panel that might otherwise struggle with\ndisputed legal issues that are outside the scope of an appraisal. In this case, California\nCapital did not seek to stay the appraisal pending a resolution of coverage or other legal\nissues. Instead, its position was that an appraisal panel has no authority to appraise an\nitem for which coverage was disputed, and it sought to limit the appraisal to an agreed-\nupon scope of loss. For reasons we have explained, a panel does not necessarily exceed\nits authority by appraising items within a disputed scope of loss when the disputes turn on\n\n\n                                              14\n\fissues of coverage, causation, or other legal issues that an appraisal panel is not\nauthorized to decide.\n       Although we conclude that a court may order appraisal of disputed items under\nappropriate circumstances, we do not think it is appropriate to order a panel to assign loss\nvalues to items that inspection reveals are not damaged or plainly never existed. Here,\nthe court ordered the panel to value items of loss asserted by Lee to have been damaged\nby the fire as to which California Capital disputed coverage. While the court framed the\nissue in terms of appraising items as to which “coverage” was disputed, the court’s order\neffectively directed the panel to value all items of loss claimed by Lee to have been\ndamaged in the fire, regardless of whether those items actually suffered damage or ever\nexisted. Indeed, the court’s order specifically stated that issues concerning whether an\n“item was damaged” could be resolved through subsequent proceedings. Moreover, that\nis how the panel interpreted the order, because it issued its appraisal with the express\ndisclaimer that it made no determination of whether particular items were in fact\ndamaged or ever existed.\n       An assessment of whether an item is damaged or existed is fundamental to a\nvaluation of the amount of the loss. As set forth in Insurance Code section 2071, the\nstandard insuring language in a fire policy requires the insurer to pay “the actual cash\nvalue of the property at the time of loss, but not exceeding the amount which it would\ncost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality . . . .” If an\nitem is undamaged, there is no repair cost and no need to replace the item. Indeed, our\nSupreme Court has stated that “ ‘[t]he function of appraisers is to determine the amount\nof damage resulting to various items submitted for their consideration.’ ” (Jefferson Ins.\nCo. v. Superior Court, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 403, italics added.) In Sharma, the court\nobserved that an item’s “quality or condition” is fundamental to assessing its value.\n(Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at p. 1066.) Clearly, a determination that a component\npart of a building is undamaged is an assessment regarding its condition. Similarly, a\ndetermination that a claimed item of loss did not exist in the manner claimed by the\ninsured bears upon the valuation of the loss. For example, if an insured claims that\n\n\n                                              15\n\fdamaged counters are made of granite but a simple visual examination reveals they\nconsist of a much less expensive material, the panel is not compelled to assign a value for\nrepairing or replacing granite countertops simply because the insured lists them on the\nitems of loss submitted for the panel’s consideration. Similarly, if an insured claims that\na three-story apartment building damaged in a fire actually contains four floors, the panel\nis not required to place a value on a non-existent fourth floor.\n       The notion that an appraisal panel must assign a value to every item submitted by\nthe insured for appraisal—regardless of whether the item existed or was damaged—\nderives from an overly expansive interpretation of the holdings in Sharma and Kacha. In\nSharma, the appraisal panel erred in making a factual determination as to the identity of\nthe stolen property. (Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1065–1066.) The court\ncautioned against confusing identity with quality or condition, which bears upon\nvaluation. (Id. at p. 1066.) In a situation where property is damaged by a calamity such\nas a fire, unlike a circumstance where property is lost or stolen, the question of the\nproperty’s identity typically does not arise, although in some cases it may be necessary to\ndetermine the condition of the property before the loss. The appraisal panel can assess\nfor itself the damaged property’s quality and condition after the loss—factors necessarily\ninvolved in an appraisal of value. There may be cases in which the identity of property\ndamaged in a fire or other calamity is at issue, such as when an item is totally destroyed\nor damaged beyond recognition. (Cf. ibid. [referring to disputes not just about the\nidentity of lost property but also property that is destroyed].) In such cases, it may be\nappropriate to apply the Sharma holding and require the appraisal panel to assign a value\nto items of loss claimed by the insured, without resolving the question of whether the\nitems actually existed. When the pre-loss condition of the property is relevant and there\nis a dispute over the condition of the property prior to the loss, the panel may place more\nthan one value on the loss provided that each value is based on different and explicitly\nstated assumptions concerning the property’s pre-loss condition. But in the typical\nsituation involving fire damage, where the quality or condition of the property is readily\nascertainable and there is no dispute concerning its pre-loss condition, an appraisal panel\n\n\n                                             16\n\fis not compelled by Sharma to assign values to non-existent or incorrectly described\nitems of loss simply because they are claimed by the insured.\n          Similarly, the holding in Kacha does not compel an appraisal panel to assign a loss\nvalue to every item claimed by an insured, regardless of whether that item is damaged. In\nKacha, the appraisal panel assigned a loss value of zero to numerous items submitted by\nthe insured, including the front entry door and decking. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1029.) The insured sought to vacate the award on the ground the panel made\nimproper coverage determinations by awarding nothing for numerous items. The insurer\ncontended the panel awarded nothing for various items simply because it found there was\nno damage to the item and not because it rejected coverage on causation grounds. (Id. at\np. 1035.) In rejecting the insurer’s explanation, the appellate court referred to the\ninsurer’s appraisal brief and noted there appeared to be no dispute that the front entry\ndoor and decking were damaged; the insurer’s primary argument was that the damage\nwas not caused by the fire. Consequently, the court concluded “[i]t is apparent that the\nappraisal panel made at least some coverage determinations, thereby exceeding its\nauthority.” (Ibid.) Notably, the court did not reject the principle that an appraisal panel\nmay award nothing for items that are not damaged. Instead, Kacha stands for the\nprinciple that an appraisal panel exceeds its authority by assigning a value of zero to a\ndamaged item based on a determination that the damage is not covered by the insurance\npolicy.\n          Therefore, an appraisal panel does not necessarily exceed its authority by\nassigning a value of zero to items of loss submitted to it for consideration. If inspection\nreveals an item is undamaged or never existed, it is appropriate for the panel to award\nnothing for loss or damage to that item. The existence of damage to an item as well as\nthe nature of the claimed item are factors that directly bear upon the valuation of the loss,\nincluding the cost to repair or replace the item. By contrast, the cause of any damage\ndoes not bear upon the amount that may be required to repair or replace the item,\nalthough it may be appropriate to include different amounts for the same items of loss\nwhen the condition of the property prior to the loss is disputed and relevant to the\n\n\n                                               17\n\fvaluation. Consequently, while an appraisal panel exceeds its authority by awarding\nnothing for damaged items based on causation or other coverage determinations, a panel\ndoes not exceed its authority by awarding nothing for items that are not damaged or never\nexisted, where the nature or existence of the item is readily ascertainable. If there is a\ndispute about causation, the panel does not exceed its authority if it determines and\nclearly labels different amounts of loss where the amounts differ due to stated\nassumptions about the condition of the property prior to the loss.\n       We observe that it may be difficult to ascertain from an appraisal award the\npanel’s rationale for awarding nothing with respect to a claimed item of loss. In this case,\nfor example, the appraisal award simply lists items of loss along with columns for\nreplacement cost loss and actual cash value. Because every reasonable inference is\ndrawn to support an award (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1031), a court cannot\nassume that an appraisal panel exceeded its authority by awarding nothing for a particular\nitem. Where a reasonable inference can be drawn that the item was undamaged, a court\nmay not vacate the award simply because nothing was awarded for that item. In Kacha,\nit was not reasonable to infer that the items assigned a loss value of zero were undamaged\nwhere the insurer admitted some items were damaged and instead disputed the condition\nof the property prior to the loss and thus causation. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1035.) In order to avoid disputes about whether a panel exceeded its authority by\nassigning a value of zero to certain claimed items of loss, the better practice may be to\nexplain in the award why nothing was awarded. In other words, instead of simply\nplacing a “zero” next to certain items of loss, thus leaving open to debate whether the\npanel based its decision upon an improper coverage determination, the panel could\nindicate “undamaged” next to a particular item, or it could clarify in notes accompanying\nthe award that items assigned a loss value of zero were not damaged or did not exist at\nthe property.\n       In this case, the mere fact the scope of loss was disputed did not preclude the court\nfrom compelling an appraisal. An appraisal may encompass disputed items when the\ndisputes turn on issues of coverage, causation, or policy interpretation. Here, however,\n\n\n                                             18\n\fthe court went further and compelled the appraisal panel to assign loss values to items\nthat may not have been damaged or never existed, simply because the insured claimed the\nitems were damaged. In so doing, the court effectively prevented the appraisal panel\nfrom complying with the dictate of Insurance Code section 2071 to appraise the actual\nloss suffered by the insured. Instead, the panel was required to appraise a hypothetical\nloss, without regard to whether the items ever existed or actually required repair or\nreplacement.\n         For these reasons, we reverse the court’s order of November 21, 2011, compelling\nan appraisal of three categories of items, including items claimed by Lee to have been\ndamaged in the fire. While there was no error in compelling an appraisal, even with\nrespect to certain disputed items, the court erred in directing the appraisal panel to assign\nloss values to items that were undamaged or never existed. On remand, the trial court\nshall issue a revised order compelling an appraisal pursuant to Insurance Code section\n2071. While it is appropriate for the panel to assign values to items of loss where\ncoverage or causation is disputed, it is not appropriate to assign loss values to items that\nare undamaged or that demonstrably never existed.\n3.       Claim that Appraisal Panel Exceeded its Authority\n         California Capital next argues the appraisal award should be vacated because the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by issuing two completely different amounts of\nloss and valuing items that were not damaged or never existed at the property. In light of\nour conclusion that the court erred in compelling an appraisal of items that were not\ndamaged or never existed, it follows that the appraisal award produced in compliance\nwith that order must be vacated. Consequently, our disposition as to the order compelling\nappraisal technically renders California Capital’s separate challenge to the appraisal\naward moot. Nevertheless, we briefly address some of the issues raised by the appraisal\naward in order to provide guidance upon remand for the trial court and the appraisal\npanel.\n         The appraisal award contains two competing and vastly different valuations for the\nreplacement cost loss and actual cash value loss. Whereas one version of the appraisal\n\n\n                                             19\n\famount lists the building’s replacement cost value at $190,505.21, the competing version\nof the appraisal amount lists the building’s replacement cost value at $813,884.89. The\nappraisal panel simply applied consistent unit prices to the scopes of damage offered by\nthe insured and the insurer, without making any effort to remove duplication or overlap\nbetween the two proposed scopes.\n       The appraisal award is fundamentally deficient because it does not provide a\nsingle valuation of the loss suffered by the insured. Instead, it presents two competing\nvaluations with an express disclaimer that the appraisal did not determine the appropriate\nscope and method of repair or whether the submitted items were damaged or ever existed.\nIn effect, the panel simply assigned values to the scopes of damage submitted by each\nside, without resolving any factual questions about the condition and quality of the\nproperty that was damaged in the fire. For example, the competing appraisal amounts\ncontain different estimates for the repair of a single bedroom in one of the affected units.\nThe competing estimates do not contain the same list of items requiring repair in the\nbedroom and apply different square footage numbers for the same spaces. In the case of\na kitchen in one unit, one appraisal amount includes the cost of replacing one window,\nwhereas the competing appraisal amount includes the cost of replacing two windows.\n       It is the responsibility of the appraisal panel to resolve these factual disputes and\narrive at a valuation of the loss. It may be appropriate to segregate some items from the\nothers because there is a dispute as to coverage or causation, but an appraisal should\nordinarily not contain two competing valuations for the same item.2\n       The competing appraisal amounts appear to be the result of the view that an\nappraisal panel is required to apply a value to every item that is presented to it by a party,\nwithout regard to whether the item was damaged or ever existed. As explained above,\nthe panel is not required to assign a value to every item submitted to it for appraisal. If\n       2\n        As discussed, ante, there may be limited circumstances when it is appropriate for\nan appraisal to contain more than one value for an item of loss, such as when the\nproperty’s pre-loss condition is disputed and relevant to the valuation. In such a case, the\nappraisal award should clearly specify the assumptions underlying the competing\nvaluations.\n\n\n                                              20\n\finspection reveals that an item is undamaged or never existed, the panel should not apply\na loss value to the item. In addition, the panel should apply a single set of measurements\nto a physical space and determine what is required to effect a repair, instead of offering\ntwo dueling versions of required repairs. If one side claims a room has one window and\nthe other side claims the room has two windows, it is the appraisal panel’s obligation to\nresolve the dispute to arrive at a single value for the loss.\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment confirming the appraisal award is reversed and the matter is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.\nAppellant shall be entitled to costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________\n                                                   McGuiness, P.J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nPollak, J.\n\n\n_________________________\nSiggins, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fTrial court:        Alameda County\n\n\nTrial Judge:        Hon.

It also claims the court erred in confirming the appraisal award, arguing that the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by issuing two competing and vastly different\nvalues for the loss.\n        We agree with California Capital that the award issued in this case pursuant to the\ntrial court’s directive neither complies with the terms of the governing statute nor\naccomplishes the objectives of an appraisal. It was error to compel the appraisal panel to\nassign loss values to items simply because they were listed in the insured’s scope of loss\nand regardless of whether inspection revealed they were undamaged or never existed.\nAccordingly, we reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In November 2010, a fire damaged an apartment building in Oakland owned by\nLi-Lin Sung Lee (the “property”). The property consists of a four-story building\ncontaining a total of twelve apartments, with four units on each of three levels and a\nfourth garage level underneath. The fire started in a ground floor unit—unit number 3.\nAccording to California Capital, the flames did not extend beyond unit 3. Lee claims the\nfire damaged six of the twelve apartments with fire or smoke.\n       The property was insured at the time of the fire under a California Capital policy\nissued to Lee. Based on its investigation, California Capital prepared an interim estimate\nof damage to unit 3 of $69,255.34. In December 2010, it issued an initial payment to Lee\nof $46,755.34, representing the initial estimate less depreciation and the applicable\ndeductible. California Capital made additional payments directly to vendors for\ndemolition and fire restoration.\n       Lee retained licensed public adjuster Kevin Dawson to assist her in the\npresentation of her claim. In February 2011, Dawson submitted a claim to California\nCapital on behalf of Lee. The total claim exceeded $800,000. The statement of loss\nprovided breakdowns of the claimed costs for cleaning, asbestos abatement,\nreconstruction of the affected apartments, and loss of rent. As set forth in Dawson’s\nclaim on behalf of Lee, the fire loss consisted of burn damage to unit 3 and smoke\ndamage to the “common” walls located between apartments on the two floors above\nunit 3. According to the claim submitted by Dawson, all the interior rooms of five\napartments other than unit 3 would need to be completely dismantled and then replaced.\nThe claim also included removal of a portion of the stucco exterior around the building,\nas well as removal of iron balcony railings, followed by a repainting of the entire\nbuilding.\n       California Capital sought to inspect the property and investigate the new claim.\nDawson questioned the need for further investigation. In March 2011, Dawson made a\nwritten demand for appraisal pursuant to Insurance Code section 2071. California\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fCapital contended it did not have a sufficient opportunity to review and respond to the\ninsured’s claim, and again requested that an inspection be allowed.\n       In April 2011, Lee filed a petition to compel an insurance appraisal and to appoint\nan umpire to oversee the appraisal. California Capital opposed the petition on the\ngrounds that (1) it was premature because it had not completed its adjustment of the\nclaim, (2) the petition improperly sought appraisal of only the insured’s scope of loss, and\n(3) appraisal of a disputed scope of loss is unauthorized. At a hearing conducted in\nJune 2011, the trial court continued the matter for one month in order to allow California\nCapital to re-inspect the property and respond to the claim presented by Dawson on\nbehalf of Lee. After California Capital completed its re-inspection, it issued an additional\npayment to Lee in the amount of $109,367.41.\n       In supplemental briefing submitted after California Capital completed its re-\ninspection, Lee again demanded that the court order appraisal of her scope of loss.\nCalifornia Capital claimed the court was not authorized to compel an appraisal of\ndisputed items, which included the existence of smoke and fire damage in certain areas,\nthe scope and cause of any damage to exterior stucco, and the need for code upgrades and\nsimilar work to comply with legal requirements, including whether any such work was\ncovered by the policy. California Capital also argued that the insured’s loss estimate and\nscope of loss was inflated and included damages and work unrelated to actual fire\ndamage.\n       In June 2011, the court granted Lee’s petition to compel an insurance appraisal.\nThe court’s order set forth the following guidelines for the appraisal panel: (1) the\nappraisal was to “value the damages caused by the fire only;” (2) the “scope of the loss”\nwas “limited to those items of loss agreed by the parties to have been damaged in the\nfire;” (3) the panel was instructed not to make any coverage or causation determinations;\nand (4) no valuation for loss of rental or business income was allowed.\n       Lee appointed Keith Charleston to serve as her appraiser, while California Capital\nappointed Thad Eaton as its appraiser. After the appraisers were unable to agree upon the\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fselection of a neutral umpire, Lee requested that the court appoint one. The court\nappointed retired Judge Demetrios Agretelis to serve as the umpire.\n       The appraisal hearing commenced on October 11, 2011. Lee’s public adjuster,\nDawson, appeared on her behalf. Dawson argued that the insured’s entire scope of loss\nmust be appraised. By contrast, California Capital argued that the insured’s scope of loss\nwas not a proper subject of the appraisal and that the court had already ruled that only the\nagreed-upon scope of damage should be appraised. The umpire suspended the hearing\npending clarification from the trial court as to what items should be valued at the\nappraisal.\n       Two days after the umpire suspended the appraisal hearing, Lee filed a separate\nlawsuit for breach of contract and bad faith against California Capital. Following the\nfiling of the bad faith lawsuit, California Capital moved to dismiss Lee’s petition to\ncompel an appraisal. Among other things, it argued that Lee had waived any right to\nappraisal by refusing to participate in the appraisal procedure fashioned by the court and\nby filing a bad faith lawsuit. Lee opposed the motion to dismiss, contending that an\nappraisal should proceed with respect to her scope of loss.\n       On November 21, 2011, the trial court denied California Capital’s motion to\ndismiss and modified its July order compelling an appraisal. The modified order directed\nthe appraisal panel to “value three categories of items: (a) items of loss agreed by the\nparties to have been damaged by the fire; (b) items of loss asserted by Lee to have been\ndamaged by the fire but where [California Capital] disputes coverage; and (c) items of\nloss asserted by [California Capital] to have been damaged by the fire but where Lee does\nnot assert a claim.” As in the original order, the modified order directed the panel not to\nmake any causation or coverage determinations, or to value the loss of rental or business\nincome. The modified order also specified as follows: “Following the appraisal\nproceedings, the parties can through other proceedings resolve their disputes regarding\nwhether an appraised item was covered by the policy, whether the item was damaged,\nand whether the item was damaged by the fire.”\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       The appraisal hearing resumed January 10, 2012. California Capital argued that\nLee’s estimate sought an award for items that demonstrably did not ever exist at the\nproperty, including extra windows in all the rooms. The panel declined a request by\nCalifornia Capital to inspect the property. According to California Capital, Lee’s\nappointed appraiser took the position that the panel was obligated to appraise the scope of\nloss presented by the insured, even if it was apparent to the panel that the scope was\nincorrect in matters such as square footage and the number of stories that a building\ncontained.\n       On February 8, 2012, the appraisal panel issued a unanimous appraisal award\nsetting forth, in exhibits A and B to the award, the replacement cost loss and actual cash\nvalue for each claimed item. Exhibit A consisted of items in the insurer’s scope of loss.\nExhibit B consisted of items in the insured’s scope of loss. The panel explained that it\ndid not consider overlaps or duplications between the exhibits. The parties agreed that no\nitems fell into the third category of loss identified by the court in its November 2011\norder—i.e., items that California Capital asserted were damaged but that were not the\nsubject of a claim by Lee. The award listed the following amounts:\n       Exhibit A replacement cost loss (insurer’s scope):       $190,505.21\n       Exhibit A actual cash value loss (insurer’s scope):      $186,041.74\n       Exhibit B replacement cost loss (insured’s scope):       $813,884.89\n       Exhibit B actual cash value loss (insured’s scope):      $788,057.02\n       The appraisal award contains the following limiting language: “The award with\nattached exhibits takes no position on the appropriate scope of construction or method of\nrepair; it makes no determination of coverage under the insurance policy at issue; it does\nnot indicate what is due and owing under the terms of the insurance policy; it does not\nprovide [an] interpretation of the insurance policy; it does not address the question of\nwhether items claimed were in fact damaged/destroyed by the fire damage [sic] or other\nquestions of causation. The panel has made no determination whether the items claimed\nexisted.”\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Roughly one week after the award issued, Dawson sent a letter to California\nCapital asserting that Lee had procured an appraisal award in the amount of $813,884.89.\nThe letter demanded payment and asserted that there was no good faith, genuine dispute\nabout whether the payment was due.\n       On March 1, 2012, California Capital filed a petition to vacate or, in the\nalternative, to correct the appraisal award. It argued that the appraisal panel exceeded its\nauthority by failing to value the loss and instead issuing two vastly different valuations of\nthe same fire loss. It asserted that the appraisal panel valued a theoretical loss, including\nitems that were not damaged or that never existed at the property. It sought to vacate the\naward but argued in the alternative that the award could be corrected by limiting the\nscope of loss to the items that the parties agreed were damaged by the fire—i.e., the\nvalues contained in exhibit A to the award. Thus, California Capital sought to correct the\naward by striking exhibit B and the references to that exhibit. Lee filed an opposition to\nthe petition and separately filed her own petition to confirm the appraisal award.\n       The trial court denied California Capital’s petition to correct and/or vacate the\naward and separately granted in part Lee’s petition to confirm the award. The court’s\norder denying California Capital’s petition states that it was not the appraisal panel’s role\nto decide whether particular items were actually damaged in the fire or replaceable under\nthe policy, or even whether they existed at the time of the fire. According to the court,\n“those are matters as to which the parties preserve a right to trial by jury, and which it\nwas not within the province of appraisers to determine.” In the order granting Lee’s\npetition in part, the court agreed that the award was in conformity with the\nNovember 2011 order compelling appraisal but disagreed with Lee’s proposed form of\njudgment, which failed to include the terms of the award that expressed its limitations.\n       The court entered judgment on July 13, 2012. The judgment attached the\nappraisal award and restated the limiting language contained in the award. Consequently,\nthe judgment reflects that the appraisal award does not address issues of coverage or\ncausation, or even whether the claimed items existed at the time of the fire. California\nCapital timely appealed.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n1.     Governing Legal Principles\n       A.

It is not the court’s role to review the merits of the controversy or to determine\nwhether the evidence is sufficient to support the appraisal award. (Ibid.)\n       The exclusive grounds for vacating an appraisal award are set forth in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 1286.2, subdivision (a). (See Maaso v.

Except as specified in the statute, appraisal awards “are\nimmune from judicial review in proceedings to confirm or challenge the award.” (Ibid.)\nAn appraisal award may be vacated on the following grounds: “(1) The award was\nprocured by corruption, fraud or other undue means. [¶] (2) There was corruption in any\nof the arbitrators. [¶] (3) The rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmisconduct of a neutral arbitrator.

[Citation.] To\nthe extent the court’s ruling rests on issues of disputed fact, however, we apply the\nsubstantial evidence test.” (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1031.)\n       B.     Law Governing Insurance Appraisals\n       All fire policies issued in California must be on a standard form that includes an\nappraisal provision as set forth in Insurance Code section 2071. (Ins. Code, §§ 2070,\n2071.) Under the statutorily-mandated appraisal provision, the parties are required to\nparticipate in an informal appraisal proceeding in the event there is a disagreement about\nthe actual cash value or the amount of the loss and the insurer or insured makes a written\nrequest for an appraisal.1 The California Capital policy in this case included an appraisal\nprovision consistent with Insurance Code section 2071.\n\n\n       1\n        The appraisal provision in Insurance Code section 2071 provides as follows: “In\ncase the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the\namount of loss, then, on the written request of either, each shall select a competent and\ndisinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of the\nrequest. Where the request is accepted, the appraisers shall first select a competent and\ndisinterested umpire; and failing for 15 days to agree upon the umpire, then, on request of\nthe insured or this company, the umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record\n\n                                              8\n\f       The appraisal process is limited in scope. (Kirkwood v. California State\nAutomobile Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

An\narbitrator typically exercises “ ‘essentially judicial functions,’ ” including deciding issues\nof law, and often resolves the entire dispute between the parties. (Id. at pp. 58–59.) By\ncontrast, “an appraiser has authority to determine only a question of fact, namely the\nactual cash value or amount of loss of a given item.” (Id. at p. 59.) “ ‘The function of\nappraisers is to determine the amount of damage resulting to various items submitted for\ntheir consideration. It is certainly not their function to resolve questions of coverage and\ninterpret provisions of the policy.’ ” (Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1970)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1368309\"><a href=\"/opinion/1368309/jefferson-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403.)\n       A number of published California cases have sought to define the limits of an\nappraisal panel’s authority. In Safeco Ins. Co. v. Sharma (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2152314\"><a href=\"/opinion/2152314/safeco-ins-co-v-sharma/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1065–1066 (Sharma), the court held that the appraisal panel exceeded its authority by\ndeciding, in effect, that the policyholder misrepresented the nature of the insured item\nthat was stolen. As explained further below, while we have no dispute with the Sharma\ncourt’s holding based upon the facts of that case, in our view Sharma and its progeny\nhave been misconstrued to suggest that an appraisal panel is compelled to assign a loss\n\n\nin the state in which the property covered is located. Appraisal proceedings are informal\nunless the insured and this company mutually agree otherwise. For purposes of this\nsection, ‘informal’ means that no formal discovery shall be conducted, including\ndepositions, interrogatories, requests for admission, or other forms of formal civil\ndiscovery, no formal rules of evidence shall be applied, and no court reporter shall be\nused for the proceedings. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately\nactual cash value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall submit their\ndifferences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed\nwith this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss. Each\nappraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him or her and the expenses of appraisal and\numpire shall be paid by the parties equally. In the event of a government-declared\ndisaster, as defined in the Government Code, appraisal may be requested by either the\ninsured or this company but shall not be compelled.”\n\n                                              9\n\fvalue to anything that is submitted to it for consideration by an insured, regardless of\nwhether the item was damaged or ever existed. The vastly different and competing\nvaluations of loss arrived at by the appraisal panel in this case, together with the various\ndisclaimers as to the meaning of the valuations, are largely the product of this overly\nexpansive interpretation of Sharma. In order to put the issue into perspective, we briefly\nsummarize three of the key cases bearing upon an appraisal panel’s inability to decide\nissues other than the actual cash value or amount of loss of an item: (1) Sharma, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2152314\"><a href=\"/opinion/2152314/safeco-ins-co-v-sharma/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Devonwood).\n              i.     Sharma\n       In Sharma, the insured filed a claim for items stolen in a home burglary. (Sharma,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.3d at p. 1062.) The insured and insurer could not agree on the value\nto assign to a set of 36 eighteenth century Indian “Bundi School” miniature paintings.\nThe insured demanded an appraisal. (Ibid.) The insured claimed the paintings were a\nmatched set, which would be more valuable than an unmatched set of paintings. In\nvaluing the paintings, the appraisal panel effectively concluded the paintings were an\nunmatched set based upon an expert’s opinion that there were no matched sets of Bundi\nSchool paintings on the west coast and that any such sets would be in a museum or a\nwell-known private collection. (Id. at p. 1065.) Consequently, the panel determined the\nmissing artwork was of “average quality” and valued it accordingly. (Id. at p. 1063.)\n       The court in Sharma held the appraisal panel had exceeded its authority by\ndeciding a factual issue not properly before it. (Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at\np. 1066.) According to the court, “[i]n no authority is it suggested that an appraisal panel\nis empowered to determine whether an insured lost what he claimed to have lost or\nsomething different. [¶] When an insurer disputes an insured’s description in\nidentification of the lost or destroyed property, it necessarily claims the insured\nmisrepresented—whether innocently or intentionally—the character of the loss in filing a\nproof of loss. In turn, this claim opens the door to allegations of fraud. Were an insurer\n\n\n                                             10\n\fpermitted to include the former issue within the scope of an appraisal, a determination in\nthe insurer’s favor would foreclose a court from determining one essential element of\nfraud in any subsequent litigation. Certainly, an insurer is free to litigate whether the\ninsured has misrepresented what he lost; but it is beyond the scope of an appraisal.”\n(Id. at pp. 1065–1066.)\n              ii.    Kacha\n       In Kacha, the insured presented a claim for fire and smoke damage resulting from\na wildfire. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1026.) Like Lee in this case, the insured\nretained public adjuster Kevin Dawson, who in turn demanded an appraisal and selected\nKeith Charleston as appraiser. (Id. at p. 1027.) In its appraisal brief, the insurer pointed\nout that the value of the loss was not the only disputed issue because the parties had not\nresolved issues regarding the existence and scope of damage. The insurer claimed that\ndamage to some items was not caused by the wildfire. (Id. at pp. 1027–1028.) In\narriving at an appraisal award, the panel assigned an amount of zero for numerous items\nsubmitted by Dawson on behalf of the insured. (Id. at p. 1029.)\n       Citing Sharma, the Kacha court concluded that the award should have been\nvacated because the appraisal panel exceeded its authority. (Kacha, supra,\n140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036–1037.) The court reasoned that the panel effectively\ndetermined that any claimed damage to various items submitted by Dawson was caused\nby something other than the wildfire. By deciding causation issues instead of just\nlimiting itself to valuing the items within the scope of loss presented by the insured, the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by making determinations that certain claimed\nlosses were not covered by the insured’s policy. (Id. at p. 1036.)\n              iii.   Devonwood\n       Devonwood addressed the form of judgment used to confirm an appraisal award\nwhen there is a dispute about which losses are covered under the applicable policy.\nThere, a condominium owners association submitted a claim for fire damage to a unit.\n(Devonwood, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at p. 1501.) The insurer took the position it had no\nobligation under the policy to pay for interior painting. (Id. at p. 1502.) The appraisal\n\n\n                                             11\n\fpanel issued an award that segregated the replacement cost for interior painting from the\nreplacement cost for all other items. The award specified that the segregation of costs\nwas made “ ‘without consideration of . . . any coverage or other provision of the above\npolicy which might affect the amount of the insurer’s liability thereunder. . . .” (Id. at\np. 1501.) In confirming the appraisal award, the trial court issued a money judgment for\nthe entire amount of the appraisal. (Id. at p. 1503.)\n       The appellate court concluded the judgment had to be vacated because it did not\nconform to the appraisal award, which merely established replacement cost values for the\nclaimed items of damage but did not address liability. (Devonwood, supra,\n162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1503, 1506.) Under those circumstances, the court “was limited\nto the issuance of a judgment which brought finality to the dollar amount of the\nreplacement cost values, and nothing more.” (Id. at p. 1506.) The Devonwood court\nconfirmed that “a judgment after confirmation of an appraisal award fixing the cash value\nof loss does not preclude further litigation on other issues between parties to an insurance\npolicy.” (Id. at p. 1507, fn. 4.)\n       A Devonwood itemization permits an appraisal panel to fulfill its obligation to\nassign loss values to damaged items without exceeding its authority by deciding issues\nthat bear upon causation, coverage, or policy interpretation. The parties are free to\ndispute the insurer’s liability to pay for disputed categories of loss in subsequent\nlitigation.\n2.     Compelling Appraisal of Disputed Items\n       California Capital contends the trial court erred when it modified its order\ncompelling an appraisal to require the appraisal panel to value three categories of items—\nthe items of loss the parties agreed were damaged by the fire, the items of loss asserted by\nLee to have been damaged by the fire but disputed by California Capital, and the items of\nloss asserted by California Capital as to which Lee made no claim. California Capital\nclaims the trial court lacked authority under Insurance Code section 2071 to order such an\nappraisal because it includes disputed items.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       As we explain, a trial court does not necessarily err in compelling appraisal of\ndisputed items when the disputes turn on issues such as coverage, causation, or policy\ninterpretation. Those legal issues can be resolved in subsequent litigation, although it\nmay be appropriate in certain cases to stay an appraisal pending resolution of the disputed\nissues. However, when the disputes turn on the condition or quality of damaged or\ndestroyed items—and it is possible for the panel to assess an item’s condition or quality\nwithout simply having to rely on the insured’s representation—it is error to compel the\nappraisal panel to assign values to items that inspection reveals were not damaged or did\nnot ever exist. In this case, the court erred because it directed the appraisal panel to\nassign loss values to items without regard to whether they were actually damaged.\n       We first address California Capital’s contention that it was error to order an\nappraisal of disputed items. According to California Capital, Insurance Code section\n2071 allows an appraisal panel to value an item of loss only when the parties agree that it\nis within the scope of damage and is covered under the policy. It states that the purpose\nof the appraisal, as expressed in Insurance Code section 2071 and cases interpreting it, is\nto set the amount of loss under the policy for an insured item. California Capital reasons\nthat damage that is not covered, or that is the subject of a coverage dispute, is by\ndefinition not an insured item under a policy. It goes so far as to claim that Sharma,\nKacha, and Devonwood support its interpretation.\n       California Capital fundamentally misreads Sharma, Kacha, and Devonwood. It is\nsimply not the case that an appraisal is limited to items of loss that the parties agree are\ncovered under the policy. In Kacha, the court held that the appraisal panel exceeded its\nauthority by failing to assign a value to an item for which coverage was disputed.\n(Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036–1037.) In Devonwood, the court directed\nentry of judgment confirming an appraisal that included items where there was no\nagreement as to coverage under the policy, with the caveat that the judgment had to\nconform to the appraisal award and indicate the limitations on the award. (Devonwood,\nsupra, 162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1501–1506.) As Kacha and Devonwood demonstrate, an\nappraisal panel may assign a value to items as to which coverage is disputed with the\n\n\n                                              13\n\fdisclaimer that the award does not establish coverage or the insurer’s liability to pay. The\nissue of whether the loss is covered under the policy is a separate, legal issue that must be\nresolved outside the appraisal process.\n       California Capital contends this process is wasteful because it requires the parties\nto engage in a two-step process to resolve a claim. It argues that the appraisal process\nshould be the end, not the beginning, of the valuation dispute. But the process it proposes\nwould be even more wasteful. If an appraisal were limited to items of loss that the parties\nagree are covered, but there is disagreement as to whether certain items are covered, the\nparties would still be required to litigate whether the disputed items are covered. In that\ncase, because there would be no appraised value for disputed items that subsequently may\nbe determined to be covered, the parties would be required to engage in a further attempt\nto appraise the items that were omitted in the first appraisal. Plainly, it is more efficient\nto value all items of loss, including disputed items, at the time an appraisal is performed.\nIf it is determined there is no coverage for certain items, those items can simply be\nstricken from the award without requiring a further referral to an appraisal panel.\n       Moreover, if California Capital believed it was wasteful to engage in an appraisal\nbefore coverage or other legal issues were resolved, it could have sought to stay the\nappraisal pending resolution of those issues in a declaratory relief action. (See Kirkwood,\nsupra, 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 62 [appraisal properly deferred until resolution of legal\nissues in declaratory relief action]; Alexander v. Farmers Insurance Co., supra, 219\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1194–1196 [court has discretion to defer appraisal pending resolution\nof legal issues in declaratory relief action].) In an appropriate case, this approach could\nprovide valuable guidance to an appraisal panel that might otherwise struggle with\ndisputed legal issues that are outside the scope of an appraisal. In this case, California\nCapital did not seek to stay the appraisal pending a resolution of coverage or other legal\nissues. Instead, its position was that an appraisal panel has no authority to appraise an\nitem for which coverage was disputed, and it sought to limit the appraisal to an agreed-\nupon scope of loss. For reasons we have explained, a panel does not necessarily exceed\nits authority by appraising items within a disputed scope of loss when the disputes turn on\n\n\n                                              14\n\fissues of coverage, causation, or other legal issues that an appraisal panel is not\nauthorized to decide.\n       Although we conclude that a court may order appraisal of disputed items under\nappropriate circumstances, we do not think it is appropriate to order a panel to assign loss\nvalues to items that inspection reveals are not damaged or plainly never existed. Here,\nthe court ordered the panel to value items of loss asserted by Lee to have been damaged\nby the fire as to which California Capital disputed coverage. While the court framed the\nissue in terms of appraising items as to which “coverage” was disputed, the court’s order\neffectively directed the panel to value all items of loss claimed by Lee to have been\ndamaged in the fire, regardless of whether those items actually suffered damage or ever\nexisted. Indeed, the court’s order specifically stated that issues concerning whether an\n“item was damaged” could be resolved through subsequent proceedings. Moreover, that\nis how the panel interpreted the order, because it issued its appraisal with the express\ndisclaimer that it made no determination of whether particular items were in fact\ndamaged or ever existed.\n       An assessment of whether an item is damaged or existed is fundamental to a\nvaluation of the amount of the loss. As set forth in Insurance Code section 2071, the\nstandard insuring language in a fire policy requires the insurer to pay “the actual cash\nvalue of the property at the time of loss, but not exceeding the amount which it would\ncost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality . . . .” If an\nitem is undamaged, there is no repair cost and no need to replace the item. Indeed, our\nSupreme Court has stated that “ ‘[t]he function of appraisers is to determine the amount\nof damage resulting to various items submitted for their consideration.’ ” (Jefferson Ins.\nCo. v. Superior Court, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 403, italics added.) In Sharma, the court\nobserved that an item’s “quality or condition” is fundamental to assessing its value.\n(Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at p. 1066.) Clearly, a determination that a component\npart of a building is undamaged is an assessment regarding its condition. Similarly, a\ndetermination that a claimed item of loss did not exist in the manner claimed by the\ninsured bears upon the valuation of the loss. For example, if an insured claims that\n\n\n                                              15\n\fdamaged counters are made of granite but a simple visual examination reveals they\nconsist of a much less expensive material, the panel is not compelled to assign a value for\nrepairing or replacing granite countertops simply because the insured lists them on the\nitems of loss submitted for the panel’s consideration. Similarly, if an insured claims that\na three-story apartment building damaged in a fire actually contains four floors, the panel\nis not required to place a value on a non-existent fourth floor.\n       The notion that an appraisal panel must assign a value to every item submitted by\nthe insured for appraisal—regardless of whether the item existed or was damaged—\nderives from an overly expansive interpretation of the holdings in Sharma and Kacha. In\nSharma, the appraisal panel erred in making a factual determination as to the identity of\nthe stolen property. (Sharma, supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1065–1066.) The court\ncautioned against confusing identity with quality or condition, which bears upon\nvaluation. (Id. at p. 1066.) In a situation where property is damaged by a calamity such\nas a fire, unlike a circumstance where property is lost or stolen, the question of the\nproperty’s identity typically does not arise, although in some cases it may be necessary to\ndetermine the condition of the property before the loss. The appraisal panel can assess\nfor itself the damaged property’s quality and condition after the loss—factors necessarily\ninvolved in an appraisal of value. There may be cases in which the identity of property\ndamaged in a fire or other calamity is at issue, such as when an item is totally destroyed\nor damaged beyond recognition. (Cf. ibid. [referring to disputes not just about the\nidentity of lost property but also property that is destroyed].) In such cases, it may be\nappropriate to apply the Sharma holding and require the appraisal panel to assign a value\nto items of loss claimed by the insured, without resolving the question of whether the\nitems actually existed. When the pre-loss condition of the property is relevant and there\nis a dispute over the condition of the property prior to the loss, the panel may place more\nthan one value on the loss provided that each value is based on different and explicitly\nstated assumptions concerning the property’s pre-loss condition. But in the typical\nsituation involving fire damage, where the quality or condition of the property is readily\nascertainable and there is no dispute concerning its pre-loss condition, an appraisal panel\n\n\n                                             16\n\fis not compelled by Sharma to assign values to non-existent or incorrectly described\nitems of loss simply because they are claimed by the insured.\n          Similarly, the holding in Kacha does not compel an appraisal panel to assign a loss\nvalue to every item claimed by an insured, regardless of whether that item is damaged. In\nKacha, the appraisal panel assigned a loss value of zero to numerous items submitted by\nthe insured, including the front entry door and decking. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1029.) The insured sought to vacate the award on the ground the panel made\nimproper coverage determinations by awarding nothing for numerous items. The insurer\ncontended the panel awarded nothing for various items simply because it found there was\nno damage to the item and not because it rejected coverage on causation grounds. (Id. at\np. 1035.) In rejecting the insurer’s explanation, the appellate court referred to the\ninsurer’s appraisal brief and noted there appeared to be no dispute that the front entry\ndoor and decking were damaged; the insurer’s primary argument was that the damage\nwas not caused by the fire. Consequently, the court concluded “[i]t is apparent that the\nappraisal panel made at least some coverage determinations, thereby exceeding its\nauthority.” (Ibid.) Notably, the court did not reject the principle that an appraisal panel\nmay award nothing for items that are not damaged. Instead, Kacha stands for the\nprinciple that an appraisal panel exceeds its authority by assigning a value of zero to a\ndamaged item based on a determination that the damage is not covered by the insurance\npolicy.\n          Therefore, an appraisal panel does not necessarily exceed its authority by\nassigning a value of zero to items of loss submitted to it for consideration. If inspection\nreveals an item is undamaged or never existed, it is appropriate for the panel to award\nnothing for loss or damage to that item. The existence of damage to an item as well as\nthe nature of the claimed item are factors that directly bear upon the valuation of the loss,\nincluding the cost to repair or replace the item. By contrast, the cause of any damage\ndoes not bear upon the amount that may be required to repair or replace the item,\nalthough it may be appropriate to include different amounts for the same items of loss\nwhen the condition of the property prior to the loss is disputed and relevant to the\n\n\n                                               17\n\fvaluation. Consequently, while an appraisal panel exceeds its authority by awarding\nnothing for damaged items based on causation or other coverage determinations, a panel\ndoes not exceed its authority by awarding nothing for items that are not damaged or never\nexisted, where the nature or existence of the item is readily ascertainable. If there is a\ndispute about causation, the panel does not exceed its authority if it determines and\nclearly labels different amounts of loss where the amounts differ due to stated\nassumptions about the condition of the property prior to the loss.\n       We observe that it may be difficult to ascertain from an appraisal award the\npanel’s rationale for awarding nothing with respect to a claimed item of loss. In this case,\nfor example, the appraisal award simply lists items of loss along with columns for\nreplacement cost loss and actual cash value. Because every reasonable inference is\ndrawn to support an award (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1031), a court cannot\nassume that an appraisal panel exceeded its authority by awarding nothing for a particular\nitem. Where a reasonable inference can be drawn that the item was undamaged, a court\nmay not vacate the award simply because nothing was awarded for that item. In Kacha,\nit was not reasonable to infer that the items assigned a loss value of zero were undamaged\nwhere the insurer admitted some items were damaged and instead disputed the condition\nof the property prior to the loss and thus causation. (Kacha, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1035.) In order to avoid disputes about whether a panel exceeded its authority by\nassigning a value of zero to certain claimed items of loss, the better practice may be to\nexplain in the award why nothing was awarded. In other words, instead of simply\nplacing a “zero” next to certain items of loss, thus leaving open to debate whether the\npanel based its decision upon an improper coverage determination, the panel could\nindicate “undamaged” next to a particular item, or it could clarify in notes accompanying\nthe award that items assigned a loss value of zero were not damaged or did not exist at\nthe property.\n       In this case, the mere fact the scope of loss was disputed did not preclude the court\nfrom compelling an appraisal. An appraisal may encompass disputed items when the\ndisputes turn on issues of coverage, causation, or policy interpretation. Here, however,\n\n\n                                             18\n\fthe court went further and compelled the appraisal panel to assign loss values to items\nthat may not have been damaged or never existed, simply because the insured claimed the\nitems were damaged. In so doing, the court effectively prevented the appraisal panel\nfrom complying with the dictate of Insurance Code section 2071 to appraise the actual\nloss suffered by the insured. Instead, the panel was required to appraise a hypothetical\nloss, without regard to whether the items ever existed or actually required repair or\nreplacement.\n         For these reasons, we reverse the court’s order of November 21, 2011, compelling\nan appraisal of three categories of items, including items claimed by Lee to have been\ndamaged in the fire. While there was no error in compelling an appraisal, even with\nrespect to certain disputed items, the court erred in directing the appraisal panel to assign\nloss values to items that were undamaged or never existed. On remand, the trial court\nshall issue a revised order compelling an appraisal pursuant to Insurance Code section\n2071. While it is appropriate for the panel to assign values to items of loss where\ncoverage or causation is disputed, it is not appropriate to assign loss values to items that\nare undamaged or that demonstrably never existed.\n3.       Claim that Appraisal Panel Exceeded its Authority\n         California Capital next argues the appraisal award should be vacated because the\nappraisal panel exceeded its authority by issuing two completely different amounts of\nloss and valuing items that were not damaged or never existed at the property. In light of\nour conclusion that the court erred in compelling an appraisal of items that were not\ndamaged or never existed, it follows that the appraisal award produced in compliance\nwith that order must be vacated. Consequently, our disposition as to the order compelling\nappraisal technically renders California Capital’s separate challenge to the appraisal\naward moot. Nevertheless, we briefly address some of the issues raised by the appraisal\naward in order to provide guidance upon remand for the trial court and the appraisal\npanel.\n         The appraisal award contains two competing and vastly different valuations for the\nreplacement cost loss and actual cash value loss. Whereas one version of the appraisal\n\n\n                                             19\n\famount lists the building’s replacement cost value at $190,505.21, the competing version\nof the appraisal amount lists the building’s replacement cost value at $813,884.89. The\nappraisal panel simply applied consistent unit prices to the scopes of damage offered by\nthe insured and the insurer, without making any effort to remove duplication or overlap\nbetween the two proposed scopes.\n       The appraisal award is fundamentally deficient because it does not provide a\nsingle valuation of the loss suffered by the insured. Instead, it presents two competing\nvaluations with an express disclaimer that the appraisal did not determine the appropriate\nscope and method of repair or whether the submitted items were damaged or ever existed.\nIn effect, the panel simply assigned values to the scopes of damage submitted by each\nside, without resolving any factual questions about the condition and quality of the\nproperty that was damaged in the fire. For example, the competing appraisal amounts\ncontain different estimates for the repair of a single bedroom in one of the affected units.\nThe competing estimates do not contain the same list of items requiring repair in the\nbedroom and apply different square footage numbers for the same spaces. In the case of\na kitchen in one unit, one appraisal amount includes the cost of replacing one window,\nwhereas the competing appraisal amount includes the cost of replacing two windows.\n       It is the responsibility of the appraisal panel to resolve these factual disputes and\narrive at a valuation of the loss. It may be appropriate to segregate some items from the\nothers because there is a dispute as to coverage or causation, but an appraisal should\nordinarily not contain two competing valuations for the same item.2\n       The competing appraisal amounts appear to be the result of the view that an\nappraisal panel is required to apply a value to every item that is presented to it by a party,\nwithout regard to whether the item was damaged or ever existed. As explained above,\nthe panel is not required to assign a value to every item submitted to it for appraisal. If\n       2\n        As discussed, ante, there may be limited circumstances when it is appropriate for\nan appraisal to contain more than one value for an item of loss, such as when the\nproperty’s pre-loss condition is disputed and relevant to the valuation. In such a case, the\nappraisal award should clearly specify the assumptions underlying the competing\nvaluations.\n\n\n                                              20\n\finspection reveals that an item is undamaged or never existed, the panel should not apply\na loss value to the item. In addition, the panel should apply a single set of measurements\nto a physical space and determine what is required to effect a repair, instead of offering\ntwo dueling versions of required repairs. If one side claims a room has one window and\nthe other side claims the room has two windows, it is the appraisal panel’s obligation to\nresolve the dispute to arrive at a single value for the loss.\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment confirming the appraisal award is reversed and the matter is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.\nAppellant shall be entitled to costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________\n                                                   McGuiness, P.J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nPollak, J.\n\n\n_________________________\nSiggins, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fTrial court:        Alameda County\n\n\nTrial Judge:        Hon.
