After Johnson won, he notified Captains Richard Day, the\njail's administrator, and Calvin Hollowell, head of the jail's troubled\nintake area, they would not be reappointed to their positions.                    Day and\nHollowell are black, and Johnson is white.           Before Johnson took office, and\nwhile Day and Hollowell were still employed by Johnson’s predecessor\nSheriff Gravett, Day and Hollowell filed suit against Johnson and the\nPulaski County\n\fSheriff's Department (the Department) under 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17\n(1994) (Title VII) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994), claiming Johnson decided\nnot to reappoint them because of their race and in retaliation for speech\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.    Johnson was ordered to\nretain Day and Hollowell pending trial.   The district court ruled for Day\nand Hollowell on their Title VII claims and for Hollowell on his § 1983\nfree speech claim.    As a remedy, the district court ordered Johnson to\nplace Day and Hollowell in unspecified captain-level positions.       Johnson\nappeals, and we reverse.\n     When he was appointed jail administrator in January 1993, Day became\nchair of the committee charged with managing the upcoming transition from\nthe old to the new jail.   The committee discussed at length the likelihood\nthat the new jail’s housing units would quickly become overcrowded.      When\novercrowding became a reality shortly after the new jail opened in August\n1994, however, Day acted like a man caught unawares.          Although others\ndisagreed, Day put the overflow from the housing units in the jail's intake\narea, the hub of the new jail's entire operation.     Every person arrested\nin Pulaski County must be processed through intake, and every jail inmate\ntransported to the local courts must go out through intake.    Day's decision\nto turn intake into a full-blown housing unit turned out badly for those\nhoused there.   The miserable living conditions caught the attention of the\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, which reported them in widely read stories that\nneither Day nor Hollowell disputed at trial.        Hollowell believed the\nconditions were unconstitutional.   Up to 120 inmates at a time lived in the\nintake area, sharing twelve toilets and three showers, sleeping and\nsometimes even eating on the floor.       Conditions were filthy.      Unlike\ninmates held in the jail's housing units, inmates in intake could not\nreceive family visits and were denied access to the outdoor exercise area.\nIntake staff had to meet inmates' daily\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fliving needs, distracting staff from inmate processing and making the\nlogjam still worse.       A number of staff quit under the pressure, leaving\nvacancies that went unfilled.         Moreover, inmates waiting in intake for\ntransportation to court often got lost in the crowd, turning up in court\nhours late and sometimes not at all.       One municipal court judge was forced\nto make his own separate inmate transportation arrangements after having\nthirteen no-shows in a single day.\n\n\n        Day's use of intake for housing was not merely unsanitary and\ndisruptive, it was dangerous.         Unlike properly housed inmates, who are\nsegregated by sex, criminal history, and type of offense, inmates in intake\nwere not sorted out.     Intake thus held an explosive mix of men and women,\nviolent felons and petty misdemeanants, career criminals and juveniles.\nDay believed the conditions were “ripe for a major riot.”             Day complicated\nmatters by keeping the jail persistently understaffed.              Instead of hiring\nneeded personnel, Day turned back to the county $400,000 in authorized but\nunused    salaries.      Although   Day   believed     the   jail   demanded    “crisis\nmanagement” on his part, Day was unfamiliar with the county’s hiring\npolicies, and merely acquiesced in Sheriff Gravett’s mistaken belief that\nvacancies could not be filled until the departing deputies’ accrued\nvacation time had elapsed.          In fact, vacant positions could be filled\nimmediately.\n        Day doggedly stuck with his failed intake policy, despite front-page\nnewspaper coverage of intake’s deplorable condition and instructions from\nSheriff Gravett to move the overflow into the housing units.                    In mid-\nOctober Hollowell entered the picture when he replaced Captain Talley as\nhead of intake and prisoner transportation.            Hollowell had been familiar\nwith intake's problems since at least early September, when he reported\nthose    problems   to   the   district   court   on   Sheriff      Gravett's   orders.\nHollowell also\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\finformed the media about jail conditions in his role as the Department’s\npublic information officer.      Advance notice of intake’s troubles did not\nhelp Hollowell either.       The district court found intake conditions and\ninmate transportation failed to improve under Hollowell's supervision.\nHollowell made matters worse when he decided to cure overcrowding by\nreleasing, without the required authorization from a judge or prosecutor,\nseven accused felons who were in custody without bail.                     Hollowell's\nshortcut made front-page news, and he was reprimanded by the county\nprosecutor and two local judges.      Although Hollowell apologized and Sheriff\nGravett condoned Hollowell's action, Johnson agreed with the prosecutor,\nthe   judges,   and   the   public   that   the    release    was   a   clear   sign   of\n\"exceedingly bad judgment\" on Hollowell’s part.\n      In Arkansas, when a sheriff’s term in office expires, so do the\nappointments of the sheriff’s deputies.              This puts the newly elected\nsheriff in a position to assemble a competent workforce that meets the new\nsheriff’s expectations.       After he was elected, Johnson interviewed all\ndeputies holding the rank of lieutenant or higher under outgoing Sheriff\nGravett to help Johnson decide whom to reappoint.            Johnson interviewed Day\nand Hollowell, among the rest, questioning Day about intake and staffing,\nand Hollowell about intake and the felon release.             Johnson also conferred\nwith his new chief deputy Danny Bradley and his operations major Skipper\nPolk, Johnson's long-time colleagues in the North Little Rock Police\nDepartment (NLRPD).     Bradley opposed rehiring Day and Hollowell based on\nmedia accounts of the jail’s turmoil and because local police told Bradley\nthey had lost confidence in the two men.          Polk, who had recently worked for\nthe county prosecutor, also advised against keeping Day and Hollowell based\non Hollowell's felon release and on Day’s low regard by the prosecutor's\noffice and local law enforcement.      Johnson also spoke with Lowell Kincaid,\nwho served as planning coordinator for the new jail.                Kincaid had\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fobserved Day's leadership when Kincaid worked with the transition committee\nDay chaired.      Based on what he saw, Kincaid told Johnson that Day was not\nan effective administrator.\n\n\n       On December 12, 1994, Johnson informed Day and Hollowell they would\nnot be reappointed to their posts.         After taking office on the first of\nJanuary, Johnson followed through on his campaign promise to put a\nprofessional administrator in charge of the new jail by appointing Kincaid\nto the newly created position of chief of detention operations.             Neither\nDay nor the district court questioned Kincaid’s qualifications for this\nposition.    Jail conditions improved under Kincaid's leadership:       intake was\nrestored    to    its   intended   purposes,   disciplinary   proceedings   against\ndisruptive inmates declined, and the jail’s failures in transporting\ninmates to court were eliminated.\n\n\n       Johnson made very few personnel moves when he took office.           Out of\na staff of roughly 350 under departing Sheriff Gravett, Johnson rejected\nonly four:       Day, Hollowell, and two whites, Gravett’s chief deputy and a\nlieutenant who opposed Johnson for sheriff.           Four other employees left\nvoluntarily, all of them white.         Day and Hollowell were the only blacks\nwhom Johnson did not reappoint.         Johnson transferred Captain Talley, who\nis black and who had moved to the enforcement division when Hollowell took\nover intake, back to detention.          Johnson also promoted two deputies to\nlieutenant, both black.        Although Johnson inherited a Department with a\ndetention division that historically has employed a higher proportion of\nblacks than enforcement, neither Day nor Hollowell contended, nor did the\ndistrict court find, that the Department’s racial composition reflected\nrace   discrimination.       Johnson's employment decisions have left that\ncomposition virtually undisturbed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f        Johnson testified he rejected Day because Day mismanaged the intake\narea and left staff positions unfilled.      As the district court put it,\nJohnson’s \"bottom line\" was that he “did not have confidence that Day would\nmanage in the way Johnson wanted.\"   Johnson testified he rejected Hollowell\nbecause Hollowell's felon release showed poor judgment, and also because\nof intake conditions and inmate transportation failures.     Summarizing his\nreasons, Johnson said he decided not to reappoint Day and Hollowell based\non \"job performance and the perception of that job performance\" by the\npublic.    In keeping with Johnson’s stated reasons, the district court found\nthe new jail was “chaotic” and understaffed, with a “deplorable” intake\narea that posed “a security risk.”      The district court also found that\ninmates were “delivered to court late,” and acknowledged that Johnson\ngenuinely believed Hollowell's felon release was not \"an exercise in good\njudgment.\"    Notwithstanding these vivid findings, the district court found\nrace was the real reason Day and Hollowell lost their jobs.\n        We review the district court's finding of intentional discrimination\nfor clear error.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 524 (1993).      A finding is clearly erroneous if it\nlacks substantial evidence to support it, see Johnson v. Arkansas State\nPolice, 10 F.3d 547, 552 (8th Cir. 1993), or if, even when there is\nevidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence\nis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made,\nsee United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).\nSubstantial evidence means \"such evidence as a reasonable mind would accept\nas sufficient to support a conclusion.\"    Roberts v. Browning, 610 F.2d 528,\n532 (8th Cir. 1979) (citing Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474,\n477 (1951)).    Day and Hollowell are entitled to reasonable inferences from\nthe evidence, but inferences must be more than speculation or conjecture\nto be\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\freasonable.   See Hopper v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 87 F.3d 983, 988 (8th Cir.\n1996).    Because   Day   and   Hollowell    produced   no   direct   evidence   of\ndiscriminatory intent, we must decide whether they introduced sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence to permit the district court reasonably to infer\nthat Johnson's expressed reasons were unworthy of belief, see Texas Dept.\nof Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981), and that\nintentional discrimination was the real reason Johnson rejected Day and\nHollowell, see Hicks, 509 U.S. at 515.          In other words, even when an\nemployee presents some circumstantial evidence of pretext, a finding of\nintentional discrimination is clearly erroneous if the finding lacks\nplausibility when the evidence is considered as a whole.         See Anderson v.\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985); see also Ryther v. KARE\n11, 108 F.3d 832, 848 (8th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (Part I.A. of concurring\nand dissenting opinion, in which eight active judges joined), petition for\ncert. filed, 65 U.S.L.W. 3694 (U.S. Apr. 4, 1997) (No. 96-1571).         Reviewing\nthe evidence relied on by the district court, we conclude Day and Hollowell\nfailed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence for the district court\nreasonably to infer that Johnson's stated reasons were a coverup for racial\ndiscrimination.\n     To begin with, the district court was clearly mistaken in its view\nthat Johnson was too poorly informed to make an honest assessment of Day's\nand Hollowell's job performances.           The district court made light of\nJohnson’s reliance on news accounts despite its recognition that the jail’s\nproblems were thoroughly aired in media reports that Day and Hollowell\nnever challenged.     Johnson was also informed by “general talk in the\ncommunity,” which included the opinions of local police officers and\nprosecutors, sources public employers like Johnson may rely on.         See Waters\nv. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 676 (1994).       Johnson also made his own first-\nhand observations at the jail, which he visited several times and for\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fseveral hours at a time.    Bolstered by the district court’s finding that\nintake was in a “chaotic” and “deplorable” state, what Johnson saw during\nhis visits would be enough reasonably to convince an observer in Johnson’s\nposition that the jail’s management had failed.      Additionally, the topics\nJohnson raised in Day's and Hollowell's interviews--intake, staffing, and\nthe felon release--show Johnson was well aware of the jail's problems in\ntheir areas of responsibility.\n     The district court believed Johnson's failure to discuss Day's and\nHollowell's qualifications with Sheriff Gravett undermined the plausibility\nof Johnson's nondiscriminatory explanation.         We disagree.      Johnson was\nentitled to put little stock in what Gravett might say about Day’s and\nHollowell’s current job performances because Johnson could evaluate their\nperformances   himself.    Further,     Gravett's   assessment   of    Day's   and\nHollowell's work histories sheds no light on whether Johnson honestly based\nhis employment decisions on their job performances at the new jail.            See\nDey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F.3d 1446, 1460 (7th Cir. 1994).            The\ndistrict court also felt Johnson’s reasons for rejecting Day were “too\nbroad to withstand scrutiny” because Johnson blamed Day for things beyond\nDay's control, like overcrowding and staff turnover.       The district court\nis mistaken.   Johnson blamed Day only for problems Day knew were coming and\nfailed to resolve.   As the district court found, \"everyone involved with\nthe planning of the new jail anticipated that it would be overcrowded,\" and\n\"[s]taff turnover was also expected.\"    Likewise, Hollowell knew about these\nproblems before he took over intake and transportation, and he was unable\nto deal with the problems despite his forewarning.          Johnson was also\njustified in relying on Hollowell’s release of unbailable felons into the\ncommunity as a reason for rejecting him.            The district court found\nJohnson’s reliance was pretextual because Sheriff Gravett condoned the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\frelease and Hollowell apologized and promised never to do it again.                  The\nfocus of the pretext inquiry is Johnson’s motivation, however, and neither\nGravett’s approval nor Hollowell’s promises cast any doubt on the sincerity\nof Johnson’s belief that Hollowell had shown bad judgment.\n\n\n     According to the district court, the \"most telling\" evidence of\npretext was Johnson's appointment of three whites to the top posts in his\nadministration.       Although the district court recognized Johnson had the\nright to hire anyone he wanted for these policymaking positions, which are\nexempt from Title VII under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), the district court found\npretext because Day and Hollowell have better resumes than the appointed\nwhites, Chief Deputy Bradley, Major Polk, and Major Scarborough.                 Day and\nHollowell are captains and have earned four-year college degrees, but\nJohnson’s top three officers have not graduated from college, and only one,\nBradley, had made captain in the NLRPD.          Contrary to the district court's\nview, comparing resumes is meaningless because Day and Hollowell were not\ncandidates    for   any   of   the   positions   Bradley,    Polk,     and   Scarborough\nreceived.    Disparate treatment of black and white employees who are not\nsimilarly situated is not evidence of pretext.            See McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804 (1973); Harvey v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 38 F.3d\n968, 972 (8th Cir. 1994).        Besides, there is powerful evidence that Day and\nHollowell mismanaged the jail despite their fine resumes.\n     Although Johnson made approximately 350 employment decisions when he\ntook office, the district court believed Johnson’s treatment of one black\nofficer,    Captain    Talley,    was   \"probative   of    Johnson's    discriminatory\nattitude.\"    Johnson moved Talley back to detention without asking him if\nhe wanted to move, but Johnson asked a white captain who had no experience\nin the new jail, Jimmy White, if he wanted to remain in his current\nposition and left him\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthere.     Setting aside that Talley and White were not similarly situated,\nthe    district    court’s   concern   about    Talley   is   misplaced   because     any\ndisparate treatment of Talley is irrelevant to Day's and Hollowell's\nclaims.        See Swapshire v. Baer, 865 F.2d 948, 953 (8th Cir. 1989).\nAlthough Talley preferred to stay in enforcement, we see nothing amiss in\nJohnson’s decision to move Talley back to an administrative position in\ndetention to shore up the jail’s troubled operation.              Talley experienced\nthe jail’s failures when carrying out Day’s directions, which he disagreed\nwith, before Day appointed Hollowell to head intake.             Having promised the\nvoters he would solve the jail’s problems, Johnson needed the steadying\nhand of competent leadership at the jail, and Johnson's choice of Talley\nfor a top jail position strikes us as a vote of confidence.\n       The district court found more evidence of Johnson’s discriminatory\nattitude in a career-path policy Johnson established after he took office.\nBecause Johnson considers the Department’s enforcement and detention\ndivisions as separate career paths requiring different skills and training,\nJohnson wants to minimize cross-divisional transfers to take advantage of\nthe expertise that comes with extended experience within a division.\nWithout addressing this race-neutral reason, the district court took the\nview    that    Johnson’s    policy   will   “lock   African-Americans    in   what    is\nconsidered by some as . . . less desirable position[s] in detention,” which\n“traditionally has had a larger percentage of African-American employees”\nthan enforcement.      The record does not support the district court’s view,\nhowever.       In the first place, Johnson’s career-path policy is irrelevant\nto Day’s and Hollowell’s claims because it was not adopted until after\nJohnson decided against their reappointment.             Besides, Johnson inherited\nthe racial imbalance from his predecessors, and Day and Hollowell never\nalleged, nor did the district court find, any racial discrimination in the\nhiring practices of the earlier sheriffs.            Also, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fdistrict court is mistaken that blacks are “lock[ed]” into detention\n“without the opportunity to work in enforcement.”                  In uncontradicted\ntestimony, Johnson made clear that under his policy, deputies in detention\nremain free to apply for available positions in enforcement (and vice\nversa), they receive preference over outsiders, and they switch divisions\nwithout loss of salary or seniority.          They may have to start anew to earn\nrank only because their expertise in the division they left does not\nnecessarily qualify them to exercise command in their new division.\nAlthough the district court’s findings do not reveal who feels jobs in\ndetention are “less desirable” or why, those views shed no light at all on\nJohnson’s attitude.         Actually, the district court’s findings about the\nsorry state of affairs in the jail drive home the importance of a program\nthat encourages stable careers in detention.\n\n\n     Finally, the district court found evidence of pretext in Johnson’s\nconferences with \"white friends,\" appointees Kincaid, Bradley, and Polk,\nbefore rejecting Day and Hollowell.                The district court erroneously\nbelieved Johnson’s appointees lacked \"personal knowledge\" about Day and\nHollowell and thus found their advice “suspect.”            But Kincaid worked with\nDay on the new jail’s transition committee.          Bradley and Polk knew all they\nneeded   to   know   from    news   reports   of    the   jail’s   turmoil   and   from\nconversations with local police officers:           Day and Hollowell were running\na failed operation.    Moreover, the reasons Johnson gave for rejecting Day\nand Hollowell were not concocted with the after-the-fact help of so-called\n\"white friends\" because Johnson promised to make changes at the jail during\nhis campaign for election, and neither Day and Hollowell nor the district\ncourt suggest Johnson’s campaign was racially motivated.               Additionally,\nthere is no evidence that Johnson or his appointees ever made disparaging\nremarks about\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fanyone’s race, and the mere fact Johnson's closest advisors are white does\nnot render their advice \"suspect.\"\n\n\n       Even though Day and Hollowell failed to discredit the legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory     reasons   motivating    Johnson’s   rejection        of   Day   and\nHollowell, the district court felt it was \"incredible\" Johnson would reject\nveteran, well-educated employees with years of satisfactory service in the\nDepartment.    Thus, declaring Day and Hollowell \"competent captain[s],\" the\ndistrict court ordered Johnson to place them in unspecified positions \"at\nthe captain level.\"    Because there is a difference between performing a job\nand holding a rank, a court applying Title VII must ask whether the job\napplicant was qualified for a particular available position, not whether\nthe applicant is an otherwise deserving rankholder.           See Burdine, 450 U.S.\nat 253.    No doubt Day and Hollowell advanced in rank over the years because\nthey   ably handled the positions their increasing rank progressively\nentitled them to fill.    They failed, however, to measure up to their most\nrecent assignments, and rank earned through satisfactory performance in\nother positions does not insulate them from the consequences of failure in\ntheir positions at the new jail.           The district court’s strongly held\nfeeling that Johnson should have paid attention to Day’s and Hollowell’s\npositive    past   accomplishments   “is     nothing   more    than   an    attack     on\n[Johnson’s] judgment [about] how [he] chose to evaluate [Gravett’s]\nemployees.”    Hutson v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 63 F.3d 771, 780 (8th Cir.\n1995).    As we said of the reduction-in-force selection in Hutson, “[t]here\nis nothing inherently discriminatory” in Johnson’s reliance on Day’s and\nHollowell’s recent failures in deciding whether he would include them in\nhis administration.     Id.\n       Although the district court faults Johnson for not considering Day\nand Hollowell for other positions, Day and Hollowell never\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fshowed interest in any other specific positions, suggested bumping other\ncaptains in their favor, or indicated their willingness to accept demotions\nso they might fill lesser positions.        Johnson did not discriminate against\nDay and Hollowell when he did not consider them for positions they did not\nseek.    See Tart v. Levi Strauss & Co., 864 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir. 1988).\nAlthough we understand the district court’s disappointment that Day and\nHollowell lost their jobs, federal courts are not self-appointed personnel\nmanagers, and they may not second-guess the fairness or wisdom of an\nemployer’s nondiscriminatory employment decisions.          See Aucutt v. Six Flags\nOver Mid-America, Inc., 85 F.3d 1311, 1317 (8th Cir. 1996); Harvey, 38 F.3d\nat 973.\n\n\n        The district court's Title VII findings are also flawed because the\ndistrict court failed to draw another inference we find inescapable from\nthe record.     See Arkansas State Police, 10 F.3d at 552.             In its wide-\nranging    search   for   hints   of   pretext,   the   district   court   overlooked\nsubstantial evidence that, job performances aside, Johnson rejected Day and\nHollowell for political reasons.        Assuming Day and Hollowell did the best\nanyone could do under the circumstances at the new jail, the situation\nlooked bad, and they paid the political price for being in the wrong place\nat the wrong time.         Johnson acknowledged he was concerned about the\npublic’s perception of their job performance.               Viewing the facts as\nsympathetically to Day and Hollowell as we can, Day and Hollowell emerge\nas political scapegoats, forced out by Johnson to make good on his campaign\npledge.    In sum, we are convinced Day and Hollowell lost their jobs because\nthey either were or seemed to be responsible for the tangled situation at\nthe new jail, but not because of their race.\n        We turn now to the district court's judgment for Hollowell on his\n§ 1983 free speech claim.         In 1979, the District Court for the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fEastern District of Arkansas assumed jurisdiction over the old Pulaski\nCounty jail under the terms of a consent decree.         About a month after the\nnew jail opened, the district court contacted Hollowell and asked about\njail conditions.    The district court found Hollowell communicated with the\ndistrict court as part of his duties as the Department’s public information\nofficer and at the direction of Sheriff Gravett.              During Hollowell's\nemployment interview, Johnson told Hollowell he disfavors federal court\noversight of the new jail.     The district court believed Johnson's view was\na reasonable one, and recognized as well that neither “[S]heriff [Gravett]\n[n]or    anybody   else”   wanted   federal    supervision.   Johnson   also   told\nHollowell he disagreed with Hollowell's having gone to the district court.\nWhen Johnson gave Hollowell notice he would not be retained, Hollowell felt\nJohnson was retaliating against him for speaking to the court.                  The\ndistrict court agreed.\n\n\n        A public employee's speech enjoys limited protection under the First\nAmendment.     See Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 154 (1983).            Whether\nHollowell's speech was protected is a question of law we review de novo.\nSee Mumford v. Godfried, 52 F.3d 756, 760 (8th Cir. 1995).                Because\nHollowell spoke to the district court on orders from his superior and as\nthe Department's public information officer, not as a concerned citizen,\nwe conclude Hollowell's speech was not protected.              See Bausworth v.\nHazelwood Sch. Dist., 986 F.2d 1197, 1198-99 (8th Cir. 1993).            Although\nHollowell’s conversation with the district court about jail conditions was\nnot put into evidence, we glean from the record that Hollowell’s report\nleft no doubt about the dismal situation at the new jail, which Hollowell\ndid nothing to make better and made even worse through his felon release.\nConsequently, even if Hollowell's speech were protected, his failings as\nhead of intake and transportation convince us Johnson would have rejected\nhis job candidacy anyway.      See Mt.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\n\n     We thus reverse the district court's judgment for Day and Hollowell\non their Title VII claims, and for Hollowell on his § 1983 First Amendment\nclaim, and we dissolve the injunction compelling Johnson to retain Day and\nHollowell in some unspecified positions at the captain level.     Because Day\nand Hollowell are no longer prevailing parties, we also reverse the\ndistrict court's award to them of costs and attorney's fees.     See Pottgen\nv. Missouri State High Sch. Activities Ass’n, 103 F.3d 720, 723-24 (8th\nCir. 1997).\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting.\n\n\n     I   respectfully dissent from the majority’s reversal of the district\ncourt’s judgment for Day and Hollowell on their claims under Title VII.1\nI have no quarrel with the legal standard as outlined by the majority and\napplied by the district court in rendering its decision.       I also believe\nthat the result reached by the majority is one that a trier of fact could\nhave reached given the evidence presented at trial.     Were the majority the\nfactfinder, I would not hesitate to join in its opinion.     But the district\ncourt is the trier of fact and it had the responsibility to examine the\nevidence and to draw the permissible inferences from that evidence.         I do\nnot believe the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination was\nclearly erroneous and I would affirm.\n\n\n     The   district   court   discredited   Johnson’s   explanation   for   not\nretaining Day and Hollowell.    Although the court acknowledged that\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      I concur in the majority opinion with respect to the\nplaintiffs’ section 1983 free speech claim.\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe new facility was severely overcrowded, there was evidence that neither\nplaintiff was solely responsible for the problems at the jail.        The court\nfound that Day and Hollowell attempted to address the problems, but that\nthey were met with lack of cooperation from other county officials and\ndelay caused by the lawsuit over control of the jail.              Particularly\nHollowell, who was not even in charge of intake at the jail until after the\nconditions were publicized, could not be considered responsible for the\nproblems at the jail. The district court also found the circumstances\nsurrounding Johnson’s decision not    to retain Day and Hollowell suspicious:\nJohnson knew very little about either Day or Hollowell when he decided not\nto retain them and he replaced them with white men whose experience and\nqualifications paled in comparison to those of Day and Hollowell.        Having\nrejected Johnson’s proffered reasons for his employment decisions and\nfinding   the   circumstances   surrounding   those   decisions   indicative   of\ndiscriminatory intent, the district court’s ultimate finding of intentional\ndiscrimination was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                   CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

After Johnson won, he notified Captains Richard Day, the\njail's administrator, and Calvin Hollowell, head of the jail's troubled\nintake area, they would not be reappointed to their positions.                    Day and\nHollowell are black, and Johnson is white.           Before Johnson took office, and\nwhile Day and Hollowell were still employed by Johnson’s predecessor\nSheriff Gravett, Day and Hollowell filed suit against Johnson and the\nPulaski County\n\fSheriff's Department (the Department) under 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17\n(1994) (Title VII) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994), claiming Johnson decided\nnot to reappoint them because of their race and in retaliation for speech\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.    Johnson was ordered to\nretain Day and Hollowell pending trial.   The district court ruled for Day\nand Hollowell on their Title VII claims and for Hollowell on his § 1983\nfree speech claim.    As a remedy, the district court ordered Johnson to\nplace Day and Hollowell in unspecified captain-level positions.       Johnson\nappeals, and we reverse.\n     When he was appointed jail administrator in January 1993, Day became\nchair of the committee charged with managing the upcoming transition from\nthe old to the new jail.   The committee discussed at length the likelihood\nthat the new jail’s housing units would quickly become overcrowded.      When\novercrowding became a reality shortly after the new jail opened in August\n1994, however, Day acted like a man caught unawares.          Although others\ndisagreed, Day put the overflow from the housing units in the jail's intake\narea, the hub of the new jail's entire operation.     Every person arrested\nin Pulaski County must be processed through intake, and every jail inmate\ntransported to the local courts must go out through intake.    Day's decision\nto turn intake into a full-blown housing unit turned out badly for those\nhoused there.   The miserable living conditions caught the attention of the\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, which reported them in widely read stories that\nneither Day nor Hollowell disputed at trial.        Hollowell believed the\nconditions were unconstitutional.   Up to 120 inmates at a time lived in the\nintake area, sharing twelve toilets and three showers, sleeping and\nsometimes even eating on the floor.       Conditions were filthy.      Unlike\ninmates held in the jail's housing units, inmates in intake could not\nreceive family visits and were denied access to the outdoor exercise area.\nIntake staff had to meet inmates' daily\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fliving needs, distracting staff from inmate processing and making the\nlogjam still worse.       A number of staff quit under the pressure, leaving\nvacancies that went unfilled.         Moreover, inmates waiting in intake for\ntransportation to court often got lost in the crowd, turning up in court\nhours late and sometimes not at all.       One municipal court judge was forced\nto make his own separate inmate transportation arrangements after having\nthirteen no-shows in a single day.\n\n\n        Day's use of intake for housing was not merely unsanitary and\ndisruptive, it was dangerous.         Unlike properly housed inmates, who are\nsegregated by sex, criminal history, and type of offense, inmates in intake\nwere not sorted out.     Intake thus held an explosive mix of men and women,\nviolent felons and petty misdemeanants, career criminals and juveniles.\nDay believed the conditions were “ripe for a major riot.”             Day complicated\nmatters by keeping the jail persistently understaffed.              Instead of hiring\nneeded personnel, Day turned back to the county $400,000 in authorized but\nunused    salaries.      Although   Day   believed     the   jail   demanded    “crisis\nmanagement” on his part, Day was unfamiliar with the county’s hiring\npolicies, and merely acquiesced in Sheriff Gravett’s mistaken belief that\nvacancies could not be filled until the departing deputies’ accrued\nvacation time had elapsed.          In fact, vacant positions could be filled\nimmediately.\n        Day doggedly stuck with his failed intake policy, despite front-page\nnewspaper coverage of intake’s deplorable condition and instructions from\nSheriff Gravett to move the overflow into the housing units.                    In mid-\nOctober Hollowell entered the picture when he replaced Captain Talley as\nhead of intake and prisoner transportation.            Hollowell had been familiar\nwith intake's problems since at least early September, when he reported\nthose    problems   to   the   district   court   on   Sheriff      Gravett's   orders.\nHollowell also\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\finformed the media about jail conditions in his role as the Department’s\npublic information officer.      Advance notice of intake’s troubles did not\nhelp Hollowell either.       The district court found intake conditions and\ninmate transportation failed to improve under Hollowell's supervision.\nHollowell made matters worse when he decided to cure overcrowding by\nreleasing, without the required authorization from a judge or prosecutor,\nseven accused felons who were in custody without bail.                     Hollowell's\nshortcut made front-page news, and he was reprimanded by the county\nprosecutor and two local judges.      Although Hollowell apologized and Sheriff\nGravett condoned Hollowell's action, Johnson agreed with the prosecutor,\nthe   judges,   and   the   public   that   the    release    was   a   clear   sign   of\n\"exceedingly bad judgment\" on Hollowell’s part.\n      In Arkansas, when a sheriff’s term in office expires, so do the\nappointments of the sheriff’s deputies.              This puts the newly elected\nsheriff in a position to assemble a competent workforce that meets the new\nsheriff’s expectations.       After he was elected, Johnson interviewed all\ndeputies holding the rank of lieutenant or higher under outgoing Sheriff\nGravett to help Johnson decide whom to reappoint.            Johnson interviewed Day\nand Hollowell, among the rest, questioning Day about intake and staffing,\nand Hollowell about intake and the felon release.             Johnson also conferred\nwith his new chief deputy Danny Bradley and his operations major Skipper\nPolk, Johnson's long-time colleagues in the North Little Rock Police\nDepartment (NLRPD).     Bradley opposed rehiring Day and Hollowell based on\nmedia accounts of the jail’s turmoil and because local police told Bradley\nthey had lost confidence in the two men.          Polk, who had recently worked for\nthe county prosecutor, also advised against keeping Day and Hollowell based\non Hollowell's felon release and on Day’s low regard by the prosecutor's\noffice and local law enforcement.      Johnson also spoke with Lowell Kincaid,\nwho served as planning coordinator for the new jail.                Kincaid had\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fobserved Day's leadership when Kincaid worked with the transition committee\nDay chaired.      Based on what he saw, Kincaid told Johnson that Day was not\nan effective administrator.\n\n\n       On December 12, 1994, Johnson informed Day and Hollowell they would\nnot be reappointed to their posts.         After taking office on the first of\nJanuary, Johnson followed through on his campaign promise to put a\nprofessional administrator in charge of the new jail by appointing Kincaid\nto the newly created position of chief of detention operations.             Neither\nDay nor the district court questioned Kincaid’s qualifications for this\nposition.    Jail conditions improved under Kincaid's leadership:       intake was\nrestored    to    its   intended   purposes,   disciplinary   proceedings   against\ndisruptive inmates declined, and the jail’s failures in transporting\ninmates to court were eliminated.\n\n\n       Johnson made very few personnel moves when he took office.           Out of\na staff of roughly 350 under departing Sheriff Gravett, Johnson rejected\nonly four:       Day, Hollowell, and two whites, Gravett’s chief deputy and a\nlieutenant who opposed Johnson for sheriff.           Four other employees left\nvoluntarily, all of them white.         Day and Hollowell were the only blacks\nwhom Johnson did not reappoint.         Johnson transferred Captain Talley, who\nis black and who had moved to the enforcement division when Hollowell took\nover intake, back to detention.          Johnson also promoted two deputies to\nlieutenant, both black.        Although Johnson inherited a Department with a\ndetention division that historically has employed a higher proportion of\nblacks than enforcement, neither Day nor Hollowell contended, nor did the\ndistrict court find, that the Department’s racial composition reflected\nrace   discrimination.       Johnson's employment decisions have left that\ncomposition virtually undisturbed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f        Johnson testified he rejected Day because Day mismanaged the intake\narea and left staff positions unfilled.      As the district court put it,\nJohnson’s \"bottom line\" was that he “did not have confidence that Day would\nmanage in the way Johnson wanted.\"   Johnson testified he rejected Hollowell\nbecause Hollowell's felon release showed poor judgment, and also because\nof intake conditions and inmate transportation failures.     Summarizing his\nreasons, Johnson said he decided not to reappoint Day and Hollowell based\non \"job performance and the perception of that job performance\" by the\npublic.    In keeping with Johnson’s stated reasons, the district court found\nthe new jail was “chaotic” and understaffed, with a “deplorable” intake\narea that posed “a security risk.”      The district court also found that\ninmates were “delivered to court late,” and acknowledged that Johnson\ngenuinely believed Hollowell's felon release was not \"an exercise in good\njudgment.\"    Notwithstanding these vivid findings, the district court found\nrace was the real reason Day and Hollowell lost their jobs.\n        We review the district court's finding of intentional discrimination\nfor clear error.

Reviewing\nthe evidence relied on by the district court, we conclude Day and Hollowell\nfailed to present sufficient circumstantial evidence for the district court\nreasonably to infer that Johnson's stated reasons were a coverup for racial\ndiscrimination.\n     To begin with, the district court was clearly mistaken in its view\nthat Johnson was too poorly informed to make an honest assessment of Day's\nand Hollowell's job performances.           The district court made light of\nJohnson’s reliance on news accounts despite its recognition that the jail’s\nproblems were thoroughly aired in media reports that Day and Hollowell\nnever challenged.     Johnson was also informed by “general talk in the\ncommunity,” which included the opinions of local police officers and\nprosecutors, sources public employers like Johnson may rely on.         See Waters\nv. Churchill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676 (1994).       Johnson also made his own first-\nhand observations at the jail, which he visited several times and for\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fseveral hours at a time.    Bolstered by the district court’s finding that\nintake was in a “chaotic” and “deplorable” state, what Johnson saw during\nhis visits would be enough reasonably to convince an observer in Johnson’s\nposition that the jail’s management had failed.      Additionally, the topics\nJohnson raised in Day's and Hollowell's interviews--intake, staffing, and\nthe felon release--show Johnson was well aware of the jail's problems in\ntheir areas of responsibility.\n     The district court believed Johnson's failure to discuss Day's and\nHollowell's qualifications with Sheriff Gravett undermined the plausibility\nof Johnson's nondiscriminatory explanation.         We disagree.      Johnson was\nentitled to put little stock in what Gravett might say about Day’s and\nHollowell’s current job performances because Johnson could evaluate their\nperformances   himself.    Further,     Gravett's   assessment   of    Day's   and\nHollowell's work histories sheds no light on whether Johnson honestly based\nhis employment decisions on their job performances at the new jail.            See\nDey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673826\"><a href=\"/opinion/673826/anne-dey-v-colt-construction-development-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1460 (7th Cir. 1994).            The\ndistrict court also felt Johnson’s reasons for rejecting Day were “too\nbroad to withstand scrutiny” because Johnson blamed Day for things beyond\nDay's control, like overcrowding and staff turnover.       The district court\nis mistaken.   Johnson blamed Day only for problems Day knew were coming and\nfailed to resolve.   As the district court found, \"everyone involved with\nthe planning of the new jail anticipated that it would be overcrowded,\" and\n\"[s]taff turnover was also expected.\"    Likewise, Hollowell knew about these\nproblems before he took over intake and transportation, and he was unable\nto deal with the problems despite his forewarning.          Johnson was also\njustified in relying on Hollowell’s release of unbailable felons into the\ncommunity as a reason for rejecting him.            The district court found\nJohnson’s reliance was pretextual because Sheriff Gravett condoned the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\frelease and Hollowell apologized and promised never to do it again.                  The\nfocus of the pretext inquiry is Johnson’s motivation, however, and neither\nGravett’s approval nor Hollowell’s promises cast any doubt on the sincerity\nof Johnson’s belief that Hollowell had shown bad judgment.\n\n\n     According to the district court, the \"most telling\" evidence of\npretext was Johnson's appointment of three whites to the top posts in his\nadministration.       Although the district court recognized Johnson had the\nright to hire anyone he wanted for these policymaking positions, which are\nexempt from Title VII under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f), the district court found\npretext because Day and Hollowell have better resumes than the appointed\nwhites, Chief Deputy Bradley, Major Polk, and Major Scarborough.                 Day and\nHollowell are captains and have earned four-year college degrees, but\nJohnson’s top three officers have not graduated from college, and only one,\nBradley, had made captain in the NLRPD.          Contrary to the district court's\nview, comparing resumes is meaningless because Day and Hollowell were not\ncandidates    for   any   of   the   positions   Bradley,    Polk,     and   Scarborough\nreceived.    Disparate treatment of black and white employees who are not\nsimilarly situated is not evidence of pretext.            See McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804 (1973); Harvey v.

Besides, there is powerful evidence that Day and\nHollowell mismanaged the jail despite their fine resumes.\n     Although Johnson made approximately 350 employment decisions when he\ntook office, the district court believed Johnson’s treatment of one black\nofficer,    Captain    Talley,    was   \"probative   of    Johnson's    discriminatory\nattitude.\"    Johnson moved Talley back to detention without asking him if\nhe wanted to move, but Johnson asked a white captain who had no experience\nin the new jail, Jimmy White, if he wanted to remain in his current\nposition and left him\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthere.     Setting aside that Talley and White were not similarly situated,\nthe    district    court’s   concern   about    Talley   is   misplaced   because     any\ndisparate treatment of Talley is irrelevant to Day's and Hollowell's\nclaims.        See Swapshire v. Baer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516986\"><a href=\"/opinion/516986/48-fair-emplpraccas-1439-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38615-robert-swapshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 (8th Cir. 1989).\nAlthough Talley preferred to stay in enforcement, we see nothing amiss in\nJohnson’s decision to move Talley back to an administrative position in\ndetention to shore up the jail’s troubled operation.              Talley experienced\nthe jail’s failures when carrying out Day’s directions, which he disagreed\nwith, before Day appointed Hollowell to head intake.             Having promised the\nvoters he would solve the jail’s problems, Johnson needed the steadying\nhand of competent leadership at the jail, and Johnson's choice of Talley\nfor a top jail position strikes us as a vote of confidence.\n       The district court found more evidence of Johnson’s discriminatory\nattitude in a career-path policy Johnson established after he took office.\nBecause Johnson considers the Department’s enforcement and detention\ndivisions as separate career paths requiring different skills and training,\nJohnson wants to minimize cross-divisional transfers to take advantage of\nthe expertise that comes with extended experience within a division.\nWithout addressing this race-neutral reason, the district court took the\nview    that    Johnson’s    policy   will   “lock   African-Americans    in   what    is\nconsidered by some as . . . less desirable position[s] in detention,” which\n“traditionally has had a larger percentage of African-American employees”\nthan enforcement.      The record does not support the district court’s view,\nhowever.       In the first place, Johnson’s career-path policy is irrelevant\nto Day’s and Hollowell’s claims because it was not adopted until after\nJohnson decided against their reappointment.             Besides, Johnson inherited\nthe racial imbalance from his predecessors, and Day and Hollowell never\nalleged, nor did the district court find, any racial discrimination in the\nhiring practices of the earlier sheriffs.            Also, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fdistrict court is mistaken that blacks are “lock[ed]” into detention\n“without the opportunity to work in enforcement.”                  In uncontradicted\ntestimony, Johnson made clear that under his policy, deputies in detention\nremain free to apply for available positions in enforcement (and vice\nversa), they receive preference over outsiders, and they switch divisions\nwithout loss of salary or seniority.          They may have to start anew to earn\nrank only because their expertise in the division they left does not\nnecessarily qualify them to exercise command in their new division.\nAlthough the district court’s findings do not reveal who feels jobs in\ndetention are “less desirable” or why, those views shed no light at all on\nJohnson’s attitude.         Actually, the district court’s findings about the\nsorry state of affairs in the jail drive home the importance of a program\nthat encourages stable careers in detention.\n\n\n     Finally, the district court found evidence of pretext in Johnson’s\nconferences with \"white friends,\" appointees Kincaid, Bradley, and Polk,\nbefore rejecting Day and Hollowell.                The district court erroneously\nbelieved Johnson’s appointees lacked \"personal knowledge\" about Day and\nHollowell and thus found their advice “suspect.”            But Kincaid worked with\nDay on the new jail’s transition committee.          Bradley and Polk knew all they\nneeded   to   know   from    news   reports   of    the   jail’s   turmoil   and   from\nconversations with local police officers:           Day and Hollowell were running\na failed operation.    Moreover, the reasons Johnson gave for rejecting Day\nand Hollowell were not concocted with the after-the-fact help of so-called\n\"white friends\" because Johnson promised to make changes at the jail during\nhis campaign for election, and neither Day and Hollowell nor the district\ncourt suggest Johnson’s campaign was racially motivated.               Additionally,\nthere is no evidence that Johnson or his appointees ever made disparaging\nremarks about\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fanyone’s race, and the mere fact Johnson's closest advisors are white does\nnot render their advice \"suspect.\"\n\n\n       Even though Day and Hollowell failed to discredit the legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory     reasons   motivating    Johnson’s   rejection        of   Day   and\nHollowell, the district court felt it was \"incredible\" Johnson would reject\nveteran, well-educated employees with years of satisfactory service in the\nDepartment.    Thus, declaring Day and Hollowell \"competent captain[s],\" the\ndistrict court ordered Johnson to place them in unspecified positions \"at\nthe captain level.\"    Because there is a difference between performing a job\nand holding a rank, a court applying Title VII must ask whether the job\napplicant was qualified for a particular available position, not whether\nthe applicant is an otherwise deserving rankholder.           See Burdine, 450 U.S.\nat 253.    No doubt Day and Hollowell advanced in rank over the years because\nthey   ably handled the positions their increasing rank progressively\nentitled them to fill.    They failed, however, to measure up to their most\nrecent assignments, and rank earned through satisfactory performance in\nother positions does not insulate them from the consequences of failure in\ntheir positions at the new jail.           The district court’s strongly held\nfeeling that Johnson should have paid attention to Day’s and Hollowell’s\npositive    past   accomplishments   “is     nothing   more    than   an    attack     on\n[Johnson’s] judgment [about] how [he] chose to evaluate [Gravett’s]\nemployees.”    Hutson v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702366\"><a href=\"/opinion/702366/68-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1209-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43739-james-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 780 (8th Cir.\n1995).    As we said of the reduction-in-force selection in Hutson, “[t]here\nis nothing inherently discriminatory” in Johnson’s reliance on Day’s and\nHollowell’s recent failures in deciding whether he would include them in\nhis administration.     Id.\n       Although the district court faults Johnson for not considering Day\nand Hollowell for other positions, Day and Hollowell never\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fshowed interest in any other specific positions, suggested bumping other\ncaptains in their favor, or indicated their willingness to accept demotions\nso they might fill lesser positions.        Johnson did not discriminate against\nDay and Hollowell when he did not consider them for positions they did not\nseek.    See Tart v. Levi Strauss & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516238\"><a href=\"/opinion/516238/48-fair-emplpraccas-1104-49-empl-prac-dec-p-38754-mabel-tart-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (8th Cir. 1988).\nAlthough we understand the district court’s disappointment that Day and\nHollowell lost their jobs, federal courts are not self-appointed personnel\nmanagers, and they may not second-guess the fairness or wisdom of an\nemployer’s nondiscriminatory employment decisions.          See Aucutt v. Six Flags\nOver Mid-America, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719642\"><a href=\"/opinion/719642/michael-aucutt-v-six-flags-over-mid-america-inc-a-missouri-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1317 (8th Cir. 1996); Harvey, 38 F.3d\nat 973.\n\n\n        The district court's Title VII findings are also flawed because the\ndistrict court failed to draw another inference we find inescapable from\nthe record.     See Arkansas State Police, 10 F.3d at 552.             In its wide-\nranging    search   for   hints   of   pretext,   the   district   court   overlooked\nsubstantial evidence that, job performances aside, Johnson rejected Day and\nHollowell for political reasons.        Assuming Day and Hollowell did the best\nanyone could do under the circumstances at the new jail, the situation\nlooked bad, and they paid the political price for being in the wrong place\nat the wrong time.         Johnson acknowledged he was concerned about the\npublic’s perception of their job performance.               Viewing the facts as\nsympathetically to Day and Hollowell as we can, Day and Hollowell emerge\nas political scapegoats, forced out by Johnson to make good on his campaign\npledge.    In sum, we are convinced Day and Hollowell lost their jobs because\nthey either were or seemed to be responsible for the tangled situation at\nthe new jail, but not because of their race.\n        We turn now to the district court's judgment for Hollowell on his\n§ 1983 free speech claim.         In 1979, the District Court for the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fEastern District of Arkansas assumed jurisdiction over the old Pulaski\nCounty jail under the terms of a consent decree.         About a month after the\nnew jail opened, the district court contacted Hollowell and asked about\njail conditions.    The district court found Hollowell communicated with the\ndistrict court as part of his duties as the Department’s public information\nofficer and at the direction of Sheriff Gravett.              During Hollowell's\nemployment interview, Johnson told Hollowell he disfavors federal court\noversight of the new jail.     The district court believed Johnson's view was\na reasonable one, and recognized as well that neither “[S]heriff [Gravett]\n[n]or    anybody   else”   wanted   federal    supervision.   Johnson   also   told\nHollowell he disagreed with Hollowell's having gone to the district court.\nWhen Johnson gave Hollowell notice he would not be retained, Hollowell felt\nJohnson was retaliating against him for speaking to the court.                  The\ndistrict court agreed.\n\n\n        A public employee's speech enjoys limited protection under the First\nAmendment.     See Connick v. Myers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (1983).            Whether\nHollowell's speech was protected is a question of law we review de novo.\nSee Mumford v.

Because\nHollowell spoke to the district court on orders from his superior and as\nthe Department's public information officer, not as a concerned citizen,\nwe conclude Hollowell's speech was not protected.              See Bausworth v.\nHazelwood Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600802\"><a href=\"/opinion/600802/mary-bausworth-v-hazelwood-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1198-99 (8th Cir. 1993).            Although\nHollowell’s conversation with the district court about jail conditions was\nnot put into evidence, we glean from the record that Hollowell’s report\nleft no doubt about the dismal situation at the new jail, which Hollowell\ndid nothing to make better and made even worse through his felon release.\nConsequently, even if Hollowell's speech were protected, his failings as\nhead of intake and transportation convince us Johnson would have rejected\nhis job candidacy anyway.

Although the court acknowledged that\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      I concur in the majority opinion with respect to the\nplaintiffs’ section 1983 free speech claim.\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe new facility was severely overcrowded, there was evidence that neither\nplaintiff was solely responsible for the problems at the jail.        The court\nfound that Day and Hollowell attempted to address the problems, but that\nthey were met with lack of cooperation from other county officials and\ndelay caused by the lawsuit over control of the jail.              Particularly\nHollowell, who was not even in charge of intake at the jail until after the\nconditions were publicized, could not be considered responsible for the\nproblems at the jail. The district court also found the circumstances\nsurrounding Johnson’s decision not    to retain Day and Hollowell suspicious:\nJohnson knew very little about either Day or Hollowell when he decided not\nto retain them and he replaced them with white men whose experience and\nqualifications paled in comparison to those of Day and Hollowell.        Having\nrejected Johnson’s proffered reasons for his employment decisions and\nfinding   the   circumstances   surrounding   those   decisions   indicative   of\ndiscriminatory intent, the district court’s ultimate finding of intentional\ndiscrimination was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                   CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f</pre>",
