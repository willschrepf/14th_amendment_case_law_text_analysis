Background\n\n       Grady signed an agreement to be placed on the waiting list to enter the prison’s\n\nsubstance abuse treatment program. A year later, he entered the program. While\n\nenrolled in the program, he did not make any formal complaints concerning his health or\n\nhis inability to complete the program other than to inform staff he was dyslexic and\n\nbeginning treatment for Hepatitis C.\n\n       Less than six weeks after entering the program, Grady informed David Booth, the\n\nprison’s alcohol and drug program supervisor, he wanted to quit the program. Grady told\n\nBooth he would hurt someone if he was not allowed to leave the program. Grady also\n\nnoted his various medical conditions and advanced age (65) and claimed he was “too\n\nemotionally unstable” to be in the program. (R. at 338.)\n\n       Grady’s withdrawal from the program triggered a restricted privileges (RP) status\n\nreview. (R. at 347 (“A restricted privileges (RP) status review shall be initiated for any\n\n[CDOC] offender who refuses to participate in, or is terminated from, a [CDOC]\n\nsanctioned . . . treatment program to which the offender is assigned.”).) The review\n\nresulted in his placement on RP status, which prohibited him from having a television\n\nand radio in his cell and attending recreation with the general prisoner population. His\n\ncanteen privileges were also restricted. He filed an internal prison appeal challenging his\n\nplacement on RP status. The decision was affirmed and he remained on RP status for\n\n105 days.\n\n                                            -2-\n\f       Grady filed this case against Booth, Tania Garcia, the treatment program’s clinical\n\nsupervisor, and Wesley Wilson, the chairman of the classification committee which\n\nplaced him on RP status.1 He asserted an Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual\n\npunishment claim and a Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against defendants in\n\nboth their official and individual capacities. He claimed prison officials forced him to\n\nparticipate in the treatment program as a punitive response to the grievances he filed\n\nseeking treatment for his Hepatitis C. He alleged that while enrolled in the treatment\n\nprogram, he was subjected to intimidation, degradation, sleep deprivation, fear, stress and\n\nabuse by other inmates. Grady claimed these conditions led to the deterioration of his\n\nvarious medical conditions including degenerative bone disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and\n\nHepatitis C. He said he told Booth the program was exacerbating his medical conditions\n\nand asked him to release him from the program, but Booth refused to discuss the issue.\n\nGrady also claimed defendants knew he could not complete the program yet forced him\n\nto participate and then automatically punished him, i.e., reclassified him to RP status,\n\nwhen he could not complete the program. He alleged his reclassification to RP status\n\n(which he claimed is akin to administrative segregation) violated due process because it\n\nwas non-grievable and resulted in atypical and significant hardship on him.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Grady also named Aristedes W. Zavares, the CDOC’s Executive Director, Dana\nBustos, the CDOC’s Mental Health Clinical Director, Kevin Millyard, the prison’s\nwarden, and Carl Soares, the prison’s assistant warden, as defendants. These individuals\nwere dismissed due to Grady’s failure to demonstrate their personal participation in any\nalleged constitutional violation. Grady does not challenge here their dismissals.\n\n                                            -3-\n\f       Defendants moved for summary judgment. In a cogent and comprehensive order,\n\nthe district court granted the motions.\n\n                                            II. Discussion\n\n       The district court concluded the Eleventh Amendment barred Grady’s claims\n\nagainst defendants in their official capacities because he did not seek prospective relief\n\nbut rather monetary damages and a declaratory judgment that defendants violated his\n\nrights. See Buchwald v. Univ. of N.M. Sch. of Med., 159 F.3d 487, 494-95 & n.3 (10th\n\nCir. 1998) (Eleventh Amendment bars claims against individual defendants in their\n\nofficial capacities if relief sought is monetary damages or a declaration that defendants\n\nviolated plaintiff’s rights in the past).\n\n       With regard to the claims against defendants in their individual capacities, the\n\ncourt rejected Grady’s Eighth Amendment claim because his conclusory allegations of\n\ndegradation, humiliation, fear, sleep deprivation, intimidation, and his physical and\n\nemotional inability to complete the treatment program “are not sufficiently serious to\n\nestablish an Eighth Amendment claim, as they are not extreme risks resulting in the\n\ndenial of the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.” (R. at 1175.) See Farmer\n\nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) (for conditions of confinement to violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment, they must be “sufficiently serious”; they “must result in the denial of the\n\nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities”) (quotations omitted). Moreover, there\n\nwas no evidence supporting Grady’s claim he had been abused by other inmates. The\n\ncourt also rejected Grady’s due process claim because the temporary (105 days)\n\nconditions of his confinement as a result of RP status—no television and radio in is cell\n\n                                               -4-\n\fand loss of canteen privileges and recreational time with the general prison population—\n\ndid not constitute an “atypical and significant” hardship when compared to the ordinary\n\nincidents of prison life. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995) (holding a\n\ndeprivation occasioned by prison conditions or a prison regulation is not a liberty interest\n\nprotected by due process unless it imposes an “atypical and significant hardship on the\n\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life”). Indeed, because prison policy\n\nsubjects all inmates who refuse to participate in an assigned treatment program to RP\n\nstatus, it can hardly be said to be “atypical.” See Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corrs., 165\n\nF.3d 803, 809 (10th Cir. 1999) (in determining whether the government has imposed an\n\natypical and significant hardship on the plaintiff in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life, we consider “the duration and degree of plaintiff’s restrictions as compared\n\nwith other inmates”) (emphasis added).\n\n          We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. Garcia v. City\n\nof Albuquerque, 232 F.3d 760, 765 (10th Cir. 2000). Even construing Grady’s pro se\n\npleadings liberally, see Firstenberg v. City of Santa Fe, N.M., 696 F.3d 1018, 1024 (10th\n\nCir. 2012), we agree, for the reasons given by the district court, no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact existed and defendants were entitled to judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)\n\n(“The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.”).\n\n          AFFIRMED. We DENY Grady’s request to proceed without prepayment of the\n\nfiling fees because he has failed to advance “a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the\n\n                                             -5-\n\flaw and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.” DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, 937\n\nF.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991).
