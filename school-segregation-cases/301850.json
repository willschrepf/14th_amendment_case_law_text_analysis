Hall et al., 5 Cir., 287 F.2d 376. The contentions, (1) that this action is a suit against the State, and (2) that it fails to state a cause of action because the State of Louisiana has adopted a pupil placement law, are fully dealt with there, as they have been previously. There is no profit in belaboring them further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same may be said as to the appeal of the intervenor whose petition to intervene as the parent of white children was denied by the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, too, the appellants contend that the posture of the case was such that the motion for summary judgment, which was granted at the same time as that in the St. Helena case, was not appropriate because there were fact issues that required a full trial. Not only is this contention answered by the undisputed fact that the defendant was continuing to operate the schools of its parish in accordance with the state laws then on the statute books, which required racially segregated schools, but here there was the following testimony of the parish school superintendent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. * * * You are in a general way familiar with the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States did issue a decree which said substantially that racial segregation in public education in the United States is unlawful &#8212; you are generally familiar with that?

City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed. 2d 1058, and Harrison v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L. Ed.2d 1152. The obvious answer to this contention is that we do not here construe the Louisiana Pupil Placement Law, LSA-R.S. 17:101 et seq. We hold merely that whatever assignments may be made by the parish school board whether under a state pupil placement law, if held valid, or under any other policy of transfer or admission, the race or color of the pupil can not be a factor entering into such assignment. We have already dealt with such contention in the order denying motion for rehearing in the third appearance of Orleans Parish School Board v. Bush, 5 Cir., 268 F.2d 78, where on page 80 we said, \"It is only when the federal court is called on to interpret such state statute or rule on its constitutionality that the rule (of abstention) applies.\" Also, we said there, \"No conceivable construction of the state statute can affect this result in the slightest degree.\" No ground for abstention exists here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in the contention that the trial court erred in not requiring the National Association for Advancement of Colored People to become a party to the suit. It was in no sense an indispensable party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contention that the trial court erred in not invoking a three judge district court is without substance under the holding of the Bush case that there is no substantial constitutional question presented by the complaint. Moreover, no state statute was ruled on by the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
