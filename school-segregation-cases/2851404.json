CBS producer\nRobert Vasilopulos testified that \"it was\nsimply a joke\" when he told Robert\nTutman, an African-American CBS\ncameraman, about a comedic movie called\nNiggers with Hats and parroted a phrase\nfrom the movie by telling Tutman to\n\"[g]et the fuck out of the office before\nI pop a cap in your ass.\" Tutman,\nhowever, viewed the comment as a serious\ndeath threat and lodged a formal\nharassment complaint with their employer\nWBBM-TV, Inc./CBS, Inc. (\"CBS\"). When CBS\nresponded by punishing Vasilopulos and\npromising to separate Vasilopulos from\nTutman at work, Tutman remained\ndissatisfied and eventually sued CBS\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,\n42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 2000e to 2000e-17. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment\nfor CBS on the hostile work environment\nand constructive discharge claims, and\nTutman appealed. We affirm summary\njudgment because CBS took prompt and\nappropriate remedial action to prevent\nfurther harassment and Tutman cannot\nestablish constructive discharge based on\nthe incident with Vasilopulos.\n\fI.   History\n\n  During the afternoon of Friday May 19,\n1995, Tutman was conversing with\nsportscaster Tim Weigel in the WBBM-TV\nsports office when CBS co-worker\nVasilopulos strolled into the office and\nsaid twice to Tutman, \"Get the fuck out\nof the office before I pop a cap in your\nass.\" According to Tutman, Vasilopulos\nbegan prancing around, derisively\ncaricaturing African-Americans. Surprised\nby Vasilopulos’s outburst, Tutman\nresponded that the correct phrase was\n\"bust a cap,\" not \"pop a cap.\"/1\nVasilopulos asked whether Tutman had seen\na movie entitled Niggers with Hats.\nTutman answered that movies like Niggers\nwith Hats were profitable and that\nVasilopulos should make a similar movie\nwith Tutman’s help. After two minutes,\nboth men departed the sports office.\n\n  However, Tutman later would testify that\nhe interpreted Vasilopulos’s outburst as\na racially-motivated death threat and was\nquite shaken by Vasilopulos’s\nhistrionics. After leaving the sports\noffice, he visited his supervisor Andrea\nJenkins and told her about Vasilopulos’s\nbizarre behavior. Jenkins assured him\nthat he had done well to notify her and\nthat she would investigate his complaint.\nTutman also called D.E. Simmons, an\noutside consultant retained by CBS to\nadvise on workplace concerns, and told\nhim about Vasilopulos. Simmons then\ncontacted Jenkins who asked Simmons to\nmeet with her at the office forthwith.\nThe pair discussed the situation, then\nimmediately reported Tutman’s complaint\nto News Director John Lansing. Lansing\ninvestigated further by speaking to\nWeigel and Vasilopulos that night about\nthe incident.\n\n  On Monday May 22, 1995, Tutman\ntelephoned CBS that he would not come to\nthe station for work because of the\nincident with Vasilopulos the previous\nFriday. CBS gave Tutman his work\nassignment over the telephone, but Tutman\ndid venture to the station that afternoon\nto meet with General Manager Robert\nMcGann about his complaint. Jenkins and\nLansing then briefed McGann about the re\nsults of their investigation thus far.\n  On Tuesday, McGann, Jenkins, Lansing,\nSimmons and Vasilopulos met to discuss\n\fVasilopulos’s version of events.\nAfterward, McGann informed the CBS human\nresources department about Vasilopulos’s\nconduct and Tutman’s complaint. On\nFriday, one week after the incident\nbetween Vasilopulos and Tutman, CBS’s\nDirector of Policy and Administration\nSandra Spangenberg arrived from CBS head\nquarters in New York to investigate\nfirsthand. After interviewing Tutman,\nVasilopulos and other witnesses,\nSpangenberg told Tutman that his\nallegation was serious and Vasilopulos’s\nobnoxious behavior would not be tolerated\nat CBS. Spangenberg told both Vasilopulos\nand Tutman that Vasilopulos would be\npunished.\n\n  Based on Spangenberg’s recommendations,\nCBS found that Vasilopulos posed no\nphysical threat to Tutman but had been\ngrossly inappropriate. CBS imposed a\ntripartite punishment on Vasilopulos: (1)\na written warning placed in his personnel\nrecord making clear that future\nmisconduct would lead to more serious\ndiscipline; (2) mandatory participation\nin a three-day interpersonal skills\nworkshop aimed at promoting better\nworkplace relationships; (3) Vasilopulos\nwas required to apologize to Tutman. In\naddition, CBS re-circulated its anti-\ndiscrimination and fair employment\npolicies to all employees. CBS previously\nhad disciplined Vasilopulos with letters\nof reprimand for yelling \"get the fuck\nout of my office\" at producer Howard\nDorsey and for using profanity in the\npresence of editor Debra Segal. However,\nat the time, Vasilopulos’s personnel file\ncontained no previous harassment\ncomplaints or disciplinary actions\nagainst him. Later, union official\nJessica Logan would testify that\nVasilopulos had disparaged CBS camera\ntechnician Morris Jones \"as a nigger\" in\nJune 1995, a month after CBS’s\ninvestigation of Vasilopulos’s harassment\nof Tutman, but Jones did not bring a\nformal charge against Vasilopulos.\n\n  Predictably, Vasilopulos was\nunenthusiastic about his punishment.\nVasilopulos balked at apologizing to\nTutman but understood that CBS was taking\nTutman’s complaint \"very seriously\" and\nwould terminate him if he did not comply.\nWith continued insistence by CBS,\nVasilopulos wrote a June 2, 1995, letter\naddressed to \"whom it may concern,\"\n\fexplaining noncommitally that he\nregretted \"that comments exchanged in a\njoking manner with Robert Tutman, on May\n19, 1995, were misinterpreted.\"\nVasilopulos also complained about\nattending the interpersonal skills\nworkshop taught by Simmons, and CBS\nallowed Vasilopulos instead to attend an\nalternative three-day sensitivity seminar\nfrom August 23 to August 25, 1995.\nVasilopulos managed to leave the final\nday of the program a few hours early.\n\n  Despite CBS’s response, Tutman refused\nto work because he felt \"unsafe.\" CBS\ntold Tutman that his assignments could be\ngiven by telephone and that he and\nVasilopulos could be given staggered\nshifts to ensure that he would not\nencounter Vasilopulos at work.\nNonetheless, CBS maintained that Tutman\nhad to report for work, and when Tutman\nremained intransigent, CBS placed Tutman\non a paid medical leave of absence. By\nhis admission, Tutman was happy to\ncollect salary without working and did\nnot object. However, CBS’s employment\npolicy limited medical leave to six\nmonths, and this edict had been strictly\nenforced without exception during the\nprevious ten years. As the expiration of\nTutman’s leave drew imminent, Tutman\ninsisted on additional paid leave so that\nhe could \"get back in shape\" but failed\nto provide a note from his doctor\nverifying that extended leave was\nmedically necessary. Indeed, Tutman\nadmits that he had not sustained a\nserious illness, and his doctors said\nthat there was no reason Tutman could not\nreturn to work. As a result, CBS\nconsidered Tutman \"voluntarily resigned\"\nwhen his six-month medical leave lapsed\non November 22, 1995.\n\n  Tutman filed a charge of discrimination\nwith the Illinois Department of Human\nRights and the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission that day. On July\n19, 1996, Tutman filed suit against CBS\nin district court alleging retaliation,\nracially hostile work environment and\nconstructive discharge under Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act. The district court\nreferred the case to Magistrate Judge\nMorton Denlow who recommended that the\ndistrict court grant summary judgment for\nCBS on all Tutman’s claims. On April 29,\n1999, the district court adopted the\nmagistrate’s recommendations and granted\n\fsummary judgment for CBS on all Tutman’s\nclaims. Tutman appeals summary judgment\non his hostile work environment and\nconstructive discharge claims.\nII. Analysis\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, drawing our\nown conclusions of law and fact from the\nrecord before us. See Haefling v. United\nParcel Serv., 169 F.3d 494, 497 (7th Cir.\n1999). Summary judgment is proper when\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\nsee also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). In determining\nwhether a genuine issue of material fact\nexists, we construe all facts in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving\nparty and draw all reasonable and\njustifiable inferences in favor of that\nparty. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).\n\nA.  Hostile Work Environment\n  Tutman’s central claim before the\ndistrict court was that he suffered a\nracially hostile work environment, based\non the Vasilopulos incident, in violation\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. For\nworkplace conduct to constitute a hostile\nwork environment actionable under Title\nVII, the harassment \"must be sufficiently\nsevere or pervasive ’to alter the\nconditions of [the plaintiff’s]\nemployment and create an abusive environment.’\"\nMeritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477\nU.S. 57, 65 (1986) (citation omitted).\nHowever, an employer is not strictly\nliable under Title VII for sexual\nharassment perpetrated by its employees.\nSee Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile\nCommunications, Inc., 957 F.2d 317, 320\n(7th Cir. 1992). In hostile work\nenvironment cases, the employer can avoid\nliability for its employees’ harassment\nif it takes prompt and appropriate\ncorrective action reasonably likely to\nprevent the harassment from recurring.\nSee Saxton v. American Tel. & Telegraph\nCo., 10 F.3d 526, 535 (7th Cir. 1993).\nThe district court found that Tutman had\nestablished a genuine issue of material\nfact whether the Vasilopulos incident\ncreated a hostile work environment, but\n\fgranted summary judgment for CBS because\nit found that CBS had taken prompt,\neffective remedial action in response to\nthe incident. We do not decide whether a\nhostile work environment existed because\nthe question whether CBS took prompt and\neffective remedial action is dispositive\nhere.\n\n  CBS responded promptly to Tutman’s\nharassment complaint. CBS began\ninvestigating Tutman’s allegation on the\nday of the incident, and CBS’s general\nmanager interviewed both Tutman and\nVasilopulos on the next work day. Within\ntwo weeks, CBS had completed its\ninvestigation and sanctioned Vasilopulos\nby issuing him a letter of reprimand,\nsending him to sensitivity training and\ncommanding him to apologize to Tutman.\nWhen Tutman would not return to work, CBS\noffered to arrange his and Vasilopulos’s\nwork schedules so that they would have no\ncontact with each other at work.\n  Tutman argues that CBS’s response was\ninsufficiently punitive given the\nseverity of Vasilopulos’s conduct on May\n19, 1995. However, the question is not\nwhether the punishment was proportionate\nto Vasilopulos’s offense but whether CBS\nresponded with appropriate remedial\naction reasonably likely under the\ncircumstances to prevent the conduct from\nrecurring. See Saxton, 10 F.3d at 535. By\npunishing Vasilopulos and promising to\nsegregate Vasilopulos from Tutman at\nwork, CBS made it distinctly improbable\nthat Vasilopulos would further harass\nTutman because the two men would have\nsuch limited contact, if any, with each\nother at work. In Saxton, the employer\neffectively responded to the plaintiff’s\nreport of sexual harassment by\ntransferring the harasser to a different\ndepartment because the transfer \"served\nto terminate all contact between [the ha\nrasser] and [the plaintiff] and bring a\ndefinitive end to any harassment.\"\nSaxton, 10 F.3d at 536. Similarly, in\nSavino v. C.P. Hall Co., 199 F.3d 925,\n933 (7th Cir. 1999), the employer’s\nrelocation of the harasser to a different\nfloor than the plaintiff, in response to\nher harassment complaint, constituted\neffective remedial action likely to\nprevent recurrence of harassment.\nLikewise here, separating Vasilopulos and\nTutman made it quite unlikely that\nVasilopulos would harass Tutman again.\n\f  Of course, if separating Vasilopulos and\nTutman at work would have disadvantaged\nTutman, CBS’s response would have been\ninadequate because remedial action that\nmakes the victim worse off is ineffective\nper se. See Guess v. Bethlehem Steel\nCorp., 913 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1990).\nHowever, Tutman has not established that\nhe would have been injured by CBS’s\nproposed response. CBS has several sports\nproducers other than Vasilopulos, so\nTutman would not have been precluded from\nworking sports assignments. Tutman also\nintroduced no evidence that rearranging\nhis work schedule would have forced him\nto relinquish his union stewardship.\n\n  In addition to dissociating Vasilopulos\nfrom Tutman, CBS warned Vasilopulos\nsternly that CBS would not tolerate\nfurther harassment of co-workers. CBS\nreprimanded Vasilopulos, sent him to\nsensitivity training and ordered him to\napologize to Tutman. Vasilopulos\nboorishly refused to attend the assigned\nsensitivity training seminar before\nacquiescing to a different program, from\nwhich he arranged to exit early.\nVasilopulos also resisted apologizing to\nTutman and ultimately penned an\nunconvincing, three-sentence missive only\nafter continued insistence by CBS\nmanagement. We sympathize with Tutman’s\nfrustration over Vasilopulos’s\nrecalcitrance, but Title VII does not\nrequire that CBS punish Vasilopulos\ncommensurately to his conduct. The key\nhere is that CBS responded promptly with\nremedial action reasonably calculated to\nend Vasilopulos’s harassment of Tutman by\nmaking clear to Vasilopulos that further\nharassment would result in termination\nand credibly promising Tutman that he\nwould have no contact with Vasilopulos at\nwork.\n\n  Alternatively, Tutman offers the novel\nclaim that CBS is liable under Title VII\nfor its failure to prevent Vasilopulos\nfrom racially harassing him despite prior\nindications that made harassment\nforeseeable. Namely, Tutman points to\nother instances of verbal abuse by\nVasilopulos--incidents of yelling at CBS\nemployees Howard Dorsey, Debra Segal and\nMorris Jones. Without deciding the\nviability of a Title VII claim for\nfailure to prevent foreseeable workplace\nharassment, we find that CBS could not be\nreasonably expected to have prevented\n\fracial harassment here. Tutman alleges\nonly a single racial harassment incident-\n-Vasilopulos allegedly called Jones a\n\"nigger\"--of which CBS might have been\naware, and that incident occurred in June\n1995, after Vasilopulos’s harassment of\nTutman and Tutman’s departure from CBS.\nUnder these facts, CBS was not forewarned\nbefore May 19, 1995, that it should have\ndone more to prevent Vasilopulos from\nengaging in racial harassment.\n\nB.   Constructive Discharge\n\n  To establish a claim for constructive\ndischarge under Title VII, a plaintiff\nmust prove that his working conditions\nwere so intolerable as a result of\nunlawful discrimination that a reasonable\nperson would be forced into involuntary\nresignation. See Vitug v. Multistate Tax\nComm’n, 88 F.3d 506, 517 (7th Cir. 1996).\nWorking conditions for constructive\ndischarge must be even more egregious\nthan the high standard for hostile work\nenvironment because \"in the ’ordinary’\ncase, an employee is expected to remain\nemployed while seeking redress.\" See\nDrake v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 134\nF.3d 878, 886 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n  Tutman refused to return to work after\nVasilopulos harassed him, but a\nreasonable employee would not have found\nwork conditions at CBS to be so\nintolerable that he would have to quit\nhis job. In fact, Tutman did not claim at\nthe time that he could not return to work\nafter his medical leave expired. Instead,\ndespite the absence of medical\ncorroboration, Tutman requested extended\nleave to get back into shape. Aside from\nTutman’s bare assertions, there is little\nto suggest that Tutman’s working\nconditions would have been so objectively\nintolerable based on the lone incident\nwith Vasilopulos. In cases finding\nconstructive discharge, the plaintiffs\nsuffered from much more severe and\nsustained harassment. See, e.g., Snider\nv. Consolidation Coal Co., 973 F.2d 555,\n558 (7th Cir. 1992); Taylor v. Western &\nS. Life Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 1188, 1191\n(7th Cir. 1992); Sanchez v. Denver Pub.\nSch., 164 F.3d 527, 534 (10th Cir. 1998).\nIn Taylor, we found constructive\ndischarge when the plaintiffs’ boss\nconstantly peppered the plaintiffs with\nracist comments, brandished a pistol and\nheld it to one plaintiff’s head. Taylor,\n\f966 F.2d at 1191. In Brooms v. Regal Tube\nCo., 881 F.2d 412, 417, 423 (7th Cir.\n1989), the plaintiff established\nconstructive discharge where \"repeated\ninstances of grossly offensive conduct\nand commentary\" culminated with an\nincident during which a co-worker showed\nthe plaintiff a racist pornographic\nphotograph, told her that she was hired\nto perform the task depicted in the\nphotograph, grabbed the plaintiff and\nthreatened to kill her. A credible death\nthreat that signals grave danger to the\nplaintiff’s bodily integrity, as in\nTaylor and Brooms, can constitute grounds\nfor finding constructive discharge, but\nthe harassment suffered by Tutman at\nVasilopulos’s hands falls well short of\nthis standard.\n\n  A reasonable person would not have\nfeared Vasilopulos as a result of his\nsingle oblique threat, even construing\nall reasonable inferences in favor of\nTutman, such that he would feel forced to\nresign. See, e.g., Drake, 134 F.3d at\n887; Rabinovitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 489\n(7th Cir. 1996); Saxton, 10 F.3d at 537.\nIn Simpson v. Borg-Warner Automotive,\nInc., 196 F.3d 873, 877-78 (7th Cir.\n1999), a co-worker’s comment that\n\"someone should take a dish and knock\n[the plaintiff] upside the head\" did not\nestablish constructive discharge.\nLikewise, in Lindale v. Tokheim Corp.,\n145 F.3d 953, 956 (7th Cir. 1998),\n\"boorish behavior\" by co-workers was\ninsufficient for constructive discharge.\nVasilopulos’s harassment of Tutman was\ncloser to the abuse suffered in these\ncases than to the vicious harassment in\nBrooms or Taylor. Even assuming that\nVasilopulos’s harassment was so offensive\nand severe to create a hostile work\nenvironment, his conduct was not so egre\ngious as to compel Tutman’s resignation\nand establish constructive discharge.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n/1   The parties agree that \"bust a cap\" and \"pop a\ncap\" means \"to shoot\" in gang parlance, but CBS\nmaintains that Vasilopulos did not intend his\nremark as a death threat. Vasilopulos and Tutman\nappear to have been referring to the film Fear of\n\fa Black Hat mistakenly as Niggers with Hats.\n\f",

Later, union official\nJessica Logan would testify that\nVasilopulos had disparaged CBS camera\ntechnician Morris Jones \"as a nigger\" in\nJune 1995, a month after CBS’s\ninvestigation of Vasilopulos’s harassment\nof Tutman, but Jones did not bring a\nformal charge against Vasilopulos.\n\n  Predictably, Vasilopulos was\nunenthusiastic about his punishment.\nVasilopulos balked at apologizing to\nTutman but understood that CBS was taking\nTutman’s complaint \"very seriously\" and\nwould terminate him if he did not comply.\nWith continued insistence by CBS,\nVasilopulos wrote a June 2, 1995, letter\naddressed to \"whom it may concern,\"\n\fexplaining noncommitally that he\nregretted \"that comments exchanged in a\njoking manner with Robert Tutman, on May\n19, 1995, were misinterpreted.\"\nVasilopulos also complained about\nattending the interpersonal skills\nworkshop taught by Simmons, and CBS\nallowed Vasilopulos instead to attend an\nalternative three-day sensitivity seminar\nfrom August 23 to August 25, 1995.\nVasilopulos managed to leave the final\nday of the program a few hours early.\n\n  Despite CBS’s response, Tutman refused\nto work because he felt \"unsafe.\" CBS\ntold Tutman that his assignments could be\ngiven by telephone and that he and\nVasilopulos could be given staggered\nshifts to ensure that he would not\nencounter Vasilopulos at work.\nNonetheless, CBS maintained that Tutman\nhad to report for work, and when Tutman\nremained intransigent, CBS placed Tutman\non a paid medical leave of absence. By\nhis admission, Tutman was happy to\ncollect salary without working and did\nnot object. However, CBS’s employment\npolicy limited medical leave to six\nmonths, and this edict had been strictly\nenforced without exception during the\nprevious ten years. As the expiration of\nTutman’s leave drew imminent, Tutman\ninsisted on additional paid leave so that\nhe could \"get back in shape\" but failed\nto provide a note from his doctor\nverifying that extended leave was\nmedically necessary. Indeed, Tutman\nadmits that he had not sustained a\nserious illness, and his doctors said\nthat there was no reason Tutman could not\nreturn to work. As a result, CBS\nconsidered Tutman \"voluntarily resigned\"\nwhen his six-month medical leave lapsed\non November 22, 1995.\n\n  Tutman filed a charge of discrimination\nwith the Illinois Department of Human\nRights and the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission that day. On July\n19, 1996, Tutman filed suit against CBS\nin district court alleging retaliation,\nracially hostile work environment and\nconstructive discharge under Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act. The district court\nreferred the case to Magistrate Judge\nMorton Denlow who recommended that the\ndistrict court grant summary judgment for\nCBS on all Tutman’s claims. On April 29,\n1999, the district court adopted the\nmagistrate’s recommendations and granted\n\fsummary judgment for CBS on all Tutman’s\nclaims. Tutman appeals summary judgment\non his hostile work environment and\nconstructive discharge claims.\nII. Analysis\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, drawing our\nown conclusions of law and fact from the\nrecord before us. See Haefling v. United\nParcel Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762157\"><a href=\"/opinion/762157/jack-m-haefling-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 497 (7th Cir.\n1999). Summary judgment is proper when\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.\" Fed.

In determining\nwhether a genuine issue of material fact\nexists, we construe all facts in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving\nparty and draw all reasonable and\njustifiable inferences in favor of that\nparty. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (1986).\n\nA.  Hostile Work Environment\n  Tutman’s central claim before the\ndistrict court was that he suffered a\nracially hostile work environment, based\non the Vasilopulos incident, in violation\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. For\nworkplace conduct to constitute a hostile\nwork environment actionable under Title\nVII, the harassment \"must be sufficiently\nsevere or pervasive ’to alter the\nconditions of [the plaintiff’s]\nemployment and create an abusive environment.’\"\nMeritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111712\"><a href=\"/opinion/111712/meritor-savings-bank-fsb-v-vinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1986) (citation omitted).\nHowever, an employer is not strictly\nliable under Title VII for sexual\nharassment perpetrated by its employees.\nSee Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile\nCommunications, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578257\"><a href=\"/opinion/578257/anna-m-juarez-v-ameritech-mobile-communications-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320\n(7th Cir. 1992). In hostile work\nenvironment cases, the employer can avoid\nliability for its employees’ harassment\nif it takes prompt and appropriate\ncorrective action reasonably likely to\nprevent the harassment from recurring.\nSee Saxton v. American Tel. & Telegraph\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658153\"><a href=\"/opinion/658153/marcia-l-saxton-v-american-telephone-and-telegraph-company-successor-to/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (7th Cir. 1993).\nThe district court found that Tutman had\nestablished a genuine issue of material\nfact whether the Vasilopulos incident\ncreated a hostile work environment, but\n\fgranted summary judgment for CBS because\nit found that CBS had taken prompt,\neffective remedial action in response to\nthe incident. We do not decide whether a\nhostile work environment existed because\nthe question whether CBS took prompt and\neffective remedial action is dispositive\nhere.\n\n  CBS responded promptly to Tutman’s\nharassment complaint. CBS began\ninvestigating Tutman’s allegation on the\nday of the incident, and CBS’s general\nmanager interviewed both Tutman and\nVasilopulos on the next work day. Within\ntwo weeks, CBS had completed its\ninvestigation and sanctioned Vasilopulos\nby issuing him a letter of reprimand,\nsending him to sensitivity training and\ncommanding him to apologize to Tutman.\nWhen Tutman would not return to work, CBS\noffered to arrange his and Vasilopulos’s\nwork schedules so that they would have no\ncontact with each other at work.\n  Tutman argues that CBS’s response was\ninsufficiently punitive given the\nseverity of Vasilopulos’s conduct on May\n19, 1995. However, the question is not\nwhether the punishment was proportionate\nto Vasilopulos’s offense but whether CBS\nresponded with appropriate remedial\naction reasonably likely under the\ncircumstances to prevent the conduct from\nrecurring. See Saxton, 10 F.3d at 535. By\npunishing Vasilopulos and promising to\nsegregate Vasilopulos from Tutman at\nwork, CBS made it distinctly improbable\nthat Vasilopulos would further harass\nTutman because the two men would have\nsuch limited contact, if any, with each\nother at work. In Saxton, the employer\neffectively responded to the plaintiff’s\nreport of sexual harassment by\ntransferring the harasser to a different\ndepartment because the transfer \"served\nto terminate all contact between [the ha\nrasser] and [the plaintiff] and bring a\ndefinitive end to any harassment.\"\nSaxton, 10 F.3d at 536. Similarly, in\nSavino v. C.P. Hall Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767161\"><a href=\"/opinion/767161/karen-savino-v-cp-hall-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n933 (7th Cir. 1999), the employer’s\nrelocation of the harasser to a different\nfloor than the plaintiff, in response to\nher harassment complaint, constituted\neffective remedial action likely to\nprevent recurrence of harassment.\nLikewise here, separating Vasilopulos and\nTutman made it quite unlikely that\nVasilopulos would harass Tutman again.\n\f  Of course, if separating Vasilopulos and\nTutman at work would have disadvantaged\nTutman, CBS’s response would have been\ninadequate because remedial action that\nmakes the victim worse off is ineffective\nper se. See Guess v. Bethlehem Steel\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547530\"><a href=\"/opinion/547530/53-fair-emplpraccas-1547-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40251-juanita-guess-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (7th Cir. 1990).\nHowever, Tutman has not established that\nhe would have been injured by CBS’s\nproposed response. CBS has several sports\nproducers other than Vasilopulos, so\nTutman would not have been precluded from\nworking sports assignments. Tutman also\nintroduced no evidence that rearranging\nhis work schedule would have forced him\nto relinquish his union stewardship.\n\n  In addition to dissociating Vasilopulos\nfrom Tutman, CBS warned Vasilopulos\nsternly that CBS would not tolerate\nfurther harassment of co-workers. CBS\nreprimanded Vasilopulos, sent him to\nsensitivity training and ordered him to\napologize to Tutman. Vasilopulos\nboorishly refused to attend the assigned\nsensitivity training seminar before\nacquiescing to a different program, from\nwhich he arranged to exit early.\nVasilopulos also resisted apologizing to\nTutman and ultimately penned an\nunconvincing, three-sentence missive only\nafter continued insistence by CBS\nmanagement. We sympathize with Tutman’s\nfrustration over Vasilopulos’s\nrecalcitrance, but Title VII does not\nrequire that CBS punish Vasilopulos\ncommensurately to his conduct. The key\nhere is that CBS responded promptly with\nremedial action reasonably calculated to\nend Vasilopulos’s harassment of Tutman by\nmaking clear to Vasilopulos that further\nharassment would result in termination\nand credibly promising Tutman that he\nwould have no contact with Vasilopulos at\nwork.\n\n  Alternatively, Tutman offers the novel\nclaim that CBS is liable under Title VII\nfor its failure to prevent Vasilopulos\nfrom racially harassing him despite prior\nindications that made harassment\nforeseeable. Namely, Tutman points to\nother instances of verbal abuse by\nVasilopulos--incidents of yelling at CBS\nemployees Howard Dorsey, Debra Segal and\nMorris Jones. Without deciding the\nviability of a Title VII claim for\nfailure to prevent foreseeable workplace\nharassment, we find that CBS could not be\nreasonably expected to have prevented\n\fracial harassment here. Tutman alleges\nonly a single racial harassment incident-\n-Vasilopulos allegedly called Jones a\n\"nigger\"--of which CBS might have been\naware, and that incident occurred in June\n1995, after Vasilopulos’s harassment of\nTutman and Tutman’s departure from CBS.\nUnder these facts, CBS was not forewarned\nbefore May 19, 1995, that it should have\ndone more to prevent Vasilopulos from\nengaging in racial harassment.\n\nB.   Constructive Discharge\n\n  To establish a claim for constructive\ndischarge under Title VII, a plaintiff\nmust prove that his working conditions\nwere so intolerable as a result of\nunlawful discrimination that a reasonable\nperson would be forced into involuntary\nresignation. See Vitug v. Multistate Tax\nComm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721358\"><a href=\"/opinion/721358/joselito-vitug-v-multistate-tax-commission-dan-r-bucks-as-executive/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (7th Cir. 1996).\nWorking conditions for constructive\ndischarge must be even more egregious\nthan the high standard for hostile work\nenvironment because \"in the ’ordinary’\ncase, an employee is expected to remain\nemployed while seeking redress.\" See\nDrake v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751140\"><a href=\"/opinion/751140/larry-d-drake-and-rosalie-e-drake-v-minnesota-mining-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 886 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n  Tutman refused to return to work after\nVasilopulos harassed him, but a\nreasonable employee would not have found\nwork conditions at CBS to be so\nintolerable that he would have to quit\nhis job. In fact, Tutman did not claim at\nthe time that he could not return to work\nafter his medical leave expired. Instead,\ndespite the absence of medical\ncorroboration, Tutman requested extended\nleave to get back into shape. Aside from\nTutman’s bare assertions, there is little\nto suggest that Tutman’s working\nconditions would have been so objectively\nintolerable based on the lone incident\nwith Vasilopulos. In cases finding\nconstructive discharge, the plaintiffs\nsuffered from much more severe and\nsustained harassment. See, e.g., Snider\nv. Consolidation Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589729\"><a href=\"/opinion/589729/sharon-snider-v-consolidation-coal-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n558 (7th Cir. 1992); Taylor v.

Taylor,\n\f966 F.2d at 1191. In Brooms v. Regal Tube\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527046\"><a href=\"/opinion/527046/helen-brooms-cross-appellee-v-regal-tube-company-copperweld-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417, 423 (7th Cir.\n1989), the plaintiff established\nconstructive discharge where \"repeated\ninstances of grossly offensive conduct\nand commentary\" culminated with an\nincident during which a co-worker showed\nthe plaintiff a racist pornographic\nphotograph, told her that she was hired\nto perform the task depicted in the\nphotograph, grabbed the plaintiff and\nthreatened to kill her. A credible death\nthreat that signals grave danger to the\nplaintiff’s bodily integrity, as in\nTaylor and Brooms, can constitute grounds\nfor finding constructive discharge, but\nthe harassment suffered by Tutman at\nVasilopulos’s hands falls well short of\nthis standard.\n\n  A reasonable person would not have\nfeared Vasilopulos as a result of his\nsingle oblique threat, even construing\nall reasonable inferences in favor of\nTutman, such that he would feel forced to\nresign. See, e.g., Drake, 134 F.3d at\n887; Rabinovitz v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721544\"><a href=\"/opinion/721544/martin-rabinovitz-v-honorable-federico-pena-secretary-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489\n(7th Cir. 1996); Saxton, 10 F.3d at 537.\nIn Simpson v.

Even assuming that\nVasilopulos’s harassment was so offensive\nand severe to create a hostile work\nenvironment, his conduct was not so egre\ngious as to compel Tutman’s resignation\nand establish constructive discharge.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n/1   The parties agree that \"bust a cap\" and \"pop a\ncap\" means \"to shoot\" in gang parlance, but CBS\nmaintains that Vasilopulos did not intend his\nremark as a death threat. Vasilopulos and Tutman\nappear to have been referring to the film Fear of\n\fa Black Hat mistakenly as Niggers with Hats.\n\f</pre>",
