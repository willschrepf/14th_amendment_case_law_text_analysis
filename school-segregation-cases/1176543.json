State of Texas, et al., Civil Action No. 1424, Marshall Division, requiring <i>inter alia</i> that the Texas Education Agency, the State Commissioner of Education and their officers, agents, employees, successors reevaluate all of their activities and practices relating to the desegregation of public elementary and secondary education within the State of Texas; upon completion of this re-evaluation the defendants were required to file a plan stating specific actions which they would take pursuant to their affirmative obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. On January 15, 1971, the defendants filed their plan. Plaintiffs filed a response to this plan on February 1, 1971, incorporating both objections to defendants' plan and recommendations for what the defendants were legally required to accomplish by this plan. An evidentiary hearing was held on February 1 and 2, 1971. A further hearing was held in Tyler on April 12, 1971, the case then, and hereafter, being styled Civil Action No. 5281, Tyler Division.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has carefully considered the submissions of the respective parties and the evidence presented at the hearings, in light of the defendants' affirmative duty to take \"whatever steps might be necessary to * * * [eliminate] racial discrimination * * * root and branch.\" Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-438, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1694, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). In this regard the duty of the state appears to be two-fold: <i>First,</i> to act at once to eliminate by positive means all vestiges of the dual school structure throughout the state; and <i>second,</i> to compensate for the abiding scars of past discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the State of Texas, Dr. J. W. Edgar, Commissioner of Education of the State of Texas, the Texas Education Agency, their officers, agents, employees, successors and all other persons in active concert or participation with them (hereinafter referred to as defendants) shall fulfill those duties as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Student Transfers</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Defendants shall not permit, make arrangement for or give support of any kind to student transfers, between school districts, when the cumulative effect in either the sending or receiving school or school district will be to reduce or impede desegregation, or to reinforce, renew, or encourage the continuation of acts and practices resulting in discriminatory treatment of students on the ground of race, color, or national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The Texas Education Agency shall review all student transfers and shall notify the sending and receiving districts promptly of all transfers which do not appear to comply with the terms of this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) If, after receiving notice of the Texas Education Agency's refusal to approve transfers, the receiving district shall continue to accept the transfer of students, or if the sending district shall refuse to provide suitable educational opportunities for these students, defendants, after 15 days notice to the President of the Board of Trustees and the Superintendent (if the district has such an official), shall refuse to transfer the funds, based on the average daily attendance of the transfer students involved to the account of the receiving district, and shall, thereby, terminate and refuse to grant or continue paying to the offending district a percentage of state funds equivalent to the district's entitlement based on the average daily attendance of the students transferring in violation of this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Defendants shall also refuse to distribute to the offending district any transportation funds which might accrue on account of transfer students accepted in violation of this Order. If the offending district continues to refuse to deny transfers which adversely affect desegregation, the Texas Education Agency shall warn the district that its accreditation status is in danger. This warning shall remain in effect for ten days, at which time, if the offending district has failed to correct its violations, the Texas Education Agency shall suspend the district's TEA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Changes in School District Boundaries</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Defendants shall not permit, make arrangements for, approve, acquiesce in, or give support of any kind to changes in school district boundary lines &#8212; whether by detachment, annexation, or consolidation of districts in whole or in part &#8212; which are designed to, or do in fact, create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color, or national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Defendants shall require the board of trustees of any school district desiring to annex or consolidate with a nearby district, in whole or in part, or desiring to change its boundaries in any other manner such as is described, for example, in Part II-A(2) of the Court's Order of November 24, 1970, to report said intention to the Commissioner of Education for the State of Texas at least 15 days prior to the effective date of such action, and shall take appropriate measures to insure compliance with this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Whenever the Commissioner shall receive notice that a district or a portion of a district is to be detached from, annexed to, or consolidated with another district, he shall institute an immediate investigation as to the effects of such projected change of boundaries on the desegregation status of all of the school districts concerned. He shall promptly notify the appropriate county and local officials of his findings, and indicate whether or not the transfer of territory is in violation of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) If county and local officials proceed to consummate the transfer of territory after being notified that they are in violation of the law, defendants, after 15 days notice to the President of the Board of Trustees and the Superintendent of the district (if the district has such an official), shall refuse to transfer funds, based on the average daily attendance of the students in the territory detached, annexed or consolidated, to the account of the new district, and shall, thereby, terminate and refuse to grant or continue paying to the offending district a percentage of state funds equivalent to the district's entitlement based on the average daily attendance of the students detached, annexed or consolidated in violation of this Order. These funds shall be distributed to the remainder of the original district, in cases of illegal detachments, but shall not be used by that district to support the education of children living in the detached area. In cases involving the consolidation of whole districts, the Texas Education Agency shall hold the funds derived from the average daily attendance of the students illegally annexed to or consolidated with the new district in escrow pending dissolution of the illegal transfer of territory and the return of students to their original districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Defendants are enjoined from granting \"incentive aid\" payments pursuant to Texas law (Art. 2815-4, Vernon's Ann. Texas Revised Civil Statutes as amended), to districts which are enlarged by annexations or consolidation actions in violation of this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Should a county board of education or a school district, having received notice from the Commissioner that a territorial alteration has been disapproved, fail to disavow the action and to declare its effects null and void, the Texas Education Agency shall notify the district that its accreditation status is in danger. This notice shall remain in effect for 10 days, at the end of which time, if the offending district has failed to correct its violations, the Agency shall suspend the district's TEA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) In all cases involving annexation or consolidation of school districts, the Texas Education Agency shall apply the portions of the Order of the Court in this case dated April 19, 1971, concerning the annexation of nine all-black school districts to nearby bi-racial districts, and specifically, the portions of that Order relating to faculty and staff and to bi-racial committees, to the newly enlarged districts and shall require the said district to submit to the Texas Education Agency such reports as may be necessary to enable that Agency to determine whether the newly enlarged district is operating and will continue to operate in compliance with Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>School Transportation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Defendants shall not permit, make arrangement for, acquiesce in, or give support of any kind to bus routes or runs which are designed to, or do in fact, create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color, or national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The transportation system in those county units and school districts having transportation systems shall be completely re-examined each year by the Texas Education Agency. Bus routes and runs as well as the assignment of students to buses will be designed to insure the transportation of all eligible pupils on a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory basis. Bus routes and runs shall be constituted to provide that each bus operated by a district picks up every pupil along the route or run who is assigned to the school or schools and grade levels served by that bus. Where two or more equally efficient and economical routes or runs are available in a given area of the school district, the route or run which would promote or facilitate desegregation of buses shall be adopted by the district and approved by the Texas Education Agency rather than a route or run which, whether by intent, inaction, or inadvertence, would maintain or encourage segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Accordingly, if upon examination of transportation systems, the Texas Education Agency shall find that a district is operating one or more bus routes or runs which serve 66% or more students of a minority group, which are duplicated by one or more routes or runs serving more than 66% students of another race or ethnic background, the Texas Education Agency shall immediately investigate and determine whether the heavily minority routes or runs may be re-routed, terminated or combined with routes or runs which serve non-minority students so as to desegregate these routes or runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) If the Texas Education Agency finds that a county or local district is operating its transportation system in violation of this Order, it shall notify the appropriate officials of the local district. If the offending district refuses to alter its bus routes or runs so as to avoid segregation in instances where the Texas Education Agency has determined that such alterations are necessary, or if such a district persists in operating bus routes or runs which adversely affect the desegregation of its schools, classes, or extra-curricular activities, the Texas Education Agency shall refuse to approve the entire route structure of the district, and shall, thereby, terminate and refuse to grant or continue paying state transportation funds to the offending district until it shall have altered all routes or runs operated in violation of this Order, so as to eliminate all vestiges of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. In addition, the Texas Education Agency shall notify the district that its accreditation status is in danger. This notice shall remain in effect for 10 days, at which time, if the offending district has failed to correct its violations, the Agency shall suspend the district's TEA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Extra-Curricular Activities</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Defendants shall not permit, make arrangement for, acquiesce in or give support of any kind to activities run in connection with the elementary and secondary educational program operated by the state or any of its county and local educational agencies which, whether by intent, inaction, or inadvertence, results in segregation or other discrimination against students on the ground of race, color, or national origin. These extra-curricular activities include, but are not limited to, student government organizations, athletic teams for inter-scholastic competition, clubs, hobby groups, student newspaper staffs, annual staffs, band, band majorettes and cheerleaders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The Texas Education Agency shall instruct the members of its accreditation review teams in conjunction with its Title IV staff, to examine the extra-curricular activities of each district which they review. All violations of this Order which are discovered by such investigations shall be reported to the Commissioner of Education. If the Texas Education Agency receives complaints from any source that a school district is operating and supporting extracurricular activities in violation of this Order, immediate investigation shall be made of such complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) If the Commissioner finds that a district is operating and supporting extra-curricular activities in violation of this Order, he shall notify the county or local school district through the President of its Board of Trustees and through the Superintendent (if the district has such an official), that the district is operating in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fourteenth Amendment. At the same time, he shall warn the district that its accreditation is in danger. This warning shall remain in effect for 10 days, at which time, if the district has failed to correct the violations, the Texas Education Agency shall suspend the district's TEA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) In addition to the suspension of the accreditation of districts operating discriminatory extra-curricular activities, the State of Texas and the Texas Education Agency shall reduce the percentage of state funds granted to the district under the Minimum Foundation Program for salaries and operating expenses by ten per cent. Should the district persist in operating its extra-curricular activities in a manner which results in segregation or discriminatory treatment of students on account of race, color, or national origin, the State of Texas and the Texas Education Agency shall reduce the percentage of state funds as described above by an additional ten per cent. for each semester or term that the violations continue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Defendants are required to consider that a suspension or reduction of programs and activities to avoid operating them on a desegregated basis constitutes a violation of Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Faculty and Staff</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Defendants shall not permit, make arrangement for, acquiesce in or give support of any kind to the hiring, assigning, promoting, paying, demoting, reassigning or dismissing, or treatment of faculty and staff members who work directly with children in a discriminatory manner on account of race, color, or national origin. Defendants shall be responsible for the application and enforcement throughout the State of the provisions of the Order of the Court in this case dated April 19, 1971, referred to in Section 3, paragraph 7 herein, and specifically, the portions of that Order relating to the treatment of faculty and staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) In carrying out its affirmative duties under Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment in this area, the Texas Education Agency shall require each county or local educational agency desiring to receive state funds under the Minimum Foundation Program to include with its preliminary application for such funds a list of objective, nonracial and non-ethnic criteria by which the county or local district will measure its faculty and staff for assignment, promotion, demotion, reassignment or dismissal and by which it will judge prospective employees for faculty and staff positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The Texas Education Agency shall require the members of its accreditation review teams, in conjunction with the members of its staff designated to work in collaboration with the United States Office of Education to provide technical assistance to desegregating school districts pursuant to Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as \"Title IV staff\" or \"Title IV personnel\"), to examine the faculty and staff hiring and assigning practices of the districts which they visit for accreditation purposes, and to examine the records relating to hiring, assigning, promoting, paying, demoting, reassigning or dismissing of faculty and staff who work directly with children for a period including the three years prior to the complete elimination of the district's dual school structure. The review teams and state Title IV personnel shall also examine faculty assignments within each school district under review to determine whether the percentage of minority teachers in each school is substantially the same as the percentage of minority teachers in the school district as a whole, as required under Part II, Section A of the Order of this Court dated April 19, 1971, and referred to in Sections B(7) and E(1) herein.

Bus routes and runs as well as the assignment of students to buses will be designed to insure the transportation of all eligible pupils on a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory basis. Bus routes and runs shall be constituted to provide that each bus operated by a district picks up every pupil along the route or run who is assigned to the school or schools and grade levels served by that bus. Where two or more equally efficient and economical routes or runs are available in a given area of the school district, the route or run which would promote or facilitate desegregation of buses shall be adopted by the district and approved by the Texas Education Agency rather than a route or run which, whether by intent, inaction, or inadvertence, would maintain or encourage segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Accordingly, if upon examination of transportation systems, the Texas Education Agency shall find that a district is operating one or more bus routes or runs which serve 66% or more students of a minority group, which are duplicated by one or more routes or runs serving more than 66% students of another race or ethnic background, the Texas Education Agency shall immediately investigate and determine whether the heavily minority routes or runs may be re-routed, terminated or combined with routes or runs which serve non-minority students so as to desegregate these routes or runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) If the Texas Education Agency finds that a county or local district is operating its transportation system in violation of this Order, it shall notify the appropriate officials of the local district. If the offending district refuses to alter its bus routes or runs so as to avoid segregation in instances where the Texas Education Agency has determined that such alterations are necessary, or if such a district persists in operating bus routes or runs which adversely affect the desegregation of its schools, classes, or extra-curricular activities, the Texas Education Agency shall refuse to approve the entire route structure of the district, and shall, thereby, terminate and refuse to grant or continue paying state transportation funds to the offending district until it shall have altered all routes or runs operated in violation of this Order, so as to eliminate all vestiges of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. In addition, the Texas Education Agency shall notify the district that its accreditation status is in danger.

The review teams and state Title IV personnel shall also examine faculty assignments within each school district under review to determine whether the percentage of minority teachers in each school is substantially the same as the percentage of minority teachers in the school district as a whole, as required under Part II, Section A of the Order of this Court dated April 19, 1971, and referred to in Sections B(7) and E(1) herein.
