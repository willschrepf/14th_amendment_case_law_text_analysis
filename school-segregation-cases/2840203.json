BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs Steven Ondo and Jonathan Simcox\nwere arrested in their temporarily shared residence by Cleveland police officers on April 8, 2011,\non allegations of felonious assault on a police officer. The arrest occurred in the early morning\nwhen Plaintiffs were still in their boxer shorts, and police refused their demands to retrieve\nadditional clothing, instead issuing them jumpsuits at some point after Plaintiffs arrived at the\npolice station. Plaintiffs have repeatedly changed their stories since the arrest. And in this\ncase—the second lawsuit arising from the arrest—Plaintiffs allege that the officers violated their\nFourth Amendment rights by repeatedly striking them. Plaintiffs, who are homosexual, further\nclaim that the officers violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection\nClause by forcing them to remain in their boxer shorts. Plaintiffs also claim that several of these\nactions constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress under Ohio law. Most of these\nallegations were pleaded only against the officers as a group, and Plaintiffs did not amend their\npleadings as additional facts purportedly came to light. Instead, when Defendants moved for\nsummary judgment, Plaintiffs filed affidavits based upon “personal knowledge and belief” with\ntheir opposition to summary judgment, claiming specifically—for the first time—which officer\nallegedly committed each act. The district court granted Defendants’ motion to strike these\naffidavits, explaining that the court did not know which statements were based solely on personal\nknowledge, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and which statements were\nbased only upon belief. The district court then held that without those affidavits, the remaining\nrecord did not contain sufficient evidence to permit Plaintiffs’ claims to survive Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       We hold that whether to strike in whole or in part affidavits based upon “personal\nknowledge and belief” is within the sound discretion of the district court, and that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion here. We also hold that, construing in the light most favorable\nto Plaintiffs the record that remains without the affidavits, Defendants are entitled to judgment as\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.              Page 3\n\na matter of law because Plaintiffs’ arguments fail on the merits. We therefore AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                          I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                                                  A.\n\n       At approximately 2:00 AM on April 2, 2011, Steven Ondo and Jonathan Simcox were\nreturning home after several hours of drinking alcohol, and got into a heated argument outside\ntheir apartment building. A neighbor came out to confront them, at which time Simcox told him\nto “F*** off.”    An altercation ensued involving all three men, during which the neighbor\nidentified himself as an off-duty police officer. Later that night police came to Plaintiffs’ door\nand arrested them in their apartment. Plaintiffs spent two nights in jail and were treated for\nminor injuries. Several days later, arrest warrants were issued for Plaintiffs for felonious assault\non a police officer. On April 8, 2011, at 7:00 AM, SWAT Team officers with the Cleveland\nPolice Warrant Team arrived at Plaintiff’s apartment in Cleveland. This ten-man team comprises\neight patrol officers under the command of two senior officers, Lieutenant Timothy Gaertner and\nSergeant Daniel Galmarini. After entering Plaintiffs’ apartment building through the unlocked\nfront door, Officer William Johnson encountered Ondo in the stairwell, informed Ondo of the\narrest warrant, and handed Ondo to other officers to handcuff. Johnson then encountered Simcox\nin the stairwell, handcuffed him, and handed him over to other officers on the second floor.\nOndo and Simcox were both agitated and repeatedly asked why they were being arrested. The\nofficers then exited the building, keeping Plaintiffs on the lawn for several minutes as they\nprepared to load them into a paddy-wagon van to travel to the next warrant location.\n\n       Jesse Simcox—the brother of Jonathan—had been sleeping in Ondo’s apartment that\nnight and went downstairs to investigate the commotion, where he found officers and Plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs claim the officers were “pushing [them] around” and punched them repeatedly in the\nface, and repeatedly uttered anti-homosexual slurs. Plaintiffs allege that although the officers\nallowed Jesse Simcox to fetch shoes for Plaintiffs, the police denied Jesse Simcox the\nopportunity to get pants for them, and thus they were forced to go to jail in their underwear,\nbecause, as officers allegedly told them, “faggots don’t wear pants in jail.” Plaintiffs alleged a\nbarrage of slurs, such as one officer’s saying, “It’s a house full of fags here.” Plaintiffs originally\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.            Page 4\n\nalleged that they were forced “to wear only their underwear for over a day,” later changing their\nstory to claim they were not issued jumpsuits until after dinnertime. While in jail, neither\nPlaintiff requested or received any medical care, or made any medical report to jail staff.\nMoreover, no injuries are visible in Plaintiffs’ booking photos.\n\n       The police denied Plaintiffs’ allegations. Gaertner and Galmarini were never named as\ndefendants in the litigation, and insist that each Plaintiff, when detained, was immediately placed\nunder a supervisor’s observation and control.         Gaertner and Galmarini swore during their\ndepositions that at no time did they observe any mistreatment or slurs. Gaertner did not know\nanything about a request for pants, while Galmarini said he made the decision to keep Plaintiffs\nin their boxer shorts because Plaintiffs were agitated (though not resistant), and because the\nofficers were executing a warrant for the alleged assault of an officer, so the supervisors decided\nfor officers’ safety to remove Plaintiffs from the apartment setting and convey them to jail as\nquickly as possible. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims, their booking photos prove conclusively that\nthey were promptly issued jumpsuits once they arrived at the jail.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ initial arrest occurred on April 2, 2011, and the second arrest followed on April\n8, 2011. On January 18, 2012, Plaintiffs filed suit against the City of Cleveland and several of its\nofficers in federal district court, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their\nconstitutional rights, as well as various state law claims. Plaintiffs later filed an amended\ncomplaint that the district court dismissed on August 27, 2012, for failure to allege sufficient\nfacts to support the counts in the amended complaint. Among other things, the court held that\nPlaintiffs’ alleged facts did not satisfy the standard for municipal liability. On April 5, 2013,\nOndo and Simcox filed the current § 1983 suit against seventeen defendants: the City of\nCleveland, Officer Clifford Kime, Officer Tintlenot, Officer Cavanaugh, Officer Kean, Sergeant\nElias Diaz, Officer Park, Officer Livingston, Officer Rojas, Officer Freeman, Officer Crytzer,\nOfficer William Johnson, Officer Sanchez, Officer Toomey, Corrections Officer Dennis Barack,\nCorrections Officer Rowell, and Corrections Officer Robinson. On October 1, 2013, the court\ndismissed Kime from the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a). The court later\ndismissed Barack and Sanchez due to lack of proper service, dismissed Cavanaugh, Tintlenot,\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.             Page 5\n\nDiaz, and Kean under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and dismissed the City of\nCleveland on the basis of claim preclusion from the first lawsuit.\n\n       Of the remaining nine defendants, seven are members of the SWAT Team, and two are\ncorrections officers. The complaint includes claims brought under § 1983 for excessive force,\nviolation of privacy, failure to intervene, and denial of equal protection. It also includes two\nOhio state-law claims, one for intentional infliction of emotional distress and the other for\ninvasion of privacy.     On February 15, 2014, Defendants moved for summary judgment.\nPlaintiffs filed their opposition to summary judgment, including affidavits from Ondo and\nSimcox in which they identified with specificity which officers purportedly committed various\nacts. Defendants filed a motion to strike the affidavits because they were based on “personal\nknowledge and belief,” instead of personal knowledge exclusively.\n\n       On April 28, 2014, the district court granted Defendants’ motion to strike, and held that\nwithout the specific information in the affidavits, Plaintiffs’ allegations were insufficiently\nsupported by the remaining evidence in the record—which includes depositions from Plaintiffs,\nDefendants, other police officers, and Jesse Simcox, plus jail booking photos of Plaintiffs—to\ncreate a genuine issue of fact for a jury that the officers used excessive force or otherwise\nmistreated Plaintiffs.   Consequently, the court granted Defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment. This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       “We review a district court’s discovery-related rulings under the highly deferential abuse-\nof-discretion standard.” Loyd v. St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, 766 F.3d 580, 588 (6th Cir. 2014).\nThis includes our review of a district court ruling on a motion to strike an affidavit. Aerel, S.R.L.\nv. PCC Airfoils, LLC, 448 F.3d 899, 906 (6th Cir. 2006). A district court abuses its discretion\nwhen it “relies on erroneous findings of fact, applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies the\ncorrect legal standard when reaching a conclusion, or makes a clear error of judgment.” Reeb v.\nOhio Dep’t of Rehab. & Corr., 435 F.3d 639, 644 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. Tompkins v. Crown\nCorr, Inc., 726 F.3d 830, 837 (6th Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.            Page 6\n\ngenuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). The movant must show the district court that no genuine issue of material fact\nexists, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and drawing all\njustifiable inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor. Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d\n810, 817 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986);\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). There is a\ngenuine issue of material fact only if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The test is “whether the evidence\npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided\nthat one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Id. at 251–52. We affirm a grant of summary\njudgment “where the record as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-\nmoving party.” Cummings v. City of Akron, 418 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir. 2005) (citation, internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n       While the burden is initially on the moving party to show the absence of any genuine\nissues of material fact, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986), the nonmoving party\nmust then present “significant probative evidence” to “do more than show that there is some\nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts” to defeat the motion, Moore v. Philip Morris Cos.,\nInc., 8 F.3d 335, 340 (6th Cir. 1993).         The court may grant summary judgment if the\nnonmovant’s evidence is insufficiently probative to create a genuine issue of fact. Anderson,\n477 U.S. at 249–50. When the nonmovant does not effectively address the movant’s assertion of\na fact, the district court may “consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.” Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(e)(2).\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n       We must decide six issues in this appeal.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       First, we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion by granting\nDefendants’ motion to strike Plaintiffs’ affidavits, in which Plaintiffs swore that their assertions\nwere based on “personal knowledge and belief.” Affidavits defeat summary judgment only if\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 7\n\nthey are “made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\nshow that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c)(4). The district court held that Plaintiffs’ affidavits did not fulfill this requirement.\n\n        Plaintiffs make three points.          First, Plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding the words\ncontained in the affidavits, the context makes clear that Plaintiffs were making averments based\non personal knowledge only, not belief. Second, they say that courts are required in these\nsituations to segregate affidavits into those parts that are based upon personal knowledge, and to\nadmit those parts into evidence, while rejecting the remainder. And third, they contend that a\ncourt can reject the affidavit entirely only if it clearly contradicts other evidence in an attempt to\ncreate “sham facts.”\n\n        In 2009, we held that when an affidavit is partially admissible and partially inadmissible,\nthe district court must reject only those parts that are inadmissible. Upshaw v. Ford Motor Co.,\n576 F.3d 576, 593 (6th Cir. 2009). Also in Plaintiffs’ favor, the Fifth Circuit ruled that “magic\nwords” are not required to make explicit that an affiant’s declaration is based on personal\ntestimony and competence, holding that a court can conclude from the context of the declaration\nwhether those requirements are satisfied. DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, 420 F.3d 521, 530 (5th Cir.\n2005); accord Bryant v. Bell Atl. Md., Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 135 n.9 (4th Cir. 2002); Barthelemy v.\nAir Lines Pilots Ass’n, 897 F.2d 999, 1018 (9th Cir. 1990). However, district courts generally\nhave broad discretion regarding evidentiary rulings. District courts are even empowered to\nexclude evidence sua sponte. HDM Flugservice GmbH v. Parker Hannifin Corp., 332 F.3d\n1025, 1034 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n        We balanced these principles in an unpublished—and thus nonbinding1—opinion in\nTotman v. Louisville Jefferson County Metro Government, 391 F. App’x 454 (6th Cir. 2010),\nconcerning a person arrested on drug charges, who claimed that police used excessive force\nduring his detention.       Id. at 455.      Totman’s specific allegations regarding how the police\nphysically abused him are similar to Plaintiff’s allegations here, and are followed by similarly\nconflicting accounts offered during litigation, except that Totman indisputably suffered physical\n\n        1\n           “Unpublished decisions in the Sixth Circuit are, of course, not binding precedent on subsequent panels,\nbut their reasoning may be instructive or helpful.” Crump v. Lafler, 657 F.3d 393, 405 (6th Cir. 2011) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 8\n\ninjuries during his detention. See id. at 456–59. Totman’s statement included that he swore his\nassertions were “true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.”2 Id. at 464 (alterations\nomitted). We rejected the statement’s admissibility as evidence, holding that its allegations “go\nbeyond Totman’s personal knowledge and extend to matters within Totman’s belief,” and as\nsuch cannot be regarded as evidence giving rise to a genuine issue of material fact under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 56 to defeat summary judgment. Id. An affiant’s “statement . . . based\nupon his ‘belief’ . . . [does] not demonstrate the personal knowledge required by [Rule 56].”\nAlpert v. United States, 481 F.3d 404, 409 (6th Cir. 2007). Our affirming the district court’s\nsummary judgment for the defendants in Totman was further buttressed by the plaintiff’s lack of\ncertainty regarding precisely which officer committed each allegedly wrong act during the\nincident. See id. at 465.\n\n        This is an easier case than Totman. Here, as we explain below, there are clear factual\ndiscrepancies between the original complaint in the first lawsuit, subsequent complaints, the\naffidavits, and the admitted evidence. Some of Plaintiffs’ assertions here are either contradicted\nby the booking photos, or demonstrably false, such as the claim in their initial lawsuit that they\nwere forced to remain in their underwear throughout their entire detention and then forced to\nwalk home in their underwear, instead of being clothed in jumpsuits. In Totman, there were\nactual medical reports showing the plaintiff’s injuries, and the officer likely responsible had a\nhistory of excessive force. There are no such reports or evidence here—to the contrary, their\nbooking photos show no signs of injury or abuse—nor have Plaintiffs shown that the officers in\nquestion have a checkered history regarding the use of force. So while there was a significant\nfactual basis for the accounts of the Totman plaintiff, the same cannot be said of Plaintiffs’\naffidavits here.\n\n        “An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment]\nmust be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\nshow that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c)(4). “It must be remembered that when the moving party presents admissible evidence\n\n\n        2\n          It is of no moment that Totman’s statement was styled as a verified complaint, rather than an affidavit.\nThe same rule governs both types of submissions for purposes of defeating a motion for summary judgment. El Bey\nv. Roop, 530 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\fNo. 14-3527                    Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.           Page 9\n\njustifying a summary judgment if uncontradicted, the opposing party has the duty to show the\nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact.” 10B Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2738, at 345 (3d ed. 1998) (referencing Rule 56(e), the predecessor of Rule\n56(c)(4)). As part of this duty, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4) “limits the matter to be\nproperly included in an affidavit to facts, and the facts introduced must be alleged on personal\nknowledge. Thus, . . . statements made on belief or ‘on information and belief,’ cannot be\nutilized on a summary-judgment motion.” Id. at 345–46, 350–54 (footnotes omitted).\n\n        We hold that when affidavits based on knowledge and belief are submitted to support or\noppose a motion for summary judgment, the district court has discretion to determine whether it\ncan differentiate between knowledge and belief for each averment in the affidavit. If the court\ncan distinguish between the two, then, as was the case in Upshaw, the court should excuse the\naffiant’s stylistic error, and must admit the parts based solely upon personal knowledge, while\nstriking the parts based upon belief. If the court cannot differentiate between the two, then\nconsistent with the rationale in Wright & Miller, the court must strike the affidavit in its entirety,\nas in Totman. We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision on whether it could\ndistinguish between knowledge and belief for each of the affidavit’s averments, and thus whether\nto strike in part or to strike in toto.\n\n        The district court here found that it could not make those determinations regarding the\naffidavits filed by Ondo and Simcox, and so struck both affidavits in their entirety. We conclude\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n        We turn next to claims that arguably were abandoned at oral argument.                 During\nargument, Plaintiffs’ counsel, in responding to questions from the bench, conceded that without\nthe stricken affidavits, all of Plaintiffs’ claims would fail, raising the possibility that Plaintiffs\nwere abandoning the entirety of the remainder of their appeal. We note that most of the\naffidavits’ content concerned specific alleged incidents of excessive physical force, identifying\nindividual officers with individual acts. So as we address in some detail hereinafter, without the\naffidavits, Plaintiffs’ claims of excessive force and intentional infliction of emotional distress\ncannot survive summary judgment.\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.            Page 10\n\n       However, the equal-protection claim requires a closer look. We should not necessarily\nconstrue a single inartful or ill-advised verbal response from counsel as waiving anything more\nthan was directly at issue in the discussion at that time. Even in district court, where it is not\nuncommon for a claim to be dropped during litigation, we are not quick to declare that a claim\nhas been abandoned. See, e.g., Hayward v. Cleveland Clinic Found., 759 F.3d 601, 615–18 (6th\nCir. 2014). We are not aware of any case in which we have concluded, after full briefing, that\nPlaintiffs have completely abandoned every claim in their entire appeal based on a single verbal\nexchange during argument that did not include a clear and unequivocal surrender of all\nremaining issues. We are aware of the potentially chilling effect such a practice would have.\n\n       This issue is muddled by the inconsistency of Plaintiffs’ argument. In their complaint,\nPlaintiffs pleaded that by preventing them from wearing pants, the officers “treated [them]\ndifferently” because they are homosexual, and also that the police officers used “increased\nviolence and excessive force” against Plaintiffs and subjected them to “ridicule” and “called\nthem derogatory names, intended to humiliate them,” “because of their sexual orientation.”\nThese purportedly injurious acts, Plaintiffs allege, were inflicted upon them “because of their\nsexual preference” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiffs later cited among their\ncauses of action that their equal-protection rights were violated when they were treated\ndifferently in the course of actions that otherwise violated the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. Plaintiffs further elaborated upon these points when opposing Defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment, and the district court construed their argument as asserting that the\nofficers violated their equal-protection rights both by forcing them to remain in their underwear\nand by subjecting them to anti-homosexual slurs. On appeal, Plaintiffs’ principal brief makes\nclear their argument: “Plaintiffs do not contend that their constitutional rights to equal protection\nwere violated because the Defendants used homophobic slurs or because they had a\nconstitutional right to go to jail in particular clothing. Rather, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims\nare based on Defendants’ intentional decision to treat them differently simply because they are\ngay.” Yet in their reply brief, although at first they reiterate their broad argument by arguing that\nany state actions motivated by disapproval of homosexuality violate the Equal Protection Clause,\nthey then immediately reverse course, asserting that “Appellants are not claiming that being\ncalled [homophobic slurs] numerous times is an Equal Protection violation. They are also not\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.           Page 11\n\nclaiming that being told ‘faggots don’t get to wear pants to jail’ is an Equal Protection violation.”\nRather, Plaintiffs’ reply brief explains, “The act of . . . withholding pants from [them] only\nbecause they are gay is the violation.” Subsequently, at the relevant point during oral argument,\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, in discussing part of their equal-protection claim, seemed to recur to\nPlaintiffs’ initial appellate argument, separately arguing all three grounds to support their alleged\nequal-protection argument that they had raised in their principal brief: (1) that officers physically\nmistreated Plaintiffs because of their sexuality; (2) that officers required them to go for a\nprolonged period of time without proper clothing; and (3) that officers called them names.\n\n        During oral argument, one member of the panel posed this question to counsel for\nPlaintiffs regarding the equal-protection claim:      “Is it your view that if you strike all the\naffidavits there really is no evidence supporting the claim?” Counsel responded, “I do think that\nas a result of striking the affidavits the equal protection claim was also done away with.” That\njudge pressed further: “Properly. You have to have the affidavits to support either that claim or\nthe excessive force?” And counsel answered, “Yes.” The stricken affidavits consisted mostly of\nPlaintiffs’ asserting which individual defendant had engaged in which instance of mistreatment.\nWithout those affidavits, the record contains no evidence as to the identity of the officers who\nallegedly used excessive force against Plaintiffs. But Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim is not\ndependent on identifying any specific officer. The claim is that the police transported them\ninappropriately attired. It is true that the record on summary judgment contains Jesse Simcox’s\ndeposition testimony that the unidentified officer who allowed him to get shoes for Plaintiffs also\nprevented him from getting pants for them because “faggots don’t get to wear pants in jail.” The\nrecord also contains Officer Johnson’s deposition testimony that he talked to Jesse and asked him\nto help “find” Plaintiffs some shoes. And nowhere except in the affidavits did Plaintiffs even\nattempt to link those two pieces of testimony so as to identify Officer Johnson as having\ndelivered that single anti-homosexual slur. But the deposition evidence supports Plaintiffs’\nclaim that the officers on the scene transported Plaintiffs—wearing only their boxer shorts—to\njail.\n\n        In sum, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection argument was framed broadly, then narrowly, then\nbroadly again, then possibly abandoned altogether. The inconsistencies in Plaintiffs’ position are\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 12\n\nmanifest.    We will therefore consider their equal-protection claim only as their final brief\nrestated it, that the officers’ keeping them in their boxer shorts while transporting them to jail\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                                        C.\n\n        Regardless of our stance on abandonment, on the remaining record the equal-protection\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ keeping them in their underwear violates Plaintiffs’\nrights under the Equal Protection Clause, which requires that no State may “deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 4. The\ngeneral principle is that similarly situated persons should be treated alike. City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). More specifically as relevant here, the Equal\nProtection Clause “protects against invidious discrimination among similarly-situated individuals\nor implicating fundamental rights.” Scarbrough v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 470 F.3d 250,\n260 (6th Cir. 2006). When objecting to how police officers effectuate an arrest warrant in this\ncontext, “the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws\nis the Equal Protection Clause.” Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996), quoted in\nStemler v. City of Florence, 126 F.3d 856, 873 (6th Cir. 1997).3\n\n                                                        1.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that state actions involving homosexuals should trigger some form of\nheightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Heightened scrutiny is generally either\n“strict” or “intermediate.” State actions that treat individuals differently on the basis of a\nfundamental right trigger strict scrutiny. Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988). For years, the\nCourt held that a right is fundamental if it is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,” as\nevidenced by “whether this right is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”\nMcDonald v. City of Chi., 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010) (emphasis and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720–21 (1997) (providing a similar\n        3\n          Although Plaintiffs repeatedly asserted that the police allegedly uttered anti-homosexual statements, they\ncorrectly concede in their reply brief that the uttering of slurs or epithets by police officers—while completely\ninappropriate—is not unconstitutional. Williams v. Sandel, 433 F. App’x 353, 362 (6th Cir. 2011). “Name calling is\nnot a constitutional violation.” Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334, 1338 (8th Cir. 1985).\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.          Page 13\n\nformulation that the Supreme Court has occasionally employed in cases asserting unenumerated\nrights). Strict scrutiny requires the government to show that the challenged state action is\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling public interest. City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.\n\n       Strict scrutiny also applies to state actions that differentiate on the basis of a suspect\nclassification, of which the Supreme Court recognizes only three: race, Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 244, 270 (2003); alienage, Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371–72, 376 (1971); and\nnational origin, Oyama v. California, 332 U.S. 633, 644–46 (1948). State actions treating\nmembers of a quasi-suspect class differently from other persons trigger intermediate scrutiny,\nwhich requires the government to establish that the action is substantially related to achieving an\nimportant public interest. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976). The Court has recognized\ntwo such classifications: gender, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), and\nillegitimacy, Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U.S. 91, 98–99 (1982).\n\n       Equal-protection claims that neither implicate a fundamental right nor involve a suspect\nor quasi-suspect class require only rational-basis review. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631\n(1996); Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 693 (6th Cir. 2014).                Under that\ndeferential standard, the burden is on the challenger to show that the government’s action is not\nrationally related to any legitimate public interest. Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993).\nMany state actions burden some persons in a way that is different from the way they burden\nothers, and the Equal Protection Clause generally requires no more than a reasoned basis for such\ndiffering treatment in situations where foundational liberties and suspect criteria are not\nimplicated. Under rational-basis review, the government’s actions enjoy a “strong presumption\nof validity.” Id. at 319.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the state action of which they complain burdens a\nfundamental right. When the Supreme Court held that state laws against sodomy violate the Due\nProcess Clause, it did so using the language of rational-basis review, rather than any form of\nheightened scrutiny. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 574–78 (2003). The Court did not\nhold that the Constitution includes a fundamental right to homosexual conduct. Whether the\nCourt’s recent decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), recasts engaging in\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.          Page 14\n\nhomosexual acts as a fundamental right is irrelevant, because the decision by the police relevant\nhere does not impair Plaintiffs’ ability to engage in such conduct.\n\n       Nor can Plaintiffs establish that homosexuals are a suspect or quasi-suspect class. The\nCourt has never held that homosexuals satisfy the criteria for such classification. See Bowen v.\nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987) (discussing criteria for suspect or quasi-suspect\nclassification); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (same). The\nCourt has further explained that the rationale underlying these factors is that heightened scrutiny\nmay be justified if a group requires “extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political\nprocess.” Id. The Supreme Court has not recognized any new constitutionally protected classes\nin over four decades, and instead has repeatedly declined to do so. Moreover, the Court has\nnever defined a suspect or quasi-suspect class on anything other than a trait that is definitively\nascertainable at the moment of birth, such as race or biological gender.\n\n       In Obergefell, the Court was explicitly asked by the petitioners and various amici to\ndeclare that homosexuals are a specially protected class, and thus that government actions that\ndisfavor homosexuals are subject to heightened scrutiny. See Pet’r Br. at 38–49, Obergefell,\n135 S. Ct. 2584 (No. 14-556); see also, e.g., Brief of Amici Curiae GLMA et al. in Support of\nPet’rs passim, Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (No. 14-556). But the Court held only that the Equal\nProtection Clause was violated because the challenged statutes interfered with the fundamental\nright to marry, not that homosexuals enjoy special protections under the Equal Protection Clause.\nObergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2602–05.\n\n                                                 2.\n\n       We have always applied rational-basis review to state actions involving sexual\norientation. See Davis v. Prison Health Servs., 679 F.3d 433, 438 (6th Cir. 2012); Scarbrough,\n470 F.3d at 260–61; Stemler, 126 F.3d at 873–74. Under the law-of-the-circuit doctrine, an issue\ndecided by a panel of this court can be reconsidered only by the full court sitting en banc, or if\nthere has been a supervening decision by the Supreme Court. Darrah v. City of Oak Park,\n255 F.3d 301, 309 (6th Cir. 2001).        Plaintiffs have not offered any argument as to why\nheightened scrutiny should apply to state actions involving homosexuals, and indeed failed even\nto explore the relevant cases. And as we have already explained, Obergefell did not abrogate\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 15\n\nthose prior cases. We therefore have no basis for reviewing Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim on\nany basis more stringent than rational-basis review.\n\n        Applying the rational-basis test here, viewing the admitted evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Plaintiffs and drawing all inferences in their favor, we hold that a police officer’s\ndecision to keep Plaintiffs in their boxer shorts does not violate the Constitution. Plaintiffs have\nnot shown that our precedents recognize as an equal-protection violation the decision to keep\nsuspects in their current state of dress—including boxer shorts—so long as the person is attired\nsuch that his appearance is not obscene and the police officer provides an explanation that\nsatisfies the rational-basis test. Sergeant Galmarini’s explanation here of concern for officers’\nsafety—whether subjectively true or not—is presumed valid and rationally related to a legitimate\npublic interest. Therefore Plaintiffs’ grievance regarding being kept in their boxer shorts until\nthe police could issue them jumpsuits, even if motivated in part by sentiments regarding\nhomosexual behavior, still does not violate the Constitution.\n\n                                                        D.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ next claim is that the arresting officers used excessive force against them.4\n“The Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of excessive force by arresting and investigating\nofficers.”    Smoak v. Hall, 460 F.3d 768, 783 (6th Cir. 2006).                    Courts apply an objective\nreasonableness test when considering whether officers used excessive force, Graham v. Connor,\n490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989), which requires that we carefully balance the “nature and quality of the\nintrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing\ngovernmental interests at stake,” id. at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Ciminillo\nv. Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 466–67 (6th Cir. 2006). Such a test “is not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). Instead,\n\n        4\n           Plaintiffs muddle their argument by suggesting that officers’ using “increased violence” on account of\nPlaintiffs’ homosexuality is both an excessive-force violation and an equal-protection violation, but they cite no\nsupporting authority. Use of excessive force during a search or seizure is solely a Fourth Amendment violation,\nCiminillo v. Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 464–65 (6th Cir. 2006), an Amendment which applies to the States and their\npolitical subdivisions through the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 650–55 (1961). Once an\narrest ends, and a person in police custody transitions from arrestee to pretrial detainee, the Fourteenth Amendment\nthenceforth governs any excessive-force claims that arise during the pretrial detention. Kingsley v. Hendrickson,\n135 S. Ct. 2466, 2472–74 (2015); Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 n.10 (1989). But claims of excessive force\nin the context relevant here of an initial encounter with police is governed by the Fourth Amendment, and is not\nsomehow enhanced, or additionally sounding in the Fourteenth Amendment, because of police officers’ sentiments\nregarding homosexuality.\n\fNo. 14-3527                      Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                     Page 16\n\n“[t]hese factors are assessed from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene making a\nsplit-second judgment under tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances without the\nadvantage of 20/20 hindsight.” Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 473 (6th Cir. 2013); accord\nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396. The Supreme Court’s most recent decision in this area of law\nconfirms that this approach is correct, listing various non-exclusive factors a court may look to,\nKingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015), and then concluding that this “objective\nstandard adequately protects an officer who acts in good faith. . . stress[ing] that a court must\njudge the reasonableness of the force used from the perspective and with the knowledge of the\ndefendant officer,” id.5\n\n         When claiming damages for violations of constitutional rights, Plaintiffs “must allege,\nwith particularity, facts that demonstrate what each defendant did to violate the asserted\nconstitutional right.”       Lanman v. Hinson, 529 F.3d 673, 684 (6th Cir. 2008).                         Plaintiffs’\nexcessive-force claim consisted of nonspecific allegations that unnamed officers punched them\nrepeatedly, especially “in the face” or “in the nose.” In the absence of the affidavits, these\nallegations of physical mistreatment are not sufficiently specific under Lanman to withstand\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment. We note that following their first arrest on April 2,\nPlaintiffs sought and received medical care for the minor injuries they sustained during the fight\nwith the off-duty officer. But after the April 8 arrest, despite their allegations of repeated\nphysical strikes, Plaintiffs sought no medical treatment and made no report of such abuse.\nMoreover, no injuries are visible in their booking photos, which is especially significant given\nthat the only specific aspect of Plaintiffs’ allegations is that they were struck on their faces.\nPlaintiffs’ complaint and the discovery that was entered into evidence either attribute purported\nwrongful acts to the group as a whole, or to officers described in such general terms (e.g.,\nwearing glasses) as to foreclose attributing any one act to any one officer.                           Rather than\nattempting to amend their complaint, Plaintiffs waited eleven months, and only then submitting\naffidavits to augment these allegations in their opposition brief to Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment.           Because the district court was within its discretion in striking those\n\n         5\n          Much of Kingsley’s holding pertains only to due-process issues that arise in the context of operating a\ndetention facility, but the aspects cited here would apply to excessive-force claims against police officers regardless\nof whether the purported violation occurred during an arrest or during pretrial detention.\n\fNo. 14-3527                  Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.           Page 17\n\naffidavits, the allegations of physical mistreatment are therefore not supported by sufficient\nevidence to defeat summary judgment.\n\n                                                  E.\n\n          We consider next whether those officers present during the April 8 arrest who did not\nphysically participate in it, but instead observed the arresting officers perform the arrest, should\nbe liable for failing to intervene to stop the arresting officers’ use of excessive force. The\ngeneral rule is that police officers who were not actually involved in the challenged conduct will\nbe found to have violated the Fourth Amendment only if those officers “‘observed or had reason\nto know that excessive force would be or was being used’ and ‘had both the opportunity and the\nmeans to prevent the harm from occurring.’” Burgess, 735 F.3d at 475 (quoting Turner v. Scott,\n119 F.3d 425, 429 (6th Cir. 2011)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n          As we have already explained, Plaintiffs’ excessive-force claim fails because of\ninsufficient probative evidence to defeat summary judgment. Because Plaintiffs present no\nviable claim of excessive physical force, they can show no harm that other officers could have\nintervened to prevent. And because the alleged use of anti-homosexual slurs is not a violation of\nthe Constitution regardless of whether it is examined as an excessive-force claim or an equal-\nprotection claim, the failure of other officers to prevent that conduct did not violate Plaintiffs’\nrights.\n\n                                                  F.\n\n          Finally, we consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to\ntwo of the defendants—Park and Rojas—on Plaintiffs’ claim of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (IIED). The district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over that state-\nlaw claim, so we are required to apply Ohio law here. Miller v. Currie, 50 F.3d 373, 377 (6th\nCir. 1995). The elements of IIED in the State of Ohio are:\n\n          (1) that the actor either intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should\n          have known that actions taken would result in serious emotional distress to the\n          plaintiff, (2) that the actor’s conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to go\n          beyond all possible bounds of decency and was such that it can be considered as\n          utterly intolerable in a civilized community, (3) that the actor’s actions were the\n          proximate cause of the plaintiff’s psychic injury, and (4) that the mental anguish\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.          Page 18\n\n       suffered by the plaintiff is serious and of a nature that no reasonable man could be\n       expected to endure it.\n\nBurkes v. Stidham, 668 N.E.2d 982, 989 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted), quoted in\nRosebrough v. Buckeye Valley High Sch., 690 F.3d 427, 433 (6th Cir. 2012). We have held that\nOhio courts narrowly define “extreme and outrageous conduct,” such that this standard is\ndifficult to meet. Rosebrough, 690 F.3d at 434.\n\n       In their stricken affidavits, Ondo and Simcox identify Park and Rojas as the officers who\ncommitted several of the more extreme actions (e.g., punching in the face), and uttered some of\nthe offensive words. In district court, Park and Rojas claimed immunity under Ohio Revised\nCode § 2744.03(A)(6), while Plaintiffs argue that one of the statutory exceptions to that\nimmunity applies. But because the district court struck the affidavits from the record, the record\ncontains no evidence to support Plaintiffs’ IIED claim. The district court correctly granted\nsummary judgment on this count.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court was within its discretion when it\nstruck the affidavits that were based upon “personal knowledge and belief,” and did not err in\nconcluding that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. We therefore AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court.\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.

I join\nall but Parts III.B and III.C of Judge Batchelder’s thorough and persuasive opinion. In Part III.B,\nthe majority holds that Ondo and Simcox preserved one of their equal protection arguments—\nnamely, their claim that “the officers’ keeping them in their boxer shorts while transporting them\nto jail violated the Equal Protection Clause.” Supra at 12. I respectfully disagree. During oral\nargument, counsel for Ondo and Simcox conceded that all of their equal protection claims would\nfail if the plaintiffs’ affidavits were stricken. Oral Argument at 10:12–55, Ondo v. City of\nCleveland (No. 14-3527). Here is the question: “You have to have the affidavits to support\neither that [equal protection] claim or excessive force?” Id. at 10:55–59. Here is the answer:\n“Yes.” Id. at 11:00–01. I would hold Ondo and Simcox to their counsel’s answer—that, in the\nabsence of the affidavits, they do not have a cognizable excessive force or equal protection\nclaim. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732–33 (1993). The majority resists this\nconclusion because it is not aware “of any case in which we have concluded, after full briefing,\nthat Plaintiffs have completely abandoned every claim in their entire appeal based on a single\nverbal exchange during argument that did not include a clear and unequivocal surrender of all\nremaining issues.” Supra at 10. That is not what happened here. Counsel conceded only that if\nthe affidavits were struck, Ondo and Simcox’s remaining claims would fail. As to that kind of\nconcession—which attorneys often make for tactical reasons—we have frequently respected\ncounsels’ admissions at oral argument. See, e.g., United States v. Gibney, 519 F.3d 301, 304 (6th\nCir. 2008); United States v. Smith, 304 F. App’x 397, 399 (6th Cir. 2008); United States v.\nHawkins, 31 F. App’x 304, 304 (6th Cir. 2002). Under these circumstances, I see no reason in\nPart III.C to reach the merits of the equal protection claims.\n\f",

BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs Steven Ondo and Jonathan Simcox\nwere arrested in their temporarily shared residence by Cleveland police officers on April 8, 2011,\non allegations of felonious assault on a police officer. The arrest occurred in the early morning\nwhen Plaintiffs were still in their boxer shorts, and police refused their demands to retrieve\nadditional clothing, instead issuing them jumpsuits at some point after Plaintiffs arrived at the\npolice station. Plaintiffs have repeatedly changed their stories since the arrest. And in this\ncase—the second lawsuit arising from the arrest—Plaintiffs allege that the officers violated their\nFourth Amendment rights by repeatedly striking them. Plaintiffs, who are homosexual, further\nclaim that the officers violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection\nClause by forcing them to remain in their boxer shorts. Plaintiffs also claim that several of these\nactions constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress under Ohio law. Most of these\nallegations were pleaded only against the officers as a group, and Plaintiffs did not amend their\npleadings as additional facts purportedly came to light. Instead, when Defendants moved for\nsummary judgment, Plaintiffs filed affidavits based upon “personal knowledge and belief” with\ntheir opposition to summary judgment, claiming specifically—for the first time—which officer\nallegedly committed each act. The district court granted Defendants’ motion to strike these\naffidavits, explaining that the court did not know which statements were based solely on personal\nknowledge, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and which statements were\nbased only upon belief. The district court then held that without those affidavits, the remaining\nrecord did not contain sufficient evidence to permit Plaintiffs’ claims to survive Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       We hold that whether to strike in whole or in part affidavits based upon “personal\nknowledge and belief” is within the sound discretion of the district court, and that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion here. We also hold that, construing in the light most favorable\nto Plaintiffs the record that remains without the affidavits, Defendants are entitled to judgment as\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.              Page 3\n\na matter of law because Plaintiffs’ arguments fail on the merits. We therefore AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                          I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                                                  A.\n\n       At approximately 2:00 AM on April 2, 2011, Steven Ondo and Jonathan Simcox were\nreturning home after several hours of drinking alcohol, and got into a heated argument outside\ntheir apartment building. A neighbor came out to confront them, at which time Simcox told him\nto “F*** off.”    An altercation ensued involving all three men, during which the neighbor\nidentified himself as an off-duty police officer. Later that night police came to Plaintiffs’ door\nand arrested them in their apartment. Plaintiffs spent two nights in jail and were treated for\nminor injuries. Several days later, arrest warrants were issued for Plaintiffs for felonious assault\non a police officer. On April 8, 2011, at 7:00 AM, SWAT Team officers with the Cleveland\nPolice Warrant Team arrived at Plaintiff’s apartment in Cleveland. This ten-man team comprises\neight patrol officers under the command of two senior officers, Lieutenant Timothy Gaertner and\nSergeant Daniel Galmarini. After entering Plaintiffs’ apartment building through the unlocked\nfront door, Officer William Johnson encountered Ondo in the stairwell, informed Ondo of the\narrest warrant, and handed Ondo to other officers to handcuff. Johnson then encountered Simcox\nin the stairwell, handcuffed him, and handed him over to other officers on the second floor.\nOndo and Simcox were both agitated and repeatedly asked why they were being arrested. The\nofficers then exited the building, keeping Plaintiffs on the lawn for several minutes as they\nprepared to load them into a paddy-wagon van to travel to the next warrant location.\n\n       Jesse Simcox—the brother of Jonathan—had been sleeping in Ondo’s apartment that\nnight and went downstairs to investigate the commotion, where he found officers and Plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs claim the officers were “pushing [them] around” and punched them repeatedly in the\nface, and repeatedly uttered anti-homosexual slurs. Plaintiffs allege that although the officers\nallowed Jesse Simcox to fetch shoes for Plaintiffs, the police denied Jesse Simcox the\nopportunity to get pants for them, and thus they were forced to go to jail in their underwear,\nbecause, as officers allegedly told them, “faggots don’t wear pants in jail.” Plaintiffs alleged a\nbarrage of slurs, such as one officer’s saying, “It’s a house full of fags here.” Plaintiffs originally\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.            Page 4\n\nalleged that they were forced “to wear only their underwear for over a day,” later changing their\nstory to claim they were not issued jumpsuits until after dinnertime. While in jail, neither\nPlaintiff requested or received any medical care, or made any medical report to jail staff.\nMoreover, no injuries are visible in Plaintiffs’ booking photos.\n\n       The police denied Plaintiffs’ allegations. Gaertner and Galmarini were never named as\ndefendants in the litigation, and insist that each Plaintiff, when detained, was immediately placed\nunder a supervisor’s observation and control.         Gaertner and Galmarini swore during their\ndepositions that at no time did they observe any mistreatment or slurs. Gaertner did not know\nanything about a request for pants, while Galmarini said he made the decision to keep Plaintiffs\nin their boxer shorts because Plaintiffs were agitated (though not resistant), and because the\nofficers were executing a warrant for the alleged assault of an officer, so the supervisors decided\nfor officers’ safety to remove Plaintiffs from the apartment setting and convey them to jail as\nquickly as possible. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims, their booking photos prove conclusively that\nthey were promptly issued jumpsuits once they arrived at the jail.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ initial arrest occurred on April 2, 2011, and the second arrest followed on April\n8, 2011. On January 18, 2012, Plaintiffs filed suit against the City of Cleveland and several of its\nofficers in federal district court, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their\nconstitutional rights, as well as various state law claims. Plaintiffs later filed an amended\ncomplaint that the district court dismissed on August 27, 2012, for failure to allege sufficient\nfacts to support the counts in the amended complaint. Among other things, the court held that\nPlaintiffs’ alleged facts did not satisfy the standard for municipal liability. On April 5, 2013,\nOndo and Simcox filed the current § 1983 suit against seventeen defendants: the City of\nCleveland, Officer Clifford Kime, Officer Tintlenot, Officer Cavanaugh, Officer Kean, Sergeant\nElias Diaz, Officer Park, Officer Livingston, Officer Rojas, Officer Freeman, Officer Crytzer,\nOfficer William Johnson, Officer Sanchez, Officer Toomey, Corrections Officer Dennis Barack,\nCorrections Officer Rowell, and Corrections Officer Robinson. On October 1, 2013, the court\ndismissed Kime from the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a). The court later\ndismissed Barack and Sanchez due to lack of proper service, dismissed Cavanaugh, Tintlenot,\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.             Page 5\n\nDiaz, and Kean under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and dismissed the City of\nCleveland on the basis of claim preclusion from the first lawsuit.\n\n       Of the remaining nine defendants, seven are members of the SWAT Team, and two are\ncorrections officers. The complaint includes claims brought under § 1983 for excessive force,\nviolation of privacy, failure to intervene, and denial of equal protection. It also includes two\nOhio state-law claims, one for intentional infliction of emotional distress and the other for\ninvasion of privacy.     On February 15, 2014, Defendants moved for summary judgment.\nPlaintiffs filed their opposition to summary judgment, including affidavits from Ondo and\nSimcox in which they identified with specificity which officers purportedly committed various\nacts. Defendants filed a motion to strike the affidavits because they were based on “personal\nknowledge and belief,” instead of personal knowledge exclusively.\n\n       On April 28, 2014, the district court granted Defendants’ motion to strike, and held that\nwithout the specific information in the affidavits, Plaintiffs’ allegations were insufficiently\nsupported by the remaining evidence in the record—which includes depositions from Plaintiffs,\nDefendants, other police officers, and Jesse Simcox, plus jail booking photos of Plaintiffs—to\ncreate a genuine issue of fact for a jury that the officers used excessive force or otherwise\nmistreated Plaintiffs.   Consequently, the court granted Defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment. This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                 II.

ANALYSIS\n\n       We must decide six issues in this appeal.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       First, we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion by granting\nDefendants’ motion to strike Plaintiffs’ affidavits, in which Plaintiffs swore that their assertions\nwere based on “personal knowledge and belief.” Affidavits defeat summary judgment only if\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 7\n\nthey are “made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\nshow that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c)(4). The district court held that Plaintiffs’ affidavits did not fulfill this requirement.\n\n        Plaintiffs make three points.          First, Plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding the words\ncontained in the affidavits, the context makes clear that Plaintiffs were making averments based\non personal knowledge only, not belief. Second, they say that courts are required in these\nsituations to segregate affidavits into those parts that are based upon personal knowledge, and to\nadmit those parts into evidence, while rejecting the remainder. And third, they contend that a\ncourt can reject the affidavit entirely only if it clearly contradicts other evidence in an attempt to\ncreate “sham facts.”\n\n        In 2009, we held that when an affidavit is partially admissible and partially inadmissible,\nthe district court must reject only those parts that are inadmissible.

Ford Motor Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1188829\"><a href=\"/opinion/1188829/upshaw-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (6th Cir. 2009). Also in Plaintiffs’ favor, the Fifth Circuit ruled that “magic\nwords” are not required to make explicit that an affiant’s declaration is based on personal\ntestimony and competence, holding that a court can conclude from the context of the declaration\nwhether those requirements are satisfied.

Our affirming the district court’s\nsummary judgment for the defendants in Totman was further buttressed by the plaintiff’s lack of\ncertainty regarding precisely which officer committed each allegedly wrong act during the\nincident. See id. at 465.\n\n        This is an easier case than Totman. Here, as we explain below, there are clear factual\ndiscrepancies between the original complaint in the first lawsuit, subsequent complaints, the\naffidavits, and the admitted evidence. Some of Plaintiffs’ assertions here are either contradicted\nby the booking photos, or demonstrably false, such as the claim in their initial lawsuit that they\nwere forced to remain in their underwear throughout their entire detention and then forced to\nwalk home in their underwear, instead of being clothed in jumpsuits. In Totman, there were\nactual medical reports showing the plaintiff’s injuries, and the officer likely responsible had a\nhistory of excessive force. There are no such reports or evidence here—to the contrary, their\nbooking photos show no signs of injury or abuse—nor have Plaintiffs shown that the officers in\nquestion have a checkered history regarding the use of force. So while there was a significant\nfactual basis for the accounts of the Totman plaintiff, the same cannot be said of Plaintiffs’\naffidavits here.\n\n        “An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment]\nmust be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and\nshow that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.” Fed.

Page 9\n\njustifying a summary judgment if uncontradicted, the opposing party has the duty to show the\nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact.” 10B Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2738, at 345 (3d ed. 1998) (referencing Rule 56(e), the predecessor of Rule\n56(c)(4)). As part of this duty, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4) “limits the matter to be\nproperly included in an affidavit to facts, and the facts introduced must be alleged on personal\nknowledge. Thus, . . . statements made on belief or ‘on information and belief,’ cannot be\nutilized on a summary-judgment motion.” Id. at 345–46, 350–54 (footnotes omitted).\n\n        We hold that when affidavits based on knowledge and belief are submitted to support or\noppose a motion for summary judgment, the district court has discretion to determine whether it\ncan differentiate between knowledge and belief for each averment in the affidavit. If the court\ncan distinguish between the two, then, as was the case in Upshaw, the court should excuse the\naffiant’s stylistic error, and must admit the parts based solely upon personal knowledge, while\nstriking the parts based upon belief. If the court cannot differentiate between the two, then\nconsistent with the rationale in Wright & Miller, the court must strike the affidavit in its entirety,\nas in Totman. We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision on whether it could\ndistinguish between knowledge and belief for each of the affidavit’s averments, and thus whether\nto strike in part or to strike in toto.\n\n        The district court here found that it could not make those determinations regarding the\naffidavits filed by Ondo and Simcox, and so struck both affidavits in their entirety. We conclude\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n        We turn next to claims that arguably were abandoned at oral argument.                 During\nargument, Plaintiffs’ counsel, in responding to questions from the bench, conceded that without\nthe stricken affidavits, all of Plaintiffs’ claims would fail, raising the possibility that Plaintiffs\nwere abandoning the entirety of the remainder of their appeal. We note that most of the\naffidavits’ content concerned specific alleged incidents of excessive physical force, identifying\nindividual officers with individual acts. So as we address in some detail hereinafter, without the\naffidavits, Plaintiffs’ claims of excessive force and intentional infliction of emotional distress\ncannot survive summary judgment.\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.            Page 10\n\n       However, the equal-protection claim requires a closer look. We should not necessarily\nconstrue a single inartful or ill-advised verbal response from counsel as waiving anything more\nthan was directly at issue in the discussion at that time. Even in district court, where it is not\nuncommon for a claim to be dropped during litigation, we are not quick to declare that a claim\nhas been abandoned. See, e.g., Hayward v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615–18 (6th\nCir. 2014). We are not aware of any case in which we have concluded, after full briefing, that\nPlaintiffs have completely abandoned every claim in their entire appeal based on a single verbal\nexchange during argument that did not include a clear and unequivocal surrender of all\nremaining issues. We are aware of the potentially chilling effect such a practice would have.\n\n       This issue is muddled by the inconsistency of Plaintiffs’ argument. In their complaint,\nPlaintiffs pleaded that by preventing them from wearing pants, the officers “treated [them]\ndifferently” because they are homosexual, and also that the police officers used “increased\nviolence and excessive force” against Plaintiffs and subjected them to “ridicule” and “called\nthem derogatory names, intended to humiliate them,” “because of their sexual orientation.”\nThese purportedly injurious acts, Plaintiffs allege, were inflicted upon them “because of their\nsexual preference” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiffs later cited among their\ncauses of action that their equal-protection rights were violated when they were treated\ndifferently in the course of actions that otherwise violated the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. Plaintiffs further elaborated upon these points when opposing Defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment, and the district court construed their argument as asserting that the\nofficers violated their equal-protection rights both by forcing them to remain in their underwear\nand by subjecting them to anti-homosexual slurs. On appeal, Plaintiffs’ principal brief makes\nclear their argument: “Plaintiffs do not contend that their constitutional rights to equal protection\nwere violated because the Defendants used homophobic slurs or because they had a\nconstitutional right to go to jail in particular clothing. Rather, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims\nare based on Defendants’ intentional decision to treat them differently simply because they are\ngay.” Yet in their reply brief, although at first they reiterate their broad argument by arguing that\nany state actions motivated by disapproval of homosexuality violate the Equal Protection Clause,\nthey then immediately reverse course, asserting that “Appellants are not claiming that being\ncalled [homophobic slurs] numerous times is an Equal Protection violation. They are also not\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.           Page 11\n\nclaiming that being told ‘faggots don’t get to wear pants to jail’ is an Equal Protection violation.”\nRather, Plaintiffs’ reply brief explains, “The act of . . . withholding pants from [them] only\nbecause they are gay is the violation.” Subsequently, at the relevant point during oral argument,\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, in discussing part of their equal-protection claim, seemed to recur to\nPlaintiffs’ initial appellate argument, separately arguing all three grounds to support their alleged\nequal-protection argument that they had raised in their principal brief: (1) that officers physically\nmistreated Plaintiffs because of their sexuality; (2) that officers required them to go for a\nprolonged period of time without proper clothing; and (3) that officers called them names.\n\n        During oral argument, one member of the panel posed this question to counsel for\nPlaintiffs regarding the equal-protection claim:      “Is it your view that if you strike all the\naffidavits there really is no evidence supporting the claim?” Counsel responded, “I do think that\nas a result of striking the affidavits the equal protection claim was also done away with.” That\njudge pressed further: “Properly. You have to have the affidavits to support either that claim or\nthe excessive force?” And counsel answered, “Yes.” The stricken affidavits consisted mostly of\nPlaintiffs’ asserting which individual defendant had engaged in which instance of mistreatment.\nWithout those affidavits, the record contains no evidence as to the identity of the officers who\nallegedly used excessive force against Plaintiffs. But Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim is not\ndependent on identifying any specific officer. The claim is that the police transported them\ninappropriately attired. It is true that the record on summary judgment contains Jesse Simcox’s\ndeposition testimony that the unidentified officer who allowed him to get shoes for Plaintiffs also\nprevented him from getting pants for them because “faggots don’t get to wear pants in jail.” The\nrecord also contains Officer Johnson’s deposition testimony that he talked to Jesse and asked him\nto help “find” Plaintiffs some shoes. And nowhere except in the affidavits did Plaintiffs even\nattempt to link those two pieces of testimony so as to identify Officer Johnson as having\ndelivered that single anti-homosexual slur. But the deposition evidence supports Plaintiffs’\nclaim that the officers on the scene transported Plaintiffs—wearing only their boxer shorts—to\njail.\n\n        In sum, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection argument was framed broadly, then narrowly, then\nbroadly again, then possibly abandoned altogether. The inconsistencies in Plaintiffs’ position are\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 12\n\nmanifest.    We will therefore consider their equal-protection claim only as their final brief\nrestated it, that the officers’ keeping them in their boxer shorts while transporting them to jail\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                                        C.\n\n        Regardless of our stance on abandonment, on the remaining record the equal-protection\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ keeping them in their underwear violates Plaintiffs’\nrights under the Equal Protection Clause, which requires that no State may “deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend.

Under rational-basis review, the government’s actions enjoy a “strong presumption\nof validity.” Id. at 319.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the state action of which they complain burdens a\nfundamental right. When the Supreme Court held that state laws against sodomy violate the Due\nProcess Clause, it did so using the language of rational-basis review, rather than any form of\nheightened scrutiny.

And as we have already explained, Obergefell did not abrogate\n\fNo. 14-3527                     Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.                   Page 15\n\nthose prior cases. We therefore have no basis for reviewing Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim on\nany basis more stringent than rational-basis review.\n\n        Applying the rational-basis test here, viewing the admitted evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Plaintiffs and drawing all inferences in their favor, we hold that a police officer’s\ndecision to keep Plaintiffs in their boxer shorts does not violate the Constitution. Plaintiffs have\nnot shown that our precedents recognize as an equal-protection violation the decision to keep\nsuspects in their current state of dress—including boxer shorts—so long as the person is attired\nsuch that his appearance is not obscene and the police officer provides an explanation that\nsatisfies the rational-basis test. Sergeant Galmarini’s explanation here of concern for officers’\nsafety—whether subjectively true or not—is presumed valid and rationally related to a legitimate\npublic interest. Therefore Plaintiffs’ grievance regarding being kept in their boxer shorts until\nthe police could issue them jumpsuits, even if motivated in part by sentiments regarding\nhomosexual behavior, still does not violate the Constitution.\n\n                                                        D.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ next claim is that the arresting officers used excessive force against them.4\n“The Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of excessive force by arresting and investigating\nofficers.”    Smoak v.

Plaintiffs’\nexcessive-force claim consisted of nonspecific allegations that unnamed officers punched them\nrepeatedly, especially “in the face” or “in the nose.” In the absence of the affidavits, these\nallegations of physical mistreatment are not sufficiently specific under Lanman to withstand\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment. We note that following their first arrest on April 2,\nPlaintiffs sought and received medical care for the minor injuries they sustained during the fight\nwith the off-duty officer. But after the April 8 arrest, despite their allegations of repeated\nphysical strikes, Plaintiffs sought no medical treatment and made no report of such abuse.\nMoreover, no injuries are visible in their booking photos, which is especially significant given\nthat the only specific aspect of Plaintiffs’ allegations is that they were struck on their faces.\nPlaintiffs’ complaint and the discovery that was entered into evidence either attribute purported\nwrongful acts to the group as a whole, or to officers described in such general terms (e.g.,\nwearing glasses) as to foreclose attributing any one act to any one officer.                           Rather than\nattempting to amend their complaint, Plaintiffs waited eleven months, and only then submitting\naffidavits to augment these allegations in their opposition brief to Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment.           Because the district court was within its discretion in striking those\n\n         5\n          Much of Kingsley’s holding pertains only to due-process issues that arise in the context of operating a\ndetention facility, but the aspects cited here would apply to excessive-force claims against police officers regardless\nof whether the purported violation occurred during an arrest or during pretrial detention.\n\fNo. 14-3527                  Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.           Page 17\n\naffidavits, the allegations of physical mistreatment are therefore not supported by sufficient\nevidence to defeat summary judgment.\n\n                                                  E.\n\n          We consider next whether those officers present during the April 8 arrest who did not\nphysically participate in it, but instead observed the arresting officers perform the arrest, should\nbe liable for failing to intervene to stop the arresting officers’ use of excessive force. The\ngeneral rule is that police officers who were not actually involved in the challenged conduct will\nbe found to have violated the Fourth Amendment only if those officers “‘observed or had reason\nto know that excessive force would be or was being used’ and ‘had both the opportunity and the\nmeans to prevent the harm from occurring.’” Burgess, 735 F.3d at 475 (quoting Turner v. Scott,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 (6th Cir. 2011)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n          As we have already explained, Plaintiffs’ excessive-force claim fails because of\ninsufficient probative evidence to defeat summary judgment. Because Plaintiffs present no\nviable claim of excessive physical force, they can show no harm that other officers could have\nintervened to prevent. And because the alleged use of anti-homosexual slurs is not a violation of\nthe Constitution regardless of whether it is examined as an excessive-force claim or an equal-\nprotection claim, the failure of other officers to prevent that conduct did not violate Plaintiffs’\nrights.\n\n                                                  F.\n\n          Finally, we consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to\ntwo of the defendants—Park and Rojas—on Plaintiffs’ claim of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (IIED). The district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over that state-\nlaw claim, so we are required to apply Ohio law here. Miller v. Currie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691982\"><a href=\"/opinion/691982/barbara-c-miller-v-richard-s-currie-doris-currie-todd-hamilton-noll-brad/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (6th\nCir. 1995). The elements of IIED in the State of Ohio are:\n\n          (1) that the actor either intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should\n          have known that actions taken would result in serious emotional distress to the\n          plaintiff, (2) that the actor’s conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to go\n          beyond all possible bounds of decency and was such that it can be considered as\n          utterly intolerable in a civilized community, (3) that the actor’s actions were the\n          proximate cause of the plaintiff’s psychic injury, and (4) that the mental anguish\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.          Page 18\n\n       suffered by the plaintiff is serious and of a nature that no reasonable man could be\n       expected to endure it.\n\nBurkes v. Stidham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3709779\"><a href=\"/opinion/3959968/burkes-v-stidham/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 989 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted), quoted in\nRosebrough v. Buckeye Valley High Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (6th Cir. 2012). We have held that\nOhio courts narrowly define “extreme and outrageous conduct,” such that this standard is\ndifficult to meet. Rosebrough, 690 F.3d at 434.\n\n       In their stricken affidavits, Ondo and Simcox identify Park and Rojas as the officers who\ncommitted several of the more extreme actions (e.g., punching in the face), and uttered some of\nthe offensive words. In district court, Park and Rojas claimed immunity under Ohio Revised\nCode § 2744.03(A)(6), while Plaintiffs argue that one of the statutory exceptions to that\nimmunity applies. But because the district court struck the affidavits from the record, the record\ncontains no evidence to support Plaintiffs’ IIED claim. The district court correctly granted\nsummary judgment on this count.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court was within its discretion when it\nstruck the affidavits that were based upon “personal knowledge and belief,” and did not err in\nconcluding that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. We therefore AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court.\n\fNo. 14-3527                 Ondo, et al. v. City of Cleveland, et al.

I join\nall but Parts III.B and III.C of Judge Batchelder’s thorough and persuasive opinion. In Part III.B,\nthe majority holds that Ondo and Simcox preserved one of their equal protection arguments—\nnamely, their claim that “the officers’ keeping them in their boxer shorts while transporting them\nto jail violated the Equal Protection Clause.” Supra at 12. I respectfully disagree. During oral\nargument, counsel for Ondo and Simcox conceded that all of their equal protection claims would\nfail if the plaintiffs’ affidavits were stricken. Oral Argument at 10:12–55, Ondo v. City of\nCleveland (No. 14-3527). Here is the question: “You have to have the affidavits to support\neither that [equal protection] claim or excessive force?” Id. at 10:55–59. Here is the answer:\n“Yes.” Id. at 11:00–01. I would hold Ondo and Simcox to their counsel’s answer—that, in the\nabsence of the affidavits, they do not have a cognizable excessive force or equal protection\nclaim. See United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732–33 (1993). The majority resists this\nconclusion because it is not aware “of any case in which we have concluded, after full briefing,\nthat Plaintiffs have completely abandoned every claim in their entire appeal based on a single\nverbal exchange during argument that did not include a clear and unequivocal surrender of all\nremaining issues.” Supra at 10. That is not what happened here. Counsel conceded only that if\nthe affidavits were struck, Ondo and Simcox’s remaining claims would fail. As to that kind of\nconcession—which attorneys often make for tactical reasons—we have frequently respected\ncounsels’ admissions at oral argument. See, e.g., United States v. Gibney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194211/united-states-v-gibney/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (6th\nCir. 2008); United States v. Smith, 304 F. App’x 397, 399 (6th Cir. 2008); United States v.\nHawkins, 31 F. App’x 304, 304 (6th Cir. 2002). Under these circumstances, I see no reason in\nPart III.C to reach the merits of the equal protection claims.\n\f</pre>",
