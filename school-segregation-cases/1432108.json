THE RELEVANT FEDERAL STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING\n       UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS.\n\n       A.        The 1872 General Mining Law.\n\n       In 1872, Congress enacted 30 U.S.C. §§ 22–54 (“the General Mining Law”) that\nprovides:\n\n       [A]ll valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both\n       surveyed and unsurveyed, shall be free and open to exploration and purchase, and\n       the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the\n       United States . . . under regulations prescribed by law[.]\n\n30 U.S.C. § 22.\n\n         The General Mining Law “made public lands available to people for the purpose of\nmining valuable mineral deposits,” with the aim of “reward[ing] and encourag[ing] the discovery\nof minerals that are valuable in an economic sense.” United States v. Coleman, 390 U.S. 599,\n602 (1968); see also Cal. Coastal Comm’n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 595 (1987)\n(Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“In general, [the General Mining Law of\n1872] opens the public lands to exploration. If one discovers valuable mineral deposits, the\nstatute grants him the right to extract and sell the minerals without paying a royalty to the United\nStates, as well as the right—subject to certain statutory requirements—to obtain fee title to the\nland.”).\n\n        To secure rights under the General Mining Law, a claimant first must “locate” a valid\nmining claim on federal lands, physically mark the boundaries of the claim, post a discovery\nmonument and notice, and satisfy other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. See 30\nU.S.C. § 28 (enumerating the requirements for “location” of a mining claim, including distinctly\nmarking the boundaries of the claim and maintaining adequate records concerning the date of\nlocation and boundaries of the claims); see also United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 86 (1985)\n(“‘Discovery’ of a mineral deposit, followed by the minimal procedures required to formally\n\n\n                                                                     3\n\f‘locate’ the deposit, gives an individual the right of exclusive possession of the land for mining\npurposes[.]”). But the location of a mining claim is only the first step in the process, because “a\nmining claimant acquires no vested rights by location of a mining claim. Even though a claim\nmay be perfected in all other respects, unless and until a claimant is able to show that the claim\nis supported by a discovery of a valuable locatable mineral within the boundaries of the claim,\nno rights are acquired.” United States v. Rocky Conner, 139 IBLA 361, 365 (1997) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n         For mining claims 2 located on areas designated as “Limited Use” or “Class L” lands, the\nBLM requires an operator to submit and obtain approval of a plan of operations “before\nbeginning operations greater than casual use.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(a). 3 This requirement has\nbeen in place since 1980, when the BLM promulgated surface management regulations for\nmining operations, to prevent “unnecessary or undue degradation of federal lands which may\nresult from operations authorized by the mining laws.” NOTICE OF FINAL RULEMAKING, 45 FED.\nREG. 78,902, 78,909 (Nov. 26, 1980); see also id. at 78,911 (promulgating 43 C.F.R. § 3809)\n(“An approved plan of operations is required prior to commencing . . . [a]ny operation, except\ncasual use, in . . . [the] California Desert Conservation Area”); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.1-4 (1983)\n(“An approved plan of operations is required prior to commencing . . . [a]ny operation, except\ncasual use, in . . . [l]ands in the California Desert Conservation Area designated as ‘controlled’\nor ‘limited’ use areas[.]”); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.1-4 (1994) (same); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(c) (same);\n43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(c)(1) (2014) (same).\n\n        The BLM requires that a plan of operations must include: operator information; a\ndescription of the mining operations to be undertaken; maps; water management plans; and other\ninformation “sufficient for BLM to determine that the plan of operations prevents unnecessary or\nundue degradation.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.401. Once a plan of operations is approved, an operator\nis entitled to begin mining, consistent with the plan and applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. See 43 C.F.R. § 3809.412 (“You must not begin operations until BLM approves\nyour plan of operations[.]”); see also 43 C.F.R. § 3809.415(a) (obligating a mining claimant to\ncomply with “the terms and conditions of your notice or approved plan of operations and other\nFederal and State laws related to environmental protection and protection of cultural resources”);\n43 C.F.R. § 3809.3 (requiring a mining claimant to follow state laws or regulations for\noperations on public lands, unless they conflict with the BLM’s regulations). When a mining\n\n       2\n          The mining claims at issue in this case are located within the California Desert\nConservation Area, established by Congress in 1976, pursuant to Section 601 of the Federal\nLand Management and Policy Act. See 43 U.S.C. § 1781 (establishing the California Desert\nConservation Area “to provide for the immediate and future protection and administration of\n[those] lands . . . within the framework of a program of multiple use and sustained yield, and the\nmaintenance of environmental quality”). The claims are located on lands designated as “Limited\nUse” or “Class L” lands. JSF ¶ 5 (“The El Paso placer claims and Big Jim Lode claim were and\nare located within the Conservation Area on land that the [BLM] has designated as ‘Limited\nUse’ or ‘Class L’ lands.”).\n       3\n         “Casual use,” is defined as “activities ordinarily resulting in no or negligible disturbance\nof public lands or resources.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.5.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\foperator decides to make changes to the “operations described in [the] approved plan of\noperations,” the operator is requires to submit, and have approved, a modified plan of operations.\nSee 43 C.F.R. § 3809.431; see also id. § 432(a) (explaining that the “BLM will review and\napprove a modification of your plan of operations in the same manner as it reviewed and\napproved your initial plan [of operations]”).\n\n        As a matter of law, the “location” of a mining claim and an approved plan of operations\ndo not convey a compensable property interest to extract and sell minerals. See Skaw v. United\nStates, 13 Cl. Ct. 7, 28 (1987), aff’d, 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (“Until the discovery of a\nvaluable mineral deposit, the locator has only a gratuity from the United States.”) (emphasis\nadded); see also id. (“A valuable mineral deposit is an occurrence of mineralization of such\nquantity and quality as to warrant a person of ordinary prudence in the expenditure of time and\nmoney in the development of a mine and the extraction of the mineral.”); Payne v. United States,\n31 Fed. Cl. 709, 711 (1994) (“[A] finding that the unpatented claim is valid against the United\nStates . . . can only be made if there has been a discovery of [a] mineral within the limits of the\nclaim.”).\n\n        A “discovery” sufficient to vest a claimant with a compensable property right requires\nthat the claimant physically must locate a mineral deposit that is “of such a character that ‘a\nperson of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and means,\nwith a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.’” Best v. Humboldt Placer\nMin. Co., 371 U.S. 334, 335−36 (1963) (holding that unpatented mining claims are “valid against\nthe United States if there has been a discovery of mineral within the limits of the claim”)\n(quoting Castle v. Womble, 19 Pub. Lands Dec. 455, 457 (1894)). A mining claimant also must\nestablish that “the mineral can be ‘extracted, removed, and marketed at a profit.’”\nColeman v. United States, 390 U.S. 599, 600 (1968).\n\n        To determine if a discovery has been made, the BLM conducts a validity examination,\nalso referred to as a valid existing rights (“VER”) determination. See Freeman v. United States,\n83 Fed. Cl. 530, 533 (2008) (recognizing that the BLM has primary jurisdiction to determine the\nvalidity of mining claims, and that “a validity determination of the mining claims is necessary to\nestablish a compensable property interest”); see also Vane Minerals (US), LLC v. United States,\n116 Fed. Cl. 48, 57 (2014) (“The BLM and Forest Service must conduct a valid existing rights\ndetermination to ascertain whether a claimant has made a discovery of a valuable mineral\ndeposit[.]”); Ware v. United States, 57 Fed. Cl. 782, 786 (2003) (“The determination of validity\nhas been placed by Congress in the hands of the Department of the Interior.”); Payne, 31 Fed. Cl.\nat 712 (staying a case to allow the BLM to undertake “a validity determination” of unpatented\nmining claims, because that “determination has to be made before plaintiffs could recover”). If\nthe BLM determines that a claimant has not discovered a valuable mineral deposit, it will initiate\ncontest proceedings before an administrative law judge at the Department of the Interior. See 43\nC.F.R. § 4.451-1 (allowing the Government to “initiate contests for any cause affecting the\nlegality of validity of any . . . mining claim”); see also Cook v. United States, 85 Fed. Cl. 820,\n824 (2009) (explaining that the BLM has authority to “file an administrative contest proceeding\nif the [G]overnment finds that the mining claim does not in fact contain a discovery of a valuable\nmineral deposit”). And, a mining claimant has the right to appeal an administrative law judge’s\nadverse decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (“IBLA”) and then to appeal to a United\nStates District Court, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551. See\n\n\n                                                5\n\fAulston v. United States, 823 F.2d 510, 513 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (“Although judicial review of the\nIBLA determination is not precluded, Congress has vested review in the district courts, not in the\n[United States Court of Federal Claims]”). Indeed, where the BLM has “decided that the United\nStates (not the claimants) own the disputed [mining claims], the [United States] Court of\n[Federal] Claims [can]not review or overturn that administrative determination, even though that\ncourt indisputably ha[s] jurisdiction over ‘taking’ claims.” Id. at 514.\n\n       Provided that a claimant makes a discovery and complies with applicable regulations, the\nowner of unpatented mining claims has the right to extract minerals from the ground, but the\nGovernment maintains fee simple in the land. See Best, 371 U.S. at 335–36 (describing\nunpatented mining claims as “a possessory interest in land that is ‘mineral in character’”); see\nalso Kunkes v. United States, 78 F.3d 1549, 1554 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (explaining that, with an\nunpatented mining claim, “[t]itle to the land remains with the United States, and the unpatented\nmining claim holder has the right to use the Government’s fee simple estate for mining\npurposes”).\n\n       It is established that unpatented mining claims are property within the protection of the\nFifth Amendment’s prohibition against uncompensated takings. See Kunkes, 78 F.3d at 1551.\nBut, the Government “maintains broad powers over the terms and conditions upon which the\npublic lands can be used, leased, and acquired,” and it retains significant regulatory authority\nover unpatented mining claims. See Locke, 471 U.S. at 104. For example, a claimant may only\nuse the land encompassing an unpatented mining claim in ways that are “reasonably incident to\nmining,” be required to pay annual maintenance fees, or forfeit the claims for failure to meet\nother certain statutory and regulatory requirements. See Michael v. United States, 549 Fed.\nApp’x 960, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (enumerating limitations on the scope of an unpatented mining\nclaimant’s property right); see also Kunkes, 78 F.3d at 1551.\n\n       In sum, as a matter of law, Congress authorized the Government, “after proper notice and\nupon adequate hearing, to determine whether the claim is valid and, if not to declare it null and\nvoid.” Cameron v. United States, 252 U.S. 450, 460 (1920).\n\n       B.      The 1955 Common Varieties Act.\n\n        In 1955, Congress enacted the Common Varieties Act, 30 U.S.C. § 611, that withdrew\ncertain “common varieties” of minerals, such as sand, gravel, pumice, and pumicite, from the\nGeneral Mining Law. See 30 U.S.C. § 611 (“No deposit of common varieties of sand, stone,\ngravel, pumice, pumicite, or cinders and no deposit of petrified wood shall be deemed a valuable\nmineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the United States so as to give\neffective validity to any mining claim hereafter located under such mining laws[.]”). Mineral\ndeposits that “ha[ve] some property giving it distinct and special value,” however, are excluded\nfrom the Common Varieties Act, and are subject to private ownership, i.e., they are “locatable,”\nunder the General Mining Law. Id. These types of mineral deposits are referred to as\n“uncommon variety minerals.” Copar Pumice Co. v. United States, 112 Fed. Cl. 515, 521\n(2013).\n\n       To ascertain whether a deposit constitutes an uncommon variety, the BLM prepares a\n“mineral examination report,” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.100(a), known as a “common variety\n\n\n                                                6\n\fdetermination[.]” See Cook, 85 Fed. Cl. at 824 (construing Section 3809.100 as requiring a\n“common variety determination”). A mineral examination report may confirm a mineral’s status\nas an “uncommon variety.” Id. at 824.\n\n       C.      The California Surface Mining And Reclamation Act of 1975.\n\n        In 1995, California’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (“SMARA”) was\nenacted that requires a mine operator must have an approved plan in place before it may reclaim\nlands surrounding a mine after operations cease, by “ripping all compacted aboveground surface\ndisturbance, followed by the recontouring, stabilization, and approximation of the soil surface\nagainst the long-term effects of erosion.” Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 2710; DX-131; see also\nNelson v. Cnty. of Kern, 190 Cal. App. 4th 252, 259 n.3 (2010) (“SMARA requires reclamation\nplans for surface mining operations in California after 1975 . . . and provides that ‘no person\nshall conduct surface mining operations unless a permit is obtained from, a reclamation plan has\nbeen submitted to and approved by, and financial assurances for reclamation have been approved\nby, the lead agency for the operation pursuant to this article.’” (quoting Cal. Pub. Res.\nCode. § 2770)). A bond and reclamation plan is required only for aboveground mines, but if an\nunderground mine has more than one-acre of total surface area disturbance, SMARA does apply.\nDX-131.\n\n       D.      The 1976 Federal Land Policy And Management Act.\n\n        In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (“FLPMA”) to\nadminister public lands more efficiently and comprehensively by balancing environmental,\neconomic, and federalism concerns. See 43 U.S.C. § 1701(a)(1)–(13) (enumerating the polices\nof FLPMA). Pursuant to Section 204, the Secretary of the Interior (the “Secretary”) is\nauthorized to withdraw certain public lands from location and entry from the General Mining\nLaw. See 43 U.S.C. § 1714(a) (“[T]he Secretary is authorized to make . . . withdrawals[,] but\nonly in accordance with the provisions and limitations of this section.”); see also id. § 1702(j)\n(providing that “‘withdrawal’ means withholding an area of Federal land from settlement, sale,\nlocation, or entry, under some or all of the general land laws”). The Secretary also has authority\nto “segregate[]” lands from the operation of the public lands laws of the United States for a\nlimited period of time, by publishing notice of the segregation in the Federal Register. See 43\nU.S.C. § 1714(b)(1).\n\n        A withdrawal prohibits establishment of new mining claims on public lands but does not\nextinguish claims of the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit that was made prior to the date\nof withdrawal. See Skaw, 13 Cl. Ct. at 28 (“When land is closed to location under the mining\nlaws subsequent to the location of a mining claim, the validity of the claim cannot be recognized\nunless the claim was supported by a valid discovery at the time of the withdrawal.”); see also\nCameron, 252 U.S. at 456 (holding that a mining claim is valid if “there is an adequate mineral\ndiscovery within the limits of the claim” that “preceded the creation of [the] reserve [that\nwithdrew the lands]”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f       E.      The 1976 California Desert Protection Act and the 1994 California Desert\n               Protection Act.\n\n       In 1976, Congress also enacted the California Desert Conservation Protection Act. See\n43 U.S.C. § 1781(d) (directing the Secretary to “prepare and implement a comprehensive, long-\nrange plan for the management, use, development, and protection of the public lands within the\nCalifornia Desert Conservation Area”). On October 31, 1994, the California Desert Protection\nAct (“CDPA”) was enacted that directed the Secretary to transfer certain lands within the\nCalifornia Desert Protection Area to the State for inclusion in Red Rock Canyon State Park. See\n16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-71.\n\nII.    THE RELEVANT FACTS. 5\n\n       A.      Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Claims From The Early\n               July 1995.\n\n        In the early 1980’s, Theodore Simonson (“Mr. Simonson”) began to explore pumicite\ndeposits 7 in California and hired Dr. Charles Chesterman to assist in that effort. PX-1. In\nNovember 1983, Mr. Simonson and his then-wife located twenty-one, forty-acre placer mining\nclaims 8 in Kern County, California, under the General Mining Law. JSF ¶ 1. In November\n1983, four mill site claims 9 also were located in Kern County, California. JSF ¶ 3. These claims\nwere named as “El Paso 1” through “El Paso 21.” JSF ¶ 1. Thereafter, Mr. Simonson drilled an\nexploratory hole on the El Paso 6 claim to determine the thickness of the “Reoforce pumicite”\n       5\n          The relevant facts discussed herein were derived from: a September 16–23, 2013 trial\n(“TR 1–1360”), where the court heard testimony and admitted: Joint Exhibits (“JX-3–81”);\nPlaintiffs’ trial exhibits (“PX-1–445”); and the Government’s trial exhibits (“DX-2–246”). In\naddition, the parties submitted a Joint Stipulation of Facts (“JSF 1–26”).\n       7\n         Pumicite is a naturally occurring amorphous (without crystal form) silica that is white to\nfaint gray with “less than one percent iron, and [] composed mostly of micron sized glassy grains\nof rhyolitic composition with some smectite and traces of calcite, quartz, feldspar, and\ncristobolite.” PX-42. Plaintiffs refer to the pumicite in this case by the name “Rheoforce” or\n“Rheolite” at different points in time. PX-3 (1987 Reoforce Business Plan) (describing\n“Rheoforce [as] the product, the concept and the company”); 9/16/13 TR 47 (Simonson).\nHerein, the court will refer to this mineral as “Reoforce pumicite.”\n       8\n         A lode claim is “[a] classic vein, ledge, or other rock in place between definite walls. A\nlode claim is located by metes and bounds.” BLM, Mining Claims and Mill Sites,\nhttp://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/info/iac/faqmc.html (last visited September 16, 2014); see also 43\nC.F.R. § 3832.21(a). Placer mining claims include “[a]ll deposits, other than lodes.” BLM,\nMining Claims and Mill Sites, http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/info/iac/faqmc.html (last visited\nSeptember 16, 2014); see also 43 C.F.R. § 3832.21(b).\n       9\n         “A mill site is a location of nonmineral land not contiguous to a vein or lode that you\ncan use for activities reasonably incident to mineral development on, or production from, the\nunpatented or patented lode or placer claim with which it is associated.” 43 C.F.R. § 3832.31.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fdeposit. 9/23/13 TR 1287 (Simonson). That effort confirmed the presence of a pumicite deposit\nthat was 14 feet thick in some locations, extending to 28 feet thick in others. Id. This was the\nonly drilling that Mr. Simonson conducted prior to the BLM entering into the MOU in August\n1995. 9/17/13 TR 492–93 (Simonson). 11\n\n         In January 1984 and March 1985, two other placer claims were located and named as “El\nPaso 22” and “El Paso 23.” JSF ¶ 1. Around this time, however, Mr. Simonson also learned that\ncertain fillers and extenders, such as crystalline silica, were carcinogenic. 9/16/13 TR 60\n(Simonson); PX-96 (describing natural silica as “contain[ing] high levels of crystalline quartz\nand crystabolite[,] which are potential carcinogens”). Consequently, Mr. Simonson had testing\nperformed on “Reoforce pumicite” to determine if it contained any quartz, rendering it\npotentially carcinogenic. 9/16/13 TR 61 (Simonson). In a January 30, 1984 letter from John A.\nKlasic, Chair of the Earth Sciences Department at California State Polytechnic University at\nPomona to Steve Ryland, a geologist who Mr. Simonson hired to assist with the development of\nthe mining claims, Professor Klasic explained that he “doubt[ed] if there is quartz in the\n[pumicite] sample.” PX-6. But Professor Klasic also cautioned that, while the “analysis was\neasy . . . , the interpretation is pure speculation.” PX-6.\n\n        In 1984, Mr. Simonson also contacted Steven Driscoll, a Professor of Plastics\nEngineering at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts and asked him to analyze “Reoforce\npumicite” to ascertain its potential use by the plastics industry. 9/16/13 TR 45–47 (Simonson).\nIn May 1984, Professor Driscoll prepared and presented a report at the Society of Plastic\nEngineers Annual Technical Conference that analyzed the benefits of using “Reoforce pumicite”\nas a mineral filler. 14 The Report concluded that “Reoforce pumicite” “offers some very\nattractive advantages,” including: (1) use as a filler in polypropylene, as it led to comparable\ntensile properties and flexural strength, improved flexural modulus, and improved\nhardness/scratch resistance and “improved handling and processability;” and (2) use as a filler in\nABS, where it led to improved tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural\nmodulus, impact strength, and improved hardness/scratch resistance and improved handling and\nprocessability. PX-7.\n\n       In September 1985, Mr. Simonson obtained, via quitclaim deed, a twenty-acre\nunpatented mining lode claim, identified and named the “Big Jim Lode claim,” that overlapped\nportions of an existing claim named El Paso 6 and El Paso 22. JSF ¶ 4.\n\n      In January 1987, DL Laboratories compared the reflectance and opacity of various\nsamples, including a sample comprising 100% Ti02 with one comprising a 40% (Ti02)/60% (a\n“Reoforce pumicite”) mixture. PX-16. The results demonstrated that, as the percentage of\n\n       11\n          This was contrary to other testimony. 9/11/13 Springer Direct Testimony, Dkt. No. 78-\n1, at 6 (“It is my understanding that only three holes had been drilled on the Reoforce claims\nbefore August 1995 and that, at most, two of those holes intercepted any pumicite.”).\n       14\n          According to Professor Driscoll, “fillers” are classified as “extenders, functional, or\nreinforcements depending upon the degree of cost reduction and enhancement of functional\nproperties in the polymeric material system.” PX-7.\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f“Reoforce pumicite” increased, reflectance decreased significantly, but opacity was largely\nunchanged. PX-16. Another test was designed to “evaluate two natural glass fillers, [the\n“Reoforce pumicite” in two different sizes and Gold Bond R,] for potential use in typical interior\nflat latex wall paints,” as an extender. PX-16. That test concluded that the 30 Micron size\n“Reoforce pumicite” functionally was equivalent, i.e., neither inferior nor superior, to Gold Bond\nR, when used in polyvinyl or ethylene vinyl acetate latex flat paints. PX-16.\n\n      On February 9, 1987, Mr. Simonson submitted a Plan Of Operations (“POO”) 17 to the\nBLM to mine approximately 100,000 tons per year from El Paso and Big Jim Lode claims. JSF\n¶ 7.\n\n        On March 1, 1987, Steve Ryland, Mr. Simonson’s geological consultant, provided BLM\nwith an addendum to the POO. PX-42. On March 3, 1987, Rheoforce filed an Application for\nan Environmental Assessment, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\n(“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321, requiring federal agencies to provide environmental reports and\nanalysis requirements when undertaking “major Federal actions significantly affecting the\nquality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C); PX-21 (March 3, 1987 Environmental\nAssessment). In March 1987, DL Laboratories also completed testing on “Reoforce pumicite,” to\n“evaluate [the] natural glass fillers submitted by [Reoforce] as partial replacements for titanium\ndioxide in an Interior Latex Flat Paint.” PX-19. Those results determined that “Reoforce\npumicite” could serve as a replacement for Titanium Oxide (“Ti02”) in certain paint\nformulations. PX-19 (“Based upon the results of this limited study, it appears that both the 16\nand 30 micron glass fillers evaluated have potential as replacements for titanium dioxide in paint\nformulations.”). In April 1987, DL Laboratories conducted additional testing, indicating that\n“Reoforce pumicite” could be used as a filler in paint and replace between 5–10% Ti02, without\ndecreasing opacity. PX-42. As a result, Mr. Simonson scheduled mining operations to\ncommence in May 1987 that were expected to yield an annual production of 100,000 tons by\n1989. JX-06.\n\n       On May 20, 1987, the BLM issued an Environmental Assessment concluding that\nReoforce’s proposed mine development would not “result in a significant adverse impact to the\nenvironment, and therefore . . . that an Environmental Impact Statement [was not] . . . required\nunder [NEPA.]” PX-21.\n\n        On May 28, 1987, the BLM, however, conditionally approved Reoforce’s POO and\naddendum, subject to twenty stipulations, including that the “material, pumicite, approved for\nextraction under this [POO] is suspected by [the BLM] as not being subject to location under the\nGeneral Mining Laws” but that a determination of that question would be made at an unspecified\ntime. PX-22. Mr. Simonson specifically was advised that, although “[y]our [POO] . . . has been\napproved,” Stipulation 1 states that, at some later time, the BLM will determine “whether the\nmining and removal of [pumicite] is permitted under the authority of the General Mining Law[.]”\n\n       17\n          The BLM requires claimants to submit a POO “before beginning operations greater\nthan casual use.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(a). The BLM may revoke an approved POO, if an\noperator violates provisions in the POO. Generally, the BLM will not approve a POO until a\nmineral examination is conducted to determine whether a mining claim is valid.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fPX-22. In addition, the BLM advised that if pumicite is not locatable under the General Mining\nLaw, but was mined under an approved POO, Mr. Simonson would be required to pay a per-ton\nroyalty rate to the BLM based on prevailing market conditions. PX-24 (explaining that,\nregardless of the outcome of the uncommon/common variety determination, Mr. Simonson “will\nin no way [be] preclude[d] or prevent[ed]” from mining his claims). Mr. Simonson decided it\nwould be prudent not to begin mining until the BLM completed its common/uncommon variety\ndetermination. 9/16/13 TR 105–06 (Simonson).\n\n        On June 26, 1987, the BLM conducted a field examination of the Reoforce mining claims\nto ascertain whether the pumicite was a common variety and not “locatable.” PX-42. But, on\nJuly 2, 1987, the BLM sent a letter to Mr. Simonson to clarify “some confusion, misconception,\nand anxiety,” arising from Stipulation 1 in the May 28, 1987 approval and advise that, “[t]o put it\nsimply, your mining plan of operation has been approved[.]” PX-24. But, the July 2, 1987 letter\nalso stated that the BLM would, at some time in the future, “make a common/uncommon variety\ndetermination.” PX-24. 19\n\n        On September 4, 1987, Mr. Simonson received preliminary test results from Dr. Steven\nBlazey of A. Schulman Inc. (“Schulman”), an international supplier of high-performance plastic\ncompounds and resins. Dr. Blazey indicated that “Reoforce pumicite” was a “high quality\nspecialty silicate which imparts very good antiblock properties 20 to high quality polyolefin\nfilms,” and asked whether “Reoforce pumicite” was approved by the United States Food and\nDrug Administration (“FDA”) for consumer use. DX-74.\n\n\n       19\n            An undated memorandum from BLM’s California Desert District Manager to the\nBLM’s California State Director that appears to be of contemporaneous origin, explained that\nthis situation placed Mr. Simonson in precarious position:\n\n       Unfortunately, this puts the operator in a predicament since the feasibility of his\n       operation rests [on] being able to access this material under some form of\n       appropriation. In addition, the operator is claiming that the use and qualities of\n       the pumicite warrants an “uncommon variety” determination. . . . If the operator\n       proceeds under his plan, he risks a possible adverse determination and possible\n       trespass action.\n\nPX-28. Accordingly, the District Manager recommended that a BLM mineralogist be assigned\nto “expedite a determination of the common variety of the subject pumicite.” PX-28.\n       20\n           Antiblocking agents, also known as antiblock, are additives commonly used in plastic\nfilms and are designed to “create[] space between 2 plastic layers (surface roughness), preventing\nso-called blocking.” A. Schulman Europe, Additive Antiblock, http://www.aschulman.com/\nEurope/Masterbatch/CategoryPlusFunctionality/84096/3/Additive-Antiblock.aspx (last visited\nSept. 30, 2014); see also PX-111 (August 1994 paper written by Dr. Steven Blazey and Dr.\nValerie A. Hill, describing antiblock as “inorganic mineral or organic particles (of certain\nparticle size) which are compatible with [low-density polyethylene] and are added into films to\nroughen the surface and permit air to enter to allow easy separation of the film layers.”).\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f        In October 1987, Mr. Simonson also decided to develop an underground pumicite mine\non the twenty-three placer mining claims previously located (El Paso 1 through El Paso 23) and\nstarted the Rheoforce Filler Company, subsequently incorporated as the Rheoforce Corporation.\nJSF ¶ 2. At this time, “Mr. Simonson was the company’s sole officer and shareholder.” Id. In\nOctober 1987, Mr. Simonson also hired Abel Banhov as a consultant to complete a Business\nPlan for Reoforce focused on generating investor interest to obtain “financing of $4,000,000 to\nbring [Reoforce] to commercial reality.” PX-3. The Business Plan outlined strategic steps that\nReoforce needed to take to compete in select markets and synthesized testing results obtained to\ndate, including information pumicite deposits on the twenty-three unpatented placer mining\nclaims. PX-3. The Business Plan also included information and analysis suggesting that\n“Reoforce pumicite” could be used as a substitute for 5% to 10% of the Ti02, that was used, at\nthe time, as a “hiding pigment [to increase opacity] . . . in paint, ink, rubber, paper and plastics.”\nPX-3.\n\n       Sometime in 1987, Mr. Simonson also began discussing the potential sale of Reoforce to\nPlacer Dome US, a large commercial mining company. 9/16/13 TR 161–63 (Simonson). At that\ntime, Placer Dome US allegedly offered Mr. Simonson $100,000 to purchase the Reoforce\ndeposit that Mr. Simonson refused. 9/16/13 TR 163 (Simonson).\n\n       In February 1988, DL Laboratories also performed other tests to evaluate “Reoforce\npumicite” as a replacement for calcined clay in ceiling paint and concluded:\n\n         1. Based upon the results of this study, [Reoforce] 16 Micron Glass Filler is\n         essentially equivalent in performance to Huber 70C to the extent tested.\n\n         2. [Reoforce] 16 Micron Glass Filler exhibits slightly higher opacity and re-\n         wetted opacity.\n\nPX-26.\n\n       In March or April 1988, Mr. Simonson and Carl Engelhardt, a retained consultant,\nformulated four different paints using “Reoforce pumicite” in the 16 micron size, to reduce the\nuse of Ti02. DX-94; PX-32. In an April 13, 1988 letter to Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C.,\nMr. Engelhardt estimated that using “Reoforce pumicite” could save between 10 and 17 pounds\nof Ti02/100 gallons. PX-29. But, he clarified that, to obtain the maximum Ti02 savings using\n“Reoforce pumicite,” it was necessary to add the pumicite “in the letdown [phase] at slow speed\nfor 5 minutes[.]” PX-29.\n\n        In June or July 1988, Mr. Simonson had preliminary discussions with Engelhard\nCorporation about a partnership with “respect to future commercial development of [Reoforce]\nas a company, and [“Reoforce pumicite”] as a product line.” PX-30. Thereafter, John Thies, a\nFidelity Management employee with responsibility for overseeing investments in the plastics\nfield and an “adviser” to Mr. Simonson, explained to Engelhard Corporation that any partnership\nwith Reoforce must have two non-negotiable requirements: (1) Mr. Simonson and Mr. Thies had\nto maintain majority ownership of Reoforce and “control of the reserves through early\ncommercial development;” and (2) Mr. Simonson and Mr. Thies required project financing. PX-\n30; 9/16/13 TR 118–21 (Simonson); PX-31 (July 14, 1998 letter from Mr. Simonson to\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fEngelhard Corporation). Engelhard Corporation responded that successful development of\nReoforce would take several years of testing, analysis, and market development, and that Mr.\nSimonson would need to “cede control of all aspects of the project at the outset.” PX-30. Mr.\nSimonson decided not to pursue a partnership with Engelhard Corporation. 9/16/13 TR 122\n(Simonson). In an unaddressed August 1, 1988 marketing letter, Mr. Engelhardt explained that\n“testing has shown that [“Reoforce pumicite”] will produce equal or better paint quality and\ndepending upon the [pigment volume concentrate (“PVC”)] an 8 to 20% of additional savings of\nTitanium Dioxide with lower raw material costs.” PX-32. Thereafter, Mr. Engelhardt promoted\n“Reoforce pumicite” as an extender and partial replacement for Ti02 to various paint companies.\nPX-29; PX-32; PX42; DX-94 (all letters from Engelhardt describing positive attributes of\n“Reoforce pumicite”).\n\n        During the summer of 1988, Mr. Simonson also sent a batch of “Reoforce pumicite” to\nSuntec Paint Inc. (“Suntec”), a paint company that had been searching “for an extender which\nwould provide [them] with further savings of Ti02 without affecting the physical properties of\n[their] latex flat [paint] formulations.” PX-34. In August 1988, Suntec tested “Reoforce\npumicite” to make a “one hundred (100) gallon plant batch of [the] popular P.V.A. Latex Flat\nWhite Base [paint] at 65 PVC.” PX-34. Typically, the formula for this paint contained 125\npounds of Ti02 and 50 pounds of Silica. PX-34. In this batch, however, Suntec used 110 pounds\nof Ti02 and 50 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite,” in place of the silica, and concluded that the\nbatch made with “Reoforce pumicite” was equal in performance to the standard formula and\nproduced “a savings of 15 lbs. of Ti02 and a savings of 5 cents per gallon (with Rheolite 16M at\n.25/lb.).” PX-34. Subsequently, Suntec inquired when “Reoforce pumicite” in the 16 Micron\nsize would be available to commercial paint manufacturers. PX-34.\n\n       On September 23, 1988, Mr. Engelhardt wrote a letter to the Engelhard Corporation\nestimating that using “Reoforce pumicite” in paint formulations could save a paint company\napproximately 5 to 40 cents per gallon, assuming that the price of “Reoforce pumicite” was 25\ncents per pound and Ti02 was 99 cents per pound. PX-42.\n\n       In December 1988, Dr. Blazey of Schulman advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce\npumicite” perhaps could be used as an “antiblock in polyolefin film packaging,” and requested to\nbe apprised of the continued development and production capabilities of Reoforce. DX-69.\n\n       In a January 10, 1989 letter, Suntec Paint explained that it was willing to purchase\n“Reoforce pumicite” (16 Micron size) at $400 per ton (20 cents per pound), because it could save\nseven cents per gallon if “Reoforce pumicite” could be purchased at that price. PX-37. But,\nSuntec subsequently withdrew its interest in Reoforce. DX-189.\n\n       On February 24, 1989, PRA Laboratories performed tests that showed “Reoforce\npumicite” could save 15% of Ti02 per gallon of flax white latex base paint. PX-38; PX-39.\n\n      By April 1989, Mr. Simonson located and claimed title to 23 additional unpatented placer\nmining claims (known as the El Paso placer claims) and one unpatented lode mining claim\n(known as the Big Jim Lode claim). PX-42.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       On May 10, 1989, Lindsay Finishes Inc. advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite”\ncould save paint manufacturers approximately 28 to 30 cents per pound by using less Ti02. PX-\n41.\n\n        On May 20, 1989, based on a geological field examination, BLM finalized a Mineral\nReport about “Reoforce pumicite” deposits on the El Paso and Big Jim Lode claims (“1989\nMineral Report”). PX-42. The 1989 Mineral Report stated that “Reoforce pumicite” was “an\nuncommon variety and that its proposed use, and all of the potential uses, except soil\nconditions . . . clearly fall within a category of uncommon uses,” and a locatable mineral under\nthe General Mining Law. PX-42. It also determined that “Reoforce pumicite” could be used as\na pigment-extender for latex flat paints, potentially serving as a partial replacement for Ti02.\nPX-42 (reporting that this pumicite “will replace Ti02 for about 5 to 10% by weight and 35 to\n40% by volume, maintain a low luster (sheen) in contrast to Si02, enhance scrubbability, reduce\nweight, maintain opacity and whiteness, and cost less than Ti02”); PX-42 (listing the unique\nproperties of “Reoforce pumicite,” as “light weight, small grain size, low luster, opacity,\ndurability, scrub resistance, whiteness, and so forth,” and that it also could be used as an abrasive\nadditive). But the 1989 Mineral Report did not conclude that Mr. Simonson made a discovery of\na valuable mineral deposit under the General Mining Law and was not a validity determination. 21\nPX-42:012 (“The purpose of this study and report is to document the particulars of the common\nvariety aspects of pumicite for use in latex flat paints. This is a common variety determination\nreport and not a mining claim validity report.” 22 (emphasis added)); JSF ¶ 9. 23\n\n       On October 20, 1989, Mr. Simonson wrote to the FDA to ascertain whether “Reoforce\npumicite” could be used as a filler and antiblocking agent for certain kinds of polyolefin films\nused for packaging food. On March 12 and April 25, 1990, that inquiry was supplemented. PX-\n49; 9/16/13 TR 109, 148 (Simonson).\n\n        On October 24, 1989, BLM’s Area Manager of the Ridgecrest Office advised Mr.\nSimonson of the 1989 Mineral Report and approved Reoforce’s 1987 POO that would expire in\nfive years, i.e., by October 24, 1994. PX-42.\n\n\n\n       21\n         The General Mining Law “authorizes American citizens to ‘locate’ valid mining claims\nafter ‘discovery’ of valuable mineral deposits and compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements.” Vane Minerals (US), LLC v. United States, 116 Fed. Cl. 48, 55 (2014) (citing\nChrisman v. Miller, 197 U.S. 313, 322–23 (1905)).\n       22\n          One of the ways that the BLM determines whether a mining claimant has made a\ndiscovery of a valuable mineral deposit is through a “valid existing rights determination.” Vane\nMinerals, 116 Fed. Cl. at 57. Such a determination also is referred to as a “validity examination”\nor “a mining claim validity report.” PX-42.\n       23\n       On July 6, 1989, the 1989 Mineral Report was “reviewed and acknowledged” by the\nBLM’s Associate District Manager, California Desert District, and was considered finalized.\nPX-42.\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f       On February 20, 1990, English China Clay, Inc. (“English Clay”) also tested “Reoforce\npumicite” and concluded that:\n\n       The [“Reoforce pumicite”] gives a slight dirty and yellow cask to the paint.\n       Because of this, the amount of [“Reoforce pumicite”] that can be used to replace\n       the Ti02 has to be limited to ~10% or lower.\n\nDX-94.\n\n         Around this time, the Technical Service Manager for English Clay also wrote several\nletters or communicated with Mr. Simonson and Placer Dome U.S., that it also was analyzing the\ncharacteristics of “Reoforce pumicite” to determine the potential value of a business relationship\nwith Reoforce. DX-94.\n\n        On August 16, 1990, the FDA advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite” was\n“relatively inert,” so that it was not necessary for him to submit additional information or file a\n“food additive petition.” PX-49.\n\n        On May 30, 1991, Sovereign Gold Ltd. (“SG”), an Australian mining company proposed\na joint venture with Mr. Simonson to develop “Reoforce pumicite,” but stated that a successful\ncommercial mining operation “requires much effort to carry from inception to the commercial\nstage.” PX-55. Specifically, SG proposed to: (1) develop “a comprehensive business plan for\nthe project” that included technical and business details, mining and processing plans, marketing\nplans, and a five year capital and operating budget that would be used to “develop financing for\nthe project;” (2) allow Mr. Simonson to be “principally involved” in the marketing efforts, but\nSG would be responsible for “developing mine and construction plans, executing those plans,”\nand managing the project prior to its commercial stage; and (3) manage the entire “pre-\ncommercial” phase of the project through a management committee, but allow Reoforce\n“complete input,” if SG’s decision would be “final and binding on both parties in the event of\ndispute.” PX-55. In exchange, Mr. Simonson needed to grant SG a two-year option on 50%\ninterest of the project. PX-55. Mr. Simonson rejected that proposal. See 9/16/13 TR 154\n(Simonson).\n\n        In June 1991, Edward F. McCarthy, a well-known executive in the industrial minerals\nbusiness, completed a report analyzing potential markets for products utilizing “Reoforce\npumicite” (“the McCarthy Report”). PX-56. 25 The McCarthy Report concluded that:\n(1) milled 26 “Reoforce pumicite” had the potential to capture approximately 55,000 tons per year\n       25\n          It is unclear whether Mr. Simonson commissioned the McCarthy Report or whether it\nwas a project conducted for Cyprus Minerals. Compare 9/18/13 TR 849 (Davis) (“Q. “And it’s\nyour assumption that [the McCarthy Report] was an independent report, correct? A. [Mr.\nMcCarthy] told me it was an independent report.”), with 9/16/13 TR 156–58 (Simonson)\n(explaining that he paid Mr. McCarthy $2,000 to obtain “his honest opinion about the [pumicite]\nand what he felt he would do as a marketing person”).\n       26\n          In this context, “milled” means products “finer than 50 mesh and does not include\nconstruction aggregates, brick clays or glass sands.” PX-56.\n\n\n                                                15\n\f“at an average realization ex mill of close to $200 per ton;” (2) major market opportunities for\n“Reoforce pumicite” were in coatings, but “Reoforce pumicite” could compete successfully in\nniche markets in plastics, rubber, and friction materials; and (3) based on the foregoing, Reoforce\ncould generate an estimated annual revenue of $10.9 million dollars. PX-56. But, the McCarthy\nReport cautioned that these conclusions would require that Reoforce engage in a “significant\nsales effort,” undertake “significant technical and developmental support,” and sell competitively\npriced products, assuming no significant changes in the regulatory atmosphere vis-à-vis\ncrystalline silica and Volatile Organic Carbon. PX-56.\n\n        On July 8, 1991, English Clay observed that “Reoforce pumicite” would “primarily\ncompete with crystalline silicas, feldspar, and (possibly) barytes as an extender for paint and\nother coatings. While [Reoforce pumicite’s] brightness is not extraordinary in its natural form, it\nis quite acceptable for use in primers and intermediate coats.” PX-436. In addition, English\nClay observed that” Reoforce pumicite” potentially could compete with other types of fillers and\nextenders, such as talcs, wallastonites, nepheline syenite, and diatomaceous earth. PX-436. But,\nit also warned that the “carcinogenicity of crystalline silica has not become a major issue in the\nmineral filler/extender market place” and, although “Reoforce pumicite’s” amorphous structure\nwas a “major selling point” in the past, “[t]oday, it is relatively unimportant.” PX-436.\n\n         On October 9, 1991, Norwegian Talc sent a letter to Mr. Simonson stating that “[a]ll\nparties agree in principle that your amorphous silica is unique in its properties and geological\ncomposition, and represent[s] a unique opportunity in the ever-increasing need to replace\ncrystalline silica in a variety of end applications[.]” PX-67. But, the letter cautioned that the\npotential applications of “Reoforce pumicite” “need to be studied in more detail in order to\nquantify the amounts of material that can be sold in the next 5–10 years.” PX-67. Further, this\nletter outlined several “steps to introduce and commercialize” “Reoforce pumicite,” including\ncustom grinding of the material in 6, 15, 45, and 60 plus micron sizes for uses as an antiblock, a\nfiller in paints and plastics, and as a “purging compound.” PX-67. And, the letter further\nexplained that Norwegian Talc’s interest in “Reoforce pumicite” was conditioned on several\nassumptions and revisions to Mr. Simonson’s business plan. PX-67 (explaining that Norwegian\nTalc’s interest was “under the assumption that [Mr. Simonson had] adequate resources, that you\nhave met all legal requirements, that you comply with all prevailing laws and regulations, and\nthat the material meets all relevant safety standards[.]”); id. (“In our view, the investment figures\nyou presented in your business plan . . . should be critically reviewed and updated.”). 27\n\n        On October 20, 1991, the Technical Service Manager for English Clay sent another letter\nto Placer Dome U.S. describing the “Reoforce pumicite” deposit as “unique,” with market\npotential, because it had a very low level of crystalline silica and “will have an application in the\npaint and plastics markets. . . . , probably be useful in caulks and sealants. . . . , [and] possibly be\nusable in inks, textiles, [and] fiberglass reinforced polyester (FRP) applications.” PX-68. But,\n“Reoforce pumicite” “would compete on a segmental basis with products that [Placer Dome\nwas] currently involved in selling/developing.” PX-68.\n\n       27\n          Sometime in 1991, Placer Dome resurrected its interest in exploring a joint venture\nwith Reoforce. PX-66 (describing interest by Placer Dome in jointly developing Reoforce\nmining claims with Norwegian Talc Minerals).\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f        On November 12, 1991, Placer Dome forwarded to Mr. Simonson “an analysis of two\ndifferent ways in which [Reoforce] can be established from marketing, production and technical\nviewpoints.” PX-70. First, Reoforce should focus its initial marketing endeavors on\nopportunities in the commercial coatings market, as the development work necessary to succeed\nin that market is “relatively straight forward; the required testing equipment is relatively\ninexpensive; and sales aids can be easily prepared for this market.” PX-70. Second, a\npartnership was proposed with Reoforce. PX-70 (explaining that working with Reoforce on a\n“partnering basis . . . would be a good example of an approach that could be taken once\nspecifications were established for a product that could be produced consistently”).\n\n      On December 5, 1991, Mr. Simonson submitted an amendment to the approved May 20,\n1987 POO to increase tonnage to 200,000 tons per year. JX-22.\n\n        On January 10, 1992, Placer Dome proposed a detailed arrangement to jointly “go\nforward with development of the [Reoforce] property as soon as possible” as it “holds the best\nchance for resolving land title issues” relating to the Reoforce mining claims. PX-76. The\nproposal explained that, “from [Placer Dome’s] viewpoint, numerous uncertainties surround the\nproject, not least of which is the apparent serious inadequacy of [Reoforce’s] title to the\nclaims . . . [which] is a serious obstacle to making a substantial investment with confidence.”\nPX-76 (emphasis added). It also provided that Placer Dome would “stake string lode\nclaims . . . along the outcrop of the pumicite bed in order to secure extralateral rights,” have 20\nacre placer claims staked over Mr. Simonson’s existing 40 acre claims to “negate any possible\nfuture challenge” to Reoforce claims, and, when “the title issues are resolved, [all] claims will be\nassignable to [Placer Dome], or to Simonson if [Placer Dome] later withdraws.” PX-76. Placer\nDome also indicated that it might, at some unidentified time, initiate a quiet title action to\nReoforce mining claims but require that Mr. Simonson indemnify Placer Dome for any “possible\nadverse outcome” from that action. PX-76. In addition, if Placer Dome was “satisfied with [Mr.\nSimonson’s] title to the property,” then it would have the option to explore and develop the\nproperty in return for an 80% equity interest in the property. PX-76. After Placer Dome\nobtained title to the Reoforce mining claims, it agreed to “retain [Mr.] Simonson’s services as\nconsultant and contractor for the marketing and sale of [the] product” for a period of three years\nat an annual rate of $100,000, with the option to renew for additional years. PX-76. And, on\ncommencement of commercial production, Placer Dome agreed to:\n\n       [m]ake a one-time payment to [Mr.] Simonson of $100,000 for every 10,000 short\n       tons of annual production (based upon the annual production as recommended in\n       [a] feasibility study ) capped at a sum of $500,000. In the event of an increase in\n       annual production beyond the initial production for which [Mr.] Simonson\n       received payment under this provision, [Mr.] Simonson shall receive an additional\n       one time payment of $100,000 for every incremental 10,000 annual tons of\n       production, still subject to the same total cap of $500,000.\n\nPX-76. In addition, Placer Dome agreed that Mr. Simonson would retain a 20% working interest\nin the property, if he provided Placer Dome with a right of first refusal and agreed to sell his\ninterest. PX-76. Mr. Simonson declined that offer. 9/16/13 TR 164 (Simonson). Thereafter, the\nPresident of Placer Dome contacted Mr. Simonson to express an interest in coming to San\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fFrancisco, California to discuss Placer Dome’s continuing interest in Reoforce. 9/16/13 TR 165\n(Simonson). Mr. Simonson refused. 9/16/13 TR 165 (Simonson).\n\n      On February 19, 1992, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that a New Environmental\nAssessment was required “because of the proposed increase in the scale of operation[.]” PX-78.\n\n        Around March 1992, General Electric Silicones (“GE Silicones”) inquired whether it\ncould perform a plant evaluation of “Reoforce pumicite” and requested a minimum of 500\npounds (maximum of 750 pounds) to “verify the physical property profile, including shelf life\nand application testing” of the pumicite. DX-61. GE Silicones indicated that if this testing were\nsuccessful, it may require “around 10,000lbs of [“Reoforce pumicite”] per week, rising to 20,000\nlbs. per week within 1 year.” DX-61. This interest was based on the carcinogenic nature of\ncrystalline silicas. DX-61 (“Based on the . . . known health problems with crystalline silicas,\n[General Electric Silicones is] interested in evaluating these volcanic glasses.”). In response, Mr.\nSimonson extracted approximately 750 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite” from the portal area\nusing a compressor as a jackhammer. 9/16/13 TR 88 (Simonson) (“So we went out physically,\nand we bagged [the pumicite] up again . . . . [and] I supplied 750 pounds of a precise\nmaterial[.]”). After testing how “Reoforce pumicite” could repel the absorption of water, GE\nSilicones subsequently created a finished silicone spray, using pumicite in lieu of Min-U-Sil, a\nfine ground silica product used by GE Silicones. 9/16/13 TR 91 (Simonson); see also US Silica,\nFine Ground Silica, http://www.ussilica.com/products/fine-ground-silica (last visited Sept. 29,\n2014) (describing the benefits of silica). But, GE Silicones never executed any purchase orders\nfrom Mr. Simonson. 9/17/13 TR 513–14 (Simonson).\n\n        On May 8, 1992, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that, based on the level of disturbance\nassociated with the Reoforce mines, a SMARA Reclamation Plan and bond were required. JX-\n21. The BLM also explained that, because of an “access road . . . recently constructed on the Big\nJim Lode Claim,” Reoforce was not in compliance with Stipulations 3 and 7 of the 1987 POO,\nbut did not issue a Notice of Non-Compliance. JX-21.\n\n        On May 18, 1992, the BLM issued a supplemental Environmental Assessment of\nReoforce’s 1991 proposed modification to the 1987 POO. PX-85. BLM explained that the\nproposed modification would increase the authorized production tonnage to 200,000 tons,\nresulting in an increase in the number of truck trips from 16 to 32. PX-85. Nevertheless, the\nBLM determined that the “direct and indirect of the proposed action are not significantly\ndifferent than those identified in the [Environmental Assessment].” PX-85. Therefore, the BLM\nconcluded that Reoforce’s amended POO would have no significant adverse impact on the\nenvironment, so that no Environmental Impact Statement was required under the NEPA. PX-85.\n\n        On May 21, 1992, the BLM approved the BLM’s supplemental environmental\nassessment, and informed Mr. Simonson that he was required to abide by the May 28, 1987 POO\nand five new stipulations to minimize impact on the desert tortoise. JX-22. Several of these\nstipulations, however, required “approval from BLM before any enlargement of the portal area,\nroad construction, or underground mining may begin.” JX-22.\n\n       On August 6, 1992, the Kern County Planning and Development Services Department\ninformed Mr. Simonson that the Reoforce mining claims “would not come under the\n\n\n                                                18\n\frequirements of [SMARA] as [they] did not disturb more than an acre of surface area.” JX-23.\nKern County advised, however, that if the project expanded in scope, a reclamation plan would\nbe necessary. JX-23.\n\n       On November 18, 1992, Dr. Blazey of Schulman wrote Mr. Simonson a letter to express\npreliminary interest in using “Reoforce pumicite” as an antiblocking agent based on “some\npreliminary investigation,” because the small micron size of “Reoforce pumicite”\n\n         works very well as an antiblock in oriented propylene films. These[] results are\n         promising in lieu of the current use of synthetic silica which is priced at between\n         $1.60 and $2.00 per pound. The market for synthetic silica in oriented propylene\n         films is several million pounds per year. Although [“Reoforce pumicite”] may\n         not completely overtake this market, the use of this material offers a definite\n         cost/performance advantage over current synthetic silica.\n\nPX-96.\n\n        Mr. Blazey also indicated that “Reoforce pumicite” had potential in other applications in\npaints and plastics. PX-96. Although natural silica was the “industry standard,” in Dr. Blazey’s\nopinion, the non-carcinogenic characteristics of “Reoforce pumicite” placed it in an\nadvantageous market position. PX-96 (explaining that “Reoforce pumicite” showed “some\ninitial promise” as an antiblocking agent, because “natural silica . . . contains high levels of\ncrystalline quartz and crystabolite which are potential carcinogens”).\n\n      On January 8, 1993, the BLM inspected the Reoforce mining claims to determine\nwhether the mine portal area and adjacent roads negatively impacted the desert tortoise. DX-17.\n\n        On February 1, 1993, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that he needed to submit\n“information required by Stipulations No. 5 and 8 of [Reoforce’s May 28, 1987] approved plan\n[of operations] to [the BLM] as a proposed mine plan modification.” DX-17. Specifically,\nStipulation 5 required that Reoforce submit detailed engineering plans “prior to enlargement of\nthe portal area and road construction” and Stipulation 8 required that Reoforce’s POO was\nsubject to approval of a “comprehensive road maintenance program,” if and when Reoforce\nbegan commercially to mine its claims. PX-22.\n\n        In March and April 1993, approximately six years after the BLM approved Reoforce’s\nPOO on May 28, 1987, Mr. Simonson cleared the “portal area” or “staging area” on the south-\neasterly end of the El Paso 6 claim (later relocated as El Paso 6A), portions of the Big Jim Lode\nclaim, and the El Paso 22 placer claim (later relocated as El Paso 22A). JSF ¶ 11. This work\nincluded blasting and grading. JSF ¶ 11.\n\n       In May 1993, a Mining Engineer and Professor at the Colorado School of Mines,\ncompleted an Underground Pumicite Mine Conceptual Design Report, commissioned by Mr.\nSimonson (the “1993 Colorado Mining Report”). PX-103. Based on the 1993 Colorado Mining\nReport, Mr. Simonson decided to mine the Reoforce claims, using a “room and pillar” method 29\n         29\n          Room and pillar mining is a system where material is extracted across a horizontal\nplane, creating an array of horizontal rooms and pillars. “Pillars” of untouched mined material\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fthat previously was used on the Cudahy or the Old Dutch Cleanser Mine. 9/16/13 TR 147–48\n(Simonson). The 1993 Colorado Mining Report explained that this method was “designed to\nproduce a high purity, uncontaminated, product by mechanically mining excavations entirely\nwithin the pumicite.” PX-103. Mr. Simonson decided instead to use a large-scale cleaner to\n“vacuum the material out so it would never be exposed to quartz crystalline. It would go directly\ninto the vacuum cleaner and then drop down into a 70-ton hopper[,]” several thousand feet from\nthe mine. 9/16/13 TR 197, 348–49 (Simonson).\n\n       On July 18, 1994, Dr. Blazey sent Mr. Simonson a fax to follow-up on the progress of the\nmining and grinding of “Reoforce pumicite.” PX-109. Therein, Dr. Blazey stated that although\na competitor of Schulman, Techmer PM, expressed an interest in “Reoforce pumicite,” Dr.\nBlazey “want[ed] A. Schulman to be the first to advertise and get this material on the market for\nsale.” PX-109; see also 9/19/13 TR 1072 (Blazey).\n\n       On August 4, 1994, Mr. Simonson renamed Rheoforce Corporation as Reoforce, Inc.\nunder the laws of the State of Delaware. JSF ¶ 15. Later that month, Kern County informed Mr.\nSimonson that, should the Reoforce mines disturb in excess of one-acre, a reclamation plan was\nrequired under SMARA. JX-28. Mr. Simonson did not submit a reclamation plan. 9/16/13 TR\n189 (Simonson).\n\n        Between August 10 and 11, 1994, Dr. Blazey, in collaboration with Dr. Valerie Hill of\nSchulman, presented a paper to the Clemson University Technical Conference (“the 1994\nPaper”) on the potential for replacing crystalline silica in polyethylene films. PX-111. This\npaper analyzed the performance characteristics of different antiblocking substances, including an\nunnamed “natural silica (volcanic glass).” It concluded that an unidentified “natural silica\n(volcanic glass)” exhibited equal antiblocking performance to the industry standard crystalline\nsilica and was not hazardous. PX-111. 31\n\n       On August 31, 1994, however, Mr. Simonson failed to pay the BLM statutorily-mandated\nmaintenance fees for the El Paso placer claims, Big Jim Lode claim, and mill site claims, so that\nthe BLM declared these claims were forfeited by operation of law. JSF ¶ 12.\n\n       On September 26, 1994, Mr. Simonson and Ronald Stehn re-identified and relocated\ntwenty-three placer mining claims that they named “El Paso 1A” through “El Paso 23A.” JSF\n¶ 13. Each “A” claim corresponded with the original El Paso mining claims that Mr. Simonson\n\n\n\n\nare left in place to support the roof of mine, while the “rooms” are extracted before the pillars are\npartially extracted. See Kentucky Geological Survey, Methods of Mining, http://www.uky.edu\n/KGS/coal/coal_mining.htm (last visited Sept. 29, 2014).\n       31\n         At trial, Dr. Blazey could not recall whether the “natural silica,” referenced in the 1994\nPaper was “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/19/13 TR 1074. Dr. Blazey admitted, however, that the 1994\nPaper was prepared at the time that Schulman was testing “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/19/13 TR\n1074 (Blazey).\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\flocated between 1983 and 1985. JSF ¶ 13. 33 These claims occupied “the identical location as\nthe lapsed claims, consisting of approximately 920 acres.” PX-439. 34\n\n        On January 25, 1995, Schulman sent Mr. Simonson a purchase order for 5,000 pounds of\n“Reoforce pumicite,” size R-100, at a price of $330/ton. PX-116. On March 17, 1995,\nSchulman sent another purchase order for 5,000 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite” size R-106, at a\nprice of $475/metric ton. PX-121. These purchase orders were issued to perform batch testing\nand generate sample formulations of plastic compounds using “Reoforce pumicite” to send to A.\nSchulman’s customers. 9/19/13 TR 1063–64 (Blazey). In the Spring of 1995, Reoforce mined\napproximately 200 tons of the pumicite, in part to fulfill orders from Schulman. 9/17/13 TR 426\n(Simonson). At trial, however, neither Mr. Simonson nor Dr. Blazey could remember if\nSchulman ever conducted testing on “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/17/13 TR 433 (Simonson).\n\n        Sometime in early 1995, Mr. Simonson decided that “Reoforce pumicite” would have to\nbe ground to particular micron sizes for different potential applications. 9/16/13 TR 228\n(Simonson). To accomplish this objective, Mr. Simonson purchased ball mill, refurbished the\nengines, cleaned out the lines and processing area, and purchased ceramic balls to crush material\ninto a uniform size. 35 9/16/13 TR 212–15 (Simonson). Mr. Simonson also arranged to transport\n“Reoforce pumicite” to the ball mill in Victorville, California. 9/16/13 TR 217 (Simonson).\nThereafter, Mr. Simonson entered into a contractual arrangement with ProTech Minerals,\n\n       33\n           Although those claims had different numbering than predecessor claims, the BLM\ntreated the May 28, 1987 POO as “fully applicable” to the “El Paso A” claims. PX-439 (“The\nparties agree that the previously approved [POO] are fully applicable to the [new El Paso “A”]\nclaims[.]”).\n       34\n          In November 1994, the BLM prepared to transfer title of certain designated lands to the\nState, but the State declined to accept title of any pre-existing mining claims. JSF ¶ 17; see also\n62 FED. REG. at 26324-01 (withdrawing lands on which the Reoforce mining claims are located\n“[s]ubject to valid existing rights”). The BLM canceled existing patents on the land, and issued a\nnew patent to the State in November 1996, but it omitted all lands encumbered by unpatented\nmining claims. JSF ¶ 17.\n\n        On May 18, 1995, the BLM proposed to withdraw lands designated by Section 701 of the\nCalifornia Desert Protection Act (“Withdrawal Area”) from settlement, sale, location, or entry\nunder the existing land and mineral laws. See Proposed Withdrawal; California, 60 FED. REG.\n26736 (May 18, 1995) (“Proposed Withdrawal”). The purpose of the Proposed Withdrawal was\nto protect values of the designated area until they could be conveyed to California. Id.\nAccordingly, the Proposed Withdrawal “segregated” lands within the area of the Proposed\nWithdrawal, i.e., “close[d] the lands for up to two years from all the public land and mineral laws\nexcept conveyances under [Section] 701 of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 (108\nStat. 4471).” Id.. But, the BLM again emphasized, “[e]xisting rights are not affected by this\nwithdrawal.” 60 FED. REG. at 26736.\n       35\n         A ball mill is a device where material is loaded into a large drum that rotates, moving\nceramic balls to crush the material into a fine powder.\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fwhereby he agreed to pay a fixed fee per-ton of pumicite that was processed or milled at the\nplant. 9/16/13 TR 213−14 (Simonson).\n\n       In the spring of 1995, Mr. Simonson mined approximately 200 tons of pumicite from the\nReoforce claims in order to fulfill the January and March 1995 Schulman purchase orders.\n9/16/13 TR 212, 218; 9/17/13 TR 425−26 (Simonson).\n\n        In June 1995, Mr. Simonson requested that Micromeritics Instrument Corporation\nconduct an analysis of two different sizes of the milled “Reoforce pumicite,” one known as R-\n106 and the other as R-100, to determine whether these samples were uniformly sized and\nsuitable for Schulman orders. PX-128; 9/16/13 TR 228 (Simonson). The test was positive.\n9/16/13 TR 229–30 (Simonson). Thereafter, Mr. Simonson milled 100 tons of the mined\npumicite over a two day period at the Victorville mill into uniform sizes. 9/16/13 TR 218, 228\n(Simonson); 9/17/13 TR 426–27 (Simonson). Mr. Simonson then sold five tons of the processed\nand milled pumicite to Schulman to fill the January and March of 1995 orders, and put the\nremaining 195 tons in a warehouse. 9/17/13 TR 427 (Simonson).\n\n       B.      On August 7, 1995, The Bureau Of Land Management Entered Into A\n               Memorandum Of Understanding With The State Of California.\n\n         On August 7, 1995, the BLM State Office Director and the Director of the California\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to\nprovide for the management and administration of public lands within Red Rock Canyon State\nPark that were designated under Section 701 of the California Desert Protection Act other than\nunpatented mining claims. JX-034 (“The purpose of this MOU is to provide for the management\nand administration of public lands within the Red Rock Canyon State Park that are not conveyed\nto the State [of California] pursuant to Section 701 of the California Desert Protection\nAct . . . due to being encumbered by unpatented mining claims.”). The August 7, 1995 MOU\nexplained that the BLM would conduct validity examinations of the mining claims located in the\nproposed Withdrawal Area “prior to review and approval of any [plan of operations],” in\naccordance with the following procedures:\n\n       Group one – Claims and Sites with no POOs.\n\n       This group is defined as claims and sites with no current activity, and no existing\n       plan. BLM action on these claims and sites will commence when the operator or\n       claimant comes forward with a POO under 43 CFR 3809. At that time, a validity\n       examination will be performed by a certified mineral examiner, to determine if\n       [validity] exists. If it does, the State of California will be notified of the results of\n       the examination, and BLM will proceed to review the POO. If no [validity]\n       exists, the plan shall be denied and a mineral contest issued against the claims\n       [will be initiated], through the BLM State Office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       Group Two – Claims and Sites with Existing POOs for Exploration\n       Activities.\n\n       Existing POOs issued pursuant to 43 CFR 3809 for exploration activities (not for\n       producing mines) are to be suspended until a [validity] determination can be\n       completed by a certified mineral examiner. This suspension is necessary as rights\n       against the United States cannot accrue on or after the date of the CDPA, October\n       31, 1994.\n\n       Group Three – Claims and Sites with Existing POOs for Producing Mines\n\n       This group is restricted to operating mines under existing POOs, those diligently\n       and continuously extracting and marketing ores and related commodities from\n       their mining claims and sites. In these circumstances, [the validity determination]\n       will be preliminarily presumed on an interim basis, by evidence of continuous\n       extraction and marketing of the mineral commodity. These producing mines will\n       be allowed to continue operating, pending final determination of [validity].\n\nJX-34 (MOU) (emphasis added).\n\n       The MOU also outlined the responsibilities of BLM and California for the lands within\nthe proposed Withdrawal Area. JX-34.\n\n        In a July 12, 1995 letter, the BLM’s Acting Director of the Ridgecrest Office informed\nMr. Simonson that a formal MOU with the State was forthcoming and “for every existing\noperation and every proposed operation to occur on unpatented federal mining claims within the\n[Red Rock State] Park, BLM must complete a validity exam of the claims(s) prior to approval of\nthe mining [POO].” DX-19. But the letter stated that “[f]or operations such as yours, you will be\nallowed to continue in accordance with your approved mining [POO] while the validity exam\nprocess is completed for your claims.” DX-19 (emphasis added). 40\n\n        On August 10, 1995, a form letter was sent to all mining claimants with unpatented\nmining claims within the Withdrawal Area, wherein the BLM California State Director advised\nclaimants “how BLM and the State are working cooperatively to meet the intent and spirit of\nCongress to convey [lands covered by the CDPA] to the State, and to detail how lands covered\nwith unpatented mining claims will be managed.” JX-34; 9/16/13 TR 230 (Simonson). The\nletter emphasized that mining claims located in the Withdrawal Area prior to October 31, 1994\n“may have valid existing rights (VER) . . . predicated on the discovery by that date of a valuable\nmineral deposit[.]” JX-34. But, to have valid existing rights, “a miner must at least demonstrate\nthat he or she is mining or could have been mining for a profit before . . . October 31,\n1994. . . . [so that the] mere location of a mining claim, and filing of annual assessment work or\nfees is not sufficient to demonstrate that a discovery mining has been made.” JX-34 (emphasis\n\n\n       40\n          According to Mr. Simonson, he did not receive a copy of that letter until approximately\nten years later through discovery in this case. 9/17/13 TR 355 (Simonson).\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fadded). The BLM also enclosed a copy of the MOU to explain how “valid existing rights will be\nevaluated.” JX-34; 9/16/13 TR 230 (Simonson).\n\n        At trial, Mr. Simonson testified that, when the August 7, 1995 MOU issued, he believed\nthat the Reoforce mining claims fell into Group 2.\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          In my reading, I was in group two [of the MOU], with my\n                              plan of operation [being previously approved] and [the\n                              Reoforce mines] not in full production.\n\n       Q.                     So, why did you think you were in group two?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          I wasn’t in full production.\n\n9/16/13 TR 231; PX-34 (describing requirements for Group 2).\n\n                                             * * *\n\n       Q.                     Mr. Simonson, did you continue mining after August 10th,\n                              199[5]?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON           No. . . .\n\n       THE COURT:             You didn’t take samples out or anything else after that?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          No.\n\n       THE COURT:             Okay. Why?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          Well, I had plenty [of samples] . . . . And also, I felt\n                              strongly that I could not mine.\n\n       THE COURT:             Because?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          A validity exam had to be done.\n\n9/16/13 TR 232−33; JX-34 (explaining, in Group Two, existing plans of operations “issued[,]\npursuant to 43 C.F.R 3809 for exploration activities (not for producing mines) are to be\nsuspended until a [validity] determination can be completed by a certified mineral examiner”).\n\n        At trial, Mr. Simonson acknowledged that he received a copy of the August 7, 1995\nMOU, but stated that the BLM never advised him that he could not continue to mine under the\nexisting POO. 9/17/13 TR 439–42 (Simonson). 41\n\n\n       41\n            An August 1995 internal memorandum from the California BLM State Director\nreflects that: “Verbal direction from California Minerals Deputy State Director to reprioritize the\nSimonson case to a delayed status.” PX-334.\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f       C.     Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Clams After The August\n              7, 1995 Memorandum Of Understanding Was Operational.\n\n        On October 18, 1995, Reoforce received a permit to use underground diesel engines from\nthe California Division of Occupational Safety Office (“Cal OSHA”). PX-142. On October 19,\n1995, Cal OSHA issued a report classifying the Reoforce mine as “Nongassy with Special\nConditions,” i.e., requiring Reoforce to develop testing of the underground environment at the\nstart of each working shift “to detect for adequate oxygen and toxic and explosive gases or\nvapors before anyone enters said environment;” and to ventilate the mines to meet “respirable\ndust requirements.” PX-144. On October 19, 1995, Reoforce became subject to other oversight\nand additional requirements imposed by the Cal OSHA. PX-144 (Cal OSHA Underground\nClassification Report).\n\n        On October 21, 1995, Cal OSHA conducted an inspection at the Reoforce site, and issued\na Notice of No Violation, because Reoforce “filled out and . . . implemented” the required Injury\nand Illness Prevention Program model plan. PX-145.\n\n        On November 13, 1995, the BLM informed Reoforce that, because it exceeded the one-\nacre disturbance threshold under SMARA, a reclamation plan and reclamation bond were\nrequired, but failed to notify Mr. Simonson that the prior May 28, 1987 POO was suspended.\nDX-131; DX-21. 42 Mr. Simonson thought the BLM required a reclamation plan, but he was\nunable to finalize a completed plan at that time or in 1996. 9/17/13 TR 482–83 (Simonson)\n(describing multiple but failed attempts to submit a SMARA reclamation plan).\n\n        Between January 17 and January 20, 1996, Hackworth Drilling Company, Mr. Simonson,\nand Peter Milne drilled two exploratory holes on El Paso 7 (now 7A) at the Reoforce mining\nclaims. DX-156; 9/17/13 TR 491–92 (Simonson). On January 20, 1996, Reoforce also\nconvened a first annual shareholders meeting where a Board of Directors (the “Reoforce Board”)\nand corporate officers were elected, and financial planning, organization, and future business\nwas discussed, including “pending orders, pending legal actions, [and] expected expenditures.”\nDX-177. The meeting notes showed cash on hand was $14,000. DX-177. There is no mention\nthat Reoforce’s May 28, 1987 POO had been suspended. DX-177. Mr. Simonson was forced to\nstep down as the President of Reoforce Inc., and another shareholder, John Foggan, assumed that\nposition. DX-148; DX-177; 9/16/13 TR 253−55 (Simonson). Thereafter Reoforce began to use\nthe name “the Foggan Group.” 9/17/13 TR 414 (Simonson).\n\n       In 1997, the company entered into a joint venture with IMV-Nevada, Bill Wahl, the\nowner and President of the Lime Mountain Company, and a geologist, David Klise, of LOK\nEnvironmental, Inc. JX-40 (proposed joint venture agreement); DX-150 (describing the\n\n       42\n          Mr. Simonson estimated that between 1984 and 1995, he spent around $500,000 to\n$550,000 to develop the mining claims for the commercial production of pumicite as a filler and\nextender in paints and plastics. 9/17/13 TR 405–06 (Simonson). Some of that money was raised\nby Reoforce investors and the rest was Mr. Simonson’s personal money. 9/17/13 TR 496\n(Simonson). But by August 1995, “most of that money had been spent” and no new investors\nwere on the horizon. Id.\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f“contractual arrangement”). The objective of the joint venture was to obtain permits for, and\nbegin to develop, Reoforce mining claims to facilitate “commercial production of [“Reoforce\npumicite”].” On January 12, 1997, Mr. Simonson and Mr. Stehn transferred their interests in El\nPaso 1A through El Paso 23A placer claims, via a quitclaim deed, to Reoforce, Inc. JSF ¶ 21.\n\n       On February 4, 1996, the Reoforce Board discussed a plan “to extract approximately 200\nmore tons of product sometime in late March or April.” DX-187. Again, there was no mention\nthat Reoforce’s POO was suspended at that or any other Board meeting. DX-188 (March 2,\n1996, minutes); DX-189 (April 2, 1996 minutes); DX-190 (Jan. 4, 1997 minutes); DX-191 (Jan.\n29, 1998 minutes); DX-176 (Sept. 16, 2002 minutes). 43 Instead, the notes reflect a company in\ndecline and diminishing business prospects. DX-188 (listing the cash on hand, as of March 2,\n1996, as $8,500); DX-189 (listing the cash on hand, as of April 2, 1996, as $7,500, and the “sale\nof some assets [was required] to maintain corporation while awaiting sale of product” was\nrequired); DX-191 (“No other leads at this time.”).\n\n       D.      On May 13, 1997, The Bureau of Land Management Withdrew Certain\n               Public Lands, “Subject To Valid Existing Rights” And Subsequent Activities\n               Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Claims Until March 2006.\n\n        As anticipated by the August 7, 1995 MOU, on May 13, 1997, BLM finally withdrew the\nlands designated by Section 701 of the CPDA from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the\nUnited States land and mineral laws. See PUBLIC LAND ORDER NO. 7620; WITHDRAWAL OF\nPUBLIC LANDS FOR RED ROCK CANYON STATE PARK; CA, 62 FED. REG. 26324 (May 13, 1997)\n(“This order withdraws 8,896 acres of public lands from all public land and mineral laws[,]\nexcept conveyances under Section 701 of the [CDPA] of 1994, for a period of 20 years to protect\nthe park resources of the lands until they can be conveyed to the State of California as mandated\nby Congress.”). The withdrawal, however, was “subject to [any] valid existing [mineral] rights.”\nId. Although the August 7, 1995 MOOU anticipated conducting a validity determination on all\nmining claims located in the Withdrawal Area, Plaintiffs’ mining claims were never noticed for a\nvalidity hearing. Likewise, the August 7, 1995 MOU anticipated that the validity determinations\nwould be conducted before the BLM would approve of any POO, but Plaintiffs’ May 28, 1987\napproved POO was never rescinded and did not undergo any additional review of Plaintiffs’\nclaims.\n\n       On October 9, 1997, Bill Swanson submitted a Mining Operation Annual Report to the\nCalifornia Department of Conservation that listed the status of the Reoforce mines as “Active.”\nDX-195.\n\n         In late 1997, Kern County informed Reoforce that the total acreage of surface disturbance\naffected by the Reoforce mines was 1.25 acres. DX-195. Thereafter, Reoforce “submitted the\nfirst of what would become several reclamation plan applications to Kern County for review.”\nDX-131.\n\n       43\n          A March 22, 1996 letter from the BLM to Kern County “regarding Mr. Simonson’s\noperations in Red Rock State Park” also made no mention that the Reoforce POO was\nsuspended. DX-151.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f        The January 29, 1998 notes of the Reoforce Board reflect that “Bill Wahl . . . told [Mr.]\nFoggan that the BLM is satisfied with the mining plan and has allowed mining to begin at any\ntime.” DX-191. In April 1998, Mr. Wahl submitted a SMARA application to Kern County on\nbehalf of “the Foggan Group.” DX-143 (SMARA application); DX-145 (letter transmitting\nSMARA application on April 29, 1998). The Foggan Group submitted a SMARA application\nstating the proposed starting date of mining operations as late 1999. DX-144. Mr. Klise and Mr.\nWahl also submitted a new POO to BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office on behalf of the Foggan\nGroup. JX-041. The proposed plan anticipated underground bulk sampling and testing of\n“Reoforce pumicite.” JX-041.\n\n       On April 15, 1998, Riverfront Corporation (“Riverfront”) sent a letter to John Foggan\nexplaining that it was “very interested in the possibility of purchasing your company’s pumicite\nclaims, [and] would like an opportunity to review” information pertaining to the status and\ndevelopment of the mining claims. PX-161. Mr. Simonson was bcc’d on the letter. PX-161;\n9/16/13 TR 260 (Simonson). Riverfront, however, never made a formal offer to purchase\nReoforce’s mining claims. 9/16/13 TR 260 (Simonson).\n\n        On July 2, 1998, Kern County informed the Foggan Group that its POO was not\nadequate, because certain “items were either not included or not sufficiently addressed.” DX-\n142. Thereafter, neither the Foggan Group nor Mr. Wahl took any action to cure these\ndeficiencies. JX-043.\n\n        In August 1998, J.M. Huber Corporation expressed preliminary interest in Reoforce\npumicite, indicating that it “could conceivably fill a profitable niche in Huber’s family of\nfunctional fillers and extenders.” PX-33. After conducting testing and analysis on December 8,\n1988, J.M. Huber informed Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite” was not “functionally\ncompetitive with the control material [they] studied in [a] series of tests, . . . showed no\nadvantage in hiding power (opacity) or scrub resistance over [other] natural ground silica,” and\ncreated a “noticeably darker paint.” DX 207. J.M. Huber advised, however, that further\ndevelopment of “Reoforce pumicite” would make sense, if it could be priced competitively, i.e.,\nin the range of 5–10 cents per pound. DX-207. 44\n\n       There is no evidence in the record of any activity on the Reoforce mining claims from\n1999 through 2000.\n\n       On January 8, 2001, Mr. Simonson wrote a letter to the BLM requesting an extension of\nReoforce’s POO. JX-46. Therein, Mr. Simonson stated that he intended “to begin mining and to\nbring [“Reoforce pumicite”] . . . to the long waited markets” and thanked the BLM for its\npatience regarding the Reoforce mining claims. JX-46 (emphasis added).\n\n\n       44\n          Mr. Simonson testified several years later that J.M. Huber displayed a renewed interest\nin purchasing Reoforce. 9/16/13 TR 277–79 (Simonson). But, according to Mr. Simonson,\nbecause J.M. Huber wanted to purchase “Reoforce pumicite” to keep it off the market to prevent\nit from competing with the precipitated silica they currently sold, he refused the offer. 9/16/13\nTR 280 (Simonson).\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f        On January 17, 2001, the BLM determined, based on a recent inspection of the Reoforce\nmining claims, “there has been no changes and no work performed [t]here for greater than two\nyears.” DX-27. Therefore, the BLM found that the Reoforce mine site was in “non-operation,”\nbut not in compliance with 43 C.F.R. § 3715.3-1(b), and instructed Mr. Simonson to remove “all\nproperty and reclaim” the Reoforce site within ninety days. DX-27. The BLM also informed\nMr. Simonson that, if he disagreed, he could respond in writing within 30 days to Kern County\ndemonstrating that he was in compliance with all state-level environmental and reclamation\nrequirements. DX-27.\n\n        On February 22, 2001, the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office followed up with Mr.\nSimonson, explaining that the Reoforce claims were in non-operation, “simply because [the\nBLM] could see no observable development on the claim[s] since approximately 1995.” DX-30.\nThe BLM also asked Mr. Simonson to verify whether that observation was correct, and if not, to\ndescribe the mining operations conducted since 1995, as the agency “had no wish to shut down a\nproductive mining operation,” but “if [Mr. Simonson’s] equipment is not actually being used,\nthen there is no reason to keep it on public lands.” DX-30. 45\n\n        On September 6, 2002, Mr. Simonson again became President of Reoforce, Inc. after\nother stockholders withdrew their investments and began marketing Reoforce pumicite. 9/16/13\nTR 258 (Simonson); DX-176 (Sept. 8, 2002 Agreement between Reoforce and Mr. Simonson).\nOn November 3, 2002, Mr. Simonson wrote a letter to the California Department of Parks and\nRecreation stating that he obtained an approved POO and that the BLM’s 1989\nuncommon/common variety determination had “given [him] the right to mine” the Reoforce\nclaims. DX-137. After filing several incomplete or deficient applications for approval of a\nreclamation plan that Kern County rejected, Reoforce successfully completed an application in\n“late 2002.” DX-131.\n\n       On December 16, 2002, BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office forwarded the Kern County\nPlanning Department comments about Reoforce’s reclamation plan, explaining that the BLM’s\n1989 approval was contingent on Reoforce complying with Stipulations 5, 9, and 10 in the 1989\napproval. JX-51. In addition, when Reoforce amended its plan,\n\n         [f]ederal regulations will require BLM’s approval of these amendments per 43\n         CFR 3809. A corollary to that approval is BLM’s obligation to perform a validity\n         examination of the mining claim per 43 CFR 3809.100.\nJX-51.\n\n       On February 20, 2003, Mr. Simonson asked the FDA whether “Reoforce pumicite” could\nbe “use[d] as an anticaking agent in food salts.” PX-216. On March 24, 2003, the FDA\nresponded that it did not have any “toxicological concerns” regarding the level of potassium\noxide in “Reoforce pumicite,” if it was used an anticaking agent at a “use level of 1.7%.” PX-\n         45\n           On January 10, 2001, Mr. Wahl also informed the BLM that he was no longer\ninterested in the joint venture, because Mr. Simonson “seems to be acting on his own, outside the\ninterests of Foggan’s Group. . . . [and because Mr. Simonson] wants to build a multi-million\ndollar mill and start mining with little thought for product research and market analysis.” JX-47.\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f216. But, the FDA advised that because of atypically high levels of lead and arsenic in\n“Reoforce pumicite,” the FDA did “not consider your material to be food grade” for use as an\nanticaking agent. PX-216.\n\n       On April 21, 2003 Reoforce filed a SMARA application that proposed to commence\nmining, as soon as Kern County approved Reoforce’s reclamation plan. DX-132. 46\n\n        In May 2003, Reoforce’s 1987 reclamation plan was revised to reflect comments\nreceived from Kern County, the BLM, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation.\nDX-131. For example, the California Department of Parks and Recreation stated that, based on\nthe information Reoforce provided, it was “somewhat difficult to envision that an annual\nproduction level of 50,000, let alone 250,000 tons . . . could be feasibly mined per annum by six\nemployees, hauling through a single specified portal against gravity,” and further stated that it\nwas “difficult to comprehend” this level of commercial mining taking place on the existing\nmining platform Reoforce excavated. DX-131. Therefore, Kern County required Reoforce to\npost a $7,432.07 bond to reclaim the 1.85 acres of disturbed by the Reoforce claims. DX-131.\n\n       On July 24, 2003, the Kern County Planning Commission approved a conditional use\npermit of Reoforce’s “reclamation plan for aboveground surface disturbance.” DX-131.\n\n         On July 26, 2003, Mr. Simonson wrote to the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office and\nrequested a validity exam of Reoforce’s mining claims. DX-37 (“If your office is going to\ninitiate a determination on my valid existing rights, it would be imperative that you start your\nexamination as soon as possible, for I am ready to commence my approved mining operation”).\nMr. Simonson explained that the delay in receiving approval from Kern County “hindered the\nmining of this pumicite.” DX-37.\n\n       On August 12, 2003, the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office sent a letter to Mr. Simonson’s\ncounsel stating:\n\n       The Foggan Group Organization once desired to move a large bulk sample of\n       pumicite from the El Paso Mining Claims, presumably to evaluate its\n       marketability. They submitted a separate and independent proposal for this. The\n       BLM treated this proposal in accordance with the [MOU] signed in 1995\n       (enclosed). That is, that no disturbance can be approved until the validity of these\n       claims is determined.\n\nPX-232 (emphasis added); DX-108 (same); DX-49 (same); DX-54 (describing the Foggan\nGroup’s separate proposal for bulk sampling as being “placed in suspense until completion of a\n\n       46\n           Although the Reoforce mining claims are located on BLM-managed federal lands,\nCalifornia also retains some regulatory control over those lands. For example, the Kern County\nPlanning Department and Kern County Planning Commission had authority to ensure\ncompliance with SMARA. DX-131 (“Approval of a reclamation plan and its content as\nidentified by SMARA and the State Mining and Geology Board guidelines are the extent of Kern\nCounty’s responsibilities[.]”).\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fvalidity examination for the affected mining claims”); DX-78 (1998 statement by BLM that\n“mining cannot begin [until a] validity exam [was] done”). 47\n\n      On September 29, 2003, Mr. Simonson sent a letter to the Secretary of Interior,\ncomplaining that Reoforce had been “hindered over the years by the Ridgecrest BLM office[.]”\nPX-430.\n\n        On October 14, 2003, the BLM requested preliminary information from Mr. Simonson as\nto Reoforce’s corporate status in order to begin the validity examination process. DX-40 (“Your\ndesire to press forward with a validity exam is suitable and appropriate. The BLM concurs that\nan examination of the validity of these claims is necessary. Documenting Reoforce’s corporate\nstatus is a necessary step in that process.”).\n\n       On November 2003, Kern County approved Reoforce’s SMARA reclamation bond. DX-\n39.\n\n        On November 18, 2003, Mr. Simonson submitted a Reoforce 2002 Mining Operation\nAnnual Report to the BLM stating that the status of the Reoforce mines was “Active” and that\nthe total disturbed acreage of the mines was 1.85 acres. DX-166.\n\n       On February 17, 2004, the Supervisory Geologist at the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office\nsent an email to another BLM official, James Hamilton, to explain the agency’s “procedural\npolicy” as to prioritization of validity exams for mining claims located in the Withdrawal Area:\n\n       The BLM determined that if a site was active; i.e., on-going mining and milling\n       were taking place on the date the CDPA was passed, we would allow them to\n       continue operating in the same manner until we completed a validity exam of the\n       operation at some future date. Any non-active operation, such as Mr. Simonson’s,\n       would require completing a validity exam before operations were allowed to\n       proceed.\nPX-438.\n\n        In a March 9, 2004 letter to the BLM, Mr. Simonson requested an explanation as to when\nthe validity determination would be made and complained that “[a]s of October 3, 2003, there\nhas been no communication from you regarding the validity exam that you are in charge of for\nmy Reoforce Inc. Mining Claims.” PX-244. On May 26, 2004, Mr. Simonson wrote a follow-up\nto the BLM, because he received no response to his March 9, 2004 letter. PX-247.\n\n\n       47\n          PX-253 (describing a “letter dated August 12, 2003 [reflecting Mr. Simonson’s view]\nthat my approved mining plan by the BLM is presently not valid until the validity exam is\ncompleted”); PX-291 (referencing the August 12, 2003 letter and stating that there “could be no\ndevelopment [at the Reoforce claims] since 1995[,] because I was told in writing I could not\ndisturb any of the property[,] until the validity exam was completed”); DX-108 (referencing the\nAugust 12, 2003 letter and expressing confusion about recent BLM statements that “almost\nimpl[y] I could have continued to mine on my own plan of operation”).\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\f         In a June 7, 2004 letter to the BLM Ridgecrest Office, Mr. Simonson again complained\nthat “[d]ue to the establishing of the Red Rock Canyon Park, my mining claims were put in\njeopardy until a validity examination could be done” and stated that Reoforce was unable to\nfulfill the 1995 purchase orders from A. Schulman because of the August 1995 MOU. PX-248.\n\n        On September 14, 2004, the BLM State Director advised Mr. Simonson that there was no\n“[POO] for the mining claims owned by Reoforce, Inc.,” because Mr. Simonson allowed the\noriginal El Paso mining claims to lapse by failing to pay the requisite statutory fee. PX-334.\nTherefore, Reoforce’s POO “expired by its own terms in 2002.” PX-334.\n\n        On February 22, 2005, Mr. Simonson sent National Gypsum Company a sample of\n“Reoforce pumicite” and a “sedigraph readout for mineral distribution.” PX-264. On May 10,\n2005, Cargill Salt (“Cargill”) sent Mr. Simonson a letter regarding the potential use of “Reoforce\npumicite” as an anticaking or flow agent for salt. PX-271. At that time, Cargill was purchasing\nprecipitated silica from JM Huber to act as a flow agent for salt. 9/16/13 TR 368–69\n(Simonson). The May 10, 2005 letter indicated that Cargill’s preliminary tests showed that\n“Reoforce pumicite” “prevent[ed] caking and enhance[d] flow,” so that the company was\n“prepared to enter the next phase of testing to ensure that [‘Reoforce pumicite’] functions,” and\nthis would entail “analytical testing, additional stability testing, and inspection of [the Reoforce]\nproduction facility.” PX-271. But, Cargill cautioned that FDA approval likely would be\nrequired, since the pumicite would come into contact with food. PX-271.\n\n       On March 1, 2006, Mr. Simonson sent a letter to the BLM asking when the agency would\ncomplete a validity exam of the Reoforce mining claims. PX-291. The letter explained there\nwas no activity on the Reoforce mining claims in or around August 1995, because Mr. Simonson\n“was told in writing [by the BLM that he] could not disturb any of the property until the validity\nexam was completed.” PX-291.\n\n        On March 2, 2006, a BLM geologist in the California Desert District Office sent an email\nto the official in charge of the California division of the BLM in Sacramento to explain that\n\n       [the BLM geologist] would question any lack of activity on the [Reoforce] mining\n       claim[s being] used as a basis for closing [the Reoforce] case, especially since a\n       latch exists because BLM did not allow the operator to occupy the property until a\n       [validity examination] was complete.\nPX-334. 54\n\n\n       54\n           An undated memorandum that appears to have been written in 2006, from the BLM\nCalifornia State Director to the Assistant Director, Minerals, Realty and Resource Protection\nexplained that the BLM “determined that Mr. Simonson’s situation best fit Group Two [of the\nMOU],” as there was “no on-going or continuous mining activities and no producing mine” on\nReoforce’s claims. PX-353. It also reported that “BLM informed Mr. Simonson that before\nmining could commence we would first have to determine if he had established any valid\nexisting rights, and the way to do that would be by completing a validity examination of his\nmining claims.” PX-353.\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f       E.      On March 15, 2006, The Bureau of Land Management Instituted A Contest\n               Proceeding To Determine The Validity Of Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining\n               Claims.\n\n        On March 15, 2006, a Supervisory Geologist at BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office sent an\nemail to other BLM employees, explaining that “BLM never rescinded Mr. Simonson’s 1987\nplan of operation” and clarified that, in July of 1995, the BLM “identif[ied to Mr. Simonson] the\nneed to conduct a validity exam of his unpatented mining claims before he could initiate\noperations.” PX-334 (emphasis added).\n        On May 2, 2006, the California Department of Parks and Recreation requested the\nBLM’s advice after “receiv[ing] a letter from Mr. Simonson . . . of his on-going Validity Exam\nand his dilemma to show physical discovery of material.” PX-334. On May 3, 2006, the\nSupervisory Geologist at BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office replied that, because the BLM’s\nvalidity exam of Reoforce’s claims was ongoing, Mr. Simonson’s request to conduct exploratory\ndrilling appeared to be an “attempt to accomplish discovery after the fact,” since the purpose of\nthe validity exam was to determine whether Reoforce made a discovery of a valuable mineral\nprior to the date the lands within the Withdrawal Area were segregated. PX-334.\n\n       Mr. Simonson is well aware that we cannot and will not permit him to conduct\n       any further work at these claims until the Validity Exam is completed. The result\n       of the Validity Exam will either be an approval for him to go to work, or a\n       Contest action declaring the claims not valid. That decision is totally dependent\n       upon the data gathered during the [2004] field examination of his unpatented\n       mining claims and what exposure of minerals had been made by the date of the\n       field examination.\n\nPX-334 (emphasis added).\n\n       On September 7, 2006, the BLM issued another Mineral Report (“2006 Mineral Report”)\nrecommending that contest proceedings at the Department of the Interior be initiated, because\n“[n]o discovery of a valuable mineral had been made within the limits of [Mr. Simonson’s\nunpatented mining claims].” JX-69. The 2006 Mineral Report also concluded that pumicite was\nexposed on only two of Plaintiffs’ 23 mining claims, there was no open exposure was present on\nthe other 21 claims, and no market for the exposed “Reoforce pumicite.” JX-69. In short, Mr.\nSimonson did not make a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit recognized by the General\nMining Law. JX-69. Consequently, “Reoforce’s activity falls within Group Two [of the August\n1995 MOU].” JX-69.\n\n       F.      The Contest Proceeding And May 12, 2008 Settlement Agreement.\n\n        On February 8, 2007, the BLM initiated a contest proceeding at the Department of\nInterior alleging that Mr. Simonson’s unpatented mining claims were invalid, because: (1) “[n]o\ndiscovery of a valuable mineral has been made within the limits of [El Paso 1A through El Paso\n23A] . . . the pumicite [located therein] was not actually or prospectively marketable from May\n18, 1995, the date of initial segregation through present;” (2) minerals had not been “found or\nexposed” within the limits of twenty-one of Plaintiffs’ unpatented mining claims in “sufficient\nquantities and/or qualities to constitute a valid discovery of a valuable mineral deposit from May\n\n\n                                               32\n\f18, 1995;” and (3) the pumicite located within the limits of El Paso 6A and El Paso 22A was “a\ncommon variety mineral, and not a valuable mineral deposit.” JSF ¶ 24.\n\n      On October 22–26, 2007, November 26–30, 2007, and March 3–5, 2008, the BLM\nconducted hearings to determine the validity of the Reoforce claims. PX-444.\n\n         On May 12, 2008, the BLM and Reoforce entered into a settlement agreement that\nresolved the contest proceeding, required Reoforce to relinquish all rights, title, and interest in\ntwenty (El Paso claims 1A–5A, 8A–21A, and 23A) of the twenty-three challenged unpatented\nmining claims, but allowed Reoforce to proceed under the 1987 plan of operations to mine on El\nPaso 6A, 7A, and 22A, subject to four stipulations (the “Settlement Agreement”). PX-439. Two\nof those stipulations provided that Reoforce would relinquish all rights, title, and interest in the\nremaining three El Paso mining claims, if Reoforce: (1) failed to begin mining within 24 months\nof execution of the 2008 Settlement Agreement; or (2) ceased mining operations for a continuous\nperiod of twelve months. PX-439. A third stipulation provided that Reoforce had the right to\nmine the El Paso claims for an initial term of 20 years from the date of execution of the 2008\nSettlement Agreement, with an option to renew for an additional 20-year period, provided there\nwas “substantial and continuous mining operations during the first 20 years of operation.” PX-\n439. The fourth stipulation provided that the three mining claims were to be treated as a single\nunit for purposes of the third stipulation, so that mining on any individual claim was sufficient to\nsatisfy the “substantial and continuous mining” requirement of the third stipulation. PX-439. On\nMay 19, 2008, the Department of Interior’s Office of Hearings and Appeals dismissed the\ncontest proceedings. JSF ¶ 25.\n\n       G.      Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Mining Claims After The May 12, 2008\n               Settlement Agreement.\n\n        On July 10, 2008, Reoforce requested that the BLM approve a Road Use POO for a road\nadjacent to the mining claims to haul pumicite at a rate of 50,000 tons per-year (approximately\n200 tons per-day). PX-327. The Road Use Plan was required to comply with the 1987 Reoforce\nplan of operations. JX-7 (May 28, 1987 letter approving Reoforce’s POO, subject to submitting\na comprehensive road plan).\n         On October 28, 2008, the BLM approved the Road Use POO, explaining that “Reoforce\nis free to move forward with [mining operations],” provided it complied with pertinent statutory\nand regulatory requirements, as well as other stipulations previously-imposed by the BLM. PX-\n330.\n\nIII.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY.\n\n       On December 19, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims alleging that the BLM effected a temporary regulatory taking of the three unpatented\nplacer mining claims recognized as valid property rights in the May 12, 2008 Settlement\nAgreement (“Compl.”).\n       On February 17, 2012, the Government filed a Motion To Dismiss, arguing that the court\ndid not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the December 9, 2011 Complaint,\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fbecause it was filed outside the six-year time period required by 28 U.S.C. § 2501. On March\n19, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Response. On April 5, 2012, the Government filed a Reply.\n        On April 25, 2012, then-presiding Senior Judge Futey denied the Government’s February\n17, 2012 Motion To Dismiss. See Reoforce v. United States, No. 11-884, 2012 WL 1427387, *3\n(Fed. Cl. Apr. 25, 2012) (“Reoforce I”) (reasoning that, “[i]f [P]laintiffs had filed a claim in\n1995, then they would have been required to demonstrate the existence of a compensable\nproperty interest, but this existence was not resolved until the validity determination in 2006.”).\nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ claims were not ripe in 1995 and likely would have been dismissed. The\ncourt also determined that Plaintiffs’ claims did not accrue in 1995, “because the [MOU] . . . was\nnot a final governmental determination depriving [Plaintiffs] of a compensable property right.”\nId. at *3 (quoting Navajo Nation v. United States, 631 F.3d 1268, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“In\ncertain situations, a claim for a temporary regulatory taking does not accrue when a regulation is\nenacted[,] because the regulation itself is not a final governmental determination depriving a\nplaintiff of a compensable property right.”)). Therefore, the court determined that Plaintiffs’\nclaims in this case accrued on September 7, 2006, when the BLM issued the 2006 Mineral\nReport, finding that Plaintiffs never made a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit within the\nsix-year statute of limitations. Id. at *5.\n\n       On May 9, 2012, the Government filed an Answer, asserting six affirmative defenses. 56\n\n        On July 23, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment arguing that,\nas a matter of law, the duration of the Government’s alleged temporary regulatory taking was\nfrom August 7, 1995 to May 12, 2008. On July 30, 2012, the Government also filed a Motion\nFor Partial Summary Judgment, contending that Plaintiffs could pursue a temporary regulatory\ntakings claim only for the period September 7, 2006, i.e., the date that Senior Judge Futey\ndetermined that Plaintiffs’ claims accrued, to May 12, 2008, i.e., when the Settlement Agreement\nwas entered. On August 31, 2012, both parties filed a Response. On September 21, 2012, both\nparties filed a Reply.\n\n        On December 11, 2012, Senior Judge Futey denied both Partial Motions For Summary\nJudgment, determining that Plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because a\nplaintiff can only recover damages from the date commencing when the Government’s taking\nbegins. See Order, Reoforce v. United States, ECF No. 11-884, Dkt. 27 at 6–8 (Fed. Cl. Dec. 11,\n2012) (“Reoforce II”). The Government’s Motion For Partial Summary Judgment also was\ndenied, because issues of material fact remained as to “whether plaintiffs can establish a taking\nby extraordinary delay, and if so, the date such delay became extraordinary, prior to September\n7, 2006.” Reoforce II, at 10. In so ruling, Senior Judge Futey determined that the valid existing\nrights determination was the functional equivalent of a permitting process. Id. at 6–10.\n\n       56\n          Those affirmative defenses were: (1) the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted; (2) that the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate “in whole or in part the\nsubject matter of this action;” (3) the claims alleged are barred by the applicable statute of\nlimitations; (4) the Complaint fails to allege an action undertaken by the Government that was\nripe for adjudication; (5) Plaintiffs’ lacked standing; and (6) Plaintiffs’ lacked a “compensable\nproperty interest to pursue this claim.” Answer at 5.\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\f        On November 14, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment On\nUnited States’ Sixth Affirmative Defense, arguing that the doctrines of equitable estoppel and res\njudicata precluded the Government from arguing that Plaintiffs’ lacked a compensable property\ninterest in the three unpatented mining claims. On December 17, 2012, the Government filed a\nResponse. On January 14, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Reply. On April 4, 2013, Senior Judge Futey\ngranted Plaintiffs’ November 14, 2012 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment regarding the\nGovernment’s sixth affirmative defense. See Reoforce v. United States, 2013 WL 1405925 (Apr.\n4, 2013) (“Reoforce III”). Therein, the court determined that the May 12, 2008 Settlement\nAgreement was a final judgment on the merits, because the parties fully and fairly litigated\nwhether Plaintiffs had made a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit in the contest proceedings,\nand Plaintiffs “emerged with rights to mine under a valid settlement agreement, . . . [so that] res\njudicata prevents the Government from asserting [that Plaintiffs lack] a compensable property\ninterest” as to the three unpatented mining claims at issue. Reoforce III, 2013 WL 1405925 at\n*7; see also id. at *8 (“Plaintiffs’ property interest in the unpatented mining claims has been\nestablished as a matter of law.”).\n\n        On January 8, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Reconsideration because of an\nintervening change in the law occasioned by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\nArkansas Game and Fish Commission v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 511 (2012). Therein,\nPlaintiffs contend that Senior Judge Futey erroneously construed the December 19, 2011\nComplaint as solely asserting a temporary regulatory taking claim stemming from the BLM’s\nalleged extraordinary delay in the valid existing rights determination process and equating the\ncontest proceedings to a permitting scheme. On January 25, 2013, the Government filed a\nResponse, agreeing with Plaintiffs that the contest proceedings were not analogous to a\npermitting process, but that the “concessions in [the] Motion [F]or Reconsideration require that\n[Plaintiffs] claim be dismissed as time barred.” Dkt. 35 at 2. On February 7, 2013, Senior Judge\nFutey granted Plaintiffs’ January 8, 2013 Motion For Reconsideration and determined that the\nGovernment’s alleged taking may have occurred before Plaintiffs’ claims accrued, so that\ncompensation should be measured from the time of the Government’s initial interference with\nPlaintiffs’ property rights, instead of when the claims accrued. See Order, Reoforce v. United\nStates, No. 11-884, Dkt. 37 at 2 (Fed. Cl. Feb. 7, 2013) (“Reoforce IV”) In addition, although\nPlaintiffs’ claims may not have accrued until the contest proceedings were complete, “the\ninterference that effects a taking might begin much earlier, and compensation is measured from\nthat time.” Id. (quoting First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. L.A. Cnty.,\n482 U.S. 304, 321 (1987)). Therefore, Senior Judge Futey determined that Plaintiffs “may use\nthe issuance of the mineral report date [on September 7, 2006] to determine that the procedural\ntime limit [of the statute of limitations] is met, and the date of the MOU’s issuance [on August 7,\n1995] to evaluate whether a taking occurred.” Id. at 2–3.\n\n       On May 24, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion To Amend Complaint To Add A Plaintiff,\nRonald Stehn, that the court granted on June 18, 2013. That same day, Plaintiffs filed an\nAmended Complaint that is substantively identical to the December 9, 2011 Complaint, other\nthan the addition of a new plaintiff Complaint (“Am. Compl.”). Compare Compl. ¶ 2, with Am.\nCompl. ¶ 2. On June 26, the Government filed an Answer to the June 18, 2013 Amended\nComplaint, reasserting the same six affirmative defenses, as were pled on May 9, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\f       On June 20, 2013, then-Chief Judge Hewitt transferred this case to the undersigned judge,\npursuant to RCFC 40.1(c).\n\n        On August 14, 2013, the Government filed an Unopposed Motion To Admit Prior\nTestimony Of Joseph L. Gum, Supervisory Geologist at the BLM Ridgecrest Field Office and\nPlaintiffs filed an Unopposed Motion To Admit Deposition Testimony From Ronald Stehn. On\nAugust 15, 2013, the court granted both motions.\n\n        On August 20, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion In Limine, requesting that the court rule\nthat certain exhibits were admissible prior to trial. On August 30, 2014, the Government filed a\nResponse. On September 10, 2013, the court denied Plaintiffs’ August 20, 2013 Motion without\nprejudice.\n\n      A trial was held in this case from September 16–23, 2013 as to liability and damages\n(“TR 1−1360”).\n\n       On October 30, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion To Admit Seven Additional Exhibits. On\nNovember 6, 2013, the Government filed a Response. On November 13, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a\nReply. On November 14, 2013, the court admitted the documents Plaintiffs requested but\ndeferred ruling on admissibility of the evidence until issuance of the court’s Memorandum\nOpinion and Final Order.\n\n        On November 27, 2013, Plaintiffs filed an Opening Post-Trial Brief (“Pl. Br.”). On\nJanuary 22, 2014, the Government filed a Post-Trial Brief (“Gov’t Br.”). On February 12, 2014,\nPlaintiffs filed a Post-Trial Reply (“Pl. Reply”). On February 25, 2014, the court issued an Order\ngranting the Government leave to file a Surreply. On March 7, 2014, the Government filed a\nSurreply (“Gov’t Reply”).\n\n       On June 9, 2014, at the court’s request, the parties filed a Joint Exhibit List with an\nitemization of all exhibits proffered at trial, and reasserting the parties’ respective objections to\nthose exhibits.\n\nIV.    DISCUSSION.\n\n       A.      Whether 28 U.S.C. § 2501 Bars Plaintiffs’ Takings Claims.\n\n         The Government requested that the court reconsider Senior Judge Futey’s prior ruling\nthat Plaintiffs’ claims accrued on September 7, 2006, when the BLM issued a second Mineral\nReport, because a claim “first accrues when all the events have occurred that fix the alleged\nliability of the [G]overnment and entitle the claimant to institute an action.” Gov’t Br. 40\n(quoting Ingrum v. United States, 560 F.3d 1311, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). Plaintiffs respond that\n“[r]econsideration is not proper if arguments previously made are simply reasserted.” Pl. Reply\n21 n.13; see also Fru-Con Constr. Corp. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 298, 301 (1999)\n(explaining that reconsideration is warranted where the moving party shows “(1) that an\nintervening change in the controlling law has occurred; (2) that previously unavailable evidence\nis now available; or (3) that the motion is necessary to prevent manifest injustice”). Since the\nGovernment “does not contend that any of these standards apply and they do not,” the court\nshould deny reconsideration of the statute of limitations issue. Pl. Reply 21 n.13.\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f         As a matter of law, the statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2501 is\n“jurisdictional,” requiring “a court to decide a timeliness question despite a waiver,\n[and] . . . forbidding a court to consider whether certain equitable considerations warrant\nextending a limitations period.” John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130,\n133–34 (2008); see also Holmes v. United States, 657 F.3d 1303, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2011)\n(“Compliance with the statute of limitations [contained in Section 2501] is a jurisdictional\nrequirement.”). Moreover, a federal trial court always has an independent obligation to ascertain\nsubject matter jurisdiction at any point in the proceedings, whether raised by a party or not. See\nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004) (“A litigant generally may raise a court’s lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action[.]”); see also Folden v. United\nStates, 379 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“Subject-matter jurisdiction may be challenged at\nany time by the parties or by the court sua sponte.”). Therefore, the court has decided to\nreconsider whether Section 2501 bars Plaintiffs’ regulatory taking claim. See RCFC 12(h)(3)\n(“If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must\ndismiss the action.”).\n\n        As for the merits, determining when a taking accrues requires answering two related\nquestions. First, have all events that fix the alleged liability of the Government occurred? See\nHopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, 855 F.2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1988)\n(Generally, a takings “claim ‘first accrues’ when all the events have occurred which fix the\nalleged liability of the [Government] and entitle the plaintiff to institute an action.”) . Second, is\nthe claim ripe? See Williamson Cnty. Reg’l Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Jefferson\nCity, 473 U.S. 172, 191 (1985) (holding that a regulatory taking is ripe when “the administrative\nagency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at\nissue to the particular land in question”); see also Bayou Des Familles Dev. Corp. v. United\nStates, 130 F.3d 1034, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (same). In this case, the answer to both of these\nquestions is yes.\n\n        Typically, accrual and ripeness of an alleged takings claims are analyzed simultaneously.\nSee Navajo Nation v. United States, 631 F.3d 1268, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2011). In this case, the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU was the first step of an administrative process to transfer federal land to\nthe State. And, the BLM was clear that a validity determination would need to be conducted for\nall affected property before any transfer. JX-34 (MOU). Therefore, for a compensable property\nright to accrue on August 7, 1995, the BLM would have needed to commence and complete a\nvalidity determination on that date. See Navajo Nation, 631 F.3d at 1278 (recognizing that a\ntakings claim does not accrue unless “the regulation itself is . . . a final governmental\ndetermination depriving a plaintiff of a compensable property right); see also Vane Minerals\n(US), LLC v. United States, 116 Fed. Cl. 48, 63 (2014) (“Plaintiff failed to obtain a [validity]\ndetermination and consequently has no property right.”). Therefore, Plaintiffs’ takings claim did\nnot accrue until the validity determination was made, i.e. on May 12, 2008 when the Settlement\nAgreement issued and fixed liability. PX-439 (“This Agreement . . . fully resolves Mineral\nContest CACA 48717.”). Likewise, Plaintiffs’ takings claim was not ripe until May 12, 2008,\nbecause that was the final date of BLM action. See Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 618\n(2001) (“[A] takings claim challenging the application of land-use regulations is not ripe unless\nthe government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final\ndetermination regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.”) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Goodrich v. United States, 434 F.3d 1329, 1334–35\n\n\n                                                 37\n\f(Fed. Cir. 2006) (explaining that a takings claim was not ripe until the Government issued a final\ndirective restricting a landowner’s property rights).\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that Plaintiffs’ takings claim both accrued and\nbecame ripe on May 12, 2008. Therefore, 28 U.S.C. § 2501 does not bar the court from\nadjudicating the takings claim alleged in the December 19, 2011 Complaint.\n\n       B.      Whether Plaintiffs Have Standing.\n\n         Article III standing is also a jurisdictional prerequisite that the court must ascertain, even\nif not raised by the parties. See Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 474 F.3d 1281, 1289\n(Fed. Cir. 2007) (“Because Article III standing is jurisdictional, this court must consider the issue\nsua sponte[.]”). The United States Supreme Court has instructed that the plaintiff has the burden\nto establish three elements before a federal trial court may adjudicate an alleged takings claim.\nFirst, “‘injury in fact,’ by which we mean an invasion of a legally protected interest that is\n‘(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical[.]’”\nNe. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,\n663 (1993) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). Second, “a\ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct[.]” Id. Third, “a likelihood\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision, by which we mean that the ‘prospect of\nobtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling’ is not ‘too speculative.’” Id.\n(quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984)). “These elements are the ‘irreducible\nminimum’ required by the Constitution.” Id. (quoting Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans\nUnited for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982)).\n\n        In this case, the “injury in fact” element is particularly problematic. See Ne. Fla.\nChapter, 508 U.S. at 663 (holding that injury in fact requires “an invasion of a legally protected\ninterest”) (emphasis added); see also Wyatt v. United States, 271 F.3d 1090, 1096 (Fed. Cir.\n2001) (holding that the trial court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings claim unless\nthe plaintiff has a “valid property interest at the time of the taking”) (emphasis added). The court\nis aware that unpatented mining claims are recognized as a protected property interest, but only\n“if there has been a discovery of mineral within the limits of the claim[.]” Best v. Humboldt\nPlacer Min. Co., 371 U.S. 334, 336 (1963) (emphasis added). The 1989 BLM Mineral Report\nconcluded that the “Reoforce pumicite” was an uncommon variety and locatable mineral under\nthe General Mining Law, but emphasized that this finding was “not a mining claim validity\nreport.” PX 42:012; see also Holden v. United States, 38 Fed. Cl. 732, 735 (1997) (“To have a\ncompensable interest in unpatented mining claims sufficient to bring a taking action in [the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims], there must have been a determination as to the validity\nof those mining claims.”) (emphasis in original). Only the BLM may determine validity. See\nCameron v. United States, 252 U.S. 450, 460 (1920) (“[T]he Secretary of the Interior . . . is\ncharged with seeing that . . . valid claims may be recognized, invalid ones eliminated, and the\nrights of the public preserved.”); see also Best¸ 371 U.S. at 336 (same). In this case, the BLM\ndid not make a validity determination until the May 12, 2008 Settlement.\n\n        For this reason, the court has determined that Plaintiffs did not have standing to seek an\nadjudication of a takings claim until May 12, 2008. Plaintiffs, however, did not file suit on that\ndate, but waited until December 19, 2011.\n\n\n                                                  38\n\f        The May 12, 2008 Settlement Agreement between Plaintiffs and the BLM, however,\nspecifically provides:\n\n       Reoforce can proceed under its approved [POO] to mine the El Paso 6A, El Paso\n       7A, and El Paso 22A placer mining claims, subject to the following conditions:\n\n       (a) Reoforce shall begin mining within 24 months of execution of this settlement\n       agreement. If mining does not begin within 24 months, this agreement shall\n       terminate and Reoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title and interest in El\n       Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El Paso 22A unpatented mining claims.\n\n       (b) If Reoforce ceases mining operations for any continuous period of 12 months,\n       this agreement shall terminate and Reoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title\n       and interest in El Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El Paso 22A unpatented mining\n       claims.\n\nPX-439 (emphasis added).\n\n       Neither Mr. Simonson’s trial testimony (TR 32–541) nor any other evidence establishes\nthat Plaintiffs began mining within 24 months, as required by the May 12, 2008 Settlement\nAgreement. Indeed, on October 28, 2008, after the BLM approved Reoforce’s Road Use POO\nthere were no federal or state regulatory impediments to Plaintiffs engaging in mining activities.\nPX 330. But, there is no evidence in the record that any “mining” took place on the El Paso 6A,\nEl Paso 7A, or El Paso 22A claims, either after May 12, 2008 Settlement or after BLM’s October\n28, 2008 approval of Reoforce’s Road Use POO.\n\n        As a matter of law, a plaintiff initially must plead some injury to have standing and the\ncourt must accept those allegations as true when making a standing determination. See\nPennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 7 (1988) (“[W]hen standing is challenged on the basis of\nthe pleadings, we ‘accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and . . . construe the\ncomplaint in favor of the complaining party[.]’”) (citation omitted). But, after trial, a plaintiff’s\nobligation to establish standing is subject to a more stringent standard, particularly where the\ncause of action arises from the United States Constitution. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (holding\nthat the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the requisite elements\nand that “each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the\nplaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the\nsuccessive stages of the litigation”) (emphasis added). To require that a plaintiff have title to\nproperty at the time a suit is filed or forgo the ability to obtain an adjudication of a takings claim\nmay be viewed as harsh. But here, where Plaintiffs voluntarily relinquished all property rights,\nstanding has been compromised. PX-439 (“If mining does not begin within 24 months, . . .\nReoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title, and interest in El Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El\nPaso 22A unpatented mining claims.”).\n\n        Therefore, in the court’s judgment, this case should be dismissed on standing grounds,\nalbeit not suggested by the Government. In any event, as discussed herein, even assuming,\narguendo, that Plaintiffs have standing, the record does not establish that the August 7, 1995\nMOU effected a taking that warrants compensation.\n\n\n\n                                                 39\n\f       C.      Whether The August 7, 1995 Memorandum Of Understanding Between The\n               Bureau Of Land Management And The State Of California Effected A\n               Taking of Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Claims.\n\n        A “takings claim calls for a two-step analysis.” Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. Ammon, 209 F.3d\n1366, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2000). First, the trial court must determine whether the claimant has\nestablished a compensable property interest. See Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, 379\nF.3d 1363, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Second, the trial court must determine whether the character\nof the governmental action affected the claimant’s “bundle of property rights.” Karuk Tribe, 209\nF.3d at 1374; see also Chancellor Manor v. United States, 331 F.3d 891, 902 (Fed. Cir. 2003)\n(discussing whether governmental action “constitutes a compensable taking for a public\npurpose”).\n\n               1.     Whether Plaintiffs Had A Compensable Property Right On August 7,\n                      1995, When The Department Of The Interior Entered Into The\n                      Memorandum Of Understanding With The State Of California.\n\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a plaintiff also\nmust have a “valid property interest at the time of the taking[.]” See Am. Pelagic Fishing, 379\nF.3d at 1372 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs’ property interest did not vest until the May 12, 2008\nSettlement Agreement. Therefore, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs did not have a compensable\nproperty interest for purposes of the Fifth Amendment on August 7, 1995, the date the MOU\nbecame effective. As such, the court’s “task is at an end.” Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., 379 F.3d at\n1372. Nevertheless, the court will complete the two-part analysis established in Karuk Tribe.\n\n               2.     Assuming, Arguendo, That Plaintiffs Had A Compensable Property\n                      Right On August 7, 1995, Whether The Character Of The\n                      Memorandum Of Understanding Effected A Taking.\n\n        Assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs had compensable property right on August 7, 1995,\nthe MOU had no binding legal effect on that date, because validity determinations remained to\nbe conducted on all unpatented mining claims. JX-34; see also Goodrich v. United States, 434\nF.3d 1329, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (explaining that for a taking to occur, the government action\nmust be analogous to “final agency action.”). Of course, Plaintiffs assert that “the BLM’s actual\ntreatment of the Reoforce claims” evidences that the August 7, 1995 MOU did “alter existing\nrights or regulations.” Pl. Reply 4. But, what Plaintiffs thought the legal effect of the August 7,\n1995 MOU was, does not establish a legal obligation.\n\n        There are several dispositive pieces of evidence substantiating that the August 7, 1995\nMOU did not effect or suspend Plaintiff’s May 28, 1987 approved POO. First, the BLM\nspecifically informed Mr. Simonson on July 12, 1995 that “[f]or operations such as yours, you\nwill be allowed to continue in accordance with your approved mining [POO] while the validity\nexam process i[s] completed for your claims.” DX-19 (emphasis added). Second, after the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU, Plaintiffs entered into a joint venture (JX-40); obtained a diesel permit for\noperation (PX-144); drilled exploratory holes on the claims (DX-156); continued to market\n“Reoforce pumicite” (PX-33; PX-161; DX-183); and filed an application to comply with\n\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fSMARA (DX-132). As such, the evidence belies Plaintiffs’ contention that Reoforce was\nprohibited from mining by the MOU as of August 7, 1995.\n\n          For these reasons, the court has determined that the August 7, 1995 MOU did not effect a\ntaking.\n\n          D.     Assuming, Arguendo, That The August 7, 1995 Memorandum Of\n                 Understanding Effected A Taking Of Plaintiffs’ Mining Rights,\n                 Compensation Is Not Warranted.\n\n        Assuming, arguendo, that the August 7, 1995 MOU effected a taking of Plaintiffs’\nmining claims, it is well established that not every government action that reduces a property’s\nvalue is a regulatory taking, but some regulations can be so severe that the Fifth Amendment\nrequires payment of compensation. Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of N.Y., 438 U.S. 104, 136\n(1978) (holding that courts “must consider whether the interference with [Plaintiffs’] property is\nof such a magnitude that there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to\nsustain [it].”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[W]hether a particular restriction\nwill be rendered invalid by the government’s failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by\nit depends largely ‘upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.’” Id. This analysis is ad hoc\nand fact-specific. The United States Supreme Court has identified three factors that a trial court\nmust consider the: (1) “economic impact of the regulation on the claimant”; (2) “extent to which\nthe regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations”; and (3) “character of\nthe governmental action.” Cienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319, 1337 (Fed. Cir.\n2003). The intent of Penn Central is “to ensure that not every restraint imposed by government\nto adjust the competing demands of private owners [will] result in a takings claim.” Id. at 1340\n(quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Not surprisingly, the parties have a different perspective of the economic impact of the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU: the Government asserts that the economic impact at best was $107,000;\nPlaintiffs insist they suffered $46.5 million in economic harm. Compare Gov’t Br. 62 with PX-\n443. The record, however, establishes that despite repeated efforts, Plaintiffs failed to achieve\nmarket acceptance of “Reoforce pumicite” prior to the issuance of the August 7, 1995 MOU.\nDX-12; DX-205; DX-180. In fact, after Plaintiffs obtained the May 28, 1987 POO until the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU was enacted, only two sales of “Reoforce pumicite” were made. 9/17/13\nTR 429–31 (Simonson). At best, Plaintiffs were several years away from commercial-scale\nmining on August 7, 1995. 9/19/13 TR 1130 (Springer) (Reoforce had not completed an\nadequate exploratory drill program in August 1995); 9/19/13 TR 1131 (Springer) (as of August\n1995, Reoforce did not have SMARA approval); 9/19/13 TR 1136 (Springer) (as of August\n1995, Reoforce did not comply with Federal Mine Safety Health Administration’s regulatory\nrequirements); 9/19/13 TR 1139 (Springer) (all of these actions “made it difficult if not\nimpossible for Reoforce to secure the funding or financial partners necessary to develop\ncommercial-scale mining”). Other trial testimony estimated that, on August 7, 1995, Plaintiffs\nstill were at least four to eight years away from commercial viability. 9/20/13 TR 1167\n(Springer). As such, Plaintiffs incurred no economic harm caused by the August 7, 1995 MOU\nor any other BLM action.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\f        As for Plaintiffs’ “investment-backed expectations,” the barriers to entry into a\ncommodity market were substantial and commercial viability “highly speculative.” DX-120, at\n13–17 (Dr. Frahme); 9/20/13 TR 1184–1202 (Dr. Frahme). In addition, the record is replete with\nevidence of Mr. Simonson sending numerous samples of the “Reoforce pumicite” to academic\nand corporate entities to ascertain whether this mineral had any commercial use or market value.\nPX-7, PX-16, PX-26, PX-29, PX-31, PX-32, PX-34, PX-37, PX-38, PX-39, PX-41, PX-42; PX-\n55, PX-56, PX-67, PX-68, PX-70, PX-76, PX-96, PX-103, PX-109, PX-111, PX-128, PX-264,\nPX-271, PX-436, DX-69, DX-74, DX-94. Although there was some indication of potential\ncommercial use, no one advised Plaintiffs that “Reoforce pumicite” was “of such a character that\n‘a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and\nmeans, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.’”\nChrisman v. Miller, 197 U.S. 313, 322 (1905); see also Creppel v. United States, 41 F.3d 627,\n632 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that the investment-backed expectations element “limits recovery\nto owners who can demonstrate that they bought their property in reliance of the nonexistence of\nthe challenged regulation”). As such, Plaintiffs failed to establish that the August 7, 1995 MOU\ninterfered with reasonable “investment-based expectations.”\n\n        Finally, The United States Supreme Court has held that in ascertaining whether\ncompensation is warranted, the courts should determine whether the government action at issue\n“merely affects property interests through ‘some public program adjusting the benefits and\nburdens of economic life to promote the common good.’” Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544\nU.S. 528, 539 (2005) (quoting Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124). In analyzing the nature of the\ngovernment action, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has directed the\ntrial court to focus on both “the purpose of the regulation and its desired effects” and “the\nrelative benefits and burdens associated with the regulatory action.” Bass Enters. Prod.\nCo. v. United States, 381 F.3d 1360, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Rose Acre Farms,\nInc. v. United States, 373 F.3d 1177, 1194 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“[The issue] is whether there is a\nnexus between the regulation and its underlying public purpose.”) (emphasis in original).\n\n        Congress authorized the BLM to manage public land. See 43 U.S.C. § 1701. The\npurpose of the August 7, 1995 MOU was to manage and administer federal land located within\nthe Red Rock Canyon State Park, primarily to insure compliance with federal mining laws and\nNEPA, which benefits the public at large. JX-43 at IIIA(1). Plaintiffs counter that the August 7,\n1995 MOU “was not a nationwide change in mining regulations applicable to everyone. It only\napplied to those few within the proposed addition to the Red Rock Canyon State Park.” Pl. Br.\n38. As such, Plaintiffs contend that they bore the full economic impact of this regulatory\nactivity. But, Plaintiffs provide no authority for the proposition that a regulation issued on a less-\nthan-nationwide basis equates to “targeting.” Without evidence that the BLM went out of its\nway to impose regulations on Plaintiffs alone, without a legitimate reason, the court must assume\nthat the BLM acted in good faith.

THE RELEVANT FEDERAL STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING\n       UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS.\n\n       A.        The 1872 General Mining Law.\n\n       In 1872, Congress enacted 30 U.S.C. §§ 22–54 (“the General Mining Law”) that\nprovides:\n\n       [A]ll valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both\n       surveyed and unsurveyed, shall be free and open to exploration and purchase, and\n       the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the\n       United States . . . under regulations prescribed by law[.]\n\n30 U.S.C. § 22.\n\n         The General Mining Law “made public lands available to people for the purpose of\nmining valuable mineral deposits,” with the aim of “reward[ing] and encourag[ing] the discovery\nof minerals that are valuable in an economic sense.” United States v.

If one discovers valuable mineral deposits, the\nstatute grants him the right to extract and sell the minerals without paying a royalty to the United\nStates, as well as the right—subject to certain statutory requirements—to obtain fee title to the\nland.”).\n\n        To secure rights under the General Mining Law, a claimant first must “locate” a valid\nmining claim on federal lands, physically mark the boundaries of the claim, post a discovery\nmonument and notice, and satisfy other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. See 30\nU.S.C. § 28 (enumerating the requirements for “location” of a mining claim, including distinctly\nmarking the boundaries of the claim and maintaining adequate records concerning the date of\nlocation and boundaries of the claims); see also United States v. Locke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111403\"><a href=\"/opinion/111403/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (1985)\n(“‘Discovery’ of a mineral deposit, followed by the minimal procedures required to formally\n\n\n                                                                     3\n\f‘locate’ the deposit, gives an individual the right of exclusive possession of the land for mining\npurposes[.]”). But the location of a mining claim is only the first step in the process, because “a\nmining claimant acquires no vested rights by location of a mining claim. Even though a claim\nmay be perfected in all other respects, unless and until a claimant is able to show that the claim\nis supported by a discovery of a valuable locatable mineral within the boundaries of the claim,\nno rights are acquired.” United States v. Rocky Conner, 139 IBLA 361, 365 (1997) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n         For mining claims 2 located on areas designated as “Limited Use” or “Class L” lands, the\nBLM requires an operator to submit and obtain approval of a plan of operations “before\nbeginning operations greater than casual use.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(a). 3 This requirement has\nbeen in place since 1980, when the BLM promulgated surface management regulations for\nmining operations, to prevent “unnecessary or undue degradation of federal lands which may\nresult from operations authorized by the mining laws.” NOTICE OF FINAL RULEMAKING, 45 FED.\nREG. 78,902, 78,909 (Nov. 26, 1980); see also id. at 78,911 (promulgating 43 C.F.R. § 3809)\n(“An approved plan of operations is required prior to commencing . . . [a]ny operation, except\ncasual use, in . . . [the] California Desert Conservation Area”); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.1-4 (1983)\n(“An approved plan of operations is required prior to commencing . . . [a]ny operation, except\ncasual use, in . . . [l]ands in the California Desert Conservation Area designated as ‘controlled’\nor ‘limited’ use areas[.]”); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.1-4 (1994) (same); 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(c) (same);\n43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(c)(1) (2014) (same).\n\n        The BLM requires that a plan of operations must include: operator information; a\ndescription of the mining operations to be undertaken; maps; water management plans; and other\ninformation “sufficient for BLM to determine that the plan of operations prevents unnecessary or\nundue degradation.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.401. Once a plan of operations is approved, an operator\nis entitled to begin mining, consistent with the plan and applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. See 43 C.F.R. § 3809.412 (“You must not begin operations until BLM approves\nyour plan of operations[.]”); see also 43 C.F.R. § 3809.415(a) (obligating a mining claimant to\ncomply with “the terms and conditions of your notice or approved plan of operations and other\nFederal and State laws related to environmental protection and protection of cultural resources”);\n43 C.F.R. § 3809.3 (requiring a mining claimant to follow state laws or regulations for\noperations on public lands, unless they conflict with the BLM’s regulations).

See 43 U.S.C. § 1781 (establishing the California Desert\nConservation Area “to provide for the immediate and future protection and administration of\n[those] lands . . . within the framework of a program of multiple use and sustained yield, and the\nmaintenance of environmental quality”). The claims are located on lands designated as “Limited\nUse” or “Class L” lands. JSF ¶ 5 (“The El Paso placer claims and Big Jim Lode claim were and\nare located within the Conservation Area on land that the [BLM] has designated as ‘Limited\nUse’ or ‘Class L’ lands.”).\n       3\n         “Casual use,” is defined as “activities ordinarily resulting in no or negligible disturbance\nof public lands or resources.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.5.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\foperator decides to make changes to the “operations described in [the] approved plan of\noperations,” the operator is requires to submit, and have approved, a modified plan of operations.\nSee 43 C.F.R. § 3809.431; see also id. § 432(a) (explaining that the “BLM will review and\napprove a modification of your plan of operations in the same manner as it reviewed and\napproved your initial plan [of operations]”).\n\n        As a matter of law, the “location” of a mining claim and an approved plan of operations\ndo not convey a compensable property interest to extract and sell minerals.

See Kunkes, 78 F.3d at 1551.\nBut, the Government “maintains broad powers over the terms and conditions upon which the\npublic lands can be used, leased, and acquired,” and it retains significant regulatory authority\nover unpatented mining claims. See Locke, 471 U.S. at 104. For example, a claimant may only\nuse the land encompassing an unpatented mining claim in ways that are “reasonably incident to\nmining,” be required to pay annual maintenance fees, or forfeit the claims for failure to meet\nother certain statutory and regulatory requirements.

The 1955 Common Varieties Act.\n\n        In 1955, Congress enacted the Common Varieties Act, 30 U.S.C. § 611, that withdrew\ncertain “common varieties” of minerals, such as sand, gravel, pumice, and pumicite, from the\nGeneral Mining Law. See 30 U.S.C. § 611 (“No deposit of common varieties of sand, stone,\ngravel, pumice, pumicite, or cinders and no deposit of petrified wood shall be deemed a valuable\nmineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the United States so as to give\neffective validity to any mining claim hereafter located under such mining laws[.]”). Mineral\ndeposits that “ha[ve] some property giving it distinct and special value,” however, are excluded\nfrom the Common Varieties Act, and are subject to private ownership, i.e., they are “locatable,”\nunder the General Mining Law. Id. These types of mineral deposits are referred to as\n“uncommon variety minerals.” Copar Pumice Co. v.

A mineral examination report may confirm a mineral’s status\nas an “uncommon variety.” Id. at 824.\n\n       C.      The California Surface Mining And Reclamation Act of 1975.\n\n        In 1995, California’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (“SMARA”) was\nenacted that requires a mine operator must have an approved plan in place before it may reclaim\nlands surrounding a mine after operations cease, by “ripping all compacted aboveground surface\ndisturbance, followed by the recontouring, stabilization, and approximation of the soil surface\nagainst the long-term effects of erosion.” Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 2710; DX-131; see also\nNelson v. Cnty. of Kern, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Pub. Res.\nCode. § 2770)). A bond and reclamation plan is required only for aboveground mines, but if an\nunderground mine has more than one-acre of total surface area disturbance, SMARA does apply.\nDX-131.\n\n       D.      The 1976 Federal Land Policy And Management Act.\n\n        In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (“FLPMA”) to\nadminister public lands more efficiently and comprehensively by balancing environmental,\neconomic, and federalism concerns. See 43 U.S.C. § 1701(a)(1)–(13) (enumerating the polices\nof FLPMA). Pursuant to Section 204, the Secretary of the Interior (the “Secretary”) is\nauthorized to withdraw certain public lands from location and entry from the General Mining\nLaw. See 43 U.S.C. § 1714(a) (“[T]he Secretary is authorized to make . . . withdrawals[,] but\nonly in accordance with the provisions and limitations of this section.”); see also id. § 1702(j)\n(providing that “‘withdrawal’ means withholding an area of Federal land from settlement, sale,\nlocation, or entry, under some or all of the general land laws”). The Secretary also has authority\nto “segregate[]” lands from the operation of the public lands laws of the United States for a\nlimited period of time, by publishing notice of the segregation in the Federal Register. See 43\nU.S.C. § 1714(b)(1).\n\n        A withdrawal prohibits establishment of new mining claims on public lands but does not\nextinguish claims of the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit that was made prior to the date\nof withdrawal. See Skaw, 13 Cl. Ct. at 28 (“When land is closed to location under the mining\nlaws subsequent to the location of a mining claim, the validity of the claim cannot be recognized\nunless the claim was supported by a valid discovery at the time of the withdrawal.”); see also\nCameron, 252 U.S. at 456 (holding that a mining claim is valid if “there is an adequate mineral\ndiscovery within the limits of the claim” that “preceded the creation of [the] reserve [that\nwithdrew the lands]”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f       E.      The 1976 California Desert Protection Act and the 1994 California Desert\n               Protection Act.\n\n       In 1976, Congress also enacted the California Desert Conservation Protection Act. See\n43 U.S.C. § 1781(d) (directing the Secretary to “prepare and implement a comprehensive, long-\nrange plan for the management, use, development, and protection of the public lands within the\nCalifornia Desert Conservation Area”). On October 31, 1994, the California Desert Protection\nAct (“CDPA”) was enacted that directed the Secretary to transfer certain lands within the\nCalifornia Desert Protection Area to the State for inclusion in Red Rock Canyon State Park. See\n16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-71.\n\nII.    THE RELEVANT FACTS. 5\n\n       A.      Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Claims From The Early\n               July 1995.\n\n        In the early 1980’s, Theodore Simonson (“Mr. Simonson”) began to explore pumicite\ndeposits 7 in California and hired Dr. Charles Chesterman to assist in that effort. PX-1. In\nNovember 1983, Mr. Simonson and his then-wife located twenty-one, forty-acre placer mining\nclaims 8 in Kern County, California, under the General Mining Law. JSF ¶ 1. In November\n1983, four mill site claims 9 also were located in Kern County, California. JSF ¶ 3. These claims\nwere named as “El Paso 1” through “El Paso 21.” JSF ¶ 1. Thereafter, Mr. Simonson drilled an\nexploratory hole on the El Paso 6 claim to determine the thickness of the “Reoforce pumicite”\n       5\n          The relevant facts discussed herein were derived from: a September 16–23, 2013 trial\n(“TR 1–1360”), where the court heard testimony and admitted: Joint Exhibits (“JX-3–81”);\nPlaintiffs’ trial exhibits (“PX-1–445”); and the Government’s trial exhibits (“DX-2–246”). In\naddition, the parties submitted a Joint Stipulation of Facts (“JSF 1–26”).\n       7\n         Pumicite is a naturally occurring amorphous (without crystal form) silica that is white to\nfaint gray with “less than one percent iron, and [] composed mostly of micron sized glassy grains\nof rhyolitic composition with some smectite and traces of calcite, quartz, feldspar, and\ncristobolite.” PX-42. Plaintiffs refer to the pumicite in this case by the name “Rheoforce” or\n“Rheolite” at different points in time. PX-3 (1987 Reoforce Business Plan) (describing\n“Rheoforce [as] the product, the concept and the company”); 9/16/13 TR 47 (Simonson).\nHerein, the court will refer to this mineral as “Reoforce pumicite.”\n       8\n         A lode claim is “[a] classic vein, ledge, or other rock in place between definite walls. A\nlode claim is located by metes and bounds.” BLM, Mining Claims and Mill Sites,\nhttp://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/info/iac/faqmc.html (last visited September 16, 2014); see also 43\nC.F.R. § 3832.21(a). Placer mining claims include “[a]ll deposits, other than lodes.” BLM,\nMining Claims and Mill Sites, http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/info/iac/faqmc.html (last visited\nSeptember 16, 2014); see also 43 C.F.R. § 3832.21(b).\n       9\n         “A mill site is a location of nonmineral land not contiguous to a vein or lode that you\ncan use for activities reasonably incident to mineral development on, or production from, the\nunpatented or patented lode or placer claim with which it is associated.” 43 C.F.R. § 3832.31.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fdeposit. 9/23/13 TR 1287 (Simonson). That effort confirmed the presence of a pumicite deposit\nthat was 14 feet thick in some locations, extending to 28 feet thick in others. Id. This was the\nonly drilling that Mr. Simonson conducted prior to the BLM entering into the MOU in August\n1995. 9/17/13 TR 492–93 (Simonson). 11\n\n         In January 1984 and March 1985, two other placer claims were located and named as “El\nPaso 22” and “El Paso 23.” JSF ¶ 1. Around this time, however, Mr. Simonson also learned that\ncertain fillers and extenders, such as crystalline silica, were carcinogenic. 9/16/13 TR 60\n(Simonson); PX-96 (describing natural silica as “contain[ing] high levels of crystalline quartz\nand crystabolite[,] which are potential carcinogens”). Consequently, Mr. Simonson had testing\nperformed on “Reoforce pumicite” to determine if it contained any quartz, rendering it\npotentially carcinogenic. 9/16/13 TR 61 (Simonson). In a January 30, 1984 letter from John A.\nKlasic, Chair of the Earth Sciences Department at California State Polytechnic University at\nPomona to Steve Ryland, a geologist who Mr. Simonson hired to assist with the development of\nthe mining claims, Professor Klasic explained that he “doubt[ed] if there is quartz in the\n[pumicite] sample.” PX-6. But Professor Klasic also cautioned that, while the “analysis was\neasy . . . , the interpretation is pure speculation.” PX-6.\n\n        In 1984, Mr. Simonson also contacted Steven Driscoll, a Professor of Plastics\nEngineering at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts and asked him to analyze “Reoforce\npumicite” to ascertain its potential use by the plastics industry. 9/16/13 TR 45–47 (Simonson).\nIn May 1984, Professor Driscoll prepared and presented a report at the Society of Plastic\nEngineers Annual Technical Conference that analyzed the benefits of using “Reoforce pumicite”\nas a mineral filler. 14 The Report concluded that “Reoforce pumicite” “offers some very\nattractive advantages,” including: (1) use as a filler in polypropylene, as it led to comparable\ntensile properties and flexural strength, improved flexural modulus, and improved\nhardness/scratch resistance and “improved handling and processability;” and (2) use as a filler in\nABS, where it led to improved tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural\nmodulus, impact strength, and improved hardness/scratch resistance and improved handling and\nprocessability. PX-7.\n\n       In September 1985, Mr. Simonson obtained, via quitclaim deed, a twenty-acre\nunpatented mining lode claim, identified and named the “Big Jim Lode claim,” that overlapped\nportions of an existing claim named El Paso 6 and El Paso 22. JSF ¶ 4.\n\n      In January 1987, DL Laboratories compared the reflectance and opacity of various\nsamples, including a sample comprising 100% Ti02 with one comprising a 40% (Ti02)/60% (a\n“Reoforce pumicite”) mixture. PX-16. The results demonstrated that, as the percentage of\n\n       11\n          This was contrary to other testimony. 9/11/13 Springer Direct Testimony, Dkt. No. 78-\n1, at 6 (“It is my understanding that only three holes had been drilled on the Reoforce claims\nbefore August 1995 and that, at most, two of those holes intercepted any pumicite.”).\n       14\n          According to Professor Driscoll, “fillers” are classified as “extenders, functional, or\nreinforcements depending upon the degree of cost reduction and enhancement of functional\nproperties in the polymeric material system.” PX-7.\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f“Reoforce pumicite” increased, reflectance decreased significantly, but opacity was largely\nunchanged. PX-16. Another test was designed to “evaluate two natural glass fillers, [the\n“Reoforce pumicite” in two different sizes and Gold Bond R,] for potential use in typical interior\nflat latex wall paints,” as an extender. PX-16. That test concluded that the 30 Micron size\n“Reoforce pumicite” functionally was equivalent, i.e., neither inferior nor superior, to Gold Bond\nR, when used in polyvinyl or ethylene vinyl acetate latex flat paints. PX-16.\n\n      On February 9, 1987, Mr. Simonson submitted a Plan Of Operations (“POO”) 17 to the\nBLM to mine approximately 100,000 tons per year from El Paso and Big Jim Lode claims. JSF\n¶ 7.\n\n        On March 1, 1987, Steve Ryland, Mr. Simonson’s geological consultant, provided BLM\nwith an addendum to the POO. PX-42. On March 3, 1987, Rheoforce filed an Application for\nan Environmental Assessment, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\n(“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321, requiring federal agencies to provide environmental reports and\nanalysis requirements when undertaking “major Federal actions significantly affecting the\nquality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C); PX-21 (March 3, 1987 Environmental\nAssessment). In March 1987, DL Laboratories also completed testing on “Reoforce pumicite,” to\n“evaluate [the] natural glass fillers submitted by [Reoforce] as partial replacements for titanium\ndioxide in an Interior Latex Flat Paint.” PX-19. Those results determined that “Reoforce\npumicite” could serve as a replacement for Titanium Oxide (“Ti02”) in certain paint\nformulations. PX-19 (“Based upon the results of this limited study, it appears that both the 16\nand 30 micron glass fillers evaluated have potential as replacements for titanium dioxide in paint\nformulations.”). In April 1987, DL Laboratories conducted additional testing, indicating that\n“Reoforce pumicite” could be used as a filler in paint and replace between 5–10% Ti02, without\ndecreasing opacity. PX-42. As a result, Mr. Simonson scheduled mining operations to\ncommence in May 1987 that were expected to yield an annual production of 100,000 tons by\n1989. JX-06.\n\n       On May 20, 1987, the BLM issued an Environmental Assessment concluding that\nReoforce’s proposed mine development would not “result in a significant adverse impact to the\nenvironment, and therefore . . . that an Environmental Impact Statement [was not] . . . required\nunder [NEPA.]” PX-21.\n\n        On May 28, 1987, the BLM, however, conditionally approved Reoforce’s POO and\naddendum, subject to twenty stipulations, including that the “material, pumicite, approved for\nextraction under this [POO] is suspected by [the BLM] as not being subject to location under the\nGeneral Mining Laws” but that a determination of that question would be made at an unspecified\ntime. PX-22. Mr. Simonson specifically was advised that, although “[y]our [POO] . . . has been\napproved,” Stipulation 1 states that, at some later time, the BLM will determine “whether the\nmining and removal of [pumicite] is permitted under the authority of the General Mining Law[.]”\n\n       17\n          The BLM requires claimants to submit a POO “before beginning operations greater\nthan casual use.” 43 C.F.R. § 3809.11(a). The BLM may revoke an approved POO, if an\noperator violates provisions in the POO. Generally, the BLM will not approve a POO until a\nmineral examination is conducted to determine whether a mining claim is valid.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fPX-22. In addition, the BLM advised that if pumicite is not locatable under the General Mining\nLaw, but was mined under an approved POO, Mr. Simonson would be required to pay a per-ton\nroyalty rate to the BLM based on prevailing market conditions. PX-24 (explaining that,\nregardless of the outcome of the uncommon/common variety determination, Mr. Simonson “will\nin no way [be] preclude[d] or prevent[ed]” from mining his claims). Mr. Simonson decided it\nwould be prudent not to begin mining until the BLM completed its common/uncommon variety\ndetermination. 9/16/13 TR 105–06 (Simonson).\n\n        On June 26, 1987, the BLM conducted a field examination of the Reoforce mining claims\nto ascertain whether the pumicite was a common variety and not “locatable.” PX-42. But, on\nJuly 2, 1987, the BLM sent a letter to Mr. Simonson to clarify “some confusion, misconception,\nand anxiety,” arising from Stipulation 1 in the May 28, 1987 approval and advise that, “[t]o put it\nsimply, your mining plan of operation has been approved[.]” PX-24. But, the July 2, 1987 letter\nalso stated that the BLM would, at some time in the future, “make a common/uncommon variety\ndetermination.” PX-24. 19\n\n        On September 4, 1987, Mr. Simonson received preliminary test results from Dr. Steven\nBlazey of A. Schulman Inc. (“Schulman”), an international supplier of high-performance plastic\ncompounds and resins. Dr. Blazey indicated that “Reoforce pumicite” was a “high quality\nspecialty silicate which imparts very good antiblock properties 20 to high quality polyolefin\nfilms,” and asked whether “Reoforce pumicite” was approved by the United States Food and\nDrug Administration (“FDA”) for consumer use. DX-74.\n\n\n       19\n            An undated memorandum from BLM’s California Desert District Manager to the\nBLM’s California State Director that appears to be of contemporaneous origin, explained that\nthis situation placed Mr. Simonson in precarious position:\n\n       Unfortunately, this puts the operator in a predicament since the feasibility of his\n       operation rests [on] being able to access this material under some form of\n       appropriation. In addition, the operator is claiming that the use and qualities of\n       the pumicite warrants an “uncommon variety” determination. . . . If the operator\n       proceeds under his plan, he risks a possible adverse determination and possible\n       trespass action.\n\nPX-28. Accordingly, the District Manager recommended that a BLM mineralogist be assigned\nto “expedite a determination of the common variety of the subject pumicite.” PX-28.\n       20\n           Antiblocking agents, also known as antiblock, are additives commonly used in plastic\nfilms and are designed to “create[] space between 2 plastic layers (surface roughness), preventing\nso-called blocking.” A. Schulman Europe, Additive Antiblock, http://www.aschulman.com/\nEurope/Masterbatch/CategoryPlusFunctionality/84096/3/Additive-Antiblock.aspx (last visited\nSept. 30, 2014); see also PX-111 (August 1994 paper written by Dr. Steven Blazey and Dr.\nValerie A. Hill, describing antiblock as “inorganic mineral or organic particles (of certain\nparticle size) which are compatible with [low-density polyethylene] and are added into films to\nroughen the surface and permit air to enter to allow easy separation of the film layers.”).\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f        In October 1987, Mr. Simonson also decided to develop an underground pumicite mine\non the twenty-three placer mining claims previously located (El Paso 1 through El Paso 23) and\nstarted the Rheoforce Filler Company, subsequently incorporated as the Rheoforce Corporation.\nJSF ¶ 2. At this time, “Mr. Simonson was the company’s sole officer and shareholder.” Id. In\nOctober 1987, Mr. Simonson also hired Abel Banhov as a consultant to complete a Business\nPlan for Reoforce focused on generating investor interest to obtain “financing of $4,000,000 to\nbring [Reoforce] to commercial reality.” PX-3. The Business Plan outlined strategic steps that\nReoforce needed to take to compete in select markets and synthesized testing results obtained to\ndate, including information pumicite deposits on the twenty-three unpatented placer mining\nclaims. PX-3. The Business Plan also included information and analysis suggesting that\n“Reoforce pumicite” could be used as a substitute for 5% to 10% of the Ti02, that was used, at\nthe time, as a “hiding pigment [to increase opacity] . . . in paint, ink, rubber, paper and plastics.”\nPX-3.\n\n       Sometime in 1987, Mr. Simonson also began discussing the potential sale of Reoforce to\nPlacer Dome US, a large commercial mining company. 9/16/13 TR 161–63 (Simonson). At that\ntime, Placer Dome US allegedly offered Mr. Simonson $100,000 to purchase the Reoforce\ndeposit that Mr. Simonson refused. 9/16/13 TR 163 (Simonson).\n\n       In February 1988, DL Laboratories also performed other tests to evaluate “Reoforce\npumicite” as a replacement for calcined clay in ceiling paint and concluded:\n\n         1. Based upon the results of this study, [Reoforce] 16 Micron Glass Filler is\n         essentially equivalent in performance to Huber 70C to the extent tested.\n\n         2. [Reoforce] 16 Micron Glass Filler exhibits slightly higher opacity and re-\n         wetted opacity.\n\nPX-26.\n\n       In March or April 1988, Mr. Simonson and Carl Engelhardt, a retained consultant,\nformulated four different paints using “Reoforce pumicite” in the 16 micron size, to reduce the\nuse of Ti02. DX-94; PX-32. In an April 13, 1988 letter to Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C.,\nMr. Engelhardt estimated that using “Reoforce pumicite” could save between 10 and 17 pounds\nof Ti02/100 gallons. PX-29. But, he clarified that, to obtain the maximum Ti02 savings using\n“Reoforce pumicite,” it was necessary to add the pumicite “in the letdown [phase] at slow speed\nfor 5 minutes[.]” PX-29.\n\n        In June or July 1988, Mr. Simonson had preliminary discussions with Engelhard\nCorporation about a partnership with “respect to future commercial development of [Reoforce]\nas a company, and [“Reoforce pumicite”] as a product line.” PX-30. Thereafter, John Thies, a\nFidelity Management employee with responsibility for overseeing investments in the plastics\nfield and an “adviser” to Mr. Simonson, explained to Engelhard Corporation that any partnership\nwith Reoforce must have two non-negotiable requirements: (1) Mr. Simonson and Mr. Thies had\nto maintain majority ownership of Reoforce and “control of the reserves through early\ncommercial development;” and (2) Mr. Simonson and Mr. Thies required project financing. PX-\n30; 9/16/13 TR 118–21 (Simonson); PX-31 (July 14, 1998 letter from Mr. Simonson to\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fEngelhard Corporation). Engelhard Corporation responded that successful development of\nReoforce would take several years of testing, analysis, and market development, and that Mr.\nSimonson would need to “cede control of all aspects of the project at the outset.” PX-30. Mr.\nSimonson decided not to pursue a partnership with Engelhard Corporation. 9/16/13 TR 122\n(Simonson). In an unaddressed August 1, 1988 marketing letter, Mr. Engelhardt explained that\n“testing has shown that [“Reoforce pumicite”] will produce equal or better paint quality and\ndepending upon the [pigment volume concentrate (“PVC”)] an 8 to 20% of additional savings of\nTitanium Dioxide with lower raw material costs.” PX-32. Thereafter, Mr. Engelhardt promoted\n“Reoforce pumicite” as an extender and partial replacement for Ti02 to various paint companies.\nPX-29; PX-32; PX42; DX-94 (all letters from Engelhardt describing positive attributes of\n“Reoforce pumicite”).\n\n        During the summer of 1988, Mr. Simonson also sent a batch of “Reoforce pumicite” to\nSuntec Paint Inc. (“Suntec”), a paint company that had been searching “for an extender which\nwould provide [them] with further savings of Ti02 without affecting the physical properties of\n[their] latex flat [paint] formulations.” PX-34. In August 1988, Suntec tested “Reoforce\npumicite” to make a “one hundred (100) gallon plant batch of [the] popular P.V.A. Latex Flat\nWhite Base [paint] at 65 PVC.” PX-34. Typically, the formula for this paint contained 125\npounds of Ti02 and 50 pounds of Silica. PX-34. In this batch, however, Suntec used 110 pounds\nof Ti02 and 50 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite,” in place of the silica, and concluded that the\nbatch made with “Reoforce pumicite” was equal in performance to the standard formula and\nproduced “a savings of 15 lbs. of Ti02 and a savings of 5 cents per gallon (with Rheolite 16M at\n.25/lb.).” PX-34. Subsequently, Suntec inquired when “Reoforce pumicite” in the 16 Micron\nsize would be available to commercial paint manufacturers. PX-34.\n\n       On September 23, 1988, Mr. Engelhardt wrote a letter to the Engelhard Corporation\nestimating that using “Reoforce pumicite” in paint formulations could save a paint company\napproximately 5 to 40 cents per gallon, assuming that the price of “Reoforce pumicite” was 25\ncents per pound and Ti02 was 99 cents per pound. PX-42.\n\n       In December 1988, Dr. Blazey of Schulman advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce\npumicite” perhaps could be used as an “antiblock in polyolefin film packaging,” and requested to\nbe apprised of the continued development and production capabilities of Reoforce. DX-69.\n\n       In a January 10, 1989 letter, Suntec Paint explained that it was willing to purchase\n“Reoforce pumicite” (16 Micron size) at $400 per ton (20 cents per pound), because it could save\nseven cents per gallon if “Reoforce pumicite” could be purchased at that price. PX-37. But,\nSuntec subsequently withdrew its interest in Reoforce. DX-189.\n\n       On February 24, 1989, PRA Laboratories performed tests that showed “Reoforce\npumicite” could save 15% of Ti02 per gallon of flax white latex base paint. PX-38; PX-39.\n\n      By April 1989, Mr. Simonson located and claimed title to 23 additional unpatented placer\nmining claims (known as the El Paso placer claims) and one unpatented lode mining claim\n(known as the Big Jim Lode claim). PX-42.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       On May 10, 1989, Lindsay Finishes Inc. advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite”\ncould save paint manufacturers approximately 28 to 30 cents per pound by using less Ti02. PX-\n41.\n\n        On May 20, 1989, based on a geological field examination, BLM finalized a Mineral\nReport about “Reoforce pumicite” deposits on the El Paso and Big Jim Lode claims (“1989\nMineral Report”). PX-42. The 1989 Mineral Report stated that “Reoforce pumicite” was “an\nuncommon variety and that its proposed use, and all of the potential uses, except soil\nconditions . . . clearly fall within a category of uncommon uses,” and a locatable mineral under\nthe General Mining Law. PX-42. It also determined that “Reoforce pumicite” could be used as\na pigment-extender for latex flat paints, potentially serving as a partial replacement for Ti02.\nPX-42 (reporting that this pumicite “will replace Ti02 for about 5 to 10% by weight and 35 to\n40% by volume, maintain a low luster (sheen) in contrast to Si02, enhance scrubbability, reduce\nweight, maintain opacity and whiteness, and cost less than Ti02”); PX-42 (listing the unique\nproperties of “Reoforce pumicite,” as “light weight, small grain size, low luster, opacity,\ndurability, scrub resistance, whiteness, and so forth,” and that it also could be used as an abrasive\nadditive). But the 1989 Mineral Report did not conclude that Mr. Simonson made a discovery of\na valuable mineral deposit under the General Mining Law and was not a validity determination. 21\nPX-42:012 (“The purpose of this study and report is to document the particulars of the common\nvariety aspects of pumicite for use in latex flat paints. This is a common variety determination\nreport and not a mining claim validity report.” 22 (emphasis added)); JSF ¶ 9. 23\n\n       On October 20, 1989, Mr. Simonson wrote to the FDA to ascertain whether “Reoforce\npumicite” could be used as a filler and antiblocking agent for certain kinds of polyolefin films\nused for packaging food. On March 12 and April 25, 1990, that inquiry was supplemented. PX-\n49; 9/16/13 TR 109, 148 (Simonson).\n\n        On October 24, 1989, BLM’s Area Manager of the Ridgecrest Office advised Mr.\nSimonson of the 1989 Mineral Report and approved Reoforce’s 1987 POO that would expire in\nfive years, i.e., by October 24, 1994. PX-42.\n\n\n\n       21\n         The General Mining Law “authorizes American citizens to ‘locate’ valid mining claims\nafter ‘discovery’ of valuable mineral deposits and compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements.” Vane Minerals (US), LLC v.

Cl. at 57. Such a determination also is referred to as a “validity examination”\nor “a mining claim validity report.” PX-42.\n       23\n       On July 6, 1989, the 1989 Mineral Report was “reviewed and acknowledged” by the\nBLM’s Associate District Manager, California Desert District, and was considered finalized.\nPX-42.\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f       On February 20, 1990, English China Clay, Inc. (“English Clay”) also tested “Reoforce\npumicite” and concluded that:\n\n       The [“Reoforce pumicite”] gives a slight dirty and yellow cask to the paint.\n       Because of this, the amount of [“Reoforce pumicite”] that can be used to replace\n       the Ti02 has to be limited to ~10% or lower.\n\nDX-94.\n\n         Around this time, the Technical Service Manager for English Clay also wrote several\nletters or communicated with Mr. Simonson and Placer Dome U.S., that it also was analyzing the\ncharacteristics of “Reoforce pumicite” to determine the potential value of a business relationship\nwith Reoforce. DX-94.\n\n        On August 16, 1990, the FDA advised Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite” was\n“relatively inert,” so that it was not necessary for him to submit additional information or file a\n“food additive petition.” PX-49.\n\n        On May 30, 1991, Sovereign Gold Ltd. (“SG”), an Australian mining company proposed\na joint venture with Mr. Simonson to develop “Reoforce pumicite,” but stated that a successful\ncommercial mining operation “requires much effort to carry from inception to the commercial\nstage.” PX-55. Specifically, SG proposed to: (1) develop “a comprehensive business plan for\nthe project” that included technical and business details, mining and processing plans, marketing\nplans, and a five year capital and operating budget that would be used to “develop financing for\nthe project;” (2) allow Mr. Simonson to be “principally involved” in the marketing efforts, but\nSG would be responsible for “developing mine and construction plans, executing those plans,”\nand managing the project prior to its commercial stage; and (3) manage the entire “pre-\ncommercial” phase of the project through a management committee, but allow Reoforce\n“complete input,” if SG’s decision would be “final and binding on both parties in the event of\ndispute.” PX-55. In exchange, Mr. Simonson needed to grant SG a two-year option on 50%\ninterest of the project. PX-55. Mr. Simonson rejected that proposal. See 9/16/13 TR 154\n(Simonson).\n\n        In June 1991, Edward F. McCarthy, a well-known executive in the industrial minerals\nbusiness, completed a report analyzing potential markets for products utilizing “Reoforce\npumicite” (“the McCarthy Report”). PX-56. 25 The McCarthy Report concluded that:\n(1) milled 26 “Reoforce pumicite” had the potential to capture approximately 55,000 tons per year\n       25\n          It is unclear whether Mr. Simonson commissioned the McCarthy Report or whether it\nwas a project conducted for Cyprus Minerals. Compare 9/18/13 TR 849 (Davis) (“Q. “And it’s\nyour assumption that [the McCarthy Report] was an independent report, correct? A. [Mr.\nMcCarthy] told me it was an independent report.”), with 9/16/13 TR 156–58 (Simonson)\n(explaining that he paid Mr. McCarthy $2,000 to obtain “his honest opinion about the [pumicite]\nand what he felt he would do as a marketing person”).\n       26\n          In this context, “milled” means products “finer than 50 mesh and does not include\nconstruction aggregates, brick clays or glass sands.” PX-56.\n\n\n                                                15\n\f“at an average realization ex mill of close to $200 per ton;” (2) major market opportunities for\n“Reoforce pumicite” were in coatings, but “Reoforce pumicite” could compete successfully in\nniche markets in plastics, rubber, and friction materials; and (3) based on the foregoing, Reoforce\ncould generate an estimated annual revenue of $10.9 million dollars. PX-56. But, the McCarthy\nReport cautioned that these conclusions would require that Reoforce engage in a “significant\nsales effort,” undertake “significant technical and developmental support,” and sell competitively\npriced products, assuming no significant changes in the regulatory atmosphere vis-à-vis\ncrystalline silica and Volatile Organic Carbon. PX-56.\n\n        On July 8, 1991, English Clay observed that “Reoforce pumicite” would “primarily\ncompete with crystalline silicas, feldspar, and (possibly) barytes as an extender for paint and\nother coatings. While [Reoforce pumicite’s] brightness is not extraordinary in its natural form, it\nis quite acceptable for use in primers and intermediate coats.” PX-436. In addition, English\nClay observed that” Reoforce pumicite” potentially could compete with other types of fillers and\nextenders, such as talcs, wallastonites, nepheline syenite, and diatomaceous earth. PX-436. But,\nit also warned that the “carcinogenicity of crystalline silica has not become a major issue in the\nmineral filler/extender market place” and, although “Reoforce pumicite’s” amorphous structure\nwas a “major selling point” in the past, “[t]oday, it is relatively unimportant.” PX-436.\n\n         On October 9, 1991, Norwegian Talc sent a letter to Mr. Simonson stating that “[a]ll\nparties agree in principle that your amorphous silica is unique in its properties and geological\ncomposition, and represent[s] a unique opportunity in the ever-increasing need to replace\ncrystalline silica in a variety of end applications[.]” PX-67. But, the letter cautioned that the\npotential applications of “Reoforce pumicite” “need to be studied in more detail in order to\nquantify the amounts of material that can be sold in the next 5–10 years.” PX-67. Further, this\nletter outlined several “steps to introduce and commercialize” “Reoforce pumicite,” including\ncustom grinding of the material in 6, 15, 45, and 60 plus micron sizes for uses as an antiblock, a\nfiller in paints and plastics, and as a “purging compound.” PX-67. And, the letter further\nexplained that Norwegian Talc’s interest in “Reoforce pumicite” was conditioned on several\nassumptions and revisions to Mr. Simonson’s business plan. PX-67 (explaining that Norwegian\nTalc’s interest was “under the assumption that [Mr. Simonson had] adequate resources, that you\nhave met all legal requirements, that you comply with all prevailing laws and regulations, and\nthat the material meets all relevant safety standards[.]”); id. (“In our view, the investment figures\nyou presented in your business plan . . . should be critically reviewed and updated.”). 27\n\n        On October 20, 1991, the Technical Service Manager for English Clay sent another letter\nto Placer Dome U.S. describing the “Reoforce pumicite” deposit as “unique,” with market\npotential, because it had a very low level of crystalline silica and “will have an application in the\npaint and plastics markets. . . . , probably be useful in caulks and sealants. . . . , [and] possibly be\nusable in inks, textiles, [and] fiberglass reinforced polyester (FRP) applications.” PX-68. But,\n“Reoforce pumicite” “would compete on a segmental basis with products that [Placer Dome\nwas] currently involved in selling/developing.” PX-68.\n\n       27\n          Sometime in 1991, Placer Dome resurrected its interest in exploring a joint venture\nwith Reoforce. PX-66 (describing interest by Placer Dome in jointly developing Reoforce\nmining claims with Norwegian Talc Minerals).\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f        On November 12, 1991, Placer Dome forwarded to Mr. Simonson “an analysis of two\ndifferent ways in which [Reoforce] can be established from marketing, production and technical\nviewpoints.” PX-70. First, Reoforce should focus its initial marketing endeavors on\nopportunities in the commercial coatings market, as the development work necessary to succeed\nin that market is “relatively straight forward; the required testing equipment is relatively\ninexpensive; and sales aids can be easily prepared for this market.” PX-70. Second, a\npartnership was proposed with Reoforce. PX-70 (explaining that working with Reoforce on a\n“partnering basis . . . would be a good example of an approach that could be taken once\nspecifications were established for a product that could be produced consistently”).\n\n      On December 5, 1991, Mr. Simonson submitted an amendment to the approved May 20,\n1987 POO to increase tonnage to 200,000 tons per year. JX-22.\n\n        On January 10, 1992, Placer Dome proposed a detailed arrangement to jointly “go\nforward with development of the [Reoforce] property as soon as possible” as it “holds the best\nchance for resolving land title issues” relating to the Reoforce mining claims. PX-76. The\nproposal explained that, “from [Placer Dome’s] viewpoint, numerous uncertainties surround the\nproject, not least of which is the apparent serious inadequacy of [Reoforce’s] title to the\nclaims . . . [which] is a serious obstacle to making a substantial investment with confidence.”\nPX-76 (emphasis added). It also provided that Placer Dome would “stake string lode\nclaims . . . along the outcrop of the pumicite bed in order to secure extralateral rights,” have 20\nacre placer claims staked over Mr. Simonson’s existing 40 acre claims to “negate any possible\nfuture challenge” to Reoforce claims, and, when “the title issues are resolved, [all] claims will be\nassignable to [Placer Dome], or to Simonson if [Placer Dome] later withdraws.” PX-76. Placer\nDome also indicated that it might, at some unidentified time, initiate a quiet title action to\nReoforce mining claims but require that Mr. Simonson indemnify Placer Dome for any “possible\nadverse outcome” from that action. PX-76. In addition, if Placer Dome was “satisfied with [Mr.\nSimonson’s] title to the property,” then it would have the option to explore and develop the\nproperty in return for an 80% equity interest in the property. PX-76. After Placer Dome\nobtained title to the Reoforce mining claims, it agreed to “retain [Mr.] Simonson’s services as\nconsultant and contractor for the marketing and sale of [the] product” for a period of three years\nat an annual rate of $100,000, with the option to renew for additional years. PX-76. And, on\ncommencement of commercial production, Placer Dome agreed to:\n\n       [m]ake a one-time payment to [Mr.] Simonson of $100,000 for every 10,000 short\n       tons of annual production (based upon the annual production as recommended in\n       [a] feasibility study ) capped at a sum of $500,000. In the event of an increase in\n       annual production beyond the initial production for which [Mr.] Simonson\n       received payment under this provision, [Mr.] Simonson shall receive an additional\n       one time payment of $100,000 for every incremental 10,000 annual tons of\n       production, still subject to the same total cap of $500,000.\n\nPX-76. In addition, Placer Dome agreed that Mr. Simonson would retain a 20% working interest\nin the property, if he provided Placer Dome with a right of first refusal and agreed to sell his\ninterest. PX-76. Mr. Simonson declined that offer. 9/16/13 TR 164 (Simonson). Thereafter, the\nPresident of Placer Dome contacted Mr. Simonson to express an interest in coming to San\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fFrancisco, California to discuss Placer Dome’s continuing interest in Reoforce. 9/16/13 TR 165\n(Simonson). Mr. Simonson refused. 9/16/13 TR 165 (Simonson).\n\n      On February 19, 1992, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that a New Environmental\nAssessment was required “because of the proposed increase in the scale of operation[.]” PX-78.\n\n        Around March 1992, General Electric Silicones (“GE Silicones”) inquired whether it\ncould perform a plant evaluation of “Reoforce pumicite” and requested a minimum of 500\npounds (maximum of 750 pounds) to “verify the physical property profile, including shelf life\nand application testing” of the pumicite. DX-61. GE Silicones indicated that if this testing were\nsuccessful, it may require “around 10,000lbs of [“Reoforce pumicite”] per week, rising to 20,000\nlbs. per week within 1 year.” DX-61. This interest was based on the carcinogenic nature of\ncrystalline silicas. DX-61 (“Based on the . . . known health problems with crystalline silicas,\n[General Electric Silicones is] interested in evaluating these volcanic glasses.”). In response, Mr.\nSimonson extracted approximately 750 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite” from the portal area\nusing a compressor as a jackhammer. 9/16/13 TR 88 (Simonson) (“So we went out physically,\nand we bagged [the pumicite] up again . . . . [and] I supplied 750 pounds of a precise\nmaterial[.]”). After testing how “Reoforce pumicite” could repel the absorption of water, GE\nSilicones subsequently created a finished silicone spray, using pumicite in lieu of Min-U-Sil, a\nfine ground silica product used by GE Silicones. 9/16/13 TR 91 (Simonson); see also US Silica,\nFine Ground Silica, http://www.ussilica.com/products/fine-ground-silica (last visited Sept. 29,\n2014) (describing the benefits of silica). But, GE Silicones never executed any purchase orders\nfrom Mr. Simonson. 9/17/13 TR 513–14 (Simonson).\n\n        On May 8, 1992, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that, based on the level of disturbance\nassociated with the Reoforce mines, a SMARA Reclamation Plan and bond were required. JX-\n21. The BLM also explained that, because of an “access road . . . recently constructed on the Big\nJim Lode Claim,” Reoforce was not in compliance with Stipulations 3 and 7 of the 1987 POO,\nbut did not issue a Notice of Non-Compliance. JX-21.\n\n        On May 18, 1992, the BLM issued a supplemental Environmental Assessment of\nReoforce’s 1991 proposed modification to the 1987 POO. PX-85. BLM explained that the\nproposed modification would increase the authorized production tonnage to 200,000 tons,\nresulting in an increase in the number of truck trips from 16 to 32. PX-85. Nevertheless, the\nBLM determined that the “direct and indirect of the proposed action are not significantly\ndifferent than those identified in the [Environmental Assessment].” PX-85. Therefore, the BLM\nconcluded that Reoforce’s amended POO would have no significant adverse impact on the\nenvironment, so that no Environmental Impact Statement was required under the NEPA. PX-85.\n\n        On May 21, 1992, the BLM approved the BLM’s supplemental environmental\nassessment, and informed Mr. Simonson that he was required to abide by the May 28, 1987 POO\nand five new stipulations to minimize impact on the desert tortoise. JX-22. Several of these\nstipulations, however, required “approval from BLM before any enlargement of the portal area,\nroad construction, or underground mining may begin.” JX-22.\n\n       On August 6, 1992, the Kern County Planning and Development Services Department\ninformed Mr. Simonson that the Reoforce mining claims “would not come under the\n\n\n                                                18\n\frequirements of [SMARA] as [they] did not disturb more than an acre of surface area.” JX-23.\nKern County advised, however, that if the project expanded in scope, a reclamation plan would\nbe necessary. JX-23.\n\n       On November 18, 1992, Dr. Blazey of Schulman wrote Mr. Simonson a letter to express\npreliminary interest in using “Reoforce pumicite” as an antiblocking agent based on “some\npreliminary investigation,” because the small micron size of “Reoforce pumicite”\n\n         works very well as an antiblock in oriented propylene films. These[] results are\n         promising in lieu of the current use of synthetic silica which is priced at between\n         $1.60 and $2.00 per pound. The market for synthetic silica in oriented propylene\n         films is several million pounds per year. Although [“Reoforce pumicite”] may\n         not completely overtake this market, the use of this material offers a definite\n         cost/performance advantage over current synthetic silica.\n\nPX-96.\n\n        Mr. Blazey also indicated that “Reoforce pumicite” had potential in other applications in\npaints and plastics. PX-96. Although natural silica was the “industry standard,” in Dr. Blazey’s\nopinion, the non-carcinogenic characteristics of “Reoforce pumicite” placed it in an\nadvantageous market position. PX-96 (explaining that “Reoforce pumicite” showed “some\ninitial promise” as an antiblocking agent, because “natural silica . . . contains high levels of\ncrystalline quartz and crystabolite which are potential carcinogens”).\n\n      On January 8, 1993, the BLM inspected the Reoforce mining claims to determine\nwhether the mine portal area and adjacent roads negatively impacted the desert tortoise. DX-17.\n\n        On February 1, 1993, the BLM informed Mr. Simonson that he needed to submit\n“information required by Stipulations No. 5 and 8 of [Reoforce’s May 28, 1987] approved plan\n[of operations] to [the BLM] as a proposed mine plan modification.” DX-17. Specifically,\nStipulation 5 required that Reoforce submit detailed engineering plans “prior to enlargement of\nthe portal area and road construction” and Stipulation 8 required that Reoforce’s POO was\nsubject to approval of a “comprehensive road maintenance program,” if and when Reoforce\nbegan commercially to mine its claims. PX-22.\n\n        In March and April 1993, approximately six years after the BLM approved Reoforce’s\nPOO on May 28, 1987, Mr. Simonson cleared the “portal area” or “staging area” on the south-\neasterly end of the El Paso 6 claim (later relocated as El Paso 6A), portions of the Big Jim Lode\nclaim, and the El Paso 22 placer claim (later relocated as El Paso 22A). JSF ¶ 11. This work\nincluded blasting and grading. JSF ¶ 11.\n\n       In May 1993, a Mining Engineer and Professor at the Colorado School of Mines,\ncompleted an Underground Pumicite Mine Conceptual Design Report, commissioned by Mr.\nSimonson (the “1993 Colorado Mining Report”). PX-103. Based on the 1993 Colorado Mining\nReport, Mr. Simonson decided to mine the Reoforce claims, using a “room and pillar” method 29\n         29\n          Room and pillar mining is a system where material is extracted across a horizontal\nplane, creating an array of horizontal rooms and pillars. “Pillars” of untouched mined material\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fthat previously was used on the Cudahy or the Old Dutch Cleanser Mine. 9/16/13 TR 147–48\n(Simonson). The 1993 Colorado Mining Report explained that this method was “designed to\nproduce a high purity, uncontaminated, product by mechanically mining excavations entirely\nwithin the pumicite.” PX-103. Mr. Simonson decided instead to use a large-scale cleaner to\n“vacuum the material out so it would never be exposed to quartz crystalline. It would go directly\ninto the vacuum cleaner and then drop down into a 70-ton hopper[,]” several thousand feet from\nthe mine. 9/16/13 TR 197, 348–49 (Simonson).\n\n       On July 18, 1994, Dr. Blazey sent Mr. Simonson a fax to follow-up on the progress of the\nmining and grinding of “Reoforce pumicite.” PX-109. Therein, Dr. Blazey stated that although\na competitor of Schulman, Techmer PM, expressed an interest in “Reoforce pumicite,” Dr.\nBlazey “want[ed] A. Schulman to be the first to advertise and get this material on the market for\nsale.” PX-109; see also 9/19/13 TR 1072 (Blazey).\n\n       On August 4, 1994, Mr. Simonson renamed Rheoforce Corporation as Reoforce, Inc.\nunder the laws of the State of Delaware. JSF ¶ 15. Later that month, Kern County informed Mr.\nSimonson that, should the Reoforce mines disturb in excess of one-acre, a reclamation plan was\nrequired under SMARA. JX-28. Mr. Simonson did not submit a reclamation plan. 9/16/13 TR\n189 (Simonson).\n\n        Between August 10 and 11, 1994, Dr. Blazey, in collaboration with Dr. Valerie Hill of\nSchulman, presented a paper to the Clemson University Technical Conference (“the 1994\nPaper”) on the potential for replacing crystalline silica in polyethylene films. PX-111. This\npaper analyzed the performance characteristics of different antiblocking substances, including an\nunnamed “natural silica (volcanic glass).” It concluded that an unidentified “natural silica\n(volcanic glass)” exhibited equal antiblocking performance to the industry standard crystalline\nsilica and was not hazardous. PX-111. 31\n\n       On August 31, 1994, however, Mr. Simonson failed to pay the BLM statutorily-mandated\nmaintenance fees for the El Paso placer claims, Big Jim Lode claim, and mill site claims, so that\nthe BLM declared these claims were forfeited by operation of law. JSF ¶ 12.\n\n       On September 26, 1994, Mr. Simonson and Ronald Stehn re-identified and relocated\ntwenty-three placer mining claims that they named “El Paso 1A” through “El Paso 23A.” JSF\n¶ 13. Each “A” claim corresponded with the original El Paso mining claims that Mr. Simonson\n\n\n\n\nare left in place to support the roof of mine, while the “rooms” are extracted before the pillars are\npartially extracted. See Kentucky Geological Survey, Methods of Mining, http://www.uky.edu\n/KGS/coal/coal_mining.htm (last visited Sept. 29, 2014).\n       31\n         At trial, Dr. Blazey could not recall whether the “natural silica,” referenced in the 1994\nPaper was “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/19/13 TR 1074. Dr. Blazey admitted, however, that the 1994\nPaper was prepared at the time that Schulman was testing “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/19/13 TR\n1074 (Blazey).\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\flocated between 1983 and 1985. JSF ¶ 13. 33 These claims occupied “the identical location as\nthe lapsed claims, consisting of approximately 920 acres.” PX-439. 34\n\n        On January 25, 1995, Schulman sent Mr. Simonson a purchase order for 5,000 pounds of\n“Reoforce pumicite,” size R-100, at a price of $330/ton. PX-116. On March 17, 1995,\nSchulman sent another purchase order for 5,000 pounds of “Reoforce pumicite” size R-106, at a\nprice of $475/metric ton. PX-121. These purchase orders were issued to perform batch testing\nand generate sample formulations of plastic compounds using “Reoforce pumicite” to send to A.\nSchulman’s customers. 9/19/13 TR 1063–64 (Blazey). In the Spring of 1995, Reoforce mined\napproximately 200 tons of the pumicite, in part to fulfill orders from Schulman. 9/17/13 TR 426\n(Simonson). At trial, however, neither Mr. Simonson nor Dr. Blazey could remember if\nSchulman ever conducted testing on “Reoforce pumicite.” 9/17/13 TR 433 (Simonson).\n\n        Sometime in early 1995, Mr. Simonson decided that “Reoforce pumicite” would have to\nbe ground to particular micron sizes for different potential applications. 9/16/13 TR 228\n(Simonson). To accomplish this objective, Mr. Simonson purchased ball mill, refurbished the\nengines, cleaned out the lines and processing area, and purchased ceramic balls to crush material\ninto a uniform size. 35 9/16/13 TR 212–15 (Simonson). Mr. Simonson also arranged to transport\n“Reoforce pumicite” to the ball mill in Victorville, California. 9/16/13 TR 217 (Simonson).\nThereafter, Mr. Simonson entered into a contractual arrangement with ProTech Minerals,\n\n       33\n           Although those claims had different numbering than predecessor claims, the BLM\ntreated the May 28, 1987 POO as “fully applicable” to the “El Paso A” claims. PX-439 (“The\nparties agree that the previously approved [POO] are fully applicable to the [new El Paso “A”]\nclaims[.]”).\n       34\n          In November 1994, the BLM prepared to transfer title of certain designated lands to the\nState, but the State declined to accept title of any pre-existing mining claims. JSF ¶ 17; see also\n62 FED. REG. at 26324-01 (withdrawing lands on which the Reoforce mining claims are located\n“[s]ubject to valid existing rights”). The BLM canceled existing patents on the land, and issued a\nnew patent to the State in November 1996, but it omitted all lands encumbered by unpatented\nmining claims. JSF ¶ 17.\n\n        On May 18, 1995, the BLM proposed to withdraw lands designated by Section 701 of the\nCalifornia Desert Protection Act (“Withdrawal Area”) from settlement, sale, location, or entry\nunder the existing land and mineral laws. See Proposed Withdrawal; California, 60 FED. REG.\n26736 (May 18, 1995) (“Proposed Withdrawal”). The purpose of the Proposed Withdrawal was\nto protect values of the designated area until they could be conveyed to California. Id.\nAccordingly, the Proposed Withdrawal “segregated” lands within the area of the Proposed\nWithdrawal, i.e., “close[d] the lands for up to two years from all the public land and mineral laws\nexcept conveyances under [Section] 701 of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 (108\nStat. 4471).” Id.. But, the BLM again emphasized, “[e]xisting rights are not affected by this\nwithdrawal.” 60 FED. REG. at 26736.\n       35\n         A ball mill is a device where material is loaded into a large drum that rotates, moving\nceramic balls to crush the material into a fine powder.\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fwhereby he agreed to pay a fixed fee per-ton of pumicite that was processed or milled at the\nplant. 9/16/13 TR 213−14 (Simonson).\n\n       In the spring of 1995, Mr. Simonson mined approximately 200 tons of pumicite from the\nReoforce claims in order to fulfill the January and March 1995 Schulman purchase orders.\n9/16/13 TR 212, 218; 9/17/13 TR 425−26 (Simonson).\n\n        In June 1995, Mr. Simonson requested that Micromeritics Instrument Corporation\nconduct an analysis of two different sizes of the milled “Reoforce pumicite,” one known as R-\n106 and the other as R-100, to determine whether these samples were uniformly sized and\nsuitable for Schulman orders. PX-128; 9/16/13 TR 228 (Simonson). The test was positive.\n9/16/13 TR 229–30 (Simonson). Thereafter, Mr. Simonson milled 100 tons of the mined\npumicite over a two day period at the Victorville mill into uniform sizes. 9/16/13 TR 218, 228\n(Simonson); 9/17/13 TR 426–27 (Simonson). Mr. Simonson then sold five tons of the processed\nand milled pumicite to Schulman to fill the January and March of 1995 orders, and put the\nremaining 195 tons in a warehouse. 9/17/13 TR 427 (Simonson).\n\n       B.      On August 7, 1995, The Bureau Of Land Management Entered Into A\n               Memorandum Of Understanding With The State Of California.\n\n         On August 7, 1995, the BLM State Office Director and the Director of the California\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to\nprovide for the management and administration of public lands within Red Rock Canyon State\nPark that were designated under Section 701 of the California Desert Protection Act other than\nunpatented mining claims. JX-034 (“The purpose of this MOU is to provide for the management\nand administration of public lands within the Red Rock Canyon State Park that are not conveyed\nto the State [of California] pursuant to Section 701 of the California Desert Protection\nAct . . . due to being encumbered by unpatented mining claims.”). The August 7, 1995 MOU\nexplained that the BLM would conduct validity examinations of the mining claims located in the\nproposed Withdrawal Area “prior to review and approval of any [plan of operations],” in\naccordance with the following procedures:\n\n       Group one – Claims and Sites with no POOs.\n\n       This group is defined as claims and sites with no current activity, and no existing\n       plan. BLM action on these claims and sites will commence when the operator or\n       claimant comes forward with a POO under 43 CFR 3809. At that time, a validity\n       examination will be performed by a certified mineral examiner, to determine if\n       [validity] exists. If it does, the State of California will be notified of the results of\n       the examination, and BLM will proceed to review the POO. If no [validity]\n       exists, the plan shall be denied and a mineral contest issued against the claims\n       [will be initiated], through the BLM State Office.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       Group Two – Claims and Sites with Existing POOs for Exploration\n       Activities.\n\n       Existing POOs issued pursuant to 43 CFR 3809 for exploration activities (not for\n       producing mines) are to be suspended until a [validity] determination can be\n       completed by a certified mineral examiner. This suspension is necessary as rights\n       against the United States cannot accrue on or after the date of the CDPA, October\n       31, 1994.\n\n       Group Three – Claims and Sites with Existing POOs for Producing Mines\n\n       This group is restricted to operating mines under existing POOs, those diligently\n       and continuously extracting and marketing ores and related commodities from\n       their mining claims and sites. In these circumstances, [the validity determination]\n       will be preliminarily presumed on an interim basis, by evidence of continuous\n       extraction and marketing of the mineral commodity. These producing mines will\n       be allowed to continue operating, pending final determination of [validity].\n\nJX-34 (MOU) (emphasis added).\n\n       The MOU also outlined the responsibilities of BLM and California for the lands within\nthe proposed Withdrawal Area. JX-34.\n\n        In a July 12, 1995 letter, the BLM’s Acting Director of the Ridgecrest Office informed\nMr. Simonson that a formal MOU with the State was forthcoming and “for every existing\noperation and every proposed operation to occur on unpatented federal mining claims within the\n[Red Rock State] Park, BLM must complete a validity exam of the claims(s) prior to approval of\nthe mining [POO].” DX-19. But the letter stated that “[f]or operations such as yours, you will be\nallowed to continue in accordance with your approved mining [POO] while the validity exam\nprocess is completed for your claims.” DX-19 (emphasis added). 40\n\n        On August 10, 1995, a form letter was sent to all mining claimants with unpatented\nmining claims within the Withdrawal Area, wherein the BLM California State Director advised\nclaimants “how BLM and the State are working cooperatively to meet the intent and spirit of\nCongress to convey [lands covered by the CDPA] to the State, and to detail how lands covered\nwith unpatented mining claims will be managed.” JX-34; 9/16/13 TR 230 (Simonson). The\nletter emphasized that mining claims located in the Withdrawal Area prior to October 31, 1994\n“may have valid existing rights (VER) . . . predicated on the discovery by that date of a valuable\nmineral deposit[.]” JX-34. But, to have valid existing rights, “a miner must at least demonstrate\nthat he or she is mining or could have been mining for a profit before . . . October 31,\n1994. . . . [so that the] mere location of a mining claim, and filing of annual assessment work or\nfees is not sufficient to demonstrate that a discovery mining has been made.” JX-34 (emphasis\n\n\n       40\n          According to Mr. Simonson, he did not receive a copy of that letter until approximately\nten years later through discovery in this case. 9/17/13 TR 355 (Simonson).\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fadded). The BLM also enclosed a copy of the MOU to explain how “valid existing rights will be\nevaluated.” JX-34; 9/16/13 TR 230 (Simonson).\n\n        At trial, Mr. Simonson testified that, when the August 7, 1995 MOU issued, he believed\nthat the Reoforce mining claims fell into Group 2.\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          In my reading, I was in group two [of the MOU], with my\n                              plan of operation [being previously approved] and [the\n                              Reoforce mines] not in full production.\n\n       Q.                     So, why did you think you were in group two?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          I wasn’t in full production.\n\n9/16/13 TR 231; PX-34 (describing requirements for Group 2).\n\n                                             * * *\n\n       Q.                     Mr. Simonson, did you continue mining after August 10th,\n                              199[5]?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON           No. . . .\n\n       THE COURT:             You didn’t take samples out or anything else after that?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          No.\n\n       THE COURT:             Okay. Why?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          Well, I had plenty [of samples] . . . . And also, I felt\n                              strongly that I could not mine.\n\n       THE COURT:             Because?\n\n       MR. SIMONSON:          A validity exam had to be done.\n\n9/16/13 TR 232−33; JX-34 (explaining, in Group Two, existing plans of operations “issued[,]\npursuant to 43 C.F.R 3809 for exploration activities (not for producing mines) are to be\nsuspended until a [validity] determination can be completed by a certified mineral examiner”).\n\n        At trial, Mr. Simonson acknowledged that he received a copy of the August 7, 1995\nMOU, but stated that the BLM never advised him that he could not continue to mine under the\nexisting POO. 9/17/13 TR 439–42 (Simonson). 41\n\n\n       41\n            An August 1995 internal memorandum from the California BLM State Director\nreflects that: “Verbal direction from California Minerals Deputy State Director to reprioritize the\nSimonson case to a delayed status.” PX-334.\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f       C.     Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Clams After The August\n              7, 1995 Memorandum Of Understanding Was Operational.\n\n        On October 18, 1995, Reoforce received a permit to use underground diesel engines from\nthe California Division of Occupational Safety Office (“Cal OSHA”). PX-142. On October 19,\n1995, Cal OSHA issued a report classifying the Reoforce mine as “Nongassy with Special\nConditions,” i.e., requiring Reoforce to develop testing of the underground environment at the\nstart of each working shift “to detect for adequate oxygen and toxic and explosive gases or\nvapors before anyone enters said environment;” and to ventilate the mines to meet “respirable\ndust requirements.” PX-144. On October 19, 1995, Reoforce became subject to other oversight\nand additional requirements imposed by the Cal OSHA. PX-144 (Cal OSHA Underground\nClassification Report).\n\n        On October 21, 1995, Cal OSHA conducted an inspection at the Reoforce site, and issued\na Notice of No Violation, because Reoforce “filled out and . . . implemented” the required Injury\nand Illness Prevention Program model plan. PX-145.\n\n        On November 13, 1995, the BLM informed Reoforce that, because it exceeded the one-\nacre disturbance threshold under SMARA, a reclamation plan and reclamation bond were\nrequired, but failed to notify Mr. Simonson that the prior May 28, 1987 POO was suspended.\nDX-131; DX-21. 42 Mr. Simonson thought the BLM required a reclamation plan, but he was\nunable to finalize a completed plan at that time or in 1996. 9/17/13 TR 482–83 (Simonson)\n(describing multiple but failed attempts to submit a SMARA reclamation plan).\n\n        Between January 17 and January 20, 1996, Hackworth Drilling Company, Mr. Simonson,\nand Peter Milne drilled two exploratory holes on El Paso 7 (now 7A) at the Reoforce mining\nclaims. DX-156; 9/17/13 TR 491–92 (Simonson). On January 20, 1996, Reoforce also\nconvened a first annual shareholders meeting where a Board of Directors (the “Reoforce Board”)\nand corporate officers were elected, and financial planning, organization, and future business\nwas discussed, including “pending orders, pending legal actions, [and] expected expenditures.”\nDX-177. The meeting notes showed cash on hand was $14,000. DX-177. There is no mention\nthat Reoforce’s May 28, 1987 POO had been suspended. DX-177. Mr. Simonson was forced to\nstep down as the President of Reoforce Inc., and another shareholder, John Foggan, assumed that\nposition. DX-148; DX-177; 9/16/13 TR 253−55 (Simonson). Thereafter Reoforce began to use\nthe name “the Foggan Group.” 9/17/13 TR 414 (Simonson).\n\n       In 1997, the company entered into a joint venture with IMV-Nevada, Bill Wahl, the\nowner and President of the Lime Mountain Company, and a geologist, David Klise, of LOK\nEnvironmental, Inc. JX-40 (proposed joint venture agreement); DX-150 (describing the\n\n       42\n          Mr. Simonson estimated that between 1984 and 1995, he spent around $500,000 to\n$550,000 to develop the mining claims for the commercial production of pumicite as a filler and\nextender in paints and plastics. 9/17/13 TR 405–06 (Simonson). Some of that money was raised\nby Reoforce investors and the rest was Mr. Simonson’s personal money. 9/17/13 TR 496\n(Simonson). But by August 1995, “most of that money had been spent” and no new investors\nwere on the horizon. Id.\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f“contractual arrangement”). The objective of the joint venture was to obtain permits for, and\nbegin to develop, Reoforce mining claims to facilitate “commercial production of [“Reoforce\npumicite”].” On January 12, 1997, Mr. Simonson and Mr. Stehn transferred their interests in El\nPaso 1A through El Paso 23A placer claims, via a quitclaim deed, to Reoforce, Inc. JSF ¶ 21.\n\n       On February 4, 1996, the Reoforce Board discussed a plan “to extract approximately 200\nmore tons of product sometime in late March or April.” DX-187. Again, there was no mention\nthat Reoforce’s POO was suspended at that or any other Board meeting. DX-188 (March 2,\n1996, minutes); DX-189 (April 2, 1996 minutes); DX-190 (Jan. 4, 1997 minutes); DX-191 (Jan.\n29, 1998 minutes); DX-176 (Sept. 16, 2002 minutes). 43 Instead, the notes reflect a company in\ndecline and diminishing business prospects. DX-188 (listing the cash on hand, as of March 2,\n1996, as $8,500); DX-189 (listing the cash on hand, as of April 2, 1996, as $7,500, and the “sale\nof some assets [was required] to maintain corporation while awaiting sale of product” was\nrequired); DX-191 (“No other leads at this time.”).\n\n       D.      On May 13, 1997, The Bureau of Land Management Withdrew Certain\n               Public Lands, “Subject To Valid Existing Rights” And Subsequent Activities\n               Regarding Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining Claims Until March 2006.\n\n        As anticipated by the August 7, 1995 MOU, on May 13, 1997, BLM finally withdrew the\nlands designated by Section 701 of the CPDA from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the\nUnited States land and mineral laws. See PUBLIC LAND ORDER NO. 7620; WITHDRAWAL OF\nPUBLIC LANDS FOR RED ROCK CANYON STATE PARK; CA, 62 FED. REG. 26324 (May 13, 1997)\n(“This order withdraws 8,896 acres of public lands from all public land and mineral laws[,]\nexcept conveyances under Section 701 of the [CDPA] of 1994, for a period of 20 years to protect\nthe park resources of the lands until they can be conveyed to the State of California as mandated\nby Congress.”). The withdrawal, however, was “subject to [any] valid existing [mineral] rights.”\nId. Although the August 7, 1995 MOOU anticipated conducting a validity determination on all\nmining claims located in the Withdrawal Area, Plaintiffs’ mining claims were never noticed for a\nvalidity hearing. Likewise, the August 7, 1995 MOU anticipated that the validity determinations\nwould be conducted before the BLM would approve of any POO, but Plaintiffs’ May 28, 1987\napproved POO was never rescinded and did not undergo any additional review of Plaintiffs’\nclaims.\n\n       On October 9, 1997, Bill Swanson submitted a Mining Operation Annual Report to the\nCalifornia Department of Conservation that listed the status of the Reoforce mines as “Active.”\nDX-195.\n\n         In late 1997, Kern County informed Reoforce that the total acreage of surface disturbance\naffected by the Reoforce mines was 1.25 acres. DX-195. Thereafter, Reoforce “submitted the\nfirst of what would become several reclamation plan applications to Kern County for review.”\nDX-131.\n\n       43\n          A March 22, 1996 letter from the BLM to Kern County “regarding Mr. Simonson’s\noperations in Red Rock State Park” also made no mention that the Reoforce POO was\nsuspended. DX-151.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f        The January 29, 1998 notes of the Reoforce Board reflect that “Bill Wahl . . . told [Mr.]\nFoggan that the BLM is satisfied with the mining plan and has allowed mining to begin at any\ntime.” DX-191. In April 1998, Mr. Wahl submitted a SMARA application to Kern County on\nbehalf of “the Foggan Group.” DX-143 (SMARA application); DX-145 (letter transmitting\nSMARA application on April 29, 1998). The Foggan Group submitted a SMARA application\nstating the proposed starting date of mining operations as late 1999. DX-144. Mr. Klise and Mr.\nWahl also submitted a new POO to BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office on behalf of the Foggan\nGroup. JX-041. The proposed plan anticipated underground bulk sampling and testing of\n“Reoforce pumicite.” JX-041.\n\n       On April 15, 1998, Riverfront Corporation (“Riverfront”) sent a letter to John Foggan\nexplaining that it was “very interested in the possibility of purchasing your company’s pumicite\nclaims, [and] would like an opportunity to review” information pertaining to the status and\ndevelopment of the mining claims. PX-161. Mr. Simonson was bcc’d on the letter. PX-161;\n9/16/13 TR 260 (Simonson). Riverfront, however, never made a formal offer to purchase\nReoforce’s mining claims. 9/16/13 TR 260 (Simonson).\n\n        On July 2, 1998, Kern County informed the Foggan Group that its POO was not\nadequate, because certain “items were either not included or not sufficiently addressed.” DX-\n142. Thereafter, neither the Foggan Group nor Mr. Wahl took any action to cure these\ndeficiencies. JX-043.\n\n        In August 1998, J.M. Huber Corporation expressed preliminary interest in Reoforce\npumicite, indicating that it “could conceivably fill a profitable niche in Huber’s family of\nfunctional fillers and extenders.” PX-33. After conducting testing and analysis on December 8,\n1988, J.M. Huber informed Mr. Simonson that “Reoforce pumicite” was not “functionally\ncompetitive with the control material [they] studied in [a] series of tests, . . . showed no\nadvantage in hiding power (opacity) or scrub resistance over [other] natural ground silica,” and\ncreated a “noticeably darker paint.” DX 207. J.M. Huber advised, however, that further\ndevelopment of “Reoforce pumicite” would make sense, if it could be priced competitively, i.e.,\nin the range of 5–10 cents per pound. DX-207. 44\n\n       There is no evidence in the record of any activity on the Reoforce mining claims from\n1999 through 2000.\n\n       On January 8, 2001, Mr. Simonson wrote a letter to the BLM requesting an extension of\nReoforce’s POO. JX-46. Therein, Mr. Simonson stated that he intended “to begin mining and to\nbring [“Reoforce pumicite”] . . . to the long waited markets” and thanked the BLM for its\npatience regarding the Reoforce mining claims. JX-46 (emphasis added).\n\n\n       44\n          Mr. Simonson testified several years later that J.M. Huber displayed a renewed interest\nin purchasing Reoforce. 9/16/13 TR 277–79 (Simonson). But, according to Mr. Simonson,\nbecause J.M. Huber wanted to purchase “Reoforce pumicite” to keep it off the market to prevent\nit from competing with the precipitated silica they currently sold, he refused the offer. 9/16/13\nTR 280 (Simonson).\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f        On January 17, 2001, the BLM determined, based on a recent inspection of the Reoforce\nmining claims, “there has been no changes and no work performed [t]here for greater than two\nyears.” DX-27. Therefore, the BLM found that the Reoforce mine site was in “non-operation,”\nbut not in compliance with 43 C.F.R. § 3715.3-1(b), and instructed Mr. Simonson to remove “all\nproperty and reclaim” the Reoforce site within ninety days. DX-27. The BLM also informed\nMr. Simonson that, if he disagreed, he could respond in writing within 30 days to Kern County\ndemonstrating that he was in compliance with all state-level environmental and reclamation\nrequirements. DX-27.\n\n        On February 22, 2001, the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office followed up with Mr.\nSimonson, explaining that the Reoforce claims were in non-operation, “simply because [the\nBLM] could see no observable development on the claim[s] since approximately 1995.” DX-30.\nThe BLM also asked Mr. Simonson to verify whether that observation was correct, and if not, to\ndescribe the mining operations conducted since 1995, as the agency “had no wish to shut down a\nproductive mining operation,” but “if [Mr. Simonson’s] equipment is not actually being used,\nthen there is no reason to keep it on public lands.” DX-30. 45\n\n        On September 6, 2002, Mr. Simonson again became President of Reoforce, Inc. after\nother stockholders withdrew their investments and began marketing Reoforce pumicite. 9/16/13\nTR 258 (Simonson); DX-176 (Sept. 8, 2002 Agreement between Reoforce and Mr. Simonson).\nOn November 3, 2002, Mr. Simonson wrote a letter to the California Department of Parks and\nRecreation stating that he obtained an approved POO and that the BLM’s 1989\nuncommon/common variety determination had “given [him] the right to mine” the Reoforce\nclaims. DX-137. After filing several incomplete or deficient applications for approval of a\nreclamation plan that Kern County rejected, Reoforce successfully completed an application in\n“late 2002.” DX-131.\n\n       On December 16, 2002, BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office forwarded the Kern County\nPlanning Department comments about Reoforce’s reclamation plan, explaining that the BLM’s\n1989 approval was contingent on Reoforce complying with Stipulations 5, 9, and 10 in the 1989\napproval. JX-51. In addition, when Reoforce amended its plan,\n\n         [f]ederal regulations will require BLM’s approval of these amendments per 43\n         CFR 3809. A corollary to that approval is BLM’s obligation to perform a validity\n         examination of the mining claim per 43 CFR 3809.100.\nJX-51.\n\n       On February 20, 2003, Mr. Simonson asked the FDA whether “Reoforce pumicite” could\nbe “use[d] as an anticaking agent in food salts.” PX-216. On March 24, 2003, the FDA\nresponded that it did not have any “toxicological concerns” regarding the level of potassium\noxide in “Reoforce pumicite,” if it was used an anticaking agent at a “use level of 1.7%.” PX-\n         45\n           On January 10, 2001, Mr. Wahl also informed the BLM that he was no longer\ninterested in the joint venture, because Mr. Simonson “seems to be acting on his own, outside the\ninterests of Foggan’s Group. . . . [and because Mr. Simonson] wants to build a multi-million\ndollar mill and start mining with little thought for product research and market analysis.” JX-47.\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f216. But, the FDA advised that because of atypically high levels of lead and arsenic in\n“Reoforce pumicite,” the FDA did “not consider your material to be food grade” for use as an\nanticaking agent. PX-216.\n\n       On April 21, 2003 Reoforce filed a SMARA application that proposed to commence\nmining, as soon as Kern County approved Reoforce’s reclamation plan. DX-132. 46\n\n        In May 2003, Reoforce’s 1987 reclamation plan was revised to reflect comments\nreceived from Kern County, the BLM, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation.\nDX-131. For example, the California Department of Parks and Recreation stated that, based on\nthe information Reoforce provided, it was “somewhat difficult to envision that an annual\nproduction level of 50,000, let alone 250,000 tons . . . could be feasibly mined per annum by six\nemployees, hauling through a single specified portal against gravity,” and further stated that it\nwas “difficult to comprehend” this level of commercial mining taking place on the existing\nmining platform Reoforce excavated. DX-131. Therefore, Kern County required Reoforce to\npost a $7,432.07 bond to reclaim the 1.85 acres of disturbed by the Reoforce claims. DX-131.\n\n       On July 24, 2003, the Kern County Planning Commission approved a conditional use\npermit of Reoforce’s “reclamation plan for aboveground surface disturbance.” DX-131.\n\n         On July 26, 2003, Mr. Simonson wrote to the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office and\nrequested a validity exam of Reoforce’s mining claims. DX-37 (“If your office is going to\ninitiate a determination on my valid existing rights, it would be imperative that you start your\nexamination as soon as possible, for I am ready to commence my approved mining operation”).\nMr. Simonson explained that the delay in receiving approval from Kern County “hindered the\nmining of this pumicite.” DX-37.\n\n       On August 12, 2003, the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office sent a letter to Mr. Simonson’s\ncounsel stating:\n\n       The Foggan Group Organization once desired to move a large bulk sample of\n       pumicite from the El Paso Mining Claims, presumably to evaluate its\n       marketability. They submitted a separate and independent proposal for this. The\n       BLM treated this proposal in accordance with the [MOU] signed in 1995\n       (enclosed). That is, that no disturbance can be approved until the validity of these\n       claims is determined.\n\nPX-232 (emphasis added); DX-108 (same); DX-49 (same); DX-54 (describing the Foggan\nGroup’s separate proposal for bulk sampling as being “placed in suspense until completion of a\n\n       46\n           Although the Reoforce mining claims are located on BLM-managed federal lands,\nCalifornia also retains some regulatory control over those lands. For example, the Kern County\nPlanning Department and Kern County Planning Commission had authority to ensure\ncompliance with SMARA. DX-131 (“Approval of a reclamation plan and its content as\nidentified by SMARA and the State Mining and Geology Board guidelines are the extent of Kern\nCounty’s responsibilities[.]”).\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fvalidity examination for the affected mining claims”); DX-78 (1998 statement by BLM that\n“mining cannot begin [until a] validity exam [was] done”). 47\n\n      On September 29, 2003, Mr. Simonson sent a letter to the Secretary of Interior,\ncomplaining that Reoforce had been “hindered over the years by the Ridgecrest BLM office[.]”\nPX-430.\n\n        On October 14, 2003, the BLM requested preliminary information from Mr. Simonson as\nto Reoforce’s corporate status in order to begin the validity examination process. DX-40 (“Your\ndesire to press forward with a validity exam is suitable and appropriate. The BLM concurs that\nan examination of the validity of these claims is necessary. Documenting Reoforce’s corporate\nstatus is a necessary step in that process.”).\n\n       On November 2003, Kern County approved Reoforce’s SMARA reclamation bond. DX-\n39.\n\n        On November 18, 2003, Mr. Simonson submitted a Reoforce 2002 Mining Operation\nAnnual Report to the BLM stating that the status of the Reoforce mines was “Active” and that\nthe total disturbed acreage of the mines was 1.85 acres. DX-166.\n\n       On February 17, 2004, the Supervisory Geologist at the BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office\nsent an email to another BLM official, James Hamilton, to explain the agency’s “procedural\npolicy” as to prioritization of validity exams for mining claims located in the Withdrawal Area:\n\n       The BLM determined that if a site was active; i.e., on-going mining and milling\n       were taking place on the date the CDPA was passed, we would allow them to\n       continue operating in the same manner until we completed a validity exam of the\n       operation at some future date. Any non-active operation, such as Mr. Simonson’s,\n       would require completing a validity exam before operations were allowed to\n       proceed.\nPX-438.\n\n        In a March 9, 2004 letter to the BLM, Mr. Simonson requested an explanation as to when\nthe validity determination would be made and complained that “[a]s of October 3, 2003, there\nhas been no communication from you regarding the validity exam that you are in charge of for\nmy Reoforce Inc. Mining Claims.” PX-244. On May 26, 2004, Mr. Simonson wrote a follow-up\nto the BLM, because he received no response to his March 9, 2004 letter. PX-247.\n\n\n       47\n          PX-253 (describing a “letter dated August 12, 2003 [reflecting Mr. Simonson’s view]\nthat my approved mining plan by the BLM is presently not valid until the validity exam is\ncompleted”); PX-291 (referencing the August 12, 2003 letter and stating that there “could be no\ndevelopment [at the Reoforce claims] since 1995[,] because I was told in writing I could not\ndisturb any of the property[,] until the validity exam was completed”); DX-108 (referencing the\nAugust 12, 2003 letter and expressing confusion about recent BLM statements that “almost\nimpl[y] I could have continued to mine on my own plan of operation”).\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\f         In a June 7, 2004 letter to the BLM Ridgecrest Office, Mr. Simonson again complained\nthat “[d]ue to the establishing of the Red Rock Canyon Park, my mining claims were put in\njeopardy until a validity examination could be done” and stated that Reoforce was unable to\nfulfill the 1995 purchase orders from A. Schulman because of the August 1995 MOU. PX-248.\n\n        On September 14, 2004, the BLM State Director advised Mr. Simonson that there was no\n“[POO] for the mining claims owned by Reoforce, Inc.,” because Mr. Simonson allowed the\noriginal El Paso mining claims to lapse by failing to pay the requisite statutory fee. PX-334.\nTherefore, Reoforce’s POO “expired by its own terms in 2002.” PX-334.\n\n        On February 22, 2005, Mr. Simonson sent National Gypsum Company a sample of\n“Reoforce pumicite” and a “sedigraph readout for mineral distribution.” PX-264. On May 10,\n2005, Cargill Salt (“Cargill”) sent Mr. Simonson a letter regarding the potential use of “Reoforce\npumicite” as an anticaking or flow agent for salt. PX-271. At that time, Cargill was purchasing\nprecipitated silica from JM Huber to act as a flow agent for salt. 9/16/13 TR 368–69\n(Simonson). The May 10, 2005 letter indicated that Cargill’s preliminary tests showed that\n“Reoforce pumicite” “prevent[ed] caking and enhance[d] flow,” so that the company was\n“prepared to enter the next phase of testing to ensure that [‘Reoforce pumicite’] functions,” and\nthis would entail “analytical testing, additional stability testing, and inspection of [the Reoforce]\nproduction facility.” PX-271. But, Cargill cautioned that FDA approval likely would be\nrequired, since the pumicite would come into contact with food. PX-271.\n\n       On March 1, 2006, Mr. Simonson sent a letter to the BLM asking when the agency would\ncomplete a validity exam of the Reoforce mining claims. PX-291. The letter explained there\nwas no activity on the Reoforce mining claims in or around August 1995, because Mr. Simonson\n“was told in writing [by the BLM that he] could not disturb any of the property until the validity\nexam was completed.” PX-291.\n\n        On March 2, 2006, a BLM geologist in the California Desert District Office sent an email\nto the official in charge of the California division of the BLM in Sacramento to explain that\n\n       [the BLM geologist] would question any lack of activity on the [Reoforce] mining\n       claim[s being] used as a basis for closing [the Reoforce] case, especially since a\n       latch exists because BLM did not allow the operator to occupy the property until a\n       [validity examination] was complete.\nPX-334. 54\n\n\n       54\n           An undated memorandum that appears to have been written in 2006, from the BLM\nCalifornia State Director to the Assistant Director, Minerals, Realty and Resource Protection\nexplained that the BLM “determined that Mr. Simonson’s situation best fit Group Two [of the\nMOU],” as there was “no on-going or continuous mining activities and no producing mine” on\nReoforce’s claims. PX-353. It also reported that “BLM informed Mr. Simonson that before\nmining could commence we would first have to determine if he had established any valid\nexisting rights, and the way to do that would be by completing a validity examination of his\nmining claims.” PX-353.\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f       E.      On March 15, 2006, The Bureau of Land Management Instituted A Contest\n               Proceeding To Determine The Validity Of Plaintiffs’ Unpatented Mining\n               Claims.\n\n        On March 15, 2006, a Supervisory Geologist at BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office sent an\nemail to other BLM employees, explaining that “BLM never rescinded Mr. Simonson’s 1987\nplan of operation” and clarified that, in July of 1995, the BLM “identif[ied to Mr. Simonson] the\nneed to conduct a validity exam of his unpatented mining claims before he could initiate\noperations.” PX-334 (emphasis added).\n        On May 2, 2006, the California Department of Parks and Recreation requested the\nBLM’s advice after “receiv[ing] a letter from Mr. Simonson . . . of his on-going Validity Exam\nand his dilemma to show physical discovery of material.” PX-334. On May 3, 2006, the\nSupervisory Geologist at BLM’s Ridgecrest Field Office replied that, because the BLM’s\nvalidity exam of Reoforce’s claims was ongoing, Mr. Simonson’s request to conduct exploratory\ndrilling appeared to be an “attempt to accomplish discovery after the fact,” since the purpose of\nthe validity exam was to determine whether Reoforce made a discovery of a valuable mineral\nprior to the date the lands within the Withdrawal Area were segregated. PX-334.\n\n       Mr. Simonson is well aware that we cannot and will not permit him to conduct\n       any further work at these claims until the Validity Exam is completed. The result\n       of the Validity Exam will either be an approval for him to go to work, or a\n       Contest action declaring the claims not valid. That decision is totally dependent\n       upon the data gathered during the [2004] field examination of his unpatented\n       mining claims and what exposure of minerals had been made by the date of the\n       field examination.\n\nPX-334 (emphasis added).\n\n       On September 7, 2006, the BLM issued another Mineral Report (“2006 Mineral Report”)\nrecommending that contest proceedings at the Department of the Interior be initiated, because\n“[n]o discovery of a valuable mineral had been made within the limits of [Mr. Simonson’s\nunpatented mining claims].” JX-69. The 2006 Mineral Report also concluded that pumicite was\nexposed on only two of Plaintiffs’ 23 mining claims, there was no open exposure was present on\nthe other 21 claims, and no market for the exposed “Reoforce pumicite.” JX-69. In short, Mr.\nSimonson did not make a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit recognized by the General\nMining Law. JX-69. Consequently, “Reoforce’s activity falls within Group Two [of the August\n1995 MOU].” JX-69.\n\n       F.      The Contest Proceeding And May 12, 2008 Settlement Agreement.\n\n        On February 8, 2007, the BLM initiated a contest proceeding at the Department of\nInterior alleging that Mr. Simonson’s unpatented mining claims were invalid, because: (1) “[n]o\ndiscovery of a valuable mineral has been made within the limits of [El Paso 1A through El Paso\n23A] . . . the pumicite [located therein] was not actually or prospectively marketable from May\n18, 1995, the date of initial segregation through present;” (2) minerals had not been “found or\nexposed” within the limits of twenty-one of Plaintiffs’ unpatented mining claims in “sufficient\nquantities and/or qualities to constitute a valid discovery of a valuable mineral deposit from May\n\n\n                                               32\n\f18, 1995;” and (3) the pumicite located within the limits of El Paso 6A and El Paso 22A was “a\ncommon variety mineral, and not a valuable mineral deposit.” JSF ¶ 24.\n\n      On October 22–26, 2007, November 26–30, 2007, and March 3–5, 2008, the BLM\nconducted hearings to determine the validity of the Reoforce claims. PX-444.\n\n         On May 12, 2008, the BLM and Reoforce entered into a settlement agreement that\nresolved the contest proceeding, required Reoforce to relinquish all rights, title, and interest in\ntwenty (El Paso claims 1A–5A, 8A–21A, and 23A) of the twenty-three challenged unpatented\nmining claims, but allowed Reoforce to proceed under the 1987 plan of operations to mine on El\nPaso 6A, 7A, and 22A, subject to four stipulations (the “Settlement Agreement”). PX-439. Two\nof those stipulations provided that Reoforce would relinquish all rights, title, and interest in the\nremaining three El Paso mining claims, if Reoforce: (1) failed to begin mining within 24 months\nof execution of the 2008 Settlement Agreement; or (2) ceased mining operations for a continuous\nperiod of twelve months. PX-439. A third stipulation provided that Reoforce had the right to\nmine the El Paso claims for an initial term of 20 years from the date of execution of the 2008\nSettlement Agreement, with an option to renew for an additional 20-year period, provided there\nwas “substantial and continuous mining operations during the first 20 years of operation.” PX-\n439. The fourth stipulation provided that the three mining claims were to be treated as a single\nunit for purposes of the third stipulation, so that mining on any individual claim was sufficient to\nsatisfy the “substantial and continuous mining” requirement of the third stipulation. PX-439. On\nMay 19, 2008, the Department of Interior’s Office of Hearings and Appeals dismissed the\ncontest proceedings. JSF ¶ 25.\n\n       G.      Activities Regarding Plaintiffs’ Mining Claims After The May 12, 2008\n               Settlement Agreement.\n\n        On July 10, 2008, Reoforce requested that the BLM approve a Road Use POO for a road\nadjacent to the mining claims to haul pumicite at a rate of 50,000 tons per-year (approximately\n200 tons per-day). PX-327. The Road Use Plan was required to comply with the 1987 Reoforce\nplan of operations. JX-7 (May 28, 1987 letter approving Reoforce’s POO, subject to submitting\na comprehensive road plan).\n         On October 28, 2008, the BLM approved the Road Use POO, explaining that “Reoforce\nis free to move forward with [mining operations],” provided it complied with pertinent statutory\nand regulatory requirements, as well as other stipulations previously-imposed by the BLM. PX-\n330.\n\nIII.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY.\n\n       On December 19, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims alleging that the BLM effected a temporary regulatory taking of the three unpatented\nplacer mining claims recognized as valid property rights in the May 12, 2008 Settlement\nAgreement (“Compl.”).\n       On February 17, 2012, the Government filed a Motion To Dismiss, arguing that the court\ndid not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the December 9, 2011 Complaint,\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fbecause it was filed outside the six-year time period required by 28 U.S.C. § 2501. On March\n19, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Response. On April 5, 2012, the Government filed a Reply.\n        On April 25, 2012, then-presiding Senior Judge Futey denied the Government’s February\n17, 2012 Motion To Dismiss. See Reoforce v. United States, No. 11-884, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1427387</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3\n(Fed.

The\ncourt also determined that Plaintiffs’ claims did not accrue in 1995, “because the [MOU] . . . was\nnot a final governmental determination depriving [Plaintiffs] of a compensable property right.”\nId. at *3 (quoting Navajo Nation v.

Cir. 2011) (“In\ncertain situations, a claim for a temporary regulatory taking does not accrue when a regulation is\nenacted[,] because the regulation itself is not a final governmental determination depriving a\nplaintiff of a compensable property right.”)). Therefore, the court determined that Plaintiffs’\nclaims in this case accrued on September 7, 2006, when the BLM issued the 2006 Mineral\nReport, finding that Plaintiffs never made a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit within the\nsix-year statute of limitations. Id. at *5.\n\n       On May 9, 2012, the Government filed an Answer, asserting six affirmative defenses. 56\n\n        On July 23, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment arguing that,\nas a matter of law, the duration of the Government’s alleged temporary regulatory taking was\nfrom August 7, 1995 to May 12, 2008. On July 30, 2012, the Government also filed a Motion\nFor Partial Summary Judgment, contending that Plaintiffs could pursue a temporary regulatory\ntakings claim only for the period September 7, 2006, i.e., the date that Senior Judge Futey\ndetermined that Plaintiffs’ claims accrued, to May 12, 2008, i.e., when the Settlement Agreement\nwas entered. On August 31, 2012, both parties filed a Response. On September 21, 2012, both\nparties filed a Reply.\n\n        On December 11, 2012, Senior Judge Futey denied both Partial Motions For Summary\nJudgment, determining that Plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because a\nplaintiff can only recover damages from the date commencing when the Government’s taking\nbegins. See Order, Reoforce v. United States, ECF No. 11-884, Dkt. 27 at 6–8 (Fed. Cl. Dec. 11,\n2012) (“Reoforce II”). The Government’s Motion For Partial Summary Judgment also was\ndenied, because issues of material fact remained as to “whether plaintiffs can establish a taking\nby extraordinary delay, and if so, the date such delay became extraordinary, prior to September\n7, 2006.” Reoforce II, at 10. In so ruling, Senior Judge Futey determined that the valid existing\nrights determination was the functional equivalent of a permitting process. Id. at 6–10.\n\n       56\n          Those affirmative defenses were: (1) the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted; (2) that the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate “in whole or in part the\nsubject matter of this action;” (3) the claims alleged are barred by the applicable statute of\nlimitations; (4) the Complaint fails to allege an action undertaken by the Government that was\nripe for adjudication; (5) Plaintiffs’ lacked standing; and (6) Plaintiffs’ lacked a “compensable\nproperty interest to pursue this claim.” Answer at 5.\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\f        On November 14, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment On\nUnited States’ Sixth Affirmative Defense, arguing that the doctrines of equitable estoppel and res\njudicata precluded the Government from arguing that Plaintiffs’ lacked a compensable property\ninterest in the three unpatented mining claims. On December 17, 2012, the Government filed a\nResponse. On January 14, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Reply. On April 4, 2013, Senior Judge Futey\ngranted Plaintiffs’ November 14, 2012 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment regarding the\nGovernment’s sixth affirmative defense. See Reoforce v.

Therein,\nPlaintiffs contend that Senior Judge Futey erroneously construed the December 19, 2011\nComplaint as solely asserting a temporary regulatory taking claim stemming from the BLM’s\nalleged extraordinary delay in the valid existing rights determination process and equating the\ncontest proceedings to a permitting scheme. On January 25, 2013, the Government filed a\nResponse, agreeing with Plaintiffs that the contest proceedings were not analogous to a\npermitting process, but that the “concessions in [the] Motion [F]or Reconsideration require that\n[Plaintiffs] claim be dismissed as time barred.” Dkt. 35 at 2. On February 7, 2013, Senior Judge\nFutey granted Plaintiffs’ January 8, 2013 Motion For Reconsideration and determined that the\nGovernment’s alleged taking may have occurred before Plaintiffs’ claims accrued, so that\ncompensation should be measured from the time of the Government’s initial interference with\nPlaintiffs’ property rights, instead of when the claims accrued. See Order, Reoforce v. United\nStates, No. 11-884, Dkt. 37 at 2 (Fed. Cl. Feb. 7, 2013) (“Reoforce IV”) In addition, although\nPlaintiffs’ claims may not have accrued until the contest proceedings were complete, “the\ninterference that effects a taking might begin much earlier, and compensation is measured from\nthat time.” Id.

And, the BLM was clear that a validity determination would need to be conducted for\nall affected property before any transfer. JX-34 (MOU). Therefore, for a compensable property\nright to accrue on August 7, 1995, the BLM would have needed to commence and complete a\nvalidity determination on that date. See Navajo Nation, 631 F.3d at 1278 (recognizing that a\ntakings claim does not accrue unless “the regulation itself is . . . a final governmental\ndetermination depriving a plaintiff of a compensable property right); see also Vane Minerals\n(US), LLC v.

PX-439 (“This Agreement . . . fully resolves Mineral\nContest CACA 48717.”). Likewise, Plaintiffs’ takings claim was not ripe until May 12, 2008,\nbecause that was the final date of BLM action.

In this case, the BLM\ndid not make a validity determination until the May 12, 2008 Settlement.\n\n        For this reason, the court has determined that Plaintiffs did not have standing to seek an\nadjudication of a takings claim until May 12, 2008. Plaintiffs, however, did not file suit on that\ndate, but waited until December 19, 2011.\n\n\n                                                  38\n\f        The May 12, 2008 Settlement Agreement between Plaintiffs and the BLM, however,\nspecifically provides:\n\n       Reoforce can proceed under its approved [POO] to mine the El Paso 6A, El Paso\n       7A, and El Paso 22A placer mining claims, subject to the following conditions:\n\n       (a) Reoforce shall begin mining within 24 months of execution of this settlement\n       agreement. If mining does not begin within 24 months, this agreement shall\n       terminate and Reoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title and interest in El\n       Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El Paso 22A unpatented mining claims.\n\n       (b) If Reoforce ceases mining operations for any continuous period of 12 months,\n       this agreement shall terminate and Reoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title\n       and interest in El Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El Paso 22A unpatented mining\n       claims.\n\nPX-439 (emphasis added).\n\n       Neither Mr. Simonson’s trial testimony (TR 32–541) nor any other evidence establishes\nthat Plaintiffs began mining within 24 months, as required by the May 12, 2008 Settlement\nAgreement. Indeed, on October 28, 2008, after the BLM approved Reoforce’s Road Use POO\nthere were no federal or state regulatory impediments to Plaintiffs engaging in mining activities.\nPX 330. But, there is no evidence in the record that any “mining” took place on the El Paso 6A,\nEl Paso 7A, or El Paso 22A claims, either after May 12, 2008 Settlement or after BLM’s October\n28, 2008 approval of Reoforce’s Road Use POO.\n\n        As a matter of law, a plaintiff initially must plead some injury to have standing and the\ncourt must accept those allegations as true when making a standing determination. See\nPennell v. City of San Jose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112009\"><a href=\"/opinion/112009/pennell-v-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1988) (“[W]hen standing is challenged on the basis of\nthe pleadings, we ‘accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and . . . construe the\ncomplaint in favor of the complaining party[.]’”) (citation omitted). But, after trial, a plaintiff’s\nobligation to establish standing is subject to a more stringent standard, particularly where the\ncause of action arises from the United States Constitution. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (holding\nthat the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the requisite elements\nand that “each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the\nplaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the\nsuccessive stages of the litigation”) (emphasis added). To require that a plaintiff have title to\nproperty at the time a suit is filed or forgo the ability to obtain an adjudication of a takings claim\nmay be viewed as harsh. But here, where Plaintiffs voluntarily relinquished all property rights,\nstanding has been compromised. PX-439 (“If mining does not begin within 24 months, . . .\nReoforce shall relinquish all of its rights, title, and interest in El Paso 6A, El Paso 7A, and El\nPaso 22A unpatented mining claims.”).\n\n        Therefore, in the court’s judgment, this case should be dismissed on standing grounds,\nalbeit not suggested by the Government. In any event, as discussed herein, even assuming,\narguendo, that Plaintiffs have standing, the record does not establish that the August 7, 1995\nMOU effected a taking that warrants compensation.\n\n\n\n                                                 39\n\f       C.

Cir. 2003)\n(discussing whether governmental action “constitutes a compensable taking for a public\npurpose”).\n\n               1.     Whether Plaintiffs Had A Compensable Property Right On August 7,\n                      1995, When The Department Of The Interior Entered Into The\n                      Memorandum Of Understanding With The State Of California.\n\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a plaintiff also\nmust have a “valid property interest at the time of the taking[.]” See Am. Pelagic Fishing, 379\nF.3d at 1372 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs’ property interest did not vest until the May 12, 2008\nSettlement Agreement. Therefore, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs did not have a compensable\nproperty interest for purposes of the Fifth Amendment on August 7, 1995, the date the MOU\nbecame effective. As such, the court’s “task is at an end.” Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., 379 F.3d at\n1372. Nevertheless, the court will complete the two-part analysis established in Karuk Tribe.\n\n               2.     Assuming, Arguendo, That Plaintiffs Had A Compensable Property\n                      Right On August 7, 1995, Whether The Character Of The\n                      Memorandum Of Understanding Effected A Taking.\n\n        Assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs had compensable property right on August 7, 1995,\nthe MOU had no binding legal effect on that date, because validity determinations remained to\nbe conducted on all unpatented mining claims. JX-34; see also Goodrich v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"211517\"><a href=\"/opinion/211517/john-b-goodrich-doing-business-as-checkerboard-cattle-co-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (explaining that for a taking to occur, the government action\nmust be analogous to “final agency action.”). Of course, Plaintiffs assert that “the BLM’s actual\ntreatment of the Reoforce claims” evidences that the August 7, 1995 MOU did “alter existing\nrights or regulations.” Pl. Reply 4. But, what Plaintiffs thought the legal effect of the August 7,\n1995 MOU was, does not establish a legal obligation.\n\n        There are several dispositive pieces of evidence substantiating that the August 7, 1995\nMOU did not effect or suspend Plaintiff’s May 28, 1987 approved POO. First, the BLM\nspecifically informed Mr. Simonson on July 12, 1995 that “[f]or operations such as yours, you\nwill be allowed to continue in accordance with your approved mining [POO] while the validity\nexam process i[s] completed for your claims.” DX-19 (emphasis added). Second, after the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU, Plaintiffs entered into a joint venture (JX-40); obtained a diesel permit for\noperation (PX-144); drilled exploratory holes on the claims (DX-156); continued to market\n“Reoforce pumicite” (PX-33; PX-161; DX-183); and filed an application to comply with\n\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fSMARA (DX-132). As such, the evidence belies Plaintiffs’ contention that Reoforce was\nprohibited from mining by the MOU as of August 7, 1995.\n\n          For these reasons, the court has determined that the August 7, 1995 MOU did not effect a\ntaking.\n\n          D.     Assuming, Arguendo, That The August 7, 1995 Memorandum Of\n                 Understanding Effected A Taking Of Plaintiffs’ Mining Rights,\n                 Compensation Is Not Warranted.\n\n        Assuming, arguendo, that the August 7, 1995 MOU effected a taking of Plaintiffs’\nmining claims, it is well established that not every government action that reduces a property’s\nvalue is a regulatory taking, but some regulations can be so severe that the Fifth Amendment\nrequires payment of compensation. Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of N.Y., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109924\"><a href=\"/opinion/109924/penn-central-transp-co-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136\n(1978) (holding that courts “must consider whether the interference with [Plaintiffs’] property is\nof such a magnitude that there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to\nsustain [it].”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[W]hether a particular restriction\nwill be rendered invalid by the government’s failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by\nit depends largely ‘upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.’” Id. This analysis is ad hoc\nand fact-specific. The United States Supreme Court has identified three factors that a trial court\nmust consider the: (1) “economic impact of the regulation on the claimant”; (2) “extent to which\nthe regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations”; and (3) “character of\nthe governmental action.” Cienega Gardens v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782265\"><a href=\"/opinion/782265/cienega-gardens-claremont-village-commons-covina-west-apartments-del-amo/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1337 (Fed. Cir.\n2003). The intent of Penn Central is “to ensure that not every restraint imposed by government\nto adjust the competing demands of private owners [will] result in a takings claim.” Id. at 1340\n(quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Not surprisingly, the parties have a different perspective of the economic impact of the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU: the Government asserts that the economic impact at best was $107,000;\nPlaintiffs insist they suffered $46.5 million in economic harm. Compare Gov’t Br. 62 with PX-\n443. The record, however, establishes that despite repeated efforts, Plaintiffs failed to achieve\nmarket acceptance of “Reoforce pumicite” prior to the issuance of the August 7, 1995 MOU.\nDX-12; DX-205; DX-180. In fact, after Plaintiffs obtained the May 28, 1987 POO until the\nAugust 7, 1995 MOU was enacted, only two sales of “Reoforce pumicite” were made. 9/17/13\nTR 429–31 (Simonson). At best, Plaintiffs were several years away from commercial-scale\nmining on August 7, 1995. 9/19/13 TR 1130 (Springer) (Reoforce had not completed an\nadequate exploratory drill program in August 1995); 9/19/13 TR 1131 (Springer) (as of August\n1995, Reoforce did not have SMARA approval); 9/19/13 TR 1136 (Springer) (as of August\n1995, Reoforce did not comply with Federal Mine Safety Health Administration’s regulatory\nrequirements); 9/19/13 TR 1139 (Springer) (all of these actions “made it difficult if not\nimpossible for Reoforce to secure the funding or financial partners necessary to develop\ncommercial-scale mining”). Other trial testimony estimated that, on August 7, 1995, Plaintiffs\nstill were at least four to eight years away from commercial viability. 9/20/13 TR 1167\n(Springer). As such, Plaintiffs incurred no economic harm caused by the August 7, 1995 MOU\nor any other BLM action.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\f        As for Plaintiffs’ “investment-backed expectations,” the barriers to entry into a\ncommodity market were substantial and commercial viability “highly speculative.” DX-120, at\n13–17 (Dr. Frahme); 9/20/13 TR 1184–1202 (Dr. Frahme). In addition, the record is replete with\nevidence of Mr. Simonson sending numerous samples of the “Reoforce pumicite” to academic\nand corporate entities to ascertain whether this mineral had any commercial use or market value.\nPX-7, PX-16, PX-26, PX-29, PX-31, PX-32, PX-34, PX-37, PX-38, PX-39, PX-41, PX-42; PX-\n55, PX-56, PX-67, PX-68, PX-70, PX-76, PX-96, PX-103, PX-109, PX-111, PX-128, PX-264,\nPX-271, PX-436, DX-69, DX-74, DX-94. Although there was some indication of potential\ncommercial use, no one advised Plaintiffs that “Reoforce pumicite” was “of such a character that\n‘a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and\nmeans, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.’”\nChrisman v.

As such, Plaintiffs failed to establish that the August 7, 1995 MOU\ninterfered with reasonable “investment-based expectations.”\n\n        Finally, The United States Supreme Court has held that in ascertaining whether\ncompensation is warranted, the courts should determine whether the government action at issue\n“merely affects property interests through ‘some public program adjusting the benefits and\nburdens of economic life to promote the common good.’” Lingle v.

See 43 U.S.C. § 1701. The\npurpose of the August 7, 1995 MOU was to manage and administer federal land located within\nthe Red Rock Canyon State Park, primarily to insure compliance with federal mining laws and\nNEPA, which benefits the public at large. JX-43 at IIIA(1). Plaintiffs counter that the August 7,\n1995 MOU “was not a nationwide change in mining regulations applicable to everyone. It only\napplied to those few within the proposed addition to the Red Rock Canyon State Park.” Pl. Br.\n38. As such, Plaintiffs contend that they bore the full economic impact of this regulatory\nactivity. But, Plaintiffs provide no authority for the proposition that a regulation issued on a less-\nthan-nationwide basis equates to “targeting.” Without evidence that the BLM went out of its\nway to impose regulations on Plaintiffs alone, without a legitimate reason, the court must assume\nthat the BLM acted in good faith.
