WOODALL, JUDGE\n\f                                   OPINION\n       The appellan ts, Jame s Mon tgomery and Tony Carruthers, were each indicted,\n\nalong with their co-defendant, Jonathan Montgomery, on three counts of the\n\npremeditated first degree mu rders of Ma rcellos Ande rson, h is mo ther, D elois\n\nAnderson, and Frederick Tucker. Prior to trial, Jonathan Montgomery was found\n\nhanged in his jail cell. James Mo ntgome ry and Ton y Carruthers were also indicted\n\non three counts e ach of the esp ecially aggravated kidnapping of all three victims,\n\nand one count each of the especially aggravated robbery of Marcellos Anderson.\n\nThe appellants w ere tried and co nvicted on ea ch charge . The appe llants were\n\nsentenced to death by electrocution for the three murder convictions and received\n\nforty year sentences for each of the other offenses. The jury found the existence\n\nof four aggravating circumstances as to each appellant for each murder conviction:\n\n1) the mu rder wa s espe cially heino us, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture;\n\n2) the appellants co mmitted m ass murd er; 3) the appellan ts had previously been\n\nconvicted of one or more violent felonies; and 4) the murders were committed during\n\nthe perpe tration o f espe cially aggravated kidnapping and especially aggravated\n\nrobbery. T.C.A. § 39-13-20 4(i)(2), (5), (7), and (12). On appeal, the appellants raise\n\nthe following issues concerning alleged errors occurring before trial as well as during\n\nboth p hase s of the trial:\n\n\n\n                                 Appellant Carru thers\n\n       Whether appellant was denied his right to due process by h aving to\n       represe nt himse lf;\n\n       Whe ther ap pellan t was d enied the effe ctive a ssista nce o f coun sel;\n\n       Whether the state should have been required to elect on which\n       indictment it was proceeding;\n\n       Whethe r the grand jury pro ceedings w ere proper;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay and irrelevant\n       evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court should have ordered a competency evaluation\n       of a prosecution witness;\n\n       Whether the co urt erro neou sly adm itted vid eotap e and photo graph ic\n       evidence;\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      Whether appellant was denied his right to be present at sentencing for\n      the especially aggravated kidnapping convictions;\n\n      Whe ther the p rosecu tor enga ged in im proper a rgume nt;\n\n      Whethe r the trial court erred in issuing a gag order;\n\n       Whether the death penalty statute is unconstitutional; and\n\n       Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.\n\n\n\n                                Appellant Mo ntgomery\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in denying appellant’s motion for\n       severance;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence;\n\n       Whe ther the p rosecu tor enga ged in im proper a rgume nt;\n\n       Whe ther prior cons istent state ments were im properly introduce d into\n       evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in admitting photographic evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the victims\n       taken while they were alive;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of alternative\n       perpetrators;\n\n       Whether the trial court improperly admitted opinion testimony;\n\n       Whether the trial court properly instructed the jury;\n\n       Whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdicts;\n\n       Whe ther the death pena lty statu te is un cons titutiona l.\n\n\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the 82 volume record in light of the issues raised by\n\nboth appellants in their separate briefs, and finding no errors requiring reversal of\n\neither the c onviction s or sente nces, w e affirm the judgm ent of the tria l court.\n\n\n\n                                        HISTORY\n\n       In order to put the proce dural h istory o f this case in proper perspective for the\n\nissues raised, we will first outline the events leading up to trial and will then discuss\n\nthe evidence introduced at trial. The appellants were indicted for first degree murder\n\nin March 1994. The Office of the Public Defender was appointed to represent\n\nMontgomery. Carruthers initially retained an attorney, A.C. W harton, who was\n\nsubs eque ntly allowed to withdraw because of a poten tial conflict of inte rest. Nothing\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fin the rec ord su gges ts this conflict was created by the co nduct o f Carruth ers. At a\n\nhearing on April 27, 1994, the trial court mentioned that Carruthers informed the\n\ncourt he wanted some input as to which attorney would be appointed to his case.\n\nIn a sub sequ ent he aring o n Ma y 18, 1 994, C arruth ers ind icated that his family ’s\n\nattempt to retain cou nsel failed. H e aske d the cou rt to appo int cou nsel so he co uld\n\nstart filing mo tions.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers, who eventually represented himself at trial, was appointed a\n\nnumber of attorneys throughout the two years leading up to the trial in this case.\n\nAlthough we go into more detail below, for the sake of reference we will list in order\n\nall the attorneys who were appointed and allowed to withdraw: Larry Nance\n\n(appointed May 1994 - withdrawn December 1994); Craig Morton (appointed August\n\n1994 - withdrawn July 1995 ); Coleman Garrett (appointed December 1994 -\n\nwithdrawn July 1995); W illiam Masse y (appointed J uly 1995 - w ithdrawn Jan uary\n\n1996); Harry Sayle (appo inted J uly 1995 - withdrawn February 1 996). The trial court\n\nalso appoin ted at differe nt times tw o attorne ys, Jam es Turn er and G lenn W right, to\n\nassist in the inve stigation o f the case , but both were subs equen tly allowed to\n\nwithd raw a s well.\n\n\n\n       On May 31, 1 994, after Carru thers informed the court that he had no success\n\nin hiring another lawyer, the trial court appointed Larry N ance. On July 8, 1994, the\n\nstate filed its notice to seek the death penalty against both appellants for each\n\nmurder charge. In a hearing on July 15, 1994, the trial court scheduled a hearing on\n\npretrial motion s for Sep tembe r 30, 199 4, and se t the trial date for February 20, 1995.\n\nCarruthers was present at the hearing and asked the trial court “why this is being\n\ndragged out like this. I asked Mr. N ance if w e can go forward with a motion of\n\ndiscovery and he’s asking for a reset. And I’d like to know why.” Nance informed\n\nthe court that he was going to visit the prosecutor’s office later in the week to review\n\ntheir evidence. The trial court stated:\n\n\n\n       Court: This is a complex case. We have several lawyers who have a\n       lot of work to do on this case and a lot of work to do on other cases that\n       they’re handling --\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      Carruthers: Y eah, Your H onor, but --\n\n      Court: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\n              And we’ve got a trial date now as early as possible. A three-\n      defendant capital murder case requires at least a week, probably two,\n      to try an d so w e can ’t set it this fa ll beca use th is fall is alre ady fu ll.\n              We’ve already go t cases set for trial every week between now\n      and January. And Mr. Stein [counsel for Montgomery] has cases set\n      throughout Janu ary. So the ea rliest po ssible date, th e earlie st pos sible\n      date, that we can try a three-defendant capital murder case is in\n      February. That’s the best we can do.\n              We’ve got a lot of other cases . There are a lo t of othe r peop le\n      sitting back the re waiting for their trials that have been waiting longer\n      than you have.\n              And so given the fact that the trial isn’t until February, we’re\n      setting the next Court date in September for the arguing of motions.\n      Between now and September, your attorney and the attorneys\n      representing your two co-defendants can get with the prosecutors and\n      can obtain their discovery.\n              They’re all excellent attorneys. And they’ll all do that. And once\n      they’ve obtained the discov ery, the y’ll mee t with th eir clien ts and they’ll\n      file appropriate motions, which will be heard on September 30th, which\n      will still be well in advance of the trial date, which will give everyone\n      amp le time to then evaluate the case, after the motions have been\n      heard and ruled on.\n              So given the fact that w e can ’t get a three-defendant capital case\n      that’s still in the arraignment stage to trial any earlier than February,\n      there’s plenty of time for your attorneys to meet with the prosecutors,\n      get the discovery, meet with the clients, file motions, argue motions.\n              Just because he hadn’t done it yeste rday, b ecau se yo u wan t him\n      to have it done yesterday, doesn’t mean that he’s not working on your\n      case diligen tly and prope rly. He’ll h ave e veryth ing do ne we ll in\n      advance of the next Court date.\n              And so, you know, he may not do it the very moment you want\n      it done, b ut you’re going to have to work with him on that because\n      there’s ample time for him to get it done.\n\n      Carruthers: I talked to him over forty-five days ago [approximately the\n      time Nance was appointed] and asked him to talk to the medical\n      examiner abou t getting the tim e of de ath an d auto psy. H e had n’t did\n      that yet.\n\n      Court: Well, that’s fine.\n\n      Carruthers: And that’s forty-five days.\n\n      Court: T hat’s fine. S tep out.\n\n\n      The record reflects that Nance filed numerous pretrial motions, including\n\nreques ts for discovery, investigative services and a menta l exam ination. On August\n\n12, 1994 , Craig Morto n was appo inted a s co-c ouns el for Carruthers. The rec ord\n\nreflects that Mo rton started filing a litany of m otions after his appointment. These\n\nincluded motions in limine to exclude certain evidence, e.g., letters Carruthers\n\nmailed to Jim my M aze, a motio n for ind ividua l voir dire, motions for various\n\ndiscovery reques ts, a motion for impeachment evidence, a motion for competency\n\nevaluation of prosecution witnesses, motion for another mental evaluation of\n\n                                              5\n\fCarruthers, motions to dismiss the indictments, motion to suppress statement of co-\n\ndefendant Jonathan M ontgom ery, motions for s everance , a motion for exp ert\n\nservices , and a no tice of an a libi defense .\n\n\n\n       In a hearing on September 30, 1994, the trial court continued the motion\n\nhearing date u ntil Nove mbe r 18, 19 94. Th e cou rt stated that it wo uld consider any\n\nmotion filed by either appellant to apply to both, if applicable. The trial judge also\n\nmentioned that he had re ceived “an abu ndanc e of corre spond ence” fro m both\n\nappellan ts expressing c oncern about the pretrial performance of counsel. The court\n\nallowed coun sel to make statements on the record in response to these letters.\n\nInitially, Nance stated that the defense had almost obtained complete discovery from\n\nthe state. He further stated that he could not say ho w ma ny of the 1 00 state\n\nwitnesses (which included everyone remotely related to this case including all of the\n\npolice officers and state employees) he had interviewed, but that he had alr eady\n\nissued subpoenas for about eight of those witnesses. Nance indicated that he had\n\nmet with Ca rruthers tw o sepa rate occa sions for a n exten ded pe riod of time to\n\ndiscuss his case. He had also met Carruthers’ family to discuss matters. Nance\n\nadmitted there was quite a bit more work yet to be done, such as obtaining the\n\nservices of an investigator, an d stated that he h ad spent ap proximately 2 5 hours\n\nwork ing on the case up to that time, including discussions with co-counsel about\n\ndefense strategy. Nance also informed the court that there was “some enm ity that’s\n\ndeveloped betwe en he a nd I,” but that counsel had hoped it could be worked out.\n\n\n\n       The court also allowed Ca rruthers to tell his side of the story . Carruthers\n\ndisputed counsel’s recollection of the visits and informed the court that he had filed\n\na complaint with the Board of Professional Responsibility against Nance. He also\n\nstated that counsel ha s shown no “eagern ess” in this case a nd that he did n ot “fear”\n\ncounse l.   Carruth ers’ ma in com plaint see med to be a lack of face-to-fa ce\n\ncommunications. The court acknowledged the appellants’ concerns given what they\n\nfaced, but told them tha t many as pects of the attorne y-client relationship did not\n\ninvolve personal contact. The court stated that the representation up to that point\n\nas he saw it was well w ithin the proper standards: the appropriate motions had been\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\ffiled, discovery had been sought, and conferences had been held. The fact that the\n\nappe llants m ay no t like the ir attorney s, accord ing to the tria l court, had no bearing\n\non counsel’s performance.\n\n\n\n       On October 21, 1994, the trial court authorized payment for investigative\n\nservices (Arthur R. Anderson) for Carruthers. Morton informed the court, howev er,\n\nthat the investigator tried to talk to Carruthers on two sep arate occa sions at the ja il\n\nbut was told Carruthers refused to see him. Also at the hearing on the 21st, the\n\nprosecutor informed the court that he had provided all the disc overy he had at that\n\npoint; he wa s still waiting o n a ballistic report. In addition, the court authorized\n\ncomp etency evaluations for each appellant. In a hearing before the trial court on\n\nNovember 18, 1994, Morton requested permission to hire a new investigator\n\nbecause he felt the one they had, Arthur Anderson, was not taking an aggressive\n\nenough role in the matter. The court continued the hearing date on pretrial motions\n\nuntil December 16, 1994.         Morton informed the court in another hearing on\n\nNovember 23, 1994, that they had secured the services of Premier Investigations.\n\n\n\n       Throughout Nance and Morton’s representation, Carruthers filed various pro\n\nse motions on his own be half. Along with a m otion fo r subs titution o f coun sel,\n\nCarruthers filed motions similar to those filed by counsel, as well as those filed by\n\nhis co-defendant, James Montgomery. In fact, many of these pro se filings are\n\nidentical to those filed by Montgomery pro se. On Decem ber 9, 1994, Larry Nance\n\nwas allowed to withdraw as counsel. The record does not contain a copy of the\n\nmotion or transcript of a hear ing, if there w as one . Colem an Ga rrett was appointed\n\nas co-counsel that same day.          Thereafter, counsel continued to file motions,\n\nincluding motions to continue the trial date . Carruthers also continued filing pro se\n\npleadings.    Similarly, Morton filed several motions prepared by Carruthers,\n\nappa rently at Carruthers’ insistence. On December 16, 1994, the court heard most\n\nof the motions filed by counsel, and continued hearing on those involving an\n\nevidentiary hearing until Janu ary 30, 1 995.       It should be noted that since the\n\nbeginning of this ca se, M ontgo mery also vo iced n ume rous c omp laints a bout h is\n\ncoun sel.    In fact, counsel was allowed to withdraw from M ontgo mery ’s\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\frepresentation as well. There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest that\n\nMon tgom ery’s c ondu ct was as eg regiou s as C arruth ers’.\n\n\n\n      Garrett and Morton appeared at the motion hearing on January 30, 1995, and\n\npresented argument on over seventeen motions, including joining the motions filed\n\nby the code fendan t. These motions addressed suppression and discovery issues,\n\nre-evaluation of Carruthers, co mpeten cy of state witnes ses, severan ce, expert\n\nservices, and courtroom security. Also at the hearing, the trial court continued the\n\ntrial date until September 5, 1995.\n\n\n\n      On May 1, 19 95, Garrett and Morton inform ed the court they had been having\n\ndifficulty finding a willing investigator because of the nature of the case and the pay\n\n(the court ad opted a paym ent scheme whereby th e inve stigato r wou ld be p aid\n\n$1,000 and must file an accounting of services and the court would then decide later\n\nif additional funding was appropriate; the court set the hourly rate the same as for\n\nthe attorney s, but app arently the investiga tors wer e dem anding more). G arrett\n\nsecured an investigator to appear at the hearing, but when the court announced the\n\namount of compensation granted for her services, she informed counsel she was\n\nunab le to take the case. The court decided that since coun sel wa s hav ing trou ble\n\nfinding an investigator, the c ourt would appoint a third attorney (James Turner) , to\n\nbe paid at the sam e rate as cou nsel, to serve as appellant’s investiga tor. Carruthers\n\nobjected to this alternative, stating that attorneys cannot obtain the same information\n\nas a certified investigator. The court stated that Carru thers’ o bjectio n was not we ll\n\nfounded. Coun sel also a ddress ed sev eral pretrial m otions, inclu ding a m otion to\n\ndismiss indictments (Alfredo Shaw testified before the grand ju ry, but the s tate\n\ninformed the court that it was not going to use Alfredo Shaw’s statements at trial\n\nbecause the state had since considered him to be unreliable), a motion to sever, and\n\na motio n for ex pert se rvices to ana lyze an audio tape o f Nake ita Mo ntgom ery’s\n\nstatem ent.\n\n\n\n      On May 5, 19 95, Attorney James Turner appeared before the court and\n\nstated, due to the number of witnesses Carruthers named and the amoun t of work\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\finvolved in the ca se, he did no t believ e, as a solo p ractition er, that h e cou ld\n\neffectiv ely perfor m inv estiga tion to a ssist co unse l. The c ourt sta ted tha t it would\n\ncontinue to locate an attorney/investigator. Attorney Glenn Wright was subsequently\n\nappointed to ass ist Mo rton an d Ga rrett in investigating the case. On June 2, 1995,\n\nGarrett argue d the a ppella nt’s m otion to dism iss indic tmen ts due to Sha w’s alle gedly\n\nfalse testimony before the grand jury.\n\n\n\n       Morton and Garrett eventually filed a motion to withdraw. The record re flects\n\nthat Carruthers also filed a motion for substitution of counsel. The trial court granted\n\nboth requests and in a hearing on July 27, 1995, the court appointed William Massey\n\nand Harry Sayle to represent Carruthers. During this hearing, the trial judge made\n\nthe following comments:\n\n\n\n               All right. I understand that these three defendants are on trial for\n       their lives and that these are the most serious of charges and that they\n       are all concerned that they are we ll repres ented and p roper ly\n       represented, and it’s every one’s desire to see to it that th ey are well\n       represented and p roper ly represented . And toward that end, efforts are\n       being made that they are represented by attorneys that have enough\n       experience to handle this type of case and by attorneys that can\n       establish a rapport with their clients that would allow them to represent\n       their clie nts as well.\n               We have gone through several attorneys n ow in an effort to\n       accommodate the defendants’ requests in that regard; but at some\n       point -- and in m y opinion , each of the attorneys and each of the\n       investigators that has represented these defendants that has been\n       relieved have been eminently qualified to do the jo b, but I have allowed\n       them to be relieved for one rea son or ano ther.\n               I want the record to be perfectly clear at this point because of\n       some suggestions that have already been raised by some of the\n       correspondence that I have received from M r. Carruth ers; and all of it,\n       by the way, will be made a part of the record. But Mr. Carruthers has\n       suggested, in his correspondence, that some of the previous attorneys\n       have been relieved because they weren’t capable or competent to do\n       the job. And this is, in my opinion, at least -- my humble opinion as the\n       judge in this ca se -- ab solutely and totally an inacc urate sta temen t.\n       The attorne ys tha t have been relieve d thus far hav e bee n fully ca pable\n       and fully competen t and had be en doing an outstanding job ; but for a\n       variety of reasons, I’ve allowed them to withdraw from the case.\n               Obv iously Mr. Carruthers can say anything he wants. It’s a free\n       country. He can write letters to the Commercial Appeal or the\n       President of the United States and say whatever it is he wants to say.\n       But the point is that I want the record to reflect, each step of the way,\n       so that if he is conv icted, a nd if so if he raises these sorts of questions\n       three years or five years or ten years down the road, the record is\n       perfec tly clear that these attorneys were not relieved because they\n       were not doing an ade quate job. They were not relieved because Mr.\n       Carruthers was not well represented and left in an untenable position\n       because he ha d ineffe ctive a ssista nce o f coun sel pre trial. Tha t is\n       absolutely not the case in my opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f        Mr. Carruthers has raised, through his correspondence, and\nappa rently through direct communication with his previous attorneys,\ncertain matters that are pretty outrageous suggestions; but because of\nthe nature of the matters that he’s raised, the attorneys that\nrepresented him previously felt that an irreparable breach had occurred\nbetween their ability -- between Mr. Carruthe rs and them selves --\neffecting their ability to continue to represent them. And at some point\n-- and that could well have been the point, but it wasn’t. But at some\npoint these ma tters that are raised by the defendants cannot continue\nto be used to get new counsel because it gets to be a point where\nthey’re -- it’s already well beyond the point, but, obviously, at some\npoint, gets to the point where they’re manipulating the system and\ngetting what they want -- Mr. Carruthers, sit still, plea se, or y ou ca n sit\nback there. -- gets to the point where they’re manipulating the system\nand getting trial dates and representation that they want and are calling\nthe shots. That’s another matter that’s bee n raised by M r. Carruthers\nin some of his correspondence; that he w ants his a ttorneys to know that\nhe’s the man c alling the sh ots in this ca se, and he’s the m an to look to.\n        Well, of course , again, it’s a fre e coun try, and he can say\nwhatever he wants, and he can think whatever he wants; but as far as\nI’m concerned -- and this applies to all three defendants and any\ndefend ants that come through this court that are represented by\ncounsel -- and this gets back to what Mr. McLin alluded to earlier -- the\nattorneys are calling the shots in this case. They are trying the case\nexcept for certain areas where the defendant has the exclusive and\nfinal say, such as whether he wants to testify or not and that sort of\nthing. The attorney s are in here representing these clients and will do\nso to the best of their ability. They are the ones who have been to law\nscho ol. They are the ones that have been through trial many times\nbefore, and they’re the o nes that are he re for a reason, and that reason\nis to represent these individuals. And, so, you know, if there’s a conflict\nbetween the attorney and client with regard to how to proceed in the\ncase, you all resolve it as be st you ca n, but ultim ately th e attorn ey is\ntrying the case. And, yo u know , we don ’t pull peop le off the sidew alk\nto try these cases; and th e reas on we don’t is because of certain things\nthat they need to learn and certain experiences they need to have\nprofes siona lly before they’re prepared to try these ca ses. So they ’re\nhere for th at reaso n and fo r that purp ose. . . .\n...\n        So that gets me to the reason for our being here. Because of the\nmatters raised by Mr. Carruthers, I have granted th e requ est of h is\nprevious two attorneys and investigato r reluctantly because, in my\nopinion, they were doing an outstanding job of representing Mr.\nCarruthers and his interests.\n        Mr. Carruthers, if you want to laugh through this proceeding,\nthen, again, I’m going to allow y ou to s it back in the ba ck. If you can sit\nhere and listen to what goes on and communicate with your new\nattorney, that’s fine. You have every right to do that. But if you\ncontinue tossin g you r pen in the air and laughing every fifteen seconds,\nthen it’s fine if you sit back in the back, and your attorney can\ncomm unicate with you back there. So it’s up to y ou. I m ean it d oesn ’t\nmake any difference to me. We can have this hearing with you, or we\ncan have it w ithout you . And it’s com pletely your decision, but if you\ncontinue to act in that wa y, I don’t plan to condu ct this busin ess with\nyou back there laughing and that sort of thing. You can put your hand\ndown, and you can talk to your attorney, and he can address me if he\nthinks it’s appropriate . If he thin ks it’s ina pprop riate, the n he d oesn ’t\nhave to, and you’ll have an opp ortunity to address him and talk to your\nattorney in just a minute -- as soon as I’m through making these\nstatements for the record.\n        And, so, again, if -- you know, if you contin ue with this, an d this\nis going to be true for every hearing that we have -- pretrial and during\nthe trial itself -- if you all wa nt to -- if you want to act that way -- if you\nwant to make faces, toss pen s in the air, waive your h and, la ugh, th at’s\n\n                                      10\n\f      fine. You can sit back there and do that, and that’s fine. If you wa nt to\n      sit and listen intently because this is a serious matter to everybody\n      concerned, that’s fin e. It’s your choice. It doesn’t make any difference\n      to me. B ut you mak e the d ecisio n, and I’ll -- and if you persist in acting\n      this way, you can sit back there, and your attorney can convey to you\n      wha t’s going on in court. If you want to sit and act responsibly out here,\n      you can do so, and you can participate in the trial. Now, whe re were\n      we?\n             Because of the most recent rash of allegations raised by Mr.\n      Carruthers in his many letters that he’s sent me -- I assume he’s sent\n      copies of the letters to his counsel and to others; but I’ve certainly got\n      them, and they will be made a part of the record. And because of the\n      types of things he alleged in those letters a nd the positio n that it p ut his\n      previous attorneys in, and their very, very strong feelings about not\n      continuing to represent Mr. Carruthers under those c ircums tances , I\n      have reluctantly agreed to let them withdraw.\n      ...\n             And as I have sta ted, I’m run ning ou t of patienc e with reg ard to\n      these different issues -- and I use that word advisedly -- being raised by\n      the clients w ith rega rd to an y obje ctions they h ave w ith rega rd to the ir\n      attorneys. And as far as I’m concerned, there are the attorneys\n      [Massey and Sayle] that will represent these men at trial. It’s going to\n      have to be one gigantic co nflict -- one gigantic and real proven,\n      demo nstrated conflict before any of these men will be relieved from\n      representation in this case. There will be no more perceived conflicts,\n      no more unfou nded , wild alle gations raised through correspondence,\n      no more dissatisfaction with how my attorney is handling my case for\n      anybody to be relieved in this case.\n             These are the attorneys, gentlemen. You either work with them\n      or don’t. It’s up to you. Bu t they’re the men th at are going to be\n      represe nting you at trial. . . . [empha sis adde d].\n\n\n      The court also , consiste nt with prior practice in this case, authorized an initial\n\n$1,000 for investigative services and conditioned any further compensation on an\n\nitemized showing of necessity by the investigator. Massey stated he preferred to\n\nuse his own investigator rather than a third attorney; the investigator was Arthur\n\nAnderson, the same investigator originally hired b y counsel in this ca se. Thereafter,\n\nfor some reason, the trial court entered two orders to that affect. An order filed\n\nAugust 11, 1995, allowed Morton and G arrett to withdraw and appointed Attorneys\n\nWilliam Massey and Harry Sayle; an order filed on September 29, 1995, permitted\n\ncounsel and Glenn Wright to withdraw.\n\n\n\n      On August 11, August 31, and September 27, 1995, the trial court authorized\n\nadditional compensation for investigative services. In a hearing on August 11, 1995,\n\ndue to his rec ent ap pointm ent, M asse y requ ested and w as gra nted a trial\n\ncontinuance until Ja nuary 8, 199 6.       Ma ssey inform ed the court th at there still\n\nremained som e disco very to be ha d in the case and that his investigator had been\n\nworking diligently on the matter.\n\n                                            11\n\f       Like previo us co unse l, Massey and Sayle filed numerous pretrial motions on\n\nbeha lf of the app ellant. In a hearing on November 17, 1995, Massey informed the\n\ncourt that he had filed all the necessary and appropriate pretrial motions. On\n\nDecember 19, 1995, Massey filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Cou nsel’s\n\nmotion expla ined th at “his re lations hip with [Carruthers] has deteriorated to such a\n\nserious degree that he can not provide effective assistance as required by state and\n\nfederal law. . . C ouns el’s professional judgment cannot be exercised solely for the\n\nbene fit of Defendant, as counsel fears fo r his safety and those around him. As such,\n\ndefendant cannot have effective communication with counsel to discuss the case\n\nand counsel cannot discuss strategy and legal options with Defendant.” Attached\n\nto this nine page motion are seve ral letters Ca rruthers m ailed to co unsel in late\n\nNovember and early December 1995. In these letters, Carru thers accused counsel\n\nof lying, threa tened c ounse l, and can didly exp ressed his overa ll dissatisfactio n with\n\nthe way counsel handled his case. Excerpts from these letters are quoted below:\n\n\n\n       [Letter dated November 22, 1995] You have violate[d] the code of\n       ethics by lying to me and my co-defendant James Montgomery that the\n       prosecutor Jerry Harris had a plea barg ain of 25 y ears. W e both\n       declined your offer and found out later that you lied along with attorney\n       J.C. McLin and Harry Sayle. I will will [sic] and report you to the board\n       of professional responsibility ethic misconduct [sic]. I want your\n       dishonesty, fraud and deceit to be exposed and acknowledged. You\n       must withdr aw fro m m y case before you fu rther p rejudic e my case . I’m\n       not going to let you deny me a fair trial. I’m asking you as nice as I can\n       to stay away from me. You have less than 72 hours to withdraw from\n       my case, or I will do what I would have to do; [emphasis added]\n\n       [Letter dated December 2, 1995] I want to make this statement that\n       you are about to cross a [sic] innocent man out of his life. I hope you\n       can live with that. You and your friend are the ones that are in a [sic]\n       organization, and y ou’ll [sic] are all a thr eat to the black men, but make\n       this one your best one, because you deserve it! you have practice [sic]\n       law 15 years and you got to look good, because you can’t keep doing\n       this forever. You save the best for last. P.S. This is your last one!\n        [emphasis added]\n\n       [Letter dated December 5, 1995] You have violated several ethic codes\n       with your style and tactics. I don’t know if you want to find another\n       profession or not. This one Black man that w on’t allo w you to walk\n       around pride [sic] with you [sic] head up high. I want your licen se to\n       practice law revoke [sic] or suspended. I don’t know how far you plan\n       to play this game but I’m serious. I should be seeing you soon, and I\n       don’t know what you a re exp ecting . I prom ise it wo n’t be th at sam e old\n       sweet smooth talking. It better be some actions around your words.\n       Life is to [sic] short to be playing games with you. Read what the Legal\n       Medical Dictionary has to describe it. You need to get your sorry but\n       [sic] over here to this jail house and tell me what kind of strategy you\n       have fo r trial Mr. Slick T alker;\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       [Letter dated December 6, 1995] I want to see you in [sic] your\n       investigator over at the jail as soon as you receiv e this letter w ith a full\n       report and transcribe interviews from witnesses. Please do not come\n       with anything that isn’t proper, because if it ain’t right you w ill have to\n       do it again. I’ll be looking for you soon. Everyday until my trial date you\n       need to send somebody over here to keep me informed of your\n       progress.\n\n       [Letter dated December 7, 1995] You are one white boy i don’t even\n       worry about. Your brains are going to get your slick racist ass in a\n       who le lot of trouble . All I tell you is to do you [sic] want to do, and I’ll do\n       what I HAVE TO DO! Point blank!; [emphasis added]\n\n       [Letter dated D ecem ber 15, 1 995] I’ve tried everythin g in the w orld to\n       be fair with you racist CR ACK ERS ! I’m telling you now there will be no\n       turning back the hands of time. You have violated my rights to equal\n       protection, and there will be no COMPROMISING! I don’t know if you\n       are on that COCAINE again but don’t let the d rug alter yo u [sic] ability\n       to see the truth and no [sic] the truth. I will not excep t [sic] anything\n       other than the truth. I realize you boys went to school to be\n       profess ional liars, bu t I’m not ha ving it.\n\n\nAlso attached to the m otion is a statem ent from M assey’s sec retary describing\n\nCarru thers’s abusive and threatening tone during her telephone conve rsations w ith\n\nhim:\n\n\n\n       I received a collect call from Tony Carruthers . . . on December 13,\n       1995. . . . It was then he started screaming and cursing, most of which\n       I couldn’t u ndersta nd. One p art I did understand and remember was\n       that if he go t close enou gh to B ill [Mas sey] h e was going to whip his\n       white ass. He repeated this several times. The way he was screaming\n       and yelling rea lly scar ed m e. I belie ve he was v ery se rious in his\n       threats. I told him that I wa sn’t go ing to list en to h is threa ts and he sa id\n       “F--k you, too, you whore,” at least twice before I started to hang up.\n       [emphasis added]\n\n\n       On December 19, 1995, the trial court held a hearing on pretrial motions,\n\nincluding counsel’s motion to withdraw. Before counsel presented arguments, the\n\njudge made the following statements for the record:\n\n\n\n               A couple of statements I need to m ake for the reco rd before we\n       begin the hearings that were scheduled today, the cases, in fact, set for\n       trial on the 8th of January.\n               My first statement is that all statements that these defendants\n       need to mak e to this Co urt can and will be m ade th rough their\n       attorneys. They are represented by very experienced, highly effective,\n       excellent trial attorneys and anything they need to say, w ith regard to\n       their trial, will be addressed to me throug h their a ttorney s. And if there\n       are any disruptions or problems -- disruptions caused by the\n       defend ants in the process of these hearings, then they will be removed\n       to the room behind this do or, and we’ll co ntinue with the hearin gs in\n       their absence.\n               Secondly, the letters that I have received from Mr. Mon tgomery\n       and Mr. Carruthers over the past several months I have diligen tly tried\n\n                                              13\n\f     to main tain. I’ve hand ed the m all o ver to the clerk’s office. They’ve\n     filed them all in one of th e clerk’s files. W e have dozens if not hundreds\n     of letters from these two defendants over the past several months. I’ve\n     opened each one. I’ve read each one. I’ve tried to give copies to\n     defense counsel. If I’ve not done that I’ve certainly made them\n     availa ble by putting them in the jacke ts. There ’s been n o secre t as to\n     the content of any of the letters.\n             About a week ago I received a letter from one of the defendants,\n     Mr. Carruthers, in which he told me that he was going to send me an\n     envelope full of roaches from the jail. I gues s to -- I guess to suggest\n     that there is a roach p roblem in the S helby Cou nty Jail or whatev er.\n     But my job description does not include opening letters of that sort. So,\n     for the record I will no longer open any letters from either of these\n     defendants. They have from that day and will continue to be put\n     imm ediate ly in the trash. If they have anything to say, they can, again,\n     address me through their attorneys. They’re represented by excellent\n     coun sel, and they can se nd lette rs to the ir attorneys, and their attorneys\n     can then address me on anything that relates to this case.\n\n\n     The court the n heard statem ents from Mass ey con cerning his motio n to\n\nwithdraw.\n\n            I would ju st say I don’t n eed to, I don’t guess, repeat word for\n     word what’s in [m y motion ]. I would just say that in 15 years of\n     practicing law, I have never ever made a motion of this nature. I have\n     never -- I’ve neve r found it difficu lt to advoc ate on b ehalf of a c ase. I\n     wou ldn’t find it difficult to advocate on behalf of this cas e. I do a t this\n     point, however, find it very difficult to advocate on behalf of Mr.\n     Carruthers. And that is simply because he’s made it that way.\n            If I were receiving letters that merely stated I was incompetent\n     and that I wasn’t handling his case right, and those type letters -- we all\n     get those time to time -- I don’t mind those. Those don’t bother me.\n            When I have letters that come to me that are threatening, when\n     I have telephone calls that come to my office that are threatening the\n     safety of me and my staff and those around me, I have real problems\n     with that.\n            It’s gotten so bad, Your Honor, that my secretary is having\n     nightmares. The la st call M r. Carru thers m ade is Exhib it E to this\n     verified motion . She called me in absolute tears crying uncontrollably,\n     hyste rically crying over his antics. That’s the same way he’s been\n     doing m e. I just have n’t broken down and star ted crying about it.\n            But I do have very, very strong, such strong personal\n     reservations as I have never experienced before as an advocate. Your\n     Honor, in adv ocatin g cas es, pa rticularly capital cases, I find the first\n     thing I have to do to be persuasive is to believe. I have to believe and\n     I have to feel. Because if I don’t believe and I don’t feel and I’m not\n     sincere, I cannot impart that to a jury. They see my insincerity. They\n     just see words, a parrot-like proficiency as opposed to feeling. They\n     don’t act on that. They shut that out. That’s been my experience. And\n     I don’t believe that that feeling, I know that I can’t advocate. I’ve lost\n     my will to advocate on this case. I don’t have any doubt about that at\n     this point. I don’t have any doubt. I’ll tell you as an officer of this c ourt.\n     I don’t have any doubt that would be a major problem.\n            And despite Mr. Carruthers threats and antics, I care for the\n     integrity of the system. I care that his rights are protected even when\n     he tries to destroy them himself and impair them. And I don’t know\n     what the Cou rt’s answ er is. I know that the Court is in a ve ry difficu lt\n     position here.\n            Obviously, it’s very clear what the ploy is. It’s very clear that\n     we’re never g oing to ge t to trial like this. And if we do , then th ere’s\n     going to be a record made for ineffective assistance of counsel. And\n     they believe, Mr. Carruthers believes, that doing all of thes e thing s is\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      going to make him a record, as opposed to doing things from a legal\n      standpoint in the courtroom.\n\n\nThe trial judge responded:\n\n\n             In my opinion, to try to make the record reflect as clearly and\n      accu rately as possible the fact that the system is doing everything it can\n      to mak e sure that M r. Carru thers is prope rly and thorou ghly\n      represented in this case.\n             And Mr. Carruthers may step out to the back. He just was\n      pointing to Mr. M assey w ith some sort of threatening gesture. And h e’s\n      going to sit in the back for the rem ainde r of this hearing. Put him in the\n      back room and keep him back there. Lock the door. Mr. Montgomery,\n      you will join him in a minute if you choose to conduct yourself in that\n      man ner as well.\n             The system has done all it can, in my opinion, to ma ke sure that\n      Mr. Toney [sic] Ca rruthers is well represented. And I’ve tried to be as\n      patient as I can be in listening to the concerns of defense counsel and\n      investigators in ma king sure that no conflict existed in the\n      representation of either of these men.\n             The specific reasons, the narrow specific reasons for the excusal\n      of the previous a ttorneys and inv estigators differ a little bit from those\n      comp laints that Mr. Mas sey has raise d today. And so when Mr.\n      Massey says “That just because I’m the 4th or 5th attorney in line\n      does n’t mea n that I n ow ha ve to b e stuc k, in effe ct, in rep resen ting him\n      just because others have been relieved and the Court is anxious to get\n      the case tried. My complaints are as valid as theirs were. And if they\n      were relieved, then I should be relieved as we ll.” And I understand that\n      position. But first of all I’ll respond to that by s aying the ir comp laints\n      were a little bit different, and I’m not going to go through them on the\n      record now. The record is clear in tho se inst ance s. One enve lope is\n      sealed with several letters that will reveal what those complaints w ere\n      and the complaints from attorneys prior to th at we re a little bit different\n      in nature. Not to minimize the seriousness of Mr. Massey’s complaints,\n      but those complaints were a little bit different. And so it’s not that he\n      just happens to be the 5th atto rney in line, an d he’s the on e that is\n      going to quote, get stuck, representing Mr. C arruth ers.                   Th eir\n      comp laints were a little bit different. And factually there are some\n      distinctions that can be drawn between the complaints that they had\n      and the complaints that you’ve voiced.\n\n      Mr. Massey : Your Hon or, is the Court finding tha t my com plaints are\n      of a less serious nature than those previously made?\n\n      The Court: Yes. Yes, I am.\n\n      Mr. Massey: The threats of physical bodily harm?\n\n      The Court: Yes, I am. And I’m not minimizing those threats. And I\n      understand that the threats that yo ur secretary rec eived affected h er,\n      and I don’t dou bt that at all. But I do find that they a re different --\n\n      Mr. Massey: Threats I received.\n\n      The Court: And that yo u’ve received , certainly. But I think they are\n      different and less serious in nature and not such as would prevent you\n      from going forward in this case. [emphasis added]\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fThe trial judge stated that he was “much less rece ptive to the se sorts o f argum ents\n\nthan [he] was a year ago when the first set of attorneys came in wanting to be\n\nrelieved.” He also stated that Carruthers never requested to proceed pro se, and\n\nthat he was “not going to force a ma n to go pro se in a cap ital case if he do esn’t\n\nwant.” The trial court denied Massey ’s motion to withd raw. The trial court, ho wever,\n\ndid authorize additional funds for investigation and mitigation.\n\n\n\n       In another hearing on Janua ry 2, 1996, Massey again requested permission\n\nto withdraw. Massey informed the court that he had continued to receive threatening\n\nletters at his home and was co ncerne d for his da ughter’s s afety because Carruthers\n\nreferred to the car she drove. Mas sey stated tha t he cared m ore about C arruthers\n\nreceiving a fair trial than Carruthers himself did, but that due to the actions of\n\nCarruthers Massey did not believe he could responsibly represent him. He told the\n\ncourt, quite c learly, “I d on’t want to repres ent this man . I can’t re prese nt him . I won’t\n\nrepresent him .”\n\n\n\n       During this hearing, the prosecution, for the first time, voiced its position on the\n\nmatter. The prosecutor recounted the procedural history of the case, that several\n\nextrem ely competent and professional attorneys were forced off the case by\n\nCarruthers, and stated:\n\n\n\n       And if a defendant, Your honor, can threaten the system, if he can\n       manip ulate the system by threats, by letters, I’m not sure if that’s what\n       the makers of the constitution meant when they sat in Philadelphia and\n       they said, look, let’s let every defendant have a fair trial. Le t’s let him\n       have a lawyer. Let’s let a jury be over here. Let’s let him have a judge;\n       that’s fair. Let’s let no m an be accu sed o f a crim e, will not go to trial,\n       unless he receives a fair trial. Let no man be c onvicted -- but the\n       framers of the constitution, Your Honor, had not met Tony Carruthers.\n\n\nThe prosec utor und erstood Mass ey’s pred icame nt, but told the co urt it sim ply could\n\nnot allow Carruthers to continue the trial of the case any longer. The court, again,\n\ndenied Massey’s request. The court’s main concern, apparently, was that it could\n\nnot just keep granting these requests to withdraw; there had to be an end to it. The\n\ncourt noted, tho ugh, tha t everything that had taken place during the course of the\n\nproceedings had be en reco rded so the app ellate courts “can un derstand w hy we’re\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fin this dilemm a that we ’re in today . So that they ca n understan d why M r. Carruthers\n\nwou ld be representing himse lf . . . so that they can have the full understanding.” At\n\none point during the hearing, Carruthers stated to the court that he did not w ant\n\nMassey representing him because Massey was on co caine. The rec ord also reflec ts\n\nthat during the hea ring Car ruthers w as glaring at Mas sey an d gritting his ja w.\n\n\n\n       Although the trial c ourt pr eviou sly me ntione d that it w as no t going to force\n\nCarruthers to repre sent h imse lf in this ca pital trial, after furthe r though t the court,\n\nciting federa l case la w, stat ed tha t Carru thers h ad tw o optio ns rem aining, either\n\nproceed with Massey and Sayle or proceed pro se. The record clearly reflects that\n\neveryone involved in this case , with the a pparen t exceptio n of Carr uthers, w as\n\nparticu larly frustrated w ith the turn of events. The court, for the record again, stated\n\nthat in its opin ion all o f the atto rneys appo inted in this case were excellent trial\n\nlawyers and had fully performed their duties, including filing all relevant motions and\n\nthoroughly pursuing the investigation.\n\n\n\n       Thereafter, Massey sought a T.R .A.P. 10 extrao rdinary appea l to this Cou rt.\n\nIn an order dated January 8, 1996, this Court re counte d som e of the sta temen ts\n\nfrom the letters written by Carruthers, including a description of the car driven by\n\nMassey’s daughter, a n alleg ation th at Ca rruthe rs’ friend s cou ld disco ver de tails\n\nabout Mass ey like the c olor of his too thbrush in his hom e, and a statement to the\n\ntrial judge accusing Massey of using cocaine.            After noting that several other\n\nattorneys were allowed to withdraw in this case, the Court stated:\n\n\n\n              This Court is of the opinion that the attorney-client relationship,\n       which may have previously existed, has deteriorated until such a\n       relation ship does not exist between Carruthers and Mr. Massey. Also,\n       the circumstances of this case m ake it imp ossible fo r Mr. Ma ssey to\n       ethica lly represent Mr. Carruthers. Carruthers has proclaimed that he\n       will do bodily harm to Massey. He has in essence and in fact\n       threatened Massey with death. Carruthers, who has a history of violent\n       condu ct, is apparently a member of a gang. All of his correspondence\n       to Massey carries a drawing of a lidless eye that watches from the top\n       of a pyramid. M oreover, Massey’s family is filled with fear and an xiety\n       due to the threats made to Massey; and Massey’s secretary, who has\n       had dealings with C arruthers by telep hone, likewise has fear and\n       anxiety based upon her conversations with Ca rruthers a nd the thr eats\n       made against Massey. Given these circumstances, Mr. Massey had no\n       alternative but to seek permission to withdraw as counsel. He is\n       supported in this endeavor by the Disciplinary Counsel for the\n\n                                             17\n\f       Tennessee Supreme Court Office, which advised Massey that he was\n       ethica lly required to withdraw as counsel, and, if the motion was\n       denied, he was required to seek relief in the appellate courts.\n       ...\n               Given these facts and circumstances as well as the relevant\n       provisions of the Code of Professional Conduct, which governs the\n       conduct of lawyers in the State of Tennessee, Mr. Massey was entitled\n       to be relieved as c ounsel of reco rd for Mr. Carruthers. If there ever was\n       an amic able a ttorney -client re lations hip, it was erad icated by M r.\n       Carruthers’s conduct in writing the letters aforementioned and\n       threatening to do bodily harm to Mr. Massey the first time he saw him.\n       Today, Mr. Massey and Mr. Carruthers are at odds and their\n       differences are irreconcilable.           Furthermore, Mr. Massey, who\n       emp hatica lly denied any m iscondu ct or add iction to dru gs, mu st attempt\n       to protec t his fam ily, secr etary, a nd him self from physical harm as well\n       as protect himself from further disciplinary complaints.\n\n\n       This Court granted Massey’s request and allowed him to withdraw.\n\nInterestingly, in a hearing on January 8, 1996, the trial court allowe d coun sel to\n\nwithdraw, but this was appa rently before the jud ge rec eived a cop y of this Cour t’s\n\norder. That day, Massey had filed a supplement to his motion to withdraw, and\n\nattach ed se ven m ore lette rs Ca rruthe rs ma iled to c ouns el’s ho me a nd bu sines s in\n\nlate December 1995. These letters were also attached to the application Massey\n\nfiled in this Court. Although Carruthers was aware of the motion to withdraw filed by\n\nMassey, he persisted in sending even more letters to counsel which only added\n\nammunition to counsel’s cau se. In these letters, Ca rruthers again, in an accusatory\n\nand threatening tone, expressed his dissatisfaction with Massey’s representation:\n\n\n\n       [Letter dated December 19, 1995] Hey M r. Attorn ey yo u sit aroun d in\n       your big tie office in Raleigh and ride around in your 1994 Ford Probe.\n       I can’t even get 50 full hours of inves tigation out of you or y our sorry\n       investigator but that’s okay, because I have investigator [sic] myself and\n       they don’t charge me anything and a couple [sic] of days I’ll be able to\n       tell you anything you need to know even the color of a toothbrush they\n       are good I’m telling you they aren’t from Memphis so you know they\n       must be pretty good.

[emphasis added]\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f      [Letter dated December 27, 1995] Look BOY you don’t have to except\n      [sic] my calls or come to see me.

Like I to ld you, let your\n      conscience be your guide.\n\n      [Letter to trial judge dated December 27, 1995] I have once, twice, and\n      even three times wrote you and made you aware that my attorney of\n      the record William D.

Massey has refused\n      to prope rly investigate my case. He refuse to file prosecutorial\n      misconduct charges against the Asst. Attorney General Jerry Harris.\n      He also is addicted to cocaine a [sic] illegal controlled substance which\n      affects his ability to practice law. This is a disgrace to the judicial\n      system.\n\n\nThe record also reflects that Carruthers filed a disciplinary complaint against Massey\n\nwith the Board of Professional Responsibility.\n\n\n\n       Just before the start of jury selection, the trial court, again citing federal\n\nopinions, ruled that Carruthers had forfeited his right to counsel by his egregious\n\nconduct and compelled him to proceed pro se. The trial court, however, appointed\n\nMassey and Sayle to serve as “elbow counsel.”               Despite Massey’s continued\n\nposition that the attorne y-clien t relation ship had com pletely deteriorated, C arruthers\n\ninformed the court that he tried to reconcile with Massey the weekend before the\n\nstart of trial. When the judge made his ruling, Carruthers expressed his concerns\n\nto the court about proceeding pro se; he informed the judge, in essence, that he had\n\nno idea what to do. The judge stated:\n\n\n\n              Well, those are the pe rils in going forward pro se. And in my\n       judgm ent, Mr. Carruthers, as I’ve said on seve ral occ asion s, and I don’t\n       intend to g et back in to a lengthy hearing on this issue at this time, but\n       we’ve had two or three hearings already on this.\n              In my judgment, and I understand you’re stating now that you\n       don’t feel capable of g oing forward and representing yourself. But you\n       need to und erstan d that in my judgment you have created this problem\n       for yourse lf. You are the autho r of your ow n predica ment b y, in my\n       opinion, sabotaging the representation of you by four previous\n       attorneys. These are now your fifth and sixth attorneys. In my\n       judgm ent, because of actions that you’ve taken over the past 18\n       months, because of ac tions th at you ’ve tak en, yo u are n ow in th is\n       situation.\n              And so it ma y well b e difficu lt for you to go fo rward in\n       representing yourse lf, but this is the situation that you’ve created and\n       you’re going to hav e to do the be st you can, b ecau se the re is virtually\n       no option left at this point. To reset it again, history would show would\n\n                                             19\n\f      only -- would be a futile effort, because at the eleventh hour with the\n      seven th and eighth attorneys representing you, there would be some\n      other effort, in my opinion, s ome o ther ma nipulation on you r part that\n      wou ld then cause those attorneys to come in and want to get off your\n      case. And then we’d reset it and appoint the ninth and tenth attorneys,\n      and the eleventh and twe lfth. And the re’d be n o end to it.\n      ...\n              And so we ’re goin g forw ard an d you ’re goin g to represent\n      yourse lf. I understa nd you ’re not an e xperien ced attor ney. I\n      understand you may well have never gone through a voir dire process\n      before. And that’s unfortunate. I wish you had cooperated and gotten\n      along with M r. Nan ce a ye ar and a half a go. He was a n exc ellent\n      attorne y, has tried m any, m any c ases in thes e cou rts, serio us diffic ult\n      cases and done an excellent job.\n              I wish you had cooperated and gotten along with Coleman\n      Garrett who, in my opinio n, is on e of the best tria l attorne ys in this\n      entire state. He’s tried many cases in this courtroom and defended\n      individ uals re mark ably w ell.\n              I wish y ou ha d coo perate d and gotten along with M r. Craig\n      Morton, and Mr. Glen Wright, and Mr. Harry Sayle, and Mr. William\n      Massey, beca use I th ink it would’ve been in your best interest to have\n      done so. But it’s been obvious that you have not. And so for that\n      reason we’re going forward.\n      ...\n              It’s not easy to make this decision. It’s not a decision that I made\n      lightly or take ligh tly. But I tell you wh at, if this record isn’t com plete\n      enough and replete enough with evidence of manipulative conduct and\n      obstructionism, then I can’t imagine ever there being a record for the\n      appellate courts in Tennessee that would meet that criteria.\n\n\nThe record indicates that in an effort to waive any conflict with Massey representing\n\nhim at trial Carruthers wanted to take the stand to apologize and te stify that the\n\naccusations he mad e against cou nsel earlier were untrue. The court noted that this\n\nwas m erely ano ther tactic C arruthers was us ing and denied the requ est.\n\n\n\n       On January 9, 1996, this Court filed an addendum to its previous order and\n\nordered that Massey be completely relieved of any representation of Carruthers,\n\nincluding providing assistance as “elbow counsel.” On January 11, 1996, during voir\n\ndire, the state requested a trial continuance due to the hospitaliza tion of one of its\n\nmaterial witnesses. Th e court resche duled trial until April 15, 1996 . Carruthers\n\nmade an oral request for appointment of new counsel. The trial court denied the\n\nrequest, reiterating w hat it had stated ea rlier:\n\n\n\n              The system will not be held hostag e by To ny Car ruthers, a nd to\n       go throug h ano ther ro und o f attorne ys will be doing just that, because\n       history suggests, as you’ve done in the past, that is if new attorneys\n       were appoin ted and spent the time and investigated, the effort to get\n       ready on this case, then at the eleventh hour something would happen,\n       some allegation s would be ma de that w ould un dermin e their ability to\n       represent you, they’d ask to withdraw, we’d be back in the same\n\n                                            20\n\f       situation that we were in with Mr. Larry Nance, with Mr. Coleman\n       Garrett, with Mr. Bill Massey, all three of whom are outstanding criminal\n       defense attorney s. All three of who m we re fully capable of representing\n       you, and all three of whom had to be relieved because of your actions.\n              And in my judgment, enough is enough. And because of your\n       actions, these attorneys are no longer representing you and, therefore,\n       you will be representing yourself. You have ample time to prepare.\n       You have access to legal opinion from Mr. Sayle. You have the file.\n       You have the rules. You have a jury consultant. You have an\n       investigator. And this is the manner in which we’re going forward.\n\n\n       On January 19, 1996, the trial court entered orde rs allowing Ca rruthers to hire\n\na jury selection consultant and an investigator. During a hearing on January 16,\n\n1996, the appellant informed the court that he had contacte d a new investiga tor to\n\nassist him. The court talked to this new investigator about the nature of the case and\n\nquestioned whether he would be able to proceed to trial on April 15, 1996. The\n\ninvestigator informed the court that he had discuss ed the m atter with the appellant\n\nand was in the process of assem bling an in vestigative team. He stated that he had\n\nthe files that had already been prepared and indicated that he would complete the\n\ninvestigation by that date. The court allowed John Billings to assist the appellant\n\nand authorized Billings to contact the court if additional funds were needed. The\n\ncourt also cautioned the appellant that this would be the last investigator appointed\n\nin this case.\n\n\n\n       In February 1996, Carruthers filed two more written motions for appointment\n\nof counsel, which were also denied by the trial court for the same reasons mentioned\n\nearlier.   In a hearing on February 20, 1996, the court recounted the lengthy\n\nprocedural history of this case and cited several federal opinions discussing a\n\ndefen dant’s forfeiture of counsel due to defendant’s hostile actions. The court stated\n\nthat “it will be apparent to anyone who objectively views this situation th at Mr.\n\nCarruthers is not being denied right to cou nsel.” Also during the hearing on the 20th,\n\nthe court entertained some of Carruthers’s pretrial requests for expert services and\n\ndiscovery. Although appellan t represe nted him self at this po int, the reco rd reflects\n\nthat the trial judge continued with a professional approach in this matter and made\n\ninformed decisions after allowing the appellant ample opportunity to make his\n\nargum ents in open court on his pretrial requests. The record suggests that the judge\n\nprovided Carruthers with added guidance and granted him and his investigator\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fcons iderab le latitude during the pre trial hearings. Hearing dates were continued\n\nseveral times to allow the appellant additional time to prepare for his arguments .\n\nMoreov er, at times when Carruthers requested an ex parte hearing, the state\n\nvoluntarily left the courtroom so the appellant could speak freely to the judge.\n\n\n\n      The court eve ntually allow ed Say le to withdr aw as e lbow co unsel du e to\n\nappe llant’s lack of tr ust an d con fidenc e in co unse l and his personal attacks against\n\nSayle. The court denied Carruthers’ motion for court paid accident reconstruction\n\nservices, but granted h is request for a forensic p atholog ist. On March 4, 1996, the\n\ntrial court entered an order denying another request by Carruthers for appointment\n\nof coun sel. Als o on March 4, the court heard arguments from Carruthers on all of\n\nthe remaining p retrial motions he h ad filed. As the trial court no ted and as the record\n\nreflects, the appellant filed various pretrial motions that appear to be similar or the\n\nsame as those filed by counsel before they were allowed to withdraw. In addition,\n\nthe record reflects that the appellant obtained the assistance of another attorney to\n\nprepare som e of the se m otions on his beha lf. The a ppella nt inten ded to retain th is\n\nattorney to represent him, but apparently this never materialized. Among these\n\nmotions are motions for severance, individual voir dire, suppression of evidence, and\n\ngeneral discovery reques ts. Incidentally, once the court removed the final attorney\n\nfrom Carruthers’’s cas e, counsel for M ontgom ery started m oving the cou rt for a\n\nseverance. In fact, almost every time the court held a pretrial hearing on one of\n\nCarru thers’’s requests, cou nsel for Mon tgomery re newed their motion for a\n\nseverance. These were denied.\n\n\n\n        Anoth er oral m otion fo r appo intme nt of co unse l was d enied on Ap ril 15,\n\n1996, the day jury s election s tarted. After trial, Carruthers filed yet another motion\n\nfor appointment of counsel. The trial court appointed Stephen Leffler and Lee\n\nFilderman to represent appellant on the motion for new trial and direct appeal to this\n\nCourt. Even after new counsel were appointed, Carruthers still insisted on filing pro\n\nse motions in the trial court.

In the\n\nfall of 199 3, Sm ith was incarc erated at the M ark Lu ttrell Re ceptio n Cen ter in\n\nMemphis. Appellants Carruthers and Montgomery were also incarcerated there at\n\nthat time. According to Smith, sometime during the early part of November 1993,\n\nSmith and Carruthers were on work detail together at the cemetery where the victims\n\nwere discovered. Part of their duties included placing coffins in the grave sites.\n\nAccording to Smith, at som e point Carruth ers stated “that would be a good way, you\n\nknow, to bury somebody, if you’re going to kill them. He said, you know, he sa id,\n\nyou know, if yo u ain’t got n o body , you don ’t have a case.” Smith testified that he\n\nheard Anderson brought Carruthers back to jail from furlough one day. Montgom ery\n\napparen tly saw Anderson with Carruthers.         Smith overheard Montgomery ask\n\nCarruthers about A nderso n.       Smith testified that he he ard C arruth ers tell\n\nMontgo mery both Anderson and Andre “Baby Brother” Johnson dealt drugs and had\n\na lot of money. Carruthers said when he and Montgomery got out of prison they\n\ncould rob and “ge t” Anders on and Johns on.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      Smith further testified that upon his release, he approached Anderson and\n\nJohnson and told them what he had overheard.           Thereafter, Montgomery was\n\nreleased and Smith saw him on the street sometime in January 1994. “When I had\n\nseen him, he told me that, you know, [Johnson] is trying to get me killed because\n\nhe sa id I went back and told [Johnson] that he supposed to be robbing them, what\n\nhe told me.” Smith testified that he saw James and Jonath an Mo ntgom ery get into\n\na white Jeep Cherokee with Marcellos Anderson and Fred Tucker on February 24,\n\n1994. Smith also sa w Jonatha n Montgo mery “han ging around ” by him self from\n\nabout 5:00 to 6:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n      Smith testified that h e receive d a call from Johns on arou nd 4:00 a.m. on\n\nFebruary 25, 1994. Johnson said Anderson was missing and asked Smith if he had\n\nseen him. Smith, Andre Tucker and Johnson drove around looking for Anderson.\n\nSmith testified the y saw ligh ts on at Ja mes M ontgom ery’s hou se, so w hen Sm ith\n\nreturned home around 5:00 a.m. he telephon ed Mo ntgom ery, desp ite the fact that\n\nhe and Montgomery did not have a friendly rela tionship. Carruthe rs answered the\n\nphone and Sm ith asked to talk to M ontgo mery . Smith aske d Mo ntgom ery if he knew\n\nAnde rson’s whereabouts because he was the last on e he sa w with h im. Smith also\n\ninformed Montgomery that Anderson’s Jeep was found burned in Mississippi.\n\nAccording to Smith, Montgomery said he did n ot feel lik e talkin g, that “W e’ll talk\n\ntomorrow,” and hung up the phone.\n\n\n\n      On cross-examination, Smith acknowledged that he did not have a good\n\nrelation ship with Jame s Mon tgome ry. Smith could no t remem ber the s pecific da te\n\nhe heard Carruthers and Montgomery talking about Anderson.              Nor could he\n\nremember if there we re any o ther inm ates pre sent du ring the co nversa tion. Sm ith\n\nalso acknowledged on cross that prior to h is relea se from prison in the fa ll of 1993\n\nhe and Carruthers “had a fallout” and did not “talk much anymore” because he\n\nlearned that Carruthers and Montgomery “was plotting to do something” to him.\n\n\n\n      Nake ita Montgomery Shaw testified that her cousins, James and Jonathan\n\nMontgomery, and Anderson and Tucker stopped by her house to visit around 4:30\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\for 5:00 p .m. on Febru ary 24 , 1994 . They arrived in a white Jeep Cherokee. Benton\n\nWes t, another of Shaw’s cousins, and Shaw’s four children were also present in the\n\nhouse. Shaw testified that the four men entere d the house and went down to the\n\nbasem ent. James then came back upstairs and asked Shaw if she could leave the\n\nhouse for a while so he could take care of some business. West, the children, and\n\nShaw all left the house. West told Shaw that he would never visit her again if James\n\nwas in the house.\n\n\n\n      When Shaw returned later that evening, Carruthers and James M ontgom ery\n\nwere the on ly individuals she saw in her ho use. M ontgo mery aske d if she could\n\nleave for a little longer. When she returned home again, sometime before 10:00\n\np.m., James M ontgom ery and C arruthers were still the re. The w hite Jeep, how ever,\n\nwas gone, and Shaw did not see or hear Anderson or Tucker. Shaw testified that\n\nMontgo mery told her to put her kids to bed upstairs and stay there until he said\n\notherwise. When M ontgom ery told her he w as leaving sh e went ba ck down stairs\n\nand saw Montgomery, Carruthers, Anderson and Tucker w alk out the front doo r.\n\nShaw locked the front door behind them. She testified that the Jeep had returned\n\nto the front of her house. The next m orning, Jam es, Jonatha n, and Ca rruthers\n\nreturned to Shaw’s house.\n\n\n\n      After the po lice star ted the ir inves tigation in this ca se, Ja mes Mon tgom ery told\n\nShaw that she did not have to talk to the police about a nything. Montgomery also\n\ntold her later that if he was going to be put to death for something he did not do, then\n\n“all of us needed to die.”     Shaw testified that she subsequently moved to her\n\nmoth er’s in Milwaukee with her children and Jonathan Montgo mery because she had\n\nreceived death threats. In early April, Shaw was questioned by the Milwaukee\n\nPolice Department regarding the evening of February 24, 1994. She informed the\n\nofficers of Jonathan’s whereabouts. When she was questioned by the Memphis\n\nPolice Department at a later date, she mentioned that Anderson and Tucker’s hands\n\nwere tied behin d their bac ks whe n they left h er hous e. She testified that she has\n\nbeen afraid for he r life, and during her testimony she stated that she did not see\n\nAnderson and Tucker restrained in any manner. She informed the police that James\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fMontgo mery threate ned h er and told her she could be an accessory. Montgom ery\n\nalso told Shaw that he did not w ant to have to h urt her.\n\n\n\n      On cross-e xamin ation, Shaw testified that she was not afraid of James\n\nMontgo mery but, be caus e of he r involv eme nt in this case, she was still scared. She\n\ntestified that James was living with her in February 1994, and that it was not\n\nuncommon for him to come and go as he pleased. James also brought friends by\n\nthe house occasionally. Shaw testified that she did not care for Anderson, because\n\nhe dealt drugs, and told Ben West that she did not want Anderson in her house.\n\n\n\n      Benton West was a t Shaw ’s house on Feb ruary 24 , 1994. H e testified th at\n\naround 5:00 p.m. James and Jonathan Montgomery, Anderson and Tucker stopped\n\nby the house in a Jeep. West spoke to Anderson and then all four men walked\n\ndownsta irs to the basement. West testified that a couple of minutes later Shaw\n\ncame into the kitch en and told him th at she th ought “they” were being kidnapped.\n\nWest then took Shaw’s children and left the house. West saw Sha w two da ys later,\n\nand she sta ted, “I hope didn’t noth ing happen to them or no thing like that.” On\n\ncross-examination, West testified that he did not see any weapons or notice anything\n\nunusual about the four men as they came inside the house. He also testified that\n\nShaw never told him she was afraid of Anderson or that s he did not want him in her\n\nhouse.\n\n\n\n      Jimmy Lee Maze, Jr., another convicted felon, testified on behalf of the state.\n\nMaze received two letters from Carruthers in the summer of 1993 while Carruthe rs\n\nwas incarcerated. In the first letter, Carruthers mentioned he had “a master plan”\n\nand “all the right ideas and the support to back it.” In his second letter, he stated he\n\nwas trying to get transferred to Mark Luttrell Reception Center. He also wro te: “I\n\ncan’t wait to make tho se streets pay me”; “If you really want to be rich, take time out\n\nwhen you ge t out to listen to my plans and goals”; “Everything I do from now o n will\n\nbe well organized and extremely violent”; “I have big plans for us and th ere isn ’t\n\nanything they can do about it”. Maze also testified that in December 1993, he and\n\nhis brother and Carruthers were riding around together. They happened upon a\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fscene where a car had been s hot in front of Delois Anderson’s house. Jonathan\n\nMontgo mery was at the scene, and when they arrived Montgomery got in the back\n\nseat of the car w ith Carruthers. Maze testified that Carruthers said “it would be the\n\nbest time to kidnap M arcellos,” once Ja mes M ontgom ery was relea sed from custody.\n\nWhen Montgom ery asked w ho Carruthe rs was talking about, Anderson or Johnson,\n\nMaze observed Carruthers bump Montgomery with his elbow. A couple of weeks\n\nlater, on New Year’s night, Maze saw Ca rruthers loading three an tifreeze containers\n\ninto a car. Maze got in the car with Carruthers, and as he was about to light a\n\ncigarette, Carruthers told him not to do it because there was gasoline in the\n\nantifreeze containers.\n\n\n\n      Terre ll Adair, a convicted felon, testified that prior to his incarceration he was\n\ninvolved in the sa le of coc aine w ith Ma rcellos Ande rson a nd An dre Jo hnso n. Ada ir\n\nwas present when Charles Ray Smith warned Anderson and Johnson about\n\nCarruthers and Montgomery.          Sometime in February 1994, Carruthers and\n\nMontgom ery approached Adair and Johnson on the street. Montgomery asked\n\nJohnson and A dair “why did we feel like he was trying to do something, something\n\nto one of us, because if he was trying to do something to us he would come around\n\nand kill our whole family.” Montgomery told Adair and Johnson that he already had\n\nsomeone else targeted, an d that he wa s going to take th is person’s money and\n\ndrugs. Montgom ery also sa id, “if the p olice d idn’t have no body, they wouldn’t have\n\nno case.” Adair s tated th at this was the first time he met Montgomery. Adair also\n\ntestified that Anderson always wore an $1,800 ring. Adair admitted to having been\n\nshot during a drive-by shooting, allegedly something to do with the drug business.\n\nHe also stated that Anderson had previously been shot in a drive-by shooting.\n\n\n\n      Andre Johnson (“Baby Brother”) testified that he, Marcellos Anderson and\n\nTerre ll Adair were best friends and sold cocaine together. According to Johnson,\n\nAnderson was known to carry about $5,000 or $6,000 cash on his person. Johnson\n\nalso stated that Anderson had about $57,000 stored in his mother’s attic. Johnson,\n\nAnderso n and Ad air all wore similar rings. Jo hnson testified tha t when C arruthers\n\nwas released from jail in the fall of 1993, he, Anderson and Adair each gave\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fCarruthers $200, which apparently was customary when someone they knew was\n\nreleased from jail. Johnson stated tha t Anders on trans ported C arruthers to and from\n\njail when he was released on furlough. Johnson testified that after Carruthers was\n\nreleased from jail Charles Smith warned him, Anderson, and Adair to watch out for\n\nCarruthers and Montgomery. Johnson said Anderson did not take Smith’s comment\n\ntoo seriously. According to Johnson, Anderson acted friendly toward Carruthers and\n\ntrusted him. Johnson also testified that he saw Montgomery after he was released\n\nfrom jail. Montgomery stated “this is my neighborhood” and asked Johnson whether\n\nhe want ed to g o to “w ar” ove r it. Mon tgom ery als o told J ohns on, so metim e later in\n\nfront of Johnson’s house, “we already got our man staked out . . . If we wanted some\n\ntrouble or som ething, we go t you right now. W e’d kill your whole fam ily.”\n\n\n\n       On cross, Johnson also admitted he had been shot during a drive-by shooting.\n\nAnderson had also been shot in a similar manner. Johnson also testified that he and\n\nhis asso ciates had p reviou sly been involved in a drug war with a rival organization\n\ncaused by differences in pricing. Upon questioning by Carruthers, Johnson stated\n\nthat when Carruthers was released from jail he mentio ned so methin g to him about\n\na master plan and making a million dollars in about two months.\n\n\n\n       Chris Hines had known the appellants since junior high school. About 9:00\n\np.m. on February 24, 1994, Jonathan Montgomery visited Hines at his home. Hines\n\ntestified that Jonathan told him he killed some people and stole their money; he said,\n\n“Man, a n----r got them folks . . . Cello and them.” Jonathan said “Man, we got them\n\nfolks out at the cem etery on Elvis P resley, and w e got $200 ,000.” Jonathan asked\n\nHines to take him to the cemetery. Hines refused, but allowed Jonathan to borrow\n\nhis car. Although Jonathan said he would return the car in an hour, Hines did not\n\nsee it again until the next morning. Hines also testified that he called James\n\nMontgo mery about 11:00 p.m. that same night. Hines wa s looking for his car.\n\nJames told him he did not know where Jonathan was, but that he would probably not\n\nget his car back until about 4:00 a.m. beca use J onath an ha d to driv e Jam es to h is\n\ngirlfriend’s house. Jonathan, James and Carruthers eventually returned his car\n\naround 8:30 a.m. the n ext mo rning. Th e car wa s mud dy but the three de fendan ts\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\ftook the car to clean the exterior and vacuum the interior, including the trunk. Hines\n\ntestified that Jo natha n told h im again the morning of the 25th that they killed some\n\npeople.   According to Hines, Jonathan was paranoid and nervous. Jonathan\n\nappa rently left the carwash and Carruthers and James asked Hines what Jonathan\n\nhad told him. Hines said Jonathan told him nothing. Several days later James\n\noffered Hines an AK-47 assa ult rifle for his protection. James said the gun had\n\nblood o n it, which w as slang mean ing som eone h ad bee n shot w ith it.\n\n\n\n      On cross-examination, Hines stated that when the three defendants returned\n\nhis car the next morning, James and Carruthers left. Hines stated that he saw\n\nJames and C arruthers about 2 ½ hours later, at which point James asked Hines why\n\nhis car was so muddy. Hines testified that James told him he would take him to get\n\nhis car washed as soon as he got h is check . Hines sta ted that his car was dirty\n\nwhen he let Jonathan borrow it. Hines further testified on cro ss tha t Jona than to ld\n\nhim that “I had to kill them folks.” He stated that Ja mes aske d him what Jonathan\n\nhad told him and said that they needed to find out what Jonathan had done. Hines\n\nalso stated on cross that neither James nor Carruthers directed the man washing the\n\ncar to clean an ything in particular.\n\n\n\n      Orlandus Buddy Sesley, an employee with the Tennessee Department of\n\nCorrection, testified about the op eration at the M ark Luttrell Recep tion Center in\n\nMemphis, where he wa s statione d. The reception Center serves as a processing\n\ncenter for prisoners before they are transported to or released from the various\n\npenitentiaries across the state.        Sesley worked as a counselor assisting and\n\norientating prisoners back into society before their release. Sesley counseled the\n\nappellan ts and Charles Ray Smith .        Carruthers was released from custody on\n\nNovember 15, 1993, Smith on December 15, 1993, and Montgomery on January 11,\n\n1994. Sesley testified that both Sm ith and C arruthers were a ssigned to work release\n\nat a graveyard before their release from custody. Sesley further testified that\n\nCarruthers was rem oved from the ceme tery deta il in Octobe r and give n light duty\n\nwork inside because of a medical problem with his hand or wrist. Sesley authorized\n\nfurloughs for inmates which allowe d a prison er to leave custody for three d ays to\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fmake arrangements for release. Carruthers was granted three furloughs, the last\n\noccurring October 1, 1993. Sesley testified that Montgo mery arrived at the Mark\n\nLuttrell Reception Center on November 4, 1993.\n\n\n\n      On March 3, 1994, Detective Jack Ruby of the Memphis Police Department\n\naccompanied Jonathan Montgomery to the Rose Hill Cemetery on Elvis Presley\n\nBoulevard. Jonathan directed Detective Ruby to the grave site of Dorothy Daniels,\n\nwho wa s buried on F ebruary 25, 199 4. This gra ve site was located six plots away\n\nfrom James Montgome ry’s cousin ’s grave site.         Ruby obtained a court order\n\npermitting disinterment of the casket from this grave. Along with the police officers,\n\ntwo anthropologists and two medical examiners assisted in the removal of the\n\nbodies. The ca sket containing the body of Daniels was located in a plywood box\n\ninside the grave. Below this box, underneath several inches of dirt, they found\n\nanother single piece of plywood. The bodies of the three victims were discovered\n\nundern eath this piece of plywood lying in a pit that had been dug further down in the\n\ndirt. The two male victims were on top of the fe male victim and all three victim s were\n\nbound.\n\n\n\n      Patrick Williams, an employee of the Rose Hill Cemetery, testified that it would\n\nhave taken two people to remove the empty plywood box that was found in Daniels’\n\ngrave. This box was placed in the grave the day before the casket was lowered,\n\nwhich would have bee n during wo rking hours on February 24, 199 4. Acco rding to\n\nDr. Hugh Edward Berryman, one of the forensic anthropologists who assisted with\n\nthe crime scene, the casket of Daniels had not been disturbed after she was buried\n\non the 25th.\n\n\n\n      Dr. O.C. S mith pe rformed the autop sies in this case. He als o ass isted in\n\nremoving the bodies from the grave site. Dr. Smith testified that the fema le victim\n\nwas in the bottom of the grave and the two male victims were found lying on top of\n\nher. The hands of all three victims were tied behind their backs and, in addition, the\n\nfeet of Frederick Tu cker were bound. Delois Anderson also had a red sock around\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fher neck and F reder ick Tu cker’s neck showed signs of bruising caused by a ligature.\n\nDr. Sm ith did not find any jew elry on M arcellos A nderso n.\n\n\n\n       Delo is Anderson died as a result of asphyxia caused by a combination of\n\nfactors: 1) difficulty in breathing due to the position of the body, i.e., her head was\n\nbent forward and he r chin wa s presse d again st her che st, 2) dirt in the mouth and\n\nnose blocking the airflow , and 3 ) traum a from the we ight on her bo dy. Th is victim\n\nalso suffere d traum a befo re she was p laced in the g rave. D r. Sm ith opin ed tha t this\n\nvictim was strang led two to six hou rs before dea th. Also, the victim suffere d a more\n\nrecent wound to the back of her head which could have been caused by a blow from\n\na shovel. She also showed bruising on the elbows, the back of the left shoulder, and\n\nthe forehead, possibly caused when she hit her head o n the bo ttom of the grave.\n\n\n\n       Frederick Tucker received a near gunshot wound to his chest which was not\n\ninstan taneo usly fatal. He also suffered blunt trauma to his abdomen and head,\n\nwhich includ ed bro ken rib s, a frac tured s kull and a rupture d liver. Dr. Smith opined\n\nthat Tucker was shot and then placed in the grave where the force of compression\n\nfrom being buried produced the other injuries and ultimately cause d his death. Dr.\n\nSmith further opined that Tucker was alive when he was placed in the grave. Tucker\n\nalso sho wed sig ns of stran gulation.\n\n\n\n       Marcellos Ander son rec eived thre e guns hot wo unds: a contact wound to his\n\nforehead, which was not that severe, and two gunshot wounds to the neck, one a\n\nnear shot severing his spinal cord and paralyzing him from the chest down. None\n\nof the gun shot wo unds, h owev er, were instantaneously fatal.            Anderson also\n\nsuffered blunt traum a to his ab dome n from b eing bu ried in the g rave.\n\n\n\n       Dr. Smith opined that each victim was buried alive.\n\n\n\n       Appe llant Montgom ery presente d no proof, ho wever, app ellant Carruthers\n\ncalled several witnesses to testify on his behalf. Albert James Herm an, Jr., a health\n\nadministrator at Mark Luttrell Reception Center, testified that on October 6, 1993, the\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fappellant was gra nted a job chang e beca use of an injury to his le ft hand. Freddy L.\n\nMcCullough, a private investigator assigned to this case, interviewed Jimmy Maze\n\nprior to trial. According to McCullough, Maze knew Carruthers was talking about a\n\nmaster plan in his letters, but Maze did not know specifically what Carruthers was\n\ntalking about until Carru thers was re leased from jail (apparently beca use the letters\n\nCarruthers w rote to Maze did not go into de tails or mention na mes).\n\n\n\n       Alfredo Shaw gave a state men t to the p olice in March 1994. Shaw stated that\n\nhe saw a television news report about this case and called crime stoppers to provide\n\ninformation. Some time be fore the m urders, Shaw testified that he was in a three-\n\nway telephone conversation with Carruthers and either Terry or Jerry Durham.\n\nCarruthers told Shaw he had a “sweet plan” and that they would each earn $100,000\n\nand a kilogram of cocaine. Shaw told Carruthers, however, that he did not want to\n\nget involved. Shaw was in the same jail with the appellants after they were arrested\n\nfor these crimes. Shaw testified that Carruthers told him how the crimes w ere\n\ncommitted. Carruthers said he and some other people (he apparently did not\n\nmention the other appellants by name) went to Delois Anderson’s house looking for\n\nMarcellos and h is mone y. Marc ellos w as no t there s o Car ruther s told D elois to call\n\nMarcellos and tell him to come ho me, “it’s some thing importan t.” When Marcellos\n\narrived, the ap pellan ts force d the v ictims (appa rently Tucker arrived with Marcellos)\n\ninto the Jeep at gunpoint and drove them to Mississippi where they shot Marcellos\n\nand Tucker and burned the Jeep. The appellants then drove all three victims back\n\nto Mem phis in a sto len vehic le. Accord ing to Sh aw, Ca rruthers s tated they drove to\n\nthe cem etery a nd pu t Marc ellos a nd Tu cker in the gra ve. De lois started screaming\n\nso one of the appellants told her to shut up or she would die like her son, and then\n\npushed her in the grave . Shaw testified ab out this information b efore the gran d jury\n\nin this case.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers told Sha w that he was no t going to hire an attorney because then\n\nthe state might have learned that they planned the murders in order to steal\n\nMarcellos’ mone y. Carruthers also said th e bod ies wo uld ha ve ne ver be en fou nd if\n\n“the boy wouldn’t have went and told them folks.” Carruthers informed Shaw that\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\fJohnson was also supposed to be “hit.” Carruthers also stated that two other\n\nindividuals, Terry and Jerry Durham, were “the main people behind having these\n\nindivid uals killed.” Apparently the Durhams wanted revenge because they had\n\nprevio usly been ro bbed b y Marc ellos and Johns on. Shaw testified that he feared for\n\nhis safety for having come forward with this information because the Durhams had\n\ncontrol over people who were in jail along with Shaw. Shaw testified at trial that he\n\nattempted to recant his gran d jury testimony and statem ent to th e polic e bec ause his\n\nand his family’s safety was threaten ed by Ca rruthers. Appa rently, Carruthers made\n\narrange ments through one of his investigators to ha ve a new s reporter intervie w\n\nShaw about his recantation. The Durha ms tes tified on be half of Ca rruthers a nd both\n\nindividuals stated that they did not know Shaw nor had they heard of him.\n\n\n\n       Aldolpho Antonio Jame s testified that he was w ith Car ruther s at a frie nd’s\n\nhouse betwe en 1:00 a.m. an d 2:00 a .m. the day before James first saw a news\n\nreport about this case. On cross-examination, however, James admitted that he did\n\nnot know th e date of this enc ounter.\n\n\n\n       Terrance Roderick Carruthe rs, the a ppella nt’s bro ther, tes tified tha t Terre ll\n\nAdair was sh ot in a drive -by sho oting in D ecem ber 199 3. He further testified that he\n\nwent to the hospital later that day with Carruthers, Marcellos Anderson, and And re\n\nJohnson to see Adair. According to his testimony, Jonathan Montgomery was not\n\npresent at the sce ne nor a t the hosp ital. Carruth ers also c alled An tonio Ba teman to\n\nthe witness stand who testified that he did not see Jonathan Montgomery at the\n\nhospital a fter Adair w as sho t.\n\n\n\n       An administrative assistant with the Shelby County Jail testified that Shaw was\n\nnot in the law library of the jail at the same time as Carruthers in February or March\n\n1994. The co nversa tion Carru thers ha d with Shaw allegedly took p lace in the jail\n\nlibrary. Carruthers also called several employees of the Shelby County Jail who\n\ntestified about the various classifications of prisoners and how certain prisoners,\n\nsuch as those in protective custody , are segregated at all times from other\n\nclassifications of prisoners. Some of these employees admitted, however, that this\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\fsystem is not foolproof and that there could be tim es when inmates with different\n\nclassifications could come into contact with one another. Carruthers and Shaw had\n\ndifferent classifications.\n\n\n\n\nSentencing Phase\n\n       During the Sentencing phase of the trial, the state introduced evidence of the\n\nappellants’ prior convictions. Carruthers had a previous conviction for aggravated\n\nassa ult, wh ile Mo ntgom ery ha d two previo us co nvictio ns for ro bbery with a d eadly\n\nweapon and one for assault with intent to commit robbery with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe state also called the medical examiner back to the s tand to testify a bout th e pain\n\nsuffered by the victims.         Dr. Smith testified that none of the victims died\n\ninstantan eously. Each victim s uffered as a re sult of th eir sep arate in juries, a s well\n\nas from the sensation of being buried alive.\n\n\n\n       Nakeita Montgom ery Shaw testified on behalf of M ontgom ery during the\n\nsentencing phase. Shaw and Montgomery were close growing up together. Shaw\n\nstated that she loved her cousin very much and asked the jury to spare his life.\n\nMattie Calhoun, Montgomery’s aunt, testified that Montgomery was an average\n\nstudent in school. She also stated that Montgomery did not have a meaningful\n\nrelation ship with his father. She also begged the jury to spare his life. Mon tgomery\n\ntestified on his own behalf. Mon tgomery a nd his three bro thers and two sisters were\n\nraised by his mother in North Memphis. Montgom ery stated that he was five yea rs\n\nold when he las t saw h is father, w ho wa s still living in M ississip pi at the time o f trial.\n\nHe testified that he pled guilty in his prior cases because he wa s guilty. He testified,\n\nhoweve r, that he was innocent in this case. He stated that he spent a little over nine\n\nyears in the penitentiary for his previous convictions and had secured a job when he\n\nwas r eleas ed. M ontgo mery ’s son w as ten years old at th e time of trial.\n\n\n\n       Bishop R.L. Fiddler had been visiting with Carruthers since his incarceration.\n\nFiddler believed Carruthers was honest and straightforward and a person of quality\n\nand worth. Fiddler stated that Carruthers was upset about the deaths of the victims\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fin this case. Fiddler asked the jury to give Carruthers a chance to live. Tonya\n\nYvette Miller, Carruthers’ sister, testified that their mother raised four children on her\n\nown.   Miller st ated th at they grew up in o ne of th e wor st hou sing p rojects in\n\nMemphis. Carruth ers, the old est son, h ad a lot of re spons ibility as the “man of the\n\nhouse hold.” She lov es her b rother, bu t admitted that he ha d a hot temper. Miller\n\nstated, however, that he never planned to do anything wrong . She told the jury that\n\nher mother raised her children to tell the truth. Miller asked the jury to spare\n\nCarruthers’ life because he is innocent of these crimes. Carruthers took the stand\n\non his ow n beh alf. He to ld the ju ry he was innocent of the crimes and did not\n\ndeserve to die.\n\n\n\n                                       ANA LYSIS\n\nForfeiture of Right to Counsel\n\n       In his first issue, Carruthers claims he was denied his right to due process\n\nwhen he wa s forced to represe nt himse lf during the trial of this capital case. The\n\nstate argues in response that Carruthers forfeited his right to counsel. It is not\n\ndisputed that Carru thers is ind igent.\n\n\n\n       An indigent defendant has the constitutional right to appointed counsel. U.S.\n\nCons t. amend. VI; Tenn . Const. a rt. I, § 9; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83\n\nS.Ct. 792, 9 L.E d.2d 79 9 (1963 ); State v. Northington, 667 S.W.2d 57 (Tenn. 1984).\n\nHowe ver, this right is not absolute, in that a defendant does not hav e the right to\n\nappointment of couns el of choice nor the righ t to a “me aningfu l relationsh ip” with\n\nappointed couns el. See Morris v. Slappy, 461 U .S. 1, 13-1 4, 103 S .Ct. 1610, 1617,\n\n75 L.Ed .2d 610 (1983); United States v. Gallop, 838 F.2d 105, 107 (4th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 487 U.S. 12 11, 108 S.C t. 2858, 101 L.E d.2d 895 (19 88).              Moreo ver,\n\nappointed counsel is not required to blindly follow a defendant’s instruction s, see\n\nUnited States v. Padilla , 819 F.2 d 952, 9 56 (10th Cir. 1987), and a defendant does\n\nnot have the right to manipulate his right to counsel in order to delay or disrup t a trial,\n\nsee United S tates v. W hite, 529 F.2 d 1390 , 1393 (8 th Cir. 197 6). “The rig ht to\n\nassistance of cou nsel, cheris hed a nd fun dam ental th ough it may be, may not be put\n\nto service as a means of delaying or trifling with the court.” United States v. Fowler,\n\n\n                                            36\n\f605 F.2d 18 1, 183 (5 th Cir. 197 9), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 950, 100 S.Ct. 1599, 63\n\nL.Ed.2d 78 5 (1980).\n\n\n\n       Similarly, a defendant may only request a substitution of appointed counsel\n\nfor good c ause s hown . See Gallop, 838 F.2d at 108. Good cause may include a\n\nconflict of interest, a comp lete breakdow n of comm unication, or an irreconcilable\n\nconflict with cou nsel, see United States v. Goldberg , 67 F.3d 109 2 (3rd Cir. 1995 ),\n\nbut does not include defendant’s statements that counsel is unenthused about the\n\ncase or is inadequately addressing the issue s, see, e.g., United States v. Jennings,\n\n855 F.Supp. 1427, 1441 (M.D.Pa. 1994).               Moreover, good cause “cannot be\n\ndetermined solely acco rding to the subjective standard of what the defendant\n\nperceive s.” Thomas v. Wainwright, 767 F.2d 738 (11 th Cir. 198 5), cert. denied, 475\n\nU.S. 1031, 106 S.Ct. 1241, 89 L.Ed.2d 345 (1986). The court may deny a request\n\nfor substitution of couns el if the defen dant’s req uest “pro ceeds from a transparent\n\nplot to bring about de lay.” Gallop, 838 F.2d at 108 (citing Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S.\n\nat 13, 103 S.Ct. at 1617); see also Unite d State s v. Ke lm, 827 F.2 d 1319 , 1322 (9 th\n\nCir. 1987).\n\n\n\n       While the de fenda nt is guaranteed the right to appointed counsel in criminal\n\ncases, this right may be waived. In order for a court to accept defendant’s waiver\n\nof appointed counsel and allow him or her to proceed pro se, the court must find that\n\nthe waiver is v oluntary, k nowing , and intellige nt. Faretta v. Califo rnia, 422 U.S. 806,\n\n95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 56 2 (1975); State v. Sm all, 988 S.W.2d 671 (Tenn. 199 9).\n\nThis should in clude an explana tion to the d efenda nt abou t the inhere nt risks of\n\nproceeding pro se and a determination that the defendant is aware of the nature of\n\nthe charges against him, as well as the possible penalties . See Hendricks v. Zenon,\n\n993 F.2d 664, 670 (9th Cir. 1993 ); Sma ll, 988 S.W.2d at 674. The appellant in this\n\ncase did not vo luntarily wa ive his right to couns el. Eve n after M asse y and Sayle\n\nwere allowe d to with draw , Carru thers c ontinu ed to re ques t appo intme nt of co unse l.\n\nAlthough we find that C arruthers did not w aive his righ t to couns el, we do agree w ith\n\nthe trial ju dge’s conc lusion that C arruth ers forfe ited his right to c ouns el.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f       Forfeiture of a right, as it has been defined by the federal courts, means “the\n\nloss of a right regardless of the defendant’s knowledge thereof and irrespective of\n\nwhether the defen dant inten ded to relinquish the right.” United States v. Goldberg ,\n\n67 F.3d 1092 (3rd Cir. 1995). It is well-recogn ized that criminal defendants may\n\nforfeit certain fundamental constitutional rights. See, e.g., Levine v. United States,\n\n362 U.S. 610, 8 0 S.Ct. 1 038, 4 L .Ed.2d 9 89 (196 0) (right to pu blic trial); Illinois v.\n\nAllen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (right to be present at\n\ntrial); United States v. Boscaro , 742 F.2d 1335, 1365 (11th Cir. 1984) (right to raise\n\ndoub le jeopard y defen se); Broo khart v . Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d\n\n314 (1966) (right to confrontation). And while it appears the appellate courts of\n\nTennessee have not yet addressed the specific issue currently before us, several of\n\nthe federal courts h ave rec ognize d that a de fendan t may a lso forfeit his\n\nconstitutional right to cou nsel. See United States v. Goldberg , 67 F.3d 1092 (3rd\n\nCir. 1995); United States v. McLeod, 53 F.3d 322 (11th Cir. 1 995); United States v.\n\nTravers, 996 F.Supp. 6 (S.D.Fla. 1998). See also United States v. Meeks, 987 F.2d\n\n575, 579 (9th Cir. 1993 ), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 919, 114 S.Ct. 314, 126 L.Ed.2d 261\n\n(1993) (citing Unite d State s v. Ke lm, 827 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir. 1987) and United\n\nStates v. Leavitt, 608 F.2d 1 290 (9th Cir. 197 9) (“In limited circums tances, a cou rt\n\nmay force a de fendan t to proceed pro se if his conduct is “‘dilatory and hinders the\n\nefficient admin istration of jus tice.’”)); United States v. Fazzini, 871 F.2d 635, 642 (7th\n\nCir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S . 982, 110 S.Ct. 517, 107 L.Ed.2d 518 (1989)\n\n(quoting United States v. Moore , 706 F.2d 53 8, 540 (5th C ir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S.\n\n859, 104 S.Ct. 183, 78 L.Ed.2d 163 (1983) (“a persistent, unreasonable demand for\n\ndismissal of counsel and appointment of new counsel . . . is the functional equivalent\n\nof a knowing and voluntary waiver of cou nsel”)).\n\n\n\n       Forfeiting the right to counsel is different than voluntarily waiving the right. It\n\ncan also be distinguished from an implied waiver of the right after having been\n\nwarned that se lf-repre senta tion m ay follo w if the prohibitory condu ct continu es. See\n\nGoldberg , 67 F.3d at 1100. In the case of an implied waiver, the defendant has\n\nbeen cautioned against future conduct and has been informed of the consequences\n\nof his actions. In the case of forfeiture, there may have been no warnings given by\n\n\n                                            38\n\fthe court. In both cases, however, the defendant has not voluntarily waived counsel\n\nnor indica ted that he wishes to proce ed pro s e.\n\n\n\n      In the case at hand, after denying Massey’s motion to withdraw b ut prior to\n\nthis Court’s order on extraordinary appeal, the trial court, referring to some of the\n\nabove-cited federa l law, sta ted tha t Carru thers h ad tw o optio ns rem aining: either\n\nproceed to trial with the assistance of Massey and Sayle or proceed on his own.\n\nThis statement would sugge st that an im plied wa iver resulte d. How ever, as to\n\nMassey, this Court allowed Massey to withdraw shortly after the trial court warned\n\nthe appe llant, an d there fore, the result is more akin to a forfeiture since counsel was\n\nremoved without any additional egregious conduct by Carruthers directed at Massey.\n\nRegarding Sayle, however, Carruthers did engage in additional egregious conduct\n\nresulting in Sayle’s removal. Because the forfeiture of a constitutional right is the\n\nmost severe sanction, the defendant’s conduct leading up to the forfeiture must be\n\nextrem ely dilatory. Id. at 1101. The Goldberg court suggests that an implied waiver\n\n(waiver by conduct) could be based on conduct less seve re. Id. We believe,\n\nhowever, that in either case, the forfe iture of counsel or the implied waive r of\n\ncounsel, since the defendant is not voluntarily giving up one of his basic,\n\nfundamental cons titutiona l rights, th e defe ndan t’s con duct m ust be so ext reme ly\n\negregious and dilatory that the trial court has no other option but to force the\n\ndefendant to proceed pro se. The sanction imposed should be appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances and commensurate with the nature and extent of the de fenda nt’s\n\ncondu ct. Again, the asse rtion of th e defe ndan t’s rights must be weighed against the\n\neffective and efficie nt adm inistration of ju stice. See Leavitt, 608 F.2d at 1293. The\n\ncourts canno t permit de fendan ts to abus e their rights to the detriment of the system.\n\n\n\n      We have not been able to find any capital cases involving the forfeiture of the\n\nright to couns el. Cf. Wate rhouse v. State, 596 So.2d 1008 (Fla. 1992) (defendant\n\nconsidered to have forfeited right to counsel during closing argument of resentencing\n\nhearing in capital ca se). And w hile we are cognizant of the heightened due process\n\nconcerns in death penalty cases, we also recognize that courts cannot be\n\nhandcuffed by the whims of the defendants. Although we are not bound by the\n\n\n                                           39\n\fdecisions of the lower federal courts, after carefully reviewing the record in this case,\n\nwe are persuaded by the reasoning of these decisions concerning forfeiture of the\n\nright to counsel. “We believe th at there m ust be so me lim it to the defe ndant’s a bility\n\nto manipulate the judicial system even if he is unknow ing and uninte lligent.” Gallop,\n\n838 F.2d at 110.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers’ conduct regarding his relationship with Massey has been\n\nthorou ghly outlined above. After Massey was removed from the case completely,\n\nthe court allowed Sayle to remain as “elbow” counsel. The record indicates that the\n\nappellant wished to recan t the accu sations h e mad e towa rd Mas sey. The court,\n\nhoweve r, said enough was enough. As noted above, Sayle was also finally allowed\n\nto withdraw completely from the case . Even after Carruthers lost the assistance of\n\none of his two remaining attorneys, he still continued with his conduct toward Sayle.\n\nThe court had warned Carruthers that he could either cooperate with Massey and\n\nSayle or lose his right to counsel. Apparently, neither the removal of Massey nor the\n\ntrial court’s w arning p ersuad ed Ca rruthers. W hen Sa yle finally m oved th e court to\n\nbe allowed to quit as elbow counsel, he made the following statements:\n\n\n\n               He has expressed the feeling that I am not working for him, and\n       that I have not done anything for him, I’m not going to do anything for\n       him. He suspe cts -- he ’s ma de it cle ar that h e sus pects that I’m\n       working with the sta te in som e capa city. And frankly none of the advice\n       I give h im is followed, and I don’t think there is any intention of following\n       it. And frankly it’s just -- and the abuse ge ts extremely person al.\n       Personal vilification over the last couple of meetings, and I see no ba sis\n       for being able to continue.\n\n\n       The threats C arruthers made in his letters and c alls to M asse y clear ly\n\nthreatened physical violence . Com ments about what type of car Massey’s daughter\n\ndrove and the ability to discover the color of Massey’s toothbrush could be taken no\n\nother way. Carru thers also accused Massey of abusing drugs. The comments and\n\naccusations Carruthers made toward Craig Morton and Coleman Garrett, were much\n\nmore personal. Though the threats of physical violence are not as apparent, we do\n\nnot believe any attorney in Tennessee could work under the abhorrent conditions\n\ncreated by Carruthers. These letters were written in June and July of 1995. Garrett\n\nand Morton were relieved as counsel in late July 1995. These letters were in a\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\fsealed exhibit in the record. They shall remain sealed, and out of respect to the\n\nattorneys involved, we will not reveal the nature of the comments which these\n\nattorneys could rightfully consider outrageous.\n\n\n\n       We have previously quoted extensively from the numerous pretrial hearings.\n\nDuring the hearing on Garrett and Morton’s motion to withdraw, the trial judge\n\nreferred to the outrageous accusations Carruthers made against his attorneys.\n\nHowe ver, the judge did not recite anything specific from these letters. Nor will we,\n\nexcept to say that n o attorne y shou ld have to tolerate the ho stile an d unc omfo rtable\n\natmosph ere created by Carr uthers. The letters to Garrett and Morton indicate that\n\nCarruthers’ conduct was not limited to his relationship w ith Massey . There is simp ly\n\nno evidenc e in the rec ord to su pport any of Carru thers’ accusa tions. This Cou rt\n\nfound on extraordinary appeal that Massey was entitled to withdraw. This was at\n\nleast the fifth attorney appoin ted to rep resent C arruthers who w as allow ed to\n\nwithdraw because o f the ho stile en vironm ent cre ated b y Car ruther s.            Say le\n\nsubs eque ntly was allowed to withdraw for similar reasons. We do not believe this\n\nhistory of abuse would have ceased if yet another set of attorneys were appointed.\n\n\n\n\n       In fact, the history predates this case. The trial judge noted that in a previous\n\ncase, Carruthers had gone through four sets of attorneys. In this respect, we take\n\nnotice of the fact that the de fenda nt wa s con victed of agg ravate d ass ault in 1 990 in\n\na case in whic h he was appointed four successive attorneys due to his continuing\n\ndis-satisfaction with cou nsel. The last attorne y was a ppointe d less tha n a mo nth\n\nbefore trial and was the object of the d efend ant’s u nsuc cess ful pos t-conv iction cla im\n\nof ineffec tive as sistan ce of c ouns el. See Tony V. Carruthers v. State, 02C01-9505-\n\nCR-001 30, Shelby C ounty (Ten n. Crim. App . Apr. 17, 1996 ).\n\n\n\n       As noted above, a criminal defendant does not have the right to a meaningful\n\nrelation ship with his counsel, nor the right to choose which counsel shall be\n\nappointed. See Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S . 1, 13-14 , 103 S.C t. 1610, 1617, 75\n\nL.Ed.2d 610 (19 83); United States v. Gallop, 838 F.2 d 105, 1 07 (4th C ir.), cert.\n\n\n                                             41\n\fdenied, 487 U.S. 12 11, 108 S.C t. 2858, 101 L.E d.2d 895 (19 88). Furthermore,\n\ncounsel is not requ ired to blind ly follow the defend ant’s instru ctions. See United\n\nStates v. Pad illa, 819 F.2 d 952, 9 56 (10th Cir. 1987 ). Counsel, whether appointed\n\nor not, are trained and licensed professionals who are req uired to abide by cer tain\n\nstandards in the performance of their duties. Similarly, the defendant does have the\n\nabsolu te right to make certain choices during his trial. Counsel, however, cannot\n\nsimp ly acquiesce to every single demand or request of the defendant which does not\n\naffect the exercise of certain absolute rights. The Post-Conviction Procedure Act\n\nwas created to add ress any of th e defe ndan t’s con cerns abou t coun sel’s\n\nreprese ntation.\n\n\n\n       Given the history of this ca se, wh ich ha s bee n thoro ughly summarized above,\n\nit is clear to us that C arruth ers w ould not have been satisfied with any attorney and\n\nwas simply trying to manipulate the system. Even after the court appointed counsel\n\nfor the mo tion for new trial and ap peal, Ca rruthers wrote several letters to the trial\n\njudge insisting that his new attorneys were incompetent. We do not believe the trial\n\ncourt interfer ed with the ex ercise of Car ruther s’ cons titutional rights.            After\n\ncons iderab le time and consideration, the trial court properly weighed the effective\n\nand efficient adm inistration of ju stice aga inst Carru thers’ right to couns el. As the trial\n\ncourt observed, Carruthers was the author of his own predicament. Again, there has\n\nto be a point when the courts are permitted to stop the abuse and delay tactics\n\nemployed by a criminal defendant under the guise of his or her constitutional rights.\n\n\n\n       We do not take lig htly the result that a defendant has to proceed pro se in any\n\ntrial, especially one involving a capital offense. Our judicial system could not survive\n\nif those accu sed o f crime s wer e literally run over “roughshod.”            But while the\n\nindividual must be protected by the system, the judicial system must also be\n\nprotected from abuses by an individual. A person charged with criminal acts cannot\n\nbe allowe d to su bvert th e judic ial syste m. Ap pellan t Carru thers w as, in effect, given\n\none last cha nce fo r assis tance of counsel after Massey was allowed to withdraw;\n\nSayle remained as “elbow” counsel for a period of time until he, too, was allowed to\n\nwithdraw due to C arruthers ’ conduc t. The removal of Sayle came after Carruthers\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fwas clearly warned by the trial court that his conduct could result in him being\n\nrequired to proceed pro se at trial. A reversal of a conviction and a rem and for a\n\nnew trial is done with the appellate court having confidence that the new trial will\n\ncorrect the previous error. We concur with the trial court’s judgment in this case that\n\nno matter how man y time s Car ruther s mig ht be a llowed to hav e cou nsel, h e wou ld\n\ncontinue his egregious conduct to force counsel off the case until ultimately, again,\n\nhe would have to proceed pro se. Carruthers is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n\n\n        The appellant also claims that because he was forced to represent himself the trial judge did not\n\ntreat him fairly or in the same manner as an attorney. Carruthers argues this was prejudicial error\n\nrequiring a new trial. Having reviewed each of the numerous instances cited by appellant on appeal in\n\nthis respect, we do not believe the trial court denied the appellant a fair and impartial trial. When this\n\nCourt allowed Massey off the case, Carruthers expressed his concerns to the trial judge about\n\nproceeding pro se. The judge stated that this was unfortunate but reminded Carruthers that he placed\n\nhimself in this position. The Court assigned Massey and Sayle as elbow counsel and informed the\n\nappellant that they would provide assistance and advice during trial. Shortly thereafter, however, this\n\nCourt ruled that Massey was to be completely removed from any involvement in this case. Carruthers\n\nagain asked for appointment of new counsel, but the judge denied this and stated that Sayle would\n\nremain to assist. Even at this point, when the appellant had expressed concerns about proceeding to\n\ntrial without counsel, he still persisted with his antics which eventually led to the removal of Sayle from\n\nservice as elbow counsel.\n\n\n\n        While a pro se litigant is not held to the same strict standards as a practicing attorney, see, e.g.,\n\nBaxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930 (Tenn. 1975), because he is proceeding without the assistance of\n\ncounsel does not mean the court must completely ignore the procedural and substantive rules of law.\n\n“This Court does bend over backwards with pro se litigants to make sure they are treated fairly.\n\nHowever, we cannot bend the rules until they break. Otherwise, our system lacks consistency and\n\nhonesty.” State v. Allen, No. 01C01-9510-CC-00338 (Tenn. Crim. App., Oct. 29, 1996), perm. to app.\n\ndenied, (Tenn., May 12, 1997). The appellant must realize that although he was conducting his own\n\ndefense, given the nature of the charges against him he remained in protective custody and was bound\n\nby certain limitations not endured by an attorney. These limitations would necessarily be more evident\n\nwhen there were heightened security concerns in a case such as this. Accordingly, because of these\n\n\n                                                    43\n\flimitations inherent in his status as a pro se litigant, Carruthers certainly could not exercise all of the\n\nprivileges of an attorney not confined in a jail cell.\n\n\n\n        Carruthers enjoyed the services of a jury selection expert and an investigator who could assist\n\nin any matters Carruthers could not accomplish from the confines of his cell. The appointment of an\n\ninvestigator, however, was not a substitution for counsel. Carruthers remained a pro se litigant.\n\nImmediately prior to the start of trial in April, after a continuance from January, Carruthers requested\n\nadditional time in order to retain counsel. The trial court denied any further continuances. Contrary to\n\nthe appellant’s claim that he was denied sufficient time, we agree with the trial judge that this was\n\nanother in a long line of delay tactics by Carruthers. Furthermore, because Carruthers had the files from\n\nhis previous attorneys, and because the trial was continued three months after he began to represent\n\nhimself, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Carruthers did not have ample opportunity to\n\nprepare his case.\n\n\n                 One of the most fundamental responsibilities of a trial court in a criminal case\n        is to assure that a fair trial is conducted. See, e.g., State v. Burkhart, [541 S.W.2d 365,\n        371 (Tenn. 1976)]. Generally, the trial court, which has presided over the proceedings,\n        is in the best position to make determinations regarding how to achieve this primary\n        purpose, and absent some abuse of the trial court’s discretion in marshaling the trial, an\n        appellate court should not redetermine in retrospect and on a cold record how the case\n        could have been better tried.\n\nState v. Franklin, 714 S.W.2d 252, 258 (Tenn. 1986).\n\n\n\n        Again, there are certain perils a defendant may encounter when he represents himself in a\n\ncriminal trial. Obviously, the better practice would be to proceed with counsel. But as in this case,\n\nwhere the defendant consistently abused his right to counsel and had to proceed pro se, the pro se\n\ndefendant will not necessarily perform as well as an experienced attorney and may invariably make\n\ncertain mistakes. However, this alone is not cause for a new trial. As long as the judge ensures that\n\na fair and impartial trial is conducted, the mistakes and ill-advised strategy decisions are merely\n\nbyproducts of self-representation. We have carefully reviewed each of appellant’s assignments of error\n\nduring trial. The trial judge in this case was extremely understanding and forgiving. This is not to say\n\nthat the trial judge allowed Carruthers to conduct his defense without regard for maintaining orderly\n\nproceedings. While the judge was more lenient in the application of the rules of law, he did not, nor was\n\nhe required to, allow Carruthers free reign in the courtroom. Having completely reviewed the record in\n\nlight of all of Carruthers’ claims in this respect, we find that the appellant was afforded a fair and impartial\n\ntrial. A new trial is not required.\n\n                                                      44\n\f       Carruthers claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. While a criminal\n\ndefendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel, see Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930\n\n(Tenn. 1975), when the defendant waives or forfeits his right to counsel, he also waives or forfeits his\n\nright to the effective assistance of counsel, see State v. Goodwin, 909 S.W.2d 35, 45 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1995). This claim is without merit.\n\nConso lidation of Ind ictments\n\n       Appe llant Carru thers claim s the trial cou rt erred by not requ iring the sta te to\n\nelect upon w hich indictm ents it intend ed to pro ceed u pon at trial. In March 1994,\n\nboth appe llants w ere orig inally indicted on three counts of first degree murder.\n\nSubsequently, in Novem ber 1995, bo th appellants w ere indicted o n three c ounts of\n\nespe cially aggravated kidna pping and o ne co unt of e spec ially aggravated robbery.\n\nAll of these offenses arose from the same criminal episode and involved the same\n\nthree victims . The tria l date in this matter wa s originally schedu led for Februa ry\n\n1995, prior to the return of the second set of indictments. Howe ver, due mainly to\n\nCarruthers’ cond uct reg arding coun sel, the trial wa s eve ntually contin ued several\n\ntimes until the Spring of 1996.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers contends that the murder indictments should have been dismissed.\n\nBecause the state was not forced to elect between the two indictments, according\n\nto the appellant’s argument, he “could not reasonably have known whether he was\n\ndefending murder charges or charges of kidnapping and robbery .” The appellant\n\nfurther claims that if the trial court had followed “normal procedure,” he would have\n\nnever been tried on the murder charges. The state disagrees and asserts that the\n\nappellant was properly tried on all charges.\n\n\n\n        Tenn.R.Crim.P. 8(a) (emphasis added) regarding mandatory joinder of\n\noffenses provides:\n\n\n\n       Two or more offenses shall be joined in the sam e indictm ent,\n       presentm ent, or information, w ith each offense stated in a sepa rate\n       count, or consolidated pursua nt to Rule 13 if the offe nses are based\n       upon the sa me c ondu ct or aris e from the sa me c rimina l episo de an d if\n       such offense s are known to the appropriate prosecuting official at the\n       time of the return of the indictm ent(s), presentm ent(s), or information(s)\n       and if they a re with in the ju risdictio n of a s ingle c ourt. A defen dant s hall\n\n\n                                                  45\n\f        not be subject to sep arate tr ials for m ultiple o ffense s falling within th is\n        subsection unless they are severed pursuant to Rule 14.\n\n\nThe A dvisory C omm ission C omm ents to R ule 8 furthe r provide , in pertinen t part:\n\n\n        This rule is designed to encourag e the disposition in a single trial of\n        multip le offenses arising from the same conduct and from the same\n        criminal episode, and should therefore promote efficiency and\n        economy. Wher e such joinder of o ffenses m ight give rise to an\n        injustice, Rule 14(b)(2) allows the trial court to relax the rule.\n\n        The Commission wishes to make clear that section (a) is meant to stop\n        the practice by some prosecuting attorneys of “saving back” one or\n        more charges arising from the same conduct or from the same criminal\n        episode. Such other charges are barred from future pros ecutio n if\n        known to the appropriate prosecuting official at the time that the other\n        prosecution is commenced, but deliberately not presented to a grand\n        jury.\n\n\n        Carruthers’ argume nt ignores the basic premise behind the Rule.                    The\n\npurpose of Rule 8 is to promote efficient administration of justice and to protect the\n\nrights of the acc used. The ru le clea rly perm its a sub sequ ently returned indictment\n\nto be joined with a previous indictment where the alleged offenses relate to the same\n\ncriminal episode . See King v. S tate, 717 S .W.2 d 306 (Tenn . Crim . App. 1 986). T his\n\npractice, howeve r, does have certain limitations which, as the comments note,\n\nsafeguard an accused against prosecutorial abuse. For example, a prosecutor\n\ncannot simply decide to “save” charges on other offenses arising out of the same\n\nconduct until after a trial is had on the original charges. Obvio usly, th is wou ld resu lt\n\nin multiple trials and prejudice the defendant. This concern, however, is not present\n\nin the case at hand because the subsequent indictments were returned well before\n\nthe sta rt of trial.\n\n\n\n        Although the re is no written trial court order cons olidatin g the in dictm ents in\n\nthis case, not only w as co nsolid ation m anda ted by the rule s, it was clearly\n\nunderstood by the court and all parties involved in this case. As soon as the 1995\n\nindictme nts were re turned, th e appe llants filed a motion to dismiss. After a hearing\n\non December 19, 1995, the trial court denied the motion, and the matter proceeded\n\non all charges. In fact, counsel admitted that they k new th ey wer e going to trial on\n\nthe murder charges; they moved to dismiss the new charges. Carruthers’ claim that\n\nhe did not know what charges the state was prosecuting is wholly without merit. Not\n\n\n\n                                               46\n\fonly did the appe llant file a motio n to dis miss the subsequent charges, which was\n\ndenied, the sty le of the pleadings and orders filed in this case after the return of the\n\n1995 indictments, includ ing letters Carruthe rs wrote to h is attorney , refer to both the\n\n1994 and 1 995 in dictm ents. M oreov er, jury s electio n had alread y starte d in ea rly\n\nJanuary 1996, when the state moved for a continuance. There certainly was no\n\nconfusion as to charges being tried when a jury was again selected and trial finally\n\nbegan three mon ths later in April 1996. A ll of the indictments w ere read to the jury\n\nat the b eginn ing of th e trial.\n\n\n\n       As this Court observed in King,\n\n\n\n       We do not perceive that any evil results from subse quent ind ictmen ts\n       being returned against a defendant charging him with additional\n       offenses which are based on the same conduct or which arise from the\n       same criminal episode upon which prior indictments have been\n       returned; when the defendant has not been tried on any of the offenses\n       at the time the subsequent indictments are return ed. As previo usly\n       noted, the purpose of Rule 8 is to prevent multiple trials on charges\n       arising from the same conduct or from the same criminal episode\n       except under the circumstances stated in the rule.\n\n\n717 S.W.2d at 308 . To follo w the appe llant’s su gges tion in this cas e wou ld resu lt in\n\nthe non-prosecution of three murder charges. Surely this type of windfall was not\n\ncontemplated by the drafters of the Rules. The appellant has simply failed to show\n\nhow he wa s unpre pared to defend on kidnapping and robbery charges that stemmed\n\nfrom the same criminal episode in which three individuals were killed.\n\n\n\nGrand Jury Proceedings\n\n       Carruthers also claims that the murder indictments should have been\n\ndismissed becau se of “the a dmitted ly questio nable tes timony presen ted to the grand\n\njury in suppo rt” of them . Accord ing to Carruthers, the bad faith of the prosecutor by\n\nrefusing to call Alfredo Shaw as a w itness at trial, de spite h aving relied u pon h is\n\ntestimony to sec ure the murd er indic tmen ts, nec essa rily implies that the grand jury\n\nprocess was corrupted. The state denies that the murder indictments are invalid.\n\nThe appellant also cla ims he should have been entitled to the transcript of these\n\ngrand jury proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                            47\n\f       As noted above, Alfredo Shaw testified before the grand jury about the\n\ncircumstances of the murders related to him by Carruthers in jail.                  The state,\n\nhoweve r, indicated that it did not intend to call Shaw as a witness during trial\n\nbecause they had some concerns about his credibility due to criminal conduct after\n\nthe grand jury testim ony. D espite this, Ca rruthe rs him self called Shaw as a witness\n\nand Shaw conveyed to the jury the same information he reportedly told the grand\n\njury. Shaw testified that he previously attem pted to recant h is grand jury testimony,\n\nbut inform ed the jury this was b ecau se his a nd his family ’s safety was threatened by\n\nCarruthers. Accordingly, the “admittedly questionable testimony” the appellant\n\ncomplains about was explained away.\n\n\n\n       Nevertheless, the appellant’s claim must fail. It has long been the rule of law\n\nthat the sufficiency and legality of the evidence presented to a grand jury is not\n\nsubject to judicial rev iew. State v. Gonzales, 638 S.W .2d 841, 845 (Tenn. C rim.\n\nApp. 1982); State v. Northc utt, 568 S.W .2d 636 , 639 (Te nn. Crim . App. 19 78). “[I]f\n\nan indictment is valid on its face, it is sufficient to require a trial to de termin e the g uilt\n\nof the accused regardless of the sufficiency and/or antecedence of the evidence\n\nconsidered by the grand jury.” State v. Dixon, 880 S.W.2d 696, 700 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992). Accordingly, the appellant cannot rely on this claim to challenge the\n\nvalidity of the murder indictm ents. See United States v. Calandra , 414 U.S. 338,\n\n345, 94 S.Ct. 613 , 38 L.Ed.2d 5 61 (1974). As the cases indicate, the proper remedy\n\nfor the app ellant is throu gh a m otion to su ppress the evide nce. See e.g. State v.\n\nCulbre ath and M cCallie , No. 02C01-9805-CR-00145 (Tenn. Crim. App., Mar. 9,\n\n1999) (Rule 11 ap plication pending ) (citing United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 255,\n\n86 S.Ct. 1416, L.Ed.2d 510 (1966)). Here, the evidence the appellant complains\n\nabout would never have been presented to the trial jury if Carruthers himself did not\n\ncall Shaw to the witness stand. This issue is without merit. Also without merit is the\n\nappe llant’s claim that he should have been prov ided a transcript of the grand jury\n\nproceeding in this instan ce. See Rules 1 6(a)(3) an d 6(k), Te nn.R.C rim.P. See also\n\nWes t v. State, 466 S.W .2d 524, 525 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1971 ).\n\n\n\nLetters from Carruthers to Maze\n\n\n                                               48\n\f       Next, Carruthers claims that the trial court erroneously allowed into evidence\n\ntwo letters the a ppellant w rote to Jim my M aze. In the se letters, C arruthers refers to\n\na mas ter plan for ma king m oney . The s tate alle ged th at this p lan involved the\n\nmurder of Marcellos Anderson and the theft of his drugs and money. The appellant\n\nargues that the letters are too vague, have no evide ntiary v alue, a nd are highly\n\nprejud icial.\n\n\n\n       The adm issibility o f evide nce is within the sound discretion of the trial court,\n\nand this Cou rt will not interfer e with that discretion absent a clear showing of abuse.\n\nSee State v. How ard, 926 S.W.2d 579, 585 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996),overruled on\n\nother grounds, State v. Williams, 977 S .W.2 d 101 (Tenn . 1998 ).            Evide nce is\n\nrelevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than\n\nit would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, Tenn.R.Evid. However, relevant\n\nevidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair preju dice, c onfus ion of th e issue s, or m islead ing the jury.\" R ule\n\n403. Of cou rse, sim ply beca use e viden ce is prejudicial does not mean the evidence\n\nmust be excluded as a matte r of law. See State v. Gen try, 881 S.W.2d 1, 6 (Tenn.\n\nCrim. App. 199 3), perm. to app. denied, (Tenn. 1 994).             Th e Cou rt must still\n\ndetermine the relevance of the evidence and weigh its probative value against any\n\nundue prejudice.\n\n\n\n       The appellant argues that the letters are irrelevant because they were written\n\ntoo far in advance of the actual murde rs and d o not refe r to the victims or mention\n\nhow the money would be made. He also suggests that the letters are improper\n\nevidence of othe r crimes or wrongdoings. After a jury-out hearing as to whether\n\nthese letters should be admitted, the trial court made the following findings:\n\n\n\n             But the proof itself, I think, goes directly towa rd esta blishin g this\n       one additional link, one additional factor in establishing, from the Sta te’s\n       perspective, the existence of a conspiracy. It’s very relevant, in my\n       judgm ent.\n\n              It talks about a m aster plan. It talks abou t having the sup port\n       personnel lined up. It talks abo ut having the ma npow er lined up . It\n       talks about “joining with me” and g etting w ith the p rogra m, in effect, and\n\n                                            49\n\f       “get with me when I get out.” And it makes reference to the fact that he\n       is trying to get transferred to MLRC, Mark Luttrell Reception Center,\n       which then ties in to the testimony that Charles Smith gave, which\n       wou ld -- of having overheard some conversations along these line [sic]\n       as we ll.\n\n              You know, again, the jury may not believe any of it, and that’s up\n       to the jury. O r they m ay believ e it all. But it all ties in, a nd it all tie s\n       together. The letters tie in with what Mr. Smith testified to.\n...\n\n             And again, this is additionally why these matters need to be\n       heard during the trial and not pretrial, because I now have the be nefit\n       of havin g hea rd Ch arles Smith’s testimony and having heard other\n       testimony now that Mr. Maze is now on the stand, and I can better\n       judge how his testimony fits in with all of the other testimony.\n\n\n       The trial judge clearly explained how the se letters w ere relev ant to the issues\n\nbeing tried, and having reviewed the transcript of the jury-out he aring, we are\n\nsatisfied that the jud ge did no t abuse his discre tion in adm itting these letters into\n\nevidence. Their probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. This\n\nissue is w ithout me rit.\n\n\n\nStatement of Co-Conspirator\n\n       Next, Carruthers claims that the testimony of Hines relating what Jonathan\n\nMontgo mery told him was inadmissable hearsay. The state counters by arguing\n\nthese statemen ts were adm issible under the c o-conspirator exception to the hearsay\n\nrule. See Tenn.R.E vid. 803(1.2)(E).\n\n\n\n       Hearsay, which is “a statem ent, other than one made by the decla rant w hile\n\ntestifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserte d,” Rule 801(c), is not admissible at trial except as provided by the Rules of\n\nEvidence or otherwise by law. Rule 802. A statement made by a coconspirator of\n\nthe defendant “during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy” is one of\n\nthe exceptions to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(1.2)(E). However, before this type of\n\nhearsay may be admitted, certain conditions must be met: 1) there must be\n\nevidence of a conspiracy involving the defendant and coconspirator; 2) the\n\nstatement must be made during the pendency of the conspiracy; and 3) the\n\nstatement mus t be m ade in the further ance o f the cons piracy. State v. Gaylor, 862\n\nS.W.2d 5 46, 553 (Te nn. Crim. Ap p. 1992).\n\n\n                                              50\n\f      On the nig ht of the murd ers in th is case , Jona than M ontgo mery told Ch ris\n\nHines that they “got them folks out at the cem etery” an d aske d Hines to take him to\n\nthe ceme tery. Hine s refused but allow ed Mo ntgom ery to borrow his car. The next\n\nmorn ing, when the three defendants took Hines to get his car washed, Jonathan\n\nMontgo mery again told Hines they killed some people. The appellant argues that\n\nthe conspiracy in this case ended with the murders, and that these statem ents were\n\nnot during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The state disagrees.\n\nIn its brief, the state argues the first statement by Montgomery was made during the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy because he was seeking a vehicle in which to transport the\n\nvictims to the cemetery. The second statement, the state argues, was made during\n\nthe concealment of the conspiracy, and thus admissible under the same hearsay\n\nexception.\n\n\n\n      In State v. Walker, 910 S.W.2d 3 81, 386 (Te nn. 1995), a case wherein several\n\ndefend ants conspired to rob the victim, who was ultimately killed during the robbery,\n\nour Supreme Court held that a statement by a coconspirator made three or four days\n\nafter the robbery and murde r was ina dmiss ible beca use the consp iracy end ed with\n\nthe commission of the robbery. The Court found that the statement merely related\n\nthe circumstances of the robbery and killing and were not made during a further\n\nconspiracy to conce al the circu mstan ces of the crime. Id. It would follow then that\n\nif there is evidence of a further conspiracy a fter the fact to conceal the crime, any\n\nstatement by a coconspirator made during the course of and in further ance of this\n\nfurther conspiracy may be admis sible aga inst the de fendan t. Id.; see also State v.\n\nHenry, No. 01C01-9505-CR-00161 (Tenn. Crim. App., Feb. 25, 1999) (Rule 11\n\npendin g).\n\n\n\n      In Henry, we no ted tha t a con spirac y to co mm it a crim e did n ot histo rically\n\nextend to steps ta ken to co nceal the crime u nless pro of establish ed that\n\nconcealment furthered the objec tives of the crime. Id. (citing Gaylor, 862 S.W.2d at\n\n554 (where conspiracy to commit murder did not end until victim’s insurance\n\nproceeds were collected )). We also noted that the Supreme Court in Walker did not\n\nexplore the relationship, if any, between the Rules of Evidence and T.C.A. § 39-12-\n\n\n                                           51\n\f103, the cons piracy sta tute, whic h provide s that the c onspira cy includ es efforts to\n\nconceal the crime or to obstruct justice in relation to it. The Court suggested that the\n\ncoconspirator exception to the hearsay rule should be examined under the law as\n\nit existed prior to the enactment of the conspiracy statute because of subsection (g)\n\nof that statute, which p rovides th at “[n]othing in this provis ion is intend ed to m odify\n\nthe evidentiary rules allowing statem ents of co -consp irators in furth erance of a\n\nconsp iracy.”   However, there may be some relationship between the Rules of\n\nEvidence and the criminal s tatute if the de fendan t is specifica lly charge d with\n\nconsp iracy, wh ich is not the case he re. See Henry.\n\n\n\n       The question in this case then becomes whether the statements made by\n\nJonathan Montgomery were made either when the defendants were concealing the\n\nmurders to achieve the objectives of the crimes or duri ng a furth er cons piracy to\n\nconceal the murd ers. To fall under this hearsay exception, the statements by the\n\ncoconspirator must advance in some way the objectives of the conspiracy and not\n\nsimp ly be “casual conversation” about the crime s. State v. Hutchinson, 898 S.W.2d\n\n161, 17 0 (Tenn . 1994).\n\n\n\n       We agree w ith the state that Montgomery’s first statement to Hines falls under\n\nthis hearsay exception. Harris’ Jeep was fo und b urned in Mississippi. The victims\n\nwere buried alive in a cem etery in M emph is. Trial tes timon y indica ted tha t it would\n\nhave taken approximately two people to remove the plywood vault that lined the\n\ngrave site under which the victims were buried. The jury could reasonably have\n\ninferred that when Jo nathan M ontgom ery asked Hines to take him to the cemetery,\n\nthe victims had not yet been buried and Jonathan was needed to assist the other two\n\ndefendants. Moreove r, the jury could have reasonably inferred since Hines’ car was\n\nmuddy when returned that it was taken to the cemetery.                The testimony and\n\nvideotape reveal that the cemetery grounds did contain muddy areas.                  Since\n\nJonathan was n eede d to co mple te the ro bbery , kidna pping s and murd ers, his\n\nstatement to Hines that he killed some folks and needed a ride to the ceme tery\n\nadvanced the conspiracy and w as no t mere ly a na rrative s tatem ent to H ines. W hile\n\nwe find that the sta tement was admissible, we do not agree with the particular\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\fargument the sta te adv ance s in support thereof. Montgomery told Hines, “Man, we\n\ngot them folks out at the cemetery.” Since the victims were allegedly already at the\n\ncemetery, we can not agre e with the state th at the car w as nee ded to transport the\n\nvictims there.\n\n\n\n       Jonathan Mon tgom ery’s n ext sta teme nt alleg edly came after the bodies we re\n\nburied. The state argues that this statement was made during the concealment of\n\nthe conspiracy.     Whether or not the concealment of the crimes furthered the\n\nobjectives of the original conspiracy, there was certainly evidence of a further\n\nconspiracy to conceal the commission of the c rimes . Mon tgom ery co uld have been\n\nconnected to Hines’ car and the mud from Hines’ car could have been traced to the\n\ncemetery where the v ictims were discov ered. T he qu estion , how ever, is whether the\n\nsecond statement furthered in some way the objectives of the conspiracy or was\n\nmere ly a narrative statem ent of pas t condu ct. Apparently, while Montgomery and\n\nHines were standing around waiting for the car wash, Montgomery told Hines they\n\nkilled some people. We do not believe Montgomery made this statement during or\n\nin furthe rance of the c onsp iracy to conc eal ev idenc e of the crime s. It is mo re akin\n\nto “casual conv ersation” about past events and should not have been admitted.\n\nBecause Jonathan M ontgom ery’s first statement w as adm issible, we find, how ever,\n\nthat the erroneous admission of the second statement was harmless. The content\n\nof the sec ond sta temen t mirrored that of the first.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers also claims that he shou ld have been allowed to question Detective\n\nRuby about the content of Jonathan Montgomery’s statements to the police. The\n\nstate argues that this hearsay testimony was properly excluded. In State v. Walker,\n\n910 S.W.2 d 381, 3 86 (Ten n. 1995 ), the Sup reme C ourt held that a c onsp irator’s\n\n“statement to the police can hardly be in furtherance of the conspiracy. It becomes\n\nonly a narrative statement of past conduct between the conspirators.” The Cou rt\n\nnoted, however, that a confession to the police may fall under another exception to\n\nthe hearsay rule, such as a statement against pena l interes t whe n the d eclara nt is\n\nunava ilable. Id. at 385.\n\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\f       In this case, Jonathan Montgomery gave several varying statements to the\n\npolice. At first, he denied knowing anything about the crimes or being present at the\n\nscene. These statements would not fall under this exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn subsequent statements, he stated that he, the two appellants, and Bobby Wilson,\n\na fourth person not identified by any of the witnesses at trial, were all at the scene\n\nof the crime. In one statement, he said Bobby Wilson shot one of the victims but he\n\ndid not know who shot the other (only two of the three victims were shot). Yet, he\n\ninformed the police in another statement that Carruthers and/or Montgomery shot\n\nthe victims.   Since Jonathan Montgomery placed himself at the scene of the\n\nmurders, these late r statem ents do appear to fall under this exception to the hearsay\n\nrule. Tenn .R.Ev id. 804 (b)(3). H owe ver, w e find th e erron eous exclus ion of th is\n\ntestimony to be har mless . See T.R.A.P . 36(b). The state ments clearly im plicate\n\nCarruthers and would have done more harm to his case.\n\n\n\nEvidence of O ther Perpetrators\n\n       Both appellants argue the trial court limited their ability to establish that other\n\npeop le involve d in the Mem phis d rug tra de ha d mo tives to kill the vic tims in this\n\ncase. Again, the adm issibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, and th is Cou rt will not interfere with that discretion absent a clear showing of\n\nabuse. See State v. How ard, 926 S.W .2d 579, 585 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1996 ).\n\nEvidence is relevan t if it has \"any te ndenc y to make the existence of any fact that is\n\nof cons eque nce to the de termin ation o f the ac tion m ore pro bable or less proba ble\n\nthan it would be withou t the ev idenc e.\" Ru le 401, Tenn.R.Evid. However, relevant\n\nevidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair pre judice, co nfusion o f the issues , or mis leadin g the ju ry.\" Ru le\n\n403.\n\n\n\n       As is commonly recognized, an accused is entitled to present evidence\n\nimplicating others in th e crime . See Green v. State, 285 S.W. 5 54 (192 6); Sawye rs\n\nv. State, 83 Tenn. 69 4 (1885); State v. Spurlock, 874 S.W.2d 602, 612-13 (Tenn.\n\nCrim. App. 19 93). Evid ence in s upport o f this third party defense, however, must\n\nconform to the general rules governing the ad missibility of evide nce.          State v.\n\n\n                                           54\n\fMcAlister, 751 S.W.2d 436, 439 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987). The evidence must be the\n\ntype that would be admissible against the third party if he or she were on trial, and\n\nthe proof must be limited to facts inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt. State v.\n\nKilburn, 782 S.W .2d 199 , 204-05 (Tenn. C rim. App. 1989). Accordingly, hearsay\n\nevidence implicating another individual would not be admissible.\n\n\n\n      Having reviewed the record in light of the appellants’ claims, we find that the\n\ntrial court did not exclude any re levant ad missible evidenc e tending to implica te\n\nothers in the murders while exonerating the appellants. The jury was well aware that\n\nMarcellos Anderson was hea vily involved in the dru g trade in Mem phis. The jury\n\nheard evidence about Anderson’s drug dealings with Joh nson a nd Ada ir. The jury\n\nheard that Anderson and Adair had previously been shot by others in drive-by\n\nshootings. They heard that An dre Tu cker, th e broth er of on e of the victims in this\n\ncase, was subsequently killed after the appellants had been arrested on the present\n\ncharges. As the state notes, this evidence clearly suggests that the killings in the\n\ndrug world were still happening. The evidence the appellants refer to was either\n\nhearsay (testimony that Anderson was in debt to Colombian drug dealers) or\n\ncumulative and would have confused the issues and misled the jury (attacks on\n\nothers involved in the M emphis d rug trade). Aga in, the jury knew this case centered\n\naround activities in the drug world and they could reasonably have used their\n\ncommon knowle dge to co nclude that there w ere ma ny playe rs involve d.             The\n\nevidence in this cas e, how ever, p ointed to the g uilt of the appe llants. T his issue is\n\nwithout m erit.\n\n\n\nCompetency of Witness Nakeita Shaw\n\n       Carruthers next claims that the trial court erred by not ordering a competency\n\nevaluation of Nakeita Shaw. Prior to trial, counsel representing Carruthers at the\n\ntime requested an evaluation of Shaw and any records of a history of me ntal\n\ntreatme nt. The sta te indicate d that it had no reco rd of treatm ent. The trial court\n\ndenied the request. During the first jury selection, the state asked for a trial\n\ncontinuance because Shaw had checked herself into a hospital for depression and\n\ncould not appear in court. The court granted the continuance. Carruthers claims,\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\fhoweve r, that this fact should have been a compelling enough reason for the trial\n\ncourt to exercise its inherent power to order a competency evaluation.\n\n\n\n      In support of his claim, Carruthers relies upon State v. Garland, 617 S.W.2d\n\n176 (Tenn. C rim. App . 1981). C arruthers ’ reliance is m isplaced . In Garland, this\n\nCourt specifically held “[t]here is no statutory or case law in Tennessee authorizing\n\na court to compel a prospective witness, not a party interested in the case and\n\npresent only by c ompu lsion of a su bpoen a, to subm it to a psych iatric exam ination.”\n\nId. at 185. The Court further held that the ruling in Forbes v. State, 559 S.W.2d 318\n\n(Tenn. 1977), that the trial court h as the inhere nt pow er to co mpe l a psychiatric or\n\npsychological examination of the victim, was restricted to complaining victims in sex\n\ncases. The Court refused to broaden this holding, and neither of the parties in the\n\ncase before us have cited to any authority which has done so. The case cited by the\n\nappellant involves the physical examination of a complainant in a sex cas e. State\n\nv. Barone, 852 S.W.2d 216 (Tenn. 1993). It clearly appears that the court ordered\n\nexamination of witnesses has been limited to complainants in sex cases, and we do\n\nnot intend to broaden the holding in Forbes any further.\n\n\n\n      Tenn.R.Evid. 601 provides that every person is presumed competent to be a\n\nwitness. The A dviso ry Co mm ission Com men ts to this rule sta te that “[v ]irtually a ll\n\nwitnesses may b e perm itted to testify: ch ildren, mentally incompetent persons,\n\nconvicted felons.” (Emphasis added). Accordingly, any prospective witness may\n\ntestify as long as they have personal knowledg e of the matter a bout which they are\n\ntestifying, Rule 602, and swear they will testify truthfully, Rule 603. The trial judge\n\nhas the discretion to determ ine whe ther a witn ess is co mpete nt to testify. State v.\n\nCaughron, 855 S.W.2d 526, 538 (Tenn. 1993).             This determination will not be\n\ndisturbed on appea l absent a n abus e of discre tion. State v. How ard, 926 S.W.2d\n\n579, 584 (Tenn . Crim. App. 19 96) (overruled o n other grounds). In Garland, this\n\nCourt h eld:\n\n\n\n       A lunatic or a person adjudged insane is competent as a witness if, at\n       the time he is offered as a witness, he has sufficient unders tanding to\n       comprehend the obligation of an oath and capable of giving a correct\n\n\n                                            56\n\f       account of the matters which he has seen or heard in reference to the\n       questions at issue.\n\n\n617 S.W.2d at 184.\n\n\n\n       Desp ite the above-cited authority, the state claims Carru thers h as wa ived th is\n\nissue 1) by not renewing his request for a mental examination of Shaw before she\n\ntook the witness stand and 2) by failing to question her on cross-examination about\n\nher hospitaliza tion. See T.R.A.P . 36(a). We agree. Since the trial court did not\n\nhave the authority to orde r a mental ev aluation of Sha w, and be cause C arruthers\n\nfailed to preserve the issue, this matter has been waived. Regardless, even if Shaw\n\nhad been found to be mentally incompetent, she could have testified as long as she\n\nwas able to understand the obligation of an oath and had personal knowledge of the\n\nmatter to which she testified . See Caugh ron, 855 S.W.2d at 538. The trial judge\n\nappa rently determined that she was comp etent acc ording to the law to testify, and\n\nthere is nothing in the rec ord to s ugge st he a buse d his d iscretio n. This issue is\n\nwithout m erit.\n\n\n\nPhotographic Evidence\n\n       Both appellants claim that the videotape and photographic evidence of the\n\ncrime scene and de cease d victims were irrele vant, cum ulative, highly prejudicial and\n\nerron eous ly admitted to inflame the passion of the jury. They claim this evid ence did\n\nnot assist the jury in identifying the perpetrators and was cumulative of the oral\n\ntestimony of the witnesses. Furthermore, the appellants argue the evidence shou ld\n\nnot have been shown to the jury because the appellants offered to stipulate to the\n\nfact that the victims were found bound in the grave site.\n\n\n\n       The admissibility of relevant photographs and videotapes of the crime scene\n\nand victims is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and his or her ruling on\n\nadmis sibility will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of\n\nthat discretion. State v. Banks, 564 S.W .2d 947 , 949 (Te nn. 197 8). See also, State\n\nv. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797, 807 (Tenn. 1994); State v. Van Tran, 864 S.W.2d 465,\n\n477 (Tenn. 1993 ). More over, th e mo dern tr end is to ves t more discre tion in the trial\n\n\n                                            57\n\fjudge 's rulings on admis sibility. See Banks, 564 S.W .2d at 949 ; State v. Bailey,\n\n01C01-9403-CC-00105 (Tenn. Crim. App., Nashville, July 20, 1 995); perm. to app.\n\ndenied, (Tenn. Jan. 8, 19 96).\n\n\n\n      Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact\n\nthat is of conse quenc e to the de termina tion of the a ction more probable or less\n\nproba ble than it would be without the evide nce.\" Rule 401, T enn.R.Ev id. Howeve r,\n\nrelevant evidence \"may be exclud ed if its pr obativ e valu e is sub stantia lly outweighed\n\nby the danger of unfair prejudice, confus ion of the iss ues, or m isleading the jury.\"\n\nRule 403. Of course, simply because evidence is prejudicial does not mean the\n\nevidence must b e exclud ed as a matter o f law. See State v. Gen try, 881 S.W.2d 1,\n\n6 (Tenn.. Crim . App. 1993 ). The court mus t still determine the relevance of the\n\nvisual evidenc e and w eigh its probative value against any undue prejudice. Along\n\nthese lines, the trial court should be guided by the following matters in determining\n\nthe adm issibility o f releva nt vide otape and p hotog raphic evidence: the accuracy and\n\nclarity of the picture and its value as evidence; whether the picture depicts the body\n\nas it was found; the adequ acy of tes timonial e vidence in relating the facts to the jury;\n\nand the need for the evidence to establish a prima facie case of guilt or to rebut the\n\ndefend ant's con tentions. Banks, 564 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n\n\n      Contrary to the assertion of the appellants, the identity of the perpetrators was\n\nnot the on ly issue in this case. The s tate also had to p rove to the jury the existence\n\nof the ele men ts of all the offenses. The video shows the location of the grave site\n\nand the efforts to conceal the presence of the bodies. The trial court limited the\n\nnumber of still pho tograp hs, bu t allowe d in seve ral to show the restraints on the\n\nvictims. As the s tate observes, the trial judge in this case was very conscientious\n\nin his review of the admission of the photographic evidence. The evidence was\n\nrelevant to the state’s case and assisted the jury in its finding that the state proved\n\neach element of the offenses. We do not find that the evidence was cumulative or\n\nundu ly prejudicial. Moreover, the admissibility of photograp hic evidence does not\n\ndepend upon the defendant’s offer to stipulate to the facts depicted therein,\n\nespe cially when the prosecution does not agree to the stipu lation. See State v.\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fSchafer, 973 S.W .2d 269 , 274-75 (Tenn. C rim. App . 1997); State v. Griffis , 964\n\nS.W.2d 577, 59 5 (Tenn . Crim. App. 1997) (“an accused cannot marshal the\n\nevidence of the state by simply offering to stipulate to a fact for the purpose of\n\nbarring the state from introducing admissible, demonstrative evidence the accused\n\ndoes not want the jury to see”). The trial court did no t abus e its disc retion in this\n\ncase, the refore, this iss ue is witho ut merit.\n\n\n\n       Montgo mery also challenges the introduction of photographs of the victims\n\nbefore they were murdered. The appellant cites State v. Dicks, 615 S.W .2d 126,\n\n128 (Tenn. 1981). However, in State v. Nes bit, 978 S.W.2d 872, 901-02 (Tenn.\n\n1998), the Supreme Court adopted that portion of this Court’s opinio n whic h held\n\nthat a photograph of the victim while alive was relevant to the state’s case-in-chief\n\nin proving that the person murdered was the same person name d in the ind ictmen t.\n\nWe find this evidence was not cumulative and was properly admitted.\n\n\n\nSentencing on Non-capital Offenses\n\n       Carruthers next contends that he was denied his right to be present at the\n\nsentencing hearing on the robbery and kidnapping convictions and he, therefore,\n\nreques ts a new senten cing hea ring. The state claim s he wa ived his righ t.\n\n\n\n       The trial judge originally scheduled the non-capital sentencing hearing for May\n\n20, 1996.    However, because of some confusion regarding transportation, the\n\nappellan ts were not brought to Memphis from the Riverbe nd Ma ximum Security\n\nFacility outside of Nashville. At this point, the court had already appointed counsel\n\nto represent Carruthers at the hearing on the m otion for ne w trial a nd on appe al.\n\nThe court reset the sentencing hearing for M ay 28, an d inform ed cou nsel for bo th\n\nappellan ts of this continuance . On May 28, the court decided , becau se of sec urity\n\nconcerns, that the sentencing hearing would be held at Riverbend the next day. The\n\ncourt again info rmed Carruthers’ counsel of this change, and stated that although\n\nthey could ap pear, the y would not have an active role in the h earing. The record\n\ndoes n ot reflect, ho weve r, whethe r the app ellants w ere pers onally no tified.\n\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\f      On May 29, the trial judge, along with the prosecutors and counsel for\n\nMontgomery, appeared at Riverbend for the hearing. Just prior to the start of\n\nproceedings, the warden informed the judge that Carruthers said he was not going\n\nto participate . The appellants were apparently located in a different area of the\n\nprison than where the hearing took place. Counsel for Montgomery also informed\n\nthe judge that Montg omery was su rprised the hearing was go ing to take place and\n\nthat he, too, was not going to p articipate. Counsel stated that Montgomery was not\n\ngoing to participate becaus e of the presen ce of the me dia. The judge , however,\n\nrefused to exclude the media from the proceeding. The judge again asked the\n\nwarden to inquire wheth er Carru thers wa nted to be presen t. Carruthers, how ever,\n\ngave no reason other than to say he was not going to participate. The judge then\n\ndecided he was going to proceed without the presence of either appellant since they\n\nhad volun tarily elected to remain away. T he judg e stated th at the app ellants knew\n\nthis hearing was going to take place, however, he admitted they may have been\n\nsurprised about its location.\n\n\n\n      T.C.A. § 16-1-105 (1998 supp.) provides that\n\n\n\n      If for any caus e, in the op inion o f the co urt dee med sufficie nt, it is\n      impracticable or inconv enient for a ny cou rt to hold its se ssion at the\n      courthouse , or place design ated by law, it sha ll be lawful for the court\n      to hold its sess ion, or a ny pa rt of its se ssion , at any other ro om w ithin\n      the limits of the county seat, or at any other room op en to th e pub lic\n      within an institution of the department of correction or the department\n      of children’s services if the court deems it necessary, and all its\n      proceedings at such place, whether in civil or criminal cases, are as\n      valid as if done at the courthouse.\n\n\nThe trial court determined that it was necessary for security reasons to hold the\n\nsentencing hearing on the non-capital offenses at the prison outside Nashville. The\n\nroom used in the prison was open to the public, as the media w as there, and th ere\n\nappea rs to be no error in the tria l court’s judg ment in this respe ct.\n\n\n\n       Criminal defen dants have the righ t to be p resen t at all sta ges o f the trial,\n\nincluding sentencing. T enn.R.Crim .P. 43(a). See also State v. Muse, 967 S.W.2d\n\n764, 766-67 (Tenn. 1 998). Th is right, however, may be wa ived. Ru le 43(b); Muse,\n\n967 S.W.2d at 767-68 (citing State v. Kirk, 699 S.W.2d 814 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n                                            60\n\f1985)). “An accused who has notice of the time and place of the trial and of his right\n\nto attend, and who nonetheless voluntarily absents himself, will be deemed to have\n\nwaived his right to be prese nt.” Kirk, 699 S.W.2d at 819. Rule 43 also provides that\n\na defen dant c an wa ive his right to appear if, after present initially, he “[v]olun tarily is\n\nabsen t after the trial ha s com menc ed.”\n\n\n\n       In Muse, a case discussing whether or no t a defendant may waive the right\n\nto be presen t during jury voir dire, our Supreme Court acknowledged that there is a\n\nlong-standing presumption against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\n\n967 S.W.2d a t 767. The C ourt held that waiver would not be presumed from a silent\n\nrecord, and that in orde r for a de fenda nt to w aive h is or her right to be present during\n\nvoir dire, the defendant must personally waive the right in writing or on the record in\n\nopen court. Id. at 768. In Muse, the trial court rescheduled the jury selection at\n\ncoun sel’s request, but the d efendant w as personally unaware of this. When jury\n\nselection began a day earlier than originally scheduled, the defendant did not\n\nappear. The Sup reme C ourt remanded for a new trial because the defendant was\n\nnot informed of the rescheduling.\n\n\n\n       In this case, the trial judge admitted Carruthers may not have known that the\n\ncourt planned on visiting the prison. However, the judge stated that both ap pellants\n\nwere aware that a sentencing hearing was going to occur. In fact, the hearing had\n\norigina lly been scheduled the week prior in Memphis. The judge also made the\n\nfollowing comments for the record:\n\n\n\n              Obviously, since there has already been a thorough sentencing\n       hearing back in April, on April 26th, at the time that Mr. Montgomery\n       and Mr. Carruthers were found guilty by the jury on the murder charges,\n       the -- all three sides in the case, the state and both defendants, had an\n       opportu nity to present any and all proof they cared to at that time, w ith\n       regard to sentencing issues. . . . And so I would assume that all three\n       parties involved at that sentencing hearing would have presented any\n       and all relevant proof that they had available to them at that time with\n       regard to sentencing issues in this case.\n       ...\n              Now, on Mr. Carruthers’ behalf, since he’s not represented by\n       coun sel, it had been my intention to addres s him in c ourt toda y to see\n       if there was any additional proof that he wanted, that he perhaps was\n       missing out on since the matter was being held here. Since he has not\n       graced us with his presence, I haven’t h ad the o pportun ity to address\n       him today.\n\n                                              61\n\f       After makin g the latter c omm ents, the judge took a short recess to allow\n\ncounsel to confer with Montgomery and to allow the warden to inform Carruthers that\n\nthis was his opportu nity to ma ke a state ment o n his ow n beha lf, if he so chose.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery returned from their conference and again informed the\n\njudge that Montgo mery was o bjectin g to this hearin g bec ause it was n ot bein g held\n\nin a pub lic place . Coun sel spe cifically s tated th at, to the ir knowledge, they would not\n\nhave called any a ddition al witne sses at this h earing .       The w arden once again\n\ninformed the judge that Carruthers declined to participate. The warden made at\n\nleast three attempts during the hearing to secure Carruthers’ presence.\n\n\n\n       Given that the re had previo usly been an ex haus tive se ntenc ing he aring in this\n\ncase, the trial judge stated that he did not believe there would be any additional\n\nevidence presented by defen se tha t wou ld not have been cumulative. Of course, as\n\nprovided by the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, both the state and the\n\ndefendant have the right to pres ent relevant evidence at the sentencing hearing.\n\nSee T.C.A . §§ 40 -35-2 03(a) ; 40-35 -209( b). This includes the opportunity for the\n\ndefendant to make a statement on his ow n beha lf. § 40-35-2 10(b)(6) . Cf. State v.\n\nStephenson, 878 S.W.2d 530, 550-52 (Tenn. 1994) (capital defendant not allowed\n\nallocution during capital sentencin g hearing). The trial court, however, would have\n\nbeen perm itted to e xclud e any evide nce th at had alread y bee n pres ented earlier in\n\nthe proceedings. § 40-35-209(b). Similarly, in imposing the sentences for the\n\nkidnapping and robbery convictions, the judge was required to consider anything\n\nalready in the record from the trial to date, including evidence from the capital\n\nsenten cing hea ring. § 40-3 5-210.\n\n\n\n       Counsel for Montgomery indic ated they were not aware of any additional\n\nwitnesses. And w hile the judge thoug ht it was highly unlike ly Car ruther s wou ld\n\nproduce any, the judge was willing to allow Carruthers the opportunity to present any\n\nadditional proof as well as make a statement on his own behalf. The record is silent\n\nas to whether Carruthers possessed any additional proof.                 If Carruthers had\n\nappeared at the hearing and requested a continuance so that he could forewarn any\n\nrelevant witnesses they would need to travel to Nashville, the trial court could have\n\n                                             62\n\fgranted a continuanc e. Howe ver, because we believe Carruthers waived his right\n\nto be pre sent, there was no error by th e trial court in th is respec t.\n\n\n\n       The facts of this case ca n readily be distingu ished from those in Muse. In\n\nMuse, beside not knowing about the change in dates, the defendant did not appear\n\nin court on the day tria l comm enced . Cf. State v. Robinson, No. 03C01-9512-CR-\n\n00410 (Tenn. Crim. App., July 16, 1997).            In the case at hand, although the\n\ndefendant may not have known about the change in time and place of the hearing,\n\nthe defendant was given every opportunity to appear before the judge at the prison.\n\nThis is not a case where the trial judge was going to proceed without even making\n\nan effort to secure the presence of the defendant. The defendant was housed in the\n\nsame facility where the hearing took place, and the warden informed him on at least\n\nthree separate occasions that the judge was going to proceed without him if he\n\nchose not to appea r. Carruthers did n ot personally appear before the judge and\n\nwaive his right to be presen t. Howeve r, the record before us clea rly reflec ts that th is\n\nwas his intention. We believe this scenario is akin to the situation where a defendant\n\nis initially present in the courtroom and then “[v]oluntarily is absent after the trial has\n\ncomm enced .” See Rule 43. Carruthers obviously knew the sentencing hearing was\n\nabout to begin but voluntarily chose not to participate. Given the discussion above,\n\nwe find that Carruthers waived his right to be present at the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\n\n       Both appellan ts claim the prosec utors m ade im proper a rgume nts during b oth\n\nphas es of th e trial w hich re quire a rema nd for a new tr ial.\n\n\n\n       As is commonly recognized, closing arguments are an important tool for the\n\nparties during the trial process. Consequently, the attorneys are usually given wide\n\nlatitude in the sco pe of their a rgume nts, see State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797, 809\n\n(Tenn. 1994 ), and tr ial judg es, in tu rn, are acco rded w ide dis cretion in their control\n\nof those ar gume nts, see State v. Zirkle , 910 S.W.2d 874, 888 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1995).     Such s cope a nd discre tion, how ever, is no t comp letely unfe ttered.\n\nArgument must be temperate, based upon the evidence introduced at trial, relevant\n\n\n                                             63\n\fto the issues being tried, and not otherwise improper under the facts or law . Coker\n\nv. State, 911 S.W.2d 357, 368 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). The test for determining\n\nwhether the prosecuting attorney committed reversible misconduct in the argument\n\nis “whether the improper conduct could have affected the verdict to the prejudice of\n\nthe defend ant.” Harrington v . State, 385 S.W.2d 758, 759 (Tenn. 1965). The\n\nfollowing factors have been recog nized to aid th e Cou rt in this determination: 1) the\n\nconduct complained of, viewed in light of the facts and circumstances of the case;\n\n2) the curative measures undertaken by the court and the prosecutor; 3) the intent\n\nof the prosecutor in making the improper statement; 4) the cumulative effect of the\n\nimproper cond uct an d any other e rrors in the record; and 5) the relative strength or\n\nweak ness o f the case . State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797, 809 (Te nn. 199 4); State\n\nv. Buck, 670 S.W .2d 600, 609 (Tenn. 198 4).\n\n\n\n       Initially, Carruthers claims that because he was representing himself the trial\n\ncourt should have taken a more active role in guarding against prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct during argument.        As we noted earlier, there are certain perils a\n\ndefendant faces when repres enting hims elf at trial. Know ing whe n to object during\n\nargument obviously is one of those perils. While the trial court can intervene sua\n\nsponte and take cu rative meas ures whe n the argum ent becom es blatantly impro per,\n\nsee, e.g., State v. Cau thern, 967 S.W.2d 726, 737 (Tenn. 1998), the trial court must\n\nexercise its discretion and should not exert too much control over the arguments.\n\nThe judge does not serve as a pro se defendant’s counselor during trial. The judge\n\nshou ld intervene only when requested or when the judge deems proper in the\n\ninterest of justice.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers refers to several instances of allegedly improper argument that\n\noccurred during the guilt pha se of the trial. He claims the prosecutor imp roper ly\n\ncharacterized him as a conniver and liar and accused him of manipulating the jury.\n\nEvidence was introduced that Carruthers was the mastermind behind these crimes,\n\nand therefore, any referenc e by the s tate in this regard wa s not improp er. Howev er,\n\nthe prosecutor may not comment unfavorably upon the defendant’s pro se\n\nrepresentation of himself or the presen tation of his c ase. See Coke r v. State, 911\n\n\n                                          64\n\fS.W.2d 357, 368 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). Nor should a prosecutor express his or\n\nher personal opinion about the credibility of witnesses, un less the com ments are\n\ngrounded upon evidence in the rec ord. See State v. West, 767 S.W.2d 387, 394\n\n(Tenn. 1989). M oreove r, a prosecutor is strictly prohibited from commenting on the\n\ndefen dant’s decision not to testify. Coker, 911 S.W.2d at 368. This would include\n\nhis decision not to pres ent any proof. How ever, a prose cutor's statement that proof\n\nis unrefuted or uncontradicted is not an improper comment upon a defendant's\n\nfailure to testify. State v. Thomas, 818 S.W .2d 350, 364 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1991 );\n\nState v. Coury, 697 S.W.2d 373, 378 (Tenn. Crim. A pp. 1985). The prosecutor\n\nshou ld also refrain from calling the defen dant de rogatory name s. State v. Cauthern ,\n\n967 S.W .2d 726, 737 (Tenn. 199 8).\n\n\n\n      In this cas e, it was improper for the prosecutor to call the appellant names,\n\nsuch a s a liar. However, we do not find improp er the co mm ents telling th e jury to\n\nwatch out for “pitfalls” and “mind games” and not to succumb to a “guilt trip.” The\n\nprosecutor was simply making reference to the strength of the state’s proof. Also,\n\nthe prosecutor should not have insinuate d that Ca rruthers w as trying to manip ulate\n\nthe jury or comment that Carruth ers did no t call any cre dible witne sses on his beha lf.\n\nContrary to Carru thers’ claim , howe ver, we d o not be lieve thes e com ments\n\nimpro perly referred to Carruthers’ failure to testify. Similarly, Carruthers complains\n\nabout the prosecutor’s statements that Carruthers was trying to manipulate the\n\nmedia. Howe ver, Alfred o Shaw testified abo ut this. Moreo ver, the sta te is permitted\n\nto argue reasonable inferences from th e evid ence in the reco rd. Coker, 911 S.W.2d\n\nat 368. The sta te’s argume nt in this respect wa s not improp er. Carruthers also\n\nclaims the state’s reference to the “second part” of Carruthers’ master plan\n\nmentioned in the letters he wrote to Maze was improper. Since this was brought up\n\nby the ev idenc e, we do no t think th is comm ent w as improper.        Carruthers also\n\nclaims the prosecu tor’s statement to the jury that they have a responsibility to the\n\nvictims’ family improperly appealed to the emotions and sympathies of the jury. See\n\nState v. Bigbee, 885 S.W .2d 797, 809 (Tenn. 199 4). We agre e. Finally, Carruthers\n\ncontends the prosecutor’s comment that there is a “gap” in the evidence was\n\nimproper. Carru thers c laims this wa s an im prope r inferen ce on his failure to testify.\n\n\n                                            65\n\fWe disagree. The state’s case was based on circumstantial evidence and the\n\nprose cutor’s comment in this respect merely informed the jury that not all the pieces\n\nto the p uzzle were prese nted a t trial.\n\n\n\n       Both appellants complain about certain comments made by the prosecutor\n\nduring argument at the penalty phase of trial. Both appellants take issue with the\n\nprose cutor’s mentio n of the ten comm andm ents in the Bible. Just recently, in State\n\nv. Middlebrooks, 995 S.W.2d 550, 559 (Tenn. 1999), our Supreme Court made the\n\nfollowing comm ent rega rding this typ e of argu ment:\n\n\n\n              We have condemned Biblical and scriptural references in a\n       prose cutor’s closing argument so frequently th at it is difficult not to\n       conclude that the remarks in this case were made either with blatant\n       disregard for our decisions or a level of astonishing ignorance of the\n       state of law in this regard.\n\n\nThis argument by the prosecutor was obviously improper under the decisions of our\n\nSupre me C ourt.\n\n\n\n       Both appellants also contend that the state made improper victim impact\n\nargum ent.    Victim impact evidence and argument during sentencing are not\n\nprohibited by the co nstitution o r statute. See State v. Nes bit, 978 S.W.2d 872 (Tenn.\n\n1998). Howe ver, the arg umen t must be relevant to the spec ific harm to the vict im’s\n\nfamily , Middlebrooks, 995 S.W.2d at 558, and must be limited to “information\n\ndesigned to show those unique characteristics which provide a brief glimpse into the\n\nlife of the individual who has been killed, the contemporaneous and prospective\n\ncircumstances surrounding the individual’s death, and how those circumstances\n\nfinancially, emotionally, psychologically or physically impacted upon members of the\n\nvictim ’s family.” Nesb it, 978 S.W.2d at 891 (footno te om itted). Th e “victim ’s fam ily\n\nmembers’ characterization and opinion about the crime, the defendant, and the\n\napprop riate sentence v iolates the Eighth A mendm ent.” Id. at 888 n.8 . Again, the\n\nprosecutor cann ot sim ply ap peal to the em otions and s ymp athies of the ju ry wh ile\n\ninvoking victim impact argum ent. Id. at 891 (citing State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797\n\n(Tenn. 1994)).     We agree with the appellants that the prosecutor im properly\n\ncommented that the family members who testified did not cry and had remained\n\n                                            66\n\fquiet during trial. Also improper was the comment that the families “trust in you [the\n\njury].”    The family m embers could have testified that they missed the victims\n\n(emotional impact of victim’s d eath), and the comment by the prosecutor that they\n\nchose no t to solicit this testimony wa s not improp er.\n\n\n\n          Montgo mery also claims that the prosecutor improperly asserted his personal\n\nopinion into closing argument. While a prosecutor may not express a personal\n\nopinion or belief, comments during argument prefaced by phrases such as “I think”\n\nor “I subm it” are unlike ly to be ad judged opinions . Coker v. State, 911 S.W.2d 357,\n\n368 (Tenn. C rim. App . 1995).        A ccording ly, we do not believ e the com ments\n\nMontgomery complain a bout which contain these phrases w ere improp er.\n\nMontgomery asserts that the prose cutor improp erly read to the jury a d ictionary\n\ndefinition of the term “mitigate” and improperly asked the jury to use that definition\n\nto determine whether any mitigating evidenc e was p resente d.              Acco rding to\n\nMontgomery, the prosecutor erroneously told the jury that mitigating evidence is that\n\nwhich mitigates the crime , rather tha n that wh ich mitiga tes the pu nishm ent.\n\nAlthough the prosecutor may have not clearly provided the jury with the legal\n\nmeaning of mitigation , the trial judge prope rly instru cted th e jury a nd the jury is\n\npresumed to have fo llowed th ose instru ctions. State v. Cribbs, 967 S.W.2d 773, 784\n\n(Tenn. 1998). Finally, we agree with the state that the death penalty statute does\n\nnot limit the state’s final closing argument to rebutting that which the defendant\n\nargued. T.C .A. § 39-13-20 4(d).\n\n\n\n          We find that the appellants have waived any cha llenge reg arding th e majo rity\n\nof the comments about which they complain because they failed to voice a\n\ncontemporaneous objection. T.R.A.P. 36 (a); see also State v. Little, 854 S.W.2d\n\n643, 651 (Te nn. Crim . App. 19 92). Non etheless , we hav e review ed the e ntire\n\nargum ents of all parties, and considering the factors listed above, we find that the\n\nrelative ly few improper comments by the prosecutors did not affect the verdict to the\n\nprejudice of the appellants.       This issue is without merit.    However, we remind\n\ncounsel of the warnings recently related by our Supreme Court in State v.\n\nMiddlebrooks, 995 S.W .2d 550 , 561 (Te nn. 199 9):\n\n\n                                             67\n\f              Those who interpret these cases as precedent for the view that\n       improper closing argume nt and m iscon duct o f this na ture w ill be he ld\n       harmless error in all cases do so at their own professional peril and at\n       the risk that the misconduct, even if it does not prejudicially affect the\n       verdict, may be deemed to be prejudicial to the judicial process as a\n       whole a nd there fore requ ire a new trial or sente ncing he aring.\n\n\n\nGag Order\n\n       Next Carruthers claims the trial court erred by issuing a gag order before the\n\nstart of trial.   Carruthers contends the gag order, which prevented any of the\n\nattorneys or pro se litigants from making extra-judicia l statements about the case,\n\nadversely affected his ability to present a defense. Specifically, Carruthers claims\n\nthat the order may have prevented an important witness from coming forward.\n\n\n\n       On March 4, 1996, the trial court issued an order as follows:\n\n\n\n               The Constitutions of the United States and the State of\n       Tennessee guarantee defendants in all criminal cases due process of\n       law and the right to a fair an d impartial jury. It is the duty of the trial\n       court to see that every defendant is afforded all his constitutional rights.\n               In order to safeguard those rights, this Court is of the opinion that\n       the following rule is necessary to constitutionally guarantee an ord erly\n       and fair trial by an impartial jury. Therefore, this Court orders the\n       following:\n               All lawyers participating in this case , including a ny defe ndants\n       proceeding pro se, the assistants, staff, investigators, and employees\n       of investiga tors are for bidden to take par t in interview s for pub licity and\n       from makin g extra-jud icial statem ents ab out this ca se from this date\n       until such time as a verdict is retu rned in this case in o pen co urt.\n               Because of the gravity of this case; because of the long history\n       of concerns for the personal safety of attorneys, litigants and witnesses\n       in this case; because of the potential danger - believed by this Cou rt to\n       be very real and very present - of undermining the integrity of the\n       judicial system by “trying the case in the media” and of sullying the jury\n       pool, this Court feels compelled to adopt this extraordinary pretrial\n       measure. State v. Hartman , 703 S.W .2d 106 ([Tenn.] 1985), and State\n       v. Green, 783 S.W .2d 548 ([Ten n.] 1990).\n\n\n       Much of the procedural history of this case has been outlined previously,\n\nincluding the numerous threats to attorneys and the death of one of the co-\n\ndefendants. As Carruthers acknowledges in his brief, “[t]his trial was charge d with\n\nemotion from start to finish.       There were allegations of gang affiliations and\n\ntestimony of large scale narcotics dealings.           The courtroom was guarded by\n\nS.W.A.T. team mem bers a nd by Sher iff’s deputies who w ere auth orized to search\n\nthose entering the cou rtroom.” Furthermore, as the trial judge stated in a n in came ra\n\n\n                                             68\n\fhearing during the middle of trial on April 20, 1996, a deputy jailer had been gunned\n\ndown in the jailer’s driveway the day before and the judge expressed concerns that\n\nthere might be a connection to this case. He also noted that one witness fled and\n\ncould not be found after reading about this case in the newspaper. Further, the\n\njudge indica ted tha t two w itnesses who already testified stated that appellant\n\nMontgo mery threatened to kill them if they talked about this case. Alfredo Shaw\n\neven testified that Carruthers tried to make arrangements to have Shaw recan t his\n\ntestimony in front of the media.\n\n\n\n       This case was the subject of another interlocutory appeal to this Court,\n\nwhe rein we he ld that the trial court’s gag order on the media precluding them from\n\nprinting the nam e of a witness who already testified was an unconstitutional prior\n\nrestra int.   State v. Mon tgomery , 929 S.W.2d 409 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996).\n\nAccordingly, the m edia was not exclud ed from these pr oceed ings and was free to\n\nreport anything about the case, including the events that transpired in the courtroom.\n\nThe gag order at issue here was directed at the attorneys, including the pro se\n\nlitigant. The trial court properly concluded that there was no problem prohibiting the\n\nattorneys or their representatives from speak ing abo ut the cas e. State v. Hartman,\n\n703 S.W .2d 10 6, 116 (Tenn . 1985 ).         The tw ist in this c ase, h owe ver, is that\n\nCarruth ers wa s repres enting him self during trial.\n\n\n\n       As we stated earlier, “one of the most fundamental responsibilities of a trial\n\ncourt in a crim inal ca se is to a ssure that a fa ir trial is conducted.” State v. Fran klin,\n\n714 S.W.2d 252, 258 (Tenn. 1986).            And while prior restraints o n speech are\n\ngene rally suspe ct, see, e.g., State v. Mon tgomery , 929 S.W.2d 409 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996), there are instances where the exercise of free speech mus t yield to the\n\nmost fundament of all freedo ms, the right to a fair trial. See The News-Journal Corp.\n\nv. Foxman, 939 F .2d 14 99, 15 12 (11 th Cir. 1 991).          T he righ t to a fair tria l is\n\nguaranteed, not only to the accused, but also to the state as the representative of\n\nthe people. See, e.g., United States v. Ford, 830 F.2d 596, 603 (6th Cir. 1987)\n\n(Krupansky, J., concurring). Carruthers cites United State v . Ford, which provides\n\nthat there m ust ex ist a “cle ar and prese nt dan ger” be fore a tr ial cou rt may impose\n\n\n                                             69\n\fa prior restraint on a cr imina l defen dant’s spee ch du ring trial. Other federal circuits,\n\nhowever, apply a lower standard when evaluating restrictive orders imposed upon\n\ncriminal defendants; that is, whether there is a “reasonable likelihood” that a fair trial\n\nwill be lost ab sent the re striction on speec h. See The News-Journal Corp., 939 F.2d\n\nat 1515 n.18.\n\n\n\n       Regardless of which standard is applied in this case , we agre e with the state\n\nthat there was at least a spe cific clea r and p resen t dang er that a n unfa ir trial wo uld\n\noccur if the speech of the defendant was not curtailed. Since this case garnere d\n\nsubstantial med ia atten tion in the Memphis a rea, the trial judg e was rightly\n\nconcerned about the media ’s influence on the po tential jury pool. The trial judge\n\nremarked about the several media interviews given by Carruthers, his investigators,\n\nas well as one of the prosecutors. Furthermore, as demonstrated through the\n\ntestimony of Shaw, Carruthers appa rently threatened Shaw and made arrange ments\n\nthrough one of his investigators to have a news reporter interview Shaw about\n\nrecanting his story. Obviously, if a criminal d efenda nt is allowe d to ma nipulate the\n\nwitnesses and media during trial, the guarantee of a fair trial is nonex istent. Aside\n\nfrom this, as already made evident, the trial judge was also properly concerned\n\nabout the safety of all involved. The order was specifically drawn to curtail the\n\nparticular dangers of an unfair trial in this case. That is, the judge did not want any\n\nattorney, staff member, investigator or pro se litigant to have any exchange with the\n\nmedia. Given the entire record of proceedings in this case, we find no problem with\n\nthe trial court’s ga g order. See Pedini v. Bowles, 940 F.Supp. 10 20 (N.D.Te x. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. Hill, 893 F.Supp. 1039 (N.D.Fla. 1994). Moreover, although\n\nappa rently not considered by the trial judge, we do not believe there were any\n\nreason able altern atives to th e gag o rder. See, e.g., The News-Journal Corp., 939\n\nF.2d at 1513 n.16.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers’ main co mplain t about the gag order is that he may have been\n\nprevented from discovering the presence of an otherwise unknown witness. Again,\n\nthe med ia was given free rein to cov er the p rocee dings at trial. The public was\n\ncertain ly aware of what was going on, and we do not believe an interview by\n\n\n                                             70\n\fCarruthers would have produced different results than were achieved with the\n\nexistent media coverage. Accordingly, even if the gag order was invalid, given the\n\nnature of Car ruther s’ com plaint, it d id not a ffect the fairnes s of the trial.\n\n\n\nSeverance\n\n       Montgo mery claims the trial court erred in denying his motions to sever the\n\ntrial of the tw o defe ndan ts. Spe cifically, h e claim s he w as un duly p rejudic ed in th is\n\njoint trial b ecau se ce rtain statements by Carruthers would not have been admitted\n\nagainst him in a separate trial and because of the manner in which Carruthers\n\nrepresented himself at trial. The state contends the trial court acted properly.\n\n\n\n       The decision wheth er to gran t a motion to sever defendants lies within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless\n\nthe movin g party w as clearly prejudice d. State v. Hutchison, 898 S.W.2d 161, 166\n\n(Tenn. 1994).      A motion to sever may be granted before trial if “it is deemed\n\napprop riate to prom ote a fa ir determination of the guilt or innocenc e of one or m ore\n\ndefend ants.” Tenn.R .Crim.P . 14(c)(2)(i). A motion to sever made during trial may\n\nonly be granted when the defend ant to be s evered conse nts and it is necess ary to\n\nachieve a fair determination of guilt. 14 (c)(2)(ii). Befo re a defe ndant is e ntitled to\n\na reversal, the record must show that the “‘defen dant w as clea rly prejudiced to the\n\npoint that the trial court’s discretion ended and the granting of [a] severance became\n\na judicial duty.’” State v. Burton, 751 S.W .2d 440, 447 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1988 ).\n\n\n\n              “It may have been to the interest of each [defendant] that he be\n       tried alone, but the orders of the court are molded to protect rights, and\n       not merely the interests, of persons accused of crime. The state, as\n       well as the persons accused, is entitled to have its rights protected, and\n       when several perso ns are charged jointly with a single crime, we think\n       the state is entitled to have the fact of guilt determined and punishment\n       assessed in a single trial, unless to do so would unfairly prejudice the\n       rights of the defend ants.”\n\n\nState v. Coleman, 619 S.W .2d 112, 116 (Tenn. 198 1) (quoting Woo druff v. Sta te, 51\n\nS.W.2d 8 43, 845 (Te nn. 1932)).\n\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\f      Montgo mery conten ds that lette rs Carru thers wr ote to Jim my M aze, a\n\nstatement Carru thers m ade to Jona than M ontgo mery in Maze’s presence, and the\n\nstatem ents of Jonathan Montgomery to Chris Hines would not ha ve be en ad miss ible\n\nagainst him in a separate trial because the evidence was insufficient to establish a\n\nconspiracy at the time the state ments were made.            We disagree.     We have\n\nprevio usly discussed the two statements by Jonathan Montgomery to Chris Hines\n\nand found that the first statement was properly admitted under the co-conspirator\n\nexception to the hearsay rule.        The proof at trial clearly connected James\n\nMontgomery to Hines’ car. We also believe, contrary to Montgomery’s insistence,\n\nthat Carruthers’ letters and statements to Jimmy Maze would have properly been\n\nadmitted against M ontgom ery und er this sam e exce ption to the hearsa y rule. W e\n\nprevio usly stated that the trial court properly admitted these letters into evidence\n\nagainst Carruthers. And while the letters do not specifically mention Montgomery,\n\nother evidence introduced at trial clearly connected Montgomery to Carruthers’ plan.\n\nIn fact, while Carruthe rs and Jonathan Montgomery were riding around with Maze\n\nin December 1993, Carruthers mentioned that the y wou ld nee d to wa it until James\n\nwas released from prison before kidnapping Anderson. And although the state must\n\nshow the existence of a conspiracy in o rder to introduce h earsay of a co -conspirator,\n\nthe trial judge may permit independent proof of a conspiracy after the admission of\n\nthe hearsa y eviden ce. State v. Hodgkinson, 778 S.W.2d 54, 61 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1989) (citing Solomon v. State, 76 S.W.2d 331 (Tenn. 1934)). However, even if the\n\nletters and statements to Maze would not have been adm issible against Mo ntgome ry\n\nin a sep arate tr ial, the error w as harm less in this c ase. State v. Hutchison, 898\n\nS.W.2d 161, 16 7 (Tenn . 1994). T he evide nce wa s otherw ise sufficien t to sustain the\n\nconvictions of Montgomery.\n\n\n\n      Similarly, Montgomery also insists that Charles Ray Smith could not have\n\noverheard Carruthers and Montgomery discuss the conspiracy when Marcellos\n\nAnderson returned Carruth ers to priso n from fu rlough because the prison records\n\nreflect that Carruthers did not take furlough after Montgomery was transferred to the\n\nMark Luttrell Reception Center. However, the records do reflect that Carruthers,\n\nMontgo mery and Sm ith were all hou sed a t the sa me tim e in the Reception Center\n\n\n                                           72\n\fduring the early part of November 1993. Moreover, Andre “Baby Brother” Johnson\n\ntestified that Smith warned him and Anderson to watch out for Carruthers and\n\nMontgomery. Both Johnson and Terrell Ad air were also pre sent when Montgom ery\n\nand Carruthers mentioned they had so meone already targeted . Also, Montgo mery\n\ntold Adair th at if the p olice d id not h ave a body , there c ould b e no c rime. T his\n\nmatched statements attributed to Carruthers. Accordingly, Montgomery’s complaint\n\nin this re spec t mus t fail.\n\n\n\n         Montgo mery further claims a severance should have been granted because\n\nthe manne r in which Ca rruthers conduc ted his defen se pre judice d Mo ntgom ery’s\n\ncase. Montgomery complains about Carruthers’ mannerisms in front of the jury as\n\nwell as a few of the que stions he asked some witness es. He also suggests that\n\nAlfredo Shaw w ould not have been called to te stify against him in a s eparate trial\n\nand the fact tha t Carruth ers called him to testify u nduly prejudiced his case because\n\nit was “so me of th e mos t dama ging evid ence o f the entire trial.”\n\n\n\n         When two defend ants are on trial toge ther, there will invariably be evidence\n\nadm issible against one that would otherwise not be admissible against the other.\n\nThis factor alone, however, does not preclude the state from going forward in a trial\n\non two or m ore defe ndants . In cases wh ere evidence would be admissible against\n\none defendant but not the other, the trial court may properly instruct the jury that they\n\nare only to co nsider the evidenc e adm issible aga inst each defend ant sep arately. In\n\nthe present case, although certain evide nce, s uch a s Alfred o Sha w’s testimony, may\n\nnot have been admissible against Montgomery, the trial court in this case instructed\n\nthe jury that each appellant was “entitled to have their cases decided on the\n\nevidence and the law which is applicable to them.” The jury is presumed to have\n\nfollowed the cour t’s instruction . State v. Little , 854 S.W.2d 643, 648 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992). However, even if the trial judge in this case should have excluded\n\nShaw ’s testimony or severed the trials, given the other convicting evidence\n\nintroduced, we do not believe Montgomery was unfairly prejudiced by Carruthers’\n\nquestioning of Shaw . See State v. Hutchison, 898 S.W.2d 161, 166-67 (Tenn.\n\n1994).\n\n\n                                            73\n\f       Furthermore, counsel or a p ro se litigan t has a n oblig ation o nly to represent\n\nthe interests o f his or her c lient or him or herse lf. See State v. Brown, 644 S.W.2d\n\n418, 421 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982). Similarly, counsel or a pro se litigant has no\n\nobligation to protect th e interests of a co-de fendan t. Id. In fact, it is permissible for\n\none defendant to attempt to place the blame during trial on his or her cod efenda nt.\n\nSee State v. Ensley, 956 S.W .2d 502 , 509 (Te nn. Crim . App. 19 96). Each defendant\n\nhas discretion to develo p his or he r own trial strategy. Having reviewed each of\n\nMon tgom ery’s com plaints regard ing the man ner in w hich C arruth ers ha ndled his\n\ncase, we do not believ e Carru thers’ con duct viola ted Mo ntgom ery’s rights so as to\n\nwarrant a severa nce or a mistrial. See id. Accordingly, for the reasons stated\n\nherein, this issue is w ithout me rit.\n\n\n\nTestimony of Benton West and Nakeita Shaw\n\n       Montgo mery next claims that the court improperly allowed hearsay testimony\n\nby Benton West and failed to give limiting instruction s rega rding N akeita Shaw ’s\n\nprior incon sistent state ment.\n\n\n\n       At trial West testified that Nakeita Shaw told him she thought Anderson and\n\nTucker were being kid nappe d and th at she ho ped no thing hap pened to them. The\n\nfirst statement, that Shaw thought the victims were being kidnapped, was solicited\n\nduring the prosecutor’s direct examination of West. The second statement was\n\ninitially solicited during Montgomery’s cross exam ination. Both statem ents were\n\nhearsay, however, neither Carruthers nor counsel for Montgomery voiced an\n\nobjection. Accord ingly, we find that this e rror has b een w aived. T.R .A.P. 36(a);\n\nState v. Walker, 910 S.W.2d 381, 386 (Tenn. 1995). Moreover, when there is no\n\ncontemporaneous objection to a hearsay statement, the jury may consider it as\n\nevidence and give the testimony such weight as it dee ms pro per. See State v.\n\nBenn ett, 549 S.W .2d 949, 950 (Tenn. 197 7).\n\n\n\n       Shaw testified that she moved to Milwaukee after the police investigation\n\nbegan because she had received a death threat. While she stated that these thre ats\n\ndid not come from James Montgomery, she did testify that James Mon tgom ery told\n\n\n                                            74\n\fher that sh e cou ld be c harge d as a n acc omp lice in this case.              Shaw gave a\n\nstatement to the Milwaukee Police wherein she said Anderson and Tucker were\n\nescorted out of her house with their hands tied behind their backs. At trial, while\n\nreiterating that she was still afraid for her life, s he tes tified tha t she d id not s ee the ir\n\nhands bound in any manner. Montgomery claims Shaw’s earlier statement to the\n\npolice was a prior inconsistent statement that should have only been admitted for\n\nimpeachment purposes, not for the truth of the matter asserted.                     No limiting\n\ninstruction was requested or given. The state argues in response that the prior\n\nstatement by Shaw was admissible to help explain to the jury, in light of her\n\ntestimony that she was still afraid for her life, why her trial testimony differed from her\n\nstatement to the police.\n\n\n\n       Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses can only be offered to impeach a\n\nwitness’ credibility, no t for the truth o f the ma tter asserte d. State v. Reece, 637\n\nS.W.2d 858, 861 (Tenn. 1982). However, where there is no contemporaneous\n\nrequest for a limiting instruction, the error of the trial court cannot later be attacked\n\non appeal. T.R.A .P. 36(a). Mon tgomery c orrectly asserts, how ever, that the failure\n\nby a trial court to issue a contemporaneous curative instruction for prior inconsistent\n\nstatements, even in the absence of a special request, could, under some\n\ncircumstances, constitute reversible error: \"[when] the impeaching testimony is\n\nextrem ely damag ing, the need for the limiting instruction is appa rent, and the failure\n\nto give it results in sub stantial pre judice to th e rights of th e accu sed.\" Reece, 637\n\nS.W.2d at 861. In Reece, the Suprem e Court also s tated that the review ing court\n\nshou ld consider the overall strength of the state’s case in deciding whether the\n\nfailure to instru ct con stitutes revers ible error. Id. Since Shaw testified on the stand\n\nthat the victims’ hands were not tied when they left her house, there should have\n\nbeen an instruction regarding her prior inconsistent statement to the police.\n\n\n\n       We do not agree with the state’s argument that the prior inconsistent\n\nstatement was properly admitted to explain Shaw’s trial testimony. To allow the\n\nadmission of Shaw’s statement to the police for the truth of the matter asserted\n\n\n\n\n                                               75\n\f“wou ld be to hold that hearsay evidence not under oath took precedence over\n\nevidence given by the same witness unde r oath and on the witness stan d.” Id.\n\nHowe ver, considering the nature of the statement in light of the other evidence,\n\nincluding the fact that the bodies we re discovered with their hands bound, as well as\n\nthe strength of the state’s case, albeit predominantly based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, we do not believe the failure to give a contemporaneous instruction\n\nresulted in substan tial prejudice to Mon tgome ry. This claim is without m erit.\n\n\n\nTestimony of Terrell Adair, Andre Johnson and Chris Hines\n\n      Montgo mery also claims that certain testimony by these three witnesses was\n\nerroneo usly allow ed by the trial court. Th e state dis agrees .\n\n\n\n      The prosecutor asked Adair if he was present during a conversation between\n\nCharles Ray Smith, Marcellos Anderson and Andre Johnson about their personal\n\nsafety. Adair stated he was and then the prosecutor asked Adair what Smith said.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery objected claiming the answ er called fo r hearsa y. After a\n\nbench conference, the trial court sustained the objection but allowed the prosecutor\n\nto ask Adair if the conve rsation too k place. The prosecutor then asked the following\n\nquestion: “Mr. Adair, without telling us what Mr. Smith said, was there a conversation\n\nregarding their personal sa fety between Charles R ay Smith a nd Mr. An dre Johnson\n\nand Marcellos A nderson? ” Montgom ery claims on appeal that this question was an\n\nimprop er use o f a prior con sistent state ment.\n\n\n\n      We find that the appellant has waived this issue, however, we also disagree\n\nwith the app ellant’s claim . Counsel objected to the question at trial because it called\n\nfor hears ay. The trial court sus tained the objection . Couns el, howe ver, failed to\n\nvoice an objection based on the use of a prior consistent statement. Accordingly,\n\nhe wa ived any challeng e to the alle ged erro r. T.R.A.P . 36(a); State v. Walker, 910\n\nS.W.2d 381, 38 6 (Tenn . 1995). See also State v. Matthews, 805 S.W.2d 776, 781\n\n(Tenn. Crim. A pp. 199 0) (a defe ndant “m ay not litigate an issue on one ground,\n\nabandon that ground post-trial, and assert a new basis or ground for his contention\n\nin this Court”). Regardless, we do not believe this is a situation where a witness was\n\n\n                                           76\n\fimpro perly questioned about a prior consistent statement. The witness was not\n\ntestifying about a prior statem ent he m ade, rath er he w as testifying about a\n\nconversation that took place between three other individuals. While it may have\n\nbeen h earsay , we do n ot find any other erro r in the testim ony in this re spect.\n\n\n\n      Montgo mery also complains about a portion of Andre Johnson’s testimony.\n\nAt one point, the prosecutor asked Johnson if he had a talk with Anderson about\n\nCarruthers and Montg omery. Johnson responded: “I had a talk to Marcellos and\n\nTerre ll Adair. I told th em, ‘Look, do not ride James and Tony in a car with you\n\nbecause a friend of mine was in jail with them to ld them people --.’” Counsel for\n\nMontgo mery immediately objected and the judge told the witness that he could not\n\nrepeat what so meon e else sa id to him. The prosecutor then asked Johnson what\n\nhe told Adair and Anderson, and Johnson answered: “I told them, ‘Don’t ride James\n\nand Tony in the car with you because they out to rob you and kill you.’” Mon tgomery\n\nnow claim s this was an improper use of a prior statement. For the same reasons we\n\ndiscussed above in relation to Adair’s testimony, we find that the appellant has\n\nwaived this claim.     Nevertheless, we do not believe this constituted a prior\n\nstatem ent. This was the first time Johnson was asked about what he told Anderson\n\nand Adair, therefore, there was no other state ment, either con sistent or inc onsisten t,\n\nbefore the jury.\n\n\n\n      Montgo mery alleges that the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to question\n\nChris Hines about a prio r statement. The appellant claims there was no basis for\n\nthis line of que stioning. H ines wa s ques tioned by the pros ecutor a nd then both\n\nappellan ts cross examined him. During redirect, in an attempt to rehabilitate the\n\nwitness, the prosecutor questioned Hines about a statement he gave to the police.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery objected to this line of questioning stating that it went\n\nbeyond the scope of cross examination.           The trial judge made the following\n\ncomments in overruling the objection:\n\n\n\n              Everything he asked about, though, relates to the subject matter\n       that has been covered in this state ment. Qu estions were asked about\n       the car wa sh, wh o was hed it, h ow it was washed, who cleaned out the\n       trunk, what the circumstances were, what the circumstances were\n\n                                           77\n\f       when he talked to Jonathan, what the circumstances were when he\n       talked to James and Tony, how many phone calls were made, when\n       they were made, how they w ere mad e. Eve rything that is re lated to in\n       this statement that’s being used on redirect was covered on cross by\n       both of you-a ll. And if he ge ts into areas in this statement that go\n       beyond what was covered on cross, certainly your objection would be\n       sustained. As long as the areas in this statement that he is covering\n       pertain to the areas that you-all covered on cross, I’m going to ove rrule\n       the objection.\n\n\nWe a gree w ith the trial court’s ruling and find no error in this line of questioning by\n\nthe state on redire ct. See State v. Tizard , 897 S.W.2d 732, 746 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1994); State v. Meeks, 867 S.W.2d 361, 374 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). This claim,\n\ntherefore , is also with out me rit.\n\n\n\nOpinion Testimony\n\n       Montgo mery claim s that C hris H ines sh ould n ot hav e bee n allow ed to g ive his\n\nopinio n of wh at Mo ntgom ery m eant w hen h e told Hines that a rifle had blood on it.\n\nMontgo mery cites Tenn. R. Evid. 701, which provides that a lay witness’s “testimony\n\nin the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which\n\nare (1) rationally based upon the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear\n\nunderstanding of the witness’s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” He\n\nargues that H ines’ int erpre tation had no fou ndatio n of fac t and w as no t rationa lly\n\nbased on his pe rception. In response, the state contends that Hines was not being\n\nasked to give his opinion as to w hat M ontgo mery mea nt, but to expla in why Hines\n\nrefused to accep t the wea pon.\n\n\n\n       At the trial, the state asked Hines w hat hav ing blood on the w eapon mean t to\n\nhim, and he responded tha t it mea nt that s ome body had b een s hot w ith it. At this\n\npoint, Montg omery objected “as far as w hat it mea nt to” Hine s, but the trial court\n\noverrule d the ob jection.\n\n\n\n       To the extent that the testimony was presented to show Hines’ interpretation\n\nfor the purpose of explaining Hines’ rejection of the weapon, we believe the evidence\n\nwas inadm issible bec ause it w as who lly irrelevant to the issue s on trial. See Tenn.\n\nR. Evid. 401, 402. To the extent that the testimony could be taken as evidence of\n\nwhat Montgomery meant by saying that the weapon “had blood on it,” we believe\n\n                                            78\n\fthat the record provides insufficient foundation to justify the admission of Hines’\n\ninterpretation. If a phrase is not common parlance and carries a particular meaning\n\nin a partic ular context or environment, the witness to such meaning should lay a\n\nfoundation that show s that the w itness ha s the spe cialized kn owledg e need ed to\n\nassist the jury su bstantially to understand the evidence. Tenn. R. Evid. 702. Such\n\nwas not done in this case.\n\n\n\n       Howe ver, we conclude that any error was harmless. We do not believe that\n\nthe jury was at undue risk because of Hines’ opinion, given the fact that they already\n\nknew that Montgomery said that the weapon had blood on it. Such is also true in the\n\ncontext of all of th e rem aining evide nce in this case . The de fendan t does no t specify\n\nany particu lar preju dice th at mo re prob ably than not affected the verdict and we find\n\nnone in our review of the record.\n\n\n\nJury Instructions\n\n       Montgo mery claims the trial court’s jury instruction on the especially heinous,\n\natrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance was improper. He claims that the use\n\nof the phrase “in that” instead of “and” - the murder is especially heinous, atrocious\n\nor cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse - sugg ested to the jury\n\nthat all acts of torture or serious physical abuse are automatically classified as\n\nheinous, atrocious or crue l. This very argument has recently been rejected by our\n\nSupreme Court.        See State v. Nesbit, 978 S.W .2d 872, 887 (Tenn. 199 8).\n\nAcco rdingly , this claim mus t fail.\n\n\n\n       Montgo mery also claims that the trial court improp erly instructed the jury\n\nregarding mitigating evidence.          Specifically, he claims the trial court erred by\n\ninstructing the jury that it should not distinguish between statutory and any requested\n\nnon-statutory mitigating circumstances and by instructing the jury on sta tutory\n\nmitigating circumstances that were not supported by the record. The trial judge\n\ninstructed the jury on mitigating evidenc e acco rding to the statute in existence at the\n\ntime. T.C.A. § 39-13-203(e) (1991). The appellant seems to suggest that the “no\n\ndistinction” aspect of the instruction prejudiced him because he did not request an\n\n\n\n                                              79\n\finstruction on any non-sta tutory circumsta nce. How ever, since there were no non-\n\nstatutory circumstances requested, the jury did not have anything to distinguish.\n\nAccord ingly, we do not be lieve the a ppellant w as prejud iced by th is instruction .\n\n\n\n       Montgo mery further claims that the judge erred in instructing the jury on all of\n\nthe statutory mitigating circumstances even though they were not all supported by\n\nthe record.    According to the appellant’s argument, this undermined his actual\n\nmitigation and emphasized to the jury the number of circumstances missing from the\n\ncase. The Supreme Court has recognized that only those mitigating circumstances\n\nraised by the ev idence should b e instructe d. See State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d 253,\n\n267 (Tenn. 1993). The Court has also held, however, that any such error in th is\n\nrespect does not require reversal unless the appellant can show prejudice. Id. The\n\nappellant claims, d espite the Supre me C ourt’s ruling on this issue, that instructing\n\non all of the circumstances does not benefit him. Again, absent a showing of\n\nprejudice, this claim m ust fail. See State v. Nes bit, 978 S.W.2d 872, 902 (Tenn.\n\n1998) (adopting the portion of this Court’s opinion addressing this issue). The\n\nappellant has failed to show how he was prejudiced by the instruction. Accordingly,\n\nthis issue is without m erit.\n\n\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Both appellan ts challen ge the su fficiency of th e conv icting evide nce. A g uilty\n\nverdict by the jury, approved by the trial court, accredits the testimony of the\n\nwitnesses for the state and resolves all conflicts in favor of the state's theory. State\n\nv. Hatche tt, 560 S.W .2d 627 , 630 (Te nn. 197 8); State v. Grace, 493 S.W.2d 474,\n\n476 (Tenn. 197 3). On appeal, \"the state is entitled to the strongest legitimate view\n\nof the trial evid ence and a ll reasonable or legitimate inferences which may be drawn\n\ntherefrom .\" State v. Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d 832, 835 (Tenn. 1978). This Court does\n\nnot reweigh or reevaluate the evidence . Id. The ju ry's ve rdict, the refore , will only\n\nbe disturbed if, after a consideration of the evidence in the light m ost fav orable to the\n\nstate, a rational trier of fact could not have found the essential elements of the crime\n\nbeyond a reasonable dou bt. Jack son v . Virginia , 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781\n\n(1979); State v. Williams, 657 S.W .2d 405, 410 (Tenn. 198 3); T.R.A.P. 13 (e).\n\n\n                                            80\n\f       A criminal offense may be proven through direct evidence, circumstantial\n\nevidence, or a combination of the two. State v. Tharpe, 726 S.W.2d 896, 899-900\n\n(Tenn. 1987). See also State v. Brown, 836 S.W.2d 530, 541 (Tenn. 1992)(“the\n\ncases have lon g recog nized tha t the nece ssary ele ments of first-degree murder may\n\nbe shown b y circumstan tial evidence”). Before the defendant may be convicted of\n\na criminal offense based upon circumstantial evidence alone, the facts and\n\ncircumstances \"must be so strong and cogent as to exclude every other re ason able\n\nhypo thesis save the guilt of the de fendan t, and that b eyond a reas onable doubt.\"\n\nState v. Crawford , 470 S.W.2d 610, 612 (Tenn 1971). \"A web of guilt must be\n\nwoven around the defendant from which he cannot escape and from which facts and\n\ncircumstances the jury could draw no other reasonable inference save the guilt of\n\nthe defe ndant b eyond a reaso nable d oubt.\" Id. at 613.\n\n\n\n       At the time of this offense, first degree murder was defined as \"an inte ntiona l,\n\npremeditated and deliberate killing of anothe r.\" T.C.A. § 39-13-202(a)(1) (1991) (the\n\ncurrent first degree murder statute does not require proof of deliberation). Once a\n\nhomicide has been proven, it is presumed to be a second-degree murder and the\n\nstate has the b urden o f establishin g prem editation a nd delibe ration. State v. Brown,\n\n836 S.W.2d 530 (Tenn. 1992). Intentional is defined as \"the conscious objective or\n\ndesire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.\"                  T.C.A. § 39-11-\n\n106(a)(18)(19 91).    Premeditation necessitates \"the exercise of reflection and\n\njudgment,\" T.C.A. § 39-13-201(d) (1991), requiring \"a previously formed design or\n\nintent to kill.\"   State v. West, 844 S.W.2d 144, 147 (Tenn. 1992).             Whereas\n\ndeliberation is defined as a “cool purp ose,” “without pa ssion or provo cation.” § 39-\n\n13-201 (b)(1) and comm ents (19 91).\n\n\n\n       The elements of premeditation and deliberation are questions for the jury and\n\nmay be inferred from the circums tances surroun ding the k illing. State v. Bland, 958\n\nS.W.2d 651, 660 (Te nn. 1997). The Supreme Court has delineated several relevant\n\ncircumstances which may be indicative of premeditation and deliberation, including\n\nthe use of a d eadly w eapon upon a n unarm ed victim , the fact that the k illing was\n\nparticu larly cruel, declarations by the defen dant o f his inte nt to kill, and the making\n\n\n                                            81\n\fof preparations before the killing for the purpose of conc ealing the cr ime. Id. This\n\nCourt has also noted several factors from which the jury may infer these elements:\n\nfacts about what the appellant did prior to the killing which would show planning;\n\nfacts about the appellant's prior relationship with the victim from which motive may\n\nbe inferred; an d facts ab out the na ture of the k illing. State v. Bord is, 905 S.W.2d\n\n214, 222 (Te nn. Crim . App.), perm. to app. denied, (Tenn. 1995 ) (citing 2 W. LaFave\n\nand A. S cott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law § 7.7 (1986)).\n\n\n\n       At the time of the crimes, especially aggravated robbery was defined as the\n\nintentional or knowing theft of property from the person of another by violence or\n\nputting the person in fear, accomplished with a deadly weapon and whe re the vict im\n\nsuffers seriou s bod ily injury . T.C.A . § 39-1 3-403 (1991 ). Espe cially aggravated\n\nkidnapping was the knowing removal of confinement of another unlawfully so as to\n\ninterfere substantially with the other’s liberty, accomplished with a deadly weapon\n\nor where the victim suffers serious bodily injury. T.C.A. § 3 9-13-305 (1 991).\n\n\n\n       The trial evid ence is thoro ughly outline d abo ve. Ha ving re viewe d the p roof in\n\nthe record in the ligh t mos t favora ble to the s tate, w e find th at a ratio nal jury could\n\nreaso nably have fou nd the a ppellants guilty of all cha rges. Again, convictions may\n\nbe based solely on circums tantial evide nce an d all ques tions rega rding cre dibility of\n\nwitnesses are res olved by the jury. Th is issue is witho ut me rit. Furth ermo re, wh ile\n\nnot addressed by either appellant, we have examined the evidence and have found\n\nthat the proof was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstances found by the\n\njury and that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonab le doubt. T.C.A . § 39-13-206 (c)(B)-(C) (1991 ).\n\n\n\nDeath P enalty Statu te\n\n       Both appellan ts challen ge the co nstitutiona lity of Tenn essee ’s death p enalty\n\nstatute. All of the num erous claim s raise d by th e app ellants have repea tedly been\n\ndenied by our S uprem e Cou rt. See, e.g., State v. Burns, 979 S.W.2d 276 (Tenn.\n\n1998) (adopting this C ourt’s review o f this issue); State v. S mith, 893 S.W.2d 908\n\n(Tenn. 1994); State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 74 (Tenn. 1994). Accordingly, these\n\n\n                                             82\n\fclaims must fail. Carruthers also claims that the recent amendment to T.C.A. § 40-\n\n23-114 (1998 Supp.), which allows those capital case defendants who committed\n\ntheir offense prior to January 1, 1999, to elect to be put to death by lethal injection\n\nconstitutes an uncon stitutional de legation o f legislative a uthority. W e disagree. The\n\nstatute clearly states that this class of offenders shall be put to death by\n\nelectrocution. The s tatute, h owe ver, giv es the offend er the o ption to waive this\n\nmethod of exe cution and e lect leth al inject ion ins tead. T his is not a delegation of the\n\nlegisla ture’s autho rity. This claim is without m erit. At any rate, this statute does not\n\naffect the appellants’ convictions or sentences.\n\n\n\nProportionality Review\n\n       Pursuant to T.C.A. § 39-13-206, this Court must consider whether the\n\nsentence of death was im pose d in an arbitrar y fash ion an d whe ther the sente nce is\n\nexcessive or dispropo rtionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Interestingly,\n\nneither appellant has addressed the proportionality review in their appellate briefs.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently issued the following mandate in order to assist the\n\nappellate courts in fulfilling their statutory duties:\n\n\n       the State and the defendant in each case must fully brief the issue by\n       spec ifically identifying those similar cases relevant to the comparative\n       proportio nality inquiry. W hen ad dressing proportio nality review , the\n       briefs of the p arties s hall conta in a section setting forth the nature and\n       circumstances of the crimes that are claimed to be similar to that of\n       which the defenda nt has been convicted, including the statutory\n       aggravating circumstances found by the jury and the evidence of\n       mitigating circumstances . In addition, the parties shall include in the\n       section a discussion of the character and record of the defendants\n       involved in the crim es, to the e xtent asce rtainable from the Rule 12\n       reports, appellate cou rt decisions, or records of the trial and sentencing\n       hearings in those cases.\n\n\nState v. Bland, 958 S.W .2d 651, 667 (Tenn. 199 7) (emphasis added) (internal\n\nfootnotes omitted). The Bland opinion was issued we ll before the appe llate record\n\nwas filed in this case.\n\n\n\n       In Bland, the Su prem e Cou rt outlined the proce ss ap pellate courts shou ld\n\nemploy when conducting a comparative proportionality review. The review required\n\nis not a rigid, objective test, id. at 668 , nor are the co urts bo und to cons ider on ly\n\nthose case s in wh ich exa ctly the same aggravating circumstances have been found,\n\n                                             83\n\fState v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 84 (Te nn. 199 4). It is the duty of the app ellate\n\ncourt, not to “assure that a sentence less than death was neve r impo sed in a case\n\nwith similar character istics,” b ut to “as sure th at no a berra nt dea th sen tence is\n\naffirmed .” Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 665. With respect to the circumstances of the\n\noffense, we con sider: 1) the mean s of death ; 2) the manner of death; 3) the\n\nmotivation for the killing; 4) the place of death; 5) the simila rity of the victims’\n\ncircumstances including age, physical and mental conditions, and the victims’\n\ntreatment during the killing; 6) the absence or presence of premeditation; 7) the\n\nabsence or presence of provocation; 8) the absence or presence of justification; and\n\n9) the injury to a nd effects on non deced ent victim s. With re spect to comparing the\n\ncharacter of the de fenda nts, the followin g facto rs are re levan t: 1) the d efend ant’s\n\nprior criminal record or prior criminal activity; 2) the defendant’s age, race, and\n\ngender; 3) the defendant’s mental, emotional or physical condition; 4) the\n\ndefendant’s involvement or role in the murder; 5) the defen dant’s co operatio n with\n\nauthorities; 6) the defendant’s remorse; 7) the defendant’s knowledge of\n\nhelplessness of victim(s); and 8) the defendant’s capacity for rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n       The facts and circumstances o f the offe nses in this ca se ha ve be en tho rough ly\n\ndetailed above.    The three victims were kidnapped and ultimately buried alive.\n\nBefore being placed in the ground, two of the victims were shot and one was beaten\n\nwith a shovel. The appellants knew their victims: Marcellos Anderson, twenty-five\n\nyears of age; his mother, Delois Anderson, in her forties; and F rederick Tuc ker,\n\nseventeen years old. The appellants w ere both twenty-six years of age at the time\n\nof the mu rders. Bo th appe llants claim they are innocen t of the crim es. As the\n\npresentence reports indicate, both appellants have extensive prior criminal records,\n\nincluding crimes of violence to the person.\n\n\n\n       While no two cas es are th e sam e, the follow ing case s wher e the de ath\n\nsentence was imposed contain similar characteristics to the present one: In State\n\nv. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d 808 (Tenn . 1985 ), the tw enty-e ight ye ar old defendant shot\n\nand slit the throats of the two victims and left them to die in the woods during an\n\n\n\n\n                                            84\n\falleged ly botched drug deal. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: the\n\nmurder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the murder was committed\n\nduring the course of a robbery. In State v. S mith, 868 S.W.2d 561 (Tenn. 1993), the\n\nforty year old defendant was convicted on three counts of the premed itated murde rs\n\nof his estranged wife and her two sons. The victims were shot and stabbed in their\n\nhome. There was also evide nce th at the d efend ant ha d prev iously threatened the\n\nvictims. The defendant presented an alibi defense at trial. The jury found four\n\naggravating circumstances for two of the victims (the murder was especially heinous,\n\natrocious or cruel; the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding arrest or\n\nprosecution; the murder was committed during the commission of a felony; the\n\ndefendant committed mass murder) and two for the third victim (the murder was\n\nespe cially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the defendant committed mass m urder).\n\nIn State v. Burns, 979 S.W.2d 276 (Tenn. 1998), the young defendant was convicted\n\nof felony murder and sentenced to death. The defendant and his accomplices\n\napproached four young m en sitting in a car, robbed th em, a nd killed two of them.\n\nThe jury found one aggravator, that the defendant created a risk of ha rm to two or\n\nmore persons. In State v. Mo rris, No. 02C01-980 1-CC -00012 (Tenn. C rim. App .,\n\nFeb. 5, 1999) (appeal to Supreme Court pending), the thirty-eight year old defendant\n\nwas convicte d on two counts of premeditated first degree murder and senten ced to\n\ndeath. The defendant intended to rob his neighbors for drug money. The two\n\nvictims were the male neighbor and his minor cousin-in-law. The defendant also\n\nkidnapped and raped the wife of the male victim. The jury found two aggravating\n\ncircumstances: the murde r was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the\n\nmurder was committed during the course of a first degree murder, rape, burglary or\n\nkidnapping. We are convinced that the result in the case before us was neither\n\ndisproportionate nor arbitrary.\n\n\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we affirm the appellants’\n\nconvictions and sentences. Because this case will automatically be reviewed by the\n\nSupreme Court, w e will not se t a date of e xecution .

WOODALL, JUDGE\n\f                                   OPINION\n       The appellan ts, Jame s Mon tgomery and Tony Carruthers, were each indicted,\n\nalong with their co-defendant, Jonathan Montgomery, on three counts of the\n\npremeditated first degree mu rders of Ma rcellos Ande rson, h is mo ther, D elois\n\nAnderson, and Frederick Tucker. Prior to trial, Jonathan Montgomery was found\n\nhanged in his jail cell. James Mo ntgome ry and Ton y Carruthers were also indicted\n\non three counts e ach of the esp ecially aggravated kidnapping of all three victims,\n\nand one count each of the especially aggravated robbery of Marcellos Anderson.\n\nThe appellants w ere tried and co nvicted on ea ch charge . The appe llants were\n\nsentenced to death by electrocution for the three murder convictions and received\n\nforty year sentences for each of the other offenses. The jury found the existence\n\nof four aggravating circumstances as to each appellant for each murder conviction:\n\n1) the mu rder wa s espe cially heino us, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture;\n\n2) the appellants co mmitted m ass murd er; 3) the appellan ts had previously been\n\nconvicted of one or more violent felonies; and 4) the murders were committed during\n\nthe perpe tration o f espe cially aggravated kidnapping and especially aggravated\n\nrobbery. T.C.A. § 39-13-20 4(i)(2), (5), (7), and (12). On appeal, the appellants raise\n\nthe following issues concerning alleged errors occurring before trial as well as during\n\nboth p hase s of the trial:\n\n\n\n                                 Appellant Carru thers\n\n       Whether appellant was denied his right to due process by h aving to\n       represe nt himse lf;\n\n       Whe ther ap pellan t was d enied the effe ctive a ssista nce o f coun sel;\n\n       Whether the state should have been required to elect on which\n       indictment it was proceeding;\n\n       Whethe r the grand jury pro ceedings w ere proper;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay and irrelevant\n       evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court should have ordered a competency evaluation\n       of a prosecution witness;\n\n       Whether the co urt erro neou sly adm itted vid eotap e and photo graph ic\n       evidence;\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      Whether appellant was denied his right to be present at sentencing for\n      the especially aggravated kidnapping convictions;\n\n      Whe ther the p rosecu tor enga ged in im proper a rgume nt;\n\n      Whethe r the trial court erred in issuing a gag order;\n\n       Whether the death penalty statute is unconstitutional; and\n\n       Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.\n\n\n\n                                Appellant Mo ntgomery\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in denying appellant’s motion for\n       severance;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence;\n\n       Whe ther the p rosecu tor enga ged in im proper a rgume nt;\n\n       Whe ther prior cons istent state ments were im properly introduce d into\n       evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in admitting photographic evidence;\n\n       Whether the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the victims\n       taken while they were alive;\n\n       Whether the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of alternative\n       perpetrators;\n\n       Whether the trial court improperly admitted opinion testimony;\n\n       Whether the trial court properly instructed the jury;\n\n       Whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdicts;\n\n       Whe ther the death pena lty statu te is un cons titutiona l.\n\n\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the 82 volume record in light of the issues raised by\n\nboth appellants in their separate briefs, and finding no errors requiring reversal of\n\neither the c onviction s or sente nces, w e affirm the judgm ent of the tria l court.\n\n\n\n                                        HISTORY\n\n       In order to put the proce dural h istory o f this case in proper perspective for the\n\nissues raised, we will first outline the events leading up to trial and will then discuss\n\nthe evidence introduced at trial. The appellants were indicted for first degree murder\n\nin March 1994. The Office of the Public Defender was appointed to represent\n\nMontgomery. Carruthers initially retained an attorney, A.C. W harton, who was\n\nsubs eque ntly allowed to withdraw because of a poten tial conflict of inte rest. Nothing\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fin the rec ord su gges ts this conflict was created by the co nduct o f Carruth ers. At a\n\nhearing on April 27, 1994, the trial court mentioned that Carruthers informed the\n\ncourt he wanted some input as to which attorney would be appointed to his case.\n\nIn a sub sequ ent he aring o n Ma y 18, 1 994, C arruth ers ind icated that his family ’s\n\nattempt to retain cou nsel failed. H e aske d the cou rt to appo int cou nsel so he co uld\n\nstart filing mo tions.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers, who eventually represented himself at trial, was appointed a\n\nnumber of attorneys throughout the two years leading up to the trial in this case.\n\nAlthough we go into more detail below, for the sake of reference we will list in order\n\nall the attorneys who were appointed and allowed to withdraw: Larry Nance\n\n(appointed May 1994 - withdrawn December 1994); Craig Morton (appointed August\n\n1994 - withdrawn July 1995 ); Coleman Garrett (appointed December 1994 -\n\nwithdrawn July 1995); W illiam Masse y (appointed J uly 1995 - w ithdrawn Jan uary\n\n1996); Harry Sayle (appo inted J uly 1995 - withdrawn February 1 996). The trial court\n\nalso appoin ted at differe nt times tw o attorne ys, Jam es Turn er and G lenn W right, to\n\nassist in the inve stigation o f the case , but both were subs equen tly allowed to\n\nwithd raw a s well.\n\n\n\n       On May 31, 1 994, after Carru thers informed the court that he had no success\n\nin hiring another lawyer, the trial court appointed Larry N ance. On July 8, 1994, the\n\nstate filed its notice to seek the death penalty against both appellants for each\n\nmurder charge. In a hearing on July 15, 1994, the trial court scheduled a hearing on\n\npretrial motion s for Sep tembe r 30, 199 4, and se t the trial date for February 20, 1995.\n\nCarruthers was present at the hearing and asked the trial court “why this is being\n\ndragged out like this. I asked Mr. N ance if w e can go forward with a motion of\n\ndiscovery and he’s asking for a reset. And I’d like to know why.” Nance informed\n\nthe court that he was going to visit the prosecutor’s office later in the week to review\n\ntheir evidence. The trial court stated:\n\n\n\n       Court: This is a complex case. We have several lawyers who have a\n       lot of work to do on this case and a lot of work to do on other cases that\n       they’re handling --\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      Carruthers: Y eah, Your H onor, but --\n\n      Court: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\n              And we’ve got a trial date now as early as possible. A three-\n      defendant capital murder case requires at least a week, probably two,\n      to try an d so w e can ’t set it this fa ll beca use th is fall is alre ady fu ll.\n              We’ve already go t cases set for trial every week between now\n      and January. And Mr. Stein [counsel for Montgomery] has cases set\n      throughout Janu ary. So the ea rliest po ssible date, th e earlie st pos sible\n      date, that we can try a three-defendant capital murder case is in\n      February. That’s the best we can do.\n              We’ve got a lot of other cases . There are a lo t of othe r peop le\n      sitting back the re waiting for their trials that have been waiting longer\n      than you have.\n              And so given the fact that the trial isn’t until February, we’re\n      setting the next Court date in September for the arguing of motions.\n      Between now and September, your attorney and the attorneys\n      representing your two co-defendants can get with the prosecutors and\n      can obtain their discovery.\n              They’re all excellent attorneys. And they’ll all do that. And once\n      they’ve obtained the discov ery, the y’ll mee t with th eir clien ts and they’ll\n      file appropriate motions, which will be heard on September 30th, which\n      will still be well in advance of the trial date, which will give everyone\n      amp le time to then evaluate the case, after the motions have been\n      heard and ruled on.\n              So given the fact that w e can ’t get a three-defendant capital case\n      that’s still in the arraignment stage to trial any earlier than February,\n      there’s plenty of time for your attorneys to meet with the prosecutors,\n      get the discovery, meet with the clients, file motions, argue motions.\n              Just because he hadn’t done it yeste rday, b ecau se yo u wan t him\n      to have it done yesterday, doesn’t mean that he’s not working on your\n      case diligen tly and prope rly. He’ll h ave e veryth ing do ne we ll in\n      advance of the next Court date.\n              And so, you know, he may not do it the very moment you want\n      it done, b ut you’re going to have to work with him on that because\n      there’s ample time for him to get it done.\n\n      Carruthers: I talked to him over forty-five days ago [approximately the\n      time Nance was appointed] and asked him to talk to the medical\n      examiner abou t getting the tim e of de ath an d auto psy. H e had n’t did\n      that yet.\n\n      Court: Well, that’s fine.\n\n      Carruthers: And that’s forty-five days.\n\n      Court: T hat’s fine. S tep out.\n\n\n      The record reflects that Nance filed numerous pretrial motions, including\n\nreques ts for discovery, investigative services and a menta l exam ination. On August\n\n12, 1994 , Craig Morto n was appo inted a s co-c ouns el for Carruthers. The rec ord\n\nreflects that Mo rton started filing a litany of m otions after his appointment. These\n\nincluded motions in limine to exclude certain evidence, e.g., letters Carruthers\n\nmailed to Jim my M aze, a motio n for ind ividua l voir dire, motions for various\n\ndiscovery reques ts, a motion for impeachment evidence, a motion for competency\n\nevaluation of prosecution witnesses, motion for another mental evaluation of\n\n                                              5\n\fCarruthers, motions to dismiss the indictments, motion to suppress statement of co-\n\ndefendant Jonathan M ontgom ery, motions for s everance , a motion for exp ert\n\nservices , and a no tice of an a libi defense .\n\n\n\n       In a hearing on September 30, 1994, the trial court continued the motion\n\nhearing date u ntil Nove mbe r 18, 19 94. Th e cou rt stated that it wo uld consider any\n\nmotion filed by either appellant to apply to both, if applicable. The trial judge also\n\nmentioned that he had re ceived “an abu ndanc e of corre spond ence” fro m both\n\nappellan ts expressing c oncern about the pretrial performance of counsel. The court\n\nallowed coun sel to make statements on the record in response to these letters.\n\nInitially, Nance stated that the defense had almost obtained complete discovery from\n\nthe state. He further stated that he could not say ho w ma ny of the 1 00 state\n\nwitnesses (which included everyone remotely related to this case including all of the\n\npolice officers and state employees) he had interviewed, but that he had alr eady\n\nissued subpoenas for about eight of those witnesses. Nance indicated that he had\n\nmet with Ca rruthers tw o sepa rate occa sions for a n exten ded pe riod of time to\n\ndiscuss his case. He had also met Carruthers’ family to discuss matters. Nance\n\nadmitted there was quite a bit more work yet to be done, such as obtaining the\n\nservices of an investigator, an d stated that he h ad spent ap proximately 2 5 hours\n\nwork ing on the case up to that time, including discussions with co-counsel about\n\ndefense strategy. Nance also informed the court that there was “some enm ity that’s\n\ndeveloped betwe en he a nd I,” but that counsel had hoped it could be worked out.\n\n\n\n       The court also allowed Ca rruthers to tell his side of the story . Carruthers\n\ndisputed counsel’s recollection of the visits and informed the court that he had filed\n\na complaint with the Board of Professional Responsibility against Nance. He also\n\nstated that counsel ha s shown no “eagern ess” in this case a nd that he did n ot “fear”\n\ncounse l.   Carruth ers’ ma in com plaint see med to be a lack of face-to-fa ce\n\ncommunications. The court acknowledged the appellants’ concerns given what they\n\nfaced, but told them tha t many as pects of the attorne y-client relationship did not\n\ninvolve personal contact. The court stated that the representation up to that point\n\nas he saw it was well w ithin the proper standards: the appropriate motions had been\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\ffiled, discovery had been sought, and conferences had been held. The fact that the\n\nappe llants m ay no t like the ir attorney s, accord ing to the tria l court, had no bearing\n\non counsel’s performance.\n\n\n\n       On October 21, 1994, the trial court authorized payment for investigative\n\nservices (Arthur R. Anderson) for Carruthers. Morton informed the court, howev er,\n\nthat the investigator tried to talk to Carruthers on two sep arate occa sions at the ja il\n\nbut was told Carruthers refused to see him. Also at the hearing on the 21st, the\n\nprosecutor informed the court that he had provided all the disc overy he had at that\n\npoint; he wa s still waiting o n a ballistic report. In addition, the court authorized\n\ncomp etency evaluations for each appellant. In a hearing before the trial court on\n\nNovember 18, 1994, Morton requested permission to hire a new investigator\n\nbecause he felt the one they had, Arthur Anderson, was not taking an aggressive\n\nenough role in the matter. The court continued the hearing date on pretrial motions\n\nuntil December 16, 1994.         Morton informed the court in another hearing on\n\nNovember 23, 1994, that they had secured the services of Premier Investigations.\n\n\n\n       Throughout Nance and Morton’s representation, Carruthers filed various pro\n\nse motions on his own be half. Along with a m otion fo r subs titution o f coun sel,\n\nCarruthers filed motions similar to those filed by counsel, as well as those filed by\n\nhis co-defendant, James Montgomery. In fact, many of these pro se filings are\n\nidentical to those filed by Montgomery pro se. On Decem ber 9, 1994, Larry Nance\n\nwas allowed to withdraw as counsel. The record does not contain a copy of the\n\nmotion or transcript of a hear ing, if there w as one . Colem an Ga rrett was appointed\n\nas co-counsel that same day.          Thereafter, counsel continued to file motions,\n\nincluding motions to continue the trial date . Carruthers also continued filing pro se\n\npleadings.    Similarly, Morton filed several motions prepared by Carruthers,\n\nappa rently at Carruthers’ insistence. On December 16, 1994, the court heard most\n\nof the motions filed by counsel, and continued hearing on those involving an\n\nevidentiary hearing until Janu ary 30, 1 995.       It should be noted that since the\n\nbeginning of this ca se, M ontgo mery also vo iced n ume rous c omp laints a bout h is\n\ncoun sel.    In fact, counsel was allowed to withdraw from M ontgo mery ’s\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\frepresentation as well. There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest that\n\nMon tgom ery’s c ondu ct was as eg regiou s as C arruth ers’.\n\n\n\n      Garrett and Morton appeared at the motion hearing on January 30, 1995, and\n\npresented argument on over seventeen motions, including joining the motions filed\n\nby the code fendan t. These motions addressed suppression and discovery issues,\n\nre-evaluation of Carruthers, co mpeten cy of state witnes ses, severan ce, expert\n\nservices, and courtroom security. Also at the hearing, the trial court continued the\n\ntrial date until September 5, 1995.\n\n\n\n      On May 1, 19 95, Garrett and Morton inform ed the court they had been having\n\ndifficulty finding a willing investigator because of the nature of the case and the pay\n\n(the court ad opted a paym ent scheme whereby th e inve stigato r wou ld be p aid\n\n$1,000 and must file an accounting of services and the court would then decide later\n\nif additional funding was appropriate; the court set the hourly rate the same as for\n\nthe attorney s, but app arently the investiga tors wer e dem anding more). G arrett\n\nsecured an investigator to appear at the hearing, but when the court announced the\n\namount of compensation granted for her services, she informed counsel she was\n\nunab le to take the case. The court decided that since coun sel wa s hav ing trou ble\n\nfinding an investigator, the c ourt would appoint a third attorney (James Turner) , to\n\nbe paid at the sam e rate as cou nsel, to serve as appellant’s investiga tor. Carruthers\n\nobjected to this alternative, stating that attorneys cannot obtain the same information\n\nas a certified investigator. The court stated that Carru thers’ o bjectio n was not we ll\n\nfounded. Coun sel also a ddress ed sev eral pretrial m otions, inclu ding a m otion to\n\ndismiss indictments (Alfredo Shaw testified before the grand ju ry, but the s tate\n\ninformed the court that it was not going to use Alfredo Shaw’s statements at trial\n\nbecause the state had since considered him to be unreliable), a motion to sever, and\n\na motio n for ex pert se rvices to ana lyze an audio tape o f Nake ita Mo ntgom ery’s\n\nstatem ent.\n\n\n\n      On May 5, 19 95, Attorney James Turner appeared before the court and\n\nstated, due to the number of witnesses Carruthers named and the amoun t of work\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\finvolved in the ca se, he did no t believ e, as a solo p ractition er, that h e cou ld\n\neffectiv ely perfor m inv estiga tion to a ssist co unse l. The c ourt sta ted tha t it would\n\ncontinue to locate an attorney/investigator. Attorney Glenn Wright was subsequently\n\nappointed to ass ist Mo rton an d Ga rrett in investigating the case. On June 2, 1995,\n\nGarrett argue d the a ppella nt’s m otion to dism iss indic tmen ts due to Sha w’s alle gedly\n\nfalse testimony before the grand jury.\n\n\n\n       Morton and Garrett eventually filed a motion to withdraw. The record re flects\n\nthat Carruthers also filed a motion for substitution of counsel. The trial court granted\n\nboth requests and in a hearing on July 27, 1995, the court appointed William Massey\n\nand Harry Sayle to represent Carruthers. During this hearing, the trial judge made\n\nthe following comments:\n\n\n\n               All right. I understand that these three defendants are on trial for\n       their lives and that these are the most serious of charges and that they\n       are all concerned that they are we ll repres ented and p roper ly\n       represented, and it’s every one’s desire to see to it that th ey are well\n       represented and p roper ly represented . And toward that end, efforts are\n       being made that they are represented by attorneys that have enough\n       experience to handle this type of case and by attorneys that can\n       establish a rapport with their clients that would allow them to represent\n       their clie nts as well.\n               We have gone through several attorneys n ow in an effort to\n       accommodate the defendants’ requests in that regard; but at some\n       point -- and in m y opinion , each of the attorneys and each of the\n       investigators that has represented these defendants that has been\n       relieved have been eminently qualified to do the jo b, but I have allowed\n       them to be relieved for one rea son or ano ther.\n               I want the record to be perfectly clear at this point because of\n       some suggestions that have already been raised by some of the\n       correspondence that I have received from M r. Carruth ers; and all of it,\n       by the way, will be made a part of the record. But Mr. Carruthers has\n       suggested, in his correspondence, that some of the previous attorneys\n       have been relieved because they weren’t capable or competent to do\n       the job. And this is, in my opinion, at least -- my humble opinion as the\n       judge in this ca se -- ab solutely and totally an inacc urate sta temen t.\n       The attorne ys tha t have been relieve d thus far hav e bee n fully ca pable\n       and fully competen t and had be en doing an outstanding job ; but for a\n       variety of reasons, I’ve allowed them to withdraw from the case.\n               Obv iously Mr. Carruthers can say anything he wants. It’s a free\n       country. He can write letters to the Commercial Appeal or the\n       President of the United States and say whatever it is he wants to say.\n       But the point is that I want the record to reflect, each step of the way,\n       so that if he is conv icted, a nd if so if he raises these sorts of questions\n       three years or five years or ten years down the road, the record is\n       perfec tly clear that these attorneys were not relieved because they\n       were not doing an ade quate job. They were not relieved because Mr.\n       Carruthers was not well represented and left in an untenable position\n       because he ha d ineffe ctive a ssista nce o f coun sel pre trial. Tha t is\n       absolutely not the case in my opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f        Mr. Carruthers has raised, through his correspondence, and\nappa rently through direct communication with his previous attorneys,\ncertain matters that are pretty outrageous suggestions; but because of\nthe nature of the matters that he’s raised, the attorneys that\nrepresented him previously felt that an irreparable breach had occurred\nbetween their ability -- between Mr. Carruthe rs and them selves --\neffecting their ability to continue to represent them. And at some point\n-- and that could well have been the point, but it wasn’t. But at some\npoint these ma tters that are raised by the defendants cannot continue\nto be used to get new counsel because it gets to be a point where\nthey’re -- it’s already well beyond the point, but, obviously, at some\npoint, gets to the point where they’re manipulating the system and\ngetting what they want -- Mr. Carruthers, sit still, plea se, or y ou ca n sit\nback there. -- gets to the point where they’re manipulating the system\nand getting trial dates and representation that they want and are calling\nthe shots. That’s another matter that’s bee n raised by M r. Carruthers\nin some of his correspondence; that he w ants his a ttorneys to know that\nhe’s the man c alling the sh ots in this ca se, and he’s the m an to look to.\n        Well, of course , again, it’s a fre e coun try, and he can say\nwhatever he wants, and he can think whatever he wants; but as far as\nI’m concerned -- and this applies to all three defendants and any\ndefend ants that come through this court that are represented by\ncounsel -- and this gets back to what Mr. McLin alluded to earlier -- the\nattorneys are calling the shots in this case. They are trying the case\nexcept for certain areas where the defendant has the exclusive and\nfinal say, such as whether he wants to testify or not and that sort of\nthing. The attorney s are in here representing these clients and will do\nso to the best of their ability. They are the ones who have been to law\nscho ol. They are the ones that have been through trial many times\nbefore, and they’re the o nes that are he re for a reason, and that reason\nis to represent these individuals. And, so, you know, if there’s a conflict\nbetween the attorney and client with regard to how to proceed in the\ncase, you all resolve it as be st you ca n, but ultim ately th e attorn ey is\ntrying the case. And, yo u know , we don ’t pull peop le off the sidew alk\nto try these cases; and th e reas on we don’t is because of certain things\nthat they need to learn and certain experiences they need to have\nprofes siona lly before they’re prepared to try these ca ses. So they ’re\nhere for th at reaso n and fo r that purp ose. . . .\n...\n        So that gets me to the reason for our being here. Because of the\nmatters raised by Mr. Carruthers, I have granted th e requ est of h is\nprevious two attorneys and investigato r reluctantly because, in my\nopinion, they were doing an outstanding job of representing Mr.\nCarruthers and his interests.\n        Mr. Carruthers, if you want to laugh through this proceeding,\nthen, again, I’m going to allow y ou to s it back in the ba ck. If you can sit\nhere and listen to what goes on and communicate with your new\nattorney, that’s fine. You have every right to do that. But if you\ncontinue tossin g you r pen in the air and laughing every fifteen seconds,\nthen it’s fine if you sit back in the back, and your attorney can\ncomm unicate with you back there. So it’s up to y ou. I m ean it d oesn ’t\nmake any difference to me. We can have this hearing with you, or we\ncan have it w ithout you . And it’s com pletely your decision, but if you\ncontinue to act in that wa y, I don’t plan to condu ct this busin ess with\nyou back there laughing and that sort of thing. You can put your hand\ndown, and you can talk to your attorney, and he can address me if he\nthinks it’s appropriate . If he thin ks it’s ina pprop riate, the n he d oesn ’t\nhave to, and you’ll have an opp ortunity to address him and talk to your\nattorney in just a minute -- as soon as I’m through making these\nstatements for the record.\n        And, so, again, if -- you know, if you contin ue with this, an d this\nis going to be true for every hearing that we have -- pretrial and during\nthe trial itself -- if you all wa nt to -- if you want to act that way -- if you\nwant to make faces, toss pen s in the air, waive your h and, la ugh, th at’s\n\n                                      10\n\f      fine. You can sit back there and do that, and that’s fine. If you wa nt to\n      sit and listen intently because this is a serious matter to everybody\n      concerned, that’s fin e. It’s your choice. It doesn’t make any difference\n      to me. B ut you mak e the d ecisio n, and I’ll -- and if you persist in acting\n      this way, you can sit back there, and your attorney can convey to you\n      wha t’s going on in court. If you want to sit and act responsibly out here,\n      you can do so, and you can participate in the trial. Now, whe re were\n      we?\n             Because of the most recent rash of allegations raised by Mr.\n      Carruthers in his many letters that he’s sent me -- I assume he’s sent\n      copies of the letters to his counsel and to others; but I’ve certainly got\n      them, and they will be made a part of the record. And because of the\n      types of things he alleged in those letters a nd the positio n that it p ut his\n      previous attorneys in, and their very, very strong feelings about not\n      continuing to represent Mr. Carruthers under those c ircums tances , I\n      have reluctantly agreed to let them withdraw.\n      ...\n             And as I have sta ted, I’m run ning ou t of patienc e with reg ard to\n      these different issues -- and I use that word advisedly -- being raised by\n      the clients w ith rega rd to an y obje ctions they h ave w ith rega rd to the ir\n      attorneys. And as far as I’m concerned, there are the attorneys\n      [Massey and Sayle] that will represent these men at trial. It’s going to\n      have to be one gigantic co nflict -- one gigantic and real proven,\n      demo nstrated conflict before any of these men will be relieved from\n      representation in this case. There will be no more perceived conflicts,\n      no more unfou nded , wild alle gations raised through correspondence,\n      no more dissatisfaction with how my attorney is handling my case for\n      anybody to be relieved in this case.\n             These are the attorneys, gentlemen. You either work with them\n      or don’t. It’s up to you. Bu t they’re the men th at are going to be\n      represe nting you at trial. . . . [empha sis adde d].\n\n\n      The court also , consiste nt with prior practice in this case, authorized an initial\n\n$1,000 for investigative services and conditioned any further compensation on an\n\nitemized showing of necessity by the investigator. Massey stated he preferred to\n\nuse his own investigator rather than a third attorney; the investigator was Arthur\n\nAnderson, the same investigator originally hired b y counsel in this ca se. Thereafter,\n\nfor some reason, the trial court entered two orders to that affect. An order filed\n\nAugust 11, 1995, allowed Morton and G arrett to withdraw and appointed Attorneys\n\nWilliam Massey and Harry Sayle; an order filed on September 29, 1995, permitted\n\ncounsel and Glenn Wright to withdraw.\n\n\n\n      On August 11, August 31, and September 27, 1995, the trial court authorized\n\nadditional compensation for investigative services. In a hearing on August 11, 1995,\n\ndue to his rec ent ap pointm ent, M asse y requ ested and w as gra nted a trial\n\ncontinuance until Ja nuary 8, 199 6.       Ma ssey inform ed the court th at there still\n\nremained som e disco very to be ha d in the case and that his investigator had been\n\nworking diligently on the matter.\n\n                                            11\n\f       Like previo us co unse l, Massey and Sayle filed numerous pretrial motions on\n\nbeha lf of the app ellant. In a hearing on November 17, 1995, Massey informed the\n\ncourt that he had filed all the necessary and appropriate pretrial motions. On\n\nDecember 19, 1995, Massey filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Cou nsel’s\n\nmotion expla ined th at “his re lations hip with [Carruthers] has deteriorated to such a\n\nserious degree that he can not provide effective assistance as required by state and\n\nfederal law. . . C ouns el’s professional judgment cannot be exercised solely for the\n\nbene fit of Defendant, as counsel fears fo r his safety and those around him. As such,\n\ndefendant cannot have effective communication with counsel to discuss the case\n\nand counsel cannot discuss strategy and legal options with Defendant.” Attached\n\nto this nine page motion are seve ral letters Ca rruthers m ailed to co unsel in late\n\nNovember and early December 1995. In these letters, Carru thers accused counsel\n\nof lying, threa tened c ounse l, and can didly exp ressed his overa ll dissatisfactio n with\n\nthe way counsel handled his case. Excerpts from these letters are quoted below:\n\n\n\n       [Letter dated November 22, 1995] You have violate[d] the code of\n       ethics by lying to me and my co-defendant James Montgomery that the\n       prosecutor Jerry Harris had a plea barg ain of 25 y ears.

I will will [sic] and report you to the board\n       of professional responsibility ethic misconduct [sic]. I want your\n       dishonesty, fraud and deceit to be exposed and acknowledged.

I’m asking you as nice as I can\n       to stay away from me.

You save the best for last. P.S. This is your last one!\n        [emphasis added]\n\n       [Letter dated December 5, 1995] You have violated several ethic codes\n       with your style and tactics.

You need to get your sorry but\n       [sic] over here to this jail house and tell me what kind of strategy you\n       have fo r trial Mr. Slick T alker;\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       [Letter dated December 6, 1995] I want to see you in [sic] your\n       investigator over at the jail as soon as you receiv e this letter w ith a full\n       report and transcribe interviews from witnesses.

Everyday until my trial date you\n       need to send somebody over here to keep me informed of your\n       progress.\n\n       [Letter dated December 7, 1995] You are one white boy i don’t even\n       worry about.

I’m telling you now there will be no\n       turning back the hands of time. You have violated my rights to equal\n       protection, and there will be no COMPROMISING! I don’t know if you\n       are on that COCAINE again but don’t let the d rug alter yo u [sic] ability\n       to see the truth and no [sic] the truth. I will not excep t [sic] anything\n       other than the truth. I realize you boys went to school to be\n       profess ional liars, bu t I’m not ha ving it.\n\n\nAlso attached to the m otion is a statem ent from M assey’s sec retary describing\n\nCarru thers’s abusive and threatening tone during her telephone conve rsations w ith\n\nhim:\n\n\n\n       I received a collect call from Tony Carruthers . . . on December 13,\n       1995. . . . It was then he started screaming and cursing, most of which\n       I couldn’t u ndersta nd. One p art I did understand and remember was\n       that if he go t close enou gh to B ill [Mas sey] h e was going to whip his\n       white ass. He repeated this several times. The way he was screaming\n       and yelling rea lly scar ed m e. I belie ve he was v ery se rious in his\n       threats. I told him that I wa sn’t go ing to list en to h is threa ts and he sa id\n       “F--k you, too, you whore,” at least twice before I started to hang up.\n       [emphasis added]\n\n\n       On December 19, 1995, the trial court held a hearing on pretrial motions,\n\nincluding counsel’s motion to withdraw. Before counsel presented arguments, the\n\njudge made the following statements for the record:\n\n\n\n               A couple of statements I need to m ake for the reco rd before we\n       begin the hearings that were scheduled today, the cases, in fact, set for\n       trial on the 8th of January.\n               My first statement is that all statements that these defendants\n       need to mak e to this Co urt can and will be m ade th rough their\n       attorneys. They are represented by very experienced, highly effective,\n       excellent trial attorneys and anything they need to say, w ith regard to\n       their trial, will be addressed to me throug h their a ttorney s. And if there\n       are any disruptions or problems -- disruptions caused by the\n       defend ants in the process of these hearings, then they will be removed\n       to the room behind this do or, and we’ll co ntinue with the hearin gs in\n       their absence.\n               Secondly, the letters that I have received from Mr. Mon tgomery\n       and Mr. Carruthers over the past several months I have diligen tly tried\n\n                                              13\n\f     to main tain. I’ve hand ed the m all o ver to the clerk’s office. They’ve\n     filed them all in one of th e clerk’s files. W e have dozens if not hundreds\n     of letters from these two defendants over the past several months. I’ve\n     opened each one. I’ve read each one. I’ve tried to give copies to\n     defense counsel. If I’ve not done that I’ve certainly made them\n     availa ble by putting them in the jacke ts. There ’s been n o secre t as to\n     the content of any of the letters.\n             About a week ago I received a letter from one of the defendants,\n     Mr. Carruthers, in which he told me that he was going to send me an\n     envelope full of roaches from the jail. I gues s to -- I guess to suggest\n     that there is a roach p roblem in the S helby Cou nty Jail or whatev er.\n     But my job description does not include opening letters of that sort. So,\n     for the record I will no longer open any letters from either of these\n     defendants. They have from that day and will continue to be put\n     imm ediate ly in the trash. If they have anything to say, they can, again,\n     address me through their attorneys. They’re represented by excellent\n     coun sel, and they can se nd lette rs to the ir attorneys, and their attorneys\n     can then address me on anything that relates to this case.\n\n\n     The court the n heard statem ents from Mass ey con cerning his motio n to\n\nwithdraw.\n\n            I would ju st say I don’t n eed to, I don’t guess, repeat word for\n     word what’s in [m y motion ]. I would just say that in 15 years of\n     practicing law, I have never ever made a motion of this nature. I have\n     never -- I’ve neve r found it difficu lt to advoc ate on b ehalf of a c ase. I\n     wou ldn’t find it difficult to advocate on behalf of this cas e. I do a t this\n     point, however, find it very difficult to advocate on behalf of Mr.\n     Carruthers. And that is simply because he’s made it that way.\n            If I were receiving letters that merely stated I was incompetent\n     and that I wasn’t handling his case right, and those type letters -- we all\n     get those time to time -- I don’t mind those. Those don’t bother me.\n            When I have letters that come to me that are threatening, when\n     I have telephone calls that come to my office that are threatening the\n     safety of me and my staff and those around me, I have real problems\n     with that.\n            It’s gotten so bad, Your Honor, that my secretary is having\n     nightmares. The la st call M r. Carru thers m ade is Exhib it E to this\n     verified motion . She called me in absolute tears crying uncontrollably,\n     hyste rically crying over his antics. That’s the same way he’s been\n     doing m e. I just have n’t broken down and star ted crying about it.\n            But I do have very, very strong, such strong personal\n     reservations as I have never experienced before as an advocate. Your\n     Honor, in adv ocatin g cas es, pa rticularly capital cases, I find the first\n     thing I have to do to be persuasive is to believe. I have to believe and\n     I have to feel. Because if I don’t believe and I don’t feel and I’m not\n     sincere, I cannot impart that to a jury. They see my insincerity. They\n     just see words, a parrot-like proficiency as opposed to feeling. They\n     don’t act on that. They shut that out. That’s been my experience. And\n     I don’t believe that that feeling, I know that I can’t advocate. I’ve lost\n     my will to advocate on this case. I don’t have any doubt about that at\n     this point. I don’t have any doubt. I’ll tell you as an officer of this c ourt.\n     I don’t have any doubt that would be a major problem.\n            And despite Mr. Carruthers threats and antics, I care for the\n     integrity of the system. I care that his rights are protected even when\n     he tries to destroy them himself and impair them. And I don’t know\n     what the Cou rt’s answ er is. I know that the Court is in a ve ry difficu lt\n     position here.\n            Obviously, it’s very clear what the ploy is. It’s very clear that\n     we’re never g oing to ge t to trial like this. And if we do , then th ere’s\n     going to be a record made for ineffective assistance of counsel. And\n     they believe, Mr. Carruthers believes, that doing all of thes e thing s is\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      going to make him a record, as opposed to doing things from a legal\n      standpoint in the courtroom.\n\n\nThe trial judge responded:\n\n\n             In my opinion, to try to make the record reflect as clearly and\n      accu rately as possible the fact that the system is doing everything it can\n      to mak e sure that M r. Carru thers is prope rly and thorou ghly\n      represented in this case.\n             And Mr. Carruthers may step out to the back. He just was\n      pointing to Mr. M assey w ith some sort of threatening gesture. And h e’s\n      going to sit in the back for the rem ainde r of this hearing. Put him in the\n      back room and keep him back there. Lock the door. Mr. Montgomery,\n      you will join him in a minute if you choose to conduct yourself in that\n      man ner as well.\n             The system has done all it can, in my opinion, to ma ke sure that\n      Mr. Toney [sic] Ca rruthers is well represented. And I’ve tried to be as\n      patient as I can be in listening to the concerns of defense counsel and\n      investigators in ma king sure that no conflict existed in the\n      representation of either of these men.\n             The specific reasons, the narrow specific reasons for the excusal\n      of the previous a ttorneys and inv estigators differ a little bit from those\n      comp laints that Mr. Mas sey has raise d today. And so when Mr.\n      Massey says “That just because I’m the 4th or 5th attorney in line\n      does n’t mea n that I n ow ha ve to b e stuc k, in effe ct, in rep resen ting him\n      just because others have been relieved and the Court is anxious to get\n      the case tried. My complaints are as valid as theirs were. And if they\n      were relieved, then I should be relieved as we ll.” And I understand that\n      position. But first of all I’ll respond to that by s aying the ir comp laints\n      were a little bit different, and I’m not going to go through them on the\n      record now. The record is clear in tho se inst ance s. One enve lope is\n      sealed with several letters that will reveal what those complaints w ere\n      and the complaints from attorneys prior to th at we re a little bit different\n      in nature. Not to minimize the seriousness of Mr. Massey’s complaints,\n      but those complaints were a little bit different. And so it’s not that he\n      just happens to be the 5th atto rney in line, an d he’s the on e that is\n      going to quote, get stuck, representing Mr. C arruth ers.                   Th eir\n      comp laints were a little bit different. And factually there are some\n      distinctions that can be drawn between the complaints that they had\n      and the complaints that you’ve voiced.\n\n      Mr. Massey : Your Hon or, is the Court finding tha t my com plaints are\n      of a less serious nature than those previously made?\n\n      The Court: Yes. Yes, I am.\n\n      Mr. Massey: The threats of physical bodily harm?\n\n      The Court: Yes, I am. And I’m not minimizing those threats. And I\n      understand that the threats that yo ur secretary rec eived affected h er,\n      and I don’t dou bt that at all. But I do find that they a re different --\n\n      Mr. Massey: Threats I received.\n\n      The Court: And that yo u’ve received , certainly. But I think they are\n      different and less serious in nature and not such as would prevent you\n      from going forward in this case. [emphasis added]\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fThe trial judge stated that he was “much less rece ptive to the se sorts o f argum ents\n\nthan [he] was a year ago when the first set of attorneys came in wanting to be\n\nrelieved.” He also stated that Carruthers never requested to proceed pro se, and\n\nthat he was “not going to force a ma n to go pro se in a cap ital case if he do esn’t\n\nwant.” The trial court denied Massey ’s motion to withd raw. The trial court, ho wever,\n\ndid authorize additional funds for investigation and mitigation.\n\n\n\n       In another hearing on Janua ry 2, 1996, Massey again requested permission\n\nto withdraw. Massey informed the court that he had continued to receive threatening\n\nletters at his home and was co ncerne d for his da ughter’s s afety because Carruthers\n\nreferred to the car she drove. Mas sey stated tha t he cared m ore about C arruthers\n\nreceiving a fair trial than Carruthers himself did, but that due to the actions of\n\nCarruthers Massey did not believe he could responsibly represent him. He told the\n\ncourt, quite c learly, “I d on’t want to repres ent this man . I can’t re prese nt him . I won’t\n\nrepresent him .”\n\n\n\n       During this hearing, the prosecution, for the first time, voiced its position on the\n\nmatter. The prosecutor recounted the procedural history of the case, that several\n\nextrem ely competent and professional attorneys were forced off the case by\n\nCarruthers, and stated:\n\n\n\n       And if a defendant, Your honor, can threaten the system, if he can\n       manip ulate the system by threats, by letters, I’m not sure if that’s what\n       the makers of the constitution meant when they sat in Philadelphia and\n       they said, look, let’s let every defendant have a fair trial. Le t’s let him\n       have a lawyer. Let’s let a jury be over here. Let’s let him have a judge;\n       that’s fair. Let’s let no m an be accu sed o f a crim e, will not go to trial,\n       unless he receives a fair trial. Let no man be c onvicted -- but the\n       framers of the constitution, Your Honor, had not met Tony Carruthers.\n\n\nThe prosec utor und erstood Mass ey’s pred icame nt, but told the co urt it sim ply could\n\nnot allow Carruthers to continue the trial of the case any longer. The court, again,\n\ndenied Massey’s request. The court’s main concern, apparently, was that it could\n\nnot just keep granting these requests to withdraw; there had to be an end to it. The\n\ncourt noted, tho ugh, tha t everything that had taken place during the course of the\n\nproceedings had be en reco rded so the app ellate courts “can un derstand w hy we’re\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fin this dilemm a that we ’re in today . So that they ca n understan d why M r. Carruthers\n\nwou ld be representing himse lf . . . so that they can have the full understanding.” At\n\none point during the hearing, Carruthers stated to the court that he did not w ant\n\nMassey representing him because Massey was on co caine. The rec ord also reflec ts\n\nthat during the hea ring Car ruthers w as glaring at Mas sey an d gritting his ja w.\n\n\n\n       Although the trial c ourt pr eviou sly me ntione d that it w as no t going to force\n\nCarruthers to repre sent h imse lf in this ca pital trial, after furthe r though t the court,\n\nciting federa l case la w, stat ed tha t Carru thers h ad tw o optio ns rem aining, either\n\nproceed with Massey and Sayle or proceed pro se. The record clearly reflects that\n\neveryone involved in this case , with the a pparen t exceptio n of Carr uthers, w as\n\nparticu larly frustrated w ith the turn of events. The court, for the record again, stated\n\nthat in its opin ion all o f the atto rneys appo inted in this case were excellent trial\n\nlawyers and had fully performed their duties, including filing all relevant motions and\n\nthoroughly pursuing the investigation.\n\n\n\n       Thereafter, Massey sought a T.R .A.P. 10 extrao rdinary appea l to this Cou rt.\n\nIn an order dated January 8, 1996, this Court re counte d som e of the sta temen ts\n\nfrom the letters written by Carruthers, including a description of the car driven by\n\nMassey’s daughter, a n alleg ation th at Ca rruthe rs’ friend s cou ld disco ver de tails\n\nabout Mass ey like the c olor of his too thbrush in his hom e, and a statement to the\n\ntrial judge accusing Massey of using cocaine.            After noting that several other\n\nattorneys were allowed to withdraw in this case, the Court stated:\n\n\n\n              This Court is of the opinion that the attorney-client relationship,\n       which may have previously existed, has deteriorated until such a\n       relation ship does not exist between Carruthers and Mr. Massey. Also,\n       the circumstances of this case m ake it imp ossible fo r Mr. Ma ssey to\n       ethica lly represent Mr. Carruthers. Carruthers has proclaimed that he\n       will do bodily harm to Massey. He has in essence and in fact\n       threatened Massey with death. Carruthers, who has a history of violent\n       condu ct, is apparently a member of a gang. All of his correspondence\n       to Massey carries a drawing of a lidless eye that watches from the top\n       of a pyramid. M oreover, Massey’s family is filled with fear and an xiety\n       due to the threats made to Massey; and Massey’s secretary, who has\n       had dealings with C arruthers by telep hone, likewise has fear and\n       anxiety based upon her conversations with Ca rruthers a nd the thr eats\n       made against Massey. Given these circumstances, Mr. Massey had no\n       alternative but to seek permission to withdraw as counsel. He is\n       supported in this endeavor by the Disciplinary Counsel for the\n\n                                             17\n\f       Tennessee Supreme Court Office, which advised Massey that he was\n       ethica lly required to withdraw as counsel, and, if the motion was\n       denied, he was required to seek relief in the appellate courts.\n       ...\n               Given these facts and circumstances as well as the relevant\n       provisions of the Code of Professional Conduct, which governs the\n       conduct of lawyers in the State of Tennessee, Mr. Massey was entitled\n       to be relieved as c ounsel of reco rd for Mr. Carruthers. If there ever was\n       an amic able a ttorney -client re lations hip, it was erad icated by M r.\n       Carruthers’s conduct in writing the letters aforementioned and\n       threatening to do bodily harm to Mr. Massey the first time he saw him.\n       Today, Mr. Massey and Mr. Carruthers are at odds and their\n       differences are irreconcilable.           Furthermore, Mr. Massey, who\n       emp hatica lly denied any m iscondu ct or add iction to dru gs, mu st attempt\n       to protec t his fam ily, secr etary, a nd him self from physical harm as well\n       as protect himself from further disciplinary complaints.\n\n\n       This Court granted Massey’s request and allowed him to withdraw.\n\nInterestingly, in a hearing on January 8, 1996, the trial court allowe d coun sel to\n\nwithdraw, but this was appa rently before the jud ge rec eived a cop y of this Cour t’s\n\norder. That day, Massey had filed a supplement to his motion to withdraw, and\n\nattach ed se ven m ore lette rs Ca rruthe rs ma iled to c ouns el’s ho me a nd bu sines s in\n\nlate December 1995. These letters were also attached to the application Massey\n\nfiled in this Court. Although Carruthers was aware of the motion to withdraw filed by\n\nMassey, he persisted in sending even more letters to counsel which only added\n\nammunition to counsel’s cau se. In these letters, Ca rruthers again, in an accusatory\n\nand threatening tone, expressed his dissatisfaction with Massey’s representation:\n\n\n\n       [Letter dated December 19, 1995] Hey M r.

Like I to ld you, let your\n      conscience be your guide.\n\n      [Letter to trial judge dated December 27, 1995] I have once, twice, and\n      even three times wrote you and made you aware that my attorney of\n      the record William D. Massey is ineffe ctive in h is assis tance of cou nsel.\n      We have disag reed on m ore than one occasion ab out which rights of\n      mine where [sic] being violated. He Mr. William D. Massey has refused\n      to prope rly investigate my case. He refuse to file prosecutorial\n      misconduct charges against the Asst. Attorney General Jerry Harris.\n      He also is addicted to cocaine a [sic] illegal controlled substance which\n      affects his ability to practice law. This is a disgrace to the judicial\n      system.\n\n\nThe record also reflects that Carruthers filed a disciplinary complaint against Massey\n\nwith the Board of Professional Responsibility.\n\n\n\n       Just before the start of jury selection, the trial court, again citing federal\n\nopinions, ruled that Carruthers had forfeited his right to counsel by his egregious\n\nconduct and compelled him to proceed pro se. The trial court, however, appointed\n\nMassey and Sayle to serve as “elbow counsel.”               Despite Massey’s continued\n\nposition that the attorne y-clien t relation ship had com pletely deteriorated, C arruthers\n\ninformed the court that he tried to reconcile with Massey the weekend before the\n\nstart of trial. When the judge made his ruling, Carruthers expressed his concerns\n\nto the court about proceeding pro se; he informed the judge, in essence, that he had\n\nno idea what to do. The judge stated:\n\n\n\n              Well, those are the pe rils in going forward pro se. And in my\n       judgm ent, Mr. Carruthers, as I’ve said on seve ral occ asion s, and I don’t\n       intend to g et back in to a lengthy hearing on this issue at this time, but\n       we’ve had two or three hearings already on this.\n              In my judgment, and I understand you’re stating now that you\n       don’t feel capable of g oing forward and representing yourself. But you\n       need to und erstan d that in my judgment you have created this problem\n       for yourse lf. You are the autho r of your ow n predica ment b y, in my\n       opinion, sabotaging the representation of you by four previous\n       attorneys. These are now your fifth and sixth attorneys. In my\n       judgm ent, because of actions that you’ve taken over the past 18\n       months, because of ac tions th at you ’ve tak en, yo u are n ow in th is\n       situation.\n              And so it ma y well b e difficu lt for you to go fo rward in\n       representing yourse lf, but this is the situation that you’ve created and\n       you’re going to hav e to do the be st you can, b ecau se the re is virtually\n       no option left at this point. To reset it again, history would show would\n\n                                             19\n\f      only -- would be a futile effort, because at the eleventh hour with the\n      seven th and eighth attorneys representing you, there would be some\n      other effort, in my opinion, s ome o ther ma nipulation on you r part that\n      wou ld then cause those attorneys to come in and want to get off your\n      case. And then we’d reset it and appoint the ninth and tenth attorneys,\n      and the eleventh and twe lfth. And the re’d be n o end to it.\n      ...\n              And so we ’re goin g forw ard an d you ’re goin g to represent\n      yourse lf. I understa nd you ’re not an e xperien ced attor ney. I\n      understand you may well have never gone through a voir dire process\n      before. And that’s unfortunate. I wish you had cooperated and gotten\n      along with M r. Nan ce a ye ar and a half a go. He was a n exc ellent\n      attorne y, has tried m any, m any c ases in thes e cou rts, serio us diffic ult\n      cases and done an excellent job.\n              I wish you had cooperated and gotten along with Coleman\n      Garrett who, in my opinio n, is on e of the best tria l attorne ys in this\n      entire state. He’s tried many cases in this courtroom and defended\n      individ uals re mark ably w ell.\n              I wish y ou ha d coo perate d and gotten along with M r. Craig\n      Morton, and Mr. Glen Wright, and Mr. Harry Sayle, and Mr. William\n      Massey, beca use I th ink it would’ve been in your best interest to have\n      done so. But it’s been obvious that you have not. And so for that\n      reason we’re going forward.\n      ...\n              It’s not easy to make this decision. It’s not a decision that I made\n      lightly or take ligh tly. But I tell you wh at, if this record isn’t com plete\n      enough and replete enough with evidence of manipulative conduct and\n      obstructionism, then I can’t imagine ever there being a record for the\n      appellate courts in Tennessee that would meet that criteria.\n\n\nThe record indicates that in an effort to waive any conflict with Massey representing\n\nhim at trial Carruthers wanted to take the stand to apologize and te stify that the\n\naccusations he mad e against cou nsel earlier were untrue. The court noted that this\n\nwas m erely ano ther tactic C arruthers was us ing and denied the requ est.\n\n\n\n       On January 9, 1996, this Court filed an addendum to its previous order and\n\nordered that Massey be completely relieved of any representation of Carruthers,\n\nincluding providing assistance as “elbow counsel.” On January 11, 1996, during voir\n\ndire, the state requested a trial continuance due to the hospitaliza tion of one of its\n\nmaterial witnesses. Th e court resche duled trial until April 15, 1996 . Carruthers\n\nmade an oral request for appointment of new counsel. The trial court denied the\n\nrequest, reiterating w hat it had stated ea rlier:\n\n\n\n              The system will not be held hostag e by To ny Car ruthers, a nd to\n       go throug h ano ther ro und o f attorne ys will be doing just that, because\n       history suggests, as you’ve done in the past, that is if new attorneys\n       were appoin ted and spent the time and investigated, the effort to get\n       ready on this case, then at the eleventh hour something would happen,\n       some allegation s would be ma de that w ould un dermin e their ability to\n       represent you, they’d ask to withdraw, we’d be back in the same\n\n                                            20\n\f       situation that we were in with Mr. Larry Nance, with Mr. Coleman\n       Garrett, with Mr. Bill Massey, all three of whom are outstanding criminal\n       defense attorney s. All three of who m we re fully capable of representing\n       you, and all three of whom had to be relieved because of your actions.\n              And in my judgment, enough is enough. And because of your\n       actions, these attorneys are no longer representing you and, therefore,\n       you will be representing yourself. You have ample time to prepare.\n       You have access to legal opinion from Mr. Sayle. You have the file.\n       You have the rules. You have a jury consultant. You have an\n       investigator. And this is the manner in which we’re going forward.\n\n\n       On January 19, 1996, the trial court entered orde rs allowing Ca rruthers to hire\n\na jury selection consultant and an investigator. During a hearing on January 16,\n\n1996, the appellant informed the court that he had contacte d a new investiga tor to\n\nassist him. The court talked to this new investigator about the nature of the case and\n\nquestioned whether he would be able to proceed to trial on April 15, 1996. The\n\ninvestigator informed the court that he had discuss ed the m atter with the appellant\n\nand was in the process of assem bling an in vestigative team. He stated that he had\n\nthe files that had already been prepared and indicated that he would complete the\n\ninvestigation by that date. The court allowed John Billings to assist the appellant\n\nand authorized Billings to contact the court if additional funds were needed. The\n\ncourt also cautioned the appellant that this would be the last investigator appointed\n\nin this case.\n\n\n\n       In February 1996, Carruthers filed two more written motions for appointment\n\nof counsel, which were also denied by the trial court for the same reasons mentioned\n\nearlier.   In a hearing on February 20, 1996, the court recounted the lengthy\n\nprocedural history of this case and cited several federal opinions discussing a\n\ndefen dant’s forfeiture of counsel due to defendant’s hostile actions. The court stated\n\nthat “it will be apparent to anyone who objectively views this situation th at Mr.\n\nCarruthers is not being denied right to cou nsel.” Also during the hearing on the 20th,\n\nthe court entertained some of Carruthers’s pretrial requests for expert services and\n\ndiscovery. Although appellan t represe nted him self at this po int, the reco rd reflects\n\nthat the trial judge continued with a professional approach in this matter and made\n\ninformed decisions after allowing the appellant ample opportunity to make his\n\nargum ents in open court on his pretrial requests. The record suggests that the judge\n\nprovided Carruthers with added guidance and granted him and his investigator\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fcons iderab le latitude during the pre trial hearings. Hearing dates were continued\n\nseveral times to allow the appellant additional time to prepare for his arguments .\n\nMoreov er, at times when Carruthers requested an ex parte hearing, the state\n\nvoluntarily left the courtroom so the appellant could speak freely to the judge.\n\n\n\n      The court eve ntually allow ed Say le to withdr aw as e lbow co unsel du e to\n\nappe llant’s lack of tr ust an d con fidenc e in co unse l and his personal attacks against\n\nSayle. The court denied Carruthers’ motion for court paid accident reconstruction\n\nservices, but granted h is request for a forensic p atholog ist. On March 4, 1996, the\n\ntrial court entered an order denying another request by Carruthers for appointment\n\nof coun sel. Als o on March 4, the court heard arguments from Carruthers on all of\n\nthe remaining p retrial motions he h ad filed. As the trial court no ted and as the record\n\nreflects, the appellant filed various pretrial motions that appear to be similar or the\n\nsame as those filed by counsel before they were allowed to withdraw. In addition,\n\nthe record reflects that the appellant obtained the assistance of another attorney to\n\nprepare som e of the se m otions on his beha lf. The a ppella nt inten ded to retain th is\n\nattorney to represent him, but apparently this never materialized. Among these\n\nmotions are motions for severance, individual voir dire, suppression of evidence, and\n\ngeneral discovery reques ts. Incidentally, once the court removed the final attorney\n\nfrom Carruthers’’s cas e, counsel for M ontgom ery started m oving the cou rt for a\n\nseverance. In fact, almost every time the court held a pretrial hearing on one of\n\nCarru thers’’s requests, cou nsel for Mon tgomery re newed their motion for a\n\nseverance. These were denied.\n\n\n\n        Anoth er oral m otion fo r appo intme nt of co unse l was d enied on Ap ril 15,\n\n1996, the day jury s election s tarted. After trial, Carruthers filed yet another motion\n\nfor appointment of counsel. The trial court appointed Stephen Leffler and Lee\n\nFilderman to represent appellant on the motion for new trial and direct appeal to this\n\nCourt. Even after new counsel were appointed, Carruthers still insisted on filing pro\n\nse motions in the trial court. Appellant also wrote letters to the trial judge about\n\nissues he wanted to raise in the motion for new trial and witnesses he wanted to call.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fHe also complained to the trial court that his new counsel were inexperienc ed to\n\nhandle a capital case.\n\n\n\n                                       FACTS\n\nGuilt Phase\n\n       The victims, Marcellos Anderson, Delois Anderson, an d Frederick T ucker,\n\nwere murdered sometime between the evening of February 24, 1994, and the\n\nmorning of February 25, 1994.

Harris learned early Friday morning, Fe bruary\n\n25, that his Jeep was d estroy ed by fire in Mississippi. Harris testified that Anderson\n\nstayed with him sometimes during the week and that he would loan Anderson his car\n\nonce or twice a week. H e testified, ho weve r, that he did not know what Anderson\n\ndid for a living.\n\n\n\n       At about 2:40 a.m. o n Feb ruary 2 5, 199 4, Arch ie Yancey, an officer with the\n\nDeso to Coun ty, Mississ ippi She riff’s Depa rtment, o bserve d wha t appea red to be a\n\n“Jeep vehicle ” engu lfed in fla mes in a field a bout tw elve m iles south of the\n\nTennessee-Mississippi state line. According to Officer Yanc ey, the way th e veh icle\n\nwas burning suggested that it may have been torched.\n\n\n\n       Jean Tucker testified that her son, Frederick Tucker, was seventeen years old\n\nwhen he was killed. Sh e last saw him around no on on Feb ruary 24, 1994. Tucker\n\nalso testified that her oldest son , Andre Tuc ker, was m urdered on January 13, 1995.\n\n\n\n       Ola Jean Anderson was a friend of Marcellos Anderson. She testified that she\n\nsaw Ander son with James and Jonathon Montgomery sometime around 4:30 p.m.\n\non Thursday afternoon, the 24th. Ola Jean Anderson was standing on the street\n\ntalking to Anderson, who was in a white Jeep with another person, when\n\nMontgomery and his brother approached and got into the Jeep.\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f      Lave nthia Denise Anderson Briggs is a niece of Delois Anderson and c ousin\n\nof Marcellos A nderson. B riggs lived with Delois and Marcellos Anderson. She\n\ntestified that she did not know what Marcellos did for a living, but she d id state that\n\nhe had been shot in July 1993. Briggs telephoned Delois at home from a friend’s\n\nhouse shortly after 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. Someone answered the phone but did not\n\nspeak. Briggs testified that she said “hello” several times but received no response.\n\nShe hung up the phone and tried calling back, but no one answered the phone.\n\nBriggs went home about thirty minutes later and noticed that Delois had been there\n\n“because her thin gs we re ther e and she h ad left h er food .” Brigg s assu med Delois\n\nwou ld be back soon because she left her car, purse, cigarettes and keys. Briggs\n\nwent to sleep and was awoken about 3:30 a.m. b y a ph one c all from Mich ael Ha rris\n\nasking if Delois was home . She ha d not retu rned, no r was M arcellos h ome. A\n\nmissing person repo rt was filed the next day. Briggs testified that Marcellos wore a\n\n“big diamo nd ring,” a watch and a beeper. She also testified that a pillow case was\n\nmissing from Delois’ bed.\n\n\n\n      Charles Ray Smith, a convicted felon, testified on behalf of the state. In the\n\nfall of 199 3, Sm ith was incarc erated at the M ark Lu ttrell Re ceptio n Cen ter in\n\nMemphis. Appellants Carruthers and Montgomery were also incarcerated there at\n\nthat time. According to Smith, sometime during the early part of November 1993,\n\nSmith and Carruthers were on work detail together at the cemetery where the victims\n\nwere discovered. Part of their duties included placing coffins in the grave sites.\n\nAccording to Smith, at som e point Carruth ers stated “that would be a good way, you\n\nknow, to bury somebody, if you’re going to kill them. He said, you know, he sa id,\n\nyou know, if yo u ain’t got n o body , you don ’t have a case.” Smith testified that he\n\nheard Anderson brought Carruthers back to jail from furlough one day. Montgom ery\n\napparen tly saw Anderson with Carruthers.         Smith overheard Montgomery ask\n\nCarruthers about A nderso n.       Smith testified that he he ard C arruth ers tell\n\nMontgo mery both Anderson and Andre “Baby Brother” Johnson dealt drugs and had\n\na lot of money. Carruthers said when he and Montgomery got out of prison they\n\ncould rob and “ge t” Anders on and Johns on.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      Smith further testified that upon his release, he approached Anderson and\n\nJohnson and told them what he had overheard.           Thereafter, Montgomery was\n\nreleased and Smith saw him on the street sometime in January 1994. “When I had\n\nseen him, he told me that, you know, [Johnson] is trying to get me killed because\n\nhe sa id I went back and told [Johnson] that he supposed to be robbing them, what\n\nhe told me.” Smith testified that he saw James and Jonath an Mo ntgom ery get into\n\na white Jeep Cherokee with Marcellos Anderson and Fred Tucker on February 24,\n\n1994. Smith also sa w Jonatha n Montgo mery “han ging around ” by him self from\n\nabout 5:00 to 6:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n      Smith testified that h e receive d a call from Johns on arou nd 4:00 a.m. on\n\nFebruary 25, 1994. Johnson said Anderson was missing and asked Smith if he had\n\nseen him. Smith, Andre Tucker and Johnson drove around looking for Anderson.\n\nSmith testified the y saw ligh ts on at Ja mes M ontgom ery’s hou se, so w hen Sm ith\n\nreturned home around 5:00 a.m. he telephon ed Mo ntgom ery, desp ite the fact that\n\nhe and Montgomery did not have a friendly rela tionship. Carruthe rs answered the\n\nphone and Sm ith asked to talk to M ontgo mery . Smith aske d Mo ntgom ery if he knew\n\nAnde rson’s whereabouts because he was the last on e he sa w with h im. Smith also\n\ninformed Montgomery that Anderson’s Jeep was found burned in Mississippi.\n\nAccording to Smith, Montgomery said he did n ot feel lik e talkin g, that “W e’ll talk\n\ntomorrow,” and hung up the phone.\n\n\n\n      On cross-examination, Smith acknowledged that he did not have a good\n\nrelation ship with Jame s Mon tgome ry. Smith could no t remem ber the s pecific da te\n\nhe heard Carruthers and Montgomery talking about Anderson.              Nor could he\n\nremember if there we re any o ther inm ates pre sent du ring the co nversa tion. Sm ith\n\nalso acknowledged on cross that prior to h is relea se from prison in the fa ll of 1993\n\nhe and Carruthers “had a fallout” and did not “talk much anymore” because he\n\nlearned that Carruthers and Montgomery “was plotting to do something” to him.\n\n\n\n      Nake ita Montgomery Shaw testified that her cousins, James and Jonathan\n\nMontgomery, and Anderson and Tucker stopped by her house to visit around 4:30\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\for 5:00 p .m. on Febru ary 24 , 1994 . They arrived in a white Jeep Cherokee. Benton\n\nWes t, another of Shaw’s cousins, and Shaw’s four children were also present in the\n\nhouse. Shaw testified that the four men entere d the house and went down to the\n\nbasem ent. James then came back upstairs and asked Shaw if she could leave the\n\nhouse for a while so he could take care of some business. West, the children, and\n\nShaw all left the house. West told Shaw that he would never visit her again if James\n\nwas in the house.\n\n\n\n      When Shaw returned later that evening, Carruthers and James M ontgom ery\n\nwere the on ly individuals she saw in her ho use. M ontgo mery aske d if she could\n\nleave for a little longer. When she returned home again, sometime before 10:00\n\np.m., James M ontgom ery and C arruthers were still the re. The w hite Jeep, how ever,\n\nwas gone, and Shaw did not see or hear Anderson or Tucker. Shaw testified that\n\nMontgo mery told her to put her kids to bed upstairs and stay there until he said\n\notherwise. When M ontgom ery told her he w as leaving sh e went ba ck down stairs\n\nand saw Montgomery, Carruthers, Anderson and Tucker w alk out the front doo r.\n\nShaw locked the front door behind them. She testified that the Jeep had returned\n\nto the front of her house. The next m orning, Jam es, Jonatha n, and Ca rruthers\n\nreturned to Shaw’s house.\n\n\n\n      After the po lice star ted the ir inves tigation in this ca se, Ja mes Mon tgom ery told\n\nShaw that she did not have to talk to the police about a nything. Montgomery also\n\ntold her later that if he was going to be put to death for something he did not do, then\n\n“all of us needed to die.”     Shaw testified that she subsequently moved to her\n\nmoth er’s in Milwaukee with her children and Jonathan Montgo mery because she had\n\nreceived death threats. In early April, Shaw was questioned by the Milwaukee\n\nPolice Department regarding the evening of February 24, 1994. She informed the\n\nofficers of Jonathan’s whereabouts. When she was questioned by the Memphis\n\nPolice Department at a later date, she mentioned that Anderson and Tucker’s hands\n\nwere tied behin d their bac ks whe n they left h er hous e. She testified that she has\n\nbeen afraid for he r life, and during her testimony she stated that she did not see\n\nAnderson and Tucker restrained in any manner. She informed the police that James\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fMontgo mery threate ned h er and told her she could be an accessory. Montgom ery\n\nalso told Shaw that he did not w ant to have to h urt her.\n\n\n\n      On cross-e xamin ation, Shaw testified that she was not afraid of James\n\nMontgo mery but, be caus e of he r involv eme nt in this case, she was still scared. She\n\ntestified that James was living with her in February 1994, and that it was not\n\nuncommon for him to come and go as he pleased. James also brought friends by\n\nthe house occasionally. Shaw testified that she did not care for Anderson, because\n\nhe dealt drugs, and told Ben West that she did not want Anderson in her house.\n\n\n\n      Benton West was a t Shaw ’s house on Feb ruary 24 , 1994. H e testified th at\n\naround 5:00 p.m. James and Jonathan Montgomery, Anderson and Tucker stopped\n\nby the house in a Jeep. West spoke to Anderson and then all four men walked\n\ndownsta irs to the basement. West testified that a couple of minutes later Shaw\n\ncame into the kitch en and told him th at she th ought “they” were being kidnapped.\n\nWest then took Shaw’s children and left the house. West saw Sha w two da ys later,\n\nand she sta ted, “I hope didn’t noth ing happen to them or no thing like that.” On\n\ncross-examination, West testified that he did not see any weapons or notice anything\n\nunusual about the four men as they came inside the house. He also testified that\n\nShaw never told him she was afraid of Anderson or that s he did not want him in her\n\nhouse.\n\n\n\n      Jimmy Lee Maze, Jr., another convicted felon, testified on behalf of the state.\n\nMaze received two letters from Carruthers in the summer of 1993 while Carruthe rs\n\nwas incarcerated. In the first letter, Carruthers mentioned he had “a master plan”\n\nand “all the right ideas and the support to back it.” In his second letter, he stated he\n\nwas trying to get transferred to Mark Luttrell Reception Center. He also wro te: “I\n\ncan’t wait to make tho se streets pay me”; “If you really want to be rich, take time out\n\nwhen you ge t out to listen to my plans and goals”; “Everything I do from now o n will\n\nbe well organized and extremely violent”; “I have big plans for us and th ere isn ’t\n\nanything they can do about it”. Maze also testified that in December 1993, he and\n\nhis brother and Carruthers were riding around together. They happened upon a\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fscene where a car had been s hot in front of Delois Anderson’s house. Jonathan\n\nMontgo mery was at the scene, and when they arrived Montgomery got in the back\n\nseat of the car w ith Carruthers. Maze testified that Carruthers said “it would be the\n\nbest time to kidnap M arcellos,” once Ja mes M ontgom ery was relea sed from custody.\n\nWhen Montgom ery asked w ho Carruthe rs was talking about, Anderson or Johnson,\n\nMaze observed Carruthers bump Montgomery with his elbow. A couple of weeks\n\nlater, on New Year’s night, Maze saw Ca rruthers loading three an tifreeze containers\n\ninto a car. Maze got in the car with Carruthers, and as he was about to light a\n\ncigarette, Carruthers told him not to do it because there was gasoline in the\n\nantifreeze containers.\n\n\n\n      Terre ll Adair, a convicted felon, testified that prior to his incarceration he was\n\ninvolved in the sa le of coc aine w ith Ma rcellos Ande rson a nd An dre Jo hnso n. Ada ir\n\nwas present when Charles Ray Smith warned Anderson and Johnson about\n\nCarruthers and Montgomery.          Sometime in February 1994, Carruthers and\n\nMontgom ery approached Adair and Johnson on the street. Montgomery asked\n\nJohnson and A dair “why did we feel like he was trying to do something, something\n\nto one of us, because if he was trying to do something to us he would come around\n\nand kill our whole family.” Montgomery told Adair and Johnson that he already had\n\nsomeone else targeted, an d that he wa s going to take th is person’s money and\n\ndrugs. Montgom ery also sa id, “if the p olice d idn’t have no body, they wouldn’t have\n\nno case.” Adair s tated th at this was the first time he met Montgomery. Adair also\n\ntestified that Anderson always wore an $1,800 ring. Adair admitted to having been\n\nshot during a drive-by shooting, allegedly something to do with the drug business.\n\nHe also stated that Anderson had previously been shot in a drive-by shooting.\n\n\n\n      Andre Johnson (“Baby Brother”) testified that he, Marcellos Anderson and\n\nTerre ll Adair were best friends and sold cocaine together. According to Johnson,\n\nAnderson was known to carry about $5,000 or $6,000 cash on his person. Johnson\n\nalso stated that Anderson had about $57,000 stored in his mother’s attic. Johnson,\n\nAnderso n and Ad air all wore similar rings. Jo hnson testified tha t when C arruthers\n\nwas released from jail in the fall of 1993, he, Anderson and Adair each gave\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fCarruthers $200, which apparently was customary when someone they knew was\n\nreleased from jail. Johnson stated tha t Anders on trans ported C arruthers to and from\n\njail when he was released on furlough. Johnson testified that after Carruthers was\n\nreleased from jail Charles Smith warned him, Anderson, and Adair to watch out for\n\nCarruthers and Montgomery. Johnson said Anderson did not take Smith’s comment\n\ntoo seriously. According to Johnson, Anderson acted friendly toward Carruthers and\n\ntrusted him. Johnson also testified that he saw Montgomery after he was released\n\nfrom jail. Montgomery stated “this is my neighborhood” and asked Johnson whether\n\nhe want ed to g o to “w ar” ove r it. Mon tgom ery als o told J ohns on, so metim e later in\n\nfront of Johnson’s house, “we already got our man staked out . . . If we wanted some\n\ntrouble or som ething, we go t you right now. W e’d kill your whole fam ily.”\n\n\n\n       On cross, Johnson also admitted he had been shot during a drive-by shooting.\n\nAnderson had also been shot in a similar manner. Johnson also testified that he and\n\nhis asso ciates had p reviou sly been involved in a drug war with a rival organization\n\ncaused by differences in pricing. Upon questioning by Carruthers, Johnson stated\n\nthat when Carruthers was released from jail he mentio ned so methin g to him about\n\na master plan and making a million dollars in about two months.\n\n\n\n       Chris Hines had known the appellants since junior high school. About 9:00\n\np.m. on February 24, 1994, Jonathan Montgomery visited Hines at his home. Hines\n\ntestified that Jonathan told him he killed some people and stole their money; he said,\n\n“Man, a n----r got them folks . . . Cello and them.” Jonathan said “Man, we got them\n\nfolks out at the cem etery on Elvis P resley, and w e got $200 ,000.” Jonathan asked\n\nHines to take him to the cemetery. Hines refused, but allowed Jonathan to borrow\n\nhis car. Although Jonathan said he would return the car in an hour, Hines did not\n\nsee it again until the next morning. Hines also testified that he called James\n\nMontgo mery about 11:00 p.m. that same night. Hines wa s looking for his car.\n\nJames told him he did not know where Jonathan was, but that he would probably not\n\nget his car back until about 4:00 a.m. beca use J onath an ha d to driv e Jam es to h is\n\ngirlfriend’s house. Jonathan, James and Carruthers eventually returned his car\n\naround 8:30 a.m. the n ext mo rning. Th e car wa s mud dy but the three de fendan ts\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\ftook the car to clean the exterior and vacuum the interior, including the trunk. Hines\n\ntestified that Jo natha n told h im again the morning of the 25th that they killed some\n\npeople.   According to Hines, Jonathan was paranoid and nervous. Jonathan\n\nappa rently left the carwash and Carruthers and James asked Hines what Jonathan\n\nhad told him. Hines said Jonathan told him nothing. Several days later James\n\noffered Hines an AK-47 assa ult rifle for his protection. James said the gun had\n\nblood o n it, which w as slang mean ing som eone h ad bee n shot w ith it.\n\n\n\n      On cross-examination, Hines stated that when the three defendants returned\n\nhis car the next morning, James and Carruthers left. Hines stated that he saw\n\nJames and C arruthers about 2 ½ hours later, at which point James asked Hines why\n\nhis car was so muddy. Hines testified that James told him he would take him to get\n\nhis car washed as soon as he got h is check . Hines sta ted that his car was dirty\n\nwhen he let Jonathan borrow it. Hines further testified on cro ss tha t Jona than to ld\n\nhim that “I had to kill them folks.” He stated that Ja mes aske d him what Jonathan\n\nhad told him and said that they needed to find out what Jonathan had done. Hines\n\nalso stated on cross that neither James nor Carruthers directed the man washing the\n\ncar to clean an ything in particular.\n\n\n\n      Orlandus Buddy Sesley, an employee with the Tennessee Department of\n\nCorrection, testified about the op eration at the M ark Luttrell Recep tion Center in\n\nMemphis, where he wa s statione d. The reception Center serves as a processing\n\ncenter for prisoners before they are transported to or released from the various\n\npenitentiaries across the state.        Sesley worked as a counselor assisting and\n\norientating prisoners back into society before their release. Sesley counseled the\n\nappellan ts and Charles Ray Smith .        Carruthers was released from custody on\n\nNovember 15, 1993, Smith on December 15, 1993, and Montgomery on January 11,\n\n1994. Sesley testified that both Sm ith and C arruthers were a ssigned to work release\n\nat a graveyard before their release from custody. Sesley further testified that\n\nCarruthers was rem oved from the ceme tery deta il in Octobe r and give n light duty\n\nwork inside because of a medical problem with his hand or wrist. Sesley authorized\n\nfurloughs for inmates which allowe d a prison er to leave custody for three d ays to\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fmake arrangements for release. Carruthers was granted three furloughs, the last\n\noccurring October 1, 1993. Sesley testified that Montgo mery arrived at the Mark\n\nLuttrell Reception Center on November 4, 1993.\n\n\n\n      On March 3, 1994, Detective Jack Ruby of the Memphis Police Department\n\naccompanied Jonathan Montgomery to the Rose Hill Cemetery on Elvis Presley\n\nBoulevard. Jonathan directed Detective Ruby to the grave site of Dorothy Daniels,\n\nwho wa s buried on F ebruary 25, 199 4. This gra ve site was located six plots away\n\nfrom James Montgome ry’s cousin ’s grave site.         Ruby obtained a court order\n\npermitting disinterment of the casket from this grave. Along with the police officers,\n\ntwo anthropologists and two medical examiners assisted in the removal of the\n\nbodies. The ca sket containing the body of Daniels was located in a plywood box\n\ninside the grave. Below this box, underneath several inches of dirt, they found\n\nanother single piece of plywood. The bodies of the three victims were discovered\n\nundern eath this piece of plywood lying in a pit that had been dug further down in the\n\ndirt. The two male victims were on top of the fe male victim and all three victim s were\n\nbound.\n\n\n\n      Patrick Williams, an employee of the Rose Hill Cemetery, testified that it would\n\nhave taken two people to remove the empty plywood box that was found in Daniels’\n\ngrave. This box was placed in the grave the day before the casket was lowered,\n\nwhich would have bee n during wo rking hours on February 24, 199 4. Acco rding to\n\nDr. Hugh Edward Berryman, one of the forensic anthropologists who assisted with\n\nthe crime scene, the casket of Daniels had not been disturbed after she was buried\n\non the 25th.\n\n\n\n      Dr. O.C. S mith pe rformed the autop sies in this case. He als o ass isted in\n\nremoving the bodies from the grave site. Dr. Smith testified that the fema le victim\n\nwas in the bottom of the grave and the two male victims were found lying on top of\n\nher. The hands of all three victims were tied behind their backs and, in addition, the\n\nfeet of Frederick Tu cker were bound. Delois Anderson also had a red sock around\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fher neck and F reder ick Tu cker’s neck showed signs of bruising caused by a ligature.\n\nDr. Sm ith did not find any jew elry on M arcellos A nderso n.\n\n\n\n       Delo is Anderson died as a result of asphyxia caused by a combination of\n\nfactors: 1) difficulty in breathing due to the position of the body, i.e., her head was\n\nbent forward and he r chin wa s presse d again st her che st, 2) dirt in the mouth and\n\nnose blocking the airflow , and 3 ) traum a from the we ight on her bo dy. Th is victim\n\nalso suffere d traum a befo re she was p laced in the g rave. D r. Sm ith opin ed tha t this\n\nvictim was strang led two to six hou rs before dea th. Also, the victim suffere d a more\n\nrecent wound to the back of her head which could have been caused by a blow from\n\na shovel. She also showed bruising on the elbows, the back of the left shoulder, and\n\nthe forehead, possibly caused when she hit her head o n the bo ttom of the grave.\n\n\n\n       Frederick Tucker received a near gunshot wound to his chest which was not\n\ninstan taneo usly fatal. He also suffered blunt trauma to his abdomen and head,\n\nwhich includ ed bro ken rib s, a frac tured s kull and a rupture d liver. Dr. Smith opined\n\nthat Tucker was shot and then placed in the grave where the force of compression\n\nfrom being buried produced the other injuries and ultimately cause d his death. Dr.\n\nSmith further opined that Tucker was alive when he was placed in the grave. Tucker\n\nalso sho wed sig ns of stran gulation.\n\n\n\n       Marcellos Ander son rec eived thre e guns hot wo unds: a contact wound to his\n\nforehead, which was not that severe, and two gunshot wounds to the neck, one a\n\nnear shot severing his spinal cord and paralyzing him from the chest down. None\n\nof the gun shot wo unds, h owev er, were instantaneously fatal.            Anderson also\n\nsuffered blunt traum a to his ab dome n from b eing bu ried in the g rave.\n\n\n\n       Dr. Smith opined that each victim was buried alive.\n\n\n\n       Appe llant Montgom ery presente d no proof, ho wever, app ellant Carruthers\n\ncalled several witnesses to testify on his behalf. Albert James Herm an, Jr., a health\n\nadministrator at Mark Luttrell Reception Center, testified that on October 6, 1993, the\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fappellant was gra nted a job chang e beca use of an injury to his le ft hand. Freddy L.\n\nMcCullough, a private investigator assigned to this case, interviewed Jimmy Maze\n\nprior to trial. According to McCullough, Maze knew Carruthers was talking about a\n\nmaster plan in his letters, but Maze did not know specifically what Carruthers was\n\ntalking about until Carru thers was re leased from jail (apparently beca use the letters\n\nCarruthers w rote to Maze did not go into de tails or mention na mes).\n\n\n\n       Alfredo Shaw gave a state men t to the p olice in March 1994. Shaw stated that\n\nhe saw a television news report about this case and called crime stoppers to provide\n\ninformation. Some time be fore the m urders, Shaw testified that he was in a three-\n\nway telephone conversation with Carruthers and either Terry or Jerry Durham.\n\nCarruthers told Shaw he had a “sweet plan” and that they would each earn $100,000\n\nand a kilogram of cocaine. Shaw told Carruthers, however, that he did not want to\n\nget involved. Shaw was in the same jail with the appellants after they were arrested\n\nfor these crimes. Shaw testified that Carruthers told him how the crimes w ere\n\ncommitted. Carruthers said he and some other people (he apparently did not\n\nmention the other appellants by name) went to Delois Anderson’s house looking for\n\nMarcellos and h is mone y. Marc ellos w as no t there s o Car ruther s told D elois to call\n\nMarcellos and tell him to come ho me, “it’s some thing importan t.” When Marcellos\n\narrived, the ap pellan ts force d the v ictims (appa rently Tucker arrived with Marcellos)\n\ninto the Jeep at gunpoint and drove them to Mississippi where they shot Marcellos\n\nand Tucker and burned the Jeep. The appellants then drove all three victims back\n\nto Mem phis in a sto len vehic le. Accord ing to Sh aw, Ca rruthers s tated they drove to\n\nthe cem etery a nd pu t Marc ellos a nd Tu cker in the gra ve. De lois started screaming\n\nso one of the appellants told her to shut up or she would die like her son, and then\n\npushed her in the grave . Shaw testified ab out this information b efore the gran d jury\n\nin this case.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers told Sha w that he was no t going to hire an attorney because then\n\nthe state might have learned that they planned the murders in order to steal\n\nMarcellos’ mone y. Carruthers also said th e bod ies wo uld ha ve ne ver be en fou nd if\n\n“the boy wouldn’t have went and told them folks.” Carruthers informed Shaw that\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\fJohnson was also supposed to be “hit.” Carruthers also stated that two other\n\nindividuals, Terry and Jerry Durham, were “the main people behind having these\n\nindivid uals killed.” Apparently the Durhams wanted revenge because they had\n\nprevio usly been ro bbed b y Marc ellos and Johns on. Shaw testified that he feared for\n\nhis safety for having come forward with this information because the Durhams had\n\ncontrol over people who were in jail along with Shaw. Shaw testified at trial that he\n\nattempted to recant his gran d jury testimony and statem ent to th e polic e bec ause his\n\nand his family’s safety was threaten ed by Ca rruthers. Appa rently, Carruthers made\n\narrange ments through one of his investigators to ha ve a new s reporter intervie w\n\nShaw about his recantation. The Durha ms tes tified on be half of Ca rruthers a nd both\n\nindividuals stated that they did not know Shaw nor had they heard of him.\n\n\n\n       Aldolpho Antonio Jame s testified that he was w ith Car ruther s at a frie nd’s\n\nhouse betwe en 1:00 a.m. an d 2:00 a .m. the day before James first saw a news\n\nreport about this case. On cross-examination, however, James admitted that he did\n\nnot know th e date of this enc ounter.\n\n\n\n       Terrance Roderick Carruthe rs, the a ppella nt’s bro ther, tes tified tha t Terre ll\n\nAdair was sh ot in a drive -by sho oting in D ecem ber 199 3. He further testified that he\n\nwent to the hospital later that day with Carruthers, Marcellos Anderson, and And re\n\nJohnson to see Adair. According to his testimony, Jonathan Montgomery was not\n\npresent at the sce ne nor a t the hosp ital. Carruth ers also c alled An tonio Ba teman to\n\nthe witness stand who testified that he did not see Jonathan Montgomery at the\n\nhospital a fter Adair w as sho t.\n\n\n\n       An administrative assistant with the Shelby County Jail testified that Shaw was\n\nnot in the law library of the jail at the same time as Carruthers in February or March\n\n1994. The co nversa tion Carru thers ha d with Shaw allegedly took p lace in the jail\n\nlibrary. Carruthers also called several employees of the Shelby County Jail who\n\ntestified about the various classifications of prisoners and how certain prisoners,\n\nsuch as those in protective custody , are segregated at all times from other\n\nclassifications of prisoners. Some of these employees admitted, however, that this\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\fsystem is not foolproof and that there could be tim es when inmates with different\n\nclassifications could come into contact with one another. Carruthers and Shaw had\n\ndifferent classifications.\n\n\n\n\nSentencing Phase\n\n       During the Sentencing phase of the trial, the state introduced evidence of the\n\nappellants’ prior convictions. Carruthers had a previous conviction for aggravated\n\nassa ult, wh ile Mo ntgom ery ha d two previo us co nvictio ns for ro bbery with a d eadly\n\nweapon and one for assault with intent to commit robbery with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe state also called the medical examiner back to the s tand to testify a bout th e pain\n\nsuffered by the victims.         Dr. Smith testified that none of the victims died\n\ninstantan eously. Each victim s uffered as a re sult of th eir sep arate in juries, a s well\n\nas from the sensation of being buried alive.\n\n\n\n       Nakeita Montgom ery Shaw testified on behalf of M ontgom ery during the\n\nsentencing phase. Shaw and Montgomery were close growing up together. Shaw\n\nstated that she loved her cousin very much and asked the jury to spare his life.\n\nMattie Calhoun, Montgomery’s aunt, testified that Montgomery was an average\n\nstudent in school. She also stated that Montgomery did not have a meaningful\n\nrelation ship with his father. She also begged the jury to spare his life. Mon tgomery\n\ntestified on his own behalf. Mon tgomery a nd his three bro thers and two sisters were\n\nraised by his mother in North Memphis. Montgom ery stated that he was five yea rs\n\nold when he las t saw h is father, w ho wa s still living in M ississip pi at the time o f trial.\n\nHe testified that he pled guilty in his prior cases because he wa s guilty. He testified,\n\nhoweve r, that he was innocent in this case. He stated that he spent a little over nine\n\nyears in the penitentiary for his previous convictions and had secured a job when he\n\nwas r eleas ed. M ontgo mery ’s son w as ten years old at th e time of trial.\n\n\n\n       Bishop R.L. Fiddler had been visiting with Carruthers since his incarceration.\n\nFiddler believed Carruthers was honest and straightforward and a person of quality\n\nand worth. Fiddler stated that Carruthers was upset about the deaths of the victims\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fin this case. Fiddler asked the jury to give Carruthers a chance to live. Tonya\n\nYvette Miller, Carruthers’ sister, testified that their mother raised four children on her\n\nown.   Miller st ated th at they grew up in o ne of th e wor st hou sing p rojects in\n\nMemphis. Carruth ers, the old est son, h ad a lot of re spons ibility as the “man of the\n\nhouse hold.” She lov es her b rother, bu t admitted that he ha d a hot temper. Miller\n\nstated, however, that he never planned to do anything wrong . She told the jury that\n\nher mother raised her children to tell the truth. Miller asked the jury to spare\n\nCarruthers’ life because he is innocent of these crimes. Carruthers took the stand\n\non his ow n beh alf. He to ld the ju ry he was innocent of the crimes and did not\n\ndeserve to die.\n\n\n\n                                       ANA LYSIS\n\nForfeiture of Right to Counsel\n\n       In his first issue, Carruthers claims he was denied his right to due process\n\nwhen he wa s forced to represe nt himse lf during the trial of this capital case. The\n\nstate argues in response that Carruthers forfeited his right to counsel. It is not\n\ndisputed that Carru thers is ind igent.\n\n\n\n       An indigent defendant has the constitutional right to appointed counsel. U.S.\n\nCons t. amend. VI; Tenn . Const. a rt.

It\n\ncan also be distinguished from an implied waiver of the right after having been\n\nwarned that se lf-repre senta tion m ay follo w if the prohibitory condu ct continu es. See\n\nGoldberg , 67 F.3d at 1100. In the case of an implied waiver, the defendant has\n\nbeen cautioned against future conduct and has been informed of the consequences\n\nof his actions. In the case of forfeiture, there may have been no warnings given by\n\n\n                                            38\n\fthe court. In both cases, however, the defendant has not voluntarily waived counsel\n\nnor indica ted that he wishes to proce ed pro s e.\n\n\n\n      In the case at hand, after denying Massey’s motion to withdraw b ut prior to\n\nthis Court’s order on extraordinary appeal, the trial court, referring to some of the\n\nabove-cited federa l law, sta ted tha t Carru thers h ad tw o optio ns rem aining: either\n\nproceed to trial with the assistance of Massey and Sayle or proceed on his own.\n\nThis statement would sugge st that an im plied wa iver resulte d. How ever, as to\n\nMassey, this Court allowed Massey to withdraw shortly after the trial court warned\n\nthe appe llant, an d there fore, the result is more akin to a forfeiture since counsel was\n\nremoved without any additional egregious conduct by Carruthers directed at Massey.\n\nRegarding Sayle, however, Carruthers did engage in additional egregious conduct\n\nresulting in Sayle’s removal. Because the forfeiture of a constitutional right is the\n\nmost severe sanction, the defendant’s conduct leading up to the forfeiture must be\n\nextrem ely dilatory. Id. at 1101. The Goldberg court suggests that an implied waiver\n\n(waiver by conduct) could be based on conduct less seve re. Id. We believe,\n\nhowever, that in either case, the forfe iture of counsel or the implied waive r of\n\ncounsel, since the defendant is not voluntarily giving up one of his basic,\n\nfundamental cons titutiona l rights, th e defe ndan t’s con duct m ust be so ext reme ly\n\negregious and dilatory that the trial court has no other option but to force the\n\ndefendant to proceed pro se. The sanction imposed should be appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances and commensurate with the nature and extent of the de fenda nt’s\n\ncondu ct. Again, the asse rtion of th e defe ndan t’s rights must be weighed against the\n\neffective and efficie nt adm inistration of ju stice. See Leavitt, 608 F.2d at 1293. The\n\ncourts canno t permit de fendan ts to abus e their rights to the detriment of the system.\n\n\n\n      We have not been able to find any capital cases involving the forfeiture of the\n\nright to couns el. Cf. Wate rhouse v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1765514\"><a href=\"/opinion/1765514/waterhouse-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1008</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1992) (defendant\n\nconsidered to have forfeited right to counsel during closing argument of resentencing\n\nhearing in capital ca se). And w hile we are cognizant of the heightened due process\n\nconcerns in death penalty cases, we also recognize that courts cannot be\n\nhandcuffed by the whims of the defendants. Although we are not bound by the\n\n\n                                           39\n\fdecisions of the lower federal courts, after carefully reviewing the record in this case,\n\nwe are persuaded by the reasoning of these decisions concerning forfeiture of the\n\nright to counsel. “We believe th at there m ust be so me lim it to the defe ndant’s a bility\n\nto manipulate the judicial system even if he is unknow ing and uninte lligent.” Gallop,\n\n838 F.2d at 110.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers’ conduct regarding his relationship with Massey has been\n\nthorou ghly outlined above. After Massey was removed from the case completely,\n\nthe court allowed Sayle to remain as “elbow” counsel. The record indicates that the\n\nappellant wished to recan t the accu sations h e mad e towa rd Mas sey. The court,\n\nhoweve r, said enough was enough. As noted above, Sayle was also finally allowed\n\nto withdraw completely from the case . Even after Carruthers lost the assistance of\n\none of his two remaining attorneys, he still continued with his conduct toward Sayle.\n\nThe court had warned Carruthers that he could either cooperate with Massey and\n\nSayle or lose his right to counsel. Apparently, neither the removal of Massey nor the\n\ntrial court’s w arning p ersuad ed Ca rruthers. W hen Sa yle finally m oved th e court to\n\nbe allowed to quit as elbow counsel, he made the following statements:\n\n\n\n               He has expressed the feeling that I am not working for him, and\n       that I have not done anything for him, I’m not going to do anything for\n       him. He suspe cts -- he ’s ma de it cle ar that h e sus pects that I’m\n       working with the sta te in som e capa city. And frankly none of the advice\n       I give h im is followed, and I don’t think there is any intention of following\n       it. And frankly it’s just -- and the abuse ge ts extremely person al.\n       Personal vilification over the last couple of meetings, and I see no ba sis\n       for being able to continue.\n\n\n       The threats C arruthers made in his letters and c alls to M asse y clear ly\n\nthreatened physical violence . Com ments about what type of car Massey’s daughter\n\ndrove and the ability to discover the color of Massey’s toothbrush could be taken no\n\nother way. Carru thers also accused Massey of abusing drugs. The comments and\n\naccusations Carruthers made toward Craig Morton and Coleman Garrett, were much\n\nmore personal. Though the threats of physical violence are not as apparent, we do\n\nnot believe any attorney in Tennessee could work under the abhorrent conditions\n\ncreated by Carruthers. These letters were written in June and July of 1995. Garrett\n\nand Morton were relieved as counsel in late July 1995. These letters were in a\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\fsealed exhibit in the record. They shall remain sealed, and out of respect to the\n\nattorneys involved, we will not reveal the nature of the comments which these\n\nattorneys could rightfully consider outrageous.\n\n\n\n       We have previously quoted extensively from the numerous pretrial hearings.\n\nDuring the hearing on Garrett and Morton’s motion to withdraw, the trial judge\n\nreferred to the outrageous accusations Carruthers made against his attorneys.\n\nHowe ver, the judge did not recite anything specific from these letters. Nor will we,\n\nexcept to say that n o attorne y shou ld have to tolerate the ho stile an d unc omfo rtable\n\natmosph ere created by Carr uthers. The letters to Garrett and Morton indicate that\n\nCarruthers’ conduct was not limited to his relationship w ith Massey . There is simp ly\n\nno evidenc e in the rec ord to su pport any of Carru thers’ accusa tions. This Cou rt\n\nfound on extraordinary appeal that Massey was entitled to withdraw. This was at\n\nleast the fifth attorney appoin ted to rep resent C arruthers who w as allow ed to\n\nwithdraw because o f the ho stile en vironm ent cre ated b y Car ruther s.            Say le\n\nsubs eque ntly was allowed to withdraw for similar reasons. We do not believe this\n\nhistory of abuse would have ceased if yet another set of attorneys were appointed.\n\n\n\n\n       In fact, the history predates this case. The trial judge noted that in a previous\n\ncase, Carruthers had gone through four sets of attorneys. In this respect, we take\n\nnotice of the fact that the de fenda nt wa s con victed of agg ravate d ass ault in 1 990 in\n\na case in whic h he was appointed four successive attorneys due to his continuing\n\ndis-satisfaction with cou nsel. The last attorne y was a ppointe d less tha n a mo nth\n\nbefore trial and was the object of the d efend ant’s u nsuc cess ful pos t-conv iction cla im\n\nof ineffec tive as sistan ce of c ouns el. See Tony V. Carruthers v. State, 02C01-9505-\n\nCR-001 30, Shelby C ounty (Ten n. Crim. App . Apr. 17, 1996 ).\n\n\n\n       As noted above, a criminal defendant does not have the right to a meaningful\n\nrelation ship with his counsel, nor the right to choose which counsel shall be\n\nappointed.

Counsel, whether appointed\n\nor not, are trained and licensed professionals who are req uired to abide by cer tain\n\nstandards in the performance of their duties. Similarly, the defendant does have the\n\nabsolu te right to make certain choices during his trial. Counsel, however, cannot\n\nsimp ly acquiesce to every single demand or request of the defendant which does not\n\naffect the exercise of certain absolute rights. The Post-Conviction Procedure Act\n\nwas created to add ress any of th e defe ndan t’s con cerns abou t coun sel’s\n\nreprese ntation.\n\n\n\n       Given the history of this ca se, wh ich ha s bee n thoro ughly summarized above,\n\nit is clear to us that C arruth ers w ould not have been satisfied with any attorney and\n\nwas simply trying to manipulate the system. Even after the court appointed counsel\n\nfor the mo tion for new trial and ap peal, Ca rruthers wrote several letters to the trial\n\njudge insisting that his new attorneys were incompetent. We do not believe the trial\n\ncourt interfer ed with the ex ercise of Car ruther s’ cons titutional rights.            After\n\ncons iderab le time and consideration, the trial court properly weighed the effective\n\nand efficient adm inistration of ju stice aga inst Carru thers’ right to couns el. As the trial\n\ncourt observed, Carruthers was the author of his own predicament. Again, there has\n\nto be a point when the courts are permitted to stop the abuse and delay tactics\n\nemployed by a criminal defendant under the guise of his or her constitutional rights.\n\n\n\n       We do not take lig htly the result that a defendant has to proceed pro se in any\n\ntrial, especially one involving a capital offense. Our judicial system could not survive\n\nif those accu sed o f crime s wer e literally run over “roughshod.”            But while the\n\nindividual must be protected by the system, the judicial system must also be\n\nprotected from abuses by an individual. A person charged with criminal acts cannot\n\nbe allowe d to su bvert th e judic ial syste m. Ap pellan t Carru thers w as, in effect, given\n\none last cha nce fo r assis tance of counsel after Massey was allowed to withdraw;\n\nSayle remained as “elbow” counsel for a period of time until he, too, was allowed to\n\nwithdraw due to C arruthers ’ conduc t. The removal of Sayle came after Carruthers\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fwas clearly warned by the trial court that his conduct could result in him being\n\nrequired to proceed pro se at trial. A reversal of a conviction and a rem and for a\n\nnew trial is done with the appellate court having confidence that the new trial will\n\ncorrect the previous error. We concur with the trial court’s judgment in this case that\n\nno matter how man y time s Car ruther s mig ht be a llowed to hav e cou nsel, h e wou ld\n\ncontinue his egregious conduct to force counsel off the case until ultimately, again,\n\nhe would have to proceed pro se. Carruthers is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n\n\n        The appellant also claims that because he was forced to represent himself the trial judge did not\n\ntreat him fairly or in the same manner as an attorney. Carruthers argues this was prejudicial error\n\nrequiring a new trial. Having reviewed each of the numerous instances cited by appellant on appeal in\n\nthis respect, we do not believe the trial court denied the appellant a fair and impartial trial. When this\n\nCourt allowed Massey off the case, Carruthers expressed his concerns to the trial judge about\n\nproceeding pro se. The judge stated that this was unfortunate but reminded Carruthers that he placed\n\nhimself in this position. The Court assigned Massey and Sayle as elbow counsel and informed the\n\nappellant that they would provide assistance and advice during trial. Shortly thereafter, however, this\n\nCourt ruled that Massey was to be completely removed from any involvement in this case. Carruthers\n\nagain asked for appointment of new counsel, but the judge denied this and stated that Sayle would\n\nremain to assist. Even at this point, when the appellant had expressed concerns about proceeding to\n\ntrial without counsel, he still persisted with his antics which eventually led to the removal of Sayle from\n\nservice as elbow counsel.\n\n\n\n        While a pro se litigant is not held to the same strict standards as a practicing attorney, see, e.g.,\n\nBaxter v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769614\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769614/baxter-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1975), because he is proceeding without the assistance of\n\ncounsel does not mean the court must completely ignore the procedural and substantive rules of law.\n\n“This Court does bend over backwards with pro se litigants to make sure they are treated fairly.\n\nHowever, we cannot bend the rules until they break. Otherwise, our system lacks consistency and\n\nhonesty.” State v. Allen, No. 01C01-9510-CC-00338 (Tenn. Crim. App., Oct. 29, 1996), perm. to app.\n\ndenied, (Tenn., May 12, 1997). The appellant must realize that although he was conducting his own\n\ndefense, given the nature of the charges against him he remained in protective custody and was bound\n\nby certain limitations not endured by an attorney. These limitations would necessarily be more evident\n\nwhen there were heightened security concerns in a case such as this. Accordingly, because of these\n\n\n                                                    43\n\flimitations inherent in his status as a pro se litigant, Carruthers certainly could not exercise all of the\n\nprivileges of an attorney not confined in a jail cell.\n\n\n\n        Carruthers enjoyed the services of a jury selection expert and an investigator who could assist\n\nin any matters Carruthers could not accomplish from the confines of his cell. The appointment of an\n\ninvestigator, however, was not a substitution for counsel. Carruthers remained a pro se litigant.\n\nImmediately prior to the start of trial in April, after a continuance from January, Carruthers requested\n\nadditional time in order to retain counsel. The trial court denied any further continuances. Contrary to\n\nthe appellant’s claim that he was denied sufficient time, we agree with the trial judge that this was\n\nanother in a long line of delay tactics by Carruthers. Furthermore, because Carruthers had the files from\n\nhis previous attorneys, and because the trial was continued three months after he began to represent\n\nhimself, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Carruthers did not have ample opportunity to\n\nprepare his case.\n\n\n                 One of the most fundamental responsibilities of a trial court in a criminal case\n        is to assure that a fair trial is conducted. See, e.g., State v. Burkhart, [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1765195\"><a href=\"/opinion/1765195/state-v-burkhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n        371 (Tenn. 1976)]. Generally, the trial court, which has presided over the proceedings,\n        is in the best position to make determinations regarding how to achieve this primary\n        purpose, and absent some abuse of the trial court’s discretion in marshaling the trial, an\n        appellate court should not redetermine in retrospect and on a cold record how the case\n        could have been better tried.\n\nState v.

Obviously, the better practice would be to proceed with counsel. But as in this case,\n\nwhere the defendant consistently abused his right to counsel and had to proceed pro se, the pro se\n\ndefendant will not necessarily perform as well as an experienced attorney and may invariably make\n\ncertain mistakes. However, this alone is not cause for a new trial. As long as the judge ensures that\n\na fair and impartial trial is conducted, the mistakes and ill-advised strategy decisions are merely\n\nbyproducts of self-representation. We have carefully reviewed each of appellant’s assignments of error\n\nduring trial. The trial judge in this case was extremely understanding and forgiving. This is not to say\n\nthat the trial judge allowed Carruthers to conduct his defense without regard for maintaining orderly\n\nproceedings. While the judge was more lenient in the application of the rules of law, he did not, nor was\n\nhe required to, allow Carruthers free reign in the courtroom. Having completely reviewed the record in\n\nlight of all of Carruthers’ claims in this respect, we find that the appellant was afforded a fair and impartial\n\ntrial. A new trial is not required.\n\n                                                      44\n\f       Carruthers claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.

Crim. App.\n\n1995). This claim is without merit.\n\nConso lidation of Ind ictments\n\n       Appe llant Carru thers claim s the trial cou rt erred by not requ iring the sta te to\n\nelect upon w hich indictm ents it intend ed to pro ceed u pon at trial. In March 1994,\n\nboth appe llants w ere orig inally indicted on three counts of first degree murder.\n\nSubsequently, in Novem ber 1995, bo th appellants w ere indicted o n three c ounts of\n\nespe cially aggravated kidna pping and o ne co unt of e spec ially aggravated robbery.\n\nAll of these offenses arose from the same criminal episode and involved the same\n\nthree victims . The tria l date in this matter wa s originally schedu led for Februa ry\n\n1995, prior to the return of the second set of indictments. Howe ver, due mainly to\n\nCarruthers’ cond uct reg arding coun sel, the trial wa s eve ntually contin ued several\n\ntimes until the Spring of 1996.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers contends that the murder indictments should have been dismissed.\n\nBecause the state was not forced to elect between the two indictments, according\n\nto the appellant’s argument, he “could not reasonably have known whether he was\n\ndefending murder charges or charges of kidnapping and robbery .” The appellant\n\nfurther claims that if the trial court had followed “normal procedure,” he would have\n\nnever been tried on the murder charges. The state disagrees and asserts that the\n\nappellant was properly tried on all charges.\n\n\n\n        Tenn.R.Crim.P. 8(a) (emphasis added) regarding mandatory joinder of\n\noffenses provides:\n\n\n\n       Two or more offenses shall be joined in the sam e indictm ent,\n       presentm ent, or information, w ith each offense stated in a sepa rate\n       count, or consolidated pursua nt to Rule 13 if the offe nses are based\n       upon the sa me c ondu ct or aris e from the sa me c rimina l episo de an d if\n       such offense s are known to the appropriate prosecuting official at the\n       time of the return of the indictm ent(s), presentm ent(s), or information(s)\n       and if they a re with in the ju risdictio n of a s ingle c ourt. A defen dant s hall\n\n\n                                                  45\n\f        not be subject to sep arate tr ials for m ultiple o ffense s falling within th is\n        subsection unless they are severed pursuant to Rule 14.\n\n\nThe A dvisory C omm ission C omm ents to R ule 8 furthe r provide , in pertinen t part:\n\n\n        This rule is designed to encourag e the disposition in a single trial of\n        multip le offenses arising from the same conduct and from the same\n        criminal episode, and should therefore promote efficiency and\n        economy. Wher e such joinder of o ffenses m ight give rise to an\n        injustice, Rule 14(b)(2) allows the trial court to relax the rule.\n\n        The Commission wishes to make clear that section (a) is meant to stop\n        the practice by some prosecuting attorneys of “saving back” one or\n        more charges arising from the same conduct or from the same criminal\n        episode. Such other charges are barred from future pros ecutio n if\n        known to the appropriate prosecuting official at the time that the other\n        prosecution is commenced, but deliberately not presented to a grand\n        jury.\n\n\n        Carruthers’ argume nt ignores the basic premise behind the Rule.                    The\n\npurpose of Rule 8 is to promote efficient administration of justice and to protect the\n\nrights of the acc used. The ru le clea rly perm its a sub sequ ently returned indictment\n\nto be joined with a previous indictment where the alleged offenses relate to the same\n\ncriminal episode . See King v. S tate, 717 S .W.2 d 306 (Tenn . Crim . App. 1 986). T his\n\npractice, howeve r, does have certain limitations which, as the comments note,\n\nsafeguard an accused against prosecutorial abuse. For example, a prosecutor\n\ncannot simply decide to “save” charges on other offenses arising out of the same\n\nconduct until after a trial is had on the original charges. Obvio usly, th is wou ld resu lt\n\nin multiple trials and prejudice the defendant. This concern, however, is not present\n\nin the case at hand because the subsequent indictments were returned well before\n\nthe sta rt of trial.\n\n\n\n        Although the re is no written trial court order cons olidatin g the in dictm ents in\n\nthis case, not only w as co nsolid ation m anda ted by the rule s, it was clearly\n\nunderstood by the court and all parties involved in this case. As soon as the 1995\n\nindictme nts were re turned, th e appe llants filed a motion to dismiss. After a hearing\n\non December 19, 1995, the trial court denied the motion, and the matter proceeded\n\non all charges. In fact, counsel admitted that they k new th ey wer e going to trial on\n\nthe murder charges; they moved to dismiss the new charges. Carruthers’ claim that\n\nhe did not know what charges the state was prosecuting is wholly without merit. Not\n\n\n\n                                               46\n\fonly did the appe llant file a motio n to dis miss the subsequent charges, which was\n\ndenied, the sty le of the pleadings and orders filed in this case after the return of the\n\n1995 indictments, includ ing letters Carruthe rs wrote to h is attorney , refer to both the\n\n1994 and 1 995 in dictm ents. M oreov er, jury s electio n had alread y starte d in ea rly\n\nJanuary 1996, when the state moved for a continuance. There certainly was no\n\nconfusion as to charges being tried when a jury was again selected and trial finally\n\nbegan three mon ths later in April 1996. A ll of the indictments w ere read to the jury\n\nat the b eginn ing of th e trial.\n\n\n\n       As this Court observed in King,\n\n\n\n       We do not perceive that any evil results from subse quent ind ictmen ts\n       being returned against a defendant charging him with additional\n       offenses which are based on the same conduct or which arise from the\n       same criminal episode upon which prior indictments have been\n       returned; when the defendant has not been tried on any of the offenses\n       at the time the subsequent indictments are return ed. As previo usly\n       noted, the purpose of Rule 8 is to prevent multiple trials on charges\n       arising from the same conduct or from the same criminal episode\n       except under the circumstances stated in the rule.\n\n\n717 S.W.2d at 308 . To follo w the appe llant’s su gges tion in this cas e wou ld resu lt in\n\nthe non-prosecution of three murder charges. Surely this type of windfall was not\n\ncontemplated by the drafters of the Rules. The appellant has simply failed to show\n\nhow he wa s unpre pared to defend on kidnapping and robbery charges that stemmed\n\nfrom the same criminal episode in which three individuals were killed.\n\n\n\nGrand Jury Proceedings\n\n       Carruthers also claims that the murder indictments should have been\n\ndismissed becau se of “the a dmitted ly questio nable tes timony presen ted to the grand\n\njury in suppo rt” of them . Accord ing to Carruthers, the bad faith of the prosecutor by\n\nrefusing to call Alfredo Shaw as a w itness at trial, de spite h aving relied u pon h is\n\ntestimony to sec ure the murd er indic tmen ts, nec essa rily implies that the grand jury\n\nprocess was corrupted. The state denies that the murder indictments are invalid.\n\nThe appellant also cla ims he should have been entitled to the transcript of these\n\ngrand jury proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                            47\n\f       As noted above, Alfredo Shaw testified before the grand jury about the\n\ncircumstances of the murders related to him by Carruthers in jail.                  The state,\n\nhoweve r, indicated that it did not intend to call Shaw as a witness during trial\n\nbecause they had some concerns about his credibility due to criminal conduct after\n\nthe grand jury testim ony. D espite this, Ca rruthe rs him self called Shaw as a witness\n\nand Shaw conveyed to the jury the same information he reportedly told the grand\n\njury. Shaw testified that he previously attem pted to recant h is grand jury testimony,\n\nbut inform ed the jury this was b ecau se his a nd his family ’s safety was threatened by\n\nCarruthers. Accordingly, the “admittedly questionable testimony” the appellant\n\ncomplains about was explained away.\n\n\n\n       Nevertheless, the appellant’s claim must fail. It has long been the rule of law\n\nthat the sufficiency and legality of the evidence presented to a grand jury is not\n\nsubject to judicial rev iew. State v. Gonzales, 638 S.W .2d 841, 845 (Tenn.

Also without merit is the\n\nappe llant’s claim that he should have been prov ided a transcript of the grand jury\n\nproceeding in this instan ce. See Rules 1 6(a)(3) an d 6(k), Te nn.R.C rim.P.

Th e Cou rt must still\n\ndetermine the relevance of the evidence and weigh its probative value against any\n\nundue prejudice.\n\n\n\n       The appellant argues that the letters are irrelevant because they were written\n\ntoo far in advance of the actual murde rs and d o not refe r to the victims or mention\n\nhow the money would be made. He also suggests that the letters are improper\n\nevidence of othe r crimes or wrongdoings. After a jury-out hearing as to whether\n\nthese letters should be admitted, the trial court made the following findings:\n\n\n\n             But the proof itself, I think, goes directly towa rd esta blishin g this\n       one additional link, one additional factor in establishing, from the Sta te’s\n       perspective, the existence of a conspiracy. It’s very relevant, in my\n       judgm ent.\n\n              It talks about a m aster plan. It talks abou t having the sup port\n       personnel lined up. It talks abo ut having the ma npow er lined up . It\n       talks about “joining with me” and g etting w ith the p rogra m, in effect, and\n\n                                            49\n\f       “get with me when I get out.” And it makes reference to the fact that he\n       is trying to get transferred to MLRC, Mark Luttrell Reception Center,\n       which then ties in to the testimony that Charles Smith gave, which\n       wou ld -- of having overheard some conversations along these line [sic]\n       as we ll.\n\n              You know, again, the jury may not believe any of it, and that’s up\n       to the jury. O r they m ay believ e it all. But it all ties in, a nd it all tie s\n       together. The letters tie in with what Mr. Smith testified to.\n...\n\n             And again, this is additionally why these matters need to be\n       heard during the trial and not pretrial, because I now have the be nefit\n       of havin g hea rd Ch arles Smith’s testimony and having heard other\n       testimony now that Mr. Maze is now on the stand, and I can better\n       judge how his testimony fits in with all of the other testimony.\n\n\n       The trial judge clearly explained how the se letters w ere relev ant to the issues\n\nbeing tried, and having reviewed the transcript of the jury-out he aring, we are\n\nsatisfied that the jud ge did no t abuse his discre tion in adm itting these letters into\n\nevidence. Their probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. This\n\nissue is w ithout me rit.\n\n\n\nStatement of Co-Conspirator\n\n       Next, Carruthers claims that the testimony of Hines relating what Jonathan\n\nMontgo mery told him was inadmissable hearsay. The state counters by arguing\n\nthese statemen ts were adm issible under the c o-conspirator exception to the hearsay\n\nrule. See Tenn.R.E vid. 803(1.2)(E).\n\n\n\n       Hearsay, which is “a statem ent, other than one made by the decla rant w hile\n\ntestifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserte d,” Rule 801(c), is not admissible at trial except as provided by the Rules of\n\nEvidence or otherwise by law. Rule 802. A statement made by a coconspirator of\n\nthe defendant “during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy” is one of\n\nthe exceptions to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(1.2)(E). However, before this type of\n\nhearsay may be admitted, certain conditions must be met: 1) there must be\n\nevidence of a conspiracy involving the defendant and coconspirator; 2) the\n\nstatement must be made during the pendency of the conspiracy; and 3) the\n\nstatement mus t be m ade in the further ance o f the cons piracy.

The Court found that the statement merely related\n\nthe circumstances of the robbery and killing and were not made during a further\n\nconspiracy to conce al the circu mstan ces of the crime. Id. It would follow then that\n\nif there is evidence of a further conspiracy a fter the fact to conceal the crime, any\n\nstatement by a coconspirator made during the course of and in further ance of this\n\nfurther conspiracy may be admis sible aga inst the de fendan t. Id.; see also State v.\n\nHenry, No. 01C01-9505-CR-00161 (Tenn. Crim.

Id. (citing Gaylor, 862 S.W.2d at\n\n554 (where conspiracy to commit murder did not end until victim’s insurance\n\nproceeds were collected )). We also noted that the Supreme Court in Walker did not\n\nexplore the relationship, if any, between the Rules of Evidence and T.C.A. § 39-12-\n\n\n                                           51\n\f103, the cons piracy sta tute, whic h provide s that the c onspira cy includ es efforts to\n\nconceal the crime or to obstruct justice in relation to it. The Court suggested that the\n\ncoconspirator exception to the hearsay rule should be examined under the law as\n\nit existed prior to the enactment of the conspiracy statute because of subsection (g)\n\nof that statute, which p rovides th at “[n]othing in this provis ion is intend ed to m odify\n\nthe evidentiary rules allowing statem ents of co -consp irators in furth erance of a\n\nconsp iracy.”   However, there may be some relationship between the Rules of\n\nEvidence and the criminal s tatute if the de fendan t is specifica lly charge d with\n\nconsp iracy, wh ich is not the case he re. See Henry.\n\n\n\n       The question in this case then becomes whether the statements made by\n\nJonathan Montgomery were made either when the defendants were concealing the\n\nmurders to achieve the objectives of the crimes or duri ng a furth er cons piracy to\n\nconceal the murd ers. To fall under this hearsay exception, the statements by the\n\ncoconspirator must advance in some way the objectives of the conspiracy and not\n\nsimp ly be “casual conversation” about the crime s. State v. Hutchinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432566\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432566/state-v-hutchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 0 (Tenn . 1994).\n\n\n\n       We agree w ith the state that Montgomery’s first statement to Hines falls under\n\nthis hearsay exception. Harris’ Jeep was fo und b urned in Mississippi. The victims\n\nwere buried alive in a cem etery in M emph is. Trial tes timon y indica ted tha t it would\n\nhave taken approximately two people to remove the plywood vault that lined the\n\ngrave site under which the victims were buried. The jury could reasonably have\n\ninferred that when Jo nathan M ontgom ery asked Hines to take him to the cemetery,\n\nthe victims had not yet been buried and Jonathan was needed to assist the other two\n\ndefendants. Moreove r, the jury could have reasonably inferred since Hines’ car was\n\nmuddy when returned that it was taken to the cemetery.                The testimony and\n\nvideotape reveal that the cemetery grounds did contain muddy areas.                  Since\n\nJonathan was n eede d to co mple te the ro bbery , kidna pping s and murd ers, his\n\nstatement to Hines that he killed some folks and needed a ride to the ceme tery\n\nadvanced the conspiracy and w as no t mere ly a na rrative s tatem ent to H ines. W hile\n\nwe find that the sta tement was admissible, we do not agree with the particular\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\fargument the sta te adv ance s in support thereof. Montgomery told Hines, “Man, we\n\ngot them folks out at the cemetery.” Since the victims were allegedly already at the\n\ncemetery, we can not agre e with the state th at the car w as nee ded to transport the\n\nvictims there.\n\n\n\n       Jonathan Mon tgom ery’s n ext sta teme nt alleg edly came after the bodies we re\n\nburied. The state argues that this statement was made during the concealment of\n\nthe conspiracy.     Whether or not the concealment of the crimes furthered the\n\nobjectives of the original conspiracy, there was certainly evidence of a further\n\nconspiracy to conceal the commission of the c rimes . Mon tgom ery co uld have been\n\nconnected to Hines’ car and the mud from Hines’ car could have been traced to the\n\ncemetery where the v ictims were discov ered. T he qu estion , how ever, is whether the\n\nsecond statement furthered in some way the objectives of the conspiracy or was\n\nmere ly a narrative statem ent of pas t condu ct. Apparently, while Montgomery and\n\nHines were standing around waiting for the car wash, Montgomery told Hines they\n\nkilled some people. We do not believe Montgomery made this statement during or\n\nin furthe rance of the c onsp iracy to conc eal ev idenc e of the crime s. It is mo re akin\n\nto “casual conv ersation” about past events and should not have been admitted.\n\nBecause Jonathan M ontgom ery’s first statement w as adm issible, we find, how ever,\n\nthat the erroneous admission of the second statement was harmless. The content\n\nof the sec ond sta temen t mirrored that of the first.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers also claims that he shou ld have been allowed to question Detective\n\nRuby about the content of Jonathan Montgomery’s statements to the police. The\n\nstate argues that this hearsay testimony was properly excluded. In State v. Walker,\n\n910 S.W.2 d 381, 3 86 (Ten n. 1995 ), the Sup reme C ourt held that a c onsp irator’s\n\n“statement to the police can hardly be in furtherance of the conspiracy. It becomes\n\nonly a narrative statement of past conduct between the conspirators.” The Cou rt\n\nnoted, however, that a confession to the police may fall under another exception to\n\nthe hearsay rule, such as a statement against pena l interes t whe n the d eclara nt is\n\nunava ilable. Id. at 385.\n\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\f       In this case, Jonathan Montgomery gave several varying statements to the\n\npolice. At first, he denied knowing anything about the crimes or being present at the\n\nscene. These statements would not fall under this exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn subsequent statements, he stated that he, the two appellants, and Bobby Wilson,\n\na fourth person not identified by any of the witnesses at trial, were all at the scene\n\nof the crime. In one statement, he said Bobby Wilson shot one of the victims but he\n\ndid not know who shot the other (only two of the three victims were shot). Yet, he\n\ninformed the police in another statement that Carruthers and/or Montgomery shot\n\nthe victims.   Since Jonathan Montgomery placed himself at the scene of the\n\nmurders, these late r statem ents do appear to fall under this exception to the hearsay\n\nrule. Tenn .R.Ev id. 804 (b)(3). H owe ver, w e find th e erron eous exclus ion of th is\n\ntestimony to be har mless . See T.R.A.P . 36(b). The state ments clearly im plicate\n\nCarruthers and would have done more harm to his case.\n\n\n\nEvidence of O ther Perpetrators\n\n       Both appellants argue the trial court limited their ability to establish that other\n\npeop le involve d in the Mem phis d rug tra de ha d mo tives to kill the vic tims in this\n\ncase. Again, the adm issibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, and th is Cou rt will not interfere with that discretion absent a clear showing of\n\nabuse. See State v. How ard, 926 S.W .2d 579, 585 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1996 ).\n\nEvidence is relevan t if it has \"any te ndenc y to make the existence of any fact that is\n\nof cons eque nce to the de termin ation o f the ac tion m ore pro bable or less proba ble\n\nthan it would be withou t the ev idenc e.\" Ru le 401, Tenn.R.Evid.

The evidence must be the\n\ntype that would be admissible against the third party if he or she were on trial, and\n\nthe proof must be limited to facts inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt. State v.\n\nKilburn, 782 S.W .2d 199 , 204-05 (Tenn. C rim. App. 1989). Accordingly, hearsay\n\nevidence implicating another individual would not be admissible.\n\n\n\n      Having reviewed the record in light of the appellants’ claims, we find that the\n\ntrial court did not exclude any re levant ad missible evidenc e tending to implica te\n\nothers in the murders while exonerating the appellants. The jury was well aware that\n\nMarcellos Anderson was hea vily involved in the dru g trade in Mem phis. The jury\n\nheard evidence about Anderson’s drug dealings with Joh nson a nd Ada ir. The jury\n\nheard that Anderson and Adair had previously been shot by others in drive-by\n\nshootings. They heard that An dre Tu cker, th e broth er of on e of the victims in this\n\ncase, was subsequently killed after the appellants had been arrested on the present\n\ncharges. As the state notes, this evidence clearly suggests that the killings in the\n\ndrug world were still happening. The evidence the appellants refer to was either\n\nhearsay (testimony that Anderson was in debt to Colombian drug dealers) or\n\ncumulative and would have confused the issues and misled the jury (attacks on\n\nothers involved in the M emphis d rug trade). Aga in, the jury knew this case centered\n\naround activities in the drug world and they could reasonably have used their\n\ncommon knowle dge to co nclude that there w ere ma ny playe rs involve d.             The\n\nevidence in this cas e, how ever, p ointed to the g uilt of the appe llants. T his issue is\n\nwithout m erit.\n\n\n\nCompetency of Witness Nakeita Shaw\n\n       Carruthers next claims that the trial court erred by not ordering a competency\n\nevaluation of Nakeita Shaw. Prior to trial, counsel representing Carruthers at the\n\ntime requested an evaluation of Shaw and any records of a history of me ntal\n\ntreatme nt. The sta te indicate d that it had no reco rd of treatm ent. The trial court\n\ndenied the request. During the first jury selection, the state asked for a trial\n\ncontinuance because Shaw had checked herself into a hospital for depression and\n\ncould not appear in court. The court granted the continuance. Carruthers claims,\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\fhoweve r, that this fact should have been a compelling enough reason for the trial\n\ncourt to exercise its inherent power to order a competency evaluation.\n\n\n\n      In support of his claim, Carruthers relies upon State v. Garland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1739240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1739240/state-v-garland/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn.

See T.R.A.P . 36(a). We agree. Since the trial court did not\n\nhave the authority to orde r a mental ev aluation of Sha w, and be cause C arruthers\n\nfailed to preserve the issue, this matter has been waived. Regardless, even if Shaw\n\nhad been found to be mentally incompetent, she could have testified as long as she\n\nwas able to understand the obligation of an oath and had personal knowledge of the\n\nmatter to which she testified .

The state claim s he wa ived his righ t.\n\n\n\n       The trial judge originally scheduled the non-capital sentencing hearing for May\n\n20, 1996.    However, because of some confusion regarding transportation, the\n\nappellan ts were not brought to Memphis from the Riverbe nd Ma ximum Security\n\nFacility outside of Nashville. At this point, the court had already appointed counsel\n\nto represent Carruthers at the hearing on the m otion for ne w trial a nd on appe al.\n\nThe court reset the sentencing hearing for M ay 28, an d inform ed cou nsel for bo th\n\nappellan ts of this continuance . On May 28, the court decided , becau se of sec urity\n\nconcerns, that the sentencing hearing would be held at Riverbend the next day. The\n\ncourt again info rmed Carruthers’ counsel of this change, and stated that although\n\nthey could ap pear, the y would not have an active role in the h earing.

Just prior to the start of\n\nproceedings, the warden informed the judge that Carruthers said he was not going\n\nto participate . The appellants were apparently located in a different area of the\n\nprison than where the hearing took place. Counsel for Montgomery also informed\n\nthe judge that Montg omery was su rprised the hearing was go ing to take place and\n\nthat he, too, was not going to p articipate. Counsel stated that Montgomery was not\n\ngoing to participate becaus e of the presen ce of the me dia. The judge , however,\n\nrefused to exclude the media from the proceeding. The judge again asked the\n\nwarden to inquire wheth er Carru thers wa nted to be presen t. Carruthers, how ever,\n\ngave no reason other than to say he was not going to participate. The judge then\n\ndecided he was going to proceed without the presence of either appellant since they\n\nhad volun tarily elected to remain away. T he judg e stated th at the app ellants knew\n\nthis hearing was going to take place, however, he admitted they may have been\n\nsurprised about its location.\n\n\n\n      T.C.A. § 16-1-105 (1998 supp.) provides that\n\n\n\n      If for any caus e, in the op inion o f the co urt dee med sufficie nt, it is\n      impracticable or inconv enient for a ny cou rt to hold its se ssion at the\n      courthouse , or place design ated by law, it sha ll be lawful for the court\n      to hold its sess ion, or a ny pa rt of its se ssion , at any other ro om w ithin\n      the limits of the county seat, or at any other room op en to th e pub lic\n      within an institution of the department of correction or the department\n      of children’s services if the court deems it necessary, and all its\n      proceedings at such place, whether in civil or criminal cases, are as\n      valid as if done at the courthouse.\n\n\nThe trial court determined that it was necessary for security reasons to hold the\n\nsentencing hearing on the non-capital offenses at the prison outside Nashville. The\n\nroom used in the prison was open to the public, as the media w as there, and th ere\n\nappea rs to be no error in the tria l court’s judg ment in this respe ct.\n\n\n\n       Criminal defen dants have the righ t to be p resen t at all sta ges o f the trial,\n\nincluding sentencing.

Rule 43 also provides that\n\na defen dant c an wa ive his right to appear if, after present initially, he “[v]olun tarily is\n\nabsen t after the trial ha s com menc ed.”\n\n\n\n       In Muse, a case discussing whether or no t a defendant may waive the right\n\nto be presen t during jury voir dire, our Supreme Court acknowledged that there is a\n\nlong-standing presumption against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\n\n967 S.W.2d a t 767. The C ourt held that waiver would not be presumed from a silent\n\nrecord, and that in orde r for a de fenda nt to w aive h is or her right to be present during\n\nvoir dire, the defendant must personally waive the right in writing or on the record in\n\nopen court. Id. at 768. In Muse, the trial court rescheduled the jury selection at\n\ncoun sel’s request, but the d efendant w as personally unaware of this. When jury\n\nselection began a day earlier than originally scheduled, the defendant did not\n\nappear. The Sup reme C ourt remanded for a new trial because the defendant was\n\nnot informed of the rescheduling.\n\n\n\n       In this case, the trial judge admitted Carruthers may not have known that the\n\ncourt planned on visiting the prison. However, the judge stated that both ap pellants\n\nwere aware that a sentencing hearing was going to occur. In fact, the hearing had\n\norigina lly been scheduled the week prior in Memphis. The judge also made the\n\nfollowing comments for the record:\n\n\n\n              Obviously, since there has already been a thorough sentencing\n       hearing back in April, on April 26th, at the time that Mr. Montgomery\n       and Mr. Carruthers were found guilty by the jury on the murder charges,\n       the -- all three sides in the case, the state and both defendants, had an\n       opportu nity to present any and all proof they cared to at that time, w ith\n       regard to sentencing issues. . . . And so I would assume that all three\n       parties involved at that sentencing hearing would have presented any\n       and all relevant proof that they had available to them at that time with\n       regard to sentencing issues in this case.\n       ...\n              Now, on Mr. Carruthers’ behalf, since he’s not represented by\n       coun sel, it had been my intention to addres s him in c ourt toda y to see\n       if there was any additional proof that he wanted, that he perhaps was\n       missing out on since the matter was being held here. Since he has not\n       graced us with his presence, I haven’t h ad the o pportun ity to address\n       him today.\n\n                                              61\n\f       After makin g the latter c omm ents, the judge took a short recess to allow\n\ncounsel to confer with Montgomery and to allow the warden to inform Carruthers that\n\nthis was his opportu nity to ma ke a state ment o n his ow n beha lf, if he so chose.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery returned from their conference and again informed the\n\njudge that Montgo mery was o bjectin g to this hearin g bec ause it was n ot bein g held\n\nin a pub lic place . Coun sel spe cifically s tated th at, to the ir knowledge, they would not\n\nhave called any a ddition al witne sses at this h earing .       The w arden once again\n\ninformed the judge that Carruthers declined to participate. The warden made at\n\nleast three attempts during the hearing to secure Carruthers’ presence.\n\n\n\n       Given that the re had previo usly been an ex haus tive se ntenc ing he aring in this\n\ncase, the trial judge stated that he did not believe there would be any additional\n\nevidence presented by defen se tha t wou ld not have been cumulative. Of course, as\n\nprovided by the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, both the state and the\n\ndefendant have the right to pres ent relevant evidence at the sentencing hearing.\n\nSee T.C.A . §§ 40 -35-2 03(a) ; 40-35 -209( b). This includes the opportunity for the\n\ndefendant to make a statement on his ow n beha lf. § 40-35-2 10(b)(6) . Cf.

The trial court, however, would have\n\nbeen perm itted to e xclud e any evide nce th at had alread y bee n pres ented earlier in\n\nthe proceedings. § 40-35-209(b). Similarly, in imposing the sentences for the\n\nkidnapping and robbery convictions, the judge was required to consider anything\n\nalready in the record from the trial to date, including evidence from the capital\n\nsenten cing hea ring. § 40-3 5-210.\n\n\n\n       Counsel for Montgomery indic ated they were not aware of any additional\n\nwitnesses. And w hile the judge thoug ht it was highly unlike ly Car ruther s wou ld\n\nproduce any, the judge was willing to allow Carruthers the opportunity to present any\n\nadditional proof as well as make a statement on his own behalf. The record is silent\n\nas to whether Carruthers possessed any additional proof.                 If Carruthers had\n\nappeared at the hearing and requested a continuance so that he could forewarn any\n\nrelevant witnesses they would need to travel to Nashville, the trial court could have\n\n                                             62\n\fgranted a continuanc e. Howe ver, because we believe Carruthers waived his right\n\nto be pre sent, there was no error by th e trial court in th is respec t.\n\n\n\n       The facts of this case ca n readily be distingu ished from those in Muse. In\n\nMuse, beside not knowing about the change in dates, the defendant did not appear\n\nin court on the day tria l comm enced . Cf. State v. Robinson, No. 03C01-9512-CR-\n\n00410 (Tenn. Crim. App., July 16, 1997).            In the case at hand, although the\n\ndefendant may not have known about the change in time and place of the hearing,\n\nthe defendant was given every opportunity to appear before the judge at the prison.\n\nThis is not a case where the trial judge was going to proceed without even making\n\nan effort to secure the presence of the defendant. The defendant was housed in the\n\nsame facility where the hearing took place, and the warden informed him on at least\n\nthree separate occasions that the judge was going to proceed without him if he\n\nchose not to appea r. Carruthers did n ot personally appear before the judge and\n\nwaive his right to be presen t. Howeve r, the record before us clea rly reflec ts that th is\n\nwas his intention. We believe this scenario is akin to the situation where a defendant\n\nis initially present in the courtroom and then “[v]oluntarily is absent after the trial has\n\ncomm enced .” See Rule 43. Carruthers obviously knew the sentencing hearing was\n\nabout to begin but voluntarily chose not to participate. Given the discussion above,\n\nwe find that Carruthers waived his right to be present at the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\n\n       Both appellan ts claim the prosec utors m ade im proper a rgume nts during b oth\n\nphas es of th e trial w hich re quire a rema nd for a new tr ial.\n\n\n\n       As is commonly recognized, closing arguments are an important tool for the\n\nparties during the trial process.

As we noted earlier, there are certain perils a\n\ndefendant faces when repres enting hims elf at trial. Know ing whe n to object during\n\nargument obviously is one of those perils.

The judge\n\nshou ld intervene only when requested or when the judge deems proper in the\n\ninterest of justice.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers refers to several instances of allegedly improper argument that\n\noccurred during the guilt pha se of the trial. He claims the prosecutor imp roper ly\n\ncharacterized him as a conniver and liar and accused him of manipulating the jury.\n\nEvidence was introduced that Carruthers was the mastermind behind these crimes,\n\nand therefore, any referenc e by the s tate in this regard wa s not improp er. Howev er,\n\nthe prosecutor may not comment unfavorably upon the defendant’s pro se\n\nrepresentation of himself or the presen tation of his c ase. See Coke r v.

M oreove r, a prosecutor is strictly prohibited from commenting on the\n\ndefen dant’s decision not to testify. Coker, 911 S.W.2d at 368. This would include\n\nhis decision not to pres ent any proof. How ever, a prose cutor's statement that proof\n\nis unrefuted or uncontradicted is not an improper comment upon a defendant's\n\nfailure to testify. State v. Thomas, 818 S.W .2d 350, 364 (Tenn.

Cauthern ,\n\n967 S.W .2d 726, 737 (Tenn. 199 8).\n\n\n\n      In this cas e, it was improper for the prosecutor to call the appellant names,\n\nsuch a s a liar. However, we do not find improp er the co mm ents telling th e jury to\n\nwatch out for “pitfalls” and “mind games” and not to succumb to a “guilt trip.” The\n\nprosecutor was simply making reference to the strength of the state’s proof. Also,\n\nthe prosecutor should not have insinuate d that Ca rruthers w as trying to manip ulate\n\nthe jury or comment that Carruth ers did no t call any cre dible witne sses on his beha lf.\n\nContrary to Carru thers’ claim , howe ver, we d o not be lieve thes e com ments\n\nimpro perly referred to Carruthers’ failure to testify. Similarly, Carruthers complains\n\nabout the prosecutor’s statements that Carruthers was trying to manipulate the\n\nmedia. Howe ver, Alfred o Shaw testified abo ut this. Moreo ver, the sta te is permitted\n\nto argue reasonable inferences from th e evid ence in the reco rd. Coker, 911 S.W.2d\n\nat 368. The sta te’s argume nt in this respect wa s not improp er. Carruthers also\n\nclaims the state’s reference to the “second part” of Carruthers’ master plan\n\nmentioned in the letters he wrote to Maze was improper. Since this was brought up\n\nby the ev idenc e, we do no t think th is comm ent w as improper.        Carruthers also\n\nclaims the prosecu tor’s statement to the jury that they have a responsibility to the\n\nvictims’ family improperly appealed to the emotions and sympathies of the jury. See\n\nState v. Bigbee, 885 S.W .2d 797, 809 (Tenn. 199 4). We agre e. Finally, Carruthers\n\ncontends the prosecutor’s comment that there is a “gap” in the evidence was\n\nimproper. Carru thers c laims this wa s an im prope r inferen ce on his failure to testify.\n\n\n                                            65\n\fWe disagree. The state’s case was based on circumstantial evidence and the\n\nprose cutor’s comment in this respect merely informed the jury that not all the pieces\n\nto the p uzzle were prese nted a t trial.\n\n\n\n       Both appellants complain about certain comments made by the prosecutor\n\nduring argument at the penalty phase of trial. Both appellants take issue with the\n\nprose cutor’s mentio n of the ten comm andm ents in the Bible. Just recently, in State\n\nv.

A ccording ly, we do not believ e the com ments\n\nMontgomery complain a bout which contain these phrases w ere improp er.\n\nMontgomery asserts that the prose cutor improp erly read to the jury a d ictionary\n\ndefinition of the term “mitigate” and improperly asked the jury to use that definition\n\nto determine whether any mitigating evidenc e was p resente d.              Acco rding to\n\nMontgomery, the prosecutor erroneously told the jury that mitigating evidence is that\n\nwhich mitigates the crime , rather tha n that wh ich mitiga tes the pu nishm ent.\n\nAlthough the prosecutor may have not clearly provided the jury with the legal\n\nmeaning of mitigation , the trial judge prope rly instru cted th e jury a nd the jury is\n\npresumed to have fo llowed th ose instru ctions.

Crim . App. 19 92). Non etheless , we hav e review ed the e ntire\n\nargum ents of all parties, and considering the factors listed above, we find that the\n\nrelative ly few improper comments by the prosecutors did not affect the verdict to the\n\nprejudice of the appellants.       This issue is without merit.    However, we remind\n\ncounsel of the warnings recently related by our Supreme Court in State v.\n\nMiddlebrooks, 995 S.W .2d 550 , 561 (Te nn. 199 9):\n\n\n                                             67\n\f              Those who interpret these cases as precedent for the view that\n       improper closing argume nt and m iscon duct o f this na ture w ill be he ld\n       harmless error in all cases do so at their own professional peril and at\n       the risk that the misconduct, even if it does not prejudicially affect the\n       verdict, may be deemed to be prejudicial to the judicial process as a\n       whole a nd there fore requ ire a new trial or sente ncing he aring.\n\n\n\nGag Order\n\n       Next Carruthers claims the trial court erred by issuing a gag order before the\n\nstart of trial.   Carruthers contends the gag order, which prevented any of the\n\nattorneys or pro se litigants from making extra-judicia l statements about the case,\n\nadversely affected his ability to present a defense. Specifically, Carruthers claims\n\nthat the order may have prevented an important witness from coming forward.\n\n\n\n       On March 4, 1996, the trial court issued an order as follows:\n\n\n\n               The Constitutions of the United States and the State of\n       Tennessee guarantee defendants in all criminal cases due process of\n       law and the right to a fair an d impartial jury. It is the duty of the trial\n       court to see that every defendant is afforded all his constitutional rights.\n               In order to safeguard those rights, this Court is of the opinion that\n       the following rule is necessary to constitutionally guarantee an ord erly\n       and fair trial by an impartial jury. Therefore, this Court orders the\n       following:\n               All lawyers participating in this case , including a ny defe ndants\n       proceeding pro se, the assistants, staff, investigators, and employees\n       of investiga tors are for bidden to take par t in interview s for pub licity and\n       from makin g extra-jud icial statem ents ab out this ca se from this date\n       until such time as a verdict is retu rned in this case in o pen co urt.\n               Because of the gravity of this case; because of the long history\n       of concerns for the personal safety of attorneys, litigants and witnesses\n       in this case; because of the potential danger - believed by this Cou rt to\n       be very real and very present - of undermining the integrity of the\n       judicial system by “trying the case in the media” and of sullying the jury\n       pool, this Court feels compelled to adopt this extraordinary pretrial\n       measure. State v. Hartman , 703 S.W .2d 106 ([Tenn.] 1985), and State\n       v. Green, 783 S.W .2d 548 ([Ten n.] 1990).\n\n\n       Much of the procedural history of this case has been outlined previously,\n\nincluding the numerous threats to attorneys and the death of one of the co-\n\ndefendants. As Carruthers acknowledges in his brief, “[t]his trial was charge d with\n\nemotion from start to finish.       There were allegations of gang affiliations and\n\ntestimony of large scale narcotics dealings.           The courtroom was guarded by\n\nS.W.A.T. team mem bers a nd by Sher iff’s deputies who w ere auth orized to search\n\nthose entering the cou rtroom.” Furthermore, as the trial judge stated in a n in came ra\n\n\n                                             68\n\fhearing during the middle of trial on April 20, 1996, a deputy jailer had been gunned\n\ndown in the jailer’s driveway the day before and the judge expressed concerns that\n\nthere might be a connection to this case. He also noted that one witness fled and\n\ncould not be found after reading about this case in the newspaper. Further, the\n\njudge indica ted tha t two w itnesses who already testified stated that appellant\n\nMontgo mery threatened to kill them if they talked about this case. Alfredo Shaw\n\neven testified that Carruthers tried to make arrangements to have Shaw recan t his\n\ntestimony in front of the media.\n\n\n\n       This case was the subject of another interlocutory appeal to this Court,\n\nwhe rein we he ld that the trial court’s gag order on the media precluding them from\n\nprinting the nam e of a witness who already testified was an unconstitutional prior\n\nrestra int.

Mon tgomery , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996).\n\nAccordingly, the m edia was not exclud ed from these pr oceed ings and was free to\n\nreport anything about the case, including the events that transpired in the courtroom.\n\nThe gag order at issue here was directed at the attorneys, including the pro se\n\nlitigant. The trial court properly concluded that there was no problem prohibiting the\n\nattorneys or their representatives from speak ing abo ut the cas e. State v. Hartman,\n\n703 S.W .2d 10 6, 116 (Tenn . 1985 ).         The tw ist in this c ase, h owe ver, is that\n\nCarruth ers wa s repres enting him self during trial.\n\n\n\n       As we stated earlier, “one of the most fundamental responsibilities of a trial\n\ncourt in a crim inal ca se is to a ssure that a fa ir trial is conducted.” State v. Fran klin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747951\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747951/state-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (Tenn. 1986).            And while prior restraints o n speech are\n\ngene rally suspe ct, see, e.g., State v.

Crim.\n\nApp. 1996), there are instances where the exercise of free speech mus t yield to the\n\nmost fundament of all freedo ms, the right to a fair trial. See The News-Journal Corp.\n\nv. Foxman, 939 F .2d 14 99, 15 12 (11 th Cir. 1 991).          T he righ t to a fair tria l is\n\nguaranteed, not only to the accused, but also to the state as the representative of\n\nthe people. See, e.g., United States v. Ford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495249\"><a href=\"/opinion/495249/united-states-v-harold-e-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (6th Cir. 1987)\n\n(Krupansky, J., concurring). Carruthers cites United State v . Ford, which provides\n\nthat there m ust ex ist a “cle ar and prese nt dan ger” be fore a tr ial cou rt may impose\n\n\n                                             69\n\fa prior restraint on a cr imina l defen dant’s spee ch du ring trial. Other federal circuits,\n\nhowever, apply a lower standard when evaluating restrictive orders imposed upon\n\ncriminal defendants; that is, whether there is a “reasonable likelihood” that a fair trial\n\nwill be lost ab sent the re striction on speec h. See The News-Journal Corp., 939 F.2d\n\nat 1515 n.18.\n\n\n\n       Regardless of which standard is applied in this case , we agre e with the state\n\nthat there was at least a spe cific clea r and p resen t dang er that a n unfa ir trial wo uld\n\noccur if the speech of the defendant was not curtailed. Since this case garnere d\n\nsubstantial med ia atten tion in the Memphis a rea, the trial judg e was rightly\n\nconcerned about the media ’s influence on the po tential jury pool. The trial judge\n\nremarked about the several media interviews given by Carruthers, his investigators,\n\nas well as one of the prosecutors. Furthermore, as demonstrated through the\n\ntestimony of Shaw, Carruthers appa rently threatened Shaw and made arrange ments\n\nthrough one of his investigators to have a news reporter interview Shaw about\n\nrecanting his story. Obviously, if a criminal d efenda nt is allowe d to ma nipulate the\n\nwitnesses and media during trial, the guarantee of a fair trial is nonex istent. Aside\n\nfrom this, as already made evident, the trial judge was also properly concerned\n\nabout the safety of all involved. The order was specifically drawn to curtail the\n\nparticular dangers of an unfair trial in this case. That is, the judge did not want any\n\nattorney, staff member, investigator or pro se litigant to have any exchange with the\n\nmedia. Given the entire record of proceedings in this case, we find no problem with\n\nthe trial court’s ga g order. See Pedini v. Bowles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D.Fla. 1994). Moreover, although\n\nappa rently not considered by the trial judge, we do not believe there were any\n\nreason able altern atives to th e gag o rder. See, e.g., The News-Journal Corp., 939\n\nF.2d at 1513 n.16.\n\n\n\n       Carruthers’ main co mplain t about the gag order is that he may have been\n\nprevented from discovering the presence of an otherwise unknown witness. Again,\n\nthe med ia was given free rein to cov er the p rocee dings at trial. The public was\n\ncertain ly aware of what was going on, and we do not believe an interview by\n\n\n                                             70\n\fCarruthers would have produced different results than were achieved with the\n\nexistent media coverage. Accordingly, even if the gag order was invalid, given the\n\nnature of Car ruther s’ com plaint, it d id not a ffect the fairnes s of the trial.\n\n\n\nSeverance\n\n       Montgo mery claims the trial court erred in denying his motions to sever the\n\ntrial of the tw o defe ndan ts. Spe cifically, h e claim s he w as un duly p rejudic ed in th is\n\njoint trial b ecau se ce rtain statements by Carruthers would not have been admitted\n\nagainst him in a separate trial and because of the manner in which Carruthers\n\nrepresented himself at trial. The state contends the trial court acted properly.\n\n\n\n       The decision wheth er to gran t a motion to sever defendants lies within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless\n\nthe movin g party w as clearly prejudice d. State v. Hutchison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432566\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432566/state-v-hutchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166\n\n(Tenn. 1994).      A motion to sever may be granted before trial if “it is deemed\n\napprop riate to prom ote a fa ir determination of the guilt or innocenc e of one or m ore\n\ndefend ants.” Tenn.R .Crim.P . 14(c)(2)(i). A motion to sever made during trial may\n\nonly be granted when the defend ant to be s evered conse nts and it is necess ary to\n\nachieve a fair determination of guilt. 14 (c)(2)(ii). Befo re a defe ndant is e ntitled to\n\na reversal, the record must show that the “‘defen dant w as clea rly prejudiced to the\n\npoint that the trial court’s discretion ended and the granting of [a] severance became\n\na judicial duty.’” State v. Burton, 751 S.W .2d 440, 447 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1988 ).\n\n\n\n              “It may have been to the interest of each [defendant] that he be\n       tried alone, but the orders of the court are molded to protect rights, and\n       not merely the interests, of persons accused of crime. The state, as\n       well as the persons accused, is entitled to have its rights protected, and\n       when several perso ns are charged jointly with a single crime, we think\n       the state is entitled to have the fact of guilt determined and punishment\n       assessed in a single trial, unless to do so would unfairly prejudice the\n       rights of the defend ants.”\n\n\nState v.

We disagree.     We have\n\nprevio usly discussed the two statements by Jonathan Montgomery to Chris Hines\n\nand found that the first statement was properly admitted under the co-conspirator\n\nexception to the hearsay rule.        The proof at trial clearly connected James\n\nMontgomery to Hines’ car. We also believe, contrary to Montgomery’s insistence,\n\nthat Carruthers’ letters and statements to Jimmy Maze would have properly been\n\nadmitted against M ontgom ery und er this sam e exce ption to the hearsa y rule. W e\n\nprevio usly stated that the trial court properly admitted these letters into evidence\n\nagainst Carruthers. And while the letters do not specifically mention Montgomery,\n\nother evidence introduced at trial clearly connected Montgomery to Carruthers’ plan.\n\nIn fact, while Carruthe rs and Jonathan Montgomery were riding around with Maze\n\nin December 1993, Carruthers mentioned that the y wou ld nee d to wa it until James\n\nwas released from prison before kidnapping Anderson. And although the state must\n\nshow the existence of a conspiracy in o rder to introduce h earsay of a co -conspirator,\n\nthe trial judge may permit independent proof of a conspiracy after the admission of\n\nthe hearsa y eviden ce.

T he evide nce wa s otherw ise sufficien t to sustain the\n\nconvictions of Montgomery.\n\n\n\n      Similarly, Montgomery also insists that Charles Ray Smith could not have\n\noverheard Carruthers and Montgomery discuss the conspiracy when Marcellos\n\nAnderson returned Carruth ers to priso n from fu rlough because the prison records\n\nreflect that Carruthers did not take furlough after Montgomery was transferred to the\n\nMark Luttrell Reception Center. However, the records do reflect that Carruthers,\n\nMontgo mery and Sm ith were all hou sed a t the sa me tim e in the Reception Center\n\n\n                                           72\n\fduring the early part of November 1993. Moreover, Andre “Baby Brother” Johnson\n\ntestified that Smith warned him and Anderson to watch out for Carruthers and\n\nMontgomery. Both Johnson and Terrell Ad air were also pre sent when Montgom ery\n\nand Carruthers mentioned they had so meone already targeted . Also, Montgo mery\n\ntold Adair th at if the p olice d id not h ave a body , there c ould b e no c rime. T his\n\nmatched statements attributed to Carruthers. Accordingly, Montgomery’s complaint\n\nin this re spec t mus t fail.\n\n\n\n         Montgo mery further claims a severance should have been granted because\n\nthe manne r in which Ca rruthers conduc ted his defen se pre judice d Mo ntgom ery’s\n\ncase. Montgomery complains about Carruthers’ mannerisms in front of the jury as\n\nwell as a few of the que stions he asked some witness es. He also suggests that\n\nAlfredo Shaw w ould not have been called to te stify against him in a s eparate trial\n\nand the fact tha t Carruth ers called him to testify u nduly prejudiced his case because\n\nit was “so me of th e mos t dama ging evid ence o f the entire trial.”\n\n\n\n         When two defend ants are on trial toge ther, there will invariably be evidence\n\nadm issible against one that would otherwise not be admissible against the other.\n\nThis factor alone, however, does not preclude the state from going forward in a trial\n\non two or m ore defe ndants . In cases wh ere evidence would be admissible against\n\none defendant but not the other, the trial court may properly instruct the jury that they\n\nare only to co nsider the evidenc e adm issible aga inst each defend ant sep arately. In\n\nthe present case, although certain evide nce, s uch a s Alfred o Sha w’s testimony, may\n\nnot have been admissible against Montgomery, the trial court in this case instructed\n\nthe jury that each appellant was “entitled to have their cases decided on the\n\nevidence and the law which is applicable to them.” The jury is presumed to have\n\nfollowed the cour t’s instruction .

Montgomery claims Shaw’s earlier statement to the\n\npolice was a prior inconsistent statement that should have only been admitted for\n\nimpeachment purposes, not for the truth of the matter asserted.                     No limiting\n\ninstruction was requested or given. The state argues in response that the prior\n\nstatement by Shaw was admissible to help explain to the jury, in light of her\n\ntestimony that she was still afraid for her life, why her trial testimony differed from her\n\nstatement to the police.\n\n\n\n       Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses can only be offered to impeach a\n\nwitness’ credibility, no t for the truth o f the ma tter asserte d.

However, where there is no contemporaneous\n\nrequest for a limiting instruction, the error of the trial court cannot later be attacked\n\non appeal. T.R.A .P. 36(a). Mon tgomery c orrectly asserts, how ever, that the failure\n\nby a trial court to issue a contemporaneous curative instruction for prior inconsistent\n\nstatements, even in the absence of a special request, could, under some\n\ncircumstances, constitute reversible error: \"[when] the impeaching testimony is\n\nextrem ely damag ing, the need for the limiting instruction is appa rent, and the failure\n\nto give it results in sub stantial pre judice to th e rights of th e accu sed.\" Reece, 637\n\nS.W.2d at 861. In Reece, the Suprem e Court also s tated that the review ing court\n\nshou ld consider the overall strength of the state’s case in deciding whether the\n\nfailure to instru ct con stitutes revers ible error. Id. Since Shaw testified on the stand\n\nthat the victims’ hands were not tied when they left her house, there should have\n\nbeen an instruction regarding her prior inconsistent statement to the police.\n\n\n\n       We do not agree with the state’s argument that the prior inconsistent\n\nstatement was properly admitted to explain Shaw’s trial testimony.

This claim is without m erit.\n\n\n\nTestimony of Terrell Adair, Andre Johnson and Chris Hines\n\n      Montgo mery also claims that certain testimony by these three witnesses was\n\nerroneo usly allow ed by the trial court. Th e state dis agrees .\n\n\n\n      The prosecutor asked Adair if he was present during a conversation between\n\nCharles Ray Smith, Marcellos Anderson and Andre Johnson about their personal\n\nsafety. Adair stated he was and then the prosecutor asked Adair what Smith said.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery objected claiming the answ er called fo r hearsa y. After a\n\nbench conference, the trial court sustained the objection but allowed the prosecutor\n\nto ask Adair if the conve rsation too k place. The prosecutor then asked the following\n\nquestion: “Mr. Adair, without telling us what Mr. Smith said, was there a conversation\n\nregarding their personal sa fety between Charles R ay Smith a nd Mr. An dre Johnson\n\nand Marcellos A nderson? ” Montgom ery claims on appeal that this question was an\n\nimprop er use o f a prior con sistent state ment.\n\n\n\n      We find that the appellant has waived this issue, however, we also disagree\n\nwith the app ellant’s claim . Counsel objected to the question at trial because it called\n\nfor hears ay. The trial court sus tained the objection .

Regardless, we do not believe this is a situation where a witness was\n\n\n                                           76\n\fimpro perly questioned about a prior consistent statement. The witness was not\n\ntestifying about a prior statem ent he m ade, rath er he w as testifying about a\n\nconversation that took place between three other individuals. While it may have\n\nbeen h earsay , we do n ot find any other erro r in the testim ony in this re spect.\n\n\n\n      Montgo mery also complains about a portion of Andre Johnson’s testimony.\n\nAt one point, the prosecutor asked Johnson if he had a talk with Anderson about\n\nCarruthers and Montg omery. Johnson responded: “I had a talk to Marcellos and\n\nTerre ll Adair. I told th em, ‘Look, do not ride James and Tony in a car with you\n\nbecause a friend of mine was in jail with them to ld them people --.’” Counsel for\n\nMontgo mery immediately objected and the judge told the witness that he could not\n\nrepeat what so meon e else sa id to him. The prosecutor then asked Johnson what\n\nhe told Adair and Anderson, and Johnson answered: “I told them, ‘Don’t ride James\n\nand Tony in the car with you because they out to rob you and kill you.’” Mon tgomery\n\nnow claim s this was an improper use of a prior statement. For the same reasons we\n\ndiscussed above in relation to Adair’s testimony, we find that the appellant has\n\nwaived this claim.     Nevertheless, we do not believe this constituted a prior\n\nstatem ent. This was the first time Johnson was asked about what he told Anderson\n\nand Adair, therefore, there was no other state ment, either con sistent or inc onsisten t,\n\nbefore the jury.\n\n\n\n      Montgo mery alleges that the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to question\n\nChris Hines about a prio r statement. The appellant claims there was no basis for\n\nthis line of que stioning. H ines wa s ques tioned by the pros ecutor a nd then both\n\nappellan ts cross examined him. During redirect, in an attempt to rehabilitate the\n\nwitness, the prosecutor questioned Hines about a statement he gave to the police.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery objected to this line of questioning stating that it went\n\nbeyond the scope of cross examination.           The trial judge made the following\n\ncomments in overruling the objection:\n\n\n\n              Everything he asked about, though, relates to the subject matter\n       that has been covered in this state ment. Qu estions were asked about\n       the car wa sh, wh o was hed it, h ow it was washed, who cleaned out the\n       trunk, what the circumstances were, what the circumstances were\n\n                                           77\n\f       when he talked to Jonathan, what the circumstances were when he\n       talked to James and Tony, how many phone calls were made, when\n       they were made, how they w ere mad e.

And if he ge ts into areas in this statement that go\n       beyond what was covered on cross, certainly your objection would be\n       sustained. As long as the areas in this statement that he is covering\n       pertain to the areas that you-all covered on cross, I’m going to ove rrule\n       the objection.\n\n\nWe a gree w ith the trial court’s ruling and find no error in this line of questioning by\n\nthe state on redire ct.

This claim,\n\ntherefore , is also with out me rit.\n\n\n\nOpinion Testimony\n\n       Montgo mery claim s that C hris H ines sh ould n ot hav e bee n allow ed to g ive his\n\nopinio n of wh at Mo ntgom ery m eant w hen h e told Hines that a rifle had blood on it.\n\nMontgo mery cites Tenn. R. Evid. 701, which provides that a lay witness’s “testimony\n\nin the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which\n\nare (1) rationally based upon the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear\n\nunderstanding of the witness’s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” He\n\nargues that H ines’ int erpre tation had no fou ndatio n of fac t and w as no t rationa lly\n\nbased on his pe rception. In response, the state contends that Hines was not being\n\nasked to give his opinion as to w hat M ontgo mery mea nt, but to expla in why Hines\n\nrefused to accep t the wea pon.\n\n\n\n       At the trial, the state asked Hines w hat hav ing blood on the w eapon mean t to\n\nhim, and he responded tha t it mea nt that s ome body had b een s hot w ith it. At this\n\npoint, Montg omery objected “as far as w hat it mea nt to” Hine s, but the trial court\n\noverrule d the ob jection.\n\n\n\n       To the extent that the testimony was presented to show Hines’ interpretation\n\nfor the purpose of explaining Hines’ rejection of the weapon, we believe the evidence\n\nwas inadm issible bec ause it w as who lly irrelevant to the issue s on trial. See Tenn.\n\nR. Evid. 401, 402. To the extent that the testimony could be taken as evidence of\n\nwhat Montgomery meant by saying that the weapon “had blood on it,” we believe\n\n                                            78\n\fthat the record provides insufficient foundation to justify the admission of Hines’\n\ninterpretation. If a phrase is not common parlance and carries a particular meaning\n\nin a partic ular context or environment, the witness to such meaning should lay a\n\nfoundation that show s that the w itness ha s the spe cialized kn owledg e need ed to\n\nassist the jury su bstantially to understand the evidence. Tenn. R. Evid. 702. Such\n\nwas not done in this case.\n\n\n\n       Howe ver, we conclude that any error was harmless. We do not believe that\n\nthe jury was at undue risk because of Hines’ opinion, given the fact that they already\n\nknew that Montgomery said that the weapon had blood on it. Such is also true in the\n\ncontext of all of th e rem aining evide nce in this case . The de fendan t does no t specify\n\nany particu lar preju dice th at mo re prob ably than not affected the verdict and we find\n\nnone in our review of the record.\n\n\n\nJury Instructions\n\n       Montgo mery claims the trial court’s jury instruction on the especially heinous,\n\natrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance was improper. He claims that the use\n\nof the phrase “in that” instead of “and” - the murder is especially heinous, atrocious\n\nor cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse - sugg ested to the jury\n\nthat all acts of torture or serious physical abuse are automatically classified as\n\nheinous, atrocious or crue l. This very argument has recently been rejected by our\n\nSupreme Court.        See State v. Nesbit, 978 S.W .2d 872, 887 (Tenn. 199 8).\n\nAcco rdingly , this claim mus t fail.\n\n\n\n       Montgo mery also claims that the trial court improp erly instructed the jury\n\nregarding mitigating evidence.          Specifically, he claims the trial court erred by\n\ninstructing the jury that it should not distinguish between statutory and any requested\n\nnon-statutory mitigating circumstances and by instructing the jury on sta tutory\n\nmitigating circumstances that were not supported by the record. The trial judge\n\ninstructed the jury on mitigating evidenc e acco rding to the statute in existence at the\n\ntime. T.C.A. § 39-13-203(e) (1991). The appellant seems to suggest that the “no\n\ndistinction” aspect of the instruction prejudiced him because he did not request an\n\n\n\n                                              79\n\finstruction on any non-sta tutory circumsta nce. How ever, since there were no non-\n\nstatutory circumstances requested, the jury did not have anything to distinguish.\n\nAccord ingly, we do not be lieve the a ppellant w as prejud iced by th is instruction .\n\n\n\n       Montgo mery further claims that the judge erred in instructing the jury on all of\n\nthe statutory mitigating circumstances even though they were not all supported by\n\nthe record.    According to the appellant’s argument, this undermined his actual\n\nmitigation and emphasized to the jury the number of circumstances missing from the\n\ncase. The Supreme Court has recognized that only those mitigating circumstances\n\nraised by the ev idence should b e instructe d. See State v. Cazes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n267 (Tenn. 1993). The Court has also held, however, that any such error in th is\n\nrespect does not require reversal unless the appellant can show prejudice. Id. The\n\nappellant claims, d espite the Supre me C ourt’s ruling on this issue, that instructing\n\non all of the circumstances does not benefit him. Again, absent a showing of\n\nprejudice, this claim m ust fail. See State v.

Carruthers also claims that the recent amendment to T.C.A. § 40-\n\n23-114 (1998 Supp.), which allows those capital case defendants who committed\n\ntheir offense prior to January 1, 1999, to elect to be put to death by lethal injection\n\nconstitutes an uncon stitutional de legation o f legislative a uthority. W e disagree. The\n\nstatute clearly states that this class of offenders shall be put to death by\n\nelectrocution. The s tatute, h owe ver, giv es the offend er the o ption to waive this\n\nmethod of exe cution and e lect leth al inject ion ins tead. T his is not a delegation of the\n\nlegisla ture’s autho rity. This claim is without m erit. At any rate, this statute does not\n\naffect the appellants’ convictions or sentences.\n\n\n\nProportionality Review\n\n       Pursuant to T.C.A. § 39-13-206, this Court must consider whether the\n\nsentence of death was im pose d in an arbitrar y fash ion an d whe ther the sente nce is\n\nexcessive or dispropo rtionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Interestingly,\n\nneither appellant has addressed the proportionality review in their appellate briefs.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently issued the following mandate in order to assist the\n\nappellate courts in fulfilling their statutory duties:\n\n\n       the State and the defendant in each case must fully brief the issue by\n       spec ifically identifying those similar cases relevant to the comparative\n       proportio nality inquiry. W hen ad dressing proportio nality review , the\n       briefs of the p arties s hall conta in a section setting forth the nature and\n       circumstances of the crimes that are claimed to be similar to that of\n       which the defenda nt has been convicted, including the statutory\n       aggravating circumstances found by the jury and the evidence of\n       mitigating circumstances . In addition, the parties shall include in the\n       section a discussion of the character and record of the defendants\n       involved in the crim es, to the e xtent asce rtainable from the Rule 12\n       reports, appellate cou rt decisions, or records of the trial and sentencing\n       hearings in those cases.\n\n\nState v. Bland, 958 S.W .2d 651, 667 (Tenn. 199 7) (emphasis added) (internal\n\nfootnotes omitted). The Bland opinion was issued we ll before the appe llate record\n\nwas filed in this case.\n\n\n\n       In Bland, the Su prem e Cou rt outlined the proce ss ap pellate courts shou ld\n\nemploy when conducting a comparative proportionality review. The review required\n\nis not a rigid, objective test, id. at 668 , nor are the co urts bo und to cons ider on ly\n\nthose case s in wh ich exa ctly the same aggravating circumstances have been found,\n\n                                             83\n\fState v. Brimmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455830\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455830/state-v-brimmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (Te nn. 199 4). It is the duty of the app ellate\n\ncourt, not to “assure that a sentence less than death was neve r impo sed in a case\n\nwith similar character istics,” b ut to “as sure th at no a berra nt dea th sen tence is\n\naffirmed .” Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 665. With respect to the circumstances of the\n\noffense, we con sider: 1) the mean s of death ; 2) the manner of death; 3) the\n\nmotivation for the killing; 4) the place of death; 5) the simila rity of the victims’\n\ncircumstances including age, physical and mental conditions, and the victims’\n\ntreatment during the killing; 6) the absence or presence of premeditation; 7) the\n\nabsence or presence of provocation; 8) the absence or presence of justification; and\n\n9) the injury to a nd effects on non deced ent victim s. With re spect to comparing the\n\ncharacter of the de fenda nts, the followin g facto rs are re levan t: 1) the d efend ant’s\n\nprior criminal record or prior criminal activity; 2) the defendant’s age, race, and\n\ngender; 3) the defendant’s mental, emotional or physical condition; 4) the\n\ndefendant’s involvement or role in the murder; 5) the defen dant’s co operatio n with\n\nauthorities; 6) the defendant’s remorse; 7) the defendant’s knowledge of\n\nhelplessness of victim(s); and 8) the defendant’s capacity for rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n       The facts and circumstances o f the offe nses in this ca se ha ve be en tho rough ly\n\ndetailed above.    The three victims were kidnapped and ultimately buried alive.\n\nBefore being placed in the ground, two of the victims were shot and one was beaten\n\nwith a shovel. The appellants knew their victims: Marcellos Anderson, twenty-five\n\nyears of age; his mother, Delois Anderson, in her forties; and F rederick Tuc ker,\n\nseventeen years old. The appellants w ere both twenty-six years of age at the time\n\nof the mu rders. Bo th appe llants claim they are innocen t of the crim es. As the\n\npresentence reports indicate, both appellants have extensive prior criminal records,\n\nincluding crimes of violence to the person.\n\n\n\n       While no two cas es are th e sam e, the follow ing case s wher e the de ath\n\nsentence was imposed contain similar characteristics to the present one: In State\n\nv. Zagorski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436937\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436937/state-v-zagorski/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn . 1985 ), the tw enty-e ight ye ar old defendant shot\n\nand slit the throats of the two victims and left them to die in the woods during an\n\n\n\n\n                                            84\n\falleged ly botched drug deal. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: the\n\nmurder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the murder was committed\n\nduring the course of a robbery. In State v.

The victims were shot and stabbed in their\n\nhome. There was also evide nce th at the d efend ant ha d prev iously threatened the\n\nvictims. The defendant presented an alibi defense at trial. The jury found four\n\naggravating circumstances for two of the victims (the murder was especially heinous,\n\natrocious or cruel; the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding arrest or\n\nprosecution; the murder was committed during the commission of a felony; the\n\ndefendant committed mass murder) and two for the third victim (the murder was\n\nespe cially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the defendant committed mass m urder).\n\nIn State v. Burns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416587/state-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1998), the young defendant was convicted\n\nof felony murder and sentenced to death. The defendant and his accomplices\n\napproached four young m en sitting in a car, robbed th em, a nd killed two of them.\n\nThe jury found one aggravator, that the defendant created a risk of ha rm to two or\n\nmore persons. In State v. Mo rris, No. 02C01-980 1-CC -00012 (Tenn. C rim. App .,\n\nFeb. 5, 1999) (appeal to Supreme Court pending), the thirty-eight year old defendant\n\nwas convicte d on two counts of premeditated first degree murder and senten ced to\n\ndeath. The defendant intended to rob his neighbors for drug money. The two\n\nvictims were the male neighbor and his minor cousin-in-law. The defendant also\n\nkidnapped and raped the wife of the male victim. The jury found two aggravating\n\ncircumstances: the murde r was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and the\n\nmurder was committed during the course of a first degree murder, rape, burglary or\n\nkidnapping. We are convinced that the result in the case before us was neither\n\ndisproportionate nor arbitrary.\n\n\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we affirm the appellants’\n\nconvictions and sentences. Because this case will automatically be reviewed by the\n\nSupreme Court, w e will not se t a date of e xecution . See T.C.A. § 39-13-20 6(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                         85\n\f                         ____________________________________\n                         THOMAS T.
