After OIR\ncompleted its review, real parties in interest and interveners the Los Angeles Times\n(Times), and real parties in interest and interveners, Anya Slaughter, Kris Ockershauser,\nthe Pasadena Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople, ACT, the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of the Greater Pasadena\n(collectively, the Slaughter parties or, when mentioned in conjunction with the Times,\nInterveners), made requests under the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code,1 § 6250\net seq.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)) (PRA or the Act) seeking disclosure of the\nOIR’s August 2014 “Report to the City of Pasadena Concerning the Officer-Involved\nShooting of . . . McDade” (Report).\n       Petitioners the Pasadena Police Officers Association (PPOA) and Pasadena Police\nOfficers Matthew Griffin and Jeffrey Newlen (the officers or, in conjunction with the\nPPOA, collectively, petitioners) initiated this reverse PRA action, seeking to enjoin\ndisclosure of the Report. After initially issuing a temporary restraining order, the trial\ncourt eventually permitted the Times and Slaughter parties to intervene, denied the\ninjunction, and ordered the Report publically released. However, the trial court found\n\n\n       1All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n                                              2\n\fcertain portions of the Report constituted confidential peace officer personnel records,\nexempt from disclosure pursuant to section 6254, subdivision (k), and ordered those\nportions redacted. The court stayed the effect of its judgment to permit parties to seek\nextraordinary writ relief. (§ 6259, subd. (c).)\n       We deny the petition by which PPOA and the officers seek to preclude disclosure\nof the entire Report or, in the alternative, the production of a more heavily redacted\nReport. The trial court correctly concluded that the Report itself is a public document.\nThe court also correctly determined that portions of the Report contain confidential\npersonnel information exempt from disclosure under the PRA. The trial court’s\nredactions, however, went too far. Our review of the sealed materials in the record\nreveals that some of the material the court ordered redacted from the Report is unrelated\nto personnel files of individual officers. The inappropriately redacted material includes\nanalyses of the PPD’s administrative investigation and departmental policies, descriptions\nof the PPD’s responsiveness (or the absence thereof), and recommendations by the OIR,\nnone of which is privileged under the PRA. 2 Accordingly, we deny the petition and\nremand the matter to the superior court with directions to conduct new proceedings, and\nissue a new or modified judgment ordering appropriate redactions to the Report in\naccordance with this opinion.\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On March 24, 2012, just after 11:00 p.m., the officers responded to a 911 call.\nThe caller claimed to have been robbed at gunpoint by two men. Much later, the caller\nadmitted he had falsely reported that the robbers were armed.\n       Responding to the dispatch broadcast, the officers proceeded in their squad car to\nthe area of the alleged crime. As they approached the intersection, McDade, a 19-year-\n\n       2 As discussed in section 6 below, the material we deem inappropriately redacted\nwas filed under seal. It is contained in appendix A to this opinion, also filed under seal\nand not referred to in the published portion of this opinion. Appendix A will remain\nsealed until the superior court issues a new judgment (see below).\n\n                                              3\n\fold African-American male, began running. The officers pursued McDade about two\nblocks. Officer Griffin fired four shots at McDade from inside the patrol car. Officer\nNewlen, having previously exited the squad car to give chase, fired four more shots,\nkilling McDade. It was later discovered that McDade was not armed.\n       The shooting spawned multiple investigations, a citizen’s complaint (filed on\nMarch 25, 2012), and a federal lawsuit by McDade’s mother, Anya Slaughter, against the\nofficers and the City. The Los Angeles District Attorney conducted a criminal\ninvestigation which concluded with a finding that, due to the false report, the officers\nreasonably had believed McDade was armed. No criminal charges were filed against the\nofficers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a civil rights investigation of the\nshooting, which ultimately was closed without the filing of criminal charges or a civil\ncomplaint. Slaughter’s federal action against the City and the officers was settled.\n       The PPD conducted its own investigations. Two were conducted immediately\nafter the McDade shooting. The purpose of the first investigation, undertaken by the\nPPD’s Criminal Investigations Division (CID), was to determine whether the officers\ncommitted a crime. Different PPD investigators conducted a separate Internal Affairs\n(IA) investigation. The PPD investigated the March 25, 2012 citizen complaint in the\ncourse of its CID and IA investigations. In March 2013, the PPD conducted a third\ninvestigation: an administrative review based on evidence collected during the CID and\nIA investigations. That administrative review concluded with a determination that the\nofficers acted within departmental policy because they reasonably had believed McDade\nwas armed and assaulting an officer, and shot him in self-defense and in defense of one\nanother.\n       The officers were interrogated and gave voluntary statements to investigators in\nthe course of the CID investigation. Those statements were considered as part of the\ndistrict attorney’s analysis in determining whether to file criminal charges. The officers\nwere deposed in Slaughter’s federal civil rights action against them. At their depositions\nthe officers were questioned about the shooting and the subsequent investigations, and\n\n                                             4\n\feach used the statement he had given during the CID investigation to refresh his\nrecollection.3 The officers did not provide additional statements in connection with\neither the IA investigation or the PPD’s administrative review.\n       On an unspecified date soon after the shooting in March 2012 the City retained\nOIR as a private consultant to conduct an independent review of the McDade shooting.\nAccording to the declaration submitted in this action by PPD Deputy Chief Darryl Qualls,\n“[t]he purpose of the OIR Group’s review, memorialized in the OIR Report, was to serve\nas a review of the incident for the benefit of the department and to evaluate how the\n[PPD] does business in the areas reviewed.” Deputy Chief Qualls also declared that the\nPPD would not use OIR’s Report “to (1) affect the officers’ advancement; (2) conduct an\nappraisal of the officers; or (3) consider discipline of the officers.” After reviewing the\nReport and other evidence, the trial court found the City retained OIR in order to evaluate\nthe thoroughness and objectivity of the PPD’s investigations of the McDade shooting, the\nadequacy of officer training, what lessons had been learned from the incident and, based\non OIR’s review and conclusions, to recommend institutional reforms.\n       OIR’s 70-page Report was completed in August 2014. Interveners submitted\nrequests to the City for the Report on the McDade shooting, pursuant to the PRA. On\nSeptember 3, 2014, while the PRA requests remained pending, PPOA and the officers\ninitiated the underlying reverse PRA action, and sought and obtained a temporary\nrestraining order (TRO) preventing release of the Report. On September 9, 2014, the trial\ncourt vacated the TRO on the ground the matter was not yet ripe, and ordered the City to\nrespond to the Interveners’ PRA requests and to give petitioners notice if it intended to\ndisclose the Report. Interveners submitted new or renewed PRA requests for the Report\nto the City on September 9, 2014.\n\n\n       3 Transcripts of the officers’ depositions have been publicly available since\nJanuary 2014. Their statements from the CID investigation were not attached as exhibits\nto those transcripts.\n\n                                              5\n\f       On September 11, 2014, the City announced that unless the court directed\notherwise, it planned to release a redacted copy of the Report the following week. The\nCity stated it intended to redact portions of the Report containing confidential police\nofficer personnel records. 4\n       On September 16, 2014, petitioners filed an ex parte application seeking to enjoin\nthe City from releasing any portion of the Report. The same day, the Times and others\nfiled motions seeking to intervene in this action and writ petitions seeking to compel\nrelease of the Report without redactions. The trial court granted leave to intervene.\n       On October 16, 2014, after extensive briefing and oral argument, the trial court\nissued a 16-page “Decision on Application for Injunctive Relief-Partly Granted.” The\ncourt acknowledged the parties’ competing positions regarding disclosure of the Report:\nConsistent with their positions here, Interveners argued the Report is a public record and\nshould be disclosed in its entirety. Petitioners asserted that the Report is a confidential\npersonnel record entirely exempt from disclosure under the Pitchess5 statutes (Pen. Code,\n§§ 832.5, 832.7, 832.8) and the privilege exemption of the PRA (Gov. Code, § 6254,\nsubd. (k).) The City argued that all but about 20 percent of the Report (which it agreed\nwas confidential personnel information) should be disclosed.\n       The trial court found the Report was indisputably a “public record,” in which the\n“public’s interest in disclosure . . . is ‘particularly great’ because it relates to ‘officer\ninvolved shootings’ and governmental policies regarding law enforcement and public\nsafety.” The court also found that specific portions of the Report constituted confidential\npersonnel records, exempt from disclosure under section 6254, subdivision (k).\n       Before the trial court, Interveners argued the officers had waived any arguable\nprivilege or exemption from disclosure of the Report by placing much of the information\n\n\n       4The City chose to waive its right to assert an additional PRA exemption from\ndisclosure for law enforcement investigatory files. (§ 6254, subd. (f).)\n       5   Pitchess v. Superior Court (1974) 11 Cal.3d 531.\n\n                                                6\n\fthey sought to suppress in the public domain in the course of Slaughter’s federal court\naction, during which portions of the officers’ deposition transcripts had been filed in\nconnection with a summary judgment motion. No protective order was sought and those\ntranscripts were not filed under seal. At his deposition, each officer had testified about\nthe circumstances surrounding the McDade shooting, including his own actions, tactics\nand concerns. The officers also used the statements they made to detectives during the\nCID investigation to refresh their recollections. The court rejected Interveners’ assertion\nof waiver. It concluded that, although “the Officers may have waived any confidentiality\nassociated with the information or communications in the public domain,” information\ncontained in or derived from their personnel files retained its confidential status\nregardless of whether it was also available elsewhere in an unprotected document.\n       Interveners also argued that the officers and the City waived confidentiality and\nprivilege exemptions once the City disclosed the Report to petitioners. In other words,\nhaving disclosed the Report to members of the public (i.e., the officers), the City was\nrequired to make the Report available for public inspection. The court also rejected this\ncontention. It observed that police officers have a statutory right to inspect their\npersonnel files. (§ 3306.5.) The privilege of confidentiality in officers’ personnel\nrecords belongs to the officers as well as to the City. The officers had a right to review\nthe Report in order to determine whether to assert confidentiality as to some or all of it.\n       In conclusion, the trial court found that those portions of the Report that “‘recite[]\nor rel[y] upon the administrative investigation’” are exempt from disclosure under the\nPitchess statutes. It found the administrative and criminal investigations were clearly\nseparate investigations. The latter investigation did not constitute a personnel record and\ndid “not reveal any information about the ‘advancement, appraisal, or discipline’ of a\nparticular officer. See Penal Code [section] 832.8[, subdivision] (d).” (Italics omitted.)\nHowever, an administrative investigation that “results in a disciplinary recommendation\nto the Chief of Police, and the administrative process [are] protected by the Pitchess\nstatutes.” The court concluded that those portions of the Report containing privileged\n\n                                              7\n\fpersonnel information generated in connection with the PPD’s internal administrative\ninvestigation qualified for protection and must be redacted.\n       On November 13, 2014, after reviewing the City’s and petitioners’ proposed\nredactions to the Report, the trial court entered judgment and ordered release of the\nredacted Report. The trial court vacated its September 16, 2014 TRO, but stayed the\neffect of its vacation order and judgment for 20 days to permit the parties to seek review\nof the judgment.\n       On November 26, 2014, petitioners filed the instant petition for writ of mandate\nwith this court, seeking review of the trial court’s disclosure order. No other party filed a\npetition. We stayed the trial court’s order pending our decision, and requested briefing.\n(§ 6259, subd. (c).)\nSubsequent events at the Court of Appeal\n       1.     Petitioners’ publicly filed reply brief containing redacted material is\nsealed, then reinstated\n       On March 16, 2015, petitioners filed a “Reply to Preliminary Opposition to [the\nTimes’] Petition for Writ of Mandate and Opposition to Petition for Writ of Mandate”\n(Reply brief). 6 On March 25, 2015, petitioners notified this court that the Reply brief\nfiled on March 16 “inadvertently, and mistakenly, included verbatim excerpts of the\nOIR[] Report,” which are the subject of this proceeding and among the materials\npetitioners maintain are confidential peace officer personnel records. Petitioners asked\nthis court to seal their March 16, 2015 Reply brief, requested permission to substitute an\naccompanying redacted reply brief (omitting the Report’s excerpts) in the public record,\nand requested an order requiring the parties to return the March 16 Reply brief. On\nMarch 25, 2015, we granted petitioners’ request.\n\n\n\n\n       6 The Reply brief also responded to the City’s January 5, 2015, opposition to the\npetition for writ of mandate.\n\n                                              8\n\f       Interveners reacted immediately, requesting that we vacate our March 25 order.\nThey argued that, in the guise of a perfunctory administrative request to remedy a filing\nmistake, petitioners’ March 25 motion actually sought an unconstitutional prior restraint\non speech and sealing order. 7 Interveners noted that they and numerous third parties\nlawfully received the unredacted Reply brief (which was publicly available for nine days\nbefore the motion to seal was filed). Accordingly, they argued that any order punishing\nor preventing dissemination of information in the March 16 Reply brief was a\npresumptively unconstitutional First Amendment violation, as to which petitioners could\nnot satisfy the stringent burden necessary to justify retroactive secreting of the Reply\nbrief. On March 27, 2015, Interveners notified this court of their discovery (after filing\ntheir March 26 opposition to the motion to seal) that much of the information from\npetitioners’ publically available Reply brief had been disseminated in an article published\non March 25, 2015 by the Pasadena Star News, a nonparty media group.\n       In response, petitioners argued they were not required to provide advance notice or\nan opportunity to respond in connection with their motion to seal, that this court’s\nMarch 25 order was not an unconstitutional prior restraint, and that Interveners had\nunlawfully released the sealed reply brief after we issued our March 25 order. 8\n       On April 1, 2015, this court notified the parties that it was considering vacating its\nMarch 25, 2015 order sealing petitioners’ March 16 Reply brief, and gave the parties an\n\n       7 Interveners also claimed they were deprived of notice of and an opportunity to be\nheard as to the motion to seal. The record indicates that petitioners served the motion to\nseal on all parties on March 24, 2015. But Interveners argued that petitioners effected\nservice by mail in a “transparent”––and successful––attempt to ensure Interveners would\nnot learn of the motion until after this court issued an order.\n       8  In a declaration by Michelle White (who is neither a party to this action herself,\nnor affiliated with any party), filed on March 30, 2015, Interveners denied that the Times\nsupplied the unredacted Reply brief to the Star News, or supplied the information to any\nmedia group after we issued the March 25, 2015 order. White declared that she received\nthe unredacted Reply brief on March 19 from counsel for the Slaughter parties, and\nprovided information from that brief to nonparty media outlets before March 25, 2015.\n\n                                              9\n\fopportunity to respond. They did so and, on April 17, 2015, we vacated our March 25\norder, and unsealed and reinstated petitioners’ March 16, 2015 Reply brief in its entirety.\n       2.     The Slaughter parties move to dismiss this proceeding\n       On April 20, 2015, the Slaughter parties filed a motion to dismiss writ proceeding\nand to remand to trial court with instructions (motion to dismiss). They argued that\nbecause petitioners’ counsel publically filed the Reply brief containing a significant\nportion of the material petitioners seek here to suppress without contemporaneously\nasserting privilege on behalf of the officers, petitioners waived any privilege that may\nhave attached with respect to the Report. In short, they asserted that this writ proceeding\nhad been rendered moot. The Slaughter parties also argued that, in addition to dismissing\nthe petition, this court should remand the matter with instructions to the trial court to\nissue an order to show cause to determine whether the entire unredacted Report should be\nreleased to Interveners.\n       Petitioners and the City each opposed the motion to dismiss. The City took no\nposition with respect to a straightforward dismissal of this action. However, because the\nSlaughter parties chose not to file a writ petition seeking affirmative relief pursuant to\nsection 6259, subdivision (c),9 both the City and petitioners opposed the motion to the\nextent the Slaughter parties requested that dismissal be accompanied by an order\ndirecting the trial court to conduct additional proceedings. 10 Petitioners also argued that\nthe motion to dismiss must be denied because there was no basis for this court to\nconclude the matter was moot. 11\n\n\n       9 See MinCal Consumer Law Group v. Carlsbad Police Dept. (2013) 214\nCal.App.4th 259, 263–264 [section 6259, subdivision (c) is the “sole and exclusive means\nto challenge” PRA ruling].\n       10We grant petitioners’ request to consider their untimely opposition to the\nSlaughter parties’ motion to dismiss.\n       11For reasons discussed in sections 5 and 6 below, we conclude the matter is not\nmoot, and deny the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                              10\n\f       3.      The court invites briefing\n       As noted above, no Intervener filed a petition seeking issuance of an extraordinary\nwrit following the trial court’s November 13, 2014 judgment. Nevertheless, collectively,\nInterveners seek affirmative relief in this action. They urge this court to find that, under\nthe guise of protecting statutorily privileged personnel information, the trial court’s ruling\nerroneously shields from disclosure information which must be publically released,\nspecifically criticisms in the Report of the PPD’s administrative review. On April 22,\n2015, we invited the parties to submit letter briefs addressing the issue of “[w]hat, if any,\nauthority . . . this Court [has] to consider/grant relief sought by Interveners?” The parties\nresponded, submitting initial and responsive letter briefs.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       Petitioners maintain the trial court’s order must be reversed. They contend that the\nentire Report is privileged because it “is, in effect, a personnel file, or at the very least,\nsubstantial parts of the [Report] which the Court below refused to redact are clearly\npersonnel material in nature and type,” as described in Penal Code sections 832.5 and\n832.6, and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.\n       The Slaughter parties argue that the public has a strong interest in the Report’s\ncriticisms of the PPD’s handling and administrative investigation of the McDade\nincident, particularly as to lessons it contains to prevent similar incidents. They also\nmaintain that, to the extent the order redacting certain material in the Report is legally\ndefensible, the court was overly protective of the officers’ privacy and improperly treated\npublicly available material (the officers’ testimony in the federal court action) and\ncriticisms of the PPD’s administrative investigation as confidential personnel\ninformation. The Slaughter parties also contend that petitioners waived their right to\nassert privilege by virtue of petitioners’ counsel’s disclosure of excerpts of the Report in\nthe March 16 Reply brief filed in this proceeding.\n       The City contends the trial court got it right, and the petition must be denied.\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f       The Times insists that the petition be denied and the Report disclosed in its\nentirety. They assert that the Pitchess statutes protect only enumerated categories of\nconfidential material not at issue here, and that petitioners’ asserted secrecy interests do\nnot clearly outweigh the significant public interest in full disclosure. The Times also\nargues that, because information used by OIR to prepare its Report was voluntarily and\npublicly disclosed, any right the City or officers may have had to assert confidentiality as\nto that information was waived.\n       We conclude that, in large measure, the trial court’s well-reasoned decision is\ncorrect. The Report is a public document that contains some privileged personnel\ninformation statutorily exempt from disclosure, and no privileges have been waived.\nHowever, we also find that the trial court’s redactions go too far to the extent they\nprevent disclosure of OIR analyses of the PPD’s administrative review and investigation,\nwhich are not criticisms or appraisals directed at officer conduct.\n1.     The PRA\n       The Legislature enacted the PRA in 1968 to clarify the scope of the public’s right\nto inspect records. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 819,\n825.) The PRA was intended to increase freedom of information by giving members of\nthe public access to information in the possession of public agencies. (Long Beach\nPolice Officers Assn. v. City of Long Beach (2014) 59 Cal.4th 59, 66–67 (LBPOA); Los\nAngeles Unified School District v. Superior Court (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 222, 237\n(LAUSD); § 6253, subd. (a).) The Act is premised on the principle that “access to\ninformation concerning the conduct of the people’s business is a fundamental and\nnecessary right of every person in the state.” (§ 6250; CBS, Inc. v. Block (1986) 42\nCal.3d 646, 651, fn. 5.) In furtherance of this goal, the Supreme Court has declared that\n“[m]aximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations” is necessary. (CBS,\nInc. v. Block, at pp. 651–652.) As the result of a voter initiative passed in 2004, the\nPRA’s principles are now enshrined in the state Constitution: “The people have the right\nof access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business, and,\n\n                                             12\n\ftherefore, . . . the writings of public . . . agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.”12\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1); International Federation of Professional &\nTechnical Engineers, Local 21, AFL–CIO v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 329.)\nThe PRA embodies a strong policy in favor of access and must be construed broadly.\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2); County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2012) 211\nCal.App.4th 57, 63 (County of Los Angeles).)\n       Public policy favors disclosure and, generally speaking, a public record is subject\nto disclosure unless the PRA provides otherwise. (County of Santa Clara v. Superior\nCourt (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1320; see Williams v. Superior Court (1993) 5\nCal.4th 337, 346 [“all public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has\nexpressly provided to the contrary”].) The California Supreme Court has found this\npolicy especially salient when the subject is law enforcement: “‘In order to maintain trust\nin its police department, the public must be kept fully informed of the activities of its\npeace officers.’” (Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court\n(2007) 42 Cal.4th 278, 297 (CPOST); see LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 74.) Given the\nextraordinary authority with which they are entrusted, the need for transparency,\naccountability and public access to information is particularly acute when the information\nsought involves the conduct of police officers. In CPOST, the Supreme Court observed,\n“The public’s legitimate interest in the identity and activities of police officers is even\ngreater than its interest in those of the average public servant. ‘Law enforcement officers\ncarry upon their shoulders the cloak of authority to enforce the laws of the state. In order\nto maintain trust in its police department, the public must be kept fully informed of the\nactivities of its peace officers.’ [Citation.] ‘It is indisputable that law enforcement is a\nprimary function of local government and that the public has a far greater interest in the\nqualifications and conduct of law enforcement officers, even at, and perhaps especially\nat, an “on the street” level than in the qualifications and conduct of other comparably\n\n       12   The Report was written for and on behalf of the City, a public agency.\n\n                                               13\n\flow-ranking government employees performing more proprietary functions. The abuse\nof a patrolman’s office can have great potential for social harm . . . .’” (CPOST, at\npp. 297–298; see LBPOA, at p. 74 [observing that the public’s interest in and need for\naccess to information regarding law enforcement is particularly acute in the context of\npolice officers’ use of deadly force].)\n2.     The standard of review\n       The trial court’s construction and “interpretation of the PRA and its application to\nundisputed facts present questions of law subject to de novo . . . review.” CBS\nBroadcasting Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 892, 906; County of Los\nAngeles, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at p. 62.) We apply the substantial evidence test to the\ncourt’s express or implied factual determinations. (County of Los Angeles, at p. 62;\nMichaelis, Montanari & Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1065, 1072.)\n3.     The PRA favors public disclosure except where privacy rights outweigh the\npublic’s interest in disclosure\n       a.      Exceptions to disclosure\n       The right to obtain public records is not absolute. (Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1272, 1282 (Copley Press).) Under the PRA the public has a\nright to inspect public records unless an exception applies. (§ 6253, subds. (a), (b).) In\nadopting the PRA, the Legislature remained “mindful of the right of individuals to\nprivacy” (§ 6250), and enumerated several exceptions to disclosure designed to protect\nindividual privacy rights that outweigh the public’s interest in disclosure. (§ 6254; see\nLAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 238–239.) The California Constitution\nacknowledges that police officers are entitled to certain privacy protections. Article I,\nsection 3, subdivision (b)(3) provides that nothing in that subdivision “‘supersedes or\nmodifies the right of privacy guaranteed by [article 1,] Section 1 or affects the\nconstruction of any statute . . . to the extent that it protects that right to privacy, including\nany statutory procedures governing discovery or disclosure of information concerning the\nofficial performance or professional qualifications of a peace officer.’” (CPOST, supra,\n\n                                               14\n\f42 Cal.4th at p. 288.) The Constitution thus “excludes from the requirement of narrow\nconstruction those statutes . . . protect[ing] the privacy interests of peace officers,\nincluding [the PRA] and the Pitchess statutes . . . at issue here. (LBPOA, supra, 59\nCal.4th at p. 68; see County of Los Angeles, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at p. 60; Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2).) A party opposing disclosure must show the requested\ninformation falls within the parameters of a specific exemption. (LBPOA, at p. 67;\nCPOST, at p. 299; County of Los Angeles, at p. 63; § 6255, subd. (a) [“The agency shall\njustify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt\nunder express provisions of this chapter”].)\n         We are concerned here with one exception to the PRA. That exception protects\nfrom disclosure “[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to\nfederal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code\nrelating to privilege.” (§ 6254, subd. (k).) This provision incorporates the Pitchess\nprotections that render personnel records of peace officers confidential. (Pen. Code,\n§ 832.7, subd. (a); City of Richmond v. Superior Court (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1430,\n1440.)\n         b.     Pitchess protections\n         The law governing protection for the privacy of police officers in California is\nfound in a series of statutes commonly referred to as “Pitchess statutes,” specifically\nPenal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8 and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.\n(Warrick v. Superior Court (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1011, 1019.) In enacting the Pitchess\nstatutes, the Legislature made policy choices, deciding which information should be\npublic and which information should be exempt from disclosure, and “drew the line\ncarefully, with due concern for the competing interests.” (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 298.) The Pitchess statutes provide for two categories of confidential records:\n(1) “personnel records,” and (2) records of citizen complaints about individual officers,\nand reports or findings relating to investigation of such complaints. (LBPOA, supra, 59\nCal.4th at pp. 68–69; Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (a).)\n\n                                               15\n\f         As employed in the Pitchess statutes, the term “personnel records” refers to any\nfile maintained under an individual’s name by his or her employing agency and\ncontaining records related to “[e]mployee advancement, appraisal, or discipline,”\n“[c]omplaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in\nwhich he or she participated, or which he or she perceived, and pertaining to the manner\nin which he or she performed his or her duties,” and “[a]ny other information the\ndisclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n(Pen. Code, § 832.8, subds. (d)–(f).) The disclosure of peace officer personnel records is\nlimited by Penal Code section 832.7, which provides that such records (or information\nobtained from such records), are confidential and may be disclosed in litigation only\nunder specified procedures on a showing of good cause. (See Evid. Code, §§ 1043,\n1045.)\n         Also protected as confidential are an ageny’s investigations of citizen complaints.\n“Under the Pitchess statutes, a public entity that employs peace officers must investigate\nand retain citizen complaints of officer misconduct, such as the use of excessive force.\n(Pen. Code, § 832.5.) Litigants, upon a showing of good cause, are given limited access\nto records of such complaints and investigations (Evid. Code, §§ 1043, 1045), but such\nrecords are otherwise ‘confidential’ and may ‘not be disclosed’ (Pen. Code, §§ 832.7,\nsubd. (a), 832.8, subd. (e)).” (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 68.) The Pitchess statutes\nrequire police departments to “establish a procedure to investigate complaints by\nmembers of the public against the personnel of these departments . . . .” (Pen. Code,\n§ 832.5, subd. (a)(1).) But Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (e) protects\n“[c]omplaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in\nwhich [an officer] participated . . . and pertaining to the manner in which he or she\nperformed his or her duties.”\n         c.     Decisional authority\n         Three recent California Supreme Court cases––Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th\n1272, CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th 278 and LBPOA, supra,59 Cal.4th 59––discuss the\n\n                                              16\n\finterplay between Pitchess protections and the PRA, and establish the framework for our\ndiscussion.\n       At issue in Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th 1272, was whether a news agency was\nentitled to records of a civil service commission regarding a deputy sheriff’s\nadministrative appeal of his termination for disciplinary reasons. The appellate court\nordered the records disclosed, reasoning that Penal Code section 832.7’s confidentiality\nprovision for “personnel records” applied only to files maintained by the employing\nagency, not information developed from other sources, even if that independently\ndeveloped information duplicated information in the personnel file. (Id. at pp. 1280–\n1281.) Because the civil service commission was not the deputy’s employing agency, the\ncourt of appeal found its records did not qualify as “‘personnel records’” protected by the\nPitchess statutes. (Copley Press, at pp. 1280–1281, 1286–1287.)\n       The Supreme Court rejected this interpretation, concluding that officers’\ndisciplinary records are privileged even where those records are generated by an outside\nagency. The court found the civil service commission records of the deputy’s appeal\nconstituted confidential “‘personnel records,’” exempt from disclosure under the Pitchess\nstatutes. (Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 1286–1296.) There is nothing in the\nlanguage or legislative history of the Pitchess statutes to suggest that a police officer’s\nprivacy rights are entitled to less protection because his or her employer uses an outside\nagency to conduct administrative appeals. (Copley Press, at p. 1295.) Copley Press also\nrejected the appellate court’s conclusion that disclosure of the identity of the appealing\ndeputy was required, noting the Pitchess statutes were “designed to protect, among other\nthings, ‘the identity of officers’ subject to [citizen] complaints.” (Copley Press, at\np. 1297, citing Pen. Code, § 832.7, subds. (a), (c).) Penal Code section 832.7 deems an\nofficer’s personnel records and information obtained from those records “confidential.”\nAccordingly, they are exempt from disclosure under the PRA. (Id. at pp. 1284–1286.)\n       In CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th 278, a newspaper was denied access to information\ncontained in a database that set minimum selection and training standards for peace\n\n                                              17\n\fofficers. The database—which included employment data on all peace officers appointed\nin California beginning in the 1970’s—was compiled from information provided by local\nlaw enforcement agencies and obtained from officers’ personnel records, and maintained\nby a public agency that did not employ the officers. (Id. at pp. 285–286.) The trial court\nordered the information (officers’ names, appointing agencies, and dates of appointment\nand termination) disclosed. The appellate court reversed. (Id. at p. 303.)\n       The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeal, found the information was not\nexempt under the Pitchess statutes, and ordered it disclosed. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th\nat pp. 298–303.) A majority of the court found, however, that information in the database\nwould be exempt from disclosure if it had been “obtained from” personnel records\nmaintained by the officers’ employing agencies. (Id. at p. 289.) Notably, the court also\nheld that information does not become confidential for purposes of the Pitchess statutes\nmerely because it is derived from a personnel file that also contains confidential\ninformation. (CPOST, at p. 289.) “[P]eace officer personnel records include only the\ntypes of information enumerated in [Penal Code] section 832.8.” (Id. at p. 293.) Because\nthe officers’ names and requested employment information were not within any\nenumerated category, that information must be disclosed. (Id. at pp. 294–299.)\n       In CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th 278, the court stressed that its decision in Copley\nPress, supra, 39 Cal.4th 1272 was expressly “qualified,” and limited to the specific\nlinking of an officer with a disciplinary hearing. (CPOST, at p. 298.) Relying on the\nstatutory language, the court narrowly construed the term “‘personal data’” as precluding\ndisclosure of sensitive information such as marital status, home address and officer\ndiscipline. (Id. at pp. 294–295.) It refused to expand the exemption, explaining that,\n“[w]ithout a more specific indication in the statute, we hesitate to conclude that the\nLegislature intended to classify the identity of a public official whose activities are a\nmatter of serious public concern as ‘personal data.’” (Id. at p. 296.)\n       Most recently, in LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th 59, the court addressed a PRA request\nfor the identities of officers involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man, as well as\n\n                                              18\n\fshootings that resulted in serious injury or death within a six-year period. (Id. at p. 71.)\nThe city and police officers resisted disclosure, arguing the information was covered by\nthe Pitchess statutes’ confidentiality protections for personnel records (Pen. Code,\n§§ 832.7, 832.8). (LBPOA, at p. 71.)\n       The California Supreme Court was not persuaded. It reaffirmed the mandate that\ncourts must adhere to limits drawn by the Legislature in the Pitchess statutes. (LBPOA,\nsupra, 59 Ca1.4th at p. 72.) Officers’ names are protected under the Pitchess statutes\nonly if linked to information in personnel records. (LBPOA, at p. 71, citing CPOST,\nsupra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 295.) Only “records generated in connection with . . . appraisal or\ndiscipline would come within the statutory definition of personnel records,” under Penal\nCode section 832.8. (LBPOA, at p. 71.) The court again refused to “read the phrase\n‘records relating to . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . [e]mployee . . . appraisal[] or discipline’ [citation]\nso broadly as to include every record that might be considered for purposes of an\nofficer’s appraisal or discipline, for such a broad reading of the statute would sweep\nvirtually all law enforcement records into the protected category of ‘personnel records.”’\n(Id. at pp. 71–72.) Only records that themselves reflect “‘advancement, appraisal or\ndiscipline’” fall within the scope of the Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d)\nexemption. (Id. at p. 78.)\n       Taken together, Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th 1272, CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th\n278 and LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th 59 reflect express limitations on the reach of the\nPitchess statutes. As succinctly summed up by the trial court, it is now established that\n“disciplinary records of peace officers are protected by privilege under the Pitchess\nstatutes no matter where those records are generated. . . . Information which is not itself\na personnel record is nevertheless protected if it was obtained from a peace officer’s\npersonnel record. . . . Only records generated in connection with an administrative\nappraisal or discipline qualify as Pitchess protected personnel records; records generated\nas part of an internal or administrative investigation of the officer generally are\nconfidential, but other records about an incident are not.”\n\n                                                  19\n\f4.     Portions of the Report are exempt from disclosure under the Act\n       There can be no legitimate dispute that the Report is a public record. The term\n“public records” is broad, and includes “any writing containing information relating to\nthe conduct of the public’s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or\nlocal agency.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).) The records here (the Report) are retained by the\nCity, a local agency, and relate to the public’s business because the City commissioned\nOIR to review and evaluate the PPD’s response in a case involving use of lethal force.\n(Cf. CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 288.) The information and analysis contained in the\nReport is precisely the sort the disclosure of which will promote public scrutiny of and\nagency accountability for specific uses of deadly force. Further, as the trial court aptly\nobserved, the Report “is aimed at the administration of the [PPD] as a whole, not the\nindividual Officers, with the goal of determining what lessons can be gleaned from the\nMcDade incident and its aftermath, and recommending institutional reforms for the\nfuture.”\n       The real issue is whether the Report is subject to an exemption. The mere fact that\nthe Report contains privileged information does not bestow protected status on the entire\ndocument. Police officer personnel records include only the type of information\nspecified in Penal Code section 832.8. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293.) Only\nrecords generated in connection with a citizen complaint, or administrative appraisal or\ndiscipline, are protected. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.)\n       a.     The Report was not prepared in response to a citizen complaint\n       Petitioners argue the Report falls within the ambit of Penal Code section 832.8,\nsubdivision (e) because the trial court found it was prepared in response to a March 25,\n2012 citizen complaint regarding the McDade shooting and contains the conclusions of\nthe OIR group, which investigated the complaint regarding the shooting. Petitioners\noverstate the record. The evidence does not clearly reflect that OIR’s retention or Report\nwas precipitated by a citizen complaint. Rather, it shows only that at an unspecified point\nafter the March 24, 2012 incident, the City “hired . . . OIR Group . . . to review the\n\n                                             20\n\fMcDade shooting incident.” The City’s return is silent as to whether the Report was\nprepared in response to a citizen complaint. However, the unchallenged declaration of\nDeputy Chief Qualls indicates OIR was not retained for that purpose. Rather, OIR was\ntasked with conducting an assessment and preparing a Report to “review . . . the incident\nfor the benefit of the department and to evaluate how the department does business in the\nareas reviewed.” The record also reflects that the PPD itself investigated the citizen\ncomplaint in the course of its CID and IA investigations.\n       b.     Portions of the Report are related to the administrative investigation of the\nofficers and are therefore exempt from disclosure.\n       The PPD commissioned OIR to prepare the Report for two related, broad\npurposes; (1) to analyze the McDade shooting and its aftermath for the purpose of\ndetermining what lessons could be learned from the incident; and (2) to recommend\ninstitutional reforms. There is no indication it was intended to be used in connection with\nperformance appraisals, or the advancement or discipline of the officers, and the PPD has\nexpressly affirmed that the Report will not be considered in future employment decisions\ninvolving those officers. Although the McDade shooting was the catalyst for the Report\nand provided the lens through which OIR focused its evaluation, the Report looks beyond\nthe conduct of the individual officers. It presents an overview of the PPD’s criminal and\nadministrative investigations into the shooting, evaluates the manner in which the PPD’s\nprocedures and practices may have fallen short, and recommends institutional\nimprovements. Any analyses in the Report are aimed at the PPD’s training, tactics and\nreview process in the wake of the McDade shooting, not the individual officers, even\nthough those analyses use the actions of the officers as a springboard to assess the\nagency’s conduct.\n       Petitioners have the burden to prove the Report is exempt from disclosure under\nsection 6254, subdivision (k) by virtue of the Pitchess statutes. In a situation involving\nan officer’s use of lethal force against an unarmed suspect, the public’s interest in\ndisclosure is “particularly great,” because such incidents raise serious questions about\n\n                                             21\n\fgovernmental policies regarding law enforcement and public safety. (LBPOA, supra, 59\nCal.4th at p. 74.) Nevertheless, in enacting the Pitchess statutes, the Legislature made a\npolicy determination that the desirability for confidentiality in police personnel matters\noutweighs the public’s interest in openness. (Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 1298.)\n       As the trial court correctly found, the Report contains privileged information. The\nprotection for personnel records under section 6254, subdivision (k) applies to any\ninformation obtained from an officer’s personnel records. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 289.) Accordingly, portions of the Report culled from personnel information or\nofficers’ statements made in the course of the PPD’s administrative investigation of the\nMcDade shooting are protected by the Pitchess statutes. However, other portions of the\nReport, including the CID investigation, which do not constitute or relate to employee\nappraisal, are not. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.)\n       c.     Nonprivileged portions of the Report are not so intertwined with privileged\nportions as to render the entire Report exempt from disclosure\n       Implicitly conceding that information from the criminal investigation must be\ndisclosed, petitioners argue that information in the Report gleaned from the CID and\nadministrative investigations is inextricably intertwined because the PPD relied heavily\non the CID investigation to conduct its administrative review, and OIR had access to all\nthe PPD’s investigative materials. Relying on the decisions in Berkeley Police Assn. v.\nCity of Berkeley (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 385 (Berkeley) and Davis v. City of San Diego\n(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 893 (Davis), petitioners argue that derivative information from\npersonnel files became so intertwined with the CID investigation that none of the Report\nmay be disclosed.\n       In Berkeley, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 385, the court addressed the question of\nwhether proceedings conducted by a police review commission, established in order to\ninvestigate citizens’ complaints but which do not impose discipline, fell within Penal\nCode section 832.5. The commission was a standing body that received written citizen\ncomplaints, investigated the allegations and held public hearings on the complaints at\n\n                                             22\n\fwhich the officer was required to provide information. The commission then announced\nits findings on the allegations. (Id. at p. 391.) The court found that the commission\nproceedings “fit the description of [a] [Penal Code] section 832.5” proceeding, and its\npractice of holding public hearings on citizen complaints violated Penal Code section\n832.7, subdivision (a), by disclosing confidential police officer personnel information.\n(Id. at pp. 402, 404–405.)\n       In Davis, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th 893, the court enjoined a city from releasing a\nreport about a shooting prepared by a permanent citizens’ review board established to\nreview citizen complaints, because the report was derived almost entirely from records\nrelating to a complaint. The report, compiled from personnel records, was itself a\npersonnel record. (Id. at p. 900.)\n       Here the trial court properly rejected petitioners’ factually unsupported contention\nthat information regarding the administrative investigation is inextricably intertwined\nwith the criminal investigation so as to render the entire Report exempt. Material from\nthe criminal investigation was generated independently and in advance of the\nadministrative investigation. Officers’ personnel records include only the type of\ninformation enumerated in Penal Code section 832.8 (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 293), and only records generated in connection with an administrative appraisal or\ndiscipline are protected. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.) The City acknowledges,\nand the trial court found, that information obtained from the administrative investigation\ncan be separated from information derived from other sources. That factual\ndetermination finds substantial evidentiary support.\n       Where, as here, nonexempt materials are not inextricably intertwined with exempt\nmaterials and are reasonably separable, segregation is required. (See § 6253, subd. (a)\n[“Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection by any\nperson requesting the record after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law”];\nCBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653 [“The fact that parts of a requested\ndocument fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire\n\n                                            23\n\fdocument”].) As proponents of nondisclosure, petitioners bear the “‘burden of\nproof . . . of . . . demonstrat[ing] a “clear overbalance” on the side of confidentiality.’”\n(CBS Broadcasting, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 908.) “[M]ere\nassertion[s]” and conjecture will not suffice. (CBS, Inc. v. Block, at pp. 652–653.)\nPetitioners have not met their burden.\n       Furthermore, as the trial court observed, the City would face significant problems\nif its criminal and administrative investigations were not independent. The criminal\ninvestigation was conducted solely “to determine whether a crime occurred. It [wa]s not\nconducted for the purpose of an appraisal of officers, for the consideration of\ndiscipline . . . .” Information obtained during the criminal investigation is not\nadministrative information protected by the Pitchess statutes. Records related to the\ncriminal investigation are not personnel records, and do not reveal information regarding\n“advancement, appraisal, or discipline” of a particular officer. Only the PPD’s\nadministrative review results in a disciplinary recommendation to the Chief. And, only\nrecords related to that process enjoy protection under the Pitchess statutes.\n       d.     The PRA does not exempt any record that theoretically could be used in\npersonnel decisions\n       Seeking to expand the PRA’s reach, petitioners invite us to find that in addition to\nrecords generated in connection with “advancement, appraisal, or discipline,” Penal Code\nsection 832.8, subdivision (d) should be read to encompass records—like the entire\nReport—that contain information that “could be used” for such purposes. We may not\nand would not do so. Appellate courts “‘do not sit as super-legislatures to determine the\nwisdom, desirability or propriety of statutes enacted by the Legislature.’ [Citation.] The\nrewriting of a statute is a legislative, rather than a judicial function, a practice in which\nwe will not engage.” (California State University Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Superior Court\n(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 828, 830 [refusing to extend coverage of PRA to\nnongovernmental auxiliary organization of state university because the organization was\nnot a “state agency” as defined by the Act].)\n\n                                               24\n\f       The California Supreme Court has made clear that personnel records are confined\nto the type of information enumerated in Penal Code section 832.8. (CPOST, supra, 42\nCal.4th at p. 293.) Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d) cannot be read so broadly\nas to include an entire third-party report regarding the PPD’s practice in addressing the\naftermath of a fatal shooting. Only a small portion of the Report relates to officer\n“advancement, appraisal, or discipline.” Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion that the overarching purpose of the Report is not related to officer appraisal or\ndiscipline. Further, based on the sworn declaration of Deputy Chief Qualls, the PPD\nwould be barred from considering the Report in future employment-related decisions\nregarding these officers. Petitioners dismiss this unequivocal and unchallenged evidence\nas “speculation,” offering their own speculation that the City could use the Report in a\nfuture review of the officers. Petitioners’ argument ignores the express limitations\ncontained in Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d), and the Supreme Court’s mandate\nin CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293, and would extend the statute beyond its limited\npurpose.\n5.     PRA privilege has not been waived\n       a.     The privilege was not waived when the officers placed personnel\ninformation in the public domain.\n       Interveners argue that petitioners cannot establish that they will suffer harm if the\nReport is publicly disclosed because the officers waived any right of confidentiality as to\ninformation in the public domain, information the officers themselves voluntarily\nreleased. Accordingly, to the extent redactions ordered by the trial court—even those\nwhich recite to or rely on the administrative investigation, and thus would otherwise be\nprivileged—include information in the public domain, Interveners maintain the officers\nwaived any exemption to disclosure under the PRA. We disagree.\n       In connection with a summary judgment motion in Slaughter’s federal action, the\nofficers filed with the court excerpts from their own deposition transcripts, among others.\nThose transcripts contain testimony by the officers about their recollections of the\n\n                                             25\n\fMcDade shooting, and their conduct, concerns and strategies. Transcripts of others’\ndepositions, such as PPD Chief Sanchez, reveal information about officer training and a\nprior OIR report regarding a 2009 officer involved shooting. The transcripts also reflect\nthat the officers used statements they voluntarily gave in the course of the CID\ninvestigation to refresh their recollections at deposition, thereby waiving protection for\nthose statements in that litigation. (Evid. Code, § 771, subds (a), (b).)13 The officers’\ndeposition testimony was given voluntarily, none of the transcripts was filed under seal\nand the officers chose not to shield their testimony or submissions or to seek a protective\norder.14 “‘Court records are public records, available to the public in general.’” (Hurvitz\nv. Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246.) These court records have been publically\navailable since January 2014.\n       But the officers’ public revelation of confidential information does not constitute\nwaiver as to privileged information in the Report. (See Fagan v. Superior Court (2003)\n111 Cal.App.4th 607, 617 (Fagan).)15 The fact that information in an officer’s personnel\n\n\n\n       13Evidentiary protections for the statements was waived. The Evidence Code\nprovides: “if a witness, either while testifying or prior thereto, uses a writing to refresh\nhis memory with respect to any matter about which he testifies, such writing must be\nproduced at the hearing at the request of an adverse party and, unless the writing is so\nproduced . . . . [¶] . . . [T]he adverse party may . . . inspect the writing . . . and introduce\nin evidence such portion of it as may be pertinent to the testimony of the witness.” (Evid.\nCode, § 771, subds. (a), (b); People v. Smith (2007) 40 Cal.4th 483, 508–509.)\n       14Police officers have a statutory right to request a protective order when their\nconfidential records are used in court actions. (Evid. Code, § 1045, subd. (d).)\n       15 In Fagan, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th 607, a prosecutor obtained the results of a\nurinalysis from officers’ personnel records for use in a criminal investigation against the\nofficers. (Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (a).) (Id. at pp. 610, 615–616.) Upon receipt of a\nPRA request, the district attorney sought publicly to release the results, arguing they lost\ntheir confidential status once obtained by his office. (Id. at pp. 610, 617.) The appellate\ncourt rejected the argument concluding that Pitchess protections are not lost for\ninformation obtained from an officer’s personnel file just because that information is\ndisclosed in a criminal or civil action. (Fagan, at p. 617.)\n\n                                              26\n\frecords may also be found in an unprotected source does not impact the confidentiality of\nthe personnel records themselves. The “Pitchess statutes create a privilege for all\ninformation in peace officers’ personnel files without regard to information found\nelsewhere.” (Hackett v. Superior Court (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 96, 97, 100.) The\npurpose and policy of the Pitchess statutes mandates that waiver of the privilege must be\nexpress. This is true even where, as here, the officers themselves placed the information\nin the public domain.\n       Absent an express waiver of the privilege with respect to the confidential,\npersonnel information found in the Report, the officers retain Pitchess protections as to\nthat information, even if the information is the same as or similar to information available\nelsewhere in the public domain. (See CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 296, fn. 5 [“We do\nnot suggest that the mere fact that officers’ names are available from other sources\nnecessarily means that the information cannot be considered personal or private”]; United\nStates DOD v. FLRA (1994) 510 U.S. 487, 500 [114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325] [“An\nindividual’s [privacy] interest in controlling the dissemination of information regarding\npersonal matters does not dissolve simply because that information may be available to\nthe public in some form”].)\n       The officers did not waive privilege as to information in the Report they placed in\nthe public domain. The trial court correctly concluded that redaction was in order for\nthose portions of the Report that contain advancement, appraisal, or discipline\ninformation, or were derived from the administrative record.\n       b.     The privilege was not waived when the City gave the Report to petitioners\n       Nor did waiver occur by virtue of the City’s provision of the Report to petitioners.\nGenerally speaking, once disclosed to a member of the public, a record becomes\navailable for public inspection. (Black Panther Party v. Kehoe (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d\n645, 656–657, § 6254.5.) But waiver occurs only if the agency discloses a document to a\n“member of the public.” (§ 6254.5.) The statutory privilege of confidentiality in\nofficers’ personnel records is held both by the City and the officers. (City of Hemet v.\n\n                                            27\n\fSuperior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1430–1431.) Petitioners had a right to\nreview the Report to ascertain which portions they contend are privileged. (§ 3306.5.)\nThey cannot be denied access to their own personnel records for fear that permitting\naccess will waive confidentiality. It was not improper for the City to share the Report in\nconfidence with petitioners, and no waiver may be implied therefrom.\n       c.     No waiver by public disclosure of redacted material on appeal\n       As noted above, petitioners publicly filed a Reply brief containing verbatim\nexcerpts of the Report, i.e., significant portions of the very material they contend is\nconfidential. The Slaughter parties insist that such disclosure constitutes “changed\ncircumstances” which operate to waive any privilege that may arguably have attached to\nthe disclosed material. We disagree.\n       Just as petitioners’ public disclosure of their deposition testimony in Slaughter’s\nfederal action against them did not operate to waive their right of confidentiality as to\nprotected personnel records, their disclosure in this proceeding of excerpts from the\nReport does not operate as a waiver of their right to confidentiality. As explained by the\ntrial court, “[i]nformation obtained from a police officer’s personnel record is protected.”\n(See CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 289.) In CPOST, the Supreme Court held that an\nofficer could not waive the privilege as to such information without expressly doing so.\nNo express waiver occurred here. To paraphrase CPOST, “the mere fact that [privileged\npersonnel information is] available from other sources [does not] necessarily mean[] that\nthe information cannot be considered personal or private.” (Id. at p. 296, fn. 5; see\nDepartment of Defense v. FLRA, supra, 510 U.S. at p. 500 [individual’s privacy interest\nin controlling dissemination of information regarding personal matters “does not dissolve\nsimply because that information may be available to the public in some form”].)16\n\n\n       16  We agree with petitioners that questionable police shootings and recent unrest\nthroughout the country does not bear on the issue of petitioners’ right to confidentiality as\nto portions of the Report. As profoundly troubling as these events are and have been, and\nas significant as the public interest is in the complex and nuanced debate surrounding\n\n                                             28\n\f6.     The trial court applied the PRA exemption too broadly\n       Our review of the Report reveals the trial court’s redactions are overbroad.\nInformation properly classified as personnel records must be redacted from the Report.\nThe remainder, however, including analyses of the PPD’s response to and handling of the\ninvestigation of the McDade shooting, and OIR’s recommendations for institutional\nreform, must be disclosed publicly. “The fact that parts of a requested document fall\nwithin the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire document.”\n(CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653; § 6253, subd. (a) [“[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection . . . after deletion of the\nportions that are exempted by law”].)\n       Petitioners, of course, argue that not enough information was redacted from the\nReport. Interveners, who chose not to seek review under section 6259, argue that too\nmuch information was redacted. We invited and have considered the parties’ arguments\non the question of the scope of this court’s authority to grant relief not sought in the only\npetition before us. We conclude that this court has the authority to determine whether the\ntrial court erred in ordering the current breadth of redactions from the Report, a\ndetermination which encompasses within its scope both the issue of whether the trial\ncourt redacted too little (petitioners’ position) or too much (Interveners’ position).\n       We conclude that the issue of the appropriate extent of redactions is encompassed\nwithin the scope of the challenged judgment. Because the Report has remained sealed\nthroughout this litigation, Interveners have no way to ascertain that too much information\n\n\n\npolice use of force and allegations of institutional racism, those issues do not bear\ndirectly on the circumstances at issue here. Such events (which occurred outside of\nPasadena) and concerns do not negate the statutory Pitchess protections as they apply to\nthe officers. (Pen. Code, §§ 832.7, 832.8.) For this reason––and for the independent\nreason that we have no need to consult the PRA’s Legislative history––we deny the\nTimes’ request for judicial notice (See Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th\n408, 418 [judicial notice will not be granted unless matter for which judicial notice is\nsought is relevant and helpful toward resolving matters at issue].)\n\n                                              29\n\fwas culled from the Report. Because the trial court articulated the correct legal standard,\nthey may reasonably have concluded there was no basis upon which to seek review.\nPrinciples of equity and those outlined in Code of Civil Procedure section 906 require\nthat the court’s redaction order be modified even though the grounds justifying that\nmodification were not raised by petitioners and Interveners did not file their own cross-\npetitions. Specifically, that statute provides that “the reviewing court may review . . . any\nintermediate ruling, proceeding, order or decision which involves the merits or\nnecessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the\nrights of a party . . . , and may affirm, reverse or modify any judgment or order appealed\nfrom and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered . . . .” The Legislature\nhas recognized the inherent authority of courts to manage their proceedings and adopt\nsuitable methods of practice. Every court has the power “[t]o amend and control its\nprocess and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 128, subd. (a)(8); see Code Civ. Proc., § 187 [“When jurisdiction is, by the\nConstitution . . . or by any . . . statute, conferred on a Court . . ., all the means necessary\nto carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course\nof proceeding be not specifically pointed out by . . . statute, any suitable process or mode\nof proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this\nCode”].)\n       “It is also well established that[, independent of any statutory authority,] courts\nhave fundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and administrative powers, as well as\ninherent power to control litigation before them.” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc.\n(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967; see Stephen Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co. (2007) 155\nCal.App.4th 736, 758 [“From their creation by article VI, section 1 of the California\nConstitution, California courts received broad inherent power ‘not confined by or\ndependent on statutes,’” which includes the “‘inherent power to control litigation’”].)\nThese principles apply equally on appeal or in a writ proceeding. Where, as here, an\nissue in the case was necessarily encompassed by the questions raised in the writ petition,\n\n                                               30\n\f“fully briefed in the trial court,” and is “an issue of law,” we may review that issue and\ngrant affirmative relief to a party who did not file a writ petition, even where the trial\ncourt found in favor of petitioner on that issue. (See Securitas Security Services USA,\nInc. v. Superior Court (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1125.)\n       The City maintains it would be prejudiced by a grant of relief beyond that sought\nby petitioners (i.e., fewer redactions from the Report), as it has not yet had an opportunity\nto brief the issue. This contention is meritless. The City has had (and has taken) the\nopportunity to address the propriety of redacting portions of the Report, both here and\nbefore the trial court. Indeed, it urges us to find that the trial court’s redactions\nappropriately protect the officers. Further, the City has been on notice since before it\nfiled its Return that Interveners would urge this court to conclude that the Report was\nover redacted.\n       The question of whether the trial court erred regarding the extent of its redactions\nis a question of law, fully briefed and embraced within the challenged order. Petitioners\nopened the door to this issue by filing a writ petition challenging the scope of the court’s\nredactions. They have invited this court to review the challenged order in its entirety and\nto scrutinize specific redactions made by the trial court. We conclude that the principles\nembraced by Code of Civil Procedure sections 906, 128 and 187, considered in light of\nthe PRA’s goal to accelerate appellate review, not limit its scope (Times Mirror Co. v.\nSuperior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1334), militate in favor of a determination that the\ntrial court failed to adhere to the rule it correctly articulated, and an order directing the\ncourt to release additional nonprivileged portions of the Report.\n       Information not obtained from findings of an internal or administrative\ninvestigation of the officers, or the privileged personnel records of any officer, is not\nshielded from disclosure. The Pitchess statutes do not exempt “every record that might\nbe considered for purposes of an officer’s appraisal.” (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 72; accord, CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293 [Pitchess statutes do not exempt\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\finformation “merely because [it] is contained in a file that also includes the type of\nconfidential information specified in” Pen. Code, §§ 832.5–832.8].)\n       “Appraisal,” as that term is employed in the Pitchess statutes, does not encompass\nreview of an agency’s practices and procedures. “The people have the right of access to\ninformation concerning the conduct of the people’s business,” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3,\nsubd. (b)), and their right of access must be “broadly construed.” The public’s interest in\ndisclosure is “particularly great” where, as here, the underlying case involves an officer\ninvolved shootings and policies regarding public safety and law enforcement. (LBPOA,\nsupra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 74.) No Pitchess protections statutes attach to material in the\nReport derived primarily from non-confidential records not intended to be part of the\nofficers’ personnel matters or to be used in connection with officer advancement,\nappraisal or disciplinary proceedings. A number of redactions proposed by the City and\nlargely adopted by the trial court protected not privileged information relating to the\nofficers, but information or findings critiquing conduct by or the policies and practice of\nthe PPD itself. Any redaction of such material subverts the public’s right to “‘be kept\nfully informed of the activities of its peace officers’” “‘[i]n order to maintain trust in its\npolice department[].’” (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 297.)\n       Appendix A to this decision, filed under seal, contains a nonexhaustive list of\nmaterial in the Report erroneously redacted by the trial court. On remand, the trial court,\nafter revisiting the Report and bearing the principles articulated in this opinion in mind,\nmay conclude that additional information must also publically be released. Accordingly,\nwe will deny the petition and remand the matter to the superior court with directions to\nconduct the additional proceedings it deems appropriate and issue a new or modified\njudgment ordering additional redactions in accordance with this opinion. When that\njudgment issues, appendix A shall be immediately unsealed.17\n\n\n       17\n       In connection with proceedings on remand, we note the following: On\nNovember 4, 2014, the trial court ordered the City to lodge two documents under seal:\n\n                                               32\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The petition is denied. The matter is remanded to the trial court to conduct\nadditional proceedings to reconsider which portions of the Office of Independent Review\nGroup’s August 2014 report of the City of Pasadena concerning the officer involved\nshooting of Kendrec McDade contain confidential personnel records and order additional\nmaterial released, including appendix A hereto, and to issue a new or modified judgment\nin conformance with this opinion.

As submitted under seal in this court,\nunredacted pages 55, 57 and 58 remain attached to the redacted Report ordered released\non November 13, 2014. We assume the trial court did not intend to include this\nunredacted material in the redacted version of the Report it ordered released.

After OIR\ncompleted its review, real parties in interest and interveners the Los Angeles Times\n(Times), and real parties in interest and interveners, Anya Slaughter, Kris Ockershauser,\nthe Pasadena Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople, ACT, the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of the Greater Pasadena\n(collectively, the Slaughter parties or, when mentioned in conjunction with the Times,\nInterveners), made requests under the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code,1 § 6250\net seq.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)) (PRA or the Act) seeking disclosure of the\nOIR’s August 2014 “Report to the City of Pasadena Concerning the Officer-Involved\nShooting of . . . McDade” (Report).\n       Petitioners the Pasadena Police Officers Association (PPOA) and Pasadena Police\nOfficers Matthew Griffin and Jeffrey Newlen (the officers or, in conjunction with the\nPPOA, collectively, petitioners) initiated this reverse PRA action, seeking to enjoin\ndisclosure of the Report. After initially issuing a temporary restraining order, the trial\ncourt eventually permitted the Times and Slaughter parties to intervene, denied the\ninjunction, and ordered the Report publically released. However, the trial court found\n\n\n       1All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n                                              2\n\fcertain portions of the Report constituted confidential peace officer personnel records,\nexempt from disclosure pursuant to section 6254, subdivision (k), and ordered those\nportions redacted. The court stayed the effect of its judgment to permit parties to seek\nextraordinary writ relief. (§ 6259, subd. (c).)\n       We deny the petition by which PPOA and the officers seek to preclude disclosure\nof the entire Report or, in the alternative, the production of a more heavily redacted\nReport. The trial court correctly concluded that the Report itself is a public document.\nThe court also correctly determined that portions of the Report contain confidential\npersonnel information exempt from disclosure under the PRA. The trial court’s\nredactions, however, went too far. Our review of the sealed materials in the record\nreveals that some of the material the court ordered redacted from the Report is unrelated\nto personnel files of individual officers. The inappropriately redacted material includes\nanalyses of the PPD’s administrative investigation and departmental policies, descriptions\nof the PPD’s responsiveness (or the absence thereof), and recommendations by the OIR,\nnone of which is privileged under the PRA. 2 Accordingly, we deny the petition and\nremand the matter to the superior court with directions to conduct new proceedings, and\nissue a new or modified judgment ordering appropriate redactions to the Report in\naccordance with this opinion.\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On March 24, 2012, just after 11:00 p.m., the officers responded to a 911 call.\nThe caller claimed to have been robbed at gunpoint by two men. Much later, the caller\nadmitted he had falsely reported that the robbers were armed.\n       Responding to the dispatch broadcast, the officers proceeded in their squad car to\nthe area of the alleged crime. As they approached the intersection, McDade, a 19-year-\n\n       2 As discussed in section 6 below, the material we deem inappropriately redacted\nwas filed under seal.

Appendix A will remain\nsealed until the superior court issues a new judgment (see below).\n\n                                              3\n\fold African-American male, began running. The officers pursued McDade about two\nblocks. Officer Griffin fired four shots at McDade from inside the patrol car. Officer\nNewlen, having previously exited the squad car to give chase, fired four more shots,\nkilling McDade. It was later discovered that McDade was not armed.\n       The shooting spawned multiple investigations, a citizen’s complaint (filed on\nMarch 25, 2012), and a federal lawsuit by McDade’s mother, Anya Slaughter, against the\nofficers and the City. The Los Angeles District Attorney conducted a criminal\ninvestigation which concluded with a finding that, due to the false report, the officers\nreasonably had believed McDade was armed. No criminal charges were filed against the\nofficers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a civil rights investigation of the\nshooting, which ultimately was closed without the filing of criminal charges or a civil\ncomplaint. Slaughter’s federal action against the City and the officers was settled.\n       The PPD conducted its own investigations. Two were conducted immediately\nafter the McDade shooting. The purpose of the first investigation, undertaken by the\nPPD’s Criminal Investigations Division (CID), was to determine whether the officers\ncommitted a crime. Different PPD investigators conducted a separate Internal Affairs\n(IA) investigation. The PPD investigated the March 25, 2012 citizen complaint in the\ncourse of its CID and IA investigations. In March 2013, the PPD conducted a third\ninvestigation: an administrative review based on evidence collected during the CID and\nIA investigations. That administrative review concluded with a determination that the\nofficers acted within departmental policy because they reasonably had believed McDade\nwas armed and assaulting an officer, and shot him in self-defense and in defense of one\nanother.\n       The officers were interrogated and gave voluntary statements to investigators in\nthe course of the CID investigation. Those statements were considered as part of the\ndistrict attorney’s analysis in determining whether to file criminal charges. The officers\nwere deposed in Slaughter’s federal civil rights action against them. At their depositions\nthe officers were questioned about the shooting and the subsequent investigations, and\n\n                                             4\n\feach used the statement he had given during the CID investigation to refresh his\nrecollection.3 The officers did not provide additional statements in connection with\neither the IA investigation or the PPD’s administrative review.\n       On an unspecified date soon after the shooting in March 2012 the City retained\nOIR as a private consultant to conduct an independent review of the McDade shooting.\nAccording to the declaration submitted in this action by PPD Deputy Chief Darryl Qualls,\n“[t]he purpose of the OIR Group’s review, memorialized in the OIR Report, was to serve\nas a review of the incident for the benefit of the department and to evaluate how the\n[PPD] does business in the areas reviewed.” Deputy Chief Qualls also declared that the\nPPD would not use OIR’s Report “to (1) affect the officers’ advancement; (2) conduct an\nappraisal of the officers; or (3) consider discipline of the officers.” After reviewing the\nReport and other evidence, the trial court found the City retained OIR in order to evaluate\nthe thoroughness and objectivity of the PPD’s investigations of the McDade shooting, the\nadequacy of officer training, what lessons had been learned from the incident and, based\non OIR’s review and conclusions, to recommend institutional reforms.\n       OIR’s 70-page Report was completed in August 2014. Interveners submitted\nrequests to the City for the Report on the McDade shooting, pursuant to the PRA. On\nSeptember 3, 2014, while the PRA requests remained pending, PPOA and the officers\ninitiated the underlying reverse PRA action, and sought and obtained a temporary\nrestraining order (TRO) preventing release of the Report. On September 9, 2014, the trial\ncourt vacated the TRO on the ground the matter was not yet ripe, and ordered the City to\nrespond to the Interveners’ PRA requests and to give petitioners notice if it intended to\ndisclose the Report. Interveners submitted new or renewed PRA requests for the Report\nto the City on September 9, 2014.\n\n\n       3 Transcripts of the officers’ depositions have been publicly available since\nJanuary 2014. Their statements from the CID investigation were not attached as exhibits\nto those transcripts.\n\n                                              5\n\f       On September 11, 2014, the City announced that unless the court directed\notherwise, it planned to release a redacted copy of the Report the following week. The\nCity stated it intended to redact portions of the Report containing confidential police\nofficer personnel records. 4\n       On September 16, 2014, petitioners filed an ex parte application seeking to enjoin\nthe City from releasing any portion of the Report. The same day, the Times and others\nfiled motions seeking to intervene in this action and writ petitions seeking to compel\nrelease of the Report without redactions. The trial court granted leave to intervene.\n       On October 16, 2014, after extensive briefing and oral argument, the trial court\nissued a 16-page “Decision on Application for Injunctive Relief-Partly Granted.” The\ncourt acknowledged the parties’ competing positions regarding disclosure of the Report:\nConsistent with their positions here, Interveners argued the Report is a public record and\nshould be disclosed in its entirety. Petitioners asserted that the Report is a confidential\npersonnel record entirely exempt from disclosure under the Pitchess5 statutes (Pen. Code,\n§§ 832.5, 832.7, 832.8) and the privilege exemption of the PRA (Gov. Code, § 6254,\nsubd. (k).) The City argued that all but about 20 percent of the Report (which it agreed\nwas confidential personnel information) should be disclosed.\n       The trial court found the Report was indisputably a “public record,” in which the\n“public’s interest in disclosure . . . is ‘particularly great’ because it relates to ‘officer\ninvolved shootings’ and governmental policies regarding law enforcement and public\nsafety.” The court also found that specific portions of the Report constituted confidential\npersonnel records, exempt from disclosure under section 6254, subdivision (k).\n       Before the trial court, Interveners argued the officers had waived any arguable\nprivilege or exemption from disclosure of the Report by placing much of the information\n\n\n       4The City chose to waive its right to assert an additional PRA exemption from\ndisclosure for law enforcement investigatory files.

No protective order was sought and those\ntranscripts were not filed under seal. At his deposition, each officer had testified about\nthe circumstances surrounding the McDade shooting, including his own actions, tactics\nand concerns. The officers also used the statements they made to detectives during the\nCID investigation to refresh their recollections. The court rejected Interveners’ assertion\nof waiver. It concluded that, although “the Officers may have waived any confidentiality\nassociated with the information or communications in the public domain,” information\ncontained in or derived from their personnel files retained its confidential status\nregardless of whether it was also available elsewhere in an unprotected document.\n       Interveners also argued that the officers and the City waived confidentiality and\nprivilege exemptions once the City disclosed the Report to petitioners. In other words,\nhaving disclosed the Report to members of the public (i.e., the officers), the City was\nrequired to make the Report available for public inspection. The court also rejected this\ncontention. It observed that police officers have a statutory right to inspect their\npersonnel files. (§ 3306.5.) The privilege of confidentiality in officers’ personnel\nrecords belongs to the officers as well as to the City. The officers had a right to review\nthe Report in order to determine whether to assert confidentiality as to some or all of it.\n       In conclusion, the trial court found that those portions of the Report that “‘recite[]\nor rel[y] upon the administrative investigation’” are exempt from disclosure under the\nPitchess statutes. It found the administrative and criminal investigations were clearly\nseparate investigations. The latter investigation did not constitute a personnel record and\ndid “not reveal any information about the ‘advancement, appraisal, or discipline’ of a\nparticular officer. See Penal Code [section] 832.8[, subdivision] (d).” (Italics omitted.)\nHowever, an administrative investigation that “results in a disciplinary recommendation\nto the Chief of Police, and the administrative process [are] protected by the Pitchess\nstatutes.” The court concluded that those portions of the Report containing privileged\n\n                                              7\n\fpersonnel information generated in connection with the PPD’s internal administrative\ninvestigation qualified for protection and must be redacted.\n       On November 13, 2014, after reviewing the City’s and petitioners’ proposed\nredactions to the Report, the trial court entered judgment and ordered release of the\nredacted Report. The trial court vacated its September 16, 2014 TRO, but stayed the\neffect of its vacation order and judgment for 20 days to permit the parties to seek review\nof the judgment.\n       On November 26, 2014, petitioners filed the instant petition for writ of mandate\nwith this court, seeking review of the trial court’s disclosure order. No other party filed a\npetition. We stayed the trial court’s order pending our decision, and requested briefing.\n(§ 6259, subd. (c).)\nSubsequent events at the Court of Appeal\n       1.     Petitioners’ publicly filed reply brief containing redacted material is\nsealed, then reinstated\n       On March 16, 2015, petitioners filed a “Reply to Preliminary Opposition to [the\nTimes’] Petition for Writ of Mandate and Opposition to Petition for Writ of Mandate”\n(Reply brief). 6 On March 25, 2015, petitioners notified this court that the Reply brief\nfiled on March 16 “inadvertently, and mistakenly, included verbatim excerpts of the\nOIR[] Report,” which are the subject of this proceeding and among the materials\npetitioners maintain are confidential peace officer personnel records. Petitioners asked\nthis court to seal their March 16, 2015 Reply brief, requested permission to substitute an\naccompanying redacted reply brief (omitting the Report’s excerpts) in the public record,\nand requested an order requiring the parties to return the March 16 Reply brief. On\nMarch 25, 2015, we granted petitioners’ request.\n\n\n\n\n       6 The Reply brief also responded to the City’s January 5, 2015, opposition to the\npetition for writ of mandate.\n\n                                              8\n\f       Interveners reacted immediately, requesting that we vacate our March 25 order.\nThey argued that, in the guise of a perfunctory administrative request to remedy a filing\nmistake, petitioners’ March 25 motion actually sought an unconstitutional prior restraint\non speech and sealing order. 7 Interveners noted that they and numerous third parties\nlawfully received the unredacted Reply brief (which was publicly available for nine days\nbefore the motion to seal was filed). Accordingly, they argued that any order punishing\nor preventing dissemination of information in the March 16 Reply brief was a\npresumptively unconstitutional First Amendment violation, as to which petitioners could\nnot satisfy the stringent burden necessary to justify retroactive secreting of the Reply\nbrief. On March 27, 2015, Interveners notified this court of their discovery (after filing\ntheir March 26 opposition to the motion to seal) that much of the information from\npetitioners’ publically available Reply brief had been disseminated in an article published\non March 25, 2015 by the Pasadena Star News, a nonparty media group.\n       In response, petitioners argued they were not required to provide advance notice or\nan opportunity to respond in connection with their motion to seal, that this court’s\nMarch 25 order was not an unconstitutional prior restraint, and that Interveners had\nunlawfully released the sealed reply brief after we issued our March 25 order. 8\n       On April 1, 2015, this court notified the parties that it was considering vacating its\nMarch 25, 2015 order sealing petitioners’ March 16 Reply brief, and gave the parties an\n\n       7 Interveners also claimed they were deprived of notice of and an opportunity to be\nheard as to the motion to seal. The record indicates that petitioners served the motion to\nseal on all parties on March 24, 2015. But Interveners argued that petitioners effected\nservice by mail in a “transparent”––and successful––attempt to ensure Interveners would\nnot learn of the motion until after this court issued an order.\n       8  In a declaration by Michelle White (who is neither a party to this action herself,\nnor affiliated with any party), filed on March 30, 2015, Interveners denied that the Times\nsupplied the unredacted Reply brief to the Star News, or supplied the information to any\nmedia group after we issued the March 25, 2015 order. White declared that she received\nthe unredacted Reply brief on March 19 from counsel for the Slaughter parties, and\nprovided information from that brief to nonparty media outlets before March 25, 2015.\n\n                                              9\n\fopportunity to respond. They did so and, on April 17, 2015, we vacated our March 25\norder, and unsealed and reinstated petitioners’ March 16, 2015 Reply brief in its entirety.\n       2.     The Slaughter parties move to dismiss this proceeding\n       On April 20, 2015, the Slaughter parties filed a motion to dismiss writ proceeding\nand to remand to trial court with instructions (motion to dismiss). They argued that\nbecause petitioners’ counsel publically filed the Reply brief containing a significant\nportion of the material petitioners seek here to suppress without contemporaneously\nasserting privilege on behalf of the officers, petitioners waived any privilege that may\nhave attached with respect to the Report. In short, they asserted that this writ proceeding\nhad been rendered moot. The Slaughter parties also argued that, in addition to dismissing\nthe petition, this court should remand the matter with instructions to the trial court to\nissue an order to show cause to determine whether the entire unredacted Report should be\nreleased to Interveners.\n       Petitioners and the City each opposed the motion to dismiss. The City took no\nposition with respect to a straightforward dismissal of this action. However, because the\nSlaughter parties chose not to file a writ petition seeking affirmative relief pursuant to\nsection 6259, subdivision (c),9 both the City and petitioners opposed the motion to the\nextent the Slaughter parties requested that dismissal be accompanied by an order\ndirecting the trial court to conduct additional proceedings. 10 Petitioners also argued that\nthe motion to dismiss must be denied because there was no basis for this court to\nconclude the matter was moot. 11\n\n\n       9 See MinCal Consumer Law Group v.

The court invites briefing\n       As noted above, no Intervener filed a petition seeking issuance of an extraordinary\nwrit following the trial court’s November 13, 2014 judgment. Nevertheless, collectively,\nInterveners seek affirmative relief in this action. They urge this court to find that, under\nthe guise of protecting statutorily privileged personnel information, the trial court’s ruling\nerroneously shields from disclosure information which must be publically released,\nspecifically criticisms in the Report of the PPD’s administrative review. On April 22,\n2015, we invited the parties to submit letter briefs addressing the issue of “[w]hat, if any,\nauthority . . . this Court [has] to consider/grant relief sought by Interveners?” The parties\nresponded, submitting initial and responsive letter briefs.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       Petitioners maintain the trial court’s order must be reversed. They contend that the\nentire Report is privileged because it “is, in effect, a personnel file, or at the very least,\nsubstantial parts of the [Report] which the Court below refused to redact are clearly\npersonnel material in nature and type,” as described in Penal Code sections 832.5 and\n832.6, and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.\n       The Slaughter parties argue that the public has a strong interest in the Report’s\ncriticisms of the PPD’s handling and administrative investigation of the McDade\nincident, particularly as to lessons it contains to prevent similar incidents. They also\nmaintain that, to the extent the order redacting certain material in the Report is legally\ndefensible, the court was overly protective of the officers’ privacy and improperly treated\npublicly available material (the officers’ testimony in the federal court action) and\ncriticisms of the PPD’s administrative investigation as confidential personnel\ninformation. The Slaughter parties also contend that petitioners waived their right to\nassert privilege by virtue of petitioners’ counsel’s disclosure of excerpts of the Report in\nthe March 16 Reply brief filed in this proceeding.\n       The City contends the trial court got it right, and the petition must be denied.\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f       The Times insists that the petition be denied and the Report disclosed in its\nentirety. They assert that the Pitchess statutes protect only enumerated categories of\nconfidential material not at issue here, and that petitioners’ asserted secrecy interests do\nnot clearly outweigh the significant public interest in full disclosure. The Times also\nargues that, because information used by OIR to prepare its Report was voluntarily and\npublicly disclosed, any right the City or officers may have had to assert confidentiality as\nto that information was waived.\n       We conclude that, in large measure, the trial court’s well-reasoned decision is\ncorrect. The Report is a public document that contains some privileged personnel\ninformation statutorily exempt from disclosure, and no privileges have been waived.\nHowever, we also find that the trial court’s redactions go too far to the extent they\nprevent disclosure of OIR analyses of the PPD’s administrative review and investigation,\nwhich are not criticisms or appraisals directed at officer conduct.\n1.     The PRA\n       The Legislature enacted the PRA in 1968 to clarify the scope of the public’s right\nto inspect records. (County of Los Angeles v.

In furtherance of this goal, the Supreme Court has declared that\n“[m]aximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations” is necessary. (CBS,\nInc. v. Block, at pp. 651–652.) As the result of a voter initiative passed in 2004, the\nPRA’s principles are now enshrined in the state Constitution: “The people have the right\nof access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business, and,\n\n                                             12\n\ftherefore, . . . the writings of public . . . agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.”12\n(Cal.

The California Supreme Court has found this\npolicy especially salient when the subject is law enforcement: “‘In order to maintain trust\nin its police department, the public must be kept fully informed of the activities of its\npeace officers.’” (Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v.

Given the\nextraordinary authority with which they are entrusted, the need for transparency,\naccountability and public access to information is particularly acute when the information\nsought involves the conduct of police officers. In CPOST, the Supreme Court observed,\n“The public’s legitimate interest in the identity and activities of police officers is even\ngreater than its interest in those of the average public servant. ‘Law enforcement officers\ncarry upon their shoulders the cloak of authority to enforce the laws of the state. In order\nto maintain trust in its police department, the public must be kept fully informed of the\nactivities of its peace officers.’ [Citation.] ‘It is indisputable that law enforcement is a\nprimary function of local government and that the public has a far greater interest in the\nqualifications and conduct of law enforcement officers, even at, and perhaps especially\nat, an “on the street” level than in the qualifications and conduct of other comparably\n\n       12   The Report was written for and on behalf of the City, a public agency.\n\n                                               13\n\flow-ranking government employees performing more proprietary functions.

Under the PRA the public has a\nright to inspect public records unless an exception applies. (§ 6253, subds. (a), (b).) In\nadopting the PRA, the Legislature remained “mindful of the right of individuals to\nprivacy” (§ 6250), and enumerated several exceptions to disclosure designed to protect\nindividual privacy rights that outweigh the public’s interest in disclosure. (§ 6254; see\nLAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 238–239.) The California Constitution\nacknowledges that police officers are entitled to certain privacy protections. Article I,\nsection 3, subdivision (b)(3) provides that nothing in that subdivision “‘supersedes or\nmodifies the right of privacy guaranteed by [article 1,] Section 1 or affects the\nconstruction of any statute . . . to the extent that it protects that right to privacy, including\nany statutory procedures governing discovery or disclosure of information concerning the\nofficial performance or professional qualifications of a peace officer.’” (CPOST, supra,\n\n                                               14\n\f42 Cal.4th at p. 288.) The Constitution thus “excludes from the requirement of narrow\nconstruction those statutes . . . protect[ing] the privacy interests of peace officers,\nincluding [the PRA] and the Pitchess statutes . . . at issue here.

A party opposing disclosure must show the requested\ninformation falls within the parameters of a specific exemption.

(a) [“The agency shall\njustify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt\nunder express provisions of this chapter”].)\n         We are concerned here with one exception to the PRA. That exception protects\nfrom disclosure “[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to\nfederal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code\nrelating to privilege.” (§ 6254, subd. (k).) This provision incorporates the Pitchess\nprotections that render personnel records of peace officers confidential. (Pen. Code,\n§ 832.7, subd. (a); City of Richmond v. Superior Court (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Pitchess protections\n         The law governing protection for the privacy of police officers in California is\nfound in a series of statutes commonly referred to as “Pitchess statutes,” specifically\nPenal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8 and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.\n(Warrick v. Superior Court (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518465\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518465/warrick-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1019.) In enacting the Pitchess\nstatutes, the Legislature made policy choices, deciding which information should be\npublic and which information should be exempt from disclosure, and “drew the line\ncarefully, with due concern for the competing interests.” (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 298.) The Pitchess statutes provide for two categories of confidential records:\n(1) “personnel records,” and (2) records of citizen complaints about individual officers,\nand reports or findings relating to investigation of such complaints. (LBPOA, supra, 59\nCal.4th at pp. 68–69; Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (a).)\n\n                                               15\n\f         As employed in the Pitchess statutes, the term “personnel records” refers to any\nfile maintained under an individual’s name by his or her employing agency and\ncontaining records related to “[e]mployee advancement, appraisal, or discipline,”\n“[c]omplaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in\nwhich he or she participated, or which he or she perceived, and pertaining to the manner\nin which he or she performed his or her duties,” and “[a]ny other information the\ndisclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n(Pen. Code, § 832.8, subds. (d)–(f).) The disclosure of peace officer personnel records is\nlimited by Penal Code section 832.7, which provides that such records (or information\nobtained from such records), are confidential and may be disclosed in litigation only\nunder specified procedures on a showing of good cause. (See Evid. Code, §§ 1043,\n1045.)\n         Also protected as confidential are an ageny’s investigations of citizen complaints.\n“Under the Pitchess statutes, a public entity that employs peace officers must investigate\nand retain citizen complaints of officer misconduct, such as the use of excessive force.\n(Pen. Code, § 832.5.) Litigants, upon a showing of good cause, are given limited access\nto records of such complaints and investigations (Evid. Code, §§ 1043, 1045), but such\nrecords are otherwise ‘confidential’ and may ‘not be disclosed’ (Pen. Code, §§ 832.7,\nsubd. (a), 832.8, subd. (e)).” (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 68.) The Pitchess statutes\nrequire police departments to “establish a procedure to investigate complaints by\nmembers of the public against the personnel of these departments . . . .” (Pen. Code,\n§ 832.5, subd. (a)(1).) But Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (e) protects\n“[c]omplaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in\nwhich [an officer] participated . . . and pertaining to the manner in which he or she\nperformed his or her duties.”\n         c.

The appellate court\nordered the records disclosed, reasoning that Penal Code section 832.7’s confidentiality\nprovision for “personnel records” applied only to files maintained by the employing\nagency, not information developed from other sources, even if that independently\ndeveloped information duplicated information in the personnel file. (Id. at pp. 1280–\n1281.) Because the civil service commission was not the deputy’s employing agency, the\ncourt of appeal found its records did not qualify as “‘personnel records’” protected by the\nPitchess statutes. (Copley Press, at pp. 1280–1281, 1286–1287.)\n       The Supreme Court rejected this interpretation, concluding that officers’\ndisciplinary records are privileged even where those records are generated by an outside\nagency. The court found the civil service commission records of the deputy’s appeal\nconstituted confidential “‘personnel records,’” exempt from disclosure under the Pitchess\nstatutes. (Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 1286–1296.) There is nothing in the\nlanguage or legislative history of the Pitchess statutes to suggest that a police officer’s\nprivacy rights are entitled to less protection because his or her employer uses an outside\nagency to conduct administrative appeals. (Copley Press, at p. 1295.) Copley Press also\nrejected the appellate court’s conclusion that disclosure of the identity of the appealing\ndeputy was required, noting the Pitchess statutes were “designed to protect, among other\nthings, ‘the identity of officers’ subject to [citizen] complaints.” (Copley Press, at\np. 1297, citing Pen. Code, § 832.7, subds. (a), (c).) Penal Code section 832.7 deems an\nofficer’s personnel records and information obtained from those records “confidential.”\nAccordingly, they are exempt from disclosure under the PRA. (Id. at pp. 1284–1286.)\n       In CPOST, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a newspaper was denied access to information\ncontained in a database that set minimum selection and training standards for peace\n\n                                              17\n\fofficers. The database—which included employment data on all peace officers appointed\nin California beginning in the 1970’s—was compiled from information provided by local\nlaw enforcement agencies and obtained from officers’ personnel records, and maintained\nby a public agency that did not employ the officers. (Id. at pp. 285–286.) The trial court\nordered the information (officers’ names, appointing agencies, and dates of appointment\nand termination) disclosed. The appellate court reversed. (Id. at p. 303.)\n       The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeal, found the information was not\nexempt under the Pitchess statutes, and ordered it disclosed. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th\nat pp. 298–303.) A majority of the court found, however, that information in the database\nwould be exempt from disclosure if it had been “obtained from” personnel records\nmaintained by the officers’ employing agencies. (Id. at p. 289.) Notably, the court also\nheld that information does not become confidential for purposes of the Pitchess statutes\nmerely because it is derived from a personnel file that also contains confidential\ninformation. (CPOST, at p. 289.) “[P]eace officer personnel records include only the\ntypes of information enumerated in [Penal Code] section 832.8.” (Id. at p. 293.) Because\nthe officers’ names and requested employment information were not within any\nenumerated category, that information must be disclosed. (Id. at pp. 294–299.)\n       In CPOST, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court stressed that its decision in Copley\nPress, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633606/copley-press-inc-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> was expressly “qualified,” and limited to the specific\nlinking of an officer with a disciplinary hearing. (CPOST, at p. 298.) Relying on the\nstatutory language, the court narrowly construed the term “‘personal data’” as precluding\ndisclosure of sensitive information such as marital status, home address and officer\ndiscipline. (Id. at pp. 294–295.) It refused to expand the exemption, explaining that,\n“[w]ithout a more specific indication in the statute, we hesitate to conclude that the\nLegislature intended to classify the identity of a public official whose activities are a\nmatter of serious public concern as ‘personal data.’” (Id. at p. 296.)\n       Most recently, in LBPOA, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court addressed a PRA request\nfor the identities of officers involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man, as well as\n\n                                              18\n\fshootings that resulted in serious injury or death within a six-year period. (Id. at p. 71.)\nThe city and police officers resisted disclosure, arguing the information was covered by\nthe Pitchess statutes’ confidentiality protections for personnel records (Pen. Code,\n§§ 832.7, 832.8). (LBPOA, at p. 71.)\n       The California Supreme Court was not persuaded. It reaffirmed the mandate that\ncourts must adhere to limits drawn by the Legislature in the Pitchess statutes. (LBPOA,\nsupra, 59 Ca1.4th at p. 72.) Officers’ names are protected under the Pitchess statutes\nonly if linked to information in personnel records. (LBPOA, at p. 71, citing CPOST,\nsupra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 295.) Only “records generated in connection with . . . appraisal or\ndiscipline would come within the statutory definition of personnel records,” under Penal\nCode section 832.8. (LBPOA, at p. 71.) The court again refused to “read the phrase\n‘records relating to . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . [e]mployee . . . appraisal[] or discipline’ [citation]\nso broadly as to include every record that might be considered for purposes of an\nofficer’s appraisal or discipline, for such a broad reading of the statute would sweep\nvirtually all law enforcement records into the protected category of ‘personnel records.”’\n(Id. at pp. 71–72.) Only records that themselves reflect “‘advancement, appraisal or\ndiscipline’” fall within the scope of the Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d)\nexemption.

As succinctly summed up by the trial court, it is now established that\n“disciplinary records of peace officers are protected by privilege under the Pitchess\nstatutes no matter where those records are generated. . . . Information which is not itself\na personnel record is nevertheless protected if it was obtained from a peace officer’s\npersonnel record. . . . Only records generated in connection with an administrative\nappraisal or discipline qualify as Pitchess protected personnel records; records generated\nas part of an internal or administrative investigation of the officer generally are\nconfidential, but other records about an incident are not.”\n\n                                                  19\n\f4.     Portions of the Report are exempt from disclosure under the Act\n       There can be no legitimate dispute that the Report is a public record. The term\n“public records” is broad, and includes “any writing containing information relating to\nthe conduct of the public’s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or\nlocal agency.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).) The records here (the Report) are retained by the\nCity, a local agency, and relate to the public’s business because the City commissioned\nOIR to review and evaluate the PPD’s response in a case involving use of lethal force.\n(Cf. CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 288.) The information and analysis contained in the\nReport is precisely the sort the disclosure of which will promote public scrutiny of and\nagency accountability for specific uses of deadly force. Further, as the trial court aptly\nobserved, the Report “is aimed at the administration of the [PPD] as a whole, not the\nindividual Officers, with the goal of determining what lessons can be gleaned from the\nMcDade incident and its aftermath, and recommending institutional reforms for the\nfuture.”\n       The real issue is whether the Report is subject to an exemption. The mere fact that\nthe Report contains privileged information does not bestow protected status on the entire\ndocument. Police officer personnel records include only the type of information\nspecified in Penal Code section 832.8. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293.) Only\nrecords generated in connection with a citizen complaint, or administrative appraisal or\ndiscipline, are protected. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.)\n       a.     The Report was not prepared in response to a citizen complaint\n       Petitioners argue the Report falls within the ambit of Penal Code section 832.8,\nsubdivision (e) because the trial court found it was prepared in response to a March 25,\n2012 citizen complaint regarding the McDade shooting and contains the conclusions of\nthe OIR group, which investigated the complaint regarding the shooting. Petitioners\noverstate the record. The evidence does not clearly reflect that OIR’s retention or Report\nwas precipitated by a citizen complaint. Rather, it shows only that at an unspecified point\nafter the March 24, 2012 incident, the City “hired . . . OIR Group . . . to review the\n\n                                             20\n\fMcDade shooting incident.” The City’s return is silent as to whether the Report was\nprepared in response to a citizen complaint. However, the unchallenged declaration of\nDeputy Chief Qualls indicates OIR was not retained for that purpose. Rather, OIR was\ntasked with conducting an assessment and preparing a Report to “review . . . the incident\nfor the benefit of the department and to evaluate how the department does business in the\nareas reviewed.” The record also reflects that the PPD itself investigated the citizen\ncomplaint in the course of its CID and IA investigations.\n       b.     Portions of the Report are related to the administrative investigation of the\nofficers and are therefore exempt from disclosure.\n       The PPD commissioned OIR to prepare the Report for two related, broad\npurposes; (1) to analyze the McDade shooting and its aftermath for the purpose of\ndetermining what lessons could be learned from the incident; and (2) to recommend\ninstitutional reforms. There is no indication it was intended to be used in connection with\nperformance appraisals, or the advancement or discipline of the officers, and the PPD has\nexpressly affirmed that the Report will not be considered in future employment decisions\ninvolving those officers. Although the McDade shooting was the catalyst for the Report\nand provided the lens through which OIR focused its evaluation, the Report looks beyond\nthe conduct of the individual officers. It presents an overview of the PPD’s criminal and\nadministrative investigations into the shooting, evaluates the manner in which the PPD’s\nprocedures and practices may have fallen short, and recommends institutional\nimprovements. Any analyses in the Report are aimed at the PPD’s training, tactics and\nreview process in the wake of the McDade shooting, not the individual officers, even\nthough those analyses use the actions of the officers as a springboard to assess the\nagency’s conduct.\n       Petitioners have the burden to prove the Report is exempt from disclosure under\nsection 6254, subdivision (k) by virtue of the Pitchess statutes. In a situation involving\nan officer’s use of lethal force against an unarmed suspect, the public’s interest in\ndisclosure is “particularly great,” because such incidents raise serious questions about\n\n                                             21\n\fgovernmental policies regarding law enforcement and public safety. (LBPOA, supra, 59\nCal.4th at p. 74.) Nevertheless, in enacting the Pitchess statutes, the Legislature made a\npolicy determination that the desirability for confidentiality in police personnel matters\noutweighs the public’s interest in openness. (Copley Press, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 1298.)\n       As the trial court correctly found, the Report contains privileged information. The\nprotection for personnel records under section 6254, subdivision (k) applies to any\ninformation obtained from an officer’s personnel records. (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 289.) Accordingly, portions of the Report culled from personnel information or\nofficers’ statements made in the course of the PPD’s administrative investigation of the\nMcDade shooting are protected by the Pitchess statutes. However, other portions of the\nReport, including the CID investigation, which do not constitute or relate to employee\nappraisal, are not. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.)\n       c.     Nonprivileged portions of the Report are not so intertwined with privileged\nportions as to render the entire Report exempt from disclosure\n       Implicitly conceding that information from the criminal investigation must be\ndisclosed, petitioners argue that information in the Report gleaned from the CID and\nadministrative investigations is inextricably intertwined because the PPD relied heavily\non the CID investigation to conduct its administrative review, and OIR had access to all\nthe PPD’s investigative materials.

The commission was a standing body that received written citizen\ncomplaints, investigated the allegations and held public hearings on the complaints at\n\n                                             22\n\fwhich the officer was required to provide information. The commission then announced\nits findings on the allegations. (Id. at p. 391.) The court found that the commission\nproceedings “fit the description of [a] [Penal Code] section 832.5” proceeding, and its\npractice of holding public hearings on citizen complaints violated Penal Code section\n832.7, subdivision (a), by disclosing confidential police officer personnel information.\n(Id. at pp. 402, 404–405.)\n       In Davis, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260912/davis-v-city-of-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court enjoined a city from releasing a\nreport about a shooting prepared by a permanent citizens’ review board established to\nreview citizen complaints, because the report was derived almost entirely from records\nrelating to a complaint. The report, compiled from personnel records, was itself a\npersonnel record. (Id. at p. 900.)\n       Here the trial court properly rejected petitioners’ factually unsupported contention\nthat information regarding the administrative investigation is inextricably intertwined\nwith the criminal investigation so as to render the entire Report exempt. Material from\nthe criminal investigation was generated independently and in advance of the\nadministrative investigation. Officers’ personnel records include only the type of\ninformation enumerated in Penal Code section 832.8 (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at\np. 293), and only records generated in connection with an administrative appraisal or\ndiscipline are protected. (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 71.) The City acknowledges,\nand the trial court found, that information obtained from the administrative investigation\ncan be separated from information derived from other sources. That factual\ndetermination finds substantial evidentiary support.\n       Where, as here, nonexempt materials are not inextricably intertwined with exempt\nmaterials and are reasonably separable, segregation is required. (See § 6253, subd. (a)\n[“Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection by any\nperson requesting the record after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law”];\nCBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653 [“The fact that parts of a requested\ndocument fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire\n\n                                            23\n\fdocument”].) As proponents of nondisclosure, petitioners bear the “‘burden of\nproof . . . of . . . demonstrat[ing] a “clear overbalance” on the side of confidentiality.’”\n(CBS Broadcasting, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 908.) “[M]ere\nassertion[s]” and conjecture will not suffice. (CBS, Inc. v. Block, at pp. 652–653.)\nPetitioners have not met their burden.\n       Furthermore, as the trial court observed, the City would face significant problems\nif its criminal and administrative investigations were not independent. The criminal\ninvestigation was conducted solely “to determine whether a crime occurred. It [wa]s not\nconducted for the purpose of an appraisal of officers, for the consideration of\ndiscipline . . . .” Information obtained during the criminal investigation is not\nadministrative information protected by the Pitchess statutes. Records related to the\ncriminal investigation are not personnel records, and do not reveal information regarding\n“advancement, appraisal, or discipline” of a particular officer. Only the PPD’s\nadministrative review results in a disciplinary recommendation to the Chief. And, only\nrecords related to that process enjoy protection under the Pitchess statutes.\n       d.     The PRA does not exempt any record that theoretically could be used in\npersonnel decisions\n       Seeking to expand the PRA’s reach, petitioners invite us to find that in addition to\nrecords generated in connection with “advancement, appraisal, or discipline,” Penal Code\nsection 832.8, subdivision (d) should be read to encompass records—like the entire\nReport—that contain information that “could be used” for such purposes. We may not\nand would not do so. Appellate courts “‘do not sit as super-legislatures to determine the\nwisdom, desirability or propriety of statutes enacted by the Legislature.’ [Citation.] The\nrewriting of a statute is a legislative, rather than a judicial function, a practice in which\nwe will not engage.” (California State University Fresno Assn., Inc. v.

(CPOST, supra, 42\nCal.4th at p. 293.) Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d) cannot be read so broadly\nas to include an entire third-party report regarding the PPD’s practice in addressing the\naftermath of a fatal shooting. Only a small portion of the Report relates to officer\n“advancement, appraisal, or discipline.” Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion that the overarching purpose of the Report is not related to officer appraisal or\ndiscipline. Further, based on the sworn declaration of Deputy Chief Qualls, the PPD\nwould be barred from considering the Report in future employment-related decisions\nregarding these officers. Petitioners dismiss this unequivocal and unchallenged evidence\nas “speculation,” offering their own speculation that the City could use the Report in a\nfuture review of the officers. Petitioners’ argument ignores the express limitations\ncontained in Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (d), and the Supreme Court’s mandate\nin CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293, and would extend the statute beyond its limited\npurpose.\n5.     PRA privilege has not been waived\n       a.     The privilege was not waived when the officers placed personnel\ninformation in the public domain.\n       Interveners argue that petitioners cannot establish that they will suffer harm if the\nReport is publicly disclosed because the officers waived any right of confidentiality as to\ninformation in the public domain, information the officers themselves voluntarily\nreleased. Accordingly, to the extent redactions ordered by the trial court—even those\nwhich recite to or rely on the administrative investigation, and thus would otherwise be\nprivileged—include information in the public domain, Interveners maintain the officers\nwaived any exemption to disclosure under the PRA. We disagree.\n       In connection with a summary judgment motion in Slaughter’s federal action, the\nofficers filed with the court excerpts from their own deposition transcripts, among others.\nThose transcripts contain testimony by the officers about their recollections of the\n\n                                             25\n\fMcDade shooting, and their conduct, concerns and strategies. Transcripts of others’\ndepositions, such as PPD Chief Sanchez, reveal information about officer training and a\nprior OIR report regarding a 2009 officer involved shooting. The transcripts also reflect\nthat the officers used statements they voluntarily gave in the course of the CID\ninvestigation to refresh their recollections at deposition, thereby waiving protection for\nthose statements in that litigation. (Evid. Code, § 771, subds (a), (b).)13 The officers’\ndeposition testimony was given voluntarily, none of the transcripts was filed under seal\nand the officers chose not to shield their testimony or submissions or to seek a protective\norder.14 “‘Court records are public records, available to the public in general.’” (Hurvitz\nv.

(Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (a).) (Id. at pp. 610, 615–616.) Upon receipt of a\nPRA request, the district attorney sought publicly to release the results, arguing they lost\ntheir confidential status once obtained by his office. (Id. at pp. 610, 617.) The appellate\ncourt rejected the argument concluding that Pitchess protections are not lost for\ninformation obtained from an officer’s personnel file just because that information is\ndisclosed in a criminal or civil action. (Fagan, at p. 617.)\n\n                                              26\n\frecords may also be found in an unprotected source does not impact the confidentiality of\nthe personnel records themselves. The “Pitchess statutes create a privilege for all\ninformation in peace officers’ personnel files without regard to information found\nelsewhere.” (Hackett v.

This is true even where, as here, the officers themselves placed the information\nin the public domain.\n       Absent an express waiver of the privilege with respect to the confidential,\npersonnel information found in the Report, the officers retain Pitchess protections as to\nthat information, even if the information is the same as or similar to information available\nelsewhere in the public domain. (See CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 296, fn. 5 [“We do\nnot suggest that the mere fact that officers’ names are available from other sources\nnecessarily means that the information cannot be considered personal or private”]; United\nStates DOD v.

The trial court correctly concluded that redaction was in order for\nthose portions of the Report that contain advancement, appraisal, or discipline\ninformation, or were derived from the administrative record.\n       b.     The privilege was not waived when the City gave the Report to petitioners\n       Nor did waiver occur by virtue of the City’s provision of the Report to petitioners.\nGenerally speaking, once disclosed to a member of the public, a record becomes\navailable for public inspection. (Black Panther Party v. Kehoe (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">645</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656–657, § 6254.5.) But waiver occurs only if the agency discloses a document to a\n“member of the public.” (§ 6254.5.) The statutory privilege of confidentiality in\nofficers’ personnel records is held both by the City and the officers. (City of Hemet v.\n\n                                            27\n\fSuperior Court (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(§ 3306.5.)\nThey cannot be denied access to their own personnel records for fear that permitting\naccess will waive confidentiality. It was not improper for the City to share the Report in\nconfidence with petitioners, and no waiver may be implied therefrom.\n       c.     No waiver by public disclosure of redacted material on appeal\n       As noted above, petitioners publicly filed a Reply brief containing verbatim\nexcerpts of the Report, i.e., significant portions of the very material they contend is\nconfidential. The Slaughter parties insist that such disclosure constitutes “changed\ncircumstances” which operate to waive any privilege that may arguably have attached to\nthe disclosed material. We disagree.\n       Just as petitioners’ public disclosure of their deposition testimony in Slaughter’s\nfederal action against them did not operate to waive their right of confidentiality as to\nprotected personnel records, their disclosure in this proceeding of excerpts from the\nReport does not operate as a waiver of their right to confidentiality. As explained by the\ntrial court, “[i]nformation obtained from a police officer’s personnel record is protected.”\n(See CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 289.) In CPOST, the Supreme Court held that an\nofficer could not waive the privilege as to such information without expressly doing so.\nNo express waiver occurred here. To paraphrase CPOST, “the mere fact that [privileged\npersonnel information is] available from other sources [does not] necessarily mean[] that\nthe information cannot be considered personal or private.” (Id. at p. 296, fn. 5; see\nDepartment of Defense v. FLRA, supra, 510 U.S. at p. 500 [individual’s privacy interest\nin controlling dissemination of information regarding personal matters “does not dissolve\nsimply because that information may be available to the public in some form”].)16\n\n\n       16  We agree with petitioners that questionable police shootings and recent unrest\nthroughout the country does not bear on the issue of petitioners’ right to confidentiality as\nto portions of the Report. As profoundly troubling as these events are and have been, and\nas significant as the public interest is in the complex and nuanced debate surrounding\n\n                                             28\n\f6.     The trial court applied the PRA exemption too broadly\n       Our review of the Report reveals the trial court’s redactions are overbroad.\nInformation properly classified as personnel records must be redacted from the Report.\nThe remainder, however, including analyses of the PPD’s response to and handling of the\ninvestigation of the McDade shooting, and OIR’s recommendations for institutional\nreform, must be disclosed publicly. “The fact that parts of a requested document fall\nwithin the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire document.”\n(CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653; § 6253, subd. (a) [“[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection . . . after deletion of the\nportions that are exempted by law”].)\n       Petitioners, of course, argue that not enough information was redacted from the\nReport. Interveners, who chose not to seek review under section 6259, argue that too\nmuch information was redacted. We invited and have considered the parties’ arguments\non the question of the scope of this court’s authority to grant relief not sought in the only\npetition before us. We conclude that this court has the authority to determine whether the\ntrial court erred in ordering the current breadth of redactions from the Report, a\ndetermination which encompasses within its scope both the issue of whether the trial\ncourt redacted too little (petitioners’ position) or too much (Interveners’ position).\n       We conclude that the issue of the appropriate extent of redactions is encompassed\nwithin the scope of the challenged judgment. Because the Report has remained sealed\nthroughout this litigation, Interveners have no way to ascertain that too much information\n\n\n\npolice use of force and allegations of institutional racism, those issues do not bear\ndirectly on the circumstances at issue here. Such events (which occurred outside of\nPasadena) and concerns do not negate the statutory Pitchess protections as they apply to\nthe officers. (Pen. Code, §§ 832.7, 832.8.) For this reason––and for the independent\nreason that we have no need to consult the PRA’s Legislative history––we deny the\nTimes’ request for judicial notice (See Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2305660\"><a href=\"/opinion/2305660/deveny-v-entropin-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because the trial court articulated the correct legal standard,\nthey may reasonably have concluded there was no basis upon which to seek review.\nPrinciples of equity and those outlined in Code of Civil Procedure section 906 require\nthat the court’s redaction order be modified even though the grounds justifying that\nmodification were not raised by petitioners and Interveners did not file their own cross-\npetitions. Specifically, that statute provides that “the reviewing court may review . . . any\nintermediate ruling, proceeding, order or decision which involves the merits or\nnecessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the\nrights of a party . . . , and may affirm, reverse or modify any judgment or order appealed\nfrom and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered . . . .” The Legislature\nhas recognized the inherent authority of courts to manage their proceedings and adopt\nsuitable methods of practice. Every court has the power “[t]o amend and control its\nprocess and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 128, subd. (a)(8); see Code Civ. Proc., § 187 [“When jurisdiction is, by the\nConstitution . . . or by any . . . statute, conferred on a Court . . ., all the means necessary\nto carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course\nof proceeding be not specifically pointed out by . . . statute, any suitable process or mode\nof proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this\nCode”].)\n       “It is also well established that[, independent of any statutory authority,] courts\nhave fundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and administrative powers, as well as\ninherent power to control litigation before them.” (Rutherford v.

This contention is meritless. The City has had (and has taken) the\nopportunity to address the propriety of redacting portions of the Report, both here and\nbefore the trial court. Indeed, it urges us to find that the trial court’s redactions\nappropriately protect the officers. Further, the City has been on notice since before it\nfiled its Return that Interveners would urge this court to conclude that the Report was\nover redacted.\n       The question of whether the trial court erred regarding the extent of its redactions\nis a question of law, fully briefed and embraced within the challenged order. Petitioners\nopened the door to this issue by filing a writ petition challenging the scope of the court’s\nredactions. They have invited this court to review the challenged order in its entirety and\nto scrutinize specific redactions made by the trial court. We conclude that the principles\nembraced by Code of Civil Procedure sections 906, 128 and 187, considered in light of\nthe PRA’s goal to accelerate appellate review, not limit its scope (Times Mirror Co. v.\nSuperior Court (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403959/times-mirror-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1334), militate in favor of a determination that the\ntrial court failed to adhere to the rule it correctly articulated, and an order directing the\ncourt to release additional nonprivileged portions of the Report.\n       Information not obtained from findings of an internal or administrative\ninvestigation of the officers, or the privileged personnel records of any officer, is not\nshielded from disclosure. The Pitchess statutes do not exempt “every record that might\nbe considered for purposes of an officer’s appraisal.” (LBPOA, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 72; accord, CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 293 [Pitchess statutes do not exempt\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\finformation “merely because [it] is contained in a file that also includes the type of\nconfidential information specified in” Pen. Code, §§ 832.5–832.8].)\n       “Appraisal,” as that term is employed in the Pitchess statutes, does not encompass\nreview of an agency’s practices and procedures. “The people have the right of access to\ninformation concerning the conduct of the people’s business,” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3,\nsubd. (b)), and their right of access must be “broadly construed.” The public’s interest in\ndisclosure is “particularly great” where, as here, the underlying case involves an officer\ninvolved shootings and policies regarding public safety and law enforcement. (LBPOA,\nsupra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 74.) No Pitchess protections statutes attach to material in the\nReport derived primarily from non-confidential records not intended to be part of the\nofficers’ personnel matters or to be used in connection with officer advancement,\nappraisal or disciplinary proceedings. A number of redactions proposed by the City and\nlargely adopted by the trial court protected not privileged information relating to the\nofficers, but information or findings critiquing conduct by or the policies and practice of\nthe PPD itself. Any redaction of such material subverts the public’s right to “‘be kept\nfully informed of the activities of its peace officers’” “‘[i]n order to maintain trust in its\npolice department[].’” (CPOST, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 297.)\n       Appendix A to this decision, filed under seal, contains a nonexhaustive list of\nmaterial in the Report erroneously redacted by the trial court. On remand, the trial court,\nafter revisiting the Report and bearing the principles articulated in this opinion in mind,\nmay conclude that additional information must also publically be released. Accordingly,\nwe will deny the petition and remand the matter to the superior court with directions to\nconduct the additional proceedings it deems appropriate and issue a new or modified\njudgment ordering additional redactions in accordance with this opinion. When that\njudgment issues, appendix A shall be immediately unsealed.17\n\n\n       17\n       In connection with proceedings on remand, we note the following: On\nNovember 4, 2014, the trial court ordered the City to lodge two documents under seal:\n\n                                               32\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The petition is denied.
