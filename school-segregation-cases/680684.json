L. Ramsey, Circuit Court Clerk and Registrar, Clarke County, Mississippi, and the State of Mississippi, under the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and 1960 (42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 et seq.). The complaint alleges that defendants, in conducting registration for voting, have engaged in certain racially discriminatory acts and practices which deprived Negro citizens of Clarke County of the right to register to vote; that these deprivations were pursuant to a pattern and practice, and that unless restrained, defendants will continue to engage in such acts and practices. The prayer is for:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. A finding of a pattern and practice and the issuance of an injunction ordering defendants to refrain from:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Engaging in any act which would deprive any citizen in Clarke County of the right to vote on account of his race or color;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Engaging in any act which would delay, prevent, hinder or discourage qualified Negro citizens, on account of their race or color, from applying for, and becoming, registered voters;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Failing to register any Negro applicant who possesses the same or similar qualifications of the least qualified white person who has been registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a long, hard, and well fought trial, the District Court made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered its decree, which:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Dismissed the complaint against Mississippi;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Found that Negro citizens had been discriminated against by the Registrar, but that this discrimination did not form a pattern or practice of discrimination within the meaning and contemplation of 42 U.S.C.A. 1971(e); 3. Granted to the United States injunctive relief against the County Registrar, A. L. Ramsey, enjoining and restraining him from engaging in any act or practices which would deprive any citizen in Clarke County of the right to vote on account of his race or color. The injunction was detailed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is fair and accurate to say that in substance what the District Court ordered was full and non-discriminatory compliance with the law of Mississippi. No finding of any unconstitutionality of any Mississippi constitutional or statutory provision is sought by the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, the United States appealed, assigning three specific errors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The District Court erred in dismissing the amended complaint as to the State of Mississippi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The District Court erred in refusing to find that the discrimination found to have been committed constituted a pattern or practice of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The District Court erred in not granting the complete relief sought by appellant as outlined in appellant's proposed decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial error assigned is the District Court's dismissal of the State of Mississippi as a party. Under our holding in United States v. Atkins, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 733, 739, we do not think that it was improper to eliminate the State as a party. There, we referred to 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(c), as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1960, &#167; 601(b), and to the case of United States v. Alabama, 1960, 362 U.S. 602, 80 S.Ct. 924, 4 L. E.2d 982, and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In that case, the Supreme Court intimated no views upon `any defenses, constitutional or otherwise, that may be asserted by the State.' We follow the same course in the present case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as full and complete relief can be afforded here without enjoining the State, we hold that the court below was correct in its dismissal of the State as a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some discussion was had between the parties in the argument of this case concerning the application of the freezing principle. As shown in the Atkins decision, this Court has had the principle under discussion, but has not been faced with a case which required a decision on the subject. Under the facts here, we think that adequate and proper relief is provided by the judgment of the court below, as hereinafter modified, and we pretermit further discussion of the principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the same is true of the appellant's contention with respect to pattern and practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant vigorously challenges the finding of discrimination. In the face of testimony which witness by witness convicts Ramsey of palpable discrimination, the District Court was certainly correct in its finding of discrimination. The Government argues strenuously that the lower court erred in not finding a pattern of discrimination. Assuming that the District Judge would have been justified in finding the existence of a \"pattern or practice of discrimination,\" we pretermit any definitive action on this facet of the case because we feel it was within the District Judge's discretion to omit action on that phase of the complaint (United States v. Raines, D.C., 203 F.Supp. 147 (1961)). It is apparent to us that the District Judge has obviously made an intelligent and sincere effort to guarantee to all persons in Clarke County, regardless of race, a full opportunity to register and vote without discrimination. He has granted a sweeping injunction against discrimination. The relief granted appears to be carefully designed to provide to Negro citizens of Clarke County the greatest protection and safeguard of their right to register and vote, while maintaining, as far as is consistent with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, the delicate balance between State and Federal relations. Registration is a State function; it can best be carried out by the appropriate State officials. But, if one man's rights are denied, the rights of all are endangered. In our country the courts have a most important obligation to protect the rights of all and to do it as harmoniously as possible. In his endeavor to do just this, the District Judge obviously thought it best not to make a specific finding that there was a \"pattern.\" We do not believe that by the language of subsection (e) of 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 the Congress of the United States intended to impose upon the district courts the mandatory duty of making a finding as to whether a previously found deprivation of rights or privileges was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice, regardless of the District Court's opinion as to the necessity or non-necessity of making such a finding. A federal district court is a court of equity, and as such has broad powers of discretion. Judge Cox heard the evidence; he knows the circumstances; he is the appropriate person to decide what orders are proper and necessary. Discretion is a fundamental attribute of equity. \"Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.\" This language is quoted from the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083. What the Supreme Court said there dealing with the question of segregation in the public schools is equally applicable here. And cf. United States v. Raines, D.C., 203 F.Supp. 147, citing Hecht Company v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the last few days, the Supreme Court has granted its specific approval to the choice by the District Judge of the remedy he will select in carrying out his injunctive order. The District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi had<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> declared the rights of the Negro plaintiffs, but declined to issue an injunction, using in part this language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"I am further of the opinion that during this period of turmoil the time now has arrived when the judiciary should not issue injunctions perfunctorily, but should place trust in men of high character that they will obey the mandate of the Court without an injunction hanging over their heads. Neither the facts in the present case nor the exigencies of the situation are sufficient or urgent enough to require the granting of an injunction.\" (206 F.Supp. page 543).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the action of the District Court, 313 F.2d 637. The Supreme Court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> denied certiorari, thus leaving in effect this Court's holding that the discretion of the District Court was correctly used in declaring the rights of the plaintiffs, but declining to issue an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So here, the District Court has granted substantial relief to the plaintiffs, and the relief so granted was, in his opinion, sufficient under the circumstances to guarantee to all persons in Clarke County, regardless of race or color, a full opportunity to register and vote without discrimination. Both the State's rights and the rights of the United States were safeguarded. The rightful authority of the United States was vindicated and the District Judge, familiar with the facts, selected the method of enforcement which he thought was most appropriate. If good faith non-discriminatory registration is not provided, the remedy will be to reopen the case so that the District Judge may grant whatever further relief the facts may justify. The case will remain on the docket of the District Court and that Court will retain jurisdiction of the entire matter for the purpose of making any and all additional findings and conclusions and of entering any and all additional orders as may, in his opinion, be necessary or appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN NOT GRANTING THE COMPLETE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Registration is a prerequisite to voting in Mississippi. Registration is permanent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The United States asks that we reverse the District Judge and order him to enter a mandate setting forth certain specific requirements to enable a man to register in Mississippi; then the Government requests that the mandate be amplified by spelling out for the Registrar just what standards he must apply. Admittedly, this would force the Registrar to violate the law of his State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Mississippi law (Mississippi Code, &#167;&#167; 3113 and 3239) the Commissioners of election of each county have the duty to erase the names of all persons erroneously registered. These commissioners also have the mandatory duty (Mississippi Code, &#167; 3226) to correct all illegal or improper registrations. Any elector has the right to appeal from any decision of the commissioners in failing to correct illegal or improper registration (Mississippi Code, &#167; 3228).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aim of equity is to adapt judicial power to the needs of the situation. The District Judge's opinion that this matter could best be handled in the manner he has handled it is proven by the record, which is encouraging, to say the least.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the rendition of the District Court's decision of February 5, 1963, the affidavits show that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Ramsey has not committed any acts of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The members of the Clarke County Election Commission have examined the testimony in this case with the view of ascertaining whether or not any of those who testified were illegally registered, and thereafter removed from the poll books the names of at least 24 white voters whose testimony upon examination reflected that they had either been illegally or improperly registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Since January 1, 1963 up to and including November 3, 1963, the, Registrar had received written applications to vote in Clarke County from 246 persons; that of this number, 183 white persons made application for registration and 63 Negroes made application for registration. Nine of the white people have failed to be registered and 174 white people were registered. Of the 63 Negroes applying for registration, 42 have been registered and 21 have not been registered. Of this number, 16 did not sign nor complete same; one was failed because the application was illegible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite evident shortcomings in the past, we have no reason to believe that the Registrar is not making a good faith attempt to register voters without conscious race discrimination just as he was ordered to do. We feel the people of Clarke County will see that this matter is handled harmoniously and without discrimination. Mississippi law provides adequate remedies for the purging of these improperly registered voters, and a proper reinvigoration of state responsibility it is hoped will make unnecessary any further incursion of federal authority into Clarke County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is only when a State shirks its responsibility that the federal government enters the picture. The paramount interest of this fabulous country of ours requires that both our State and National governments be permitted, without unnecessary interference on either side, to exercise all powers that are legitimately theirs. The rights of each must be mutually respected. This is essential to the preservation of our freedoms and the perpetuity of our system of government (which has given to each American a broader and fuller freedom than anywhere on earth). Here, the Registrar discriminated. The National Government intervened, and its position was fully vindicated by the District Judge, but in vindicating that position he very discreetly did not permit his zeal to needlessly supplant local responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is amended by enjoining not only the present Registrar, but also his successors in office. Then, too, to insure proper compliance and allay the Government's fears, Ramsey and his successors are directed to file monthly reports with the Clerk of the District Court, reflecting the name, address and race of each applicant for registration, the disposition of each application, and if rejected, the reason therefor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court shall retain jurisdiction of this cause for purposes here enumerated and for the purpose of issuing any and all additional orders that may, in its judgment, become necessary or appropriate for the purpose of modifying and/or enforcing its decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As amended, affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX A</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge granted injunctive relief against the County Registrar, A.

I also agree that the judgment should be amended so as to extend the injunction to the successors in office and to require the filing of monthly reports. However, with all deference, I must dissent on the issues relating to the failure to find that the discrimination was pursuant to a pattern or practice and to the refusal to grant relief based on freezing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case reveals gross and flagrant denials of the rights of Negro citizens to vote. The defendant registrar took office in 1953. At the time of trial there were approximately 6000 voting age whites and approximately 3000 voting age Negroes in Clarke County, Mississippi. Of these, approximately 5000 whites and only 3 Negroes were registered to vote. The district court found<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> that around 1500 such registrations involved the illegal registration of unqualified persons or persons who did not take the trouble to go to the registrar's office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> The court found that \"substantially all\" of these instances involved white citizens. The names of five Negroes were added to the rolls without their knowledge, but admittedly for the purpose of avoiding an all-white jury in the trial of a Negro for murder &#8212; some of these names were later stricken. Although less than a dozen different Negroes had tried to register since defendant had been in office, the court stated that defendant told eight of them in each instance to go home and think it over in light of existing racial problems in other parts of the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> The court observed: \"The inescapable effect of what he said and did on such occasions was to deny those negro citizens of their right to be examined for registration and it cannot be otherwise regarded.\" The court went on to note that the only three Negroes who were registered<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> were required to take the statutory test and had to wait several days before being advised of having passed. On the other hand, not all whites had to take the test, and whites were not required to wait. Although white citizens were allowed to register for other members of their family who were not even present, the wife of a 76-year-old Negro who was not physically able to sign his name was not allowed to register for him, nor did the defendant registrar furnish to one physically disabled the assistance required by the Mississippi Constitution, section 244.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Court finds as a fact from the evidence that negro citizens, however, have been discriminated against by the registrar in not according such citizens the statutory right to take such tests to determine whether or not they possess the qualifications to entitle them to register to vote * * *. He did deliberately and improperly deny adult negro citizens who were residents of the county the right to take the legal test for registration. He did nothing to encourage or aid or assist negroes in registration as he did white people * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these findings of discrimination the district court specifically held that \"no pattern or practice of discrimination based on race is shown to exist in this case but such deviations from the law were practiced among both races * * *. [N]o pattern or practice of the registrar in such respect [failing to assist Negroes as he did whites] is established by the evidence in this record within the purview of the act.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of all this, the majority opinion affirms because \"we feel it was within the District Judge's discretion to <i>omit</i> action on that phase of the complaint (United States v. Raines, D.C., 203 F.Supp. 147 (1961)). * * * [T]he District Judge obviously thought it best <i>not to make a specific finding</i> that there was a `pattern.' We do not believe that by the language of subsection (e) of 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 the Congress of the United States intended to impose upon the district courts the mandatory duty of making a finding as to whether a previously found deprivation of rights or privileges was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice, regardless of the District Court's opinion as to the necessity or non-necessity of making such a finding.\" (Emphasis added.) Since the district court in the instant case clearly held that no pattern or practice existed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the majority opinion is apparently holding that it was an abuse of the district judge's discretion to make any ruling at all &#8212; despite the majority's eloquent plea for broad powers of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the majority's paradoxical treatment of the district court's finding of no pattern or practice, I am convinced that there is a mandatory duty on the district court to make some finding as to pattern or practice and that United States v. Raines, supra, was incorrectly decided. It is clear that discretion must give way when there is a specific statutory mandate. Subsection (e) of 42 U.S. C.A. &#167; 1971 provides in no uncertain terms that: \"* * * the court <i>shall</i> upon request of the Attorney General and after each party has been given notice and the opportunity to be heard <i>make a finding whether such deprivation was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"shall\" when used in a statute is usually mandatory, the language of command, unless the legislative history and the policy of the act indicate otherwise. See Escoe v. Zerbst, 1935, 295 U. S. 490, 493-494, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566; Peoples Securities Co. v. SEC, 5 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 268, 274. Legislative history and policy considerations uniformly indicate that \"shall\" was used in this subsection in the mandatory sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It was intended by Congress that a finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination would have two effects: (1) it would serve as a conclusive presumption of discrimination in later applications to the court for qualification to vote, and (2) it would allow the court, should the judge so choose, to make use of the voting referee procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Deputy Attorney General Walsh stated to the Senate Judiciary Committee that under this section the court, upon request, <i>\"must</i> make a finding as to whether the discrimination was pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Similarly, Representative Willis, on the floor of the House, observed: \"[W]hen an injunction suit is filed and an injunction decree is issued, the judge, upon application of the Attorney General, <i>must</i> make a finding as to whether or not the alleged discrimination is pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary makes quite clear the mandatory nature of the finding: \"Under the revised referee plan as contained in H.R. 8601 the court would, upon request of the Attorney General in cases brought to enforce voting rights guaranteed by the 15th amendment, be <i>obligated</i> to make a supplemental finding as to whether the voting deprivations are pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> (Emphasis by the Committee.) In suggesting that an enrollment officer plan be added to the referee plan already in the bill, the Committee noted that under the enrollment officer plan the court \"is not <i>required</i> to make a finding that the deprivation of voting rights is done pursuant to a pattern or practice <i>as would be the case under the court referee proposal.\"</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> (Emphasis added.) Moreover, Senator East-land, on the floor of the Senate, stated in unmistakable terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Then a new step comes into play: The Attorney General requests that the Court make a finding as to whether a pattern or practice of discrimination exists. <i>This is mandatory on the Court. He must make such a finding.\"</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This clear legislative intent is supplemented by a similar interpretation placed on the subsection by the three-judge district court in United States v. Manning, supra.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> It is significant that neither the majority opinion in this case nor the opinion in Raines cites any legislative history tending to show a contrary intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the policy of the subsection favors lack of delay in the processing of applications for qualification and in the use of the voter referee plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Thus the finding as to pattern or practice was made mandatory not only to bring the presumption of discrimination and the referee plan into play, but also to meet the warning of Senator Hart: \"[W]e ought to eliminate, so far as we can, the delays and difficulties in the operation of that device [subsection (e)].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Plaintiffs in civil rights cases, especially voting cases, have already found themselves plagued with unnecessary and unwarranted delays in the trial courts. See the carefully documented Comment, Judicial Performance in the Fifth Circuit, 73 Yale L.J. 90 (1963). Speaking for the Court in United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 1959, 263 F.2d 71, 78, 79, I commented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have called the figures startling, but we do not feign surprise because we have long known that there are counties not only in Mississippi, but in the writer's own home State of Alabama, in which Negroes constitute the majority of the residents but take no part in government either as voters or as jurors. Familiarity with such a condition thus prevents shock, but it all the more increases our concern over its existence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than five years have elapsed since that decision, but the statement still holds true with improvement only minuscule. Concern over such delays has led to a bill now before Congress which would provide, upon request, three-judge courts in voting cases and which would require the district court \"to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Failure to require a ruling on pattern or practice will only add another opportunity for delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt that the district judge's finding of no pattern or practice was clearly erroneous. The legislative history of subsection (e) reveals that a pattern or practice exists when the discrimination is not an isolated or accidental or peculiar event, but part of the regular procedure, the usual situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> The number of Negroes actually turned away or discriminated against may be small.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Here, the trial court's own findings of discrimination conclusively show that a pattern or practice existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also dissent from the majority's failure to grant relief based on freezing. Freezing results when there have been past discriminatory practices in the registration process, these discriminatory practices are discontinued, but new and more onerous requirements are imposed. While theoretically applicable to all, these new requirements primarily affect those who bore the brunt of previous discriminations and tend to maintain the position of advantage which one class has already obtained over the other. See United States v. Louisiana, E.D.La.1963, 225 F.Supp. 353, at pp. 391-398 (three-judge court); United States v. Atkins, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 733, 743-745; cf., United States v. Dogan, 5 Cir. 1963, 314 F.2d 767. Prior to this suit approximately 5000 out of 6000 voting age whites had been registered to vote, but only 3 out of approximately 3000 voting age Negroes had been registered. A large number of these whites would not have been able to meet the strict standards for registration required by Mississippi law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Yet the district court required the registrar to apply these standards to most all of the Negro voting-age population and the few whites who were not already registered. (See Appendix A to the majority opinion.) The freezing effect is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had found that the discrimination existed pursuant to a pattern or practice, then, in accordance with subsection (e), applications by Negroes subsequently rejected by the registrar would be filed with the district court (or at the court's direction with the voting referee). These applicants would not have to meet qualifications \"more stringent than those used by the persons found in the proceeding to have violated subsection (a) of this section in qualifying persons other than those of the race or color against which the pattern or practice of discrimination was found to exist.\" 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(e). Thus the district court's order requiring the use of the stricter standards for applications to the registrar than for applications to the court would be neither good judicial husbandry nor compliance with the intent of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion meets the problem of freezing by pointing out that since the time the judgment of the district court was entered the defendant registrar has not discriminated against Negroes and some 24 whites have been removed from the poll books. But the nondiscriminatory use of the stricter standards does not rectify the freezing effect caused by past injustices,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> and the limited purging is but a meager start to a monumental task. Yet the majority goes on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We <i>feel</i> the people of Clarke County will see that this matter is handled harmoniously and without discrimination. Mississippi law provides adequate remedies for the purging of these improperly registered voters, and a proper reinvigoration of state responsibility it is <i>hoped</i> will make unnecessary any further incursion of federal authority into Clarke County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is only when a State shirks its responsibility that the federal government enters the picture.\" (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the state and its subdivision have shirked their responsibility &#8212; the prior violations of both the federal and state constitutions are appalling. The cessation of these discriminatory practices is hardly an indication that a renaissance has taken place, for the registrar was acting under the threat of an injunction and the past discrimination has securely been sealed into permanent existence. The Constitution and the Civil Rights Acts afford citizens far more than barren hopes that some day their right to vote will materialize through the voluntary actions of previously irresponsible officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The opinion is reported at 8 Race Rel.

We follow the same course in the present case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as full and complete relief can be afforded here without enjoining the State, we hold that the court below was correct in its dismissal of the State as a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some discussion was had between the parties in the argument of this case concerning the application of the freezing principle. As shown in the Atkins decision, this Court has had the principle under discussion, but has not been faced with a case which required a decision on the subject. Under the facts here, we think that adequate and proper relief is provided by the judgment of the court below, as hereinafter modified, and we pretermit further discussion of the principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the same is true of the appellant's contention with respect to pattern and practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant vigorously challenges the finding of discrimination. In the face of testimony which witness by witness convicts Ramsey of palpable discrimination, the District Court was certainly correct in its finding of discrimination. The Government argues strenuously that the lower court erred in not finding a pattern of discrimination. Assuming that the District Judge would have been justified in finding the existence of a \"pattern or practice of discrimination,\" we pretermit any definitive action on this facet of the case because we feel it was within the District Judge's discretion to omit action on that phase of the complaint (United States v. Raines, D.C., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></span> (1961)). It is apparent to us that the District Judge has obviously made an intelligent and sincere effort to guarantee to all persons in Clarke County, regardless of race, a full opportunity to register and vote without discrimination. He has granted a sweeping injunction against discrimination. The relief granted appears to be carefully designed to provide to Negro citizens of Clarke County the greatest protection and safeguard of their right to register and vote, while maintaining, as far as is consistent with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, the delicate balance between State and Federal relations. Registration is a State function; it can best be carried out by the appropriate State officials. But, if one man's rights are denied, the rights of all are endangered. In our country the courts have a most important obligation to protect the rights of all and to do it as harmoniously as possible. In his endeavor to do just this, the District Judge obviously thought it best not to make a specific finding that there was a \"pattern.\" We do not believe that by the language of subsection (e) of 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 the Congress of the United States intended to impose upon the district courts the mandatory duty of making a finding as to whether a previously found deprivation of rights or privileges was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice, regardless of the District Court's opinion as to the necessity or non-necessity of making such a finding. A federal district court is a court of equity, and as such has broad powers of discretion. Judge Cox heard the evidence; he knows the circumstances; he is the appropriate person to decide what orders are proper and necessary. Discretion is a fundamental attribute of equity. \"Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.\" This language is quoted from the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi had<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> declared the rights of the Negro plaintiffs, but declined to issue an injunction, using in part this language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"I am further of the opinion that during this period of turmoil the time now has arrived when the judiciary should not issue injunctions perfunctorily, but should place trust in men of high character that they will obey the mandate of the Court without an injunction hanging over their heads. Neither the facts in the present case nor the exigencies of the situation are sufficient or urgent enough to require the granting of an injunction.\" (206 F.Supp. page 543).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the action of the District Court, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span>. The Supreme Court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> denied certiorari, thus leaving in effect this Court's holding that the discretion of the District Court was correctly used in declaring the rights of the plaintiffs, but declining to issue an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So here, the District Court has granted substantial relief to the plaintiffs, and the relief so granted was, in his opinion, sufficient under the circumstances to guarantee to all persons in Clarke County, regardless of race or color, a full opportunity to register and vote without discrimination. Both the State's rights and the rights of the United States were safeguarded. The rightful authority of the United States was vindicated and the District Judge, familiar with the facts, selected the method of enforcement which he thought was most appropriate. If good faith non-discriminatory registration is not provided, the remedy will be to reopen the case so that the District Judge may grant whatever further relief the facts may justify. The case will remain on the docket of the District Court and that Court will retain jurisdiction of the entire matter for the purpose of making any and all additional findings and conclusions and of entering any and all additional orders as may, in his opinion, be necessary or appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN NOT GRANTING THE COMPLETE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Registration is a prerequisite to voting in Mississippi. Registration is permanent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The United States asks that we reverse the District Judge and order him to enter a mandate setting forth certain specific requirements to enable a man to register in Mississippi; then the Government requests that the mandate be amplified by spelling out for the Registrar just what standards he must apply. Admittedly, this would force the Registrar to violate the law of his State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Mississippi law (Mississippi Code, &#167;&#167; 3113 and 3239) the Commissioners of election of each county have the duty to erase the names of all persons erroneously registered. These commissioners also have the mandatory duty (Mississippi Code, &#167; 3226) to correct all illegal or improper registrations. Any elector has the right to appeal from any decision of the commissioners in failing to correct illegal or improper registration (Mississippi Code, &#167; 3228).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aim of equity is to adapt judicial power to the needs of the situation. The District Judge's opinion that this matter could best be handled in the manner he has handled it is proven by the record, which is encouraging, to say the least.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the rendition of the District Court's decision of February 5, 1963, the affidavits show that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Ramsey has not committed any acts of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The members of the Clarke County Election Commission have examined the testimony in this case with the view of ascertaining whether or not any of those who testified were illegally registered, and thereafter removed from the poll books the names of at least 24 white voters whose testimony upon examination reflected that they had either been illegally or improperly registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Since January 1, 1963 up to and including November 3, 1963, the, Registrar had received written applications to vote in Clarke County from 246 persons; that of this number, 183 white persons made application for registration and 63 Negroes made application for registration. Nine of the white people have failed to be registered and 174 white people were registered. Of the 63 Negroes applying for registration, 42 have been registered and 21 have not been registered. Of this number, 16 did not sign nor complete same; one was failed because the application was illegible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite evident shortcomings in the past, we have no reason to believe that the Registrar is not making a good faith attempt to register voters without conscious race discrimination just as he was ordered to do. We feel the people of Clarke County will see that this matter is handled harmoniously and without discrimination. Mississippi law provides adequate remedies for the purging of these improperly registered voters, and a proper reinvigoration of state responsibility it is hoped will make unnecessary any further incursion of federal authority into Clarke County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is only when a State shirks its responsibility that the federal government enters the picture. The paramount interest of this fabulous country of ours requires that both our State and National governments be permitted, without unnecessary interference on either side, to exercise all powers that are legitimately theirs. The rights of each must be mutually respected. This is essential to the preservation of our freedoms and the perpetuity of our system of government (which has given to each American a broader and fuller freedom than anywhere on earth). Here, the Registrar discriminated. The National Government intervened, and its position was fully vindicated by the District Judge, but in vindicating that position he very discreetly did not permit his zeal to needlessly supplant local responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is amended by enjoining not only the present Registrar, but also his successors in office. Then, too, to insure proper compliance and allay the Government's fears, Ramsey and his successors are directed to file monthly reports with the Clerk of the District Court, reflecting the name, address and race of each applicant for registration, the disposition of each application, and if rejected, the reason therefor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court shall retain jurisdiction of this cause for purposes here enumerated and for the purpose of issuing any and all additional orders that may, in its judgment, become necessary or appropriate for the purpose of modifying and/or enforcing its decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As amended, affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX A</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge granted injunctive relief against the County Registrar, A.

I also agree that the judgment should be amended so as to extend the injunction to the successors in office and to require the filing of monthly reports. However, with all deference, I must dissent on the issues relating to the failure to find that the discrimination was pursuant to a pattern or practice and to the refusal to grant relief based on freezing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case reveals gross and flagrant denials of the rights of Negro citizens to vote. The defendant registrar took office in 1953. At the time of trial there were approximately 6000 voting age whites and approximately 3000 voting age Negroes in Clarke County, Mississippi. Of these, approximately 5000 whites and only 3 Negroes were registered to vote. The district court found<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> that around 1500 such registrations involved the illegal registration of unqualified persons or persons who did not take the trouble to go to the registrar's office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> The court found that \"substantially all\" of these instances involved white citizens. The names of five Negroes were added to the rolls without their knowledge, but admittedly for the purpose of avoiding an all-white jury in the trial of a Negro for murder &#8212; some of these names were later stricken. Although less than a dozen different Negroes had tried to register since defendant had been in office, the court stated that defendant told eight of them in each instance to go home and think it over in light of existing racial problems in other parts of the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> The court observed: \"The inescapable effect of what he said and did on such occasions was to deny those negro citizens of their right to be examined for registration and it cannot be otherwise regarded.\" The court went on to note that the only three Negroes who were registered<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> were required to take the statutory test and had to wait several days before being advised of having passed. On the other hand, not all whites had to take the test, and whites were not required to wait. Although white citizens were allowed to register for other members of their family who were not even present, the wife of a 76-year-old Negro who was not physically able to sign his name was not allowed to register for him, nor did the defendant registrar furnish to one physically disabled the assistance required by the Mississippi Constitution, section 244.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Court finds as a fact from the evidence that negro citizens, however, have been discriminated against by the registrar in not according such citizens the statutory right to take such tests to determine whether or not they possess the qualifications to entitle them to register to vote * * *. He did deliberately and improperly deny adult negro citizens who were residents of the county the right to take the legal test for registration. He did nothing to encourage or aid or assist negroes in registration as he did white people * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these findings of discrimination the district court specifically held that \"no pattern or practice of discrimination based on race is shown to exist in this case but such deviations from the law were practiced among both races * * *. [N]o pattern or practice of the registrar in such respect [failing to assist Negroes as he did whites] is established by the evidence in this record within the purview of the act.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of all this, the majority opinion affirms because \"we feel it was within the District Judge's discretion to <i>omit</i> action on that phase of the complaint (United States v. Raines, D.C., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></span> (1961)). * * * [T]he District Judge obviously thought it best <i>not to make a specific finding</i> that there was a `pattern.' We do not believe that by the language of subsection (e) of 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971 the Congress of the United States intended to impose upon the district courts the mandatory duty of making a finding as to whether a previously found deprivation of rights or privileges was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice, regardless of the District Court's opinion as to the necessity or non-necessity of making such a finding.\" (Emphasis added.) Since the district court in the instant case clearly held that no pattern or practice existed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the majority opinion is apparently holding that it was an abuse of the district judge's discretion to make any ruling at all &#8212; despite the majority's eloquent plea for broad powers of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the majority's paradoxical treatment of the district court's finding of no pattern or practice, I am convinced that there is a mandatory duty on the district court to make some finding as to pattern or practice and that United States v. Raines, supra, was incorrectly decided. It is clear that discretion must give way when there is a specific statutory mandate. Subsection (e) of 42 U.S. C.A. &#167; 1971 provides in no uncertain terms that: \"* * * the court <i>shall</i> upon request of the Attorney General and after each party has been given notice and the opportunity to be heard <i>make a finding whether such deprivation was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"shall\" when used in a statute is usually mandatory, the language of command, unless the legislative history and the policy of the act indicate otherwise.

Legislative history and policy considerations uniformly indicate that \"shall\" was used in this subsection in the mandatory sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It was intended by Congress that a finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination would have two effects: (1) it would serve as a conclusive presumption of discrimination in later applications to the court for qualification to vote, and (2) it would allow the court, should the judge so choose, to make use of the voting referee procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Deputy Attorney General Walsh stated to the Senate Judiciary Committee that under this section the court, upon request, <i>\"must</i> make a finding as to whether the discrimination was pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Similarly, Representative Willis, on the floor of the House, observed: \"[W]hen an injunction suit is filed and an injunction decree is issued, the judge, upon application of the Attorney General, <i>must</i> make a finding as to whether or not the alleged discrimination is pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary makes quite clear the mandatory nature of the finding: \"Under the revised referee plan as contained in H.R. 8601 the court would, upon request of the Attorney General in cases brought to enforce voting rights guaranteed by the 15th amendment, be <i>obligated</i> to make a supplemental finding as to whether the voting deprivations are pursuant to a pattern or practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> (Emphasis by the Committee.) In suggesting that an enrollment officer plan be added to the referee plan already in the bill, the Committee noted that under the enrollment officer plan the court \"is not <i>required</i> to make a finding that the deprivation of voting rights is done pursuant to a pattern or practice <i>as would be the case under the court referee proposal.\"</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> (Emphasis added.) Moreover, Senator East-land, on the floor of the Senate, stated in unmistakable terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Then a new step comes into play: The Attorney General requests that the Court make a finding as to whether a pattern or practice of discrimination exists. <i>This is mandatory on the Court. He must make such a finding.\"</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This clear legislative intent is supplemented by a similar interpretation placed on the subsection by the three-judge district court in United States v. Manning, supra.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> It is significant that neither the majority opinion in this case nor the opinion in Raines cites any legislative history tending to show a contrary intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the policy of the subsection favors lack of delay in the processing of applications for qualification and in the use of the voter referee plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Thus the finding as to pattern or practice was made mandatory not only to bring the presumption of discrimination and the referee plan into play, but also to meet the warning of Senator Hart: \"[W]e ought to eliminate, so far as we can, the delays and difficulties in the operation of that device [subsection (e)].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Plaintiffs in civil rights cases, especially voting cases, have already found themselves plagued with unnecessary and unwarranted delays in the trial courts. See the carefully documented Comment, Judicial Performance in the Fifth Circuit, 73 Yale L.J. 90 (1963). Speaking for the Court in United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 1959, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"247119\"><a href=\"/opinion/247119/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-robert-lee-goldsby-v-william-harpole/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 78, 79, I commented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have called the figures startling, but we do not feign surprise because we have long known that there are counties not only in Mississippi, but in the writer's own home State of Alabama, in which Negroes constitute the majority of the residents but take no part in government either as voters or as jurors. Familiarity with such a condition thus prevents shock, but it all the more increases our concern over its existence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than five years have elapsed since that decision, but the statement still holds true with improvement only minuscule. Concern over such delays has led to a bill now before Congress which would provide, upon request, three-judge courts in voting cases and which would require the district court \"to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Failure to require a ruling on pattern or practice will only add another opportunity for delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt that the district judge's finding of no pattern or practice was clearly erroneous. The legislative history of subsection (e) reveals that a pattern or practice exists when the discrimination is not an isolated or accidental or peculiar event, but part of the regular procedure, the usual situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> The number of Negroes actually turned away or discriminated against may be small.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Here, the trial court's own findings of discrimination conclusively show that a pattern or practice existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also dissent from the majority's failure to grant relief based on freezing. Freezing results when there have been past discriminatory practices in the registration process, these discriminatory practices are discontinued, but new and more onerous requirements are imposed. While theoretically applicable to all, these new requirements primarily affect those who bore the brunt of previous discriminations and tend to maintain the position of advantage which one class has already obtained over the other.

Prior to this suit approximately 5000 out of 6000 voting age whites had been registered to vote, but only 3 out of approximately 3000 voting age Negroes had been registered. A large number of these whites would not have been able to meet the strict standards for registration required by Mississippi law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Yet the district court required the registrar to apply these standards to most all of the Negro voting-age population and the few whites who were not already registered.

The freezing effect is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had found that the discrimination existed pursuant to a pattern or practice, then, in accordance with subsection (e), applications by Negroes subsequently rejected by the registrar would be filed with the district court (or at the court's direction with the voting referee). These applicants would not have to meet qualifications \"more stringent than those used by the persons found in the proceeding to have violated subsection (a) of this section in qualifying persons other than those of the race or color against which the pattern or practice of discrimination was found to exist.\" 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1971(e). Thus the district court's order requiring the use of the stricter standards for applications to the registrar than for applications to the court would be neither good judicial husbandry nor compliance with the intent of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion meets the problem of freezing by pointing out that since the time the judgment of the district court was entered the defendant registrar has not discriminated against Negroes and some 24 whites have been removed from the poll books. But the nondiscriminatory use of the stricter standards does not rectify the freezing effect caused by past injustices,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> and the limited purging is but a meager start to a monumental task. Yet the majority goes on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We <i>feel</i> the people of Clarke County will see that this matter is handled harmoniously and without discrimination. Mississippi law provides adequate remedies for the purging of these improperly registered voters, and a proper reinvigoration of state responsibility it is <i>hoped</i> will make unnecessary any further incursion of federal authority into Clarke County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is only when a State shirks its responsibility that the federal government enters the picture.\" (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the state and its subdivision have shirked their responsibility &#8212; the prior violations of both the federal and state constitutions are appalling. The cessation of these discriminatory practices is hardly an indication that a renaissance has taken place, for the registrar was acting under the threat of an injunction and the past discrimination has securely been sealed into permanent existence. The Constitution and the Civil Rights Acts afford citizens far more than barren hopes that some day their right to vote will materialize through the voluntary actions of previously irresponsible officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The opinion is reported at 8 Race Rel.
