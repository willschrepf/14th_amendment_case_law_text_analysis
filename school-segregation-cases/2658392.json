It also purchased three newspaper\nadvertisements. As a result of these expenditures and\ncontributions, A-1 was required to register as a “noncandidate\ncommittee,” and was subjected to reporting and disclosure\nrequirements (HRS § 11-302) and advertising disclaimer\nrequirements (HRS § 11-391). A1, which plans to run similar\nadvertisements and make similar contributions to candidates\nin the future, objects to both the disclaimer requirement and\nthe noncandidate committee registration and reporting\nrequirements.\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f4               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    Addressing A-1's Fourteenth Amendment due process\nvagueness challenge to Hawaii’s reporting and disclosure\nrequirements, the panel held that HRS § 11-302’s definitions\nof “expenditure,” and “noncandidate committee” were not\nvague given the narrowing construction of the term\n“influence” proffered by Hawaii’s Campaign Spending\nCommission. The panel also held that § 11-302’s definition\nof “advertisement” was not unconstitutionally vague because\nread as a whole and in context it was sufficiently clear to give\na person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to\nknow what was prohibited.\n\n    Addressing the First Amendment challenges, the panel\nheld that the registration, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements that Hawaii places on “noncandidate\ncommittees” survived exacting scrutiny as applied to A-1.\nThe panel held that the requirements were substantially\nrelated to Hawaii’s important interests in informing the\nelectorate, preventing corruption or its appearance, and\navoiding the circumvention of valid campaign finance laws.\nThe panel also held that Hawaii’s requirement that political\nadvertising include a disclaimer as to the affiliation of the\nadvertiser with a candidate or candidate committee did not\nviolate the First Amendment as applied to A-1’s political\nadvertisements.\n\n   The panel declined to consider A1’s challenge to\nHawaii’s electioneering communication reporting\nrequirements (HRS § 341) because it determined that A-1\nwas not subject to those requirements as of the date the\ncomplaint was filed.\n\n  The panel rejected A-1’s First Amendment challenge to\nHawaii’s ban on campaign contributions by government\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                     5\n\ncontractors to candidates or candidate committees, (HRS\n§ 11-355). The panel held that Hawaii’s government\ncontractor contribution ban survived closely drawn scrutiny\neven as applied to A-1’s proposed contributions to candidates\nwho neither decide whether A-1 receives contracts nor\noversee A-1’s contracts.\n\n    The panel held that the individual plaintiffs were entitled\nto attorney’s fees arising from their prior interlocutory appeal\nchallenging HRS § 11-358, which prohibited any person from\nmaking contributions to a noncandidate committee in an\naggregate amount greater than $1,000 in an election. The\npanel held that because plaintiffs prevailed in the\ninterlocutory appeal, and subsequently became prevailing\nparties after the district court entered judgment in their favor,\nthe district court erred by failing to consider whether to award\nthem reasonable appellate attorney’s fees. The panel referred\nthe matter to the Ninth Circuit Appellate Commissioner to\ndetermine the amount of fees to be awarded.\n\n\n                         COUNSEL\n\nRandy Elf (argued) & James Bopp, Jr., James Madison\nCenter for Free Speech, Terre Haute, Indiana; James\nHochberg, Honolulu, Hawaii, for Plaintiff-Appellant.\n\nJustin L.

Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010),\nand related authority. A-1 A-Lectrician, Inc. (A-1), a for-\nprofit corporation, appeals the district court’s summary\njudgment in favor of members of Hawaii’s Campaign\nSpending Commission (“the Commission”). Relying on\nHuman Life of Washington Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d 990\n(9th Cir. 2010), we hold that the challenged laws satisfy the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n                      I. Background\n\n    The plaintiffs are Jimmy Yamada, Russell Stewart and A-\n1. Before the 2010 general election, Yamada and Stewart\neach sought to contribute $2,500 to the Aloha Family\nAlliance–Political Action Committee (AFA-PAC), a\nregistered “noncandidate committee” that makes independent\ncampaign expenditures in Hawaii elections. They were\nforbidden from doing so, however, by Hawaii Revised Statute\n(HRS) § 11-358, which prohibits any person from “mak[ing]\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  7\n\ncontributions to a noncandidate committee in an aggregate\namount greater than $1,000 in an election.”\n\n    Plaintiff A-1 is a Hawaii electrical-construction\ncorporation that makes campaign contributions and engages\nin political speech. Yamada is its CEO. During the 2010\nelection, A-1 contributed over $50,000 to candidates,\ncandidate committees and party committees. It also\npurchased three newspaper advertisements at a cost of $2,000\nto $3,000 each. Under the heading “Freedom Under Siege,”\nthese advertisements declared that Hawaiians had “lost our\nfreedom” because “we have representatives who do not listen\nto the people.” One advertisement asserted State House\nMajority Leader Blake Oshiro and other representatives were\n“intent on the destruction of the family.” Another accused\nOshiro and his colleagues of “disrespect[ing] the legislative\nprocess and the people.” In accordance with Hawaii law, see\nHRS § 11-391(a)(2)(B), all three advertisements included a\ndisclaimer that they were “[p]ublished without the approval\nand authority of the candidate.”\n\n    As a result of these expenditures and contributions,\nHawaii law required A-1 to register as a “noncandidate\ncommittee” as defined by HRS § 11-302. Section 11-302\nimposes reporting and disclosure requirements on any\norganization that has “the purpose of making or receiving\ncontributions, making expenditures, or incurring financial\nobligations to influence [elections]” over $1,000 in the\naggregate for an election cycle. Id.; see HRS § 11-321(g).\nA-1, which plans to run similar advertisements and to make\nsimilar contributions to candidates in the future, objects to\nboth the disclaimer requirement and the noncandidate\ncommittee registration and reporting requirements.\n\f8                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    If A-1 is relieved of the obligation of registering as a\nnoncandidate committee, it could be subject to reporting\nrequirements associated with “electioneering\ncommunications” because it seeks to publish newspaper\nadvertisements that mention candidates by name shortly\nbefore an election. See HRS § 11-341. Every entity that\nmakes a disbursement for an electioneering communication,\nsuch as A-1’s newspaper advertisements, must report certain\nidentifying information to the Commission within 24 hours of\ncertain disclosure dates. See id. Under the regulations in\neffect when A-1 filed this action, if A-1 were to remain a\nnoncandidate committee, however, it would not have to file\nan electioneering communications report or comply with the\nprovisions of HRS § 11-341. See Haw. Admin. Rule (HAR)\n§ 3-160-48.1\n\n   Finally, A-1 is often a state government contractor, and\nwhen it has such contracts, Hawaii law prohibits it from\nmaking campaign contributions to candidates or candidate\ncommittees. See HRS § 11-355. A-1 challenges that\nprohibition as applied to its speech, although it declares it\nseeks to contribute only to lawmakers who neither award nor\noversee its public contracts.\n\n    Shortly before the 2010 primary election, Yamada,\nStewart and A-1 filed a nine-count complaint challenging the\nconstitutionality of five provisions of Hawaii campaign\nfinance law. Yamada and Stewart challenged the $1,000\nlimit on contributions to noncandidate committees, HRS\n§ 11-358, and A-1 challenged four other provisions: (1) the\n\n\n    1\n    On November 5, 2014, an amendment to HRS § 11-341 went into\neffect, requiring registered noncandidate committees to file electioneering\ncommunications statements. See 2013 Haw. Sess. L. Act 112.\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   9\n\nrequirement that it register as a noncandidate committee and\nthe associated expenditure definition, HRS § 11-302; (2) if it\ndoes not have to register as a noncandidate committee, the\nrequirement that it report identifying information when it\nmakes an electioneering communication, HRS § 11-341;\n(3) the requirement that its advertisements include certain\ndisclaimers, HRS § 11-391; and (4) the ban on contributions\nfrom government contractors to state legislative candidates,\nHRS § 11-355.\n\n    In October 2010, the district court preliminarily enjoined\nenforcement of the $1,000 contribution limit, HRS § 11-358,\nas applied to Yamada’s and Stewart’s proposed $2,500\ncontributions to AFA-PAC, a noncandidate committee. See\nYamada v. Kuramoto, 744 F. Supp. 2d 1075, 1078, 1087 (D.\nHaw. 2010) (Yamada I). The court denied A-1’s motion for\na preliminary injunction on its first, second and third claims.\nSee Yamada v. Kuramoto, No. 10-cv-00497, 2010 WL\n4603936, at *20 (D. Haw. Oct. 29, 2010) (Yamada II). A-1\ndid not seek to enjoin the government contractor ban. The\ndefendants appealed the preliminary injunction of § 11-358\nbut dismissed their appeal before argument.\n\n    On the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the\ndistrict court permanently enjoined the $1,000 contribution\nlimit, HRS § 11-358, as applied to Yamada’s and Stewart’s\ncontributions to AFA-PAC and rejected each of A-1’s\nconstitutional challenges. See Yamada v. Weaver, 872 F.\nSupp. 2d 1023, 1027–28, 1063 (D. Haw. 2012) (Yamada III).\nA-1 appeals the denial of summary judgment on its claims.\nThe defendants have not cross-appealed the court’s\ninvalidation of § 11-358.\n\f10              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    Yamada and Stewart sought their attorney’s fees under\n41 U.S.C. § 1988 based on their successful constitutional\nchallenge to the $1,000 contribution limit. The district court\nawarded them $60,152.65 in fees and $3,623.29 in costs.\nYamada and Stewart appeal that award in several respects,\nincluding the district court’s denial of the fees they incurred\ndefending against the defendants’ abandoned appeal of the\npreliminary injunction ruling.\n\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and review\nA-1’s constitutional challenges de novo. See Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1000. A-1 raises three groups of issues on\nappeal: (1) whether the expenditure, noncandidate committee\nand advertisement definitions are unconstitutionally vague;\n(2) whether the noncandidate committee definition and\nadvertising disclaimer and electioneering communications\nreporting requirements impose unconstitutional burdens on\nspeech; and (3) whether the ban on contributions by\ngovernment contractors is unconstitutional as applied to A-\n1’s proposed contributions. Yamada and Stewart also appeal\nthe partial denial of attorney’s fees. We address these issues\nin turn.\n\n          II. Due Process Vagueness Challenge\n\n    We begin by addressing A-1’s argument that § 11-302’s\ndefinitions of “expenditure,” “noncandidate committee” and\n“advertisement” are unconstitutionally vague under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A law is\nunconstitutionally vague when it “fails to provide a person of\nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so\nstandardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously\ndiscriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams,\n553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008). This doctrine “addresses at least\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  11\n\ntwo connected but discrete due process concerns: first, that\nregulated parties should know what is required of them so\nthey may act accordingly; second, precision and guidance are\nnecessary so that those enforcing the law do not act in an\narbitrary or discriminatory way.” FCC v. Fox Television\nStations, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 2307, 2317 (2012). Where, as here,\nFirst Amendment freedoms are involved, “rigorous adherence\nto those requirements is necessary to ensure that ambiguity\ndoes not chill protected speech.” Id. Even for regulations of\nexpressive activity, however, “perfect clarity and precise\nguidance” are not required, Ward v. Rock Against Racism,\n491 U.S. 781, 794 (1989), because “we can never expect\nmathematical certainty from our language,” Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1019 (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford,\n408 U.S. 104, 110 (1972)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    In evaluating A-1’s challenges, we must consider “any\nlimiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency\nhas proffered.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 796 (quoting Vill. of\nHoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S.\n489, 494 n.5 (1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nmay impose a limiting construction on a statute, however,\n“only if it is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construction.”\nReno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 884 (1997) (quoting Virginia v.\nAm. Booksellers Ass’n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988)). We will\nnot “insert missing terms into the statute or adopt an\ninterpretation precluded by the plain language of the\nordinance.” Foti v. City of Menlo Park, 146 F.3d 629, 639\n(9th Cir. 1998).\n\f12             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nA. Hawaii’s Expenditure and Noncandidate Committee\n  Definitions Are Not Vague Given the Commission’s\n               Narrowing Construction\n\n    A-1’s first vagueness challenge is to the expenditure and\nnoncandidate committee definitions. Section 11-302 defines\nan “expenditure” to include:\n\n       (1) Any purchase or transfer of money or\n       anything of value, or promise or agreement to\n       purchase or transfer money or anything of\n       value, or payment incurred or made, or the use\n       or consumption of a nonmonetary\n       contribution for the purpose of:\n\n           (A) Influencing the nomination for\n           election, or the election, of any person\n           seeking nomination for election or\n           election to office, whether or not the\n           person has filed the person’s nomination\n           papers;\n\n           (B) Influencing the outcome of any\n           question or issue that has been certified to\n           appear on the ballot at the next applicable\n           election . . . .\n\nHRS § 11-302 (emphasis added). It defines a “noncandidate\ncommittee” as:\n\n       [A]n organization, association, party, or\n       individual that has the purpose of making or\n       receiving contributions, making expenditures,\n       or incurring financial obligations to influence\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  13\n\n       the nomination for election, or the election, of\n       any candidate to office, or for or against any\n       question or issue on the ballot . . . .\n\nId. (emphasis added). Noncandidate committees are Hawaii’s\nversion of independent expenditure committees, similar to the\nWashington “political committee” definition we addressed in\nHuman Life. See 624 F.3d at 997.\n\n    A-1 challenges these definitions under Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U.S. 1, 77 (1976) (per curiam), which held that the terms\n“influencing” and “for the purpose of influencing” were\nunconstitutionally vague when used to delineate types of\nspeech subject to regulation. Id. at 77–82. If both definitions\nare unconstitutionally vague, Hawaii cannot constitutionally\nimpose noncandidate committee status and the accompanying\nregistration and reporting burdens on A-1.\n\n    Like the district court, we assume without deciding that\nthe term “influence” may be vague under some\ncircumstances. “Conceivably falling within the meaning of\n‘influence’ are objectives as varied as advocacy for or against\na candidate’s election; championing an issue for inclusion in\na candidate’s platform; and encouraging all candidates to\nembrace public funding.” Nat’l Org. for Marriage v. McKee,\n649 F.3d 34, 65 (1st Cir. 2011). But the Commission has\noffered and the district court applied a limiting construction\non the term “influence” in § 11-302’s definitions of\n“expenditure” and “noncandidate committee,” eliminating\nthis potential vagueness.         Under the Commission’s\ninterpretation, “influence” refers only to “communications or\nactivities that constitute express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent.” This interpretation significantly narrows the\nstatutory language, because “express advocacy” requires\n\f14              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nwords “such as ‘vote for,’ ‘elect,’ ‘support,’ ‘cast your ballot\nfor,’ ‘Smith for Congress,’ ‘vote against,’ ‘defeat,’ ‘reject,’”\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 44 n.52, and communications are the\n“functional equivalent of express advocacy” only when they\nare “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as\nan appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,” Fed.\nElection Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S.\n449, 469–70 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).\n\n    A-1 argues that the proffered limiting construction does\nnot render § 11-302 constitutional because (1) it is\ninconsistent with the plain language of the statute, thus\nbarring us from adopting it, and (2) even if we could adopt it,\nthe challenged definitions remain unconstitutionally vague.\nWe find neither argument persuasive.\n\n                               1.\n\n    The Commission’s proffered construction is not\ninconsistent with the plain language of the statute. We have\npreviously noted that the term “influencing” is susceptible to\na narrowing construction, see ACLU of Nev. v. Heller,\n378 F.3d 979, 986 n.5 (9th Cir. 2004), and the Commission’s\ninterpretation of “influence” is consistent with Buckley, which\nconstrued the phrase “for the purpose of . . . influencing” to\nmean “communications that expressly advocate the election\nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate,” 424 U.S. at 79, 80\n(footnote omitted). Given the substantial similarity between\nthe statutory language in Buckley and the language at issue\nhere, the Commission’s gloss is entirely reasonable.\nCompare 2 U.S.C. § 431(f) (1971), with HRS § 11-302.\n\n    Moreover, the Commission reasonably construes the\nstatute as referring not only to express advocacy but also to\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  15\n\nits functional equivalent. After Buckley, case law and Federal\nElection Commission regulations have broadened the concept\nof express advocacy to include its “functional equivalent,” as\ndefined in Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U.S. at 469–70. See\n11 C.F.R. § 100.22; Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v. Fed.\nElection Comm’n, 681 F.3d 544, 550–53 (4th Cir. 2012)\n(discussing the evolution of the “functional equivalent of\nexpress advocacy” concept).              Elsewhere, Hawaii’s\nCommission has adopted a regulation defining express\nadvocacy with reference to its functional equivalent, or as\ncommunications that are “susceptible to no other reasonable\ninterpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a\ncandidate.” HAR § 3-160-6. The Commission’s proposed\nconstruction is consistent with Buckley, subsequent Supreme\nCourt decisions, federal regulations and other Commission\nregulations. The proposed construction, therefore, is neither\nunreasonable nor foreclosed by the plain language of the\nstatute. See Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc. v. Barland,\n751 F.3d 804, 832–34 (7th Cir. 2014) (limiting “for the\npurpose of influencing the election or nomination for election\nof any individual to state or local office” to express advocacy\nand its functional equivalent); McKee, 649 F.3d at 66–67\n(construing “influencing” and “influence” in Maine campaign\nfinance statutes to include only communications that\nconstitute express advocacy or its functional equivalent).\n\n    The legislative history of Hawaii’s noncandidate\ncommittee and expenditure definitions lends further validity\nto the Commission’s interpretation. In 1979, the Hawaii\nlegislature revised state campaign finance laws to harmonize\nthem with Buckley. See 1979 Haw. Sess. L. Act 224; Conf.\nComm. Rep. No. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137, 1140 (1979). The\nlegislature was “mindful” that Buckley “narrowly construed\nthe operation of the federal spending and contribution\n\f16                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\ndisclosure requirements” to encompass only\n“communications that expressly advocate the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Conf. Comm. Rep.\nNo. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137, 1140 (1979). Thus, as the district\ncourt concluded, “[i]t is reasonable to infer . . . that Hawaii’s\nLegislature adopted terminology such as ‘to influence’ in\nreliance on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the same\nterminology in federal law.” Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at\n1046. We agree.2\n\n     A-1 nonetheless contends we should not adopt the\nnarrowing construction because it would not bind a state\ncourt and therefore provides insufficient protection for First\nAmendment values. We again disagree. By adopting a\n“‘readily apparent’ constitutional interpretation,” we provide\nA-1 and other parties not before the court “sufficient\nprotection from unconstitutional application of the statute, as\nit is quite likely nonparty prosecutors and state courts will\napply the same interpretation.” Planned Parenthood of\nIdaho, Inc. v. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 932 (9th Cir. 2004); see\nalso Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1022 n.15\n(9th Cir. 2013).3\n\n  2\n    A-1 draws a different inference from this legislative history, arguing\nthat the legislature’s retention of the word “influence” after Buckley\nsuggests that the legislature did not intend to limit the law to express\nadvocacy and its functional equivalent. See Va. Soc’y for Human Life,\nInc. v. Caldwell, 152 F.3d 268, 271 (4th Cir. 1998). We disagree, but\neven if the legislative history is debatable, the Commission’s reasonable\nlimiting interpretation merits our deference. See Vill. of Hoffman Estates,\n455 U.S. at 504; McKee, 649 F.3d at 66.\n  3\n    Like federal courts, Hawaii courts construe state statutes to avoid\nconstitutional infirmities whenever possible. See, e.g., Kapiolani Park\nPres. Soc’y v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 751 P.2d 1022, 1028 (Haw.\n1988) (“Legislative acts . . . are not to be held invalid, or unconstitutional,\n\f                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                        17\n\n    We hold that the Commission’s proffered construction is\nneither unreasonable nor the product of “strained statutory\nconstruction.” Wasden, 376 F.3d at 932. We therefore adopt\nit.\n\n                                  2.\n\n    We also reject A-1’s argument that § 11-302’s definitions\nof “expenditure” and “noncandidate committee” are\nunconstitutionally vague even with this limiting construction\nin place. With the narrowing gloss, these definitions are\nsufficiently precise to provide “a person of ordinary\nintelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.” Williams,\n553 U.S. at 304. Only expenditures for communications that\nexpressly advocate for a candidate or are “susceptible of no\nreasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for\nor against a specific candidate” can trigger noncandidate\ncommittee registration, reporting and disclosure requirements\nunder § 11-302. There is no dispute that “express advocacy”\nis not a vague term, and the controlling opinion in Wisconsin\nRight to Life held the “functional equivalent” or “appeal to\nvote” component of this test also meets the “imperative for\nclarity” that due process requires. 551 U.S. at 474 n.7. That\nclose cases may arise in applying this test does not make it\nunconstitutional, given there will always be an inherent but\npermissible degree of uncertainty in applying any standards-\nbased test. See Williams, 553 U.S. at 306 (“Close cases can\nbe imagined under virtually any statute.”); Real Truth,\n681 F.3d at 554–55. We therefore join the First, Fourth and\nTenth Circuits in holding that the “appeal to vote” language\n\n\nor unconscionable, if such a construction can reasonably be avoided.”).\nWe would therefore expect Hawaii courts to adopt the same limiting\nconstruction.\n\f18              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nis not unconstitutionally vague. See Free Speech v. Fed.\nElection Comm’n, 720 F.3d 788, 795–96 (10th Cir. 2013);\nReal Truth, 681 F.3d at 552, 554 (“[T]he test in Wisconsin\nRight to Life is not vague.”); McKee, 649 F.3d at 70.\n\n   A-1 resists this conclusion, advancing two arguments why\nthe “appeal to vote” language is impermissibly vague.\nNeither is persuasive.\n\n    First, A-1 contends the test is unconstitutionally vague\nbecause Hawaii’s law applies to a broader range of\ncommunications than the provision upheld in Wisconsin Right\nto Life. Wisconsin Right to Life sustained the functional\nequivalent test against a vagueness challenge to the federal\ndefinition of electioneering communications, which covers\nonly broadcast communications, see 551 U.S. at 474 n.7; 2\nU.S.C. § 434(f)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), whereas Hawaii’s\nnoncandidate committee and expenditure definitions extend\nto speech in printed form, see HRS § 11-302. The statute at\nissue in Wisconsin Right to Life also regulated only\ncommunications run shortly before an election, whereas\nHawaii’s statute applies to communications without strict\ntemporal limitations. But these differences are immaterial.\nRegardless of when a communication is aired or printed and\nwhether it appears in print or in a broadcast medium, the\npurveyor of the advertisement has fair notice that the\nregulations reach only those ads that clearly advocate for an\nidentified candidate. Like the Fourth Circuit, we hold that the\nfunctional equivalent language is not unconstitutionally vague\nmerely because it applies more broadly than the federal\nprovision upheld in Wisconsin Right to Life. See Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Tennant, 706 F.3d 270, 280–81\n(4th Cir. 2013).\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  19\n\n    Second, the validity of the functional equivalent test has\nnot been undermined by Citizens United, which struck down\nthe federal electioneering communication definition, see\n1 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3), for which the test was first developed.\nAs the First Circuit explained in rejecting an identical\nargument:\n\n       The basis for Citizens United’s holding on the\n       constitutionality of the electioneering\n       expenditure statute had nothing to do with the\n       appeal-to-vote test . . . . Instead, the decision\n       turned on a reconsideration of prior case law\n       holding that a corporation’s political speech\n       may be subjected to greater regulation than an\n       individual’s. The opinion offered no view on\n       the clarity of the appeal-to-vote test. In fact,\n       the Court itself relied on the appeal-to-vote\n       test in disposing of a threshold argument that\n       the appeal should be resolved on narrower, as-\n       applied grounds.\n\nMcKee, 649 F.3d at 69 (citations omitted); see also Nat’l Org.\nfor Marriage v. Roberts, 753 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1220 (N.D.\nFla. 2010), aff’d, 477 Fed. App’x 584, 585 (11th Cir. 2012)\n(per curiam). We also have relied on the appeal to vote test,\nalbeit in dicta, since Citizens United. See Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1015. We could not have done so if the test was\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n    Accordingly, we sustain Hawaii’s noncandidate\ncommittee and expenditure definitions from A-1’s vagueness\nchallenges. The term “influence” is readily and reasonably\ninterpreted to encompass only “communications or activities\n\f20              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nthat constitute express advocacy or its functional equivalent.”\nAs construed, the definitions are not unconstitutionally vague.\n\n        B. Hawaii’s Advertising Definition is Not\n              Unconstitutionally Vague\n\n    A-1 argues that § 11-302’s advertising definition is\nunconstitutionally vague because it uses the terms\n“advocates,” “supports” and “opposition.” This provision\nspells out when an advertisement must include a disclaimer\nas to whether the ad was disseminated with or without the\napproval of a candidate. See HRS § 11-391. In relevant part,\nHawaii law defines an “advertisement” as:\n\n       any communication, excluding sundry items\n       such as bumper stickers, that:\n\n           (1) Identifies a candidate directly or by\n           implication, or identifies an issue or\n           question that will appear on the ballot at\n           the next applicable election; and\n\n           (2) Advocates or supports the nomination,\n           opposition, or election of the candidate, or\n           advocates the passage or defeat of the\n           issue or question on the ballot.\n\nHRS § 11-302 (emphasis added).\n\n   Applying a narrowing construction to this definition, as\nbefore, the district court limited the reach of “advocates or\nsupports the nomination, opposition, or election of the\ncandidate” to express advocacy or its functional equivalent.\nSee Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1054. With this limiting\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                    21\n\nconstruction, the district court concluded that Hawaii’s\ndefinition of an advertisement was not unconstitutionally\nvague. A-1 contends that the district court impermissibly\nadopted a limiting construction for the same reasons it argues\na limiting construction was inappropriate for the\nnoncandidate committee and expenditure definitions. It\nfurther argues that with or without the limiting construction,\nthe challenged definition is unconstitutionally vague under\nBuckley and McConnell v. Federal Election Commission,\n540 U.S. 93 (2003), overruled on other grounds by Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 365–66. The Commission responds that\nthe definition is not vague even without a limiting\nconstruction.\n\n    We agree with the Commission that Hawaii’s advertising\ndefinition is sufficiently precise without a limiting\nconstruction and therefore decline to adopt one. The words\n“advocates or supports” and “opposition” as used here are\nsubstantially similar to the words “promote,” “oppose,”\n“attack” and “support” that survived a vagueness challenge in\nMcConnell. There, the Court considered a statute defining\n“Federal election activity” as “a public communication that\nrefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . .\nand that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or\nattacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of\nwhether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or\nagainst a candidate).” 2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii). The Court\nnoted that “[t]he words ‘promote,’ ‘oppose,’ ‘attack,’ and\n‘support’ clearly set forth the confines within which potential\nparty speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the\nprovision.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. Because\n“[t]hese words ‘provide explicit standards for those who\napply them’ and ‘give the person of ordinary intelligence a\nreasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,’” the\n\f22                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nCourt held that the provision was not unconstitutionally\nvague. Id. (quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108–09).4\nMcConnell supports the conclusion that Hawaii’s\nadvertisement definition is not unconstitutionally vague.\n\n     Decisions in other circuits also support that conclusion.\nIn McKee, the First Circuit turned away a vagueness\nchallenge to a Maine law using the terms “promoting,”\n“support” and “opposition” in several campaign finance\nprovisions. The terms were not impermissibly vague because\nthey were tied to an “election-related object” – either\n“candidate,” “nomination or election of any candidate” or\n“campaign.” McKee, 649 F.3d at 64. Maine’s expenditure\nstatute, for example, “instructs that reports submitted\npursuant to the provision ‘must state whether the expenditure\nis in support of or in opposition to the candidate.’” Id. at 63\nn.41 (quoting Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(3)(B)). The\nSecond, Fourth and Seventh Circuits have reached similar\nconclusions. See Vermont Right to Life Comm., Inc. v.\nSorrell, 758 F.3d 118, 128–30 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that\n“promotes,” “supports,” “attacks” and “opposes” were not\nvague with reference to a “clearly identified candidate”);\nTennant, 706 F.3d at 286–87 (holding that “promoting or\nopposing” was not vague); Ctr. for Individual Freedom v.\nMadigan, 697 F.3d 464, 485–87, 495 (7th Cir. 2012) (holding\nthat “promote” and “oppose” were not vague).\n\n\n\n 4\n   Joining the First, Second and Fourth Circuits, we reject A-1’s argument\nthat McConnell’s vagueness holding is limited to laws that regulate\ncampaign finance for political parties. See Vermont Right to Life Comm.,\nInc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118, 128 (2d Cir. 2014); Tennant, 706 F.3d at 287\n(“[T]he Court . . . did not limit its holding to situations involving political\nparties.”); McKee, 649 F.3d at 63.\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   23\n\n    As in McKee, Hawaii’s statutes are tied to an election-\nrelated object – the terms “advocates,” “supports” and\n“opposition” refer only to “the nomination . . . or election of\nthe candidate.” HRS § 11-302. So too does the federal law\nupheld in McConnell, which used the words “promote,”\n“oppose,” “attack” and “support” only in relation to a “clearly\nidentified candidate for Federal office.”            2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(20)(A)(iii). Although the terms “advocate,” “support”\nand “opposition” may not, in isolation, offer sufficient clarity\nas to what advertisements must include a disclaimer, their\nproximity to “nomination” or “election of the candidate”\nmake clear the sort of campaign-related advertising for which\na disclaimer must be included. Read as a whole and in\ncontext, the advertisement definition is sufficiently clear to\n“give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.” Grayned, 408 U.S.\nat 108.\n\n    Finally, we reject A-1’s argument that “advocates,” a term\nthat McConnell did not consider, makes Hawaii’s advertising\ndefinition unconstitutionally vague. A-1 relies on Buckley,\nwhich considered a provision that prohibited any person or\ngroup from making “any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly\nidentified candidate during a calendar year which, when\nadded to all other expenditures . . . advocating the election or\ndefeat of such candidate, exceeds $1,000.” 424 U.S. at 42.\nBuckley held that this provision – which imposed a severe\nrestriction on independent spending by all individuals and\ngroups other than political parties and campaign\norganizations – was impermissibly vague because of its\npotential breadth, extending to the discussion of public issues\nuntethered from particular candidates. See id. at 40, 42. The\nCourt therefore construed the provision “to apply only to\nexpenditures for communications that in express terms\n\f24              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate for federal office.” Id. at 44.\n\n    A-1’s contention that “advocates” is unconstitutionally\nvague in this context does not survive the Supreme Court’s\npost-Buckley discussion of nearly identical language in\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. For candidate elections,\nHawaii’s definition uses the word “advocates” only in\nrelation to a communication that (1) identifies a candidate and\n(2) “advocates or supports the nomination, opposition, or\nelection of [that] candidate.” HRS § 11-302. Although the\nword “advocates” was not at issue in McConnell, there is\nnothing unconstitutionally vague about “advocate” when used\nin Hawaii’s advertising definition to refer to communications\nthat identify a candidate for state office and “plead in favor\nof” that candidate’s election. Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 32 (2002). A-1’s vagueness\nchallenge to the Hawaii advertising definition therefore fails.\n\n              III. First Amendment Claims\n\n    A-1 brings First Amendment challenges to (1) the\nregistration, reporting and disclosure requirements that\nHawaii places on “noncandidate committees” and (2) the\nrequirement that political advertisements include a disclaimer\nstating whether they are broadcast or published with the\napproval of a candidate. Because the challenged laws provide\nfor the disclosure and reporting of political spending but do\nnot limit or ban contributions or expenditures, we apply\nexacting scrutiny. See Family PAC v. McKenna, 685 F.3d\n800, 805–06 (9th Cir. 2011); Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1005.\nTo survive this scrutiny, a law must bear a substantial\nrelationship to a sufficiently important governmental interest.\nSee Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 196 (2010); Human Life,\n\f                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         25\n\n624 F.3d at 1008. Put differently, “the strength of the\ngovernmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the\nactual burden on First Amendment rights.” Doe, 561 U.S. at\n196 (quoting Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724,\n744 (2008)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   A. The Noncandidate Committee Reporting and\nDisclosure Requirements Survive Exacting Scrutiny As\n                   Applied to A-1\n\n    We first consider whether the noncandidate committee\nreporting and disclosure requirements satisfy exacting\nscrutiny as applied to A-1. Looking to the burden side of the\nbalance, the district court found that the “registration and\ndisclosure requirements that come with noncandidate\ncommittee status do not present an undue burden on A-1.”\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1052. We agree.\n\n    The noncandidate committee is Hawaii’s method for\nmonitoring and regulating independent political spending in\nstate elections. In relevant part, a noncandidate committee is\nbroadly defined as an organization “that has the purpose of\nmaking or receiving contributions, making expenditures, or\nincurring financial obligations to influence” Hawaii elections.\nHRS § 11-302.5 To paraphrase the statute, and incorporating\nthe Commission’s narrowing construction we adopted earlier\n(see page 20), the noncandidate committee definition is\nlimited to an organization that:\n\n\n\n 5\n   Although noncandidate committee status also extends to an individual\nwho makes contributions or expenditures not of his or her own funds, see\nHRS § 11-302, the parties focus solely on noncandidate committee status\nfor organizations, and we shall do the same.\n\f26              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n       Has “the purpose” of making or receiving\n       contributions, or making expenditures, for\n       communications or activities that constitute\n       express advocacy or its functional equivalent\n       (i.e., that are susceptible of no reasonable\n       interpretation other than as an appeal to vote\n       for or against a specific candidate to office, or\n       for or against any question or issue on the\n       ballot).\n\nExpenditures are further defined as payments or nonmonetary\ncontributions made for the purpose of communications or\nactivities that constitute express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent. See id.; HRS § 11-302.\n\n    Noncandidate committee status is triggered only when an\norganization receives contributions or makes or incurs\nqualifying expenditures totaling more than $1,000 during a\ntwo-year election cycle. See HRS § 11-321(g). Within 10\ndays of reaching this threshold, the organization must register\nas a noncandidate committee by filing an organizational\nreport with the Commission. Id. In addition to registering,\nthe organization must file an organizational report, designate\nofficers, disclose its bank account information, and designate\na treasurer responsible for recording contributions and\nexpenditures and maintaining records for five years. See\nHRS §§ 11-321, 11-323, 11-324, 11-351(a). The committee’s\ncontributions must be segregated from its other funds. See\nHAR § 3-160-21(c).\n\n    Every committee must also comply with reporting\nrequirements tied to election periods. These requirements\ninclude disclosing contributions made and received,\nexpenditures by the committee and the assets on hand at the\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         27\n\nend of the reporting period. See HRS §§ 11-331 (filing of\nreports), 11-335 (noncandidate committee reports), 11-336\n(timing of reports for noncandidate committees), 11-340\n(penalties for failure to file a required report).6 The reports\nmust be filed no later than 10 days before an election, 20 days\nafter a primary election and 30 days after a general election;\nadditional reports must be filed on January 31 of every year\nand July 31 after an election year. See HRS § 11-336(a)–(d).\nIf a noncandidate committee has aggregate contributions and\nexpenditures of $1,000 or less in an election period, it need\nonly file a single, final election-period report, or it may\nsimply request to terminate its registration. See HRS §§ 11-\n326, 11-339(a).\n\n    A-1’s argument that these burdens are substantial is\nforeclosed by Human Life, which held that the burdens of\ncompliance with Washington State’s materially\nindistinguishable registration and reporting requirements\nwere “modest” and “not unduly onerous.” 624 F.3d at\n1013–14. Indeed, the majority of circuits have concluded that\nsuch disclosure requirements are not unduly burdensome.\nSee Sorrell, 758 F.3d at 137–38 (rejecting the argument that\n“registration, recordkeeping necessary for reporting, and\nreporting requirements” are onerous as a matter of law);\nWorley v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 717 F.3d 1238, 1250 (11th Cir.\n2013) (holding that Florida’s analogous “PAC regulations do\nnot generally impose an undue burden”); McKee, 649 F.3d at\n\n\n  6\n    The Hawaii Legislature slightly revised the reporting requirements\nafter the district court granted summary judgment to the Commission. See\n2013 Haw. Sess. Laws 209-10 (S.B. 31) (amending HRS §§ 11-335, 11-\n336). We consider the version of the reporting statutes in effect at the\ntime this suit was filed. In any event, the minor amendments do not affect\nour constitutional analysis.\n\f28              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n56 (holding that Maine’s analogous PAC regulations “do not\nprohibit, limit, or impose any onerous burdens on speech”);\nFamily PAC, 685 F.3d at 808 n.6 (noting the generally\n“modest” administrative burdens imposed on ballot\ncommittees by Washington law); Speechnow.org v. Fed.\nElection Comm’n, 599 F.3d 686, 697–98 (D.C. Cir. 2010)\n(holding that the organizational, administrative and\ncontinuous reporting requirements applicable to federal\npolitical committees were not unduly burdensome); Alaska\nRight to Life Comm. v. Miles, 441 F.3d 773, 789–92 (9th Cir.\n2006) (holding that registration, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to Alaskan political committees were\nnot “significantly burdensome” or “particularly onerous”).\n\n    A-1 would distinguish Human Life’s burden analysis on\nthe ground that a noncandidate committee in Hawaii is\nsubject to additional limits on the kinds of contributions it\nmay receive. Specifically, A-1 points to Hawaii law limiting\ncontributions to noncandidate committees (HRS § 11-358),\nand banning contributions from particular sources, including\nbans on contributions made in the name of another (HRS\n§ 11-352), anonymous contributions (HRS § 11-353), or\nprohibitions on contributions from government contractors\nand foreign nationals (HRS §§ 11-355, 11-356). These\ndifferences do not distinguish Human Life. First, because A-\n1 is self-financed and does not receive contributions, any\nfunding limits or bans have no bearing on our as-applied\nconstitutional analysis. Second, none of these limits imposes\na substantial burden. The Commission concedes that the only\nconstitutionally suspect limit A-1 identifies – the $1,000 limit\non contributions to noncandidate committees – is\nunconstitutional as applied to committees making only\nindependent expenditures. The other limits apply to A-1\nregardless of its status as a noncandidate committee. Thus,\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         29\n\nthere are no material differences between the burdens of\nnoncandidate committee status in Hawaii and political\ncommittee status in Washington.7\n\n    A-1 has been complying with the noncandidate committee\nrequirements for several years without difficulty. No separate\norganization need be created, as long as records are kept\ntracking financial activity by the noncandidate committee, see\nHAR § 3-160-21(c), and filing of the brief, required reports\nmay be performed electronically at infrequent intervals, see\nHRS § 11-336. As the district court concluded, “[a]lthough\nthe requirements might be inconvenient, the record does not\nindicate the burdens on A-1 are onerous as matters of fact or\nlaw.” Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1053.\n\n\n\n  7\n     The burdens of noncandidate committee status in Hawaii are also\ndistinguishable from the burdens of federal “PAC status” that A-1 labels\n“onerous,” citing to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Federal Election\nCommission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U.S.\n238, 248 (1986), and Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 337–39. The federal\nPAC status in MCFL required corporations to set up a separate legal entity\nand create a segregated fund before engaging in any direct political\nspeech, and further prohibited an organization from soliciting\ncontributions beyond its “members.” See McKee, 649 F.3d at 56; see also\nMadigan, 697 F.3d at 488 (distinguishing MCFL’s PAC burdens); Human\nLife, 624 F.3d at 1010 (same); Alaska Right to Life, 441 F.3d at 786–87,\n791–92 (same). But see Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc. v. Barland,\n751 F.3d 804, 839–42 (7th Cir. 2014) (describing the “heavy\nadministrative burdens” of Wisconsin’s analogous, but more detailed,\n“PAC-like disclosure program,” which “in critical respects [was]\nunchanged from Buckley’s day”). Like Maine’s political committee\nprovision, Hawaii law “imposes three simple obligations” on a qualifying\nentity that are not nearly as onerous as those considered in MCFL: “filing\nof a registration form disclosing basic information, . . . reporting of\nelection-related contributions and expenditures, and simple\nrecordkeeping.” McKee, 649 F.3d at 56.\n\f30             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n     Turning to the governmental interests side of the\nequation, there is no question that Hawaii’s noncandidate\ncommittee requirements serve important government\ninterests. The Hawaii legislature created these requirements\nto “expand the scope of public scrutiny relative to the\nfinancial aspects of the campaign process” and to avoid\ncorruption or its appearance in electoral politics. House\nStand. Comm. Rep. No. 188, H.B. No. 22, in Haw. H.J. 840\n(1973). Subsequent amendments to Hawaii’s disclosure\nscheme reaffirmed the important “informational value”\nserved by reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as\nthe state’s interest in“deterr[ing] . . . corruption” and\n“gathering data necessary to detect violations” of campaign\nfinance laws. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137,\n1140 (1979). When Hawaii revised its campaign finance\nlaws in 1995, the legislature cited the importance of\n“reforming the campaign spending law . . . to restor[e] the\npublic’s confidence in the political process.” S. Stand.\nComm. Rep. No. 1344, H.B. No. 2094, Haw. S.J. 1346\n(1995). The legislature found that “[m]aking candidates,\ncontributors, and others more accountable by requiring the\nfiling of reports . . . and specifying what information must\nappear in these reports go[es] a long way to accomplishing\nthese goals.” Id.\n\n     Thus, Hawaii’s noncandidate committee regulations serve\nall three interests that the Supreme Court has recognized as\n“important” in the context of reporting and disclosure\nrequirements: “providing the electorate with information,\ndeterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance\nthereof, and gathering the data necessary to enforce more\nsubstantive electioneering restrictions.” Canyon Ferry Rd.\nBaptist Church of E. Helena, Inc. v. Unsworth, 556 F.3d\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   31\n\n1021, 1031 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n196).\n\n    First, the reporting and disclosure obligations provide\ninformation to the electorate about who is speaking –\ninformation that “is vital to the efficient functioning of the\nmarketplace of ideas, and thus to advancing the democratic\nobjectives underlying the First Amendment.” Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1005; see also McCutcheon v. Fed. Election\nComm’n, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 1459–60 (2014); Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 368–69; Family PAC, 685 F.3d at 806, 808.\n“This transparency enables the electorate to make informed\ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and\nmessages,” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 371, making\ndisclosure of this information a “sufficiently important, if not\ncompelling, governmental interest,” Human Life, 624 F.3d at\n1005–06. Second, Hawaii’s reporting and disclosure\nobligations “deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance\nof corruption by exposing large contributions and\nexpenditures to the light of publicity.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n67; see also McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1459. Third, the\nregistration, record keeping, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements provide a means of detecting violations of valid\ncontribution limitations, preventing circumvention of\nHawaii’s campaign spending limitations, including rules that\nbar contributions by foreign corporations or individuals, see\nHRS § 11-356, or that prohibit contributions from\ngovernment contractors, see HRS § 11-355. See Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 67–68; Speechnow.org, 599 F.3d at 698 (holding\nthat “requiring disclosure . . . deters and helps expose\nviolations of other campaign finance restrictions”). Thus,\nHawaii’s noncandidate committee reporting and disclosure\nrequirements indisputably serve important governmental\ninterests.\n\f32              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    A-1 nonetheless contends these reporting and disclosure\nrequirements are not sufficiently tailored to survive exacting\nscrutiny because they apply to any organization that has “the\npurpose” of engaging in political advocacy, HRS § 11-302,\nrather than applying more narrowly to organizations having\na primary purpose of engaging in such activity. A-1\nconcedes that Hawaii may impose reporting and disclosure\nrequirements on organizations that make political advocacy\na priority but argues that it only incidentally engages in such\nadvocacy.\n\n    A-1’s argument rests on Human Life, which considered\nthe Washington disclosure regime whereby an organization\nqualifies as a political committee if its “primary or one of [its]\nprimary purposes is to affect, directly or indirectly,\ngovernmental decision making by supporting or opposing\ncandidates or ballot propositions.” 624 F.3d at 1008 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). First, Human Life\nrejected the argument that this definition was facially\noverbroad because “it covers groups with ‘a’ primary purpose\nof political advocacy, instead of being limited to groups with\n‘the’ primary purpose of political advocacy.” 624 F.3d at\n1008–11 (emphasis added). It explained that Buckley and\nFederal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for\nLife, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U.S. 238 (1986), did not hold that an\nentity must have the sole, major purpose of political advocacy\n“to be deemed constitutionally a political committee.”\nHuman Life, 624 F.3d at 1009–10 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S.\nat 79). Next, Human Life held that Washington’s political\ncommittee definition withstood exacting scrutiny because\nthere was “a substantial relationship between Washington\nState’s informational interest and its decision to impose\ndisclosure requirements on organizations with a primary\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  33\n\npurpose of political advocacy.” Id. at 1011. We reasoned\nthat the definition:\n\n       does not extend to all groups with “a purpose”\n       of political advocacy, but instead is tailored to\n       reach only those groups with a “primary”\n       purpose of political activity. This limitation\n       ensures that the electorate has information\n       about groups that make political advocacy a\n       priority, without sweeping into its purview\n       groups that only incidentally engage in such\n       advocacy. Under this statutory scheme, the\n       word “primary” – not the words “a” or “the”\n       – is what is constitutionally significant.\n\nId. at 1011 (emphasis added).\n\n    A-1 correctly points out that the provision at issue in\nHuman Life applied to organizations with a primary purpose\nof political advocacy, whereas Hawaii’s law applies to an\norganization with “the purpose” of political advocacy.\nHuman Life, however, did not “hold that the word ‘primary’\nor its equivalent [was] constitutionally necessary.” Id. It\nheld only that this limitation was “sufficient” for\nWashington’s political committee definition to withstand\nFirst Amendment scrutiny. Id. Human Life is therefore not\ncontrolling, and, reaching an issue we did not address there,\nwe conclude that Hawaii’s noncandidate committee reporting\nand disclosure requirements are sufficiently tailored as\napplied to A-1 even without a “primary” modifier.\n\n   First, because Hawaii’s definition extends only to\norganizations having “the purpose” of political advocacy, it\navoids reaching organizations engaged in only incidental\n\f34                 A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nadvocacy. Under the Commission’s narrowing construction,\nnoncandidate committee status applies to organizations that\nhave the purpose of making or receiving contributions, or\nmaking expenditures, for express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent. Cf. Madigan, 697 F.3d at 488 (holding that\nIllinois’ political committee definition’s “limit of ‘on behalf\nof or in opposition to’ confines the realm of regulated activity\nto expenditures and contributions within the core area of\ngenuinely campaign-related transactions”).8\n\n    Second, Hawaii’s registration and reporting requirements\nare not triggered until an organization makes more than\n$1,000 in aggregate contributions and expenditures during a\ntwo-year election period. See HRS § 11-321(g); HAR § 3-\n160-21(a). This threshold also ensures that an organization\nmust be more than incidentally engaged in political advocacy\nbefore it will be required to register and file reports as a\nnoncandidate committee. Third, an organization that “raises\nor expends funds for the sole purpose of producing and\ndisseminating informational or educational communications”\n– even if it also engages in limited political advocacy costing\nless than $1,000 in the aggregate – need not register as a\nnoncandidate committee. See HRS §§ 11-302; 11-321(g).\n\n\n  8\n    Hawaii’s definition is distinguishable from the Wisconsin regulation\nstruck down in Barland, 751 F.3d at 822, 834–37, which treated an\norganization as a political committee if it, inter alia, spent more than $300\nto communicate “almost anything . . . about a candidate within 30 days of\na primary and 60 days of a general election.” Hawaii’s more tailored\ndisclosure regime only extends to organizations with the purpose of\nengaging in express advocacy or its functional equivalent. See Sorrell,\n758 F.3d at 137–38 (distinguishing Barland and upholding Vermont’s\npolitical committee regime, which applied only to groups that accepted\ncontributions and made expenditures over $1,000 “for the purpose of\nsupporting or opposing one or more candidates”).\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         35\n\nFourth, if an organization registers as a noncandidate\ncommittee, but subsequently reduces its advocacy activity\nbelow the $1,000 threshold, it need only file a single report\nper election period or can terminate its registration. HRS\n§ 11-339.9\n\n    Given these limits and the extent of A-1’s past and\nplanned political advocacy, we have little trouble concluding\nthat the regulations are constitutional as applied to A-1. A-1,\nwhich made more than $50,000 in contributions and spent\nmore than $6,000 on political ads in 2010, clearly engages in\nmore than incidental political advocacy. Although A-1 now\npledges to limit its individual contributions to $250 and to\ncontribute only to candidates, these proposed activities –\ncombined with A-1’s expenditures on its political ads –\n\n\n 9\n    The reporting requirements of Hawaii law are more narrowly tailored\nthan the “onerous” and “potentially perpetual” reporting requirement\npreliminary enjoined in Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v.\nSwanson, 692 F.3d 864, 873–74 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc). In Minnesota,\nan organization must register as a political committee once it spends $100\nin the aggregate on political advocacy, and once registered, it must “file\nfive reports during a general election year” even if the committee makes\nno further expenditures. Id. at 873, 876; see also Iowa Right to Life\nComm., Inc. v. Tooker, 717 F.3d 576, 596–98 (8th Cir. 2013) (striking\ndown Iowa’s ongoing reporting requirements that were untethered to any\nfuture political spending). We do not agree that such reporting\nrequirements are “onerous” as a general matter. See Human Life, 624 F.3d\nat 1013–14. Moreover, unlike in Minnesota, an organization need not\nregister as a noncandidate committee in Hawaii until it crosses the $1,000\nthreshold for a two-year election cycle, see HRS § 11-321(g), and a\ncommittee with aggregate contributions and expenditures of $1,000 or less\nin any subsequent election cycle need only file a single, final election-\nperiod report, see HRS § 11-326. Hawaii’s reporting regime is thus\ncontingent on an organization’s ongoing contributions and expenditures,\nreflecting its closer tailoring to Hawaii’s informational interest than\nMinnesota’s analogous regime.\n\f36             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nplainly exceed incidental activity. Hawaii thus has a strong\ninterest in regulating A-1.\n\n    Hawaii’s choice of a $1,000 registration and reporting\nthreshold is also a far cry from the zero dollar threshold\ninvalidated in Canyon Ferry, 556 F.3d at 1033–34. See also\nWorley, 717 F.3d at 1251 (noting that “federal PAC\nrequirements kick in once a group has raised $1000 during a\ncalendar year to influence elections and . . . these\nrequirements have not been held unconstitutional” (citing\n1 U.S.C. § 431(4)(a) (2012))). Although we carefully\nscrutinize the constitutionality of a legislature’s chosen\nthreshold for imposing registration and reporting\nrequirements, see Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 248–49\n(2006) (plurality opinion), the precise “line is necessarily a\njudgmental decision, best left in the context of this complex\nlegislation to [legislative] discretion,” Family PAC, 685 F.3d\nat 811 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 83); see also Worley,\n717 F.3d at 1253 (“Challengers are free to petition the\nlegislature to reset the reporting requirements for Florida’s\nPAC regulations, but we decline to do so here.”). At least as\napplied to A-1, Hawaii’s $1,000 threshold adequately ensures\nthat political committee burdens are not imposed on “groups\nthat only incidentally engage” in political advocacy. Human\nLife, 624 F.3d at 1011.\n\n    A-1’s argument that regulations should reach only\norganizations with a primary purpose of political advocacy\nalso ignores the “fundamental organizational reality that most\norganizations do not have just one major purpose.” Human\nLife, 624 F.3d at 1011 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Large organizations that spend only one percent of\ntheir funds on political advocacy likely have many other,\nmore important purposes – but this small percentage could\n\f                    A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                37\n\namount to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in political\nactivity, depending on the size of the organization. See id.;\nsee also Madigan, 697 F.3d at 489–90; McKee, 649 F.3d at\n59. The $1,000 threshold appropriately reaches these\nmultipurpose organizations’ participation in the political\nprocess.\n\n    A-1’s political advocacy underscores this point. Although\nA-1’s political spending may be limited in proportion to its\noverall activities, the strength of Hawaii’s informational\ninterest does not fluctuate based on the diversity of the\nspeaker’s activities. Hawaii has an interest in ensuring the\npublic can follow the money in an election cycle, regardless\nof whether it comes from a single-issue, political advocacy\norganization or a for-profit corporation such as A-1. The\nCommission makes the reported information freely available\nin searchable databases on its website, which provides\nHawaiians with a vital window into the flow of campaign\ndollars.10 This prompt, electronic disclosure of contributions\nand expenditures “can provide . . . citizens with the\ninformation needed to hold corporations and elected officials\naccountable for their positions and supporters,” Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 370, and “given the Internet, disclosure\noffers much more robust protections against corruption,”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1460. Thus, the distinction\nbetween A-1, a for-profit electrical contractor, and a group\nlike Human Life of Washington, a “nonprofit, pro-life\nadvocacy corporation,” 624 F.3d at 994, is not\nconstitutionally significant here. A-1 may not make political\nadvocacy a priority, but it nonetheless has been a significant\nparticipant in Hawaii’s electoral process, justifying the state’s\nimposition of registration and reporting burdens.\n\n 10\n      See http://ags.hawaii.gov/campaign/nc/.\n\f38             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    Furthermore, Hawaii’s noncandidate committee\ndefinition, by extending beyond organizations making\npolitical advocacy a priority, avoids the circumvention of\nvalid campaign finance laws and disclosure requirements.\nSee Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1011–12. As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained:\n\n       [L]imiting disclosure requirements to groups\n       with the major purpose of influencing\n       elections would allow even those very groups\n       to circumvent the law with ease. Any\n       organization dedicated primarily to electing\n       candidates or promoting ballot measures\n       could easily dilute that major purpose by just\n       increasing its non-electioneering activities or\n       better yet by merging with a sympathetic\n       organization that engaged in activities\n       unrelated to campaigning.\n\nMadigan, 697 F.3d at 489. Hawaii’s definition addresses the\n“hard lesson of circumvention” in the campaign finance\narena, by including within its reach any entity that has\npolitical advocacy as one of its goals. McConnell, 540 U.S.\nat 165. As the district court explained:\n\n       [A-1] has purposely not created a separate\n       organizational structure for election-related\n       activity, choosing instead to register itself (A-\n       1 A-Lectrician, Inc.) as a noncandidate\n       committee. If it were allowed to avoid\n       registration merely because its political\n       activity is small proportionally to its overall\n       activities (as an electrical contractor and\n       perhaps as a pure issue advocacy\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                           39\n\n         organization), it would encourage any\n         affiliated noncandidate committee to avoid\n         disclosure requirements by merging its\n         activities into a larger affiliated organization.\n\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1052 (citation omitted).11\n\n    In sum, the noncandidate committee definition and\naccompanying reporting and disclosure requirements are\nsubstantially related to Hawaii’s important interests in\ninforming the electorate, preventing corruption or its\nappearance, and avoiding the circumvention of valid\ncampaign finance laws. Because the burden of complying\nwith this disclosure scheme is modest compared to the\nsignificance of the interests being served, we uphold Hawaii’s\nnoncandidate committee reporting and disclosure\nrequirements as applied to A-1.\n\n    In doing so on an as-applied basis, we have no occasion\nto consider whether Hawaii law would withstand exacting\nscrutiny as applied to another business or nonprofit group that\nseeks to engage in less substantial political advocacy than A-\n1. We decline to “speculate about ‘hypothetical’ or\n\n\n  11\n     Although not directly relevant to A-1’s challenge – because A-1’s\npolitical activities are self-financed and it receives no contributions – we\nalso note the heightened importance of noncandidate committee disclosure\nrequirements now that the limit on contributions to noncandidate\ncommittees has been permanently enjoined. A single contributor may\nprovide thousands of dollars to independent committees, and yet avoid\ndisclosing its identity if the committee makes all the expenditures itself.\nThe noncandidate committee definition acts to ensure that the\ncontributor’s identity will be disclosed to the voting public. Hawaii’s\nefforts to provide transparency would be incomplete if disclosure was not\nrequired in such circumstances.\n\f40                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n‘imaginary’ cases.” Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State\nRepublican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450 (2008). Based on the\nrecord before us, we hold only that noncandidate committee\nstatus may be extended to organizations, such as A-1, even\nthough their primary purpose is not political advocacy. The\nburdens attending such a status are modest and substantially\nrelated to important government interests.\n\n B. The Disclaimer Requirement for Advertisements is\n         Constitutional Under Citizens United\n\n    A-1 contends that Hawaii’s requirement that political\nadvertising include a disclaimer as to the affiliation of the\nadvertiser with a candidate or candidate committee cannot\nsurvive exacting scrutiny. “Advertisements” for purposes of\nHawaii election law are print and broadcast communications\nthat (1) identify a candidate or ballot issue directly or by\nimplication and (2) “advocate[] or support[] the nomination,\nopposition, or election of the candidate, or advocate[] the\npassage or defeat of the issue or question on the ballot.” HRS\n§ 11-302. The challenged disclaimer rule provides that an\nadvertisement must include a “notice in a prominent location”\nthat “[t]he advertisement has the approval and authority of the\ncandidate” or “has not been approved by the candidate.”\nHRS § 11-391(a)(2).12, 13 The rule thus advises voters\nwhether an advertisement is coordinated with or independent\n\n\n  12\n     A-1 does not challenge the related requirement that all political\nadvertisements disclose the name and address of the person or entity\npaying for the ad. See HRS § 11-391(a)(1).\n 13\n    This provision was amended during the pendency of this appeal, but\nthe minor changes are immaterial. See 2014 Hawaii Laws Act 128 (H.B.\n452).\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   41\n\nfrom a candidate for elected office. The fine for violating this\nsection is $25 per advertisement, not to exceed $5,000 in the\naggregate. See HRS § 11-391(b).\n\n    A-1 seeks to place advertisements that (1) mention a\ncandidate by name; (2) run in close proximity to an election;\nand (3) include language stating that particular candidates\n“are representatives who do not listen to the people,” “do not\nunderstand the importance of the values that made our nation\ngreat” or “do not show the aloha spirit.” It argues the\ndisclaimer requirement is unconstitutional because it\nregulates the content of speech itself and is therefore an even\ngreater incursion on its First Amendment rights than\nreporting requirements. A-1 further contends a disclaimer\ncan be mandated only for speech that is a federal\nelectioneering communication, as defined by federal law, or\nthat is express advocacy, not including its functional\nequivalent.\n\n    We agree with the district court that the disclaimer\nrequirement survives exacting scrutiny as applied to A-1’s\nnewspaper advertisements. Like the noncandidate committee\nrequirements, the disclaimer serves an important\ngovernmental interest by informing the public about who is\nspeaking in favor or against a candidate before the election\nand imposes only a modest burden on First Amendment\nrights. A-1’s arguments to the contrary are all but foreclosed\nby Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–69.\n\n    First, the disclaimer requirement imposes only a modest\nburden on A-1’s First Amendment rights. Like disclosure\nrequirements, “[d]isclaimer . . . requirements may burden the\nability to speak, but they impose no ceiling on campaign-\nrelated activities and do not prevent anyone from speaking.”\n\f42              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nId. at 366 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nHawaii’s disclaimer requirement is no more burdensome than\nthe one for televised electioneering communications upheld\nin Citizens United. See id. at 366–69. That rule required a\nstatement as to who was responsible for the content of the\nadvertisement “be made in a ‘clearly spoken manner,’ and\ndisplayed on the screen in a ‘clearly readable manner’ for at\nleast four seconds,” along with a further statement that “the\ncommunication ‘is not authorized by any candidate or\ncandidate’s committee.’” Id. at 366 (quoting 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441d(d)(2), (a)(3)). Similarly, all that is required here is a\nshort statement stating that the advertisement is published,\nbroadcast, televised, or circulated with or without the\napproval and authority of the candidate. See HRS § 11-\n391(a).\n\n    Second, requiring a disclaimer is closely related to\nHawaii’s important governmental interest in “dissemination\nof information regarding the financing of political messages.”\nMcKee, 649 F.3d at 61. A-1’s past advertisements ran shortly\nbefore an election and criticized candidates by name as\npersons who did not, for example, “listen to the people.” As\nthe district court found, these advertisements – published on\nor shortly before election day – are not susceptible to any\nreasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote\nagainst a candidate. Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1055.\nSuch ads are the very kind for which “the public has an\ninterest in knowing who is speaking,” Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 369, and where disclaimers can “avoid confusion\nby making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or\npolitical party,” id. at 368. See also Worley, 717 F.3d at\n1253–55 (rejecting a challenge to an analogous disclaimer\nrequirement); McKee, 649 F.3d at 61 (same); Alaska Right to\nLife, 441 F.3d at 792–93 (same).

SNIPES                            43\n\nargument, nothing in Citizens United suggests that a state\nmay not require disclaimers for political advertising that is\nnot the functional equivalent of a federal electioneering\ncommunication.       In applying the federal disclaimer\nrequirement to an advertisement urging voters to see a short\nfilm about a presidential candidate, Citizens United explained\nthat “[e]ven if the ads only pertain to a commercial\ntransaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.”\n558 U.S. at 369.14\n\n   Accordingly, the disclaimer requirement does not violate\nthe First Amendment as applied to A-1’s political\nadvertisements.\n\n\n\n\n   14\n      We reject A-1’s comparison to the disclaimer invalidated by the\nSupreme Court in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334,\n340 (1995), which prohibited the distribution of pamphlets without the\nname and address of the person responsible for the materials, or to the\ndisclosure provision invalidated by this court in ACLU of Nev. v. Heller,\n378 F.3d 979, 981–82 (9th Cir. 2004), which required persons paying for\npublication of any material “relating to an election” to include their names\nand addresses. Citizens United’s post-McIntyre, post-Heller discussion\nmakes clear that disclaimer laws such as Hawaii’s may be imposed on\npolitical advertisements that discuss a candidate shortly before an election.\nSee 558 U.S. at 368–69; see also Worley, 717 F.3d at 1254 (rejecting the\nargument that McIntyre dictated the demise of Florida’s analogous\ndisclaimer requirement).

SNIPES\n\nC. A-1 Lacks Standing to Challenge the Electioneering\n     Communications Reporting Requirements\n\n    A-1 acknowledges that, at the time it filed this action, it\nlacked standing to challenge the electioneering\ncommunications law if it must continue to register as a\nnoncandidate committee. See Washington Envtl. Council v.\nBellon, 732 F.3d 1131, 1139 (9th Cir. 2013) (“A plaintiff\nmust demonstrate standing for each claim he or she seeks to\npress and for each form of relief sought.” (citing\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)).\nA-1 argues, however, that it now has standing because\nHawaii law was amended as of November 5, 2014, to require\nregistered noncandidate committees to comply with\nelectioneering communications reporting requirements. See\n2013 Haw. Sess. L. Act 112. But, “[s]tanding is determined\nas of the commencement of litigation.” Biodiversity Legal\nFound. v. Badgley, 309 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir. 2002); see\nalso Wilbur v.

The Contractor Contribution Ban is Constitutional\n Even As Applied to Contributions to Legislators Who\n        Neither Award nor Oversee Contracts\n\n    A-1’s final First Amendment challenge is to Hawaii’s ban\non contributions by government contractors. The challenged\nprovision makes it\n\n        unlawful for any person who enters into any\n        contract with the State, any of the counties, or\n        any department or agency thereof either for\n        the rendition of personal services, the buying\n        of property, or furnishing of any material,\n        supplies, or equipment to the State, any of the\n        counties, any department or agency thereof, or\n        for selling any land or building to the State,\n        any of the counties, or any department or\n        agency thereof, if payment for the\n        performance of the contract or payment for\n        material, supplies, equipment, land, property,\n        or building is to be made in whole or in part\n        from funds appropriated by the legislative\n        body, at any time between the execution of\n\n\n   15\n      Nothing we say today (other than as a matter of stare decisis)\nprecludes A-1 from bringing a future challenge to the electioneering\ncommunication reporting requirements to which, it claims, it is now\nsubject.\n\f46                 A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V.

Instead, A-1 asserts it intends to\nmake contributions only to lawmakers or candidates who will\nneither award nor oversee its contracts, and it argues the\ngovernment contractor contribution ban is unconstitutional\nsolely as applied to those intended contributions.16\n\n   Contribution bans are subject to “closely drawn” scrutiny.\nSee Fed. Election Comm’n v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146,\n161–63 (2003) (applying the closely drawn standard in\nupholding a federal law banning campaign contributions\nmade by corporations); Thalheimer v. City of San Diego,\n645 F.3d 1109, 1124 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2011) (applying closely\n\n 16\n    A-1 challenges only its right to make contributions to state legislative\ncandidates while acting as a state government contractor. It does not\ndistinctly argue, for example, that § 11-355(a) impermissibly infringes its\nright to contribute to county or municipal officials while serving as a state\ncontractor. We therefore have no occasion to decide whether the ban\nwould survive First Amendment scrutiny as applied to those\ncircumstances.\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                          47\n\ndrawn scrutiny to a city ordinance making it unlawful for\n“non-individuals” to contribute directly to candidates). A\nregulation satisfies closely drawn scrutiny when “the State\ndemonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs\nmeans closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of\nassociational freedoms.” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).17\n\n    A-1 does not argue that Hawaii’s government contractor\ncontribution ban is unconstitutional as a general matter. The\nSecond Circuit confronted a similar ban in Green Party of\nConnecticut v. Garfield, 616 F.3d 189 (2d Cir. 2010). There,\nthe court turned away a First Amendment challenge to\nConnecticut’s ban on campaign contributions by state\ncontractors, holding that it furthered a “‘sufficiently\nimportant’ government interest[]” by “combat[ing] both\nactual corruption and the appearance of corruption caused by\ncontractor contributions.” Id. at 200. The court further held\nthat the ban was “closely drawn” because it targeted\ncontributions by current and prospective state contractors –\nthe contributions associated most strongly with actual and\nperceived corruption. See id. at 202. Recognizing a ban on\n\n\n  17\n     We previously noted that Beaumont and other cases applying the\nclosely drawn standard to contribution limits remained good law after\nCitizens United. See Thalheimer, 645 F.3d at 1124–25. This remains true\nafter McCutcheon.        There, the Supreme Court considered the\nconstitutionality of “aggregate limits” under federal law, which\n“restrict[ed] how much money a donor [could] contribute in total to all\ncandidates or committees” in a given election period. See 134 S. Ct. at\n1442 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3)). Because the Court held that the\naggregate limit for federal elections failed even under less stringent,\n“closely drawn” scrutiny, the Court declined to revisit the proper standard\nof review for contribution limits. See id. at 1445–46.\n\f48              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\ncontributions by government contractors, rather than a mere\nlimit on the amount of those contributions, was “a drastic\nmeasure,” the court held that the ban was closely drawn\nbecause it addressed a perception of corruption brought about\nby recent government-contractor-related corruption scandals\nin Connecticut. See id. at 193–94, 204–05. The ban\n“unequivocally addresses the perception of corruption”\nbecause, “[b]y totally shutting off the flow of money from\ncontractors to state officials, it eliminates any notion that\ncontractors can influence state officials by donating to their\ncampaigns.” Id. at 205; see also Ognibene v. Parkes,\n671 F.3d 174, 185 (2d Cir. 2011) (“When the appearance of\ncorruption is particularly strong due to recent scandals . . . a\nban may be appropriate.”).\n\n    The same reasoning applies here. Hawaii’s government\ncontractor contribution ban serves sufficiently important\ngovernmental interests by combating both actual and the\nappearance of quid pro quo corruption. Green Party,\n616 F.3d at 200; see also McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1450\n(reaffirming that a legislature may limit contributions to\nprevent actual quid pro quo corruption or its appearance); cf.\nPreston v. Leake, 660 F.3d 726, 736–37 (4th Cir. 2011)\n(upholding a complete ban on contributions by lobbyists “as\na prophylactic to prevent not only actual corruption but also\nthe appearance of corruption in future state political\ncampaigns”). It is closely drawn because it targets direct\ncontributions from contractors to officeholders and\ncandidates, the contributions most closely linked to actual and\nperceived quid pro quo corruption. See Green Party,\n616 F.3d at 202; see also McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1452\n(noting that the “risk of quid pro quo corruption or its\nappearance” is greatest when “a donor contributes to a\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                          49\n\ncandidate directly”).18 And as in Connecticut, Hawaii’s\ndecision to adopt an outright ban rather than mere restrictions\non how much contractors could contribute was justified in\nlight of past “pay to play” scandals and the widespread\nappearance of corruption that existed at the time of the\nlegislature’s actions. See Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at\n1058–59 nn. 26–27 (summarizing the evidence of past\nscandals and the perception of corruption). Thus, as a general\nmatter, Hawaii’s ban on contributions by government\ncontractors satisfies closely drawn scrutiny.\n\n    A-1’s narrower argument that the contractor contribution\nban is unconstitutional as applied to its contributions to\nlawmakers and candidates who neither award nor oversee its\ncontracts is also without merit. Hawaii’s interest in\npreventing actual or the appearance of quid pro quo\ncorruption is no less potent as applied to A-1’s proposed\ncontributions because the Hawaii legislature as a whole\nconsiders all bills concerning procurement. Thus, although\nan individual legislator may not be closely involved in\nawarding or overseeing a particular contract, state money can\n\n  18\n    Hawaii’s contractor contribution ban is narrower than many others.\nThe ban upheld in Green Party, for example, applied not only to\ncontractors but also to principals of that contractor and to family members\nof a contractor or of a principal of a contractor. See Green Party,\n616 F.3d at 202–03. The federal ban is also broader than the Hawaii ban;\nit applies not only to existing contractors but also to prospective\ncontractors. See 2 U.S.C. § 441c. Hawaii’s law does not prohibit A-1\nfrom making contributions as a prospective contractor, A-1’s principals\n(such as plaintiff Yamada) from making contributions or A-1 from making\nindependent expenditures on behalf of the candidates it seeks to support.\nCf. Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 161 n.8 (“A ban on direct corporate\ncontributions leaves individual members of corporations free to make their\nown contributions, and deprives the public of little or no material\ninformation.”).\n\f50              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nbe spent only with an appropriation by the entire legislature.\nSee Haw. Const. art. VII, §§ 5, 9. Hawaii reasonably\nconcluded that contributions to any legislator could give rise\nto the appearance of corruption.\n\n    In essence, A-1 contends that Hawaii’s contractor ban\nshould be tailored more narrowly, but narrower tailoring is\nnot required here. There is no question the ban is closely\ndrawn to the state’s anticorruption interest as a general\nmatter, and we decline to revisit the legislature’s judgment\nnot to craft a still narrower provision. Closely drawn scrutiny\nrequires “a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable,”\nand Hawaii’s contractor contribution ban is a reasonable\nresponse to the strong appearance of corruption that existed\nat the time of the legislature’s actions. McCutcheon, 134 S.\nCt. at 1456 (quoting Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We need not “determine with any degree of\nexactitude the precise restriction necessary to carry out the\nstatute’s legitimate objectives” to uphold the contribution\nban. Randall, 548 U.S. at 248.\n\n     Even if narrower tailoring were required, A-1’s proposal\nfor a narrower ban is unworkable. A-1 does not explain how\nit would determine, before the election, which candidates\nwould neither award nor oversee any of its contracts. The\nmembership of the various legislative committees can change\nwith each election, and a different committee – whether the\nEducation Committee or Public Safety, Government\nOperations, and Military Affairs Committee – may serve a\ngreater or lesser oversight role on a particular project. There\nis, therefore, a “clear fallacy” in A-1’s logic:\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   51\n\n       [During the 2011 Legislative Session], A-1\n       testified . . . in favor of a construction and\n       procurement-related bill regarding the\n       University of Hawaii.          At least three\n       Legislators that served on committees that\n       considered the bill (and voted in favor of it)\n       also received campaign contributions from A-\n       1 in the 2010 elections. And A-1 made\n       contributions to opponents of fifteen other\n       Legislators who considered the bill.\n\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1061 n.30 (citation omitted).\nSimply put, A-1 cannot predict with certainty which\ncandidates will not become involved in the contract award or\noversight process when it makes its contributions. Moreover,\nA-1’s contributions to candidates who do not become directly\ninvolved in contract award and oversight could still create the\nappearance of “the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political\nfavors.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359 (quoting Fed.\nElection Comm’n v. Nat’l Conservative Political Action\nComm., 470 U.S. 480, 497 (1985)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n   For these reasons, we hold that Hawaii’s government\ncontractor contribution ban survives closely drawn scrutiny\neven as applied to A-1’s proposed contributions to candidates\nwho neither decide whether A-1 receives contracts nor\noversee A-1’s contracts.\n\n                    IV. Attorney’s Fees\n\n   Finally, we consider the district court’s fee award to\nYamada and Stewart (the plaintiffs) for their successful\nconstitutional challenge to the $1,000 limit on contributions\n\f52              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nto noncandidate committees, HRS § 11-358. Under\n41 U.S.C. § 1988(b), the district court had discretion to award\n“the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee.” We\nreview the award for an abuse of discretion, but any element\nof legal analysis that figures into the district court’s decision\nis reviewed de novo. See Watson v. Cnty. of Riverside,\n300 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir. 2002). The plaintiffs’ primary\ncontention, with which we agree, is that the district court\nerred by refusing to award the fees they incurred in\nsuccessfully defending against the defendants’ interlocutory\nappeal. We address the plaintiffs’ other contentions in a\nconcurrently filed memorandum disposition.\n\n    In October 2010, the district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction in favor of the plaintiffs on their claim that HRS\n§ 11-358, limiting to $1,000 contributions to noncandidate\ncommittees, violates the First Amendment. The defendants\nthen filed an interlocutory appeal. After the parties finished\nbriefing in this court, however, the defendants dismissed the\nappeal, presumably in light of an intervening decision\nupholding a preliminary injunction of a similar contribution\nlimit. See Thalheimer, 645 F.3d at 1117–21. In subsequent\ndistrict court proceedings, the defendants offered to stipulate\nto a permanent injunction against § 11-358. The parties,\nhowever, were unable to reach agreement on the form of an\ninjunction, and on the parties’ subsequent cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, the district court permanently enjoined\n§ 11-358 as applied to the plaintiffs’ proposed contributions.\n\n    Based on their successful constitutional challenge to § 11-\n358, Yamada and Stewart sought attorney’s fees and costs,\nincluding those fees incurred in defending against the\ndefendants’ interlocutory appeal, under § 1988. The district\ncourt granted in part and denied in part their fee request. As\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   53\n\nrelevant here, it concluded it had “no authority” to award fees\npertaining to the interlocutory appeal because (1) the\nplaintiffs became prevailing parties when the defendants\nabandoned their appeal of the preliminary injunction, see\nWatson, 300 F.3d at 1095 (stating that, under certain\ncircumstances, “a plaintiff who obtains a preliminary\ninjunction is a prevailing party for purposes of § 1988”), and\n(2) under Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6 and Cummings v.\nConnell, 402 F.3d 936, 940 (9th Cir. 2005) (Cummings II),\n“[a] district court is not authorized to award attorney’s fees\nfor an appeal unless we transfer the fee request to the district\ncourt for consideration.” Because it assumed the plaintiffs\ncould have requested fees from the Ninth Circuit as\nprevailing parties when the defendants dismissed their appeal,\nthe court concluded it had no authority to award fees for the\nappeal.\n\n    The plaintiffs contend, and we agree, that the district\ncourt’s analysis was flawed for two reasons. First, contrary\nto the district court’s analysis, Yamada and Stewart were not\nyet prevailing parties when the defendants dismissed their\ninterlocutory appeal and could not have requested fees at that\ntime. A court may award attorney’s fees under § 1988 only\nto a “prevailing party,” and a plaintiff prevails for purposes\nof § 1988 only “when actual relief on the merits of his claim\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\nmodifying the defendant’s behavior in a way that directly\nbenefits the plaintiff.” Higher Taste, Inc. v. City of Tacoma,\n717 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby,\n506 U.S. 103, 111–12 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This requires an “enduring” change in the parties’\nrelationship, Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 86 (2007), that has\n“‘judicial imprimatur’ . . . such as a judgment on the merits\nor a court-ordered consent decree,” Watson, 300 F.3d at 1096\n\f54                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n(quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t\nof Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 600 (2001)).\n\n    The district court concluded that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing parties under Watson, but Watson is\ndistinguishable. As explained in Higher Taste, Watson stands\nfor the proposition that, “when a plaintiff wins a preliminary\ninjunction and the case is rendered moot before final\njudgment, either by the passage of time or other\ncircumstances beyond the parties’ control, the plaintiff is a\nprevailing party eligible for a fee award.” Higher Taste,\n717 F.3d at 717 (emphasis added). Here, the plaintiffs’\nchallenge to HRS § 11-358 was not “rendered moot” until the\ndistrict court entered final judgment against the Commission\non that claim. A plaintiff does not become a prevailing party\nuntil it obtains relief that is “no longer subject to being\n‘reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final\ndecision in the same case.’” Id. (quoting Sole, 551 U.S. at\n83). Here, that occurred when the district court entered a\nfinal judgment on the plaintiffs’ § 11-358 claim, not when the\nCommission abandoned its appeal of the adverse preliminary\ninjunction ruling.19\n\n   The defendants argue Yamada and Stewart were\nnonetheless prevailing parties at the time the defendants\ndismissed their interlocutory appeal because the preliminary\n\n     19\n       Higher Taste extended Watson’s prevailing party analysis to\ncircumstances in which a plaintiff obtains a preliminary injunction and\nthen the case is dismissed upon the parties’ stipulation following\nsettlement, when the settlement agreement provides the plaintiff with\n“what it had hoped to obtain through a permanent injunction.” 717 F.3d\nat 717–18. Here, however, the parties did not reach a settlement\nagreement at the time of the preliminary injunction appeal or any time\nthereafter.\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  55\n\ninjunction issued by the district court was not an “ephemeral”\nvictory at all, but “a published opinion, resolving a\nconstitutional question, enjoining a campaign finance law\nweeks before an election.” That the preliminary injunction\nwould be converted into a permanent one appeared to be a\n“foregone conclusion” to the parties and the district court,\nparticularly once we issued our decision in Thalheimer.\n\n    We disagree. Because the preliminary injunction order\ncould be negated by a final decision on the merits, it was an\ninterlocutory order that did not confer prevailing party status\non the plaintiffs when the defendants dismissed their appeal.\n\n    Furthermore, because the plaintiffs were not yet\nprevailing parties when the defendants dismissed the\ninterlocutory appeal, the district court erred by relying on\nCummings II to deny them attorney’s fees for the appeal.\nCummings II was the second appeal before this court in a case\nproceeding under § 1983. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the plaintiffs in the underlying case, and the\ndefendant appealed that final order. In Cummings v. Connell,\n316 F.3d 886, 898–99 (9th Cir. 2003) (Cummings I), we\nupheld the grant of summary judgment as to the defendant’s\nliability, thus preserving the plaintiffs’ status as prevailing\nparties on the merits, but remanded for reconsideration of\ndamages. On remand, the district court awarded an additional\n$30,000 in attorney’s fees the plaintiffs had incurred\ndefending against the defendant’s prior appeal in Cummings\nI. Cummings II, 402 F.3d at 942, 947. The parties cross-\nappealed again. We held that the fees related to the first\nappeal were improperly awarded “because plaintiffs failed to\nfile their request with the court of appeals as required by\nNinth Circuit Rule 39-1.6.” Id. at 947. In short,\n\f56                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n           [p]laintiffs’ application for attorneys’ fees and\n           expenses incurred on appeal in Cummings I\n           should have been filed with the Clerk of the\n           Ninth Circuit. Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.8\n           authorizes us to transfer a timely-filed\n           fees-on-appeal request to the district court for\n           consideration, but the decision to permit the\n           district court to handle the matter rests with\n           the court of appeals. In the absence of such a\n           transfer, the district court was not authorized\n           to rule on the request for appellate attorney’s\n           fees.\n\nId. at 947–48.20 See Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Winter,\n543 F.3d 1152, 1164 (9th Cir. 2008) (“In Cummings [II], we\nheld that appellate fees requested pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1988 must be filed with the Clerk of the Ninth Circuit in the\nfirst instance, not with the district court.”). Accordingly, we\nreversed the attorney’s fees award for the first appeal, holding\nthat the plaintiffs’ request for fees was untimely. See\nCummings II, 402 F.3d at 948.\n\n  20\n       Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6(a) reads:\n\n           Absent a statutory provision to the contrary, a request\n           for attorneys’ fees shall be filed no later than 14 days\n           after the expiration of the period within which a petition\n           for rehearing may be filed, unless a timely petition for\n           rehearing is filed. If a timely petition for rehearing is\n           filed, the request for attorneys fees shall be filed no\n           later than 14 days after the Court’s disposition of the\n           petition.\n\nThis amended version of Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6 omits the “shall be\nfiled with the Clerk” language of the prior version, but as the district court\ncorrectly concluded, the amendment did not alter the substance of the rule.\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                           57\n\n     Cummings II, however, did not consider a situation in\nwhich a party prevails on interlocutory review and only\nsubsequently becomes entitled to attorney’s fees under a fee-\nshifting statute such as § 1988. When a plaintiff is not\nentitled to attorney’s fees after an interlocutory appeal, as was\nthe case here, it cannot immediately request attorney’s fees\nfrom this court. Should the plaintiff subsequently become a\nprevailing party, however, it should presumptively be eligible\nfor attorney’s fees incurred during the first appeal, because\nthat appeal likely contributed to the success of the underlying\nlitigation. See Crumpacker v. Kansas, Dep’t of Human Res.,\n474 F.3d 747, 756 (10th Cir. 2007) (Title VII) (holding that\n“parties who prevail on interlocutory review in this court, and\nwho subsequently become prevailing parties . . . are implicitly\nentitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees related to the\ninterlocutory appeal”); cf. Cabrales v. Cnty. of L.A., 935 F.2d\n1050, 1053 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that “a plaintiff who is\nunsuccessful at a stage of litigation that was a necessary step\nto her ultimate victory is entitled to attorney’s fees even for\nthe unsuccessful stage”).\n\n    Here, because Yamada and Stewart prevailed in an\ninterlocutory appeal, and subsequently became prevailing\nparties after the district court entered judgment in their favor,\nthe district court erred by failing to consider whether to award\nthem reasonable appellate attorney’s fees. We hold that\nYamada and Stewart are entitled to attorney’s fees arising\nfrom the prior appeal. The matter is referred to the Ninth\nCircuit Appellate Commissioner to determine the amount of\nfees to be awarded.21\n\n\n 21\n    The plaintiffs further argue Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6 cannot restrict\nthe jurisdiction of the district court to award attorney’s fees related to a\nprior appeal where a fee-shifting statute, such as § 1988, does not preclude\n\f58                 A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n                            V. Conclusion\n\n    We affirm the judgment of the district court on the merits\nof A-1’s constitutional claims. We vacate the district court’s\nfee award to Yamada and Stewart in part and refer the matter\nto the Ninth Circuit Appellate Commissioner for a\ndetermination of the proper fee award arising out of the\ninterlocutory appeal. Each party shall bear its own costs on\nappeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART;\nREFERRED TO THE APPELLATE COMMISSIONER\nWITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\nthe district court from awarding such fees. The Eighth Circuit agreed with\nthis position in Little Rock School District v. State of Arkansas, 127 F.3d\n693, 696 (8th Cir. 1997), where it held that, despite an analogous Eighth\nCircuit rule to our Rule 39-1.6, “the district courts retain jurisdiction to\ndecide attorneys’ fees issues that we have not ourselves undertaken to\ndecide.” Although the plaintiffs’ argument has some appeal, we are bound\nby our contrary holding in Cummings II.\n\f",

It also purchased three newspaper\nadvertisements. As a result of these expenditures and\ncontributions, A-1 was required to register as a “noncandidate\ncommittee,” and was subjected to reporting and disclosure\nrequirements (HRS § 11-302) and advertising disclaimer\nrequirements (HRS § 11-391). A1, which plans to run similar\nadvertisements and make similar contributions to candidates\nin the future, objects to both the disclaimer requirement and\nthe noncandidate committee registration and reporting\nrequirements.\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f4               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    Addressing A-1's Fourteenth Amendment due process\nvagueness challenge to Hawaii’s reporting and disclosure\nrequirements, the panel held that HRS § 11-302’s definitions\nof “expenditure,” and “noncandidate committee” were not\nvague given the narrowing construction of the term\n“influence” proffered by Hawaii’s Campaign Spending\nCommission. The panel also held that § 11-302’s definition\nof “advertisement” was not unconstitutionally vague because\nread as a whole and in context it was sufficiently clear to give\na person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to\nknow what was prohibited.\n\n    Addressing the First Amendment challenges, the panel\nheld that the registration, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements that Hawaii places on “noncandidate\ncommittees” survived exacting scrutiny as applied to A-1.\nThe panel held that the requirements were substantially\nrelated to Hawaii’s important interests in informing the\nelectorate, preventing corruption or its appearance, and\navoiding the circumvention of valid campaign finance laws.\nThe panel also held that Hawaii’s requirement that political\nadvertising include a disclaimer as to the affiliation of the\nadvertiser with a candidate or candidate committee did not\nviolate the First Amendment as applied to A-1’s political\nadvertisements.\n\n   The panel declined to consider A1’s challenge to\nHawaii’s electioneering communication reporting\nrequirements (HRS § 341) because it determined that A-1\nwas not subject to those requirements as of the date the\ncomplaint was filed.\n\n  The panel rejected A-1’s First Amendment challenge to\nHawaii’s ban on campaign contributions by government\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V.

The panel held that Hawaii’s government\ncontractor contribution ban survived closely drawn scrutiny\neven as applied to A-1’s proposed contributions to candidates\nwho neither decide whether A-1 receives contracts nor\noversee A-1’s contracts.\n\n    The panel held that the individual plaintiffs were entitled\nto attorney’s fees arising from their prior interlocutory appeal\nchallenging HRS § 11-358, which prohibited any person from\nmaking contributions to a noncandidate committee in an\naggregate amount greater than $1,000 in an election. The\npanel held that because plaintiffs prevailed in the\ninterlocutory appeal, and subsequently became prevailing\nparties after the district court entered judgment in their favor,\nthe district court erred by failing to consider whether to award\nthem reasonable appellate attorney’s fees.

Background\n\n    The plaintiffs are Jimmy Yamada, Russell Stewart and A-\n1. Before the 2010 general election, Yamada and Stewart\neach sought to contribute $2,500 to the Aloha Family\nAlliance–Political Action Committee (AFA-PAC), a\nregistered “noncandidate committee” that makes independent\ncampaign expenditures in Hawaii elections. They were\nforbidden from doing so, however, by Hawaii Revised Statute\n(HRS) § 11-358, which prohibits any person from “mak[ing]\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  7\n\ncontributions to a noncandidate committee in an aggregate\namount greater than $1,000 in an election.”\n\n    Plaintiff A-1 is a Hawaii electrical-construction\ncorporation that makes campaign contributions and engages\nin political speech. Yamada is its CEO. During the 2010\nelection, A-1 contributed over $50,000 to candidates,\ncandidate committees and party committees. It also\npurchased three newspaper advertisements at a cost of $2,000\nto $3,000 each. Under the heading “Freedom Under Siege,”\nthese advertisements declared that Hawaiians had “lost our\nfreedom” because “we have representatives who do not listen\nto the people.” One advertisement asserted State House\nMajority Leader Blake Oshiro and other representatives were\n“intent on the destruction of the family.” Another accused\nOshiro and his colleagues of “disrespect[ing] the legislative\nprocess and the people.” In accordance with Hawaii law, see\nHRS § 11-391(a)(2)(B), all three advertisements included a\ndisclaimer that they were “[p]ublished without the approval\nand authority of the candidate.”\n\n    As a result of these expenditures and contributions,\nHawaii law required A-1 to register as a “noncandidate\ncommittee” as defined by HRS § 11-302. Section 11-302\nimposes reporting and disclosure requirements on any\norganization that has “the purpose of making or receiving\ncontributions, making expenditures, or incurring financial\nobligations to influence [elections]” over $1,000 in the\naggregate for an election cycle. Id.; see HRS § 11-321(g).\nA-1, which plans to run similar advertisements and to make\nsimilar contributions to candidates in the future, objects to\nboth the disclaimer requirement and the noncandidate\ncommittee registration and reporting requirements.\n\f8                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    If A-1 is relieved of the obligation of registering as a\nnoncandidate committee, it could be subject to reporting\nrequirements associated with “electioneering\ncommunications” because it seeks to publish newspaper\nadvertisements that mention candidates by name shortly\nbefore an election. See HRS § 11-341. Every entity that\nmakes a disbursement for an electioneering communication,\nsuch as A-1’s newspaper advertisements, must report certain\nidentifying information to the Commission within 24 hours of\ncertain disclosure dates. See id. Under the regulations in\neffect when A-1 filed this action, if A-1 were to remain a\nnoncandidate committee, however, it would not have to file\nan electioneering communications report or comply with the\nprovisions of HRS § 11-341. See Haw. Admin. Rule (HAR)\n§ 3-160-48.1\n\n   Finally, A-1 is often a state government contractor, and\nwhen it has such contracts, Hawaii law prohibits it from\nmaking campaign contributions to candidates or candidate\ncommittees. See HRS § 11-355. A-1 challenges that\nprohibition as applied to its speech, although it declares it\nseeks to contribute only to lawmakers who neither award nor\noversee its public contracts.\n\n    Shortly before the 2010 primary election, Yamada,\nStewart and A-1 filed a nine-count complaint challenging the\nconstitutionality of five provisions of Hawaii campaign\nfinance law. Yamada and Stewart challenged the $1,000\nlimit on contributions to noncandidate committees, HRS\n§ 11-358, and A-1 challenged four other provisions: (1) the\n\n\n    1\n    On November 5, 2014, an amendment to HRS § 11-341 went into\neffect, requiring registered noncandidate committees to file electioneering\ncommunications statements.

SNIPES\n\n    Yamada and Stewart sought their attorney’s fees under\n41 U.S.C. § 1988 based on their successful constitutional\nchallenge to the $1,000 contribution limit. The district court\nawarded them $60,152.65 in fees and $3,623.29 in costs.\nYamada and Stewart appeal that award in several respects,\nincluding the district court’s denial of the fees they incurred\ndefending against the defendants’ abandoned appeal of the\npreliminary injunction ruling.\n\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and review\nA-1’s constitutional challenges de novo. See Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1000. A-1 raises three groups of issues on\nappeal: (1) whether the expenditure, noncandidate committee\nand advertisement definitions are unconstitutionally vague;\n(2) whether the noncandidate committee definition and\nadvertising disclaimer and electioneering communications\nreporting requirements impose unconstitutional burdens on\nspeech; and (3) whether the ban on contributions by\ngovernment contractors is unconstitutional as applied to A-\n1’s proposed contributions. Yamada and Stewart also appeal\nthe partial denial of attorney’s fees. We address these issues\nin turn.\n\n          II. Due Process Vagueness Challenge\n\n    We begin by addressing A-1’s argument that § 11-302’s\ndefinitions of “expenditure,” “noncandidate committee” and\n“advertisement” are unconstitutionally vague under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Section 11-302 defines\nan “expenditure” to include:\n\n       (1) Any purchase or transfer of money or\n       anything of value, or promise or agreement to\n       purchase or transfer money or anything of\n       value, or payment incurred or made, or the use\n       or consumption of a nonmonetary\n       contribution for the purpose of:\n\n           (A) Influencing the nomination for\n           election, or the election, of any person\n           seeking nomination for election or\n           election to office, whether or not the\n           person has filed the person’s nomination\n           papers;\n\n           (B) Influencing the outcome of any\n           question or issue that has been certified to\n           appear on the ballot at the next applicable\n           election . . . .\n\nHRS § 11-302 (emphasis added). It defines a “noncandidate\ncommittee” as:\n\n       [A]n organization, association, party, or\n       individual that has the purpose of making or\n       receiving contributions, making expenditures,\n       or incurring financial obligations to influence\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  13\n\n       the nomination for election, or the election, of\n       any candidate to office, or for or against any\n       question or issue on the ballot . . . .\n\nId. (emphasis added). Noncandidate committees are Hawaii’s\nversion of independent expenditure committees, similar to the\nWashington “political committee” definition we addressed in\nHuman Life. See 624 F.3d at 997.\n\n    A-1 challenges these definitions under Buckley v. Valeo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (1976) (per curiam), which held that the terms\n“influencing” and “for the purpose of influencing” were\nunconstitutionally vague when used to delineate types of\nspeech subject to regulation. Id. at 77–82. If both definitions\nare unconstitutionally vague, Hawaii cannot constitutionally\nimpose noncandidate committee status and the accompanying\nregistration and reporting burdens on A-1.\n\n    Like the district court, we assume without deciding that\nthe term “influence” may be vague under some\ncircumstances. “Conceivably falling within the meaning of\n‘influence’ are objectives as varied as advocacy for or against\na candidate’s election; championing an issue for inclusion in\na candidate’s platform; and encouraging all candidates to\nembrace public funding.” Nat’l Org. for Marriage v.

But the Commission has\noffered and the district court applied a limiting construction\non the term “influence” in § 11-302’s definitions of\n“expenditure” and “noncandidate committee,” eliminating\nthis potential vagueness.         Under the Commission’s\ninterpretation, “influence” refers only to “communications or\nactivities that constitute express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent.” This interpretation significantly narrows the\nstatutory language, because “express advocacy” requires\n\f14              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V.

Given the substantial similarity between\nthe statutory language in Buckley and the language at issue\nhere, the Commission’s gloss is entirely reasonable.\nCompare 2 U.S.C. § 431(f) (1971), with HRS § 11-302.\n\n    Moreover, the Commission reasonably construes the\nstatute as referring not only to express advocacy but also to\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  15\n\nits functional equivalent. After Buckley, case law and Federal\nElection Commission regulations have broadened the concept\nof express advocacy to include its “functional equivalent,” as\ndefined in Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U.S. at 469–70.

Elsewhere, Hawaii’s\nCommission has adopted a regulation defining express\nadvocacy with reference to its functional equivalent, or as\ncommunications that are “susceptible to no other reasonable\ninterpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a\ncandidate.” HAR § 3-160-6. The Commission’s proposed\nconstruction is consistent with Buckley, subsequent Supreme\nCourt decisions, federal regulations and other Commission\nregulations. The proposed construction, therefore, is neither\nunreasonable nor foreclosed by the plain language of the\nstatute. See Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc. v.

In 1979, the Hawaii\nlegislature revised state campaign finance laws to harmonize\nthem with Buckley. See 1979 Haw. Sess. L. Act 224; Conf.\nComm. Rep. No. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137, 1140 (1979). The\nlegislature was “mindful” that Buckley “narrowly construed\nthe operation of the federal spending and contribution\n\f16                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\ndisclosure requirements” to encompass only\n“communications that expressly advocate the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Conf. Comm. Rep.\nNo. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137, 1140 (1979). Thus, as the district\ncourt concluded, “[i]t is reasonable to infer . . . that Hawaii’s\nLegislature adopted terminology such as ‘to influence’ in\nreliance on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the same\nterminology in federal law.” Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at\n1046. We agree.2\n\n     A-1 nonetheless contends we should not adopt the\nnarrowing construction because it would not bind a state\ncourt and therefore provides insufficient protection for First\nAmendment values. We again disagree. By adopting a\n“‘readily apparent’ constitutional interpretation,” we provide\nA-1 and other parties not before the court “sufficient\nprotection from unconstitutional application of the statute, as\nit is quite likely nonparty prosecutors and state courts will\napply the same interpretation.” Planned Parenthood of\nIdaho, Inc. v.

See, e.g., Kapiolani Park\nPres. Soc’y v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377263\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377263/kapiolani-park-pres-soc-v-honolulu/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1028 (Haw.\n1988) (“Legislative acts . . . are not to be held invalid, or unconstitutional,\n\f                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V.

We therefore adopt\nit.\n\n                                  2.\n\n    We also reject A-1’s argument that § 11-302’s definitions\nof “expenditure” and “noncandidate committee” are\nunconstitutionally vague even with this limiting construction\nin place. With the narrowing gloss, these definitions are\nsufficiently precise to provide “a person of ordinary\nintelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.” Williams,\n553 U.S. at 304. Only expenditures for communications that\nexpressly advocate for a candidate or are “susceptible of no\nreasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for\nor against a specific candidate” can trigger noncandidate\ncommittee registration, reporting and disclosure requirements\nunder § 11-302. There is no dispute that “express advocacy”\nis not a vague term, and the controlling opinion in Wisconsin\nRight to Life held the “functional equivalent” or “appeal to\nvote” component of this test also meets the “imperative for\nclarity” that due process requires. 551 U.S. at 474 n.7. That\nclose cases may arise in applying this test does not make it\nunconstitutional, given there will always be an inherent but\npermissible degree of uncertainty in applying any standards-\nbased test. See Williams, 553 U.S. at 306 (“Close cases can\nbe imagined under virtually any statute.”); Real Truth,\n681 F.3d at 554–55. We therefore join the First, Fourth and\nTenth Circuits in holding that the “appeal to vote” language\n\n\nor unconscionable, if such a construction can reasonably be avoided.”).\nWe would therefore expect Hawaii courts to adopt the same limiting\nconstruction.\n\f18              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V.

Wisconsin Right to Life sustained the functional\nequivalent test against a vagueness challenge to the federal\ndefinition of electioneering communications, which covers\nonly broadcast communications, see 551 U.S. at 474 n.7; 2\nU.S.C. § 434(f)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), whereas Hawaii’s\nnoncandidate committee and expenditure definitions extend\nto speech in printed form, see HRS § 11-302. The statute at\nissue in Wisconsin Right to Life also regulated only\ncommunications run shortly before an election, whereas\nHawaii’s statute applies to communications without strict\ntemporal limitations. But these differences are immaterial.\nRegardless of when a communication is aired or printed and\nwhether it appears in print or in a broadcast medium, the\npurveyor of the advertisement has fair notice that the\nregulations reach only those ads that clearly advocate for an\nidentified candidate. Like the Fourth Circuit, we hold that the\nfunctional equivalent language is not unconstitutionally vague\nmerely because it applies more broadly than the federal\nprovision upheld in Wisconsin Right to Life. See Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Tennant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280–81\n(4th Cir. 2013).\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  19\n\n    Second, the validity of the functional equivalent test has\nnot been undermined by Citizens United, which struck down\nthe federal electioneering communication definition, see\n1 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3), for which the test was first developed.\nAs the First Circuit explained in rejecting an identical\nargument:\n\n       The basis for Citizens United’s holding on the\n       constitutionality of the electioneering\n       expenditure statute had nothing to do with the\n       appeal-to-vote test . . . . Instead, the decision\n       turned on a reconsideration of prior case law\n       holding that a corporation’s political speech\n       may be subjected to greater regulation than an\n       individual’s. The opinion offered no view on\n       the clarity of the appeal-to-vote test. In fact,\n       the Court itself relied on the appeal-to-vote\n       test in disposing of a threshold argument that\n       the appeal should be resolved on narrower, as-\n       applied grounds.\n\nMcKee, 649 F.3d at 69 (citations omitted); see also Nat’l Org.\nfor Marriage v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2472419\"><a href=\"/opinion/2472419/national-organization-for-marriage-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We also have relied on the appeal to vote test,\nalbeit in dicta, since Citizens United. See Human Life,\n624 F.3d at 1015. We could not have done so if the test was\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n    Accordingly, we sustain Hawaii’s noncandidate\ncommittee and expenditure definitions from A-1’s vagueness\nchallenges. The term “influence” is readily and reasonably\ninterpreted to encompass only “communications or activities\n\f20              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nthat constitute express advocacy or its functional equivalent.”\nAs construed, the definitions are not unconstitutionally vague.\n\n        B. Hawaii’s Advertising Definition is Not\n              Unconstitutionally Vague\n\n    A-1 argues that § 11-302’s advertising definition is\nunconstitutionally vague because it uses the terms\n“advocates,” “supports” and “opposition.” This provision\nspells out when an advertisement must include a disclaimer\nas to whether the ad was disseminated with or without the\napproval of a candidate. See HRS § 11-391. In relevant part,\nHawaii law defines an “advertisement” as:\n\n       any communication, excluding sundry items\n       such as bumper stickers, that:\n\n           (1) Identifies a candidate directly or by\n           implication, or identifies an issue or\n           question that will appear on the ballot at\n           the next applicable election; and\n\n           (2) Advocates or supports the nomination,\n           opposition, or election of the candidate, or\n           advocates the passage or defeat of the\n           issue or question on the ballot.\n\nHRS § 11-302 (emphasis added).\n\n   Applying a narrowing construction to this definition, as\nbefore, the district court limited the reach of “advocates or\nsupports the nomination, opposition, or election of the\ncandidate” to express advocacy or its functional equivalent.\nSee Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1054. With this limiting\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                    21\n\nconstruction, the district court concluded that Hawaii’s\ndefinition of an advertisement was not unconstitutionally\nvague. A-1 contends that the district court impermissibly\nadopted a limiting construction for the same reasons it argues\na limiting construction was inappropriate for the\nnoncandidate committee and expenditure definitions. It\nfurther argues that with or without the limiting construction,\nthe challenged definition is unconstitutionally vague under\nBuckley and McConnell v.

The Commission responds that\nthe definition is not vague even without a limiting\nconstruction.\n\n    We agree with the Commission that Hawaii’s advertising\ndefinition is sufficiently precise without a limiting\nconstruction and therefore decline to adopt one. The words\n“advocates or supports” and “opposition” as used here are\nsubstantially similar to the words “promote,” “oppose,”\n“attack” and “support” that survived a vagueness challenge in\nMcConnell. There, the Court considered a statute defining\n“Federal election activity” as “a public communication that\nrefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office . . .\nand that promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or\nattacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of\nwhether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or\nagainst a candidate).” 2 U.S.C. § 431(20)(A)(iii). The Court\nnoted that “[t]he words ‘promote,’ ‘oppose,’ ‘attack,’ and\n‘support’ clearly set forth the confines within which potential\nparty speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the\nprovision.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. Because\n“[t]hese words ‘provide explicit standards for those who\napply them’ and ‘give the person of ordinary intelligence a\nreasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,’” the\n\f22                  A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nCourt held that the provision was not unconstitutionally\nvague. Id. (quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108–09).4\nMcConnell supports the conclusion that Hawaii’s\nadvertisement definition is not unconstitutionally vague.\n\n     Decisions in other circuits also support that conclusion.\nIn McKee, the First Circuit turned away a vagueness\nchallenge to a Maine law using the terms “promoting,”\n“support” and “opposition” in several campaign finance\nprovisions. The terms were not impermissibly vague because\nthey were tied to an “election-related object” – either\n“candidate,” “nomination or election of any candidate” or\n“campaign.” McKee, 649 F.3d at 64. Maine’s expenditure\nstatute, for example, “instructs that reports submitted\npursuant to the provision ‘must state whether the expenditure\nis in support of or in opposition to the candidate.’” Id. at 63\nn.41 (quoting Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 21-A, § 1019-B(3)(B)). The\nSecond, Fourth and Seventh Circuits have reached similar\nconclusions.

SNIPES                   23\n\n    As in McKee, Hawaii’s statutes are tied to an election-\nrelated object – the terms “advocates,” “supports” and\n“opposition” refer only to “the nomination . . . or election of\nthe candidate.” HRS § 11-302. So too does the federal law\nupheld in McConnell, which used the words “promote,”\n“oppose,” “attack” and “support” only in relation to a “clearly\nidentified candidate for Federal office.”            2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(20)(A)(iii). Although the terms “advocate,” “support”\nand “opposition” may not, in isolation, offer sufficient clarity\nas to what advertisements must include a disclaimer, their\nproximity to “nomination” or “election of the candidate”\nmake clear the sort of campaign-related advertising for which\na disclaimer must be included. Read as a whole and in\ncontext, the advertisement definition is sufficiently clear to\n“give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.” Grayned, 408 U.S.\nat 108.\n\n    Finally, we reject A-1’s argument that “advocates,” a term\nthat McConnell did not consider, makes Hawaii’s advertising\ndefinition unconstitutionally vague. A-1 relies on Buckley,\nwhich considered a provision that prohibited any person or\ngroup from making “any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly\nidentified candidate during a calendar year which, when\nadded to all other expenditures . . . advocating the election or\ndefeat of such candidate, exceeds $1,000.” 424 U.S. at 42.\nBuckley held that this provision – which imposed a severe\nrestriction on independent spending by all individuals and\ngroups other than political parties and campaign\norganizations – was impermissibly vague because of its\npotential breadth, extending to the discussion of public issues\nuntethered from particular candidates. See id. at 40, 42. The\nCourt therefore construed the provision “to apply only to\nexpenditures for communications that in express terms\n\f24              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate for federal office.” Id. at 44.\n\n    A-1’s contention that “advocates” is unconstitutionally\nvague in this context does not survive the Supreme Court’s\npost-Buckley discussion of nearly identical language in\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. For candidate elections,\nHawaii’s definition uses the word “advocates” only in\nrelation to a communication that (1) identifies a candidate and\n(2) “advocates or supports the nomination, opposition, or\nelection of [that] candidate.” HRS § 11-302. Although the\nword “advocates” was not at issue in McConnell, there is\nnothing unconstitutionally vague about “advocate” when used\nin Hawaii’s advertising definition to refer to communications\nthat identify a candidate for state office and “plead in favor\nof” that candidate’s election. Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 32 (2002). A-1’s vagueness\nchallenge to the Hawaii advertising definition therefore fails.\n\n              III. First Amendment Claims\n\n    A-1 brings First Amendment challenges to (1) the\nregistration, reporting and disclosure requirements that\nHawaii places on “noncandidate committees” and (2) the\nrequirement that political advertisements include a disclaimer\nstating whether they are broadcast or published with the\napproval of a candidate. Because the challenged laws provide\nfor the disclosure and reporting of political spending but do\nnot limit or ban contributions or expenditures, we apply\nexacting scrutiny. See Family PAC v.

The Noncandidate Committee Reporting and\nDisclosure Requirements Survive Exacting Scrutiny As\n                   Applied to A-1\n\n    We first consider whether the noncandidate committee\nreporting and disclosure requirements satisfy exacting\nscrutiny as applied to A-1. Looking to the burden side of the\nbalance, the district court found that the “registration and\ndisclosure requirements that come with noncandidate\ncommittee status do not present an undue burden on A-1.”\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1052. We agree.\n\n    The noncandidate committee is Hawaii’s method for\nmonitoring and regulating independent political spending in\nstate elections. In relevant part, a noncandidate committee is\nbroadly defined as an organization “that has the purpose of\nmaking or receiving contributions, making expenditures, or\nincurring financial obligations to influence” Hawaii elections.\nHRS § 11-302.5 To paraphrase the statute, and incorporating\nthe Commission’s narrowing construction we adopted earlier\n(see page 20), the noncandidate committee definition is\nlimited to an organization that:\n\n\n\n 5\n   Although noncandidate committee status also extends to an individual\nwho makes contributions or expenditures not of his or her own funds, see\nHRS § 11-302, the parties focus solely on noncandidate committee status\nfor organizations, and we shall do the same.\n\f26              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n       Has “the purpose” of making or receiving\n       contributions, or making expenditures, for\n       communications or activities that constitute\n       express advocacy or its functional equivalent\n       (i.e., that are susceptible of no reasonable\n       interpretation other than as an appeal to vote\n       for or against a specific candidate to office, or\n       for or against any question or issue on the\n       ballot).\n\nExpenditures are further defined as payments or nonmonetary\ncontributions made for the purpose of communications or\nactivities that constitute express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent. See id.; HRS § 11-302.\n\n    Noncandidate committee status is triggered only when an\norganization receives contributions or makes or incurs\nqualifying expenditures totaling more than $1,000 during a\ntwo-year election cycle. See HRS § 11-321(g). Within 10\ndays of reaching this threshold, the organization must register\nas a noncandidate committee by filing an organizational\nreport with the Commission. Id. In addition to registering,\nthe organization must file an organizational report, designate\nofficers, disclose its bank account information, and designate\na treasurer responsible for recording contributions and\nexpenditures and maintaining records for five years. See\nHRS §§ 11-321, 11-323, 11-324, 11-351(a). The committee’s\ncontributions must be segregated from its other funds. See\nHAR § 3-160-21(c).\n\n    Every committee must also comply with reporting\nrequirements tied to election periods. These requirements\ninclude disclosing contributions made and received,\nexpenditures by the committee and the assets on hand at the\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         27\n\nend of the reporting period. See HRS §§ 11-331 (filing of\nreports), 11-335 (noncandidate committee reports), 11-336\n(timing of reports for noncandidate committees), 11-340\n(penalties for failure to file a required report).6 The reports\nmust be filed no later than 10 days before an election, 20 days\nafter a primary election and 30 days after a general election;\nadditional reports must be filed on January 31 of every year\nand July 31 after an election year. See HRS § 11-336(a)–(d).\nIf a noncandidate committee has aggregate contributions and\nexpenditures of $1,000 or less in an election period, it need\nonly file a single, final election-period report, or it may\nsimply request to terminate its registration. See HRS §§ 11-\n326, 11-339(a).\n\n    A-1’s argument that these burdens are substantial is\nforeclosed by Human Life, which held that the burdens of\ncompliance with Washington State’s materially\nindistinguishable registration and reporting requirements\nwere “modest” and “not unduly onerous.” 624 F.3d at\n1013–14. Indeed, the majority of circuits have concluded that\nsuch disclosure requirements are not unduly burdensome.\nSee Sorrell, 758 F.3d at 137–38 (rejecting the argument that\n“registration, recordkeeping necessary for reporting, and\nreporting requirements” are onerous as a matter of law);\nWorley v.

Specifically, A-1 points to Hawaii law limiting\ncontributions to noncandidate committees (HRS § 11-358),\nand banning contributions from particular sources, including\nbans on contributions made in the name of another (HRS\n§ 11-352), anonymous contributions (HRS § 11-353), or\nprohibitions on contributions from government contractors\nand foreign nationals (HRS §§ 11-355, 11-356). These\ndifferences do not distinguish Human Life. First, because A-\n1 is self-financed and does not receive contributions, any\nfunding limits or bans have no bearing on our as-applied\nconstitutional analysis. Second, none of these limits imposes\na substantial burden. The Commission concedes that the only\nconstitutionally suspect limit A-1 identifies – the $1,000 limit\non contributions to noncandidate committees – is\nunconstitutional as applied to committees making only\nindependent expenditures. The other limits apply to A-1\nregardless of its status as a noncandidate committee. Thus,\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         29\n\nthere are no material differences between the burdens of\nnoncandidate committee status in Hawaii and political\ncommittee status in Washington.7\n\n    A-1 has been complying with the noncandidate committee\nrequirements for several years without difficulty. No separate\norganization need be created, as long as records are kept\ntracking financial activity by the noncandidate committee, see\nHAR § 3-160-21(c), and filing of the brief, required reports\nmay be performed electronically at infrequent intervals, see\nHRS § 11-336. As the district court concluded, “[a]lthough\nthe requirements might be inconvenient, the record does not\nindicate the burdens on A-1 are onerous as matters of fact or\nlaw.” Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1053.\n\n\n\n  7\n     The burdens of noncandidate committee status in Hawaii are also\ndistinguishable from the burdens of federal “PAC status” that A-1 labels\n“onerous,” citing to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Federal Election\nCommission v.

Like Maine’s political committee\nprovision, Hawaii law “imposes three simple obligations” on a qualifying\nentity that are not nearly as onerous as those considered in MCFL: “filing\nof a registration form disclosing basic information, . . . reporting of\nelection-related contributions and expenditures, and simple\nrecordkeeping.” McKee, 649 F.3d at 56.\n\f30             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n     Turning to the governmental interests side of the\nequation, there is no question that Hawaii’s noncandidate\ncommittee requirements serve important government\ninterests. The Hawaii legislature created these requirements\nto “expand the scope of public scrutiny relative to the\nfinancial aspects of the campaign process” and to avoid\ncorruption or its appearance in electoral politics. House\nStand. Comm. Rep. No. 188, H.B. No. 22, in Haw. H.J. 840\n(1973). Subsequent amendments to Hawaii’s disclosure\nscheme reaffirmed the important “informational value”\nserved by reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as\nthe state’s interest in“deterr[ing] . . . corruption” and\n“gathering data necessary to detect violations” of campaign\nfinance laws. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 78, in Haw. H.J. 1137,\n1140 (1979). When Hawaii revised its campaign finance\nlaws in 1995, the legislature cited the importance of\n“reforming the campaign spending law . . . to restor[e] the\npublic’s confidence in the political process.” S. Stand.\nComm. Rep. No. 1344, H.B. No. 2094, Haw. S.J. 1346\n(1995). The legislature found that “[m]aking candidates,\ncontributors, and others more accountable by requiring the\nfiling of reports . . . and specifying what information must\nappear in these reports go[es] a long way to accomplishing\nthese goals.” Id.\n\n     Thus, Hawaii’s noncandidate committee regulations serve\nall three interests that the Supreme Court has recognized as\n“important” in the context of reporting and disclosure\nrequirements: “providing the electorate with information,\ndeterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance\nthereof, and gathering the data necessary to enforce more\nsubstantive electioneering restrictions.” Canyon Ferry Rd.\nBaptist Church of E.

Second, Hawaii’s reporting and disclosure\nobligations “deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance\nof corruption by exposing large contributions and\nexpenditures to the light of publicity.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n67; see also McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1459. Third, the\nregistration, record keeping, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements provide a means of detecting violations of valid\ncontribution limitations, preventing circumvention of\nHawaii’s campaign spending limitations, including rules that\nbar contributions by foreign corporations or individuals, see\nHRS § 11-356, or that prohibit contributions from\ngovernment contractors, see HRS § 11-355. See Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 67–68; Speechnow.org, 599 F.3d at 698 (holding\nthat “requiring disclosure . . . deters and helps expose\nviolations of other campaign finance restrictions”). Thus,\nHawaii’s noncandidate committee reporting and disclosure\nrequirements indisputably serve important governmental\ninterests.\n\f32              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    A-1 nonetheless contends these reporting and disclosure\nrequirements are not sufficiently tailored to survive exacting\nscrutiny because they apply to any organization that has “the\npurpose” of engaging in political advocacy, HRS § 11-302,\nrather than applying more narrowly to organizations having\na primary purpose of engaging in such activity. A-1\nconcedes that Hawaii may impose reporting and disclosure\nrequirements on organizations that make political advocacy\na priority but argues that it only incidentally engages in such\nadvocacy.\n\n    A-1’s argument rests on Human Life, which considered\nthe Washington disclosure regime whereby an organization\nqualifies as a political committee if its “primary or one of [its]\nprimary purposes is to affect, directly or indirectly,\ngovernmental decision making by supporting or opposing\ncandidates or ballot propositions.” 624 F.3d at 1008 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). First, Human Life\nrejected the argument that this definition was facially\noverbroad because “it covers groups with ‘a’ primary purpose\nof political advocacy, instead of being limited to groups with\n‘the’ primary purpose of political advocacy.” 624 F.3d at\n1008–11 (emphasis added). It explained that Buckley and\nFederal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for\nLife, Inc. (MCFL), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), did not hold that an\nentity must have the sole, major purpose of political advocacy\n“to be deemed constitutionally a political committee.”\nHuman Life, 624 F.3d at 1009–10 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S.\nat 79). Next, Human Life held that Washington’s political\ncommittee definition withstood exacting scrutiny because\nthere was “a substantial relationship between Washington\nState’s informational interest and its decision to impose\ndisclosure requirements on organizations with a primary\n\f               A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  33\n\npurpose of political advocacy.” Id. at 1011. We reasoned\nthat the definition:\n\n       does not extend to all groups with “a purpose”\n       of political advocacy, but instead is tailored to\n       reach only those groups with a “primary”\n       purpose of political activity. This limitation\n       ensures that the electorate has information\n       about groups that make political advocacy a\n       priority, without sweeping into its purview\n       groups that only incidentally engage in such\n       advocacy. Under this statutory scheme, the\n       word “primary” – not the words “a” or “the”\n       – is what is constitutionally significant.\n\nId. at 1011 (emphasis added).\n\n    A-1 correctly points out that the provision at issue in\nHuman Life applied to organizations with a primary purpose\nof political advocacy, whereas Hawaii’s law applies to an\norganization with “the purpose” of political advocacy.\nHuman Life, however, did not “hold that the word ‘primary’\nor its equivalent [was] constitutionally necessary.” Id. It\nheld only that this limitation was “sufficient” for\nWashington’s political committee definition to withstand\nFirst Amendment scrutiny. Id. Human Life is therefore not\ncontrolling, and, reaching an issue we did not address there,\nwe conclude that Hawaii’s noncandidate committee reporting\nand disclosure requirements are sufficiently tailored as\napplied to A-1 even without a “primary” modifier.\n\n   First, because Hawaii’s definition extends only to\norganizations having “the purpose” of political advocacy, it\navoids reaching organizations engaged in only incidental\n\f34                 A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nadvocacy. Under the Commission’s narrowing construction,\nnoncandidate committee status applies to organizations that\nhave the purpose of making or receiving contributions, or\nmaking expenditures, for express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent. Cf. Madigan, 697 F.3d at 488 (holding that\nIllinois’ political committee definition’s “limit of ‘on behalf\nof or in opposition to’ confines the realm of regulated activity\nto expenditures and contributions within the core area of\ngenuinely campaign-related transactions”).8\n\n    Second, Hawaii’s registration and reporting requirements\nare not triggered until an organization makes more than\n$1,000 in aggregate contributions and expenditures during a\ntwo-year election period. See HRS § 11-321(g); HAR § 3-\n160-21(a). This threshold also ensures that an organization\nmust be more than incidentally engaged in political advocacy\nbefore it will be required to register and file reports as a\nnoncandidate committee. Third, an organization that “raises\nor expends funds for the sole purpose of producing and\ndisseminating informational or educational communications”\n– even if it also engages in limited political advocacy costing\nless than $1,000 in the aggregate – need not register as a\nnoncandidate committee. See HRS §§ 11-302; 11-321(g).\n\n\n  8\n    Hawaii’s definition is distinguishable from the Wisconsin regulation\nstruck down in Barland, 751 F.3d at 822, 834–37, which treated an\norganization as a political committee if it, inter alia, spent more than $300\nto communicate “almost anything . . . about a candidate within 30 days of\na primary and 60 days of a general election.” Hawaii’s more tailored\ndisclosure regime only extends to organizations with the purpose of\nengaging in express advocacy or its functional equivalent. See Sorrell,\n758 F.3d at 137–38 (distinguishing Barland and upholding Vermont’s\npolitical committee regime, which applied only to groups that accepted\ncontributions and made expenditures over $1,000 “for the purpose of\nsupporting or opposing one or more candidates”).\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                         35\n\nFourth, if an organization registers as a noncandidate\ncommittee, but subsequently reduces its advocacy activity\nbelow the $1,000 threshold, it need only file a single report\nper election period or can terminate its registration. HRS\n§ 11-339.9\n\n    Given these limits and the extent of A-1’s past and\nplanned political advocacy, we have little trouble concluding\nthat the regulations are constitutional as applied to A-1. A-1,\nwhich made more than $50,000 in contributions and spent\nmore than $6,000 on political ads in 2010, clearly engages in\nmore than incidental political advocacy. Although A-1 now\npledges to limit its individual contributions to $250 and to\ncontribute only to candidates, these proposed activities –\ncombined with A-1’s expenditures on its political ads –\n\n\n 9\n    The reporting requirements of Hawaii law are more narrowly tailored\nthan the “onerous” and “potentially perpetual” reporting requirement\npreliminary enjoined in Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v.\nSwanson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873–74 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc).

We do not agree that such reporting\nrequirements are “onerous” as a general matter. See Human Life, 624 F.3d\nat 1013–14. Moreover, unlike in Minnesota, an organization need not\nregister as a noncandidate committee in Hawaii until it crosses the $1,000\nthreshold for a two-year election cycle, see HRS § 11-321(g), and a\ncommittee with aggregate contributions and expenditures of $1,000 or less\nin any subsequent election cycle need only file a single, final election-\nperiod report, see HRS § 11-326. Hawaii’s reporting regime is thus\ncontingent on an organization’s ongoing contributions and expenditures,\nreflecting its closer tailoring to Hawaii’s informational interest than\nMinnesota’s analogous regime.\n\f36             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nplainly exceed incidental activity. Hawaii thus has a strong\ninterest in regulating A-1.\n\n    Hawaii’s choice of a $1,000 registration and reporting\nthreshold is also a far cry from the zero dollar threshold\ninvalidated in Canyon Ferry, 556 F.3d at 1033–34.

The $1,000 threshold appropriately reaches these\nmultipurpose organizations’ participation in the political\nprocess.\n\n    A-1’s political advocacy underscores this point. Although\nA-1’s political spending may be limited in proportion to its\noverall activities, the strength of Hawaii’s informational\ninterest does not fluctuate based on the diversity of the\nspeaker’s activities. Hawaii has an interest in ensuring the\npublic can follow the money in an election cycle, regardless\nof whether it comes from a single-issue, political advocacy\norganization or a for-profit corporation such as A-1. The\nCommission makes the reported information freely available\nin searchable databases on its website, which provides\nHawaiians with a vital window into the flow of campaign\ndollars.10 This prompt, electronic disclosure of contributions\nand expenditures “can provide . . . citizens with the\ninformation needed to hold corporations and elected officials\naccountable for their positions and supporters,” Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 370, and “given the Internet, disclosure\noffers much more robust protections against corruption,”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1460. Thus, the distinction\nbetween A-1, a for-profit electrical contractor, and a group\nlike Human Life of Washington, a “nonprofit, pro-life\nadvocacy corporation,” 624 F.3d at 994, is not\nconstitutionally significant here. A-1 may not make political\nadvocacy a priority, but it nonetheless has been a significant\nparticipant in Hawaii’s electoral process, justifying the state’s\nimposition of registration and reporting burdens.\n\n 10\n      See http://ags.hawaii.gov/campaign/nc/.\n\f38             A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n    Furthermore, Hawaii’s noncandidate committee\ndefinition, by extending beyond organizations making\npolitical advocacy a priority, avoids the circumvention of\nvalid campaign finance laws and disclosure requirements.\nSee Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1011–12. As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained:\n\n       [L]imiting disclosure requirements to groups\n       with the major purpose of influencing\n       elections would allow even those very groups\n       to circumvent the law with ease. Any\n       organization dedicated primarily to electing\n       candidates or promoting ballot measures\n       could easily dilute that major purpose by just\n       increasing its non-electioneering activities or\n       better yet by merging with a sympathetic\n       organization that engaged in activities\n       unrelated to campaigning.\n\nMadigan, 697 F.3d at 489. Hawaii’s definition addresses the\n“hard lesson of circumvention” in the campaign finance\narena, by including within its reach any entity that has\npolitical advocacy as one of its goals. McConnell, 540 U.S.\nat 165. As the district court explained:\n\n       [A-1] has purposely not created a separate\n       organizational structure for election-related\n       activity, choosing instead to register itself (A-\n       1 A-Lectrician, Inc.) as a noncandidate\n       committee. If it were allowed to avoid\n       registration merely because its political\n       activity is small proportionally to its overall\n       activities (as an electrical contractor and\n       perhaps as a pure issue advocacy\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                           39\n\n         organization), it would encourage any\n         affiliated noncandidate committee to avoid\n         disclosure requirements by merging its\n         activities into a larger affiliated organization.\n\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1052 (citation omitted).11\n\n    In sum, the noncandidate committee definition and\naccompanying reporting and disclosure requirements are\nsubstantially related to Hawaii’s important interests in\ninforming the electorate, preventing corruption or its\nappearance, and avoiding the circumvention of valid\ncampaign finance laws. Because the burden of complying\nwith this disclosure scheme is modest compared to the\nsignificance of the interests being served, we uphold Hawaii’s\nnoncandidate committee reporting and disclosure\nrequirements as applied to A-1.\n\n    In doing so on an as-applied basis, we have no occasion\nto consider whether Hawaii law would withstand exacting\nscrutiny as applied to another business or nonprofit group that\nseeks to engage in less substantial political advocacy than A-\n1.

A single contributor may\nprovide thousands of dollars to independent committees, and yet avoid\ndisclosing its identity if the committee makes all the expenditures itself.\nThe noncandidate committee definition acts to ensure that the\ncontributor’s identity will be disclosed to the voting public. Hawaii’s\nefforts to provide transparency would be incomplete if disclosure was not\nrequired in such circumstances.\n\f40                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\n‘imaginary’ cases.” Wash.

The\nburdens attending such a status are modest and substantially\nrelated to important government interests.\n\n B. The Disclaimer Requirement for Advertisements is\n         Constitutional Under Citizens United\n\n    A-1 contends that Hawaii’s requirement that political\nadvertising include a disclaimer as to the affiliation of the\nadvertiser with a candidate or candidate committee cannot\nsurvive exacting scrutiny. “Advertisements” for purposes of\nHawaii election law are print and broadcast communications\nthat (1) identify a candidate or ballot issue directly or by\nimplication and (2) “advocate[] or support[] the nomination,\nopposition, or election of the candidate, or advocate[] the\npassage or defeat of the issue or question on the ballot.” HRS\n§ 11-302. The challenged disclaimer rule provides that an\nadvertisement must include a “notice in a prominent location”\nthat “[t]he advertisement has the approval and authority of the\ncandidate” or “has not been approved by the candidate.”\nHRS § 11-391(a)(2).12, 13 The rule thus advises voters\nwhether an advertisement is coordinated with or independent\n\n\n  12\n     A-1 does not challenge the related requirement that all political\nadvertisements disclose the name and address of the person or entity\npaying for the ad. See HRS § 11-391(a)(1).\n 13\n    This provision was amended during the pendency of this appeal, but\nthe minor changes are immaterial. See 2014 Hawaii Laws Act 128 (H.B.\n452).\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   41\n\nfrom a candidate for elected office. The fine for violating this\nsection is $25 per advertisement, not to exceed $5,000 in the\naggregate. See HRS § 11-391(b).\n\n    A-1 seeks to place advertisements that (1) mention a\ncandidate by name; (2) run in close proximity to an election;\nand (3) include language stating that particular candidates\n“are representatives who do not listen to the people,” “do not\nunderstand the importance of the values that made our nation\ngreat” or “do not show the aloha spirit.” It argues the\ndisclaimer requirement is unconstitutional because it\nregulates the content of speech itself and is therefore an even\ngreater incursion on its First Amendment rights than\nreporting requirements. A-1 further contends a disclaimer\ncan be mandated only for speech that is a federal\nelectioneering communication, as defined by federal law, or\nthat is express advocacy, not including its functional\nequivalent.\n\n    We agree with the district court that the disclaimer\nrequirement survives exacting scrutiny as applied to A-1’s\nnewspaper advertisements. Like the noncandidate committee\nrequirements, the disclaimer serves an important\ngovernmental interest by informing the public about who is\nspeaking in favor or against a candidate before the election\nand imposes only a modest burden on First Amendment\nrights. A-1’s arguments to the contrary are all but foreclosed\nby Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–69.\n\n    First, the disclaimer requirement imposes only a modest\nburden on A-1’s First Amendment rights. Like disclosure\nrequirements, “[d]isclaimer . . . requirements may burden the\nability to speak, but they impose no ceiling on campaign-\nrelated activities and do not prevent anyone from speaking.”\n\f42              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nId. at 366 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nHawaii’s disclaimer requirement is no more burdensome than\nthe one for televised electioneering communications upheld\nin Citizens United. See id. at 366–69. That rule required a\nstatement as to who was responsible for the content of the\nadvertisement “be made in a ‘clearly spoken manner,’ and\ndisplayed on the screen in a ‘clearly readable manner’ for at\nleast four seconds,” along with a further statement that “the\ncommunication ‘is not authorized by any candidate or\ncandidate’s committee.’” Id. at 366 (quoting 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441d(d)(2), (a)(3)). Similarly, all that is required here is a\nshort statement stating that the advertisement is published,\nbroadcast, televised, or circulated with or without the\napproval and authority of the candidate. See HRS § 11-\n391(a).\n\n    Second, requiring a disclaimer is closely related to\nHawaii’s important governmental interest in “dissemination\nof information regarding the financing of political messages.”\nMcKee, 649 F.3d at 61. A-1’s past advertisements ran shortly\nbefore an election and criticized candidates by name as\npersons who did not, for example, “listen to the people.” As\nthe district court found, these advertisements – published on\nor shortly before election day – are not susceptible to any\nreasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote\nagainst a candidate. Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1055.\nSuch ads are the very kind for which “the public has an\ninterest in knowing who is speaking,” Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 369, and where disclaimers can “avoid confusion\nby making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or\npolitical party,” id. at 368. See also Worley, 717 F.3d at\n1253–55 (rejecting a challenge to an analogous disclaimer\nrequirement); McKee, 649 F.3d at 61 (same); Alaska Right to\nLife, 441 F.3d at 792–93 (same). And contrary to A-1’s\n\f                   A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                            43\n\nargument, nothing in Citizens United suggests that a state\nmay not require disclaimers for political advertising that is\nnot the functional equivalent of a federal electioneering\ncommunication.       In applying the federal disclaimer\nrequirement to an advertisement urging voters to see a short\nfilm about a presidential candidate, Citizens United explained\nthat “[e]ven if the ads only pertain to a commercial\ntransaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.”\n558 U.S. at 369.14\n\n   Accordingly, the disclaimer requirement does not violate\nthe First Amendment as applied to A-1’s political\nadvertisements.\n\n\n\n\n   14\n      We reject A-1’s comparison to the disclaimer invalidated by the\nSupreme Court in McIntyre v.

There, the Supreme Court considered the\nconstitutionality of “aggregate limits” under federal law, which\n“restrict[ed] how much money a donor [could] contribute in total to all\ncandidates or committees” in a given election period. See 134 S. Ct. at\n1442 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3)).

It is closely drawn because it targets direct\ncontributions from contractors to officeholders and\ncandidates, the contributions most closely linked to actual and\nperceived quid pro quo corruption. See Green Party,\n616 F.3d at 202; see also McCutcheon, 134 S.

See Yamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at\n1058–59 nn. 26–27 (summarizing the evidence of past\nscandals and the perception of corruption). Thus, as a general\nmatter, Hawaii’s ban on contributions by government\ncontractors satisfies closely drawn scrutiny.\n\n    A-1’s narrower argument that the contractor contribution\nban is unconstitutional as applied to its contributions to\nlawmakers and candidates who neither award nor oversee its\ncontracts is also without merit. Hawaii’s interest in\npreventing actual or the appearance of quid pro quo\ncorruption is no less potent as applied to A-1’s proposed\ncontributions because the Hawaii legislature as a whole\nconsiders all bills concerning procurement. Thus, although\nan individual legislator may not be closely involved in\nawarding or overseeing a particular contract, state money can\n\n  18\n    Hawaii’s contractor contribution ban is narrower than many others.\nThe ban upheld in Green Party, for example, applied not only to\ncontractors but also to principals of that contractor and to family members\nof a contractor or of a principal of a contractor. See Green Party,\n616 F.3d at 202–03. The federal ban is also broader than the Hawaii ban;\nit applies not only to existing contractors but also to prospective\ncontractors. See 2 U.S.C. § 441c. Hawaii’s law does not prohibit A-1\nfrom making contributions as a prospective contractor, A-1’s principals\n(such as plaintiff Yamada) from making contributions or A-1 from making\nindependent expenditures on behalf of the candidates it seeks to support.\nCf. Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 161 n.8 (“A ban on direct corporate\ncontributions leaves individual members of corporations free to make their\nown contributions, and deprives the public of little or no material\ninformation.”).\n\f50              A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES\n\nbe spent only with an appropriation by the entire legislature.\nSee Haw. Const. art. VII, §§ 5, 9. Hawaii reasonably\nconcluded that contributions to any legislator could give rise\nto the appearance of corruption.\n\n    In essence, A-1 contends that Hawaii’s contractor ban\nshould be tailored more narrowly, but narrower tailoring is\nnot required here. There is no question the ban is closely\ndrawn to the state’s anticorruption interest as a general\nmatter, and we decline to revisit the legislature’s judgment\nnot to craft a still narrower provision. Closely drawn scrutiny\nrequires “a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable,”\nand Hawaii’s contractor contribution ban is a reasonable\nresponse to the strong appearance of corruption that existed\nat the time of the legislature’s actions. McCutcheon, 134 S.\nCt. at 1456 (quoting Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y.\nv. Fox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112329\"><a href=\"/opinion/112329/board-of-trustees-of-state-univ-of-ny-v-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (1989)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We need not “determine with any degree of\nexactitude the precise restriction necessary to carry out the\nstatute’s legitimate objectives” to uphold the contribution\nban. Randall, 548 U.S. at 248.\n\n     Even if narrower tailoring were required, A-1’s proposal\nfor a narrower ban is unworkable. A-1 does not explain how\nit would determine, before the election, which candidates\nwould neither award nor oversee any of its contracts. The\nmembership of the various legislative committees can change\nwith each election, and a different committee – whether the\nEducation Committee or Public Safety, Government\nOperations, and Military Affairs Committee – may serve a\ngreater or lesser oversight role on a particular project. There\nis, therefore, a “clear fallacy” in A-1’s logic:\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   51\n\n       [During the 2011 Legislative Session], A-1\n       testified . . . in favor of a construction and\n       procurement-related bill regarding the\n       University of Hawaii.          At least three\n       Legislators that served on committees that\n       considered the bill (and voted in favor of it)\n       also received campaign contributions from A-\n       1 in the 2010 elections. And A-1 made\n       contributions to opponents of fifteen other\n       Legislators who considered the bill.\n\nYamada III, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 1061 n.30 (citation omitted).\nSimply put, A-1 cannot predict with certainty which\ncandidates will not become involved in the contract award or\noversight process when it makes its contributions. Moreover,\nA-1’s contributions to candidates who do not become directly\ninvolved in contract award and oversight could still create the\nappearance of “the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political\nfavors.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359 (quoting Fed.\nElection Comm’n v.

Under\n41 U.S.C. § 1988(b), the district court had discretion to award\n“the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee.” We\nreview the award for an abuse of discretion, but any element\nof legal analysis that figures into the district court’s decision\nis reviewed de novo. See Watson v. Cnty. of Riverside,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778828\"><a href=\"/opinion/778828/tracy-l-watson-v-county-of-riverside-and-larry-d-smith-rick-sayer/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095 (9th Cir. 2002). The plaintiffs’ primary\ncontention, with which we agree, is that the district court\nerred by refusing to award the fees they incurred in\nsuccessfully defending against the defendants’ interlocutory\nappeal. We address the plaintiffs’ other contentions in a\nconcurrently filed memorandum disposition.\n\n    In October 2010, the district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction in favor of the plaintiffs on their claim that HRS\n§ 11-358, limiting to $1,000 contributions to noncandidate\ncommittees, violates the First Amendment. The defendants\nthen filed an interlocutory appeal. After the parties finished\nbriefing in this court, however, the defendants dismissed the\nappeal, presumably in light of an intervening decision\nupholding a preliminary injunction of a similar contribution\nlimit. See Thalheimer, 645 F.3d at 1117–21. In subsequent\ndistrict court proceedings, the defendants offered to stipulate\nto a permanent injunction against § 11-358. The parties,\nhowever, were unable to reach agreement on the form of an\ninjunction, and on the parties’ subsequent cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, the district court permanently enjoined\n§ 11-358 as applied to the plaintiffs’ proposed contributions.\n\n    Based on their successful constitutional challenge to § 11-\n358, Yamada and Stewart sought attorney’s fees and costs,\nincluding those fees incurred in defending against the\ndefendants’ interlocutory appeal, under § 1988. The district\ncourt granted in part and denied in part their fee request. As\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                   53\n\nrelevant here, it concluded it had “no authority” to award fees\npertaining to the interlocutory appeal because (1) the\nplaintiffs became prevailing parties when the defendants\nabandoned their appeal of the preliminary injunction, see\nWatson, 300 F.3d at 1095 (stating that, under certain\ncircumstances, “a plaintiff who obtains a preliminary\ninjunction is a prevailing party for purposes of § 1988”), and\n(2) under Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6 and Cummings v.\nConnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789738\"><a href=\"/opinion/789738/christine-a-cummings-janet-taylor-darvas-richard-k-dehart-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940 (9th Cir. 2005) (Cummings II),\n“[a] district court is not authorized to award attorney’s fees\nfor an appeal unless we transfer the fee request to the district\ncourt for consideration.” Because it assumed the plaintiffs\ncould have requested fees from the Ninth Circuit as\nprevailing parties when the defendants dismissed their appeal,\nthe court concluded it had no authority to award fees for the\nappeal.\n\n    The plaintiffs contend, and we agree, that the district\ncourt’s analysis was flawed for two reasons. First, contrary\nto the district court’s analysis, Yamada and Stewart were not\nyet prevailing parties when the defendants dismissed their\ninterlocutory appeal and could not have requested fees at that\ntime. A court may award attorney’s fees under § 1988 only\nto a “prevailing party,” and a plaintiff prevails for purposes\nof § 1988 only “when actual relief on the merits of his claim\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\nmodifying the defendant’s behavior in a way that directly\nbenefits the plaintiff.” Higher Taste, Inc. v.

As explained in Higher Taste, Watson stands\nfor the proposition that, “when a plaintiff wins a preliminary\ninjunction and the case is rendered moot before final\njudgment, either by the passage of time or other\ncircumstances beyond the parties’ control, the plaintiff is a\nprevailing party eligible for a fee award.” Higher Taste,\n717 F.3d at 717 (emphasis added). Here, the plaintiffs’\nchallenge to HRS § 11-358 was not “rendered moot” until the\ndistrict court entered final judgment against the Commission\non that claim. A plaintiff does not become a prevailing party\nuntil it obtains relief that is “no longer subject to being\n‘reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final\ndecision in the same case.’” Id. (quoting Sole, 551 U.S. at\n83). Here, that occurred when the district court entered a\nfinal judgment on the plaintiffs’ § 11-358 claim, not when the\nCommission abandoned its appeal of the adverse preliminary\ninjunction ruling.19\n\n   The defendants argue Yamada and Stewart were\nnonetheless prevailing parties at the time the defendants\ndismissed their interlocutory appeal because the preliminary\n\n     19\n       Higher Taste extended Watson’s prevailing party analysis to\ncircumstances in which a plaintiff obtains a preliminary injunction and\nthen the case is dismissed upon the parties’ stipulation following\nsettlement, when the settlement agreement provides the plaintiff with\n“what it had hoped to obtain through a permanent injunction.” 717 F.3d\nat 717–18. Here, however, the parties did not reach a settlement\nagreement at the time of the preliminary injunction appeal or any time\nthereafter.\n\f                A-1 A-LECTRICIAN V. SNIPES                  55\n\ninjunction issued by the district court was not an “ephemeral”\nvictory at all, but “a published opinion, resolving a\nconstitutional question, enjoining a campaign finance law\nweeks before an election.” That the preliminary injunction\nwould be converted into a permanent one appeared to be a\n“foregone conclusion” to the parties and the district court,\nparticularly once we issued our decision in Thalheimer.\n\n    We disagree. Because the preliminary injunction order\ncould be negated by a final decision on the merits, it was an\ninterlocutory order that did not confer prevailing party status\non the plaintiffs when the defendants dismissed their appeal.\n\n    Furthermore, because the plaintiffs were not yet\nprevailing parties when the defendants dismissed the\ninterlocutory appeal, the district court erred by relying on\nCummings II to deny them attorney’s fees for the appeal.\nCummings II was the second appeal before this court in a case\nproceeding under § 1983. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the plaintiffs in the underlying case, and the\ndefendant appealed that final order. In Cummings v. Connell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780560\"><a href=\"/opinion/780560/christine-a-cummings-janet-taylor-darvas-richard-k-dehart-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898–99 (9th Cir. 2003) (Cummings I), we\nupheld the grant of summary judgment as to the defendant’s\nliability, thus preserving the plaintiffs’ status as prevailing\nparties on the merits, but remanded for reconsideration of\ndamages. On remand, the district court awarded an additional\n$30,000 in attorney’s fees the plaintiffs had incurred\ndefending against the defendant’s prior appeal in Cummings\nI. Cummings II, 402 F.3d at 942, 947. The parties cross-\nappealed again. We held that the fees related to the first\nappeal were improperly awarded “because plaintiffs failed to\nfile their request with the court of appeals as required by\nNinth Circuit Rule 39-1.6.” Id. at 947.
