Code, § 810 et\nseq.), before commencing an action against a public entity, a\nplaintiff must present the claim to the entity within six\nmonths of “the date upon which the cause of action would be\ndeemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of\nlimitations which would be applicable thereto.” (Gov. Code,\n§ 901.) In the underlying action, real parties in interest\nSandra Reyes Jauregui and Mario Reyes Jauregui (the\nJaureguis) filed a first amended complaint (FAC), alleging a\ncause of action against petitioner City of Pasadena (the City)\narising from Sandra Jauregui’s mesothelioma. The City\ndemurred to the Jaureguis’ complaint, arguing that they had\nfailed to comply with the claim presentation requirement of\nthe Government Claims Act by not presenting their claim to\nthe City within six months of the date of Sandra’s\nmesothelioma diagnosis. The Jaureguis opposed the\ndemurrer, arguing that their claim presentation was timely\nbecause under the applicable statute of limitations -- Code of\n\n\n\n                              2\n\fCivil Procedure section 340.2 -- their cause of action never\naccrued.1 Thus, they asserted, the six-month claim\npresentation period never began to run. The trial court\noverruled the demurrer, and the City now seeks a writ\ndirecting the trial court to sustain the demurrer.\n      For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that “the\ndate upon which the cause of action would be deemed to\nhave accrued within the meaning of the [applicable] statute\nof limitations” is the date on which a plaintiff discovers or\nshould reasonably have discovered that she had suffered a\ncompensable injury. In this case, that date was no later\nthan the date Sandra was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\nBecause the Jaureguis presented their claim to the City\nmore than 10 months after that date, they failed to comply\nwith the claim presentation requirement. Accordingly, we\ngrant the petition for writ of mandate.\n\n      FACTUAL BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL\n                          HISTORY\n      On October 5, 2015, the Jaureguis filed a complaint for\npersonal injuries and loss of consortium against numerous\ndefendants, but not the City. The complaint alleged that\nSandra was diagnosed with mesothelioma on or about\nSeptember 25, 2015. She allegedly developed the disease as\na result of exposure to airborne asbestos that her father “was\n\n\n     All further statutory citations are to the Code of Civil\n1\n\n\nProcedure, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fexposed to and thereafter tracked into the family’s home and\nvehicles on his clothing, shoes, person, and personal effects.”\nThe complaint also alleged that Sandra’s father was a\nmechanic who worked with asbestos-containing products at\nvarious sites, including at “The City of Pasadena from about\n1980 to 1987.”\n       A year later, on October 14, 2016, the Jaureguis filed\ntheir FAC, adding the City as a defendant. The FAC alleged\na single cause of action against the City for dangerous\nconditions of public property. According to the FAC,\nSandra’s father worked for the City as a vehicle mechanic\nand was exposed to asbestos at various vehicle repair\nfacilities owned, controlled or managed by the City. The\nFAC further alleged that on August 22, 2016, the Jaureguis\npresented their claim to the City in compliance with the\nGovernment Claims Act.2\n       On November 17, 2016, the City demurred to the FAC.\nIt argued that the Jaureguis had failed to allege facts\ndemonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim\npresentation requirement set forth in Government Code\nsection 911.2, which requires that a claim be presented\nwithin six months of the accrual of the cause of action. The\nCity asserted that the Jaureguis’ causes of action accrued on\n\n      Although the FAC initially asserted Mario’s loss-of-\n2\n\n\nconsortium claim against the City, the Jaureguis agreed to\ndismiss that claim. Thus, the only claim against the City at\nissue is the cause of action based on allegedly dangerous\nconditions.\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fSeptember 25, 2015, the date when Sandra was diagnosed\nwith mesothelioma. However, the Jaureguis did not present\na claim to the City until August 22, 2016, nearly 11 months\nlater. Nor did they file a late-claim application.\nAccordingly, the City asserted, the Jaureguis failed to\ncomply with the claim presentation requirement and thus,\nthe demurrer should have been sustained without leave to\namend.\n       The City further argued that section 340.2, the\napplicable statute of limitations for the Jaureguis’ cause of\naction, did not render their claim presentation timely.\nAlthough the limitations period did not run because Sandra\nwas never disabled within the meaning of section 340.2, that\nsection “says nothing about the accrual of the cause of\naction.” Accordingly, the City asserted, section 340.2 did not\nprovide an accrual date other than the date of diagnosis.\n       The Jaureguis opposed the City’s demurrer, contending\nthere was no time limit on their claim presentation. They\nargued: “Sandra’s government claim had to be filed within\nsix months of the ‘accrual’ of her underlying tort causes of\naction -- a date statutorily defined for this purpose as the\ntrigger date for the underlying limitations period.” Because\nthat date was never triggered, “Sandra’s claims never\n‘accrued’ for purposes of filing a government claim.” They\nfurther argued that “accrual” has two different meanings --\n(1) “‘ripeness’” and (2) “‘beginning of the limitations period’” -\n- and “accrual” as used in Government Code section 901\nmeant the latter.\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      In reply, the City argued that section 340.2 did not\nequate “accrual” with the commencement of the limitations\nperiod. Although section 340.2 altered the limitations period\n-- the time during which a plaintiff may file a complaint -- it\nhad no impact on when a cause of action accrued. The City\nalso argued that nothing in section 340.2 reflects an intent\non the part of the Legislature to modify the claim\npresentation deadline in the Government Claims Act.\n      On December 15, 2016, the trial court overruled the\ndemurrer without explanation. However, at the hearing on\nthe demurrer, the court stated its belief that the term\n“accrual” as used in Government Code section 901 is “not\nused in the sense of a case being ripe so that somebody can\nsue.” Rather, it is used to mean “when a person must sue or\nlose their right,” i.e., when the limitations period\ncommences.\n      The City filed its petition on February 21, 2017,\nseeking an immediate stay of all proceedings and a\nperemptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to set\naside and vacate its order overruling the demurrer and to\nenter a new order sustaining the demurrer.3 In response to\n\n\n      Writ review is proper because a “significant legal issue\n3\n\n\nis presented, and the benefits of the claims act defense would\nbe effectively lost if defendant[] [was] forced to go to trial.”\n(City of Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730,\n747, fn. 4; see also State of California v. Superior Court\n(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1245 [“failure to allege compliance or\ncircumstances excusing compliance with the claim\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fthe petition, on March 16, 2017, we issued an order to show\ncause why the demurrer should not be sustained and an\norder for a temporary stay entered. The Juareguis filed\ntheir return to the petition on April 14, 2017, and the City\nfiled its reply May 5, 2017.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n       “Government Code section 905 requires that ‘all claims\nfor money or damages against local public entities’ be\npresented to the responsible public entity before a lawsuit is\nfiled.” (City of Stockton v. Superior Court, supra, 42 Cal.4th\nat p. 734.) “Claims for personal injury and property damage\nmust be presented within six months after accrual; all other\nclaims must be presented within a year. ([Gov. Code,] §\n911.2.) ‘[N]o suit for money or damages may be brought\nagainst a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim\nis required to be presented . . . until a written claim therefor\n\npresentation requirement subjects a complaint to a general\ndemurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a\ncause of action”].) We apply the same standard of demurrer\nreview, that is, we review demurrer rulings de novo. (City of\nStockton v. Superior Court, at p. 747; accord, K.J. v. Arcadia\nUnified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1237\n[“Our review is de novo.”].)\n      The City also sought a stay of the trial, which had been\nscheduled for June 12, 2017. Subsequently, the City filed a\nletter brief informing this court that the trial court had\ngranted its ex parte application to continue the trial to\nOctober 30, 2017.\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fhas been presented to the public entity and has been acted\nupon . . . or has been deemed to have been rejected . . . .’\n([Gov. Code,] § 945.4.) ‘Thus, under these statutes, failure to\ntimely present a claim for money or damages to a public\nentity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that\nentity.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 738.)\n      “The purpose of the claims statutes is not to prevent\nsurprise, but ‘to provide the public entity sufficient\ninformation to enable it to adequately investigate claims and\nto settle them, if appropriate, without the expense of\nlitigation. [Citations.] It is well-settled that claims statutes\nmust be satisfied even in face of the public entity’s actual\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim.’\n[Citation.] The claims statutes also ‘enable the public entity\nto engage in fiscal planning for potential liabilities and to\navoid similar liabilities in the future.’ [Citations.]” (City of\nStockton v. Superior Court, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 738.)\n      Here, the Jaureguis were obligated to present their\nclaims against petitioner “not later than six months after the\naccrual of the cause of action.” (Gov. Code, § 911.2.)4 “For\nthe purpose of computing the time limits prescribed by\n[Government Code section] 911.2 . . . , the date of the accrual\nof a cause of action to which a claim relates is the date upon\nwhich the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued\n\n      For purposes of the Government Claims Act, six\n4\n\n\nmonths means “six calendar months or 182 days, whichever\nis longer.” (Gonzales v. County of Los Angeles (1988) 199\nCal.App.3d 601, 604.)\n\n\n\n                               8\n\fwithin the meaning of the statute of limitations which would\nbe applicable thereto if there were no requirement that a\nclaim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity\nbefore an action could be commenced thereon. . . .” (Gov.\nCode, § 901.) Thus, to calculate the claim presentation\ndeadline, we must determine the date the cause of action\naccrued under the applicable statute of limitations. (Ovando\nv. County of Los Angeles (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 42, 63 [“The\ndate of accrual for purposes of the claim presentation\nrequirement is the same date on which the cause of action\nwould accrue for purposes of the statute of limitations in an\naction against a private party.”].)\n      Here, the statute of limitations applicable to the\nJuareguis’ claim is found in section 340.2. That section\nprovides in relevant part:\n      “(a) In any civil action for injury or illness based upon\n      exposure to asbestos, the time for the commencement\n      of the action shall be the later of the following:\n      “(1) Within one year after the date the plaintiff first\n      suffered disability.\n      “(2) Within one year after the date the plaintiff either\n      knew, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence\n      should have known, that such disability was caused or\n      contributed to by such exposure.\n      “(b) ‘Disability’ as used in subdivision (a) means the\n      loss of time from work as a result of such exposure\n      which precludes the performance of the employee’s\n      regular occupation.” (§ 340.2, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n                               9\n\f      Under section 340.2, “the limitations period does not\nbegin until the asbestos-related injuries cause a permanent\ntermination of the plaintiff’s ability to perform his or her job,\nwhich actually forces the plaintiff off the job.” (Duty v. Abex\nCorp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 742, 750.) For retirees and the\nunemployed, the limitations period never commences. (Ibid.)\nIn the instant matter, the parties agree that Sandra was\nnever disabled within the meaning of section 340.2 and thus,\nthe limitations period on the Juareguis’ claim has never\nbegun to run.\n      Section 340.2 does not use the term “accrued.” That\nterm is used in section 312, which is found in the same title\nof the Code of Civil Procedure as section 340.2. Section 312\nprovides: “Civil actions, without exception, can only be\ncommenced within the periods prescribed in this title, after\nthe cause of action shall have accrued . . . .” Thus, accrual is\na prerequisite to the running of the limitation period. (Barr\nv. Acands, Inc. (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1049, overruled\nin part on other grounds by Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp.\n(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147 (Hamilton).)\n      Under section 312, a cause of action accrues when “the\nparty owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action\nthereon.” (United States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Haidinger-Hayes,\nInc. (1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 596; see also Collins v. County of\nLos Angeles (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 451, 454 (Collins) [“A\ncause of action accrues at the moment the party who owns it\nis entitled to bring and prosecute an action thereon.”].)\n“Generally, the right to bring and prosecute an action arises\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fimmediately upon the commission of the wrong\nclaimed . . . .” (Ibid.) Stated differently, a “cause of action\naccrues ‘when [it] is complete with all of its elements’ —\nthose elements being wrongdoing, harm, and causation.”\n(Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 788, 797\n(Pooshs).)\n      An exception to the general rule regarding the initial\naccrual of a claim is the discovery rule. (Aryeh v. Canon\nBusiness Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1192\n(Aryeh).) Under the discovery rule, the accrual of a cause of\naction is delayed until “the plaintiff ‘discovers, or has reason\nto discover, the cause of action.’ [Citation.]” (Pooshs, supra,\n51 Cal.4th at p. 797; see also Seelenfreund v. Terminix of\nNorthern Cal., Inc. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 133, 136 [“In some\nsituations, . . . a cause of action does not accrue until the\naggrieved party discovers, or should discover, the existence\nof the cause of action.”].)5\n      Courts have applied a similar analysis when\naddressing statutes of limitations applicable to latent\ndiseases such as mesothelioma. In Buttram v. Owens-\n\n\n      Other doctrines that alter the general accrual rule\n5\n\n\ninclude: (1) the continuous violation doctrine which treats a\nseries of wrongs or injuries as a single cause of action that\naccrues upon commission or sufferance of the last of them;\nand (2) the theory of continuous accrual, which segregates a\nseries of wrongs or injuries into separate causes of action,\neach accruing on a separate date. (Aryeh, supra, 55 Cal.4th\nat p. 1192.)\n\n\n\n                              11\n\fCorning Fiberglas Corp. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 520 (Buttram),\nour Supreme Court noted that “as a general proposition it is\nsettled that a plaintiff’s cause of action accrues for purposes\nof the statute of limitations upon the occurrence of the last\nelement essential to the cause of action; that is when the\nplaintiff is first entitled to sue.” (Id. at p. 531, fn. 4, citing §\n312.) However, the discovery rule applies to delay the\naccrual of a cause of action for an asbestos-related disease.\nThus, the court observed, “for statute of limitations\npurposes, it is well settled that a cause of action for a latent\ninjury does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers or\nreasonably should have discovered that he has suffered a\ncompensable injury.” (Id. at p. 530, citing Velasquez v.\nFibreboard Paper Products Corp. (1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 881,\n887-888.) In Hamilton, the court reaffirmed Buttram,\nstating: “[A] cause of action for a latent injury or disease\ngenerally accrues, in the sense that it is ripe for suit, when\nthe plaintiff discovers or should reasonably have discovered\nhe has suffered a compensable injury.” (Hamilton, supra, 22\nCal.4th at p. 1144.)\n      As the foregoing demonstrates, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations, “accrual” of an action is used in the\nsense of ripeness. This is also the ordinary and common\nunderstanding of the term “accrue.” In Webster’s Seventh\nNew Collegiate Dictionary (1969) page 6, the first definition\nof “accrue” is “to come into existence as a legally enforceable\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fclaim.”6 Likewise, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “accrue” as\n“To come into existence as an enforceable claim or right; to\narise <the plaintiff's cause of action for silicosis did not\naccrue until the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the\ndisease>.” (Black’s Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014).)7\n      In sum, we conclude that as used in Government Code\nsection 901, “the date upon which the cause of action would\nbe deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute\nof limitations which would be applicable” is the date on\nwhich the cause of action became actionable. In the instant\nmatter, the Jaureguis’ cause of action against the City\naccrued when Sandra discovered or reasonably should have\ndiscovered that she had suffered a compensable injury. That\ndate was no later than the date she was diagnosed with\nmesothelioma, September 25, 2015. However, the Jaureguis\ndid not present their claim to the City until August 22, 2016,\nmore than 10 months after Sandra was diagnosed. Thus,\nthey failed to comply with the six-month claim presentation\ndeadline set forth in Government Code section 911.2.\n\n\n      The other definitions are: “to come by way of increase\n6\n\n\nor addition” and “to be periodically accumulated whether as\nan increase or a decrease.” (Webster’s 7th New Collegiate\nDict., supra, at p. 6.)\n\n     Black’s Law Dictionary has only one other definition of\n7\n\n\n“accrue”: “To accumulate periodically; to increase over a\nperiod of time <the savings-account interest accrues\nmonthly>.”\n\n\n\n                              13\n\fAccordingly, their action against the City is barred, and the\nCity’s demurrer should have been sustained.\n      The Juareguis argue that under Government Code\nsection 901, “accrue” does not mean ripeness. Rather, they\ncontend, it means “commencement of the limitations period.”\nThey note that in Nelson v. Flintkote Co. (1985) 172\nCal.App.3d 727, the appellate court characterized section\n340.2 as a “delayed accrual rule.” (Nelson v. Flintkote Co., at\np. 735.) We acknowledge that many courts have used\n“accrue” or “accrual” when referring to the commencement of\nthe running of the statute of limitations. A likely reason for\nthe conflation of the two concepts is that in the vast majority\nof cases, the date an action accrues is also the date the\nstatute of limitations begins to run. Our Supreme Court has\nrecognized, however, that “the accrual of a cause of action” is\ndistinct from “the beginning of the limitations period.”\n(Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.) Thus, in Hamilton,\nthe court observed that it would be a “mistake[]” to “equate[]\nthe accrual of a cause of action for asbestos-related injury\nwith the beginning of the limitations period prescribed by\nsection 340.2.” (Ibid.) The court explained: “Before the\nenactment of section 340.2, [the] accrual date was also the\ndate of the beginning of the limitations period in cases in\nwhich the latent injury or disease arose from exposure to\nasbestos. [Citation.] But section 340.2 changed that rule,\ndeclaring a separate and distinct date for the beginning of\nthe limitations period in asbestos cases, i.e., the date of\ndisability as specially defined in the statute.” (Id. at pp.\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f1144-1145, italics omitted.) Notably, the Hamilton court\nnever used the term “accrual” when referring to the\nbeginning of the limitations period. In short, “[a]lthough\ncommentators have referred to [section 340.2] as providing\nfor a ‘postponed accrual’ date [citation], it is more accurately\ndescribed as a statute of repose -- a time in the future after\nwhich a claimant may not file suit because the claim\nbecomes stale.” (Barr v. Acands, Inc., supra, 57 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1049.)\n       The Jaureguis’ argument that “accrue” means only\n“commencement of the limitations period” would lead to the\nanomalous result that they could not bring the instant\naction. As noted, under section 340.2, the limitations period\nbegins to run on the date of “disability.” Because Sandra\nnever suffered a “disability,” the limitations period has never\nbegun to run, and under the Jaureguis’ interpretation their\ncause of action has not -- and never will -- accrue. However,\nunder section 312, “without exception,” an action may not be\nfiled until the underlying claim “shall have accrued.” Thus,\nthe Jaureguis could never bring a suit for an asbestos-\nrelated injury or illness. Like other courts, we reject such an\ninterpretation. (See Barr v. Acands, Inc., supra, 57\nCal.App.4th at p. 1049 [“If a claim for personal injuries\nallegedly resulting from asbestos exposure could not accrue\nuntil disability occurred, it would lead to the anomalous\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\fresult that plaintiffs who did not suffer disability as defined\nby the statute would be forever barred from filing suit.”].)8\n      The Jaureguis further argue that interpreting\n“accrued” to mean when a cause of action is ripe would\nrewrite Government Code section 901 to excise any reference\nto statutes of limitations. We disagree. In the context of\nstatutes of limitations, accrual refers to the settled common\nlaw accrual rules, including the discovery rule delaying\naccrual of a cause of action. (See Aryeh, supra, 55 Cal.4th at\np. 1193 [where statute of limitations uses term “accrued” but\nprovides no definition, we may assume “the Legislature\nintended the well-settled body of law that has built up\naround accrual, including the traditional last element rule\nand its equitable exceptions, to apply fully here”].) In\nButtram, the court noted that it was “well settled” that “for\nstatute of limitations purposes,” a cause of action for a latent\ninjury, such as asbestos-related mesothelioma, does not\naccrue “until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should\nhave discovered that [she] has suffered a compensable\ninjury.” (Buttram, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 530; accord,\nHamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.) Thus, construing\n“accrual” in Government Code section 901 as our Supreme\n\n     We note that the Legislature has not acted on Justice\n8\n\n\nBrown’s suggestion to revisit and revise the “cumbersome\nand confusing” language of section 340.2, which has created\nseveral “anomalous,” “bizarre” and likely unintended results.\n(See Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1152 (conc. opn. of\nBrown, J.).)\n\n\n\n                               16\n\fCourt has done “for statute of limitations purposes” is\nconsistent with the statutory language.\n       Finally, the Jaureguis contend that the intent and\npurpose of section 340.2 -- “to provide a unique and forgiving\nlimitations period to those suffering from an asbestos-related\nillness” -- warrants interpreting Government Code section\n901 to permit them to present an asbestos-related claim\nagainst the City at any time prior to filing their action\nagainst the City. However, the intent and purpose\nanimating section 340.2 must be balanced against the intent\nand purposes animating the Government Claims Act. As\nnoted, the purposes of the Government Claims Act are (1) to\nprovide the public entity with sufficient information to\nenable it to adequately investigate and settle claims, and (2)\nto enable the entity to account for potential liabilities and to\navoid similar liabilities in the future. (City of Stockton v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 738.) “Moreover, the\nintent of the Government Claims Act is ‘not to expand the\nrights of plaintiffs against government entities. Rather, the\nintent of the act is to confine potential governmental liability\nto rigidly delineated circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (DiCampli-\nMintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012) 55 Cal.4th 983, 991.)\nAn unlimited claim presentation period expanding the rights\nof plaintiffs against government entities would frustrate the\nintent and purposes of the Government Claims Act. It could\nhamper a public entity from taking immediate remedial\naction -- such as using asbestos-free products -- and impede\nits fiscal planning. (See Johnson v. San Diego Unified\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fSchool Dist. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 692, 696-697 [“‘claims\nstatute provides an opportunity to the public entity to\nquickly rectify a dangerous condition and . . . to take the\npotential claim into account in its fiscal planning’”].)\n      Moreover, the Juareguis have pointed to nothing in the\nlanguage or legislative history of section 340.2 to suggest\nthat the Legislature intended, sub silencio, to amend the six-\nmonth claim presentation deadline in the Government\nClaims Act. On this point, we find the 2002 amendment to\nsection 340.1 instructive. In 2002, the Legislature amended\nsection 340.1 by adding, inter alia, subdivision (c) which\nprovides that any claims for damages arising from childhood\nsex abuse that would otherwise be barred solely because the\napplicable statute of limitations has or had expired “is\nrevived, and, in that case, a cause of action may be\ncommenced within one year of January 1, 2003.” (§ 340.1,\nsubd. (c).) Subsequently, our Supreme Court was asked to\ndetermine whether a plaintiff who failed to present a timely\nclaim to a public entity could thereafter bring a claim for\nchildhood sex abuse against the entity under the amended\nsection 340.1. The court concluded the answer was “no.”\n(Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201,\n205 (Shirk), superseded by statute as stated in A.M. v.\nVentura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252.)\nThe court observed that section 340.1, subdivision (c) revived\nonly claims barred solely because of the applicable statute of\nlimitations. However, “the government claim presentation\ndeadline is not a statute of limitations.” Thus, section 340.1\n\n\n\n                              18\n\fdid not revive those claims barred by failure to comply with\nthe claim presentation requirement. (Shirk, supra, at p.\n213.)\n      Moreover, as the appellate court in S.M. v. Los Angeles\nUnified School Dist. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 712 (S.M.)\nobserved, although section 340.1 extended “the time during\nwhich a victim of childhood sexual abuse may sue, . . . it [did]\nnot alter the cause of action’s accrual date, which is when\nthe molestation occurred subject to any applicable delayed\ndiscovery. [Citation.] It is the date of accrual that triggers\nthe government tort claim filing requirement, a predicate\nnot addressed by section 340.1.” (Id. at p. 721.)\n      Following Shirk, the Legislature enacted Government\nCode section 905, subdivision (m), adding childhood sex\nabuse claims “arising out of conduct occurring on or after\nJanuary 1, 2009” to those claims exempted from the\ngovernment claim presentation requirement. (See Gov.\nCode, § 905 [listing exempted claims].) Notably, the\nLegislature did not overrule Shirk’s holding for childhood\nabuse claims arising from conduct occurring prior to 2009.\n(See S.M., supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 721, fn. 6.) Nor did\nthe Legislature address the date of accrual for such claims.\n      Here, in enacting section 340.2, the Legislature\nextended the limitations period for asbestos-related actions.\nIt neither exempted those causes of action from the claim\npresentation requirement nor altered when such actions\naccrued. (See Nelson v. Flintkote Co., supra, 172 Cal.App.3d\nat p. 730 [noting that prior to enactment of section 340.2,\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fasbestos-related causes of action were “governed by the\ngeneral one-year tort statute of limitations set forth in\nsection 340, subdivision (3) . . .”].) Thus, while section 340.2\nmodified the limitations period for commencing asbestos-\nrelated causes of action against both public and nonpublic\nentities, it did not modify the claim presentation deadline\nbecause it did not address the date of accrual for those\nactions. That date remains, as set forth in Supreme Court\nprecedent, the date the Jaureguis “discover[ed] or should\nreasonably have discovered” that Sandra was suffering from\nmesothelioma. (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.)\n      Lastly, we note our interpretation of Government Code\nsection 901 does not bar an action by a plaintiff who, years\nafter exposure to asbestos, discovers she has suffered a\ncompensable injury. It requires only that after making such\na discovery, she promptly present a claim to the\ngovernmental entity she seeks to hold responsible.9\n\n      We note that pending before the Supreme Court is\n9\n\n\nRubenstein v. Doe No. 1 (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1037 [2016\nCal.App. LEXIS 211], review granted June 15, 2016,\nS234269. During oral arguments before the court, the\nparties disputed whether the discovery rule would delay the\ndate of accrual of Rubenstein’s childhood sex abuse claim\nand thus render her claim timely under the Government\nClaims Act. No such issue is presented here, as the City\nconcedes the Jaureguis are entitled to the benefits of the\ndiscovery rule. More important, our holding incorporates the\ndiscovery rule. Under our holding, the six-month claim\npresentation deadline for asbestos-related disease is\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f                       DISPOSITION\n      Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing that\nrespondent superior court vacate its order overruling\npetitioner’s demurrer, and enter a new order sustaining\npetitioner’s demurrer in its entirety.

Code, § 810 et\nseq.), before commencing an action against a public entity, a\nplaintiff must present the claim to the entity within six\nmonths of “the date upon which the cause of action would be\ndeemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of\nlimitations which would be applicable thereto.” (Gov. Code,\n§ 901.) In the underlying action, real parties in interest\nSandra Reyes Jauregui and Mario Reyes Jauregui (the\nJaureguis) filed a first amended complaint (FAC), alleging a\ncause of action against petitioner City of Pasadena (the City)\narising from Sandra Jauregui’s mesothelioma. The City\ndemurred to the Jaureguis’ complaint, arguing that they had\nfailed to comply with the claim presentation requirement of\nthe Government Claims Act by not presenting their claim to\nthe City within six months of the date of Sandra’s\nmesothelioma diagnosis. The Jaureguis opposed the\ndemurrer, arguing that their claim presentation was timely\nbecause under the applicable statute of limitations -- Code of\n\n\n\n                              2\n\fCivil Procedure section 340.2 -- their cause of action never\naccrued.1 Thus, they asserted, the six-month claim\npresentation period never began to run. The trial court\noverruled the demurrer, and the City now seeks a writ\ndirecting the trial court to sustain the demurrer.\n      For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that “the\ndate upon which the cause of action would be deemed to\nhave accrued within the meaning of the [applicable] statute\nof limitations” is the date on which a plaintiff discovers or\nshould reasonably have discovered that she had suffered a\ncompensable injury. In this case, that date was no later\nthan the date Sandra was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\nBecause the Jaureguis presented their claim to the City\nmore than 10 months after that date, they failed to comply\nwith the claim presentation requirement. Accordingly, we\ngrant the petition for writ of mandate.\n\n      FACTUAL BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL\n                          HISTORY\n      On October 5, 2015, the Jaureguis filed a complaint for\npersonal injuries and loss of consortium against numerous\ndefendants, but not the City. The complaint alleged that\nSandra was diagnosed with mesothelioma on or about\nSeptember 25, 2015. She allegedly developed the disease as\na result of exposure to airborne asbestos that her father “was\n\n\n     All further statutory citations are to the Code of Civil\n1\n\n\nProcedure, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fexposed to and thereafter tracked into the family’s home and\nvehicles on his clothing, shoes, person, and personal effects.”\nThe complaint also alleged that Sandra’s father was a\nmechanic who worked with asbestos-containing products at\nvarious sites, including at “The City of Pasadena from about\n1980 to 1987.”\n       A year later, on October 14, 2016, the Jaureguis filed\ntheir FAC, adding the City as a defendant. The FAC alleged\na single cause of action against the City for dangerous\nconditions of public property. According to the FAC,\nSandra’s father worked for the City as a vehicle mechanic\nand was exposed to asbestos at various vehicle repair\nfacilities owned, controlled or managed by the City. The\nFAC further alleged that on August 22, 2016, the Jaureguis\npresented their claim to the City in compliance with the\nGovernment Claims Act.2\n       On November 17, 2016, the City demurred to the FAC.\nIt argued that the Jaureguis had failed to allege facts\ndemonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim\npresentation requirement set forth in Government Code\nsection 911.2, which requires that a claim be presented\nwithin six months of the accrual of the cause of action. The\nCity asserted that the Jaureguis’ causes of action accrued on\n\n      Although the FAC initially asserted Mario’s loss-of-\n2\n\n\nconsortium claim against the City, the Jaureguis agreed to\ndismiss that claim. Thus, the only claim against the City at\nissue is the cause of action based on allegedly dangerous\nconditions.\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fSeptember 25, 2015, the date when Sandra was diagnosed\nwith mesothelioma. However, the Jaureguis did not present\na claim to the City until August 22, 2016, nearly 11 months\nlater. Nor did they file a late-claim application.\nAccordingly, the City asserted, the Jaureguis failed to\ncomply with the claim presentation requirement and thus,\nthe demurrer should have been sustained without leave to\namend.\n       The City further argued that section 340.2, the\napplicable statute of limitations for the Jaureguis’ cause of\naction, did not render their claim presentation timely.\nAlthough the limitations period did not run because Sandra\nwas never disabled within the meaning of section 340.2, that\nsection “says nothing about the accrual of the cause of\naction.” Accordingly, the City asserted, section 340.2 did not\nprovide an accrual date other than the date of diagnosis.\n       The Jaureguis opposed the City’s demurrer, contending\nthere was no time limit on their claim presentation. They\nargued: “Sandra’s government claim had to be filed within\nsix months of the ‘accrual’ of her underlying tort causes of\naction -- a date statutorily defined for this purpose as the\ntrigger date for the underlying limitations period.” Because\nthat date was never triggered, “Sandra’s claims never\n‘accrued’ for purposes of filing a government claim.” They\nfurther argued that “accrual” has two different meanings --\n(1) “‘ripeness’” and (2) “‘beginning of the limitations period’” -\n- and “accrual” as used in Government Code section 901\nmeant the latter.\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      In reply, the City argued that section 340.2 did not\nequate “accrual” with the commencement of the limitations\nperiod. Although section 340.2 altered the limitations period\n-- the time during which a plaintiff may file a complaint -- it\nhad no impact on when a cause of action accrued. The City\nalso argued that nothing in section 340.2 reflects an intent\non the part of the Legislature to modify the claim\npresentation deadline in the Government Claims Act.\n      On December 15, 2016, the trial court overruled the\ndemurrer without explanation. However, at the hearing on\nthe demurrer, the court stated its belief that the term\n“accrual” as used in Government Code section 901 is “not\nused in the sense of a case being ripe so that somebody can\nsue.” Rather, it is used to mean “when a person must sue or\nlose their right,” i.e., when the limitations period\ncommences.\n      The City filed its petition on February 21, 2017,\nseeking an immediate stay of all proceedings and a\nperemptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to set\naside and vacate its order overruling the demurrer and to\nenter a new order sustaining the demurrer.3 In response to\n\n\n      Writ review is proper because a “significant legal issue\n3\n\n\nis presented, and the benefits of the claims act defense would\nbe effectively lost if defendant[] [was] forced to go to trial.”\n(City of Stockton v.

In Buttram v. Owens-\n\n\n      Other doctrines that alter the general accrual rule\n5\n\n\ninclude: (1) the continuous violation doctrine which treats a\nseries of wrongs or injuries as a single cause of action that\naccrues upon commission or sufferance of the last of them;\nand (2) the theory of continuous accrual, which segregates a\nseries of wrongs or injuries into separate causes of action,\neach accruing on a separate date. (Aryeh, supra, 55 Cal.4th\nat p. 1192.)\n\n\n\n                              11\n\fCorning Fiberglas Corp.

However, the discovery rule applies to delay the\naccrual of a cause of action for an asbestos-related disease.\nThus, the court observed, “for statute of limitations\npurposes, it is well settled that a cause of action for a latent\ninjury does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers or\nreasonably should have discovered that he has suffered a\ncompensable injury.” (Id. at p. 530, citing Velasquez v.\nFibreboard Paper Products Corp. (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n887-888.) In Hamilton, the court reaffirmed Buttram,\nstating: “[A] cause of action for a latent injury or disease\ngenerally accrues, in the sense that it is ripe for suit, when\nthe plaintiff discovers or should reasonably have discovered\nhe has suffered a compensable injury.” (Hamilton, supra, 22\nCal.4th at p. 1144.)\n      As the foregoing demonstrates, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations, “accrual” of an action is used in the\nsense of ripeness. This is also the ordinary and common\nunderstanding of the term “accrue.” In Webster’s Seventh\nNew Collegiate Dictionary (1969) page 6, the first definition\nof “accrue” is “to come into existence as a legally enforceable\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fclaim.”6 Likewise, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “accrue” as\n“To come into existence as an enforceable claim or right; to\narise <the plaintiff's cause of action for silicosis did not\naccrue until the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the\ndisease>.” (Black’s Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014).)7\n      In sum, we conclude that as used in Government Code\nsection 901, “the date upon which the cause of action would\nbe deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute\nof limitations which would be applicable” is the date on\nwhich the cause of action became actionable. In the instant\nmatter, the Jaureguis’ cause of action against the City\naccrued when Sandra discovered or reasonably should have\ndiscovered that she had suffered a compensable injury. That\ndate was no later than the date she was diagnosed with\nmesothelioma, September 25, 2015. However, the Jaureguis\ndid not present their claim to the City until August 22, 2016,\nmore than 10 months after Sandra was diagnosed. Thus,\nthey failed to comply with the six-month claim presentation\ndeadline set forth in Government Code section 911.2.\n\n\n      The other definitions are: “to come by way of increase\n6\n\n\nor addition” and “to be periodically accumulated whether as\nan increase or a decrease.” (Webster’s 7th New Collegiate\nDict., supra, at p. 6.)\n\n     Black’s Law Dictionary has only one other definition of\n7\n\n\n“accrue”: “To accumulate periodically; to increase over a\nperiod of time <the savings-account interest accrues\nmonthly>.”\n\n\n\n                              13\n\fAccordingly, their action against the City is barred, and the\nCity’s demurrer should have been sustained.\n      The Juareguis argue that under Government Code\nsection 901, “accrue” does not mean ripeness. Rather, they\ncontend, it means “commencement of the limitations period.”\nThey note that in Nelson v. Flintkote Co. (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the appellate court characterized section\n340.2 as a “delayed accrual rule.” (Nelson v. Flintkote Co., at\np. 735.) We acknowledge that many courts have used\n“accrue” or “accrual” when referring to the commencement of\nthe running of the statute of limitations. A likely reason for\nthe conflation of the two concepts is that in the vast majority\nof cases, the date an action accrues is also the date the\nstatute of limitations begins to run. Our Supreme Court has\nrecognized, however, that “the accrual of a cause of action” is\ndistinct from “the beginning of the limitations period.”\n(Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.) Thus, in Hamilton,\nthe court observed that it would be a “mistake[]” to “equate[]\nthe accrual of a cause of action for asbestos-related injury\nwith the beginning of the limitations period prescribed by\nsection 340.2.” (Ibid.) The court explained: “Before the\nenactment of section 340.2, [the] accrual date was also the\ndate of the beginning of the limitations period in cases in\nwhich the latent injury or disease arose from exposure to\nasbestos. [Citation.] But section 340.2 changed that rule,\ndeclaring a separate and distinct date for the beginning of\nthe limitations period in asbestos cases, i.e., the date of\ndisability as specially defined in the statute.” (Id. at pp.\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f1144-1145, italics omitted.) Notably, the Hamilton court\nnever used the term “accrual” when referring to the\nbeginning of the limitations period. In short, “[a]lthough\ncommentators have referred to [section 340.2] as providing\nfor a ‘postponed accrual’ date [citation], it is more accurately\ndescribed as a statute of repose -- a time in the future after\nwhich a claimant may not file suit because the claim\nbecomes stale.” (Barr v. Acands, Inc., supra, 57 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1049.)\n       The Jaureguis’ argument that “accrue” means only\n“commencement of the limitations period” would lead to the\nanomalous result that they could not bring the instant\naction. As noted, under section 340.2, the limitations period\nbegins to run on the date of “disability.” Because Sandra\nnever suffered a “disability,” the limitations period has never\nbegun to run, and under the Jaureguis’ interpretation their\ncause of action has not -- and never will -- accrue. However,\nunder section 312, “without exception,” an action may not be\nfiled until the underlying claim “shall have accrued.” Thus,\nthe Jaureguis could never bring a suit for an asbestos-\nrelated injury or illness. Like other courts, we reject such an\ninterpretation. (See Barr v. Acands, Inc., supra, 57\nCal.App.4th at p. 1049 [“If a claim for personal injuries\nallegedly resulting from asbestos exposure could not accrue\nuntil disability occurred, it would lead to the anomalous\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\fresult that plaintiffs who did not suffer disability as defined\nby the statute would be forever barred from filing suit.”].)8\n      The Jaureguis further argue that interpreting\n“accrued” to mean when a cause of action is ripe would\nrewrite Government Code section 901 to excise any reference\nto statutes of limitations. We disagree. In the context of\nstatutes of limitations, accrual refers to the settled common\nlaw accrual rules, including the discovery rule delaying\naccrual of a cause of action. (See Aryeh, supra, 55 Cal.4th at\np. 1193 [where statute of limitations uses term “accrued” but\nprovides no definition, we may assume “the Legislature\nintended the well-settled body of law that has built up\naround accrual, including the traditional last element rule\nand its equitable exceptions, to apply fully here”].) In\nButtram, the court noted that it was “well settled” that “for\nstatute of limitations purposes,” a cause of action for a latent\ninjury, such as asbestos-related mesothelioma, does not\naccrue “until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should\nhave discovered that [she] has suffered a compensable\ninjury.” (Buttram, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 530; accord,\nHamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.) Thus, construing\n“accrual” in Government Code section 901 as our Supreme\n\n     We note that the Legislature has not acted on Justice\n8\n\n\nBrown’s suggestion to revisit and revise the “cumbersome\nand confusing” language of section 340.2, which has created\nseveral “anomalous,” “bizarre” and likely unintended results.\n(See Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1152 (conc. opn. of\nBrown, J.).)\n\n\n\n                               16\n\fCourt has done “for statute of limitations purposes” is\nconsistent with the statutory language.\n       Finally, the Jaureguis contend that the intent and\npurpose of section 340.2 -- “to provide a unique and forgiving\nlimitations period to those suffering from an asbestos-related\nillness” -- warrants interpreting Government Code section\n901 to permit them to present an asbestos-related claim\nagainst the City at any time prior to filing their action\nagainst the City. However, the intent and purpose\nanimating section 340.2 must be balanced against the intent\nand purposes animating the Government Claims Act. As\nnoted, the purposes of the Government Claims Act are (1) to\nprovide the public entity with sufficient information to\nenable it to adequately investigate and settle claims, and (2)\nto enable the entity to account for potential liabilities and to\navoid similar liabilities in the future. (City of Stockton v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 738.) “Moreover, the\nintent of the Government Claims Act is ‘not to expand the\nrights of plaintiffs against government entities. Rather, the\nintent of the act is to confine potential governmental liability\nto rigidly delineated circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (DiCampli-\nMintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991.)\nAn unlimited claim presentation period expanding the rights\nof plaintiffs against government entities would frustrate the\nintent and purposes of the Government Claims Act. It could\nhamper a public entity from taking immediate remedial\naction -- such as using asbestos-free products -- and impede\nits fiscal planning. (See Johnson v. San Diego Unified\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fSchool Dist. (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696-697 [“‘claims\nstatute provides an opportunity to the public entity to\nquickly rectify a dangerous condition and . . . to take the\npotential claim into account in its fiscal planning’”].)\n      Moreover, the Juareguis have pointed to nothing in the\nlanguage or legislative history of section 340.2 to suggest\nthat the Legislature intended, sub silencio, to amend the six-\nmonth claim presentation deadline in the Government\nClaims Act. On this point, we find the 2002 amendment to\nsection 340.1 instructive. In 2002, the Legislature amended\nsection 340.1 by adding, inter alia, subdivision (c) which\nprovides that any claims for damages arising from childhood\nsex abuse that would otherwise be barred solely because the\napplicable statute of limitations has or had expired “is\nrevived, and, in that case, a cause of action may be\ncommenced within one year of January 1, 2003.” (§ 340.1,\nsubd. (c).) Subsequently, our Supreme Court was asked to\ndetermine whether a plaintiff who failed to present a timely\nclaim to a public entity could thereafter bring a claim for\nchildhood sex abuse against the entity under the amended\nsection 340.1. The court concluded the answer was “no.”\n(Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631047\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631047/shirk-v-vista-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n205 (Shirk), superseded by statute as stated in A.M. v.\nVentura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252.)\nThe court observed that section 340.1, subdivision (c) revived\nonly claims barred solely because of the applicable statute of\nlimitations. However, “the government claim presentation\ndeadline is not a statute of limitations.” Thus, section 340.1\n\n\n\n                              18\n\fdid not revive those claims barred by failure to comply with\nthe claim presentation requirement. (Shirk, supra, at p.\n213.)\n      Moreover, as the appellate court in S.M. v. Los Angeles\nUnified School Dist. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.M.)\nobserved, although section 340.1 extended “the time during\nwhich a victim of childhood sexual abuse may sue, . . . it [did]\nnot alter the cause of action’s accrual date, which is when\nthe molestation occurred subject to any applicable delayed\ndiscovery. [Citation.] It is the date of accrual that triggers\nthe government tort claim filing requirement, a predicate\nnot addressed by section 340.1.” (Id. at p. 721.)\n      Following Shirk, the Legislature enacted Government\nCode section 905, subdivision (m), adding childhood sex\nabuse claims “arising out of conduct occurring on or after\nJanuary 1, 2009” to those claims exempted from the\ngovernment claim presentation requirement. (See Gov.\nCode, § 905 [listing exempted claims].) Notably, the\nLegislature did not overrule Shirk’s holding for childhood\nabuse claims arising from conduct occurring prior to 2009.\n(See S.M., supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 721, fn. 6.) Nor did\nthe Legislature address the date of accrual for such claims.\n      Here, in enacting section 340.2, the Legislature\nextended the limitations period for asbestos-related actions.\nIt neither exempted those causes of action from the claim\npresentation requirement nor altered when such actions\naccrued. (See Nelson v. Flintkote Co., supra, 172 Cal.App.3d\nat p. 730 [noting that prior to enactment of section 340.2,\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fasbestos-related causes of action were “governed by the\ngeneral one-year tort statute of limitations set forth in\nsection 340, subdivision (3) . . .”].) Thus, while section 340.2\nmodified the limitations period for commencing asbestos-\nrelated causes of action against both public and nonpublic\nentities, it did not modify the claim presentation deadline\nbecause it did not address the date of accrual for those\nactions. That date remains, as set forth in Supreme Court\nprecedent, the date the Jaureguis “discover[ed] or should\nreasonably have discovered” that Sandra was suffering from\nmesothelioma. (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1144.)\n      Lastly, we note our interpretation of Government Code\nsection 901 does not bar an action by a plaintiff who, years\nafter exposure to asbestos, discovers she has suffered a\ncompensable injury. It requires only that after making such\na discovery, she promptly present a claim to the\ngovernmental entity she seeks to hold responsible.9\n\n      We note that pending before the Supreme Court is\n9\n\n\nRubenstein v. Doe No. 1 (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

During oral arguments before the court, the\nparties disputed whether the discovery rule would delay the\ndate of accrual of Rubenstein’s childhood sex abuse claim\nand thus render her claim timely under the Government\nClaims Act. No such issue is presented here, as the City\nconcedes the Jaureguis are entitled to the benefits of the\ndiscovery rule. More important, our holding incorporates the\ndiscovery rule.
