Altonaga, United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\f      Ingrid Reeves appeals the entry of summary judgment in favor of C.H.\n\nRobinson Worldwide, Inc. (“CHRW”) on her hostile work environment sexual\n\nharassment claim. We must determine whether daily exposure to language and\n\nradio programming that are particularly offensive to women but not targeted at the\n\nplaintiff are sufficient to satisfy the “based on” and “severe or pervasive” elements\n\nof a hostile work environment claim. Because Reeves satisfied the “based on”\n\nelement and a jury could reasonably conclude that the conduct at issue was\n\nsufficiently pervasive to support a hostile work environment claim, we reverse the\n\nentry of summary judgment in CHRW’s favor.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n      In July 2001, Reeves began working as a Transportation Sales\n\nRepresentative (“TSR”) in CHRW’s Birmingham, Alabama branch office. She\n\nwas the only female TSR in the office, and she worked in a workstation pod\n\ncubicle near other TSRs. Only one other woman worked at the Birmingham\n\nbranch office, but her desk was not in Reeves’s pod.\n\n      Reeves alleges that sexually offensive language permeated the work\n\nenvironment in her pod at CHRW every day. She testified in her deposition that\n\nfrom the summer of 2001 to the spring of 2004, she “could point at every day of\n\nthe year that some of this behavior went on. It went on every day.” [Doc. 12-3: 7].\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fShe asserts, moreover, that sexually explicit radio programming playing on a daily\n\nbasis and her one-time exposure to a pornographic image of a woman on a co-\n\nworker’s computer also support her claim. Reeves testified that the offensive\n\nlanguage and radio programming continued even after she complained to co-\n\nworkers and her supervisor on several occasions.\n\n      One of Reeves’s co-workers frequently used sexually crude language that\n\noffended her. This employee “was consistent, [a]cross the board, day in and day\n\nout, in the sexually offensive language, phrases, jokes, songs, comments, remarks.”\n\n[Doc. 12-2: 41]. He often used the phrase “fucking bitch” or “fucking whore” after\n\nhanging up the phone, [id. at 42, 50]; he once called the only other female\n\nemployee in the office a “bitch” after she had left the room, and he once remarked\n\nthat she had “a big ass.” [Id. at 44]. Sexual jokes by this co-worker were also\n\ncommonplace, including one for which the punch-line was “fuck your sister and\n\nyour mother is a whore.” [Id. at 49-50]. Finally, he once said, “she’s a cunt,”\n\nreferring to a female. [Doc. 12-3: 10]. Reeves communicated to this co-worker on\n\nmultiple occasions that the language made it difficult for her to work, but the\n\nemployee did not change his behavior.\n\n      Another co-worker also offended Reeves when he used sexually crude\n\nlanguage. Reeves overheard this employee talk about (1) “getting off” in reference\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fto masturbation, [id. at 1], (2) a song that referenced “women’s teeth on a man’s\n\ndick,” [id.], and (3) an experience in a hotel with naked women, [id. at 1–2]. On\n\nthe day before this co-worker’s last day at the office, moreover, Reeves was told\n\nthat she should bring earplugs to work the next day because the co-worker had said\n\nthat he could behave however he wanted on his last day. [Id. at 1]. Reeves\n\ntestified that the co-worker’s last day “was just like any other day: full of sexually\n\noffensive remarks, comments, stories, conversation, language—just like any other\n\nday . . . .” [Id.].\n\n        The branch manager, who was Reeves’s direct supervisor, also made\n\ncomments that offended Reeves. He once referred to a former female co-worker as\n\na “lazy, good-for-nothing bitch,” [Doc. 12-2: 52], and another time asked Reeves\n\nto “talk to that stupid bitch on line four,” referring to a female customer. [Doc. 12-\n\n3: 5]. He once said, referring to the only female employee other than Reeves,\n\n“[s]he may be a bitch, but she can read,” [Doc. 12-2: 167], and on another occasion\n\nsaid “[s]he’s got a big one,” [id.], referring to her buttocks. Reeves often\n\ncomplained to the branch manager about both his use of offensive language and the\n\nuse of such language in the office generally.\n\n        Reeves was also offended by a radio program that was played every morning\n\non the stereo in the office. Discussions of the following material on the show\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\foffended her: (1) breast size of female celebrities and Playboy Playmates; (2)\n\nsexual arousal and women’s nipples as indications thereof; (3) masturbation, both\n\nin general and with animals; (4) erotic dreams; (5) ejaculation; and (6) female\n\npornography. [Id. at 14–18]. Advertisements for or including the following\n\nmaterial that were aired during the program also offended her: (1) sexual favors;\n\n(2) a bikini contest that instructed women to wear their most perverse bikinis; (3) a\n\nstatement that a woman was found in bed with three elves and a candy cane; and\n\n(4) a drug called Proton that promised to increase sexual performance, please a\n\npartner, and make the user a “sexual tyrannosaurus rex.” [Id. at 19-21]. When\n\nReeves complained about the radio programming, she was often told that she could\n\nplay her own music or change the station. She testified, however, that if she did so\n\nthe other employees would soon change the radio back to the offensive program.\n\n      The branch manager testified in his deposition that he had used, and heard\n\nothers use, the term “bitch” in the office. He could not recall hearing anyone in the\n\noffice use “whore” in a sexual context. He denied hearing any employee use the\n\nword “cunt” but estimated that the word “dick” was used about once a week. He\n\nalso testified that he had one or two talks with one of Reeves’s co-workers about\n\nlanguage, and mentioned language to others during performance evaluations after\n\nReeves complained.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      Reeves resigned from CHRW on March 24, 2004. In February 2006, she\n\nfiled a complaint against CHRW alleging in part that the use of sexually offensive\n\nlanguage created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. The district\n\ncourt entered summary judgment for CHRW on the ground that the alleged\n\nharassment was not “based on” Reeves’s sex.\n\n      On appeal, Reeves asserts that, contrary to the district court’s reasoning,\n\nwhether the allegedly harassing language was directed at the plaintiff is not\n\ndeterminative of whether the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment.\n\nCHRW argues that we should affirm the district court because men and women\n\nwere subjected to the same behavior in the office. Alternatively, CHRW argues\n\nthat this Court should affirm on the ground that the harassment was not severe or\n\npervasive.\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment, viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Chambless v.\n\nLouisiana-Pacific Corp., 481 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir. 2007). Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\n\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fjudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party opposing summary\n\njudgment must make “enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for\n\nthat party.” Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n      Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.,\n\nprohibits employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or\n\nnational origin.” Id. § 2000e-2(a)(1). The ground for a Title VII sexual\n\nharassment claim can be either a tangible employment action or, as Reeves asserts\n\nhere, the “creation of a hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment that\n\nis sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of work.”\n\nBaldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala., 480 F.3d 1287, 1300 (11th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, — U.S. —, 128 S. Ct. 499, — L. Ed. 2d. — (2007). An employee cannot\n\nrecover under the hostile work environment theory unless she shows that (1) she\n\nbelongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome sexual\n\nharassment; (3) the harassment was based on her membership in a protected group;\n\n(4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and\n\nconditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5)\n\na basis for holding the employer liable exists. Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d\n\n1238, 1245 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). The only elements at issue here are the\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f“based on” and “severe or pervasive” elements.\n\nA. “Based on”\n\n      The Supreme Court has declared that in hostile work environment cases,\n\n“‘[t]he critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to\n\ndisadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other\n\nsex are not exposed.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80,\n\n118 S. Ct. 998, 1002, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998) (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys.,\n\nInc., 510 U.S. 17, 25, 114 S. Ct. 367, 372, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) (Ginsburg, J.,\n\nconcurring)). Thus, to satisfy the “based on” element, a plaintiff must essentially\n\nshow “‘that similarly situated persons not of [her] sex were treated differently and\n\nbetter.’” Baldwin, 480 F.3d at 1302 (alteration in original) (quoting Mendoza, 195\n\nF.3d at 1254 n.3 (Edmondson, J., concurring)).\n\n      The specific question that faces us here is whether harassment in the form of\n\noffensive language can be “based on” the plaintiff’s membership in a protected\n\ngroup even when the plaintiff was not the target of the language and other\n\nemployees were equally exposed to the language. We noted in Baldwin that “sex\n\nspecific” profanity, including words such as “bitch,” “tramp,” and “slut,” is “more\n\ndegrading to women than to men” and thus “may be considered, for whatever\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fweight [it has] on the sexual harassment scales.” Id. at 1302.1 Though we have\n\nnever explicitly held that such “sex specific” language satisfies the “based on”\n\nelement in a sexual harassment hostile work environment case even when the\n\nlanguage does not target the plaintiff, we do so today in light of our race-\n\ndiscrimination cases.\n\n       It is well established that racially offensive language need not be targeted at\n\nthe plaintiff in order to support a Title VII hostile work environment claim. For\n\nexample, in Walker v. Ford Motor Co., 684 F.2d 1355 (11th Cir. 1982), the\n\nplaintiff, a black male, who had just begun working as a trainee at a car dealership,\n\nclaimed that other employees repeatedly used offensive racial epithets, including\n\nreferences to poorly repaired cars as “nigger-rigged” and to the salesman with the\n\nlowest sales volume as “the black ass.” Id. at 1358. We concluded that the fact\n\nthat many of the epithets were not directed at Walker was not determinative\n\nbecause the offensive language was often used in Walker’s presence after he had\n\nvoiced objections. Id. at 1359 n.2.2 The harassment that Walker experienced was\n\n\n       1\n         The district court did not have the benefit of this reasoning from Baldwin because it\nentered summary judgment for CHRW before we decided Baldwin.\n       2\n         Similarly, in Rogers v. E.E.O.C., 454 F.2d 234, 236 (5th Cir. 1972), disapproved of on\nother grounds, E.E.O.C. v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.S. 54, 104 S. Ct. 1621, 80 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1984),\nthe former Fifth Circuit considered an optometrist employee’s Title VII claim based on the\nemployer’s segregation of patients from a minority group of which the employee was a member.\nId. The Court declared that the employer’s failure to intentionally direct any discriminatory\ntreatment toward the employee was “not material.” Id. at 239. See also, Busby v. City of\n\n                                                9\n\f“based on” his race because the “race specific” language that was used was\n\nparticularly offensive to him as a black male, regardless of whom the language\n\ntargeted.3\n\n       Our Walker reasoning can correctly be extended here. The language in the\n\nCHRW office included the “sex specific” words “bitch,” “whore,” and “cunt” that,\n\nunder Baldwin, may be more degrading to women than men. The subject matter of\n\nthe conversations and jokes that allegedly permeated the office on a daily basis\n\nincluded male and female sexual anatomy, masturbation, and female pornography,\n\nall of which was discussed in a manner that was similarly more degrading to\n\nwomen than men. The radio programming that Reeves claims was also similar.\n\nTherefore, even if such language was used indiscriminately in the office such that\n\nmen and women were equally exposed to the language, the language had a\n\ndiscriminatory effect on Reeves because of its degrading nature. Accordingly, just\n\nas the language in Walker was sufficient to support Walker’s hostile work\n\nOrlando, 931 F.2d 764, 785 (11th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (reiterating the Walker principle).\n       3\n          Our sister circuits have also recognized the importance of this principle, for both the\n“based on” and “severe or pervasive” elements, and in both the race- and sex-discrimination\ncontexts. See, e.g., Jennings v. Univ. of North Carolina, 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir.) (en banc)\n(“[S]exually charged comments . . . even if not directed specifically to the plaintiff, are relevant\nto determining whether the plaintiff was subjected to sex-based harassment.”), cert. denied, —\nU.S. —, 128 S. Ct. 247, — L. Ed. 2d — (2007); Jackson v. Quanex Corp., 191 F.3d 647, 660\n(6th Cir. 1999) (“[O]ffensive comments need not be directed at a plaintiff in order to constitute\nconduct violating Title VII.”); Monteiro v. Tempe Union High Sch. Dist., 158 F.3d 1022,\n1033–34 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Walker for the proposition that “racist attacks need not be\ndirected at the complainant in order to create a hostile . . . environment”).\n\n                                                 10\n\fenvironment claim because it particularly offended Walker as a black man, we hold\n\nthat the evidence Reeves presented was sufficient to survive summary judgment on\n\nthe “based on” element here.\n\n      CHRW argues that we should not look to race cases here because, “race is\n\ndifferent” than sex. In the Title VII context, however, CHRW’s argument is\n\nsimply misplaced. We have made it abundantly clear that\n\n      [s]exual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment\n      for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual\n      equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality.\n      Surely, a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual\n      abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a\n      living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial\n      epithets.\n\nHenson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (11th Cir. 1982). The Supreme\n\nCourt, moreover, drew upon race discrimination cases when it held that Title VII\n\ncovered hostile work environment claims and has “followed the lead of such cases\n\nin attempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to\n\nconstitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute.” Faragher v. City of\n\nBoca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998).\n\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has noted that it is proper for us as we decide\n\nsexual harassment cases to draw “on standards developed in cases involving racial\n\nharassment.” Id. at 787 n.2, 118 S. Ct. at 2283 n.2. Accordingly, we see no reason\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fto analyze the “based on” element differently here than we would in a race\n\ndiscrimination case.\n\n      Having concluded that Reeves satisfied the “based on” element, we turn to\n\nthe “severe or pervasive” element.\n\nB. “Severe or Pervasive”\n\n      CHRW argues that even if the harassment was “based on” Reeves’s sex,\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate because, as a matter of law, the harassment\n\nwas not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of\n\nReeves’s employment. We disagree.\n\n      The “severe or pervasive” element “tests the mettle of most sexual\n\nharassment claims.” Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 583 (11th Cir.\n\n2000). Thus, when properly applied, this element will “filter out complaints\n\nattacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of\n\nabusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.” Faragher, 524\n\nU.S. at 788, 118 S. Ct. at 2284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The element is\n\nonly satisfied, moreover, “[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370.\n\n      The “severe or pervasive” element “includes a subjective and an objective\n\ncomponent.” Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1246. We have no doubt that Reeves\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fsubjectively perceived the harassment to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nviolate Title VII. The question before us is whether that perception was\n\nobjectively unreasonable as a matter of law such that the district court\n\nappropriately entered summary judgment in CHRW’s favor.\n\n       We must judge the objective severity of the harassment from the perspective\n\nof a reasonable person in Reeves’s position, considering the totality of the\n\ncircumstances rather than acts in isolation. Id. As we have recognized, this\n\ninquiry is somewhat fact-intensive, id., but the Supreme Court has identified the\n\nfollowing four factors to guide us in our analysis: (1) the frequency of the conduct;\n\n(2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or\n\nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct\n\nunreasonably interferes with the employee’s job performance. Faragher, 524 U.S.\n\nat 787–88, 118 S. Ct. at 2283. Importantly, no single factor is determinative,\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S. Ct. at 371, and either severity or pervasiveness can\n\nsatisfy the element, if sufficient. See Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1247–48.4\n\n\n       4\n         Again, our sister circuits agree with us concerning this proposition. See, e.g., E.E.O.C.\nv. WC&M Enters., Inc., 496 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir. 2007) (“Under the totality of the\ncircumstances test, a single incident of harassment, if sufficiently severe, could give rise to a\nviable Title VII claim as well as a continuous pattern of much less severe incidents of\nharassment.”); Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 148 (2d Cir. 2003) (recognizing that the test is\nfor “quality or quantity” of harassment (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted));\nCerros v. Steel Techs., Inc., 288 F.3d 1040, 1047 (7th Cir. 2002) (“[A] sufficiently severe\nepisode may occur as rarely as once, while a relentless pattern of lesser harassment that extends\nover a long period of time also violates the statute.” (citation omitted)); Bowen v. Missouri Dep’t\n\n                                                13\n\f         1. Frequency\n\n         For nearly three years, CHRW employees allegedly used “sex specific”\n\nlanguage in Reeves’s presence every day and the offensive radio program was\n\nplayed every morning. The frequency factor thus undoubtedly weighs in Reeves’s\n\nfavor.\n\n         2. Severity\n\n         As for severity, the words and phrases that were used fall variously on the\n\nspectrum of language that is particularly offensive to women. Rather than consider\n\nthe severity of each instance of alleged harassment, however, we must determine\n\nthe severity of all the circumstances taken together. It is arguably severe for the\n\nsole woman in a workplace to be exposed to: (1) the words “cunt” and “whore;”\n\n(2) vulgar references to sexual acts such as “a woman’s teeth on a man’s dick” and\n\n“fuck your sister;” and (3) conversations concerning ejaculation, men’s erotic\n\ndreams, female sexual anatomy, sources and indications of female sexual arousal,\n\nand female pornography. Because the alleged conduct was never directed at\n\nReeves, however, we cannot say that the nature of the overall harassment here was\n\nas objectively severe as the conduct that we and our sister circuits have previously\n\n\nof Soc. Servs., 311 F.3d 878, 884 (8th Cir. 2002) (“A claimant need only establish discriminatory\nconduct which is either pervasive or severe.”); Smith v. Norwest Fin. Acceptance, Inc., 129 F.3d\n1408, 1413 (10th Cir. 1997) (“The [Supreme Court’s] test is a disjunctive one, requiring that the\nharassing conduct be sufficiently pervasive or sufficiently severe . . . .”).\n\n                                               14\n\fdeemed actionable under the severity factor. See Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1246–52.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that, while it is not determinative,5 the severity factor\n\nweighs against Reeves.\n\n       3. Physically Threatening or Humiliating\n\n       Nothing occurred in the office that was physically threatening.6\n\nNevertheless, a jury could find that the language and radio programming created an\n\nobjectively humiliating work environment, particularly because Reeves was the\n\nonly woman in the workstation pod. Given the conduct described in our discussion\n\nof the severity factor, it is objectively reasonable that a woman in Reeves’s\n\nposition would have felt humiliated in such circumstances. Reeves’s exposure to\n\nthe pornographic image on her co-worker’s computer also contributed to the\n\nobjectively humiliating environment.\n\n       The humiliating atmosphere is further revealed in the warning that Reeves\n\nreceived from a co-worker who used offensive language concerning another\n\n\n       5\n          Our reasoning in Walker makes clear that whether offensive language is directed at the\nplaintiff is not determinative, even in the “severe or pervasive” analysis. See Walker, 684 F.3d\nat 1358, 1359 n.2; see also, cases cited supra, note 3.\n       6\n         Because this factor requires that we consider whether the harassing conduct was\nphysically threatening or humiliating, we agree with the Fourth Circuit that the absence of\nphysical threats “is in no way dispositive, when there is sufficient evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude that allegedly harassing conduct was otherwise humiliating.”\nWhite v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 298–99 n.6 (4th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n                                               15\n\foffensive co-worker’s last day of work. The earplugs comment suggests that those\n\nwho used derogatory language in the office knew that their conduct made Reeves\n\nuncomfortable, and perhaps even intended to do so. It is certainly reasonable that\n\nsuch treatment would be humiliating for a woman in Reeves’s position.\n\nAccordingly, this factor weighs in Reeves’s favor, despite the lack of physically\n\nthreatening conduct.\n\n      4. Unreasonable Interference with Job Performance\n\n      Finally, we believe that a jury could properly conclude that the conduct\n\nunreasonably interfered with Reeves’s job performance. CHRW argues that this\n\nfactor should weigh in its favor because Reeves received positive performance\n\nreviews and was given significant responsibilities. As the Supreme Court declared\n\nin Harris, however, the conduct in question need not have tangibly affected the\n\nplaintiff’s job performance in order to be actionable. Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114\n\nS. Ct. at 371. Reeves testified that the conduct made it difficult to concentrate on\n\nwork and caused her to leave the pod and stand in the hallway. She claims that she\n\nstarted to shake when she saw the pornographic image on her co-worker’s\n\ncomputer. She also often took time away from her work to complain to her\n\nsuperiors, ask her co-workers to stop, or write notes to herself so she would have a\n\nrecord of some of the more offensive incidents. This factor, therefore, also weighs\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fin Reeves’s favor.\n\n      5. Our “Severe or Pervasive” Determination\n\n      After considering the Supreme Court’s four factors in light of the totality of\n\nthe circumstances in which Reeves worked at CHRW, we hold that a reasonable\n\njury could find that the harassment Reeves faced was sufficiently pervasive to alter\n\nthe conditions of her employment. We agree with the Sixth Circuit that “a work\n\nenvironment viewed as a whole may satisfy the legal definition of an abusive work\n\nenvironment, for purposes of a hostile environment claim, even though no single\n\nepisode crosses the Title VII threshold.” Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp., 187 F.3d\n\n553, 564 (6th Cir. 1999). Reeves has presented evidence of sufficient\n\npervasiveness to survive summary judgment, even if none of the incidents she has\n\ndescribed, standing alone, would be actionable. Accordingly, this case can only be\n\nappropriately resolved after a jury weighs the factors and decides whether the\n\nharassment was such that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the\n\nconditions of her employment.\n\n      We recognize that the conduct at issue here is not what typically comes to\n\nmind when one thinks of sexual harassment under Title VII. We were careful in\n\nMendoza, moreover, not to “establish a baseline of actionable conduct that is far\n\nbelow that established by other circuits,” Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1251, or “trivialize\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\ftrue instances of sexual harassment.” Id. at 1252 n.10. Furthermore, summary\n\njudgment is meant to “police [that] baseline for hostile environment claims.” Id. at\n\n1244. Nevertheless, what Reeves experienced at CHRW was not the “ordinary\n\nsocializing,” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.\n\nCt. 998, 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998), or “ordinary tribulations of the\n\nworkplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and\n\noccasional teasing” that the “severe or pervasive” element is meant to filter out.\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S. Ct. at 2284.\n\n       As we mentioned earlier, either severity or pervasiveness can form the basis\n\nof a hostile work environment claim, and our holding today focuses on the latter.\n\nWhile it would be impossible to find a prior case that perfectly supports our\n\nreasoning, two of our sister circuits have held that similar facts satisfied the “severe\n\nor pervasive” element on pervasiveness specifically.\n\n       In Lauderdale v. Texas Dep’t of Criminal Justice, No. 06-41636, 2007 WL\n\n4465204, at *1 (5th Cir. December 21, 2007), the Fifth Circuit recently held that\n\nevidence of frequent but non-severe harassment was sufficiently pervasive to\n\nsurvive summary judgment. The relevant harassment in Lauderdale consisted of\n\nmultiple nightly phone calls from the plaintiff’s supervisor for nearly four months.7\n\n\n       7\n          The plaintiff also alleged other instances of harassment, but the Court did not consider\nthose in its pervasiveness analysis. Lauderdale, 2007 WL 4465204 at *3.\n\n                                                18\n\fId. at *3. While the calls clearly indicated the supervisor’s romantic interest in the\n\nplaintiff, the call that was most sexual in nature merely invited the plaintiff to\n\ntravel to Las Vegas with the supervisor and “snuggle.” Id. In reversing the district\n\ncourt’s entry of summary judgment, the Fifth Circuit panel declared that frequent\n\nharassment can be sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment even\n\nif the individual incidents of harassment are “not severe.” Id.\n\n      In Dominguez-Curry v. Nevada Transp. Dep’t, 424 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir.\n\n2005), the Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion when it was faced with\n\nevidence of pervasiveness. The plaintiff testified that her supervisor told sexually\n\nexplicit jokes “like every day,” id. at 1035 (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n\nthat she “could write a book” about all the times her supervisor had said that he did\n\nnot think the plaintiff, or a female generally, could do the work that a man is\n\nrequired to do. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit panel\n\nheld that the evidence of sexually explicit jokes and demeaning comments was\n\n“more than sufficient” to create “genuine factual disputes . . . as to both the\n\nseverity and pervasiveness of [the supervisor’s] conduct.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n      Just as the plaintiffs did in Lauderdale and Dominguez-Curry, Reeves has\n\npresented evidence of pervasive conduct that is sufficient to survive summary\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      The evidence that Reeves presented prevents us from holding that, as a\n\nmatter of law, the conduct in question did not satisfy the “based on” or “severe or\n\npervasive” elements of a hostile work environment claim. The entry of summary\n\njudgment in CHRW’s favor is thus reversed, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f",

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (\"CHRW\") on her hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. We must determine whether daily exposure to language and radio programming that are particularly offensive to women but not targeted at the plaintiff are sufficient to satisfy the \"based on\" and \"severe or pervasive\" elements of a hostile work environment claim. Because Reeves satisfied the \"based on\" element and a jury could reasonably conclude that the conduct at issue was sufficiently pervasive to support a hostile work environment claim, we reverse the entry of summary judgment in CHRW's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In July 2001, Reeves began working as a Transportation Sales Representative (\"TSR\") in CHRW's Birmingham, Alabama branch office. She was the only female TSR in the office, and she worked in a workstation pod cubicle near other TSRs. Only one other woman worked at the Birmingham branch office, but her desk was not in Reeves's pod.</p>\n<p>Reeves alleges that sexually offensive language permeated the work environment in her pod at CHRW every day. She testified in her deposition that from the summer of 2001 to the spring of 2004, she \"could point at every day of the year that some of this behavior went on. It went on every day.\" [Doc. 12-3: 7]. She asserts, moreover, that sexually explicit radio programming playing on a daily basis and her one-time exposure to a pornographic image of a woman on a co-worker's computer also support her claim. Reeves testified that the offensive language and radio programming continued even after she complained to co-workers and her supervisor on several occasions.</p>\n<p>One of Reeves's co-workers frequently used sexually crude language that offended her. This employee \"was consistent, [a]cross the board, day in and day out, in the sexually offensive language, phrases, jokes, songs, comments, remarks.\" [Doc. 12-2: 41]. He often used the phrase \"fucking bitch\" or \"fucking whore\" after hanging up the phone, [<i>id.</i> at 42, 50]; he once called the only other female employee in the office a \"bitch\" after she had left the room, and he once remarked that she had \"a big ass.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 44]. Sexual jokes by this co-worker were also commonplace, including one for which the punch-line was \"fuck your sister and your mother is a whore.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 49-50]. Finally, he once said, \"she's a cunt,\" referring to a female. [Doc. 12-3: 10]. Reeves communicated to this co-worker on multiple occasions that the language made it difficult for her to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1142</span> work, but the employee did not change his behavior.</p>\n<p>Another co-worker also offended Reeves when he used sexually crude language. Reeves overheard this employee talk about (1) \"getting off\" in reference to masturbation, [<i>id.</i> at 1], (2) a song that referenced \"women's teeth on a man's dick,\" [<i>id.</i>], and (3) an experience in a hotel with naked women, [<i>id.</i> at 1-2]. On the day before this co-worker's last day at the office, moreover, Reeves was told that she should bring earplugs to work the next day because the co-worker had said that he could behave however he wanted on his last day. [<i>Id.</i> at 1]. Reeves testified that the co-worker's last day \"was just like any other day: full of sexually offensive remarks, comments, stories, conversation, languagejust like any other day . . . .\" [<i>Id.</i>].</p>\n<p>The branch manager, who was Reeves's direct supervisor, also made comments that offended Reeves. He once referred to a former female co-worker as a \"lazy, good-for-nothing bitch,\" [Doc. 12-2: 52], and another time asked Reeves to \"talk to that stupid bitch on line four,\" referring to a female customer. [Doc. 12-3: 5]. He once said, referring to the only female employee other than Reeves, \"[s]he may be a bitch, but she can read,\" [Doc. 12-2: 167], and on another occasion said \"[s]he's got a big one,\" [<i>id.</i>], referring to her buttocks. Reeves often complained to the branch manager about both his use of offensive language and the use of such language in the office generally.</p>\n<p>Reeves was also offended by a radio program that was played every morning on the stereo in the office. Discussions of the following material on the show offended her: (1) breast size of female celebrities and Playboy Playmates; (2) sexual arousal and women's nipples as indications thereof; (3) masturbation, both in general and with animals; (4) erotic dreams; (5) ejaculation; and (6) female pornography. [<i>Id.</i> at 14-18]. Advertisements for or including the following material that were aired during the program also offended her: (1) sexual favors; (2) a bikini contest that instructed women to wear their most perverse bikinis; (3) a statement that a woman was found in bed with three elves and a candy cane; and (4) a drug called Proton that promised to increase sexual performance, please a partner, and make the user a \"sexual tyrannosaurus rex.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 19-21]. When Reeves complained about the radio programming, she was often told that she could play her own music or change the station. She testified, however, that if she did so the other employees would soon change the radio back to the offensive program.</p>\n<p>The branch manager testified in his deposition that he had used, and heard others use, the term \"bitch\" in the office. He could not recall hearing anyone in the office use \"whore\" in a sexual context. He denied hearing any employee use the word \"cunt\" but estimated that the word \"dick\" was used about once a week. He also testified that he had one or two talks with one of Reeves's co-workers about language, and mentioned language to others during performance evaluations after Reeves complained.</p>\n<p>Reeves resigned from CHRW on March 24, 2004. In February 2006, she filed a complaint against CHRW alleging in part that the use of sexually offensive language created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. The district court entered summary judgment for CHRW on the ground that the alleged harassment was not \"based on\" Reeves's sex.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Reeves asserts that, contrary to the district court's reasoning, whether the allegedly harassing language was directed at the plaintiff is not determinative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1143</span> of whether the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment. CHRW argues that we should affirm the district court because men and women were subjected to the same behavior in the office. Alternatively, CHRW argues that this Court should affirm on the ground that the harassment was not severe or pervasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Chambless v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp.,</i> 481 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The party opposing summary judgment must make \"enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.\" <i>Walker v. Darby,</i> 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2000e-2(a)(1). The ground for a Title VII sexual harassment claim can be either a tangible employment action or, as Reeves asserts here, the \"creation of a hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of work.\" <i>Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala.,</i> 480 F.3d 1287, 1300 (11th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 499, 169 L.Ed.2d 341 (2007). An employee cannot recover under the hostile work environment theory unless she shows that (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her membership in a protected group; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5) a basis for holding the employer liable exists. <i>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc.,</i> 195 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The only elements at issue here are the \"based on\" and \"severe or pervasive\" elements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. \"Based on\"</i></h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has declared that in hostile work environment cases, \"`[t]he critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.'\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 1002, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 25, 114 S.Ct. 367, 372, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). Thus, to satisfy the \"based on\" element, a plaintiff must essentially show \"`that similarly situated persons not of [her] sex were treated differently and better.'\" <i>Baldwin,</i> 480 F.3d at 1302 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1254 n. 3 (Edmondson, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>The specific question that faces us here is whether harassment in the form of offensive language can be \"based on\" the plaintiff's membership in a protected group even when the plaintiff was not the target of the language and other employees were equally exposed to the language. We noted in <i>Baldwin</i> that \"sex specific\" profanity, including words such as \"bitch,\" \"tramp,\" and \"slut,\" is \"more degrading to women than to men\" and thus \"may be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1144</span> considered, for whatever weight [it has] on the sexual harassment scales.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1302.<sup>[1]</sup> Though we have never explicitly held that such \"sex specific\" language satisfies the \"based on\" element in a sexual harassment hostile work environment case even when the language does not target the plaintiff, we do so today in light of our race-discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>It is well established that racially offensive language need not be targeted at the plaintiff in order to support a Title VII hostile work environment claim. For example, in <i>Walker v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 684 F.2d 1355 (11th Cir.1982), the plaintiff, a black male, who had just begun working as a trainee at a car dealership, claimed that other employees repeatedly used offensive racial epithets, including references to poorly repaired cars as \"nigger-rigged\" and to the salesman with the lowest sales volume as \"the black ass.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1358. We concluded that the fact that many of the epithets were not directed at Walker was not determinative because the offensive language was often used in Walker's presence after he had voiced objections. <i>Id.</i> at 1359 n. 2.<sup>[2]</sup> The harassment that Walker experienced was \"based on\" his race because the \"race specific\" language that was used was particularly offensive to him as a black male, regardless of whom the language targeted.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Our <i>Walker</i> reasoning can correctly be extended here. The language in the CHRW office included the \"sex specific\" words \"bitch,\" \"whore,\" and \"cunt\" that, under <i>Baldwin,</i> may be more degrading to women than men. The subject matter of the conversations and jokes that allegedly permeated the office on a daily basis included male and female sexual anatomy, masturbation, and female pornography, all of which was discussed in a manner that was similarly more degrading to women than men. The radio programming that Reeves claims was also similar. Therefore, even if such language was used indiscriminately in the office such that men and women were equally exposed to the language, the language had a discriminatory effect on Reeves because of its degrading nature. Accordingly, just as the language in <i>Walker</i> was sufficient to support Walker's hostile work environment claim because it particularly offended Walker as a black man, we hold that the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1145</span> Reeves presented was sufficient to survive summary judgment on the \"based on\" element here.</p>\n<p>CHRW argues that we should not look to race cases here because, \"race is different\" than sex. In the Title VII context, however, CHRW's argument is simply misplaced. We have made it abundantly clear that</p>\n<blockquote>[s]exual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality. Surely, a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Henson v. City of Dundee,</i> 682 F.2d 897, 902 (11th Cir.1982). The Supreme Court, moreover, drew upon race discrimination cases when it held that Title VII covered hostile work environment claims and has \"followed the lead of such cases in attempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute.\" <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). Additionally, the Supreme Court has noted that it is proper for us as we decide sexual harassment cases to draw \"on standards developed in cases involving racial harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 787 n. 2, 118 S.Ct. at 2283 n. 2. Accordingly, we see no reason to analyze the \"based on\" element differently here than we would in a race discrimination case.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Reeves satisfied the \"based on\" element, we turn to the \"severe or pervasive\" element.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. \"Severe or Pervasive\"</i></h2>\n<p>CHRW argues that even if the harassment was \"based on\" Reeves's sex, summary judgment was appropriate because, as a matter of law, the harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of Reeves's employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The \"severe or pervasive\" element \"tests the mettle of most sexual harassment claims.\" <i>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 212 F.3d 571, 583 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, when properly applied, this element will \"filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. at 2284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The element is only satisfied, moreover, \"[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370.</p>\n<p>The \"severe or pervasive\" element \"includes a subjective and an objective component.\" <i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1246. We have no doubt that Reeves subjectively perceived the harassment to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to violate Title VII. The question before us is whether that perception was objectively unreasonable as a matter of law such that the district court appropriately entered summary judgment in CHRW's favor.</p>\n<p>We must judge the objective severity of the harassment from the perspective of a reasonable person in Reeves's position, considering the totality of the circumstances rather than acts in isolation. <i>Id.</i> As we have recognized, this inquiry is somewhat fact-intensive, <i>id.,</i> but the Supreme Court has identified the following four factors to guide us in our analysis: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1146</span> of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. at 2283. Importantly, no single factor is determinative, <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371, and <i>either</i> severity <i>or</i> pervasiveness can satisfy the element, if sufficient. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1247-48.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Frequency</i></h2>\n<p>For nearly three years, CHRW employees allegedly used \"sex specific\" language in Reeves's presence every day and the offensive radio program was played every morning. The frequency factor thus undoubtedly weighs in Reeves's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Severity</i></h2>\n<p>As for severity, the words and phrases that were used fall variously on the spectrum of language that is particularly offensive to women. Rather than consider the severity of each instance of alleged harassment, however, we must determine the severity of all the circumstances taken together. It is arguably severe for the sole woman in a workplace to be exposed to: (1) the words \"cunt\" and \"whore;\" (2) vulgar references to sexual acts such as \"a woman's teeth on a man's dick\" and \"fuck your sister;\" and (3) conversations concerning ejaculation, men's erotic dreams, female sexual anatomy, sources and indications of female sexual arousal, and female pornography. Because the alleged conduct was never directed at Reeves, however, we cannot say that the nature of the overall harassment here was as objectively severe as the conduct that we and our sister circuits have previously deemed actionable under the severity factor. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1246-52. Accordingly, we conclude that, while it is not determinative,<sup>[5]</sup> the severity factor weighs against Reeves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. Physically Threatening or Humiliating</i></h2>\n<p>Nothing occurred in the office that was physically threatening.<sup>[6]</sup> Nevertheless, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1147</span> jury could find that the language and radio programming created an objectively humiliating work environment, particularly because Reeves was the only woman in the workstation pod. Given the conduct described in our discussion of the severity factor, it is objectively reasonable that a woman in Reeves's position would have felt humiliated in such circumstances. Reeves's exposure to the pornographic image on her co-worker's computer also contributed to the objectively humiliating environment.</p>\n<p>The humiliating atmosphere is further revealed in the warning that Reeves received from a co-worker who used offensive language concerning another offensive co-worker's last day of work. The earplugs comment suggests that those who used derogatory language in the office knew that their conduct made Reeves uncomfortable, and perhaps even intended to do so. It is certainly reasonable that such treatment would be humiliating for a woman in Reeves's position. Accordingly, this factor weighs in Reeves's favor, despite the lack of physically threatening conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>4. Unreasonable Interference with Job Performance</i></h2>\n<p>Finally, we believe that a jury could properly conclude that the conduct unreasonably interfered with Reeves's job performance. CHRW argues that this factor should weigh in its favor because Reeves received positive performance reviews and was given significant responsibilities. As the Supreme Court declared in <i>Harris,</i> however, the conduct in question need not have tangibly affected the plaintiff's job performance in order to be actionable. <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 371. Reeves testified that the conduct made it difficult to concentrate on work and caused her to leave the pod and stand in the hallway. She claims that she started to shake when she saw the pornographic image on her co-worker's computer. She also often took time away from her work to complain to her superiors, ask her co-workers to stop, or write notes to herself so she would have a record of some of the more offensive incidents. This factor, therefore, also weighs in Reeves's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>5. Our \"Severe or Pervasive\" Determination</i></h2>\n<p>After considering the Supreme Court's four factors in light of the totality of the circumstances in which Reeves worked at CHRW, we hold that a reasonable jury could find that the harassment Reeves faced was sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment. We agree with the Sixth Circuit that \"a work environment viewed as a whole may satisfy the legal definition of an abusive work environment, for purposes of a hostile environment claim, even though no single episode crosses the Title VII threshold.\" <i>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 187 F.3d 553, 564 (6th Cir.1999). Reeves has presented evidence of sufficient pervasiveness to survive summary judgment, even if none of the incidents she has described, standing alone, would be actionable. Accordingly, this case can only be appropriately resolved after a jury weighs the factors and decides whether the harassment was such that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the conduct at issue here is not what typically comes to mind when one thinks of sexual harassment under Title VII. We were careful in <i>Mendoza,</i> moreover, not to \"establish a baseline of actionable conduct that is far below that established by other circuits,\" <i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1251, or \"trivialize true instances of sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1252 n. 10. Furthermore, summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1148</span> is meant to \"police [that] baseline for hostile environment claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1244. Nevertheless, what Reeves experienced at CHRW was not the \"ordinary socializing,\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998), or \"ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing\" that the \"severe or pervasive\" element is meant to filter out. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. at 2284.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, <i>either</i> severity <i>or</i> pervasiveness can form the basis of a hostile work environment claim, and our holding today focuses on the latter. While it would be impossible to find a prior case that perfectly supports our reasoning, two of our sister circuits have held that similar facts satisfied the \"severe or pervasive\" element on pervasiveness specifically.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lauderdale v. Texas Dep't of Criminal Justice,</i> 512 F.3d 157, 158 (5th Cir. 2007), the Fifth Circuit recently held that evidence of frequent but non-severe harassment was sufficiently pervasive to survive summary judgment. The relevant harassment in <i>Lauderdale</i> consisted of multiple nightly phone calls from the plaintiff's supervisor for nearly four months.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 158. While the calls clearly indicated the supervisor's romantic interest in the plaintiff, the call that was most sexual in nature merely invited the plaintiff to travel to Las Vegas with the supervisor and \"snuggle.\" <i>Id.</i> In reversing the district court's entry of summary judgment, the Fifth Circuit panel declared that frequent harassment can be sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment even if the individual incidents of harassment are \"not severe.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Dominguez-Curry v. Nevada Transp. Dep't,</i> 424 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion when it was faced with evidence of pervasiveness. The plaintiff testified that her supervisor told sexually explicit jokes \"like every day,\" <i>id.</i> at 1035 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that she \"could write a book\" about all the times her supervisor had said that he did not think the plaintiff, or a female generally, could do the work that a man is required to do. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit panel held that the evidence of sexually explicit jokes and demeaning comments was \"more than sufficient\" to create \"genuine factual disputes. . . as to <i>both</i> the severity and pervasiveness of [the supervisor's] conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Just as the plaintiffs did in <i>Lauderdale</i> and <i>Dominguez-Curry,</i> Reeves has presented evidence of pervasive conduct that is sufficient to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The evidence that Reeves presented prevents us from holding that, as a matter of law, the conduct in question did not satisfy the \"based on\" or \"severe or pervasive\" elements of a hostile work environment claim. The entry of summary judgment in CHRW's favor is thus reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Honorable Cecilia M.

Shell Oil Co.,</i> 466 U.S. 54, 104 S.Ct. 1621, 80 L.Ed.2d 41 (1984), the former Fifth Circuit considered an optometrist employee's Title VII claim based on the employer's segregation of patients from a minority group of which the employee was a member. <i>Id.</i> The Court declared that the employer's failure to intentionally direct any discriminatory treatment toward the employee was \"not material.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239. <i>See also, </i><i>Busby v. City of Orlando,</i> 931 F.2d 764, 785 (11th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (reiterating the <i>Walker</i> principle).</p>\n<p>[3]  Our sister circuits have also recognized the importance of this principle, for both the \"based on\" and \"severe or pervasive\" elements, and in both the race- and sex-discrimination contexts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jennings v. Univ. of North Carolina,</i> 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir.) (en banc) (\"[S]exually charged comments. . . even if not directed specifically to the plaintiff, are relevant to determining whether the plaintiff was subjected to sex-based harassment.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i>  U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 247, 169 L.Ed.2d 147 (2007); <i>Jackson v.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (\"CHRW\") on her hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. We must determine whether daily exposure to language and radio programming that are particularly offensive to women but not targeted at the plaintiff are sufficient to satisfy the \"based on\" and \"severe or pervasive\" elements of a hostile work environment claim. Because Reeves satisfied the \"based on\" element and a jury could reasonably conclude that the conduct at issue was sufficiently pervasive to support a hostile work environment claim, we reverse the entry of summary judgment in CHRW's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In July 2001, Reeves began working as a Transportation Sales Representative (\"TSR\") in CHRW's Birmingham, Alabama branch office. She was the only female TSR in the office, and she worked in a workstation pod cubicle near other TSRs. Only one other woman worked at the Birmingham branch office, but her desk was not in Reeves's pod.</p>\n<p>Reeves alleges that sexually offensive language permeated the work environment in her pod at CHRW every day. She testified in her deposition that from the summer of 2001 to the spring of 2004, she \"could point at every day of the year that some of this behavior went on. It went on every day.\" [Doc. 12-3: 7]. She asserts, moreover, that sexually explicit radio programming playing on a daily basis and her one-time exposure to a pornographic image of a woman on a co-worker's computer also support her claim. Reeves testified that the offensive language and radio programming continued even after she complained to co-workers and her supervisor on several occasions.</p>\n<p>One of Reeves's co-workers frequently used sexually crude language that offended her. This employee \"was consistent, [a]cross the board, day in and day out, in the sexually offensive language, phrases, jokes, songs, comments, remarks.\" [Doc. 12-2: 41]. He often used the phrase \"fucking bitch\" or \"fucking whore\" after hanging up the phone, [<i>id.</i> at 42, 50]; he once called the only other female employee in the office a \"bitch\" after she had left the room, and he once remarked that she had \"a big ass.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 44]. Sexual jokes by this co-worker were also commonplace, including one for which the punch-line was \"fuck your sister and your mother is a whore.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 49-50]. Finally, he once said, \"she's a cunt,\" referring to a female. [Doc. 12-3: 10]. Reeves communicated to this co-worker on multiple occasions that the language made it difficult for her to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1142</span> work, but the employee did not change his behavior.</p>\n<p>Another co-worker also offended Reeves when he used sexually crude language. Reeves overheard this employee talk about (1) \"getting off\" in reference to masturbation, [<i>id.</i> at 1], (2) a song that referenced \"women's teeth on a man's dick,\" [<i>id.</i>], and (3) an experience in a hotel with naked women, [<i>id.</i> at 1-2]. On the day before this co-worker's last day at the office, moreover, Reeves was told that she should bring earplugs to work the next day because the co-worker had said that he could behave however he wanted on his last day. [<i>Id.</i> at 1]. Reeves testified that the co-worker's last day \"was just like any other day: full of sexually offensive remarks, comments, stories, conversation, languagejust like any other day . . . .\" [<i>Id.</i>].</p>\n<p>The branch manager, who was Reeves's direct supervisor, also made comments that offended Reeves. He once referred to a former female co-worker as a \"lazy, good-for-nothing bitch,\" [Doc. 12-2: 52], and another time asked Reeves to \"talk to that stupid bitch on line four,\" referring to a female customer. [Doc. 12-3: 5]. He once said, referring to the only female employee other than Reeves, \"[s]he may be a bitch, but she can read,\" [Doc. 12-2: 167], and on another occasion said \"[s]he's got a big one,\" [<i>id.</i>], referring to her buttocks. Reeves often complained to the branch manager about both his use of offensive language and the use of such language in the office generally.</p>\n<p>Reeves was also offended by a radio program that was played every morning on the stereo in the office. Discussions of the following material on the show offended her: (1) breast size of female celebrities and Playboy Playmates; (2) sexual arousal and women's nipples as indications thereof; (3) masturbation, both in general and with animals; (4) erotic dreams; (5) ejaculation; and (6) female pornography. [<i>Id.</i> at 14-18]. Advertisements for or including the following material that were aired during the program also offended her: (1) sexual favors; (2) a bikini contest that instructed women to wear their most perverse bikinis; (3) a statement that a woman was found in bed with three elves and a candy cane; and (4) a drug called Proton that promised to increase sexual performance, please a partner, and make the user a \"sexual tyrannosaurus rex.\" [<i>Id.</i> at 19-21]. When Reeves complained about the radio programming, she was often told that she could play her own music or change the station. She testified, however, that if she did so the other employees would soon change the radio back to the offensive program.</p>\n<p>The branch manager testified in his deposition that he had used, and heard others use, the term \"bitch\" in the office. He could not recall hearing anyone in the office use \"whore\" in a sexual context. He denied hearing any employee use the word \"cunt\" but estimated that the word \"dick\" was used about once a week. He also testified that he had one or two talks with one of Reeves's co-workers about language, and mentioned language to others during performance evaluations after Reeves complained.</p>\n<p>Reeves resigned from CHRW on March 24, 2004. In February 2006, she filed a complaint against CHRW alleging in part that the use of sexually offensive language created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. The district court entered summary judgment for CHRW on the ground that the alleged harassment was not \"based on\" Reeves's sex.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Reeves asserts that, contrary to the district court's reasoning, whether the allegedly harassing language was directed at the plaintiff is not determinative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1143</span> of whether the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment. CHRW argues that we should affirm the district court because men and women were subjected to the same behavior in the office. Alternatively, CHRW argues that this Court should affirm on the ground that the harassment was not severe or pervasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Chambless v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77609\"><a href=\"/opinion/77609/beverly-chambless-v-louisiana-pacific-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></a></span>, 1349 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The party opposing summary judgment must make \"enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.\" <i>Walker v. Darby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546977\"><a href=\"/opinion/546977/jessie-walker-v-thomas-e-darby-hugh-l-robinson-jr-and-kenneth-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1573</span></a></span>, 1577 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2000e-2(a)(1). The ground for a Title VII sexual harassment claim can be either a tangible employment action or, as Reeves asserts here, the \"creation of a hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of work.\" <i>Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77618\"><a href=\"/opinion/77618/susan-baldwin-v-blue-crossblue-shield-of-al/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>, 1300 (11th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span> (2007). An employee cannot recover under the hostile work environment theory unless she shows that (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her membership in a protected group; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5) a basis for holding the employer liable exists. <i>Mendoza v.

The only elements at issue here are the \"based on\" and \"severe or pervasive\" elements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. \"Based on\"</i></h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has declared that in hostile work environment cases, \"`[t]he critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.'\" <i>Oncale v.

We noted in <i>Baldwin</i> that \"sex specific\" profanity, including words such as \"bitch,\" \"tramp,\" and \"slut,\" is \"more degrading to women than to men\" and thus \"may be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1144</span> considered, for whatever weight [it has] on the sexual harassment scales.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1302.<sup>[1]</sup> Though we have never explicitly held that such \"sex specific\" language satisfies the \"based on\" element in a sexual harassment hostile work environment case even when the language does not target the plaintiff, we do so today in light of our race-discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>It is well established that racially offensive language need not be targeted at the plaintiff in order to support a Title VII hostile work environment claim. For example, in <i>Walker v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406826\"><a href=\"/opinion/406826/29-fair-emplpraccas-1259-30-empl-prac-dec-p-33028-clyde-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1982), the plaintiff, a black male, who had just begun working as a trainee at a car dealership, claimed that other employees repeatedly used offensive racial epithets, including references to poorly repaired cars as \"nigger-rigged\" and to the salesman with the lowest sales volume as \"the black ass.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1358. We concluded that the fact that many of the epithets were not directed at Walker was not determinative because the offensive language was often used in Walker's presence after he had voiced objections. <i>Id.</i> at 1359 n. 2.<sup>[2]</sup> The harassment that Walker experienced was \"based on\" his race because the \"race specific\" language that was used was particularly offensive to him as a black male, regardless of whom the language targeted.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Our <i>Walker</i> reasoning can correctly be extended here. The language in the CHRW office included the \"sex specific\" words \"bitch,\" \"whore,\" and \"cunt\" that, under <i>Baldwin,</i> may be more degrading to women than men. The subject matter of the conversations and jokes that allegedly permeated the office on a daily basis included male and female sexual anatomy, masturbation, and female pornography, all of which was discussed in a manner that was similarly more degrading to women than men. The radio programming that Reeves claims was also similar. Therefore, even if such language was used indiscriminately in the office such that men and women were equally exposed to the language, the language had a discriminatory effect on Reeves because of its degrading nature. Accordingly, just as the language in <i>Walker</i> was sufficient to support Walker's hostile work environment claim because it particularly offended Walker as a black man, we hold that the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1145</span> Reeves presented was sufficient to survive summary judgment on the \"based on\" element here.</p>\n<p>CHRW argues that we should not look to race cases here because, \"race is different\" than sex. In the Title VII context, however, CHRW's argument is simply misplaced. We have made it abundantly clear that</p>\n<blockquote>[s]exual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality. Surely, a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Henson v. City of Dundee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406158\"><a href=\"/opinion/406158/29-fair-emplpraccas-787-29-empl-prac-dec-p-32993-barbara-j-henson/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 902 (11th Cir.1982). The Supreme Court, moreover, drew upon race discrimination cases when it held that Title VII covered hostile work environment claims and has \"followed the lead of such cases in attempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute.\" <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 787, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (1998). Additionally, the Supreme Court has noted that it is proper for us as we decide sexual harassment cases to draw \"on standards developed in cases involving racial harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 787 n. 2, 118 S.Ct. at 2283 n. 2. Accordingly, we see no reason to analyze the \"based on\" element differently here than we would in a race discrimination case.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that Reeves satisfied the \"based on\" element, we turn to the \"severe or pervasive\" element.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. \"Severe or Pervasive\"</i></h2>\n<p>CHRW argues that even if the harassment was \"based on\" Reeves's sex, summary judgment was appropriate because, as a matter of law, the harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of Reeves's employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The \"severe or pervasive\" element \"tests the mettle of most sexual harassment claims.\" <i>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74559\"><a href=\"/opinion/74559/gupta-v-florida-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 583 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, when properly applied, this element will \"filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. at 2284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The element is only satisfied, moreover, \"[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370.</p>\n<p>The \"severe or pervasive\" element \"includes a subjective and an objective component.\" <i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1246. We have no doubt that Reeves subjectively perceived the harassment to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to violate Title VII. The question before us is whether that perception was objectively unreasonable as a matter of law such that the district court appropriately entered summary judgment in CHRW's favor.</p>\n<p>We must judge the objective severity of the harassment from the perspective of a reasonable person in Reeves's position, considering the totality of the circumstances rather than acts in isolation. <i>Id.</i> As we have recognized, this inquiry is somewhat fact-intensive, <i>id.,</i> but the Supreme Court has identified the following four factors to guide us in our analysis: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1146</span> of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. at 2283. Importantly, no single factor is determinative, <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371, and <i>either</i> severity <i>or</i> pervasiveness can satisfy the element, if sufficient. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1247-48.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Frequency</i></h2>\n<p>For nearly three years, CHRW employees allegedly used \"sex specific\" language in Reeves's presence every day and the offensive radio program was played every morning. The frequency factor thus undoubtedly weighs in Reeves's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Severity</i></h2>\n<p>As for severity, the words and phrases that were used fall variously on the spectrum of language that is particularly offensive to women. Rather than consider the severity of each instance of alleged harassment, however, we must determine the severity of all the circumstances taken together. It is arguably severe for the sole woman in a workplace to be exposed to: (1) the words \"cunt\" and \"whore;\" (2) vulgar references to sexual acts such as \"a woman's teeth on a man's dick\" and \"fuck your sister;\" and (3) conversations concerning ejaculation, men's erotic dreams, female sexual anatomy, sources and indications of female sexual arousal, and female pornography. Because the alleged conduct was never directed at Reeves, however, we cannot say that the nature of the overall harassment here was as objectively severe as the conduct that we and our sister circuits have previously deemed actionable under the severity factor. <i>See </i><i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1246-52. Accordingly, we conclude that, while it is not determinative,<sup>[5]</sup> the severity factor weighs against Reeves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. Physically Threatening or Humiliating</i></h2>\n<p>Nothing occurred in the office that was physically threatening.<sup>[6]</sup> Nevertheless, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1147</span> jury could find that the language and radio programming created an objectively humiliating work environment, particularly because Reeves was the only woman in the workstation pod. Given the conduct described in our discussion of the severity factor, it is objectively reasonable that a woman in Reeves's position would have felt humiliated in such circumstances. Reeves's exposure to the pornographic image on her co-worker's computer also contributed to the objectively humiliating environment.</p>\n<p>The humiliating atmosphere is further revealed in the warning that Reeves received from a co-worker who used offensive language concerning another offensive co-worker's last day of work. The earplugs comment suggests that those who used derogatory language in the office knew that their conduct made Reeves uncomfortable, and perhaps even intended to do so. It is certainly reasonable that such treatment would be humiliating for a woman in Reeves's position. Accordingly, this factor weighs in Reeves's favor, despite the lack of physically threatening conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>4. Unreasonable Interference with Job Performance</i></h2>\n<p>Finally, we believe that a jury could properly conclude that the conduct unreasonably interfered with Reeves's job performance. CHRW argues that this factor should weigh in its favor because Reeves received positive performance reviews and was given significant responsibilities. As the Supreme Court declared in <i>Harris,</i> however, the conduct in question need not have tangibly affected the plaintiff's job performance in order to be actionable. <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 371. Reeves testified that the conduct made it difficult to concentrate on work and caused her to leave the pod and stand in the hallway. She claims that she started to shake when she saw the pornographic image on her co-worker's computer. She also often took time away from her work to complain to her superiors, ask her co-workers to stop, or write notes to herself so she would have a record of some of the more offensive incidents. This factor, therefore, also weighs in Reeves's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>5. Our \"Severe or Pervasive\" Determination</i></h2>\n<p>After considering the Supreme Court's four factors in light of the totality of the circumstances in which Reeves worked at CHRW, we hold that a reasonable jury could find that the harassment Reeves faced was sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment. We agree with the Sixth Circuit that \"a work environment viewed as a whole may satisfy the legal definition of an abusive work environment, for purposes of a hostile environment claim, even though no single episode crosses the Title VII threshold.\" <i>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></span>, 564 (6th Cir.1999). Reeves has presented evidence of sufficient pervasiveness to survive summary judgment, even if none of the incidents she has described, standing alone, would be actionable. Accordingly, this case can only be appropriately resolved after a jury weighs the factors and decides whether the harassment was such that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the conduct at issue here is not what typically comes to mind when one thinks of sexual harassment under Title VII. We were careful in <i>Mendoza,</i> moreover, not to \"establish a baseline of actionable conduct that is far below that established by other circuits,\" <i>Mendoza,</i> 195 F.3d at 1251, or \"trivialize true instances of sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1252 n. 10. Furthermore, summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1148</span> is meant to \"police [that] baseline for hostile environment claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1244. Nevertheless, what Reeves experienced at CHRW was not the \"ordinary socializing,\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While it would be impossible to find a prior case that perfectly supports our reasoning, two of our sister circuits have held that similar facts satisfied the \"severe or pervasive\" element on pervasiveness specifically.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lauderdale v. Texas Dep't of Criminal Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"55864\"><a href=\"/opinion/55864/lauderdale-v-texas-dept-of-criminal-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 158 (5th Cir. 2007), the Fifth Circuit recently held that evidence of frequent but non-severe harassment was sufficiently pervasive to survive summary judgment. The relevant harassment in <i>Lauderdale</i> consisted of multiple nightly phone calls from the plaintiff's supervisor for nearly four months.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 158. While the calls clearly indicated the supervisor's romantic interest in the plaintiff, the call that was most sexual in nature merely invited the plaintiff to travel to Las Vegas with the supervisor and \"snuggle.\" <i>Id.</i> In reversing the district court's entry of summary judgment, the Fifth Circuit panel declared that frequent harassment can be sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment even if the individual incidents of harassment are \"not severe.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Dominguez-Curry v. Nevada Transp. Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792060\"><a href=\"/opinion/792060/sylvia-dominguez-curry-v-nevada-transportation-department-roc-stacey/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion when it was faced with evidence of pervasiveness. The plaintiff testified that her supervisor told sexually explicit jokes \"like every day,\" <i>id.</i> at 1035 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that she \"could write a book\" about all the times her supervisor had said that he did not think the plaintiff, or a female generally, could do the work that a man is required to do. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit panel held that the evidence of sexually explicit jokes and demeaning comments was \"more than sufficient\" to create \"genuine factual disputes. . . as to <i>both</i> the severity and pervasiveness of [the supervisor's] conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Just as the plaintiffs did in <i>Lauderdale</i> and <i>Dominguez-Curry,</i> Reeves has presented evidence of pervasive conduct that is sufficient to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The evidence that Reeves presented prevents us from holding that, as a matter of law, the conduct in question did not satisfy the \"based on\" or \"severe or pervasive\" elements of a hostile work environment claim.
