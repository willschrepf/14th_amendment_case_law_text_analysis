S 1997e(a), provides\nthat a prisoner confined in any jail, prison or correctional\nfacility may not bring any action under any federal law --\nwith respect to prison conditions -- \"until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"\nThe issue in this case is whether the PLRA’s exhaustion\nrequirement applies to a grievance procedure described in\nan inmate handbook but not formally adopted by a state\nadministrative agency. We hold that it does. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the judgment of the District Court and we\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiffs Victor Concepcion and Anthony Ways are\ninmates in the custody of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections (NJDOC). They filed this S 1983 action against\nvarious corrections officers and officials on August 6, 1998,\nalleging that the defendants violated their civil rights\nthrough the use of excessive force during two separate\nincidents on August 18, 1997. We briefly describe each of\nthese alleged incidents in turn.\n\nA. Concepcion Incident\n\fDuring the morning of August 18, 1997, Corrections\nOfficer William Sellnow opened all of the cells in\nConcepcion’s tier at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) so\nthat the inmates could proceed to morning breakfast. After\nopening the cells, Sellnow walked down the hallway and\ncrossed paths with Concepcion. Because the hall was\nnarrow, Concepcion claims that he had to turn to the side\nso that Sellnow could pass. According to Concepcion, for no\napparent reason, Sellnow rammed his shoulder into\nConcepcion’s left shoulder as he walked by, and\n\n                                3\n\n\nConcepcion responded by asking, \"What’s your problem?\"\nApp. at A112-13. Concepcion claims that the two men then\nstarted swinging at each other simultaneously.\n\nAccording to Concepcion, he and Sellnow exchanged\npunches for only a \"couple [of] seconds.\" Id. at A114.\nConcepcion admits that he hit Sellnow, who later received\nat least four stitches in the forehead. Upon witnessing the\nfray from a nearby desk, Sargeant Larry Cole called a \"Code\n33,\" which, according to Concepcion, \"means there’s a\nfight.\" Id. at A115. At this point, Concepcion claims that\napproximately thirty to forty officers began running towards\nhim. In response, Concepcion ran in the opposite direction\nand jumped over the tier railing down to the first floor.\n\nSeveral officers caught and restrained Concepcion on the\nfirst floor. Corrections Officer George Phillips testified that\nit took four or five officers to place Concepcion in\nhandcuffs. While restraining Concepcion, Phillips suffered a\nburn from a nearby boiler pipe. After he was restrained,\nConcepcion claims that Cole kicked him in the face and\nthat Phillips stuck his nightstick in between Concepcion’s\nhandcuffs, lifting him off his feet and into the air.\nConcepcion further claims that Phillips rammed his head\ninto a cement wall, and that after Concepcion was taken to\na detention cell, Phillips hit him in the forehead with a\nnightstick.\n\nAs a result of the events described above, Concepcion\nwas charged with committing a prohibited act (\"assaulting\nany person\") in violation of Title 10A of the New Jersey\nAdministrative Code, which subjects inmates to disciplinary\naction and sanctions for committing certain enumerated\nacts. See N.J. ADMIN. CODE tit. 10A, S 4-4.1(a)*.002 (2002).\nAfter a disciplinary hearing, the hearing officer found\nConcepcion guilty as charged and sanctioned him to 15\ndays detention, a 360-day loss of commutation time, and\n365 days administrative segregation.\n\nB. Ways Incident\n\nOn August 18, 1997, the same day in which the above\nevents took place, inmate Anthony Ways was involved in a\nseparate incident. After having his lunch at the prison\n\n                                4\n\fcafeteria, Ways proceeded towards a central rotunda, upon\nwhich various wings of the prison converge. He alleges that,\nas he approached the rotunda, there was a \"commotion\ngoing on,\" with \"people . . . running\" and\"officers swinging\nsticks.\" App. at A135. He also testified that he saw two\nofficers on the ground in the center of the rotunda.\n\nAfter observing this commotion, Ways claims that he\nattempted to get back to his wing so that he could return\nto his cell. Id. at A137. According to Ways, while attempting\nto return, he was approached by Corrections Officer Robert\nRichter. Ways testified as follows:\n\n       [H]e’s approaching me, so, out of instinct, my hands go\n       up. He swings. As he swings, I’m trying to prevent his\n       swing by pushing his shoulder away from me. . . . As\n       he swings, he hits me in my jaw, and it didn’t knock\n       me out, but it was enough for me. I laid on the ground\n       and surrender[ed].\n\nId. at A139. According to Ways, after he laid down on the\nground, Richter and another officer placed his arms and\nlegs in handcuffs. Ways claims that, after he was\nrestrained, several officers stood him up and carried him\ntowards another wing of the prison. As he was being\ncarried, Ways alleges that he was dropped to the floor and\nthat Richter kicked him. He testified that he sustained\nvarious injuries requiring medical treatment.\n\nIn connection with the events of that day, Ways was\ncharged with assaulting Richter and two other corrections\nofficers in violation of Title 10A of the New Jersey\nAdministrative Code. See N.J. ADMIN. CODE tit. 10A, S 4-\n4.1(a)*.002 (2002). After a disciplinary hearing, a hearing\nofficer found Ways guilty on all charges and sanctioned him\nto 30 days detention, a 970-day loss of commutation time,\n970 days administrative segregation, and a 30-day loss of\nrecreation privileges. On February 19, 1999, also in\nconnection with what transpired on August 18, 1997, Ways\npled guilty to criminal aggravated assault in violation of\nN.J. STAT. ANN. S 2C:12-1(b)(5). The aggravated assault\ncharge was based on the fact that Ways had punched\nCorrections Officer Kimberly Bleinstein in the face, breaking\nher jaw.\n\n                                  5\n\n\nC. Plaintiffs’ S 1983 Complaint\n\nOn August 6, 1998, Concepcion and Ways filed their\ncomplaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983, alleging that they\nwere the victims of excessive force in violation of their\nconstitutional rights on August 18, 1997. They named\nseven NJSP corrections officers and officials as defendants.\n\nOn August 22, 2000, the defendants moved for summary\njudgment, arguing, inter alia, that the plaintiffs had failed\n\fto exhaust available administrative remedies pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a), which mandates that\"[n]o action\nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\nsection 1983 . . . by a prisoner . . . until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"\nMore specifically, the defendants argued that, before\nseeking redress in a federal court, the plaintiffs were\nrequired under S 1997e(a) to follow the administrative\ngrievance procedure set forth in the Department of\nCorrections Inmate Handbook (\"Handbook\"). The District\nCourt described that procedure as follows:\n\n       The process begins by the inmate submitting an\n       \"Administrative Remedy Form\" to the Administrator’s\n       Office. Upon receipt, the Department Head writes a\n       response on the form; this response is signed by the\n       Primary Level Supervisor and the Department Head;\n       and the response is finally reviewed and signed by the\n       Intermediate Level Supervisor as the Administrator’s\n       designee. The inmate complaint form with the\n       administrative response is then placed in the inmate’s\n       Classification folder and the prisoner is given a copy.\n       No administrative appeal is permitted.\n\nConcepcion v. Morton, 125 F. Supp. 2d 111, 116 (D.N.J.\n2000) (citations omitted). The Handbook states that the\ngrievance procedure is \"set up to give the inmate population\na way to bring complaints, problems, suggestions, etc. to\nthe attention of the Administration of New Jersey State\nPrison to solve or possibly put into use.\" App. at A5.\n\nFinding that the grievance procedure described in the\nHandbook does not constitute an \"administrative remedy\"\nfor purposes of S 1997e(a), the District Court held that\nthere were no available administrative remedies for the\n\n                                6\n\n\nplaintiffs to exhaust and therefore denied defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the complaint for failure to address\navailable administrative remedies on December 21, 2000.1\nConcepcion, 125 F. Supp. 2d at 121. After conducting an\nanalysis of the language, structure, and legislative history\nof S 1997e(a), the court concluded that, in using the phrase\n\"administrative remedies,\" Congress meant\"administrative\nschemes promulgated by an agency.\" Id. at 120. Because\nthe prison warden and his staff, rather than the\nDepartment of Corrections, promulgated the grievance\nprocedure in the Handbook, the District Court held that the\nremedy was not \"administrative\" in nature and thus outside\nthe scope of S 1997e(a). See id.\n\nSubsequent to the District Court’s decision denying\nsummary judgment, the United States Supreme Court\ndecided Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001), in which\nthe Court held that S 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of an\nadministrative remedy even if that remedy cannot grant the\ntype of relief sought by an inmate. See id. at 734. Thus, the\nprisoner in that case, who sought only money damages\n\funder S 1983, was required to complete a prison\nadministrative process, even though that process could not\nprovide him with any monetary relief. See id. On June 11,\n2001, in light of the Court’s holding in Booth , the\ndefendants moved for reconsideration of the District Court’s\ndecision. The District Court, however, denied defendants’\nmotion for reconsideration, explaining:\n\n       The clear implication of Booth is that courts should not\n       read futility exceptions into [S 1997e(a)’s] exhaustion\n       requirement where there is an existing administrative\n       procedure. Here, this Court found that there was no\n       existing administrative procedure; therefore; the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The District Court did, however, grant summary judgment on Count\nSeven of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which alleged that \"defendants\nWillis Morton and John Smith 1-13 failed to provide adequate training\nand supervision to their corrections officers in violation of plaintiffs’\nFifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" Concepcion, 125 F.\nSupp. 2d at 127. The court held that these claims for supervisory\nliability had to be dismissed because there was no\"affirmative link\"\nbetween the alleged constitutional violations and the officials sued. Id. at\n128.\n\n                                7\n\n\n       teaching of Booth does not alter the Court’s original\n       Opinion and Order.\n\nApp. at A28.\n\nThe defendants subsequently moved for reconsideration\nof the District Court’s order denying their previous motion\nfor reconsideration, noting that several District Judges in\nthe District of New Jersey had recently issued decisions at\nodds with the District Court’s holding in Concepcion. See,\ne.g. In re Bayside Prison Litigation, 190 F. Supp. 2d 755,\n771 (D.N.J. 2002) (\"I cannot accept Concepcion’s conclusion\nthat an inmate handbook can never constitute an\nadministrative remedy . . . .\"). In the alternative, the\ndefendants sought a stay of the proceedings and moved to\ncertify the question of what constitutes an \"administrative\nremedy\" under S 1997e(a). On October 5, 2001, the District\nCourt denied defendants’ second motion for reconsideration\nbut granted their motion for certification and for a stay of\nthe proceedings.\n\nThe defendants then petitioned this Court, pursuant to\nRule 5 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, for\npermission to appeal the question whether the exhaustion\nrequirement of S 1997e(a) is applicable only in those\ninstances in which an administrative remedy scheme is\nadopted through regulations rather than through\npublication and distribution of an inmate handbook. We\ngranted the petition on November 8, 2001.\n\nII.\n\fThe District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\nSS 1331 and 1343. We have jurisdiction over this\ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b). Because we\nhave been asked to consider the scope of S 1997e(a)’s\napplicability, which is a question of law, our review is\nplenary. See Scully v. US WATS, Inc., 238 F.3d 497, 507 (3d\nCir. 2001); Jenkins v. Morton, 148 F.3d 257, 259 (3d Cir.\n1998).\n\nIII.\n\nThis appeal requires us to consider whether the term\n\"administrative remedies\" in 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a)\n\n                                8\n\n\nencompasses remedies not promulgated by an\nadministrative agency, such as the relatively informal\ngrievance procedure at issue in this case, a procedure\nwhich was established by the prison administrators of the\nNJSP and published in the Department of Corrections\nInmate Handbook.\n\nTo assert an action under 42 U.S.C. S 1983, plaintiffs\nordinarily need not exhaust administrative remedies first.\nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, ___, 122 S.Ct. 983, 987\n(2002) (citing Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla. , 457 U.S.\n496, 516 (1982)). However, in 1980, Congress enacted the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 94\nStat. 352, as amended 42 U.S.C. S 1997e (1994 ed.), which\nchanged the rules for prisoner suits. CRIPA gave district\ncourts discretion to stay a prisoner’s S 1983 action \"for a\nperiod not to exceed 180 days,\" during which time the\nprisoner would exhaust available \"plain, speedy, and\neffective administrative remedies.\" S 1997e(a)(1). The\nSupreme Court described this provision as a \"limited\nexhaustion requirement,\" McCarthy v. Madigan , 503 U.S.\n140, 150 (1992), as it \"could be ordered only if the State’s\nprison grievance system met specified federal standards,\nand even then, only if, in the particular case, the court\nbelieved the requirement ‘appropriate and in the interests of\njustice,’ \" Porter, 534 U.S at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 987-88 (citing\nSS 1997e(a) and (b)).\n\nFifteen years after CRIPA became law, Congress\nstrengthened its exhaustion requirement by enacting the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat.\n1321-73, as amended, 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a) (1994 ed.,\nSupp. V), which made exhaustion mandatory. The revised\nprovision states that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title,\nor any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\nprison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" 42\nU.S.C. S 1997e(a) (emphasis added). At issue in this case is\nwhether the Handbook’s grievance procedure constitutes an\navailable \"administrative remedy\" within the scope of the\nrevised S 1997e(a).\n\f                                9\n\n\nIn construing the intended meaning of a statute, we\nbegin with an examination of its language. See Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 172 (2001). Because Congress did\nnot define the term \"administrative remedy\" inS 1997e(a),\nwe give those words their ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\nSeed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995) (citing\nFDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 (1994)). In applying this\ninterpretative principle, the District Court noted that\nBlack’s Law Dictionary defines \"administrative remedy\" to\nbe \" ‘a nonjudicial remedy provided by an administrative\nagency.’ \" Concepcion, 125 F. Supp. 2d at 118 (quoting\nBLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1296 (7th ed. 1999)). Based largely\nupon this isolated definition in Black’s Law Dictionary, as\nwell as a reference in S 1997e(b) to \"[t]he failure of a State\nto adopt or adhere to an administrative grievance\nprocedure,\" the District Court found that the statute’s\nlanguage indicates that \"Congress intended ‘administrative\nremedy’ to refer to an administrative scheme adopted by the\nstate department of corrections.\" Concepcion , 125 F. Supp.\n2d at 118-19.\n\nWhile we recognize that the District Court properly\nattempted to ascertain the meaning of S 1997e(a) through\nexamination of the statute’s own language, we have doubts\nas to whether that language sufficiently supports the leap\nthe court took in interpreting the general term used by\nCongress--administrative remedies--as including only the\nrelatively narrow category of remedies ultimately carved out\nby the District Court, i.e., those that have been\"adopted by\nthe state department of corrections.\" Nowhere inS 1997e\ndoes Congress indicate that the manner in which a remedy\nis implemented affects the applicability of the statute’s\nexhaustion requirement.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the isolated definition of\n\"administrative remedy\" cited by the District Court hardly\nlends conclusive support to its narrow interpretation, which\nrests mostly on the fact that Congress used the term\n\"administrative remedies\" rather than just the term\n\"remedies.\" The degree to which the word \"administrative\"\nshould be read to narrow the range of \"remedies\"\ncontemplated in S 1997e(a), however, appears less certain\nin light of broader definitions not discussed by the District\n\n                                10\n\n\nCourt. For example, another reference defines\n\"administrative\" as \"proceeding from . . . an\nadministration,\" which, in turn, is defined as\"a body of\npersons who are responsible for managing a business or an\ninstitution.\" WEBSTER’STHIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 28\n(1993). In this case, the remedy in the Handbook\n\"proceeded from\" the prison warden and his staff, who, as\na group responsible for managing the prison, comfortably\nfit within the above-quoted definition of \"administration.\"\n\fJust as the Supreme Court found that the single word\n\"remedy\" in S 1997e(a) can have different meanings\n\"depending on where one looks,\" Booth, 532 U.S. at 738, we\nfind that the ordinary meaning of the term \"administrative\nremedy\" is far less clear and instructive than has been\nsuggested by the District Court. Accordingly, we look to the\nstatutory history and motivating policies of S 1997e(a) for\nfurther guidance in determining whether the Handbook’s\ngrievance procedure constitutes an \"administrative remedy\"\nfor purposes of the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement.\n\nPlaintiffs liken the grievance procedure described in the\nHandbook to a \"suggestion box,\" contending that such a\nremedy is not of the type contemplated by Congress in\nS 1997e(a). However, as we noted in Nyhuis v. Reno, 204\nF.3d 65 (3d Cir. 2000), \" ‘[t]he removal of the qualifiers\n\"plain, speedy, and effective\" from the PLRA’s mandatory\nexhaustion requirement indicates that Congress no longer\nwanted courts to examine the effectiveness of\nadministrative remedies but rather to focus solely on\nwhether an administrative remedy program is \"available\" in\nthe prison involved.’ \" Id. at 72 (quoting Alexander v. Hawk,\n159 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 1998)). We further\nexplained that it was a \"justifiable assumption\" that\n\"Congress intended to save courts from spending countless\nhours, educating themselves in every case, as to the\nvagaries of prison administrative processes, state or\nfederal.\" Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 74. Along these lines, we\nthink it also justified to assume from the PLRA\namendments that Congress did not intend for courts to\nexpend scarce judicial resources examining how and by\nwhom a prison’s grievance procedure was implemented.\nRather, as noted above, the revisions to S 1997e(a) suggest\n\n                                11\n\n\nthat Congress wanted the focus to be on the availability of\nan administrative remedy program. See id. at 72; see also\nPorter, 534 U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 988 (explaining that,\nunder S 1997e(a)’s revised exhaustion provision, \"[a]ll\n‘available’ remedies must now be exhausted; those remedies\nneed not meet federal standards, nor must they be‘plain,\nspeedy, and effective’ \"). In this case, while the effectiveness\nof the Handbook’s grievance procedure may be unclear,\nthere is no doubt that it is \"available\" to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe District Court’s narrow interpretation of the term\n\"administrative remedies\" also seems inconsistent with\nseveral other motivating policies and goals of the PLRA. In\nPorter, a case in which the Supreme Court concluded that\nthe PLRA’s exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate\nsuits about prison life, including those involving allegations\nof excessive force, the Court found that, \"[b]eyond doubt,\nCongress enacted S 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and\nimprove the quality of prisoner suits.\" Id. at 988; see also\nAlexander, 159 F.3d at 1326 n.11 (stating that\"Congress\namended section 1997e(a) largely in response to concerns\nabout the heavy volume of frivolous prison litigation in the\nfederal courts\") (citing 141 Cong. Rec. H14078-02, *H14105\n\f(daily ed. Dec. 6, 1995)).\n\nIn Booth, the Court noted some of the practical\narguments for exhaustion, even when the administrative\nremedy cannot provide the type of relief sought by an\ninmate:\n\n       [R]equiring exhaustion in these circumstances would\n       produce administrative results that would satisfy at\n       least some inmates who start out asking for nothing\n       but money, since the very fact of being heard and\n       prompting administrative change can mollify passions\n       even when nothing ends up in the pocket. And one\n       may suppose that the administrative process itself\n       would filter out some frivolous claims and foster better-\n       prepared litigation once a dispute did move to the\n       courtroom, even absent formal factfinding.\n\n532 U.S. at 737. The fact that the grievance procedure at\nissue in this case was not formally adopted by the\nDepartment of Corrections seems irrelevant to these\n\n                                12\n\n\nrationales for exhaustion. Not only does the process\noutlined in the Handbook give inmates the opportunity to\ninform the prison administration about any complaints, but\nit also provides for a written response back to the inmates.\nFurthermore, the responses of the Department Head are\nsubject to review by the Administrator’s Office and must be\nsigned both by the Department Head and by the Primary\nLevel Supervisor before the Intermediate Level Supervisor\ngives a final formal answer. (App. at A5.) In light of the\nforum and feedback provided by the Handbook’s remedy,\neven if the vast majority of prisoners still remain\nunsatisfied, \"at least some\" may be able to resolve their\nconcerns without resorting to litigation. For cases\nultimately brought to court, the remedy form submitted by\nthe inmate and the written response provided by the prison\nadministration could facilitate adjudication by clarifying the\ncontours of the controversy. See Porter, 122 S.Ct. at 988;\nsee also Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 74 (noting that an\nadministrative remedy program \" ‘often helps focus and\nclarify the issues for the court’ \") (quoting Alexander, 159\nF.3d at 1326 n.11).\n\nAnother policy consideration in favor of the exhaustion\nrequirements relates to the overall efficacy, as well as the\nimprovement, of the administrative process. See Nyhuis,\n204 at 76 (stating that \"a comprehensive exhaustion\nrequirement better serves the policy of granting an agency\nthe ‘opportunity to correct its own mistakes with respect to\nthe programs it administers before it is haled into federal\ncourt’ \") (quoting McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145). Furthermore,\nif an \"inmate sees his meritorious claims handled with care\nby his jailers, he is more likely to respect their rules and\nserve his time in a manner that is as productive as\npossible.\" Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 76-77. We find these goals to\nbe consistent with requiring the plaintiffs in this case to\n\fcomply with the remedy described in the Handbook before\nallowing them to pursue their S 1983 claims in federal\ncourt. If the administrators of the NJSP at least have the\nopportunity to consider and address the grievances of\nConcepcion and Ways, the possibility exists that the prison\nand its administration may benefit or improve. With these\npolicies in mind, the fact that the Handbook’s remedy has\n\n                                13\n\n\nnot been formally adopted by the NJDOC is without\nsignificance.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, we hold that a remedy need\nnot be formally adopted through regulations by an agency\nin order for it to be considered an \"administrative remedy\"\nwithin the scope of S 1997e(a)’s exhaustion requirement.\nThus, in this case, the plaintiffs must first attempt to\naddress their grievances through the administrative remedy\ndescribed in New Jersey’s Department of Corrections\nInmate Handbook before they will be allowed to pursue\ntheir S 1983 claims. Accordingly, we will reverse the\ndecision of the District Court and direct it to dismiss the\nplaintiffs’ complaint for failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies pursuant to S 1997e(a).\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                14\n\f",

S 1997e(a), provides\nthat a prisoner confined in any jail, prison or correctional\nfacility may not bring any action under any federal law --\nwith respect to prison conditions -- \"until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"\nThe issue in this case is whether the PLRA’s exhaustion\nrequirement applies to a grievance procedure described in\nan inmate handbook but not formally adopted by a state\nadministrative agency. We hold that it does. Accordingly,\nwe reverse the judgment of the District Court and we\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiffs Victor Concepcion and Anthony Ways are\ninmates in the custody of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections (NJDOC). They filed this S 1983 action against\nvarious corrections officers and officials on August 6, 1998,\nalleging that the defendants violated their civil rights\nthrough the use of excessive force during two separate\nincidents on August 18, 1997. We briefly describe each of\nthese alleged incidents in turn.\n\nA. Concepcion Incident\n\fDuring the morning of August 18, 1997, Corrections\nOfficer William Sellnow opened all of the cells in\nConcepcion’s tier at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) so\nthat the inmates could proceed to morning breakfast. After\nopening the cells, Sellnow walked down the hallway and\ncrossed paths with Concepcion. Because the hall was\nnarrow, Concepcion claims that he had to turn to the side\nso that Sellnow could pass. According to Concepcion, for no\napparent reason, Sellnow rammed his shoulder into\nConcepcion’s left shoulder as he walked by, and\n\n                                3\n\n\nConcepcion responded by asking, \"What’s your problem?\"\nApp. at A112-13. Concepcion claims that the two men then\nstarted swinging at each other simultaneously.\n\nAccording to Concepcion, he and Sellnow exchanged\npunches for only a \"couple [of] seconds.\" Id. at A114.\nConcepcion admits that he hit Sellnow, who later received\nat least four stitches in the forehead. Upon witnessing the\nfray from a nearby desk, Sargeant Larry Cole called a \"Code\n33,\" which, according to Concepcion, \"means there’s a\nfight.\" Id. at A115. At this point, Concepcion claims that\napproximately thirty to forty officers began running towards\nhim. In response, Concepcion ran in the opposite direction\nand jumped over the tier railing down to the first floor.\n\nSeveral officers caught and restrained Concepcion on the\nfirst floor. Corrections Officer George Phillips testified that\nit took four or five officers to place Concepcion in\nhandcuffs. While restraining Concepcion, Phillips suffered a\nburn from a nearby boiler pipe. After he was restrained,\nConcepcion claims that Cole kicked him in the face and\nthat Phillips stuck his nightstick in between Concepcion’s\nhandcuffs, lifting him off his feet and into the air.\nConcepcion further claims that Phillips rammed his head\ninto a cement wall, and that after Concepcion was taken to\na detention cell, Phillips hit him in the forehead with a\nnightstick.\n\nAs a result of the events described above, Concepcion\nwas charged with committing a prohibited act (\"assaulting\nany person\") in violation of Title 10A of the New Jersey\nAdministrative Code, which subjects inmates to disciplinary\naction and sanctions for committing certain enumerated\nacts. See N.J. ADMIN. CODE tit. 10A, S 4-4.1(a)*.002 (2002).\nAfter a disciplinary hearing, the hearing officer found\nConcepcion guilty as charged and sanctioned him to 15\ndays detention, a 360-day loss of commutation time, and\n365 days administrative segregation.\n\nB. Ways Incident\n\nOn August 18, 1997, the same day in which the above\nevents took place, inmate Anthony Ways was involved in a\nseparate incident. After having his lunch at the prison\n\n                                4\n\fcafeteria, Ways proceeded towards a central rotunda, upon\nwhich various wings of the prison converge. He alleges that,\nas he approached the rotunda, there was a \"commotion\ngoing on,\" with \"people . . . running\" and\"officers swinging\nsticks.\" App. at A135. He also testified that he saw two\nofficers on the ground in the center of the rotunda.\n\nAfter observing this commotion, Ways claims that he\nattempted to get back to his wing so that he could return\nto his cell. Id. at A137. According to Ways, while attempting\nto return, he was approached by Corrections Officer Robert\nRichter. Ways testified as follows:\n\n       [H]e’s approaching me, so, out of instinct, my hands go\n       up. He swings. As he swings, I’m trying to prevent his\n       swing by pushing his shoulder away from me. . . . As\n       he swings, he hits me in my jaw, and it didn’t knock\n       me out, but it was enough for me. I laid on the ground\n       and surrender[ed].\n\nId. at A139. According to Ways, after he laid down on the\nground, Richter and another officer placed his arms and\nlegs in handcuffs. Ways claims that, after he was\nrestrained, several officers stood him up and carried him\ntowards another wing of the prison. As he was being\ncarried, Ways alleges that he was dropped to the floor and\nthat Richter kicked him. He testified that he sustained\nvarious injuries requiring medical treatment.\n\nIn connection with the events of that day, Ways was\ncharged with assaulting Richter and two other corrections\nofficers in violation of Title 10A of the New Jersey\nAdministrative Code. See N.J. ADMIN. CODE tit. 10A, S 4-\n4.1(a)*.002 (2002). After a disciplinary hearing, a hearing\nofficer found Ways guilty on all charges and sanctioned him\nto 30 days detention, a 970-day loss of commutation time,\n970 days administrative segregation, and a 30-day loss of\nrecreation privileges. On February 19, 1999, also in\nconnection with what transpired on August 18, 1997, Ways\npled guilty to criminal aggravated assault in violation of\nN.J. STAT. ANN. S 2C:12-1(b)(5). The aggravated assault\ncharge was based on the fact that Ways had punched\nCorrections Officer Kimberly Bleinstein in the face, breaking\nher jaw.\n\n                                  5\n\n\nC. Plaintiffs’ S 1983 Complaint\n\nOn August 6, 1998, Concepcion and Ways filed their\ncomplaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983, alleging that they\nwere the victims of excessive force in violation of their\nconstitutional rights on August 18, 1997. They named\nseven NJSP corrections officers and officials as defendants.\n\nOn August 22, 2000, the defendants moved for summary\njudgment, arguing, inter alia, that the plaintiffs had failed\n\fto exhaust available administrative remedies pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a), which mandates that\"[n]o action\nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\nsection 1983 . . . by a prisoner . . . until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"\nMore specifically, the defendants argued that, before\nseeking redress in a federal court, the plaintiffs were\nrequired under S 1997e(a) to follow the administrative\ngrievance procedure set forth in the Department of\nCorrections Inmate Handbook (\"Handbook\"). The District\nCourt described that procedure as follows:\n\n       The process begins by the inmate submitting an\n       \"Administrative Remedy Form\" to the Administrator’s\n       Office. Upon receipt, the Department Head writes a\n       response on the form; this response is signed by the\n       Primary Level Supervisor and the Department Head;\n       and the response is finally reviewed and signed by the\n       Intermediate Level Supervisor as the Administrator’s\n       designee. The inmate complaint form with the\n       administrative response is then placed in the inmate’s\n       Classification folder and the prisoner is given a copy.\n       No administrative appeal is permitted.\n\nConcepcion v.

After conducting an\nanalysis of the language, structure, and legislative history\nof S 1997e(a), the court concluded that, in using the phrase\n\"administrative remedies,\" Congress meant\"administrative\nschemes promulgated by an agency.\" Id. at 120. Because\nthe prison warden and his staff, rather than the\nDepartment of Corrections, promulgated the grievance\nprocedure in the Handbook, the District Court held that the\nremedy was not \"administrative\" in nature and thus outside\nthe scope of S 1997e(a). See id.\n\nSubsequent to the District Court’s decision denying\nsummary judgment, the United States Supreme Court\ndecided Booth v. Churner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118434\"><a href=\"/opinion/118434/booth-v-churner/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), in which\nthe Court held that S 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of an\nadministrative remedy even if that remedy cannot grant the\ntype of relief sought by an inmate. See id. at 734. Thus, the\nprisoner in that case, who sought only money damages\n\funder S 1983, was required to complete a prison\nadministrative process, even though that process could not\nprovide him with any monetary relief. See id. On June 11,\n2001, in light of the Court’s holding in Booth , the\ndefendants moved for reconsideration of the District Court’s\ndecision. The District Court, however, denied defendants’\nmotion for reconsideration, explaining:\n\n       The clear implication of Booth is that courts should not\n       read futility exceptions into [S 1997e(a)’s] exhaustion\n       requirement where there is an existing administrative\n       procedure. Here, this Court found that there was no\n       existing administrative procedure; therefore; the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The District Court did, however, grant summary judgment on Count\nSeven of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which alleged that \"defendants\nWillis Morton and John Smith 1-13 failed to provide adequate training\nand supervision to their corrections officers in violation of plaintiffs’\nFifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" Concepcion, 125 F.\nSupp. 2d at 127. The court held that these claims for supervisory\nliability had to be dismissed because there was no\"affirmative link\"\nbetween the alleged constitutional violations and the officials sued. Id. at\n128.\n\n                                7\n\n\n       teaching of Booth does not alter the Court’s original\n       Opinion and Order.\n\nApp. at A28.\n\nThe defendants subsequently moved for reconsideration\nof the District Court’s order denying their previous motion\nfor reconsideration, noting that several District Judges in\nthe District of New Jersey had recently issued decisions at\nodds with the District Court’s holding in Concepcion.

In the alternative, the\ndefendants sought a stay of the proceedings and moved to\ncertify the question of what constitutes an \"administrative\nremedy\" under S 1997e(a). On October 5, 2001, the District\nCourt denied defendants’ second motion for reconsideration\nbut granted their motion for certification and for a stay of\nthe proceedings.\n\nThe defendants then petitioned this Court, pursuant to\nRule 5 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, for\npermission to appeal the question whether the exhaustion\nrequirement of S 1997e(a) is applicable only in those\ninstances in which an administrative remedy scheme is\nadopted through regulations rather than through\npublication and distribution of an inmate handbook. We\ngranted the petition on November 8, 2001.\n\nII.\n\fThe District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\nSS 1331 and 1343. We have jurisdiction over this\ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b). Because we\nhave been asked to consider the scope of S 1997e(a)’s\napplicability, which is a question of law, our review is\nplenary. See Scully v.

However, in 1980, Congress enacted the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 94\nStat. 352, as amended 42 U.S.C. S 1997e (1994 ed.), which\nchanged the rules for prisoner suits. CRIPA gave district\ncourts discretion to stay a prisoner’s S 1983 action \"for a\nperiod not to exceed 180 days,\" during which time the\nprisoner would exhaust available \"plain, speedy, and\neffective administrative remedies.\" S 1997e(a)(1). The\nSupreme Court described this provision as a \"limited\nexhaustion requirement,\" McCarthy v. Madigan , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112701\"><a href=\"/opinion/112701/mccarthy-v-madigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (1992), as it \"could be ordered only if the State’s\nprison grievance system met specified federal standards,\nand even then, only if, in the particular case, the court\nbelieved the requirement ‘appropriate and in the interests of\njustice,’ \" Porter, 534 U.S at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 987-88 (citing\nSS 1997e(a) and (b)).\n\nFifteen years after CRIPA became law, Congress\nstrengthened its exhaustion requirement by enacting the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat.\n1321-73, as amended, 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a) (1994 ed.,\nSupp. V), which made exhaustion mandatory. The revised\nprovision states that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title,\nor any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\nprison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" 42\nU.S.C. S 1997e(a) (emphasis added). At issue in this case is\nwhether the Handbook’s grievance procedure constitutes an\navailable \"administrative remedy\" within the scope of the\nrevised S 1997e(a).\n\f                                9\n\n\nIn construing the intended meaning of a statute, we\nbegin with an examination of its language. See Duncan v.\nWalker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (2001). Because Congress did\nnot define the term \"administrative remedy\" inS 1997e(a),\nwe give those words their ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\nSeed Co. v. Winterboer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117888\"><a href=\"/opinion/117888/asgrow-seed-co-v-winterboer/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (1995) (citing\nFDIC v. Meyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 (1994)). In applying this\ninterpretative principle, the District Court noted that\nBlack’s Law Dictionary defines \"administrative remedy\" to\nbe \" ‘a nonjudicial remedy provided by an administrative\nagency.’ \" Concepcion, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 118 (quoting\nBLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1296 (7th ed. 1999)). Based largely\nupon this isolated definition in Black’s Law Dictionary, as\nwell as a reference in S 1997e(b) to \"[t]he failure of a State\nto adopt or adhere to an administrative grievance\nprocedure,\" the District Court found that the statute’s\nlanguage indicates that \"Congress intended ‘administrative\nremedy’ to refer to an administrative scheme adopted by the\nstate department of corrections.\" Concepcion , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 118-19.\n\nWhile we recognize that the District Court properly\nattempted to ascertain the meaning of S 1997e(a) through\nexamination of the statute’s own language, we have doubts\nas to whether that language sufficiently supports the leap\nthe court took in interpreting the general term used by\nCongress--administrative remedies--as including only the\nrelatively narrow category of remedies ultimately carved out\nby the District Court, i.e., those that have been\"adopted by\nthe state department of corrections.\" Nowhere inS 1997e\ndoes Congress indicate that the manner in which a remedy\nis implemented affects the applicability of the statute’s\nexhaustion requirement.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the isolated definition of\n\"administrative remedy\" cited by the District Court hardly\nlends conclusive support to its narrow interpretation, which\nrests mostly on the fact that Congress used the term\n\"administrative remedies\" rather than just the term\n\"remedies.\" The degree to which the word \"administrative\"\nshould be read to narrow the range of \"remedies\"\ncontemplated in S 1997e(a), however, appears less certain\nin light of broader definitions not discussed by the District\n\n                                10\n\n\nCourt. For example, another reference defines\n\"administrative\" as \"proceeding from . . . an\nadministration,\" which, in turn, is defined as\"a body of\npersons who are responsible for managing a business or an\ninstitution.\" WEBSTER’STHIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 28\n(1993). In this case, the remedy in the Handbook\n\"proceeded from\" the prison warden and his staff, who, as\na group responsible for managing the prison, comfortably\nfit within the above-quoted definition of \"administration.\"\n\fJust as the Supreme Court found that the single word\n\"remedy\" in S 1997e(a) can have different meanings\n\"depending on where one looks,\" Booth, 532 U.S. at 738, we\nfind that the ordinary meaning of the term \"administrative\nremedy\" is far less clear and instructive than has been\nsuggested by the District Court. Accordingly, we look to the\nstatutory history and motivating policies of S 1997e(a) for\nfurther guidance in determining whether the Handbook’s\ngrievance procedure constitutes an \"administrative remedy\"\nfor purposes of the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement.\n\nPlaintiffs liken the grievance procedure described in the\nHandbook to a \"suggestion box,\" contending that such a\nremedy is not of the type contemplated by Congress in\nS 1997e(a). However, as we noted in Nyhuis v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767702\"><a href=\"/opinion/767702/douglas-nyhuis-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-eric-holder-deputy-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000), \" ‘[t]he removal of the qualifiers\n\"plain, speedy, and effective\" from the PLRA’s mandatory\nexhaustion requirement indicates that Congress no longer\nwanted courts to examine the effectiveness of\nadministrative remedies but rather to focus solely on\nwhether an administrative remedy program is \"available\" in\nthe prison involved.’ \" Id. at 72 (quoting Alexander v. Hawk,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73325\"><a href=\"/opinion/73325/alexander-v-hawk/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (11th Cir. 1998)). We further\nexplained that it was a \"justifiable assumption\" that\n\"Congress intended to save courts from spending countless\nhours, educating themselves in every case, as to the\nvagaries of prison administrative processes, state or\nfederal.\" Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 74. Along these lines, we\nthink it also justified to assume from the PLRA\namendments that Congress did not intend for courts to\nexpend scarce judicial resources examining how and by\nwhom a prison’s grievance procedure was implemented.\nRather, as noted above, the revisions to S 1997e(a) suggest\n\n                                11\n\n\nthat Congress wanted the focus to be on the availability of\nan administrative remedy program. See id. at 72; see also\nPorter, 534 U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 988 (explaining that,\nunder S 1997e(a)’s revised exhaustion provision, \"[a]ll\n‘available’ remedies must now be exhausted; those remedies\nneed not meet federal standards, nor must they be‘plain,\nspeedy, and effective’ \"). In this case, while the effectiveness\nof the Handbook’s grievance procedure may be unclear,\nthere is no doubt that it is \"available\" to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe District Court’s narrow interpretation of the term\n\"administrative remedies\" also seems inconsistent with\nseveral other motivating policies and goals of the PLRA. In\nPorter, a case in which the Supreme Court concluded that\nthe PLRA’s exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate\nsuits about prison life, including those involving allegations\nof excessive force, the Court found that, \"[b]eyond doubt,\nCongress enacted S 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and\nimprove the quality of prisoner suits.\" Id. at 988; see also\nAlexander, 159 F.3d at 1326 n.11 (stating that\"Congress\namended section 1997e(a) largely in response to concerns\nabout the heavy volume of frivolous prison litigation in the\nfederal courts\") (citing 141 Cong. Rec. H14078-02, *H14105\n\f(daily ed. Dec. 6, 1995)).\n\nIn Booth, the Court noted some of the practical\narguments for exhaustion, even when the administrative\nremedy cannot provide the type of relief sought by an\ninmate:\n\n       [R]equiring exhaustion in these circumstances would\n       produce administrative results that would satisfy at\n       least some inmates who start out asking for nothing\n       but money, since the very fact of being heard and\n       prompting administrative change can mollify passions\n       even when nothing ends up in the pocket. And one\n       may suppose that the administrative process itself\n       would filter out some frivolous claims and foster better-\n       prepared litigation once a dispute did move to the\n       courtroom, even absent formal factfinding.\n\n532 U.S. at 737. The fact that the grievance procedure at\nissue in this case was not formally adopted by the\nDepartment of Corrections seems irrelevant to these\n\n                                12\n\n\nrationales for exhaustion. Not only does the process\noutlined in the Handbook give inmates the opportunity to\ninform the prison administration about any complaints, but\nit also provides for a written response back to the inmates.\nFurthermore, the responses of the Department Head are\nsubject to review by the Administrator’s Office and must be\nsigned both by the Department Head and by the Primary\nLevel Supervisor before the Intermediate Level Supervisor\ngives a final formal answer. (App. at A5.) In light of the\nforum and feedback provided by the Handbook’s remedy,\neven if the vast majority of prisoners still remain\nunsatisfied, \"at least some\" may be able to resolve their\nconcerns without resorting to litigation. For cases\nultimately brought to court, the remedy form submitted by\nthe inmate and the written response provided by the prison\nadministration could facilitate adjudication by clarifying the\ncontours of the controversy. See Porter, 122 S.Ct. at 988;\nsee also Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 74 (noting that an\nadministrative remedy program \" ‘often helps focus and\nclarify the issues for the court’ \") (quoting Alexander, 159\nF.3d at 1326 n.11).\n\nAnother policy consideration in favor of the exhaustion\nrequirements relates to the overall efficacy, as well as the\nimprovement, of the administrative process. See Nyhuis,\n204 at 76 (stating that \"a comprehensive exhaustion\nrequirement better serves the policy of granting an agency\nthe ‘opportunity to correct its own mistakes with respect to\nthe programs it administers before it is haled into federal\ncourt’ \") (quoting McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145). Furthermore,\nif an \"inmate sees his meritorious claims handled with care\nby his jailers, he is more likely to respect their rules and\nserve his time in a manner that is as productive as\npossible.\" Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 76-77. We find these goals to\nbe consistent with requiring the plaintiffs in this case to\n\fcomply with the remedy described in the Handbook before\nallowing them to pursue their S 1983 claims in federal\ncourt. If the administrators of the NJSP at least have the\nopportunity to consider and address the grievances of\nConcepcion and Ways, the possibility exists that the prison\nand its administration may benefit or improve. With these\npolicies in mind, the fact that the Handbook’s remedy has\n\n                                13\n\n\nnot been formally adopted by the NJDOC is without\nsignificance.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, we hold that a remedy need\nnot be formally adopted through regulations by an agency\nin order for it to be considered an \"administrative remedy\"\nwithin the scope of S 1997e(a)’s exhaustion requirement.\nThus, in this case, the plaintiffs must first attempt to\naddress their grievances through the administrative remedy\ndescribed in New Jersey’s Department of Corrections\nInmate Handbook before they will be allowed to pursue\ntheir S 1983 claims. Accordingly, we will reverse the\ndecision of the District Court and direct it to dismiss the\nplaintiffs’ complaint for failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies pursuant to S 1997e(a).\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                14\n\f</pre>",
