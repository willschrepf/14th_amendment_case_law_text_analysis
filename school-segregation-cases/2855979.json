It is undisputed that when\nHiggason left for segregation he possessed considerable personal property in his\ncell. That day, instead of inventorying Higgason’s property and storing it in the\nproperty room as dictated by prison policy, guards opened Higgason’s cell and\nallowed other inmates to steal most of his belongings. The guards then disposed of\nHiggason’s remaining property. When Higgason returned to his cell approximately\nthree weeks later, all of his personal property was missing.\n\n       In September 1993, Higgason filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that\n12 different guards were responsible for the loss of his property. He claimed that\ntheir actions deprived him of property without due process of law and, because the\nmissing items included legal documents essential to his appeal of Higgason v.\nRosko, No. S91-563M (N.D. Ill. Apr. 8, 1993), aff’d sub. nom. Higgason v. Adank,\nNo. 93-2000 (7th Cir. Feb. 3, 1994) (summary disposition), impeded his First\nAmendment right of access to the courts. The district court dismissed Higgason’s\ncomplaint in 1995. The court reasoned that he failed to state a due process claim\nbecause the Indiana Tort Claims Act afforded an adequate postdeprivation remedy.\nSee Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984); Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527,\n543-44 (1981). The court also reasoned that the loss of Higgason’s legal materials\ncould not have denied him access to the courts since his appeal of Higgason v. Rosko\nhad been dismissed as frivolous in the interim, and thus no injury resulted. We\naffirmed the dismissal of Higgason’s complaint. See Higgason v. Barnes, 95 F.3d\n1154 (7th Cir. 1996) (unpublished order).\n\n       Higgason then sued the guards in the small claims court of LaPorte County,\nIndiana. The state court set the case for trial in December 1997, but when\nHiggason requested to be transported to court, the defendants objected, arguing\nthat under Hill v. Duckworth, 679 N.E.2d 938 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997), the state court\nhad no jurisdiction to order Higgason’s transport. In Hill, the Indiana appellate\ncourt affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of an inmate’s case in small claims court\nbecause the inmate failed to appear for trial on two separate occasions. Id. at 940.\nThe Hill court relied on a 1948 state supreme court decision holding that Indiana\ncourts cannot order an inmate’s attendance for a matter unrelated to the underlying\nconviction, see Rogers v. Youngblood, 78 N.E.2d 663, 665 (Ind. 1948), and reasoned\nthat “there were other avenues available to [the inmate] by which he could\n\n\n      1\n        Higgason’s plethora of pro se litigation in the federal courts led us to restrain\nhim from filing further lawsuits subject to limited exceptions. Higgason v. Shroyer,\nNo. 98-1973 (7th Cir. Feb. 12, 1999) (unpublished order); see Support Sys. Int’l, Inc.\nv. Mack, 45 F.3d 185 (7th Cir. 1995) (per curiam). These appeals arise from a suit\nfiled before we entered our injunction, and thus have been allowed to proceed.\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                        Page 3\n\nprosecute his action without having to represent himself at a trial in the\ncourthouse.” Hill, 679 N.E.2d at 940 n.1. The judge in Higgason’s case thus\nconcluded that he could not order Higgason’s transport, but when Higgason\nrequested adjudication by telephone, video, or submission of documentary evidence,\nthe court denied his request. (All of this is according to Higgason’s account because\nthe record before us includes sparse documentation from the state court.) What\nhappened next in the state court is unclear because the docket sheet provided by\nHiggason includes no entry reflecting a final judgment. The parties agree, however,\nthat the small claims court ultimately dismissed Higgason’s suit without prejudice\nand denied Higgason’s praecipe for a transcript.\n\n        Higgason then returned to federal court and in February 1998 filed a second\ncivil rights action arising from the events of April 1993 and mirroring his earlier\nfederal suit. He named and served seven of the guards originally sued in\n1993—Captains Howard Morton and Robert Wittenberg, Sergeant Paul Autterson,\nand Officers Andrew Paull, Brian Thompson, Gabrial Tinoco, and Mike Lunn—and\nadded a new defendant, Property Officer David Rimmer. Higgason again alleged\nthat, when the guards allowed inmates to steal his property and then disposed of\nthe remainder themselves, they deprived him of property without due process of\nlaw. He also claimed that the defendants denied him access to the courts because\nthe missing property included documents necessary to prosecute his appeal of\nHiggason v. Rosko and to prepare for trial in Higgason v. Scott, No. 46D04-9309-SC-\n1519 (LaPorte Super. Ct. 1994). Higgason also included a tort claim under Indiana\nlaw. The defendants again moved to dismiss, citing claim preclusion and the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, see District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460\nU.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923), but the district\ncourt denied their motion. As is relevant here, the court concluded that Higgason\nnow stated a due process claim arising from his stolen property because his\ncomplaint rebutted the presumption that an adequate postdeprivation remedy\nexisted. The court noted that Higgason alleged he was prevented from prosecuting\nhis tort claim in the small claims court and that the state court “denied his\npraecipe” when he “tried to appeal.” The district court suggested that, in light of\nHill v. Duckworth, “it is far more difficult than it once was to hold that Indiana’s\ntort claims act provides any sort of adequate postdeprivation remedy for prisoners.”\nEven if Higgason were to refile his claim in state court, the court surmised, “prison\nofficials might force the case’s dismissal simply by transferring Mr. Higgason to a\npenal facility in another county before the trial of the proposed civil action.”\n\n       Four of the defendants—Autterson, Thompson, Tinoco, and Lunn—failed to\nanswer the complaint and were defaulted. Then in March 2001, now almost eight\nyears after the underlying incident, the district court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of Morton, Wittenberg, Rimmer, and Paull. As to Higgason’s due process\nclaim, the court concluded that Higgason lacked evidence of personal involvement\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                        Page 4\n\nby Wittenberg and Rimmer. The court reached the same conclusion as to Morton\neven while acknowledging that Higgason had submitted some admissible evidence\nthat it was Morton who ordered his placement in segregation and directed that his\ncell be opened after he was removed. Finally, the court held that Higgason lacked\nevidence that Paull’s minimal involvement was anything more than negligent.\n\n       As to Higgason’s claim that he was denied access to the courts, the district\ncourt, as it had done in the previous federal case, held that Higgason could not show\nan injury resulting from the loss of his legal documents. This time, however, the\ncourt concluded that Higgason was not prevented from appealing the dismissal of\nHiggason v. Rosko simply because his copy of a memorandum filed in the district\ncourt had been stolen. The memorandum was part of the appellate record, the court\nreasoned, so its absence from Higgason’s personal records did not preclude him from\npursuing his appeal. Likewise, the district court held that Higgason could not prove\nthat the loss of documents relating to Higgason v. Scott adversely affected the\noutcome of that case because Higgason abandoned the suit when he lost his temper\nand demanded to be removed from the courtroom.\n\n       The district court then dismissed Higgason’s supplemental state-law claim\nagainst Morton, Wittenberg, Rimmer, and Paull because they were not named in\nhis notice of tort claim. See Ind. Code § 34-4-16.5-9 (1974). Finally, in a separate\norder, the court entered a default judgment for $27,405 against the guards who did\nnot answer Higgason’s complaint.\n\n       Higgason filed a timely notice of appeal, which we docketed as case\nno. 02-4273. We suspended proceedings in that appeal, however, because after the\nentry of judgment Sergeant Autterson moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b) to set aside the default judgment. Autterson succeeded in getting the\njudgment against him reduced to $15,429, but the district court refused to set it\naside altogether. We reversed that ruling and directed that the case proceed on the\nmerits, Higgason v. Autterson, 49 Fed. Appx. 73 (7th Cir. 2002) (unpublished order),\nand in September 2004 the district court granted summary judgment for Autterson.\nThe court acknowledged that Higgason had produced evidence that Autterson\nrelayed to another guard the directive from Morton to open Higgason’s cell to other\ninmates and that Higgason’s evidence supported an inference that Autterson’s\nconduct was “malicious, willful and wanton, and possibly criminal.” Nevertheless,\nthe court concluded that Autterson was shielded from liability by qualified\nimmunity. The court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nHiggason’s state-law claim, with the explanation that Higgason could refile in state\ncourt. Higgason filed another appeal, which we docketed as case no. 04-3773.\n\n      We start with Higgason’s due process claim. We will not analyze the\nevidence defendant-by-defendant because we conclude, as we did when we affirmed\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                          Page 5\n\nthe dismissal of Higgason’s 1993 lawsuit, that he simply fails to state a federal\nconstitutional claim for the deprivation of his property. See Cardoso v. Robert\nBosch Corp., 427 F.3d 429, 432 (7th Cir. 2005) (recognizing that summary judgment\nmay be affirmed on any ground apparent from the record); Russ v. Watts, 414 F.3d\n783, 787 n.2 (7th Cir. 2005) (same). The unauthorized intentional deprivation of an\nindividuals’ property by a state employee does not deny the procedural due process\nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment so long as “a meaningful postdeprivation\nremedy for the loss is available.” Hudson, 468 U.S. at 533; see Gable v. City of\nChicago, 296 F.3d 531, 539-40 (7th Cir. 2002). We have held that the Indiana Tort\nClaims Act provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy to redress claims like\nHiggason’s. See Wynn v. Southward, 251 F.3d 588, 593 (7th Cir. 2001); Hossman v.\nSpradlin, 812 F.2d 1019, 1023 (7th Cir. 1987). In this case, the district court\nreasoned that Indiana’s tort remedy was inadequate for Higgason because of Hill v.\nDuckworth and its application by the LaPorte County judge to dismiss Higgason’s\nsmall-claims action for want of prosecution. This is incorrect both factually and\nlegally. Higgason alleged in his 1998 federal complaint that his praecipe was\ndenied by the small claims court, but the reason is nowhere found in the record.\nCertainly there is no evidence that Higgason’s failure to appeal the dismissal to the\nstate appellate court was attributable to the judge presiding over his suit or to court\npersonnel rather than to Higgason’s own inaction or procedural failings. Indiana\nlaw is settled that civil litigants have a guaranteed right to an appeal, see Ind. High\nSch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc. v. Martin, 765 N.E.2d 1238, 1242 (Ind. 2002), as well as a\nright to a certified transcript at any time, see Lies v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., 286\nN.E.2d 170, 174 (Ind. 1972); Crown Aluminum Indus. v. Wabash Co., 369 N.E.2d\n945, 947 (Ind. App. Ct. 1977). More importantly, the Indiana courts have\nemphasized after Hill that the restriction on transporting prisoners is not a\ncomplete bar to an inmate’s cause of action under the Indiana Tort Claims Act. See\nNiksich v. Cotton, 810 N.E.2d 1003, 1008 (Ind. 2004) (holding that inmate has no\nabsolute right to attend civil trial but “may seek to submit the case through\ndocumentary evidence, to conduct the trial by telephonic conference, to secure\nsomeone else to represent him at trial, or to postpone the trial until his release from\nincarceration”); Murfitt v. Murfitt, 809 N.E.2d 332, 334-35 (Ind. App. Ct. 2004)\n(reversing judgment where inmate was denied alternative means to participate in\ncivil trial); Sabo v. Sabo, 812 N.E.2d 238, 246 (Ind. App. Ct. 2004) (same);\nZimmerman v. Hanks, 766 N.E.2d 752, 757-58 (Ind. App. Ct. 2002) (same). The fact\nthat Higgason’s attempt to litigate his claims in state court was unsuccessful does\nnot establish that Indiana’s remedy is inadequate. See Hamlin v. Vaudenberg, 95\nF.3d 580, 585 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that postdeprivation remedy must be\n“meaningless or nonexistent” to be inadequate); Easter House v. Felder, 910 F.2d\n1387, 1406 (7th Cir. 1990) (explaining that state remedy is not necessarily\ninadequate because it is uncertain or incomplete). The small claims court may have\nwrongfully dismissed Higgason’s suit, but his recourse was to salvage the action\nthrough Indiana’s appellate courts, not to argue in a new federal action that the\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                        Page 6\n\nadverse decision in state court revived a dormant due process claim. The district\ncourt should have dismissed this claim immediately for failure to state a claim.\n\n       The district court’s resolution of Higgason’s remaining claims is sound. To\nprove that he was denied meaningful access to the courts, Higgason needed\nevidence that he was prevented from pursuing a nonfrivolous lawsuit. See Lewis v.\nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 351 (1996); Johnson v. Barczak, 338 F.3d 771, 772 (7th Cir.\n2003). We have twice before recognized that Higgason’s appeal in Higgason v.\nRosko was patently frivolous, see Higgason v. Adank, No. 93-2000 (7th Cir. Feb. 3,\n1994) (summary disposition); Higgason v. Barnes, 95 F.3d 1154 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(unpublished order), and the district court was correct that Higgason cannot\ncontend that he would have prevailed in the Scott matter but for the theft of his\nlegal materials given that he abandoned the courtroom in a fit of frustration. As for\nthe supplemental state claim, we have reviewed Higgason’s arguments and\nconclude that none has merit.\n\n                                                                        AFFIRMED.\n\f",

The state court set the case for trial in December 1997, but when\nHiggason requested to be transported to court, the defendants objected, arguing\nthat under Hill v. Duckworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144865/hill-v-duckworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ind. Ct. App. 1997), the state court\nhad no jurisdiction to order Higgason’s transport. In Hill, the Indiana appellate\ncourt affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of an inmate’s case in small claims court\nbecause the inmate failed to appear for trial on two separate occasions. Id. at 940.\nThe Hill court relied on a 1948 state supreme court decision holding that Indiana\ncourts cannot order an inmate’s attendance for a matter unrelated to the underlying\nconviction, see Rogers v. Youngblood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3423507\"><a href=\"/opinion/3426446/rogers-v-youngblood-judge/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665 (Ind. 1948), and reasoned\nthat “there were other avenues available to [the inmate] by which he could\n\n\n      1\n        Higgason’s plethora of pro se litigation in the federal courts led us to restrain\nhim from filing further lawsuits subject to limited exceptions.

The judge in Higgason’s case thus\nconcluded that he could not order Higgason’s transport, but when Higgason\nrequested adjudication by telephone, video, or submission of documentary evidence,\nthe court denied his request. (All of this is according to Higgason’s account because\nthe record before us includes sparse documentation from the state court.) What\nhappened next in the state court is unclear because the docket sheet provided by\nHiggason includes no entry reflecting a final judgment. The parties agree, however,\nthat the small claims court ultimately dismissed Higgason’s suit without prejudice\nand denied Higgason’s praecipe for a transcript.\n\n        Higgason then returned to federal court and in February 1998 filed a second\ncivil rights action arising from the events of April 1993 and mirroring his earlier\nfederal suit. He named and served seven of the guards originally sued in\n1993—Captains Howard Morton and Robert Wittenberg, Sergeant Paul Autterson,\nand Officers Andrew Paull, Brian Thompson, Gabrial Tinoco, and Mike Lunn—and\nadded a new defendant, Property Officer David Rimmer. Higgason again alleged\nthat, when the guards allowed inmates to steal his property and then disposed of\nthe remainder themselves, they deprived him of property without due process of\nlaw. He also claimed that the defendants denied him access to the courts because\nthe missing property included documents necessary to prosecute his appeal of\nHiggason v. Rosko and to prepare for trial in Higgason v. Scott, No. 46D04-9309-SC-\n1519 (LaPorte Super. Ct. 1994). Higgason also included a tort claim under Indiana\nlaw. The defendants again moved to dismiss, citing claim preclusion and the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, see District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110889\"><a href=\"/opinion/110889/district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1923), but the district\ncourt denied their motion. As is relevant here, the court concluded that Higgason\nnow stated a due process claim arising from his stolen property because his\ncomplaint rebutted the presumption that an adequate postdeprivation remedy\nexisted. The court noted that Higgason alleged he was prevented from prosecuting\nhis tort claim in the small claims court and that the state court “denied his\npraecipe” when he “tried to appeal.” The district court suggested that, in light of\nHill v. Duckworth, “it is far more difficult than it once was to hold that Indiana’s\ntort claims act provides any sort of adequate postdeprivation remedy for prisoners.”\nEven if Higgason were to refile his claim in state court, the court surmised, “prison\nofficials might force the case’s dismissal simply by transferring Mr. Higgason to a\npenal facility in another county before the trial of the proposed civil action.”\n\n       Four of the defendants—Autterson, Thompson, Tinoco, and Lunn—failed to\nanswer the complaint and were defaulted. Then in March 2001, now almost eight\nyears after the underlying incident, the district court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of Morton, Wittenberg, Rimmer, and Paull. As to Higgason’s due process\nclaim, the court concluded that Higgason lacked evidence of personal involvement\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                        Page 4\n\nby Wittenberg and Rimmer. The court reached the same conclusion as to Morton\neven while acknowledging that Higgason had submitted some admissible evidence\nthat it was Morton who ordered his placement in segregation and directed that his\ncell be opened after he was removed. Finally, the court held that Higgason lacked\nevidence that Paull’s minimal involvement was anything more than negligent.\n\n       As to Higgason’s claim that he was denied access to the courts, the district\ncourt, as it had done in the previous federal case, held that Higgason could not show\nan injury resulting from the loss of his legal documents. This time, however, the\ncourt concluded that Higgason was not prevented from appealing the dismissal of\nHiggason v. Rosko simply because his copy of a memorandum filed in the district\ncourt had been stolen. The memorandum was part of the appellate record, the court\nreasoned, so its absence from Higgason’s personal records did not preclude him from\npursuing his appeal. Likewise, the district court held that Higgason could not prove\nthat the loss of documents relating to Higgason v. Scott adversely affected the\noutcome of that case because Higgason abandoned the suit when he lost his temper\nand demanded to be removed from the courtroom.\n\n       The district court then dismissed Higgason’s supplemental state-law claim\nagainst Morton, Wittenberg, Rimmer, and Paull because they were not named in\nhis notice of tort claim. See Ind. Code § 34-4-16.5-9 (1974). Finally, in a separate\norder, the court entered a default judgment for $27,405 against the guards who did\nnot answer Higgason’s complaint.\n\n       Higgason filed a timely notice of appeal, which we docketed as case\nno. 02-4273. We suspended proceedings in that appeal, however, because after the\nentry of judgment Sergeant Autterson moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b) to set aside the default judgment. Autterson succeeded in getting the\njudgment against him reduced to $15,429, but the district court refused to set it\naside altogether. We reversed that ruling and directed that the case proceed on the\nmerits, Higgason v. Autterson, 49 Fed. Appx. 73 (7th Cir. 2002) (unpublished order),\nand in September 2004 the district court granted summary judgment for Autterson.\nThe court acknowledged that Higgason had produced evidence that Autterson\nrelayed to another guard the directive from Morton to open Higgason’s cell to other\ninmates and that Higgason’s evidence supported an inference that Autterson’s\nconduct was “malicious, willful and wanton, and possibly criminal.” Nevertheless,\nthe court concluded that Autterson was shielded from liability by qualified\nimmunity. The court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nHiggason’s state-law claim, with the explanation that Higgason could refile in state\ncourt. Higgason filed another appeal, which we docketed as case no. 04-3773.\n\n      We start with Higgason’s due process claim. We will not analyze the\nevidence defendant-by-defendant because we conclude, as we did when we affirmed\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                          Page 5\n\nthe dismissal of Higgason’s 1993 lawsuit, that he simply fails to state a federal\nconstitutional claim for the deprivation of his property.

In this case, the district court\nreasoned that Indiana’s tort remedy was inadequate for Higgason because of Hill v.\nDuckworth and its application by the LaPorte County judge to dismiss Higgason’s\nsmall-claims action for want of prosecution. This is incorrect both factually and\nlegally. Higgason alleged in his 1998 federal complaint that his praecipe was\ndenied by the small claims court, but the reason is nowhere found in the record.\nCertainly there is no evidence that Higgason’s failure to appeal the dismissal to the\nstate appellate court was attributable to the judge presiding over his suit or to court\npersonnel rather than to Higgason’s own inaction or procedural failings.

The small claims court may have\nwrongfully dismissed Higgason’s suit, but his recourse was to salvage the action\nthrough Indiana’s appellate courts, not to argue in a new federal action that the\n\fNos. 02-4273 & 04-3773                                                        Page 6\n\nadverse decision in state court revived a dormant due process claim. The district\ncourt should have dismissed this claim immediately for failure to state a claim.\n\n       The district court’s resolution of Higgason’s remaining claims is sound. To\nprove that he was denied meaningful access to the courts, Higgason needed\nevidence that he was prevented from pursuing a nonfrivolous lawsuit. See Lewis v.\nCasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (1996); Johnson v.
