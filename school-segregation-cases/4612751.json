BACKGROUND\n        In June 2009, petitioner Ted Smith requested disclosure of 32 categories of\npublic records from the City of San Jose, its redevelopment agency and the\nagency‟s executive director, along with certain other elected officials and their\n\n\n\n\n1     Government Code section 6250 et seq. All statutory references are to the\nGovernment Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                          1\n\fstaffs.2 The targeted documents concerned redevelopment efforts in downtown\nSan Jose and included emails and text messages “sent or received on private\nelectronic devices used by” the mayor, two city council members, and their staffs.\nThe City disclosed communications made using City telephone numbers and email\naccounts but did not disclose communications made using the individuals‟\npersonal accounts.\n       Smith sued for declaratory relief, arguing CPRA‟s definition of “public\nrecords” encompasses all communications about official business, regardless of\nhow they are created, communicated, or stored. The City responded that messages\ncommunicated through personal accounts are not public records because they are\nnot within the public entity‟s custody or control. The trial court granted summary\njudgment for Smith and ordered disclosure, but the Court of Appeal issued a writ\nof mandate. At present, no documents from employees‟ personal accounts have\nbeen collected or disclosed.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n       This case concerns how laws, originally designed to cover paper\ndocuments, apply to evolving methods of electronic communication. It requires\nrecognition that, in today‟s environment, not all employment-related activity\noccurs during a conventional workday, or in an employer-maintained workplace.\n       Enacted in 1968, CPRA declares that “access to information concerning the\nconduct of the people‟s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every\nperson in this state.” (§ 6250.) In 2004, voters made this principle part of our\nConstitution. A provision added by Proposition 59 states: “The people have the\nright of access to information concerning the conduct of the people‟s business,\nand, therefore, . . . the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to\npublic scrutiny.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1).) Public access laws serve a\n\n\n2      These parties, sued as defendants below and the petitioners here, are\ncollectively referred to as the “City.”\n\n\n                                           2\n\fcrucial function. “Openness in government is essential to the functioning of a\ndemocracy. „Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government\nshould be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals\nmust have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the\narbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.‟ ”\n(International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 21,\nAFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 328-329 (International\nFederation).)\n       However, public access to information must sometimes yield to personal\nprivacy interests. When enacting CPRA, the Legislature was mindful of the right\nto privacy (§ 6250), and set out multiple exemptions designed to protect that right.\n(Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court (2007) 42\nCal.4th 278, 288 (Commission on Peace Officer Standards); see § 6254.)\nSimilarly, while the Constitution provides for public access, it does not supersede\nor modify existing privacy rights. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(3).)\n       CPRA and the Constitution strike a careful balance between public access\nand personal privacy. This case concerns how that balance is served when\ndocuments concerning official business are created or stored outside the\nworkplace. The issue is a narrow one: Are writings concerning the conduct of\npublic business beyond CPRA‟s reach merely because they were sent or received\nusing a nongovernmental account? Considering the statute‟s language and the\nimportant policy interests it serves, the answer is no. Employees‟ communications\nabout official agency business may be subject to CPRA regardless of the type of\naccount used in their preparation or transmission.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fA.     Statutory Language, Broadly Construed, Supports Public Access\n       CPRA establishes a basic rule requiring disclosure of public records upon\nrequest. (§ 6253.)3 In general, it creates “a presumptive right of access to any\nrecord created or maintained by a public agency that relates in any way to the\nbusiness of the public agency.” (Sander v. State Bar of California (2013) 58\nCal.4th 300, 323, italics added.) Every such record “must be disclosed unless a\nstatutory exception is shown.” (Ibid.) Section 6254 sets out a variety of\nexemptions, “many of which are designed to protect individual privacy.”\n(International Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 329.) The Act also includes a\ncatchall provision exempting disclosure if “the public interest served by not\ndisclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.”\n(§ 6255, subd. (a).)\n       “When we interpret a statute, „[o]ur fundamental task . . . is to determine\nthe Legislature‟s intent so as to effectuate the law‟s purpose. We first examine the\nstatutory language, giving it a plain and commonsense meaning. We do not\nexamine that language in isolation, but in the context of the statutory framework as\na whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various\nparts of the enactment. If the language is clear, courts must generally follow its\nplain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences\nthe Legislature did not intend. If the statutory language permits more than one\nreasonable interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as the statute‟s\npurpose, legislative history, and public policy.‟ [Citation.] „Furthermore, we\nconsider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory\nscheme of which it is a part, giving significance to every word, phrase, sentence,\nand part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.‟ ” (Sierra Club v.\nSuperior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 157, 165-166.)\n\n3      CPRA was modeled on the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5\nU.S.C. § 552). (San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d\n762, 772.)\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       In CPRA cases, this standard approach to statutory interpretation is\naugmented by a constitutional imperative. (See Sierra Club v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 166.) Proposition 59 amended the Constitution to provide:\n“A statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective\ndate of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people‟s right\nof access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.” (Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2), italics added.) “ „Given the strong public policy of the\npeople‟s right to information concerning the people‟s business (Gov. Code,\n§ 6250), and the constitutional mandate to construe statutes limiting the right of\naccess narrowly (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2)), “all public records are\nsubject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the\ncontrary.” ‟ ” (Sierra Club, at p. 166.)\n       We begin with the term “public record,” which CPRA defines to include\n“any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public‟s\nbusiness prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless\nof physical form or characteristics.” (§ 6252, subd. (e); hereafter “public records”\ndefinition.) Under this definition, a public record has four aspects. It is (1) a\nwriting, (2) with content relating to the conduct of the public‟s business, which is\n(3) prepared by, or (4) owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency.\n       1.     Writing\n       CPRA defines a “writing” as “any handwriting, typewriting, printing,\nphotostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or\nfacsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of\ncommunication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or\nsymbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of\nthe manner in which the record has been stored.” (§ 6252, subd. (g).) It is\nundisputed that the items at issue here constitute writings.\n       In 1968, creating a “writing” could be a fairly involved process. Typically,\na person would use an implement to type, or record words longhand, or would\n\n\n                                           5\n\fdictate to someone else who would write or type a document. Writings were\ngenerally made on paper or some other tangible medium. These writings were\nphysically identifiable and could be retrieved by examining the physical\nrepositories where they were stored. Writings exchanged with people outside the\nagency were generally sent, on paper, through the mail or by courier. In part\nbecause of the time required for their preparation, such writings were fairly formal\nand focused on the business at hand.\n       Today, these tangible, if laborious, writing methods have been enhanced by\nelectronic communication. Email, text messaging, and other electronic platforms,\npermit writings to be prepared, exchanged, and stored more quickly and easily.\nHowever, the ease and immediacy of electronic communication has encouraged a\ncommonplace tendency to share fleeting thoughts and random bits of information,\nwith varying degrees of import, often to broad audiences. As a result, the line\nbetween an official communication and an electronic aside is now sometimes\nblurred. The second aspect of CPRA‟s “public records” definition establishes a\nframework to distinguish between work-related and purely private\ncommunications.\n       2.     Relating to the Conduct of the Public’s Business\n       The overall structure of CPRA, with its many exemptions, makes clear that\nnot everything written by a public employee is subject to review and disclosure.\nTo qualify as a public record, a writing must “contain[] information relating to the\nconduct of the public‟s business.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).) Generally, any “record . . .\nkept by an officer because it is necessary or convenient to the discharge of his\nofficial duty . . . is a public record.” (Braun v. City of Taft (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d\n332, 340; see People v. Purcell (1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 126, 130.)\n       Whether a writing is sufficiently related to public business will not always\nbe clear. For example, depending on the context, an email to a spouse\ncomplaining “my coworker is an idiot” would likely not be a public record.\nConversely, an email to a superior reporting the coworker‟s mismanagement of an\n\n\n                                          6\n\fagency project might well be. Resolution of the question, particularly when\nwritings are kept in personal accounts, will often involve an examination of\nseveral factors, including the content itself; the context in, or purpose for which, it\nwas written; the audience to whom it was directed; and whether the writing was\nprepared by an employee acting or purporting to act within the scope of his or her\nemployment. Here, the City claimed all communications in personal accounts are\nbeyond the reach of CPRA. As a result, the content of specific records is not\nbefore us. Any disputes over this aspect of the “public records” definition await\nresolution in future proceedings.\n       We clarify, however, that to qualify as a public record under CPRA, at a\nminimum, a writing must relate in some substantive way to the conduct of the\npublic‟s business. This standard, though broad, is not so elastic as to include\nevery piece of information the public may find interesting. Communications that\nare primarily personal, containing no more than incidental mentions of agency\nbusiness, generally will not constitute public records. For example, the public\nmight be titillated to learn that not all agency workers enjoy the company of their\ncolleagues, or hold them in high regard. However, an employee‟s electronic\nmusings about a colleague‟s personal shortcomings will often fall far short of\nbeing a “writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public‟s\nbusiness.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).)4\n       Coronado Police Officers Assn. v. Carroll (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1001\ndemonstrates the intricacy of determining whether a writing is related to public\n\n\n4      We recognize that this test departs from the notion that “[o]nly purely\npersonal” communications “totally void of reference to governmental activities”\nare excluded from CPRA‟s definition of public records. (Assem. Statewide\nInformation Policy Com., Final Rep. (Mar. 1970) 1 Assem. J. (1970 Reg. Sess.)\nappen. p. 9; see San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at\np. 774.) While this conception may yield correct results in some circumstances, it\nmay sweep too broadly in others, particularly when applied to electronic\ncommunications sent through personal accounts.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fbusiness. There, police officers sought access to a database of impeachment\nmaterial compiled by public defenders. The attorneys contributed to the database\nand used its contents in their work. (Id. at p. 1005.) However, their representation\nof individual clients, though paid for by a public entity, was considered under case\nlaw to be essentially a private function. (Id. at pp. 1007-1009; see Polk County v.\nDodson (1981) 454 U.S. 312, 321-322.) Accordingly, the Coronado court\nconcluded the database did not relate to public business and thus was not a public\nrecord. (Id. at pp. 1007-1009.) The court was careful to note that not all\ndocuments related to the database were private, however. Documents reflecting\npolicy decisions about whether and how to maintain the database might well relate\nto public business, rather than the representation of individual clients. (Id. at\np. 1009.) Content of that kind would constitute public records. (Ibid.)\n       3.     Prepared by Any State or Local Agency\n       The City focuses its challenge on the final portion of the “public records”\ndefinition, which requires that writings be “prepared, owned, used, or retained by\nany state or local agency.” (§ 6252, section (e).) The City argues this language\ndoes not encompass communications agency employees make through their\npersonal accounts. However, the broad construction mandated by the Constitution\nsupports disclosure.\n       A writing is commonly understood to have been prepared by the person\nwho wrote it. If an agency employee prepares a writing that substantively relates\nto the conduct of public business, that writing would appear to satisfy the Act‟s\ndefinition of a public record. The City urges a contrary conclusion when the\nwriting is transmitted through a personal account. In focusing its attention on the\n“owned, used, or retained by” aspect of the “public records” definition, however, it\nignores the “prepared by” aspect. (§ 6252, subd. (e).) This approach fails to give\n“ „significance to every word, phrase, sentence, and part‟ ” of the Act. (Sierra\nClub v. Superior Court, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 166.)\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       The City draws its conclusion by comparing the Act‟s definitions of “local”\nand “state” agency. Under CPRA, “ „Local agency‟ includes a county; city,\nwhether general law or chartered; city and county; school district; municipal\ncorporation; district; political subdivision; or any board, commission or agency\nthereof; other local public agency; or entities that are legislative bodies of a local\nagency pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.” (§ 6252, subd. (a),\nitalics added.) The City points out that this definition does not specifically include\nindividual government officials or staff members, whereas individuals are\nspecifically mentioned in CPRA‟s definition of “state agency.” According to that\ndefinition, “ „State agency‟ means every state office, officer, department, division,\nbureau, board, and commission or other state body or agency, except those\nagencies provided for in Article IV (except Section 20 thereof) or Article VI of the\nCalifornia Constitution.”5 (§ 6252, subd. (f)(1), italics added.) The City contends\nthis difference shows the Legislature intended to exclude individuals from the\nlocal agency definition. If a local agency does not encompass individual officers\nand employees, it argues, only writings accessible to the agency as a whole are\npublic records. This interpretation is flawed for a number of reasons.\n       The City‟s narrow reading of CPRA‟s local agency definition is\ninconsistent with the constitutional directive of broad interpretation. (Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2); see Sierra Club v. Superior Court, supra, 57 Cal.4th at\np. 175.) Broadly construed, the term “local agency” logically includes not just the\ndiscrete governmental entities listed in section 6252, subdivision (a) but also the\nindividual officials and staff members who conduct the agencies‟ affairs. It is well\nestablished that a governmental entity, like a corporation, can act only through its\n\n\n5      Article IV establishes the Legislature, and article VI establishes the state‟s\njudiciary. (Cal. Const., arts. IV, VI.) These branches of government are thus\ngenerally exempt from CPRA. (See Sander v. State Bar of California, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 318; Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 106,\n111.)\n\n\n                                           9\n\findividual officers and employees. (Suezaki v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d\n166, 174; Alvarez v. Felker Mfg. Co. (1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 987, 998; see United\nStates v. Dotterweich (1943) 320 U.S. 277, 281; Reno v. Baird (1998) 18 Cal.4th\n640, 656.) A disembodied governmental agency cannot prepare, own, use, or\nretain any record. Only the human beings who serve in agencies can do these\nthings. When employees are conducting agency business, they are working for\nthe agency and on its behalf. (See, e.g., Cal. Assn. of Health Facilities v. Dept. of\nHealth Services (1997) 16 Cal.4th 284, 296-297; cf. Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy (D.C. Cir. 2016) 827 F.3d 145,\n149 [reaching the same conclusion for federal FOIA requests].). We presume the\nLegislature was aware of these settled principles. (See People v. Superior Court\n(Zamudio) (2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 199.) A writing prepared by a public employee\nconducting agency business has been “prepared by” the agency within the\nmeaning of section 6252, subdivision (e), even if the writing is prepared using the\nemployee‟s personal account.\n       The City also fails to explain how its proposed requirement that a public\nrecord be “accessible to the agency as a whole” could be practically interpreted.\nEven when documents were stored in filing cabinets or ledgers, many writings\nwould not have been considered accessible to all agency employees, regardless of\ntheir level of responsibility or involvement in a particular project.\n       Moreover, although employees are not specifically mentioned in the local\nagency definition, nothing in the statutory language indicates the Legislature\nmeant to exclude these individuals from CPRA obligations. The City argues the\nomission of the word “officer” from the local agency definition reflects a\nlegislative intent that CPRA apply to individuals who work in state agencies but\nnot employees in local government. The City offers no reason why the Legislature\nwould draw such an arbitrary distinction. If it intended to impose different\ndisclosure obligations on state and local agencies, one would expect to find this\ndifference highlighted throughout the statutory scheme, particularly when the\n\n\n                                          10\n\fobligations relate to a “fundamental and necessary right of every person in this\nstate.” (§ 6250.) Yet there is no mention of such an intent anywhere in the Act.\nIndeed, under the City‟s logic, CPRA obligations would potentially extend only to\nstate officers, not necessarily state employees. The distinction between tenured\npublic officers and those who hold public employment has long been recognized.\n(See In re M.M. (2012) 54 Cal.4th 530, 542-544.) Considering CPRA‟s goal of\npromoting public access, it would have been odd for the Legislature to establish\ndifferent rules for different levels of state employment. Contrary to the City‟s\nview, it seems more plausible that the reference to “every state . . . officer” in the\nstate agency definition (§ 6252, subd. (f)) was meant to extend CPRA obligations\nto elected state officers, such as the Governor, Treasurer, or Secretary of State,\nwho are not part of a collective governmental body nor generally considered\nemployees of a state agency.6\n       The City‟s position is further undermined by another CPRA provision,\nwhich indicates that public records can be held by individual officials and need not\nbelong to an agency as a whole. When it is alleged that public records have been\nimproperly withheld, section 6259, subdivision (a) directs that “the court shall\norder the officer or person charged with withholding the records” to disclose the\nrecords or show cause why they should not be produced. If the court concludes\n“the public official‟s decision to refuse disclosure is not justified,” it can order\n“the public official to make the record public.” (§ 6259, subd. (b).) If the court\n\n\n6       In one respect the local agency definition is worded more broadly than the\nstate agency definition. Section 6252, subdivision (a) states that the term local\nagency “includes” a county, city, or one of several other listed entities. In\nstatutory drafting, the term “includes” is ordinarily one “of enlargement rather\nthan limitation.” (Ornelas v. Randolph (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1101.) “The\n„statutory definition of a thing as “including” certain things does not necessarily\nplace thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.‟ ” (Flanagan v. Flanagan\n(2002) 27 Cal.4th 766, 774.) By contrast, the definition of “state agency” is\ncouched in more restrictive language: “ „State agency‟ means every state office,\nofficer . . .,” and other listed entities. (§ 6252, subd. (f), italics added.)\n\n\n                                           11\n\ffinds “that the public official was justified in refusing” disclosure, it must “return\nthe item to the public official without disclosing its content.” (Ibid.) The\nLegislature‟s repeated use of the singular word “official” in section 6259 indicates\nan awareness that an individual may possess materials that qualify as public\nrecords. Moreover, the broad term “public official” encompasses officials in state\nand local agencies, signifying that CPRA disclosure obligations apply to\nindividuals working in both levels of government.\n       4.     Owned, Used, or Retained by Any State or Local Agency\n       CPRA encompasses writings prepared by an agency but also writings it\nowns, uses, or retains, regardless of authorship. Obviously, an agency engaged in\nthe conduct of public business will use and retain a variety of writings related to\nthat business, including those prepared by people outside the agency. These final\ntwo factors of the “public records” definition, use and retention, thus reflect the\nvariety of ways an agency can possess writings used to conduct public business.\n       As to retention, the City argues “public records” include only materials in\nan agency‟s possession or directly accessible to the agency. Citing statutory\narguments and cases limiting the duty to obtain and disclose documents possessed\nby others, the City contends writings held in an employee‟s personal account are\nbeyond an agency‟s reach and fall outside CPRA. The argument fails.\n       Appellate courts have generally concluded records related to public\nbusiness are subject to disclosure if they are in an agency‟s actual or constructive\npossession. (See, e.g., Board of Pilot Comrs. for the Bays of San Francisco, San\nPablo and Suisun v. Superior Court (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 577, 598;\nConsolidated Irrigation Dist. v. Superior Court (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 697, 710\n(Consolidated Irrigation).) “[A]n agency has constructive possession of records if\nit has the right to control the records, either directly or through another person.”\n(Consolidated Irrigation, at p. 710.) For example, in Consolidated Irrigation, a\ncity did not have constructive possession of documents in files maintained by\nsubconsultants who prepared portions of an environmental impact report because\n\n\n                                          12\n\fthe city had no contractual right to control the subconsultants or their files. (Id. at\npp. 703, 710-711.) By contrast, a city had a CPRA duty to disclose a consultant‟s\nfield survey records because the city had a contractual ownership interest and right\nto possess this material. (See Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National\nCity (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1426, 1428-1429 (Community Youth).)\n       An agency‟s actual or constructive possession of records is relevant in\ndetermining whether it has an obligation to search for, collect, and disclose the\nmaterial requested. (See § 6253, subd. (c).) It is a separate and more fundamental\nquestion whether a document located outside an agency‟s walls, or servers, is\nsufficiently “owned, used, or retained” by the agency so as to constitute a public\nrecord. (See § 6252, subd. (e).) In construing FOIA, federal courts have remarked\nthat an agency‟s public records “do not lose their agency character just because the\nofficial who possesses them takes them out the door.” (Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy, supra, 827 F.3d at p. 149.)\nWe likewise hold that documents otherwise meeting CPRA‟s definition of “public\nrecords” do not lose this status because they are located in an employee‟s personal\naccount. A writing retained by a public employee conducting agency business has\nbeen “retained by” the agency within the meaning of section 6252, subdivision (e),\neven if the writing is retained in the employee‟s personal account.\n       The City argues various CPRA provisions run counter to this conclusion.\nFirst, the City cites section 6270, which provides that a state or local agency may\nnot transfer a public record to a private entity in a manner that prevents the agency\n“from providing the record directly pursuant to this chapter.” (Italics added.)\nTaking the italicized language out of context, the City argues that public records\nare only those an agency is able to access “directly.” But this strained\ninterpretation sets legislative intent on its head. The statute‟s clear purpose is to\nprevent an agency from evading its disclosure duty by transferring custody of a\nrecord to a private holder and then arguing the record falls outside CPRA because\nit is no longer in the agency‟s possession. Furthermore, section 6270 does not\n\n\n                                          13\n\fpurport to excuse agencies from obtaining public records in the possession of their\nown employees. It simply prohibits agencies from attempting to evade CPRA by\ntransferring public records to an intermediary not bound by the Act‟s disclosure\nrequirements.\n       Next, the City relies on section 6253.9, subdivision (a)(1), which states that\nan agency must make a public record available “in any electronic format in which\nit holds the information” (italics added), and on section 6253, subdivision (a),\nwhich requires that public records be available for inspection “during . . . office\nhours.” These provisions do not assist the City. They merely address the\nmechanics of how public records must be disclosed. They do not purport to define\nor limit what constitutes a public record in the first place. Moreover, to say that\nonly public records “in the possession of the agency” (§ 6253, subd. (c)) must be\ndisclosed begs the question of whether the term “agency” includes individual\nofficers and employees. We have concluded it does.\n       Under the City‟s interpretation of CPRA, a document concerning official\nbusiness is only a public record if it is located on a government agency‟s computer\nservers or in its offices. Indirect access, through the agency‟s employees, is not\nsufficient in the City‟s view. However, we have previously stressed that a\ndocument‟s status as public or confidential does not turn on the arbitrary\ncircumstance of where the document is located.\n       In Commission on Peace Officer Standards, supra, 42 Cal.4th at pages 289\nto 290, a state agency argued certain employment information was exempt from\ndisclosure under CPRA because it had been placed in confidential personnel files.\nIn considering a Penal Code provision that deems peace officer personnel records\nconfidential, we rejected an interpretation that made confidentiality turn on the\ntype of file in which records are located, finding it “unlikely the Legislature\nintended to render documents confidential based on their location, rather than their\ncontent.” (Commission, at p. 291.) Although we made this observation in\nanalyzing the scope of a CPRA exemption, the same logic applies to the Act‟s\n\n\n                                          14\n\fdefinition of what constitutes a public record in the first place. We found it\nunlikely “the Legislature intended that a public agency be able to shield\ninformation from public disclosure simply by placing it in” a certain type of file.\n(Commission, at p. 291.) Likewise, there is no indication the Legislature meant to\nallow public officials to shield communications about official business simply by\ndirecting them through personal accounts. Such an expedient would gut the\npublic‟s presumptive right of access (Sander v. State Bar of California, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 323), and the constitutional imperative to broadly construe this right\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2)).\n       In light of these principles, and considering section 6252, subdivision (e) in\nthe context of the Act as a whole (see Smith v. Superior Court (2006) 39 Cal.4th\n77, 83), we conclude a city employee‟s communications related to the conduct of\npublic business do not cease to be public records just because they were sent or\nreceived using a personal account. Sound public policy supports this result.\nB.     Policy Considerations\n       Both sides cite policy considerations to support their interpretation of the\n“public records” definition. The City argues the definition reflects a legislative\nbalance between the public‟s right of access and individual employees‟ privacy\nrights, and should be interpreted categorically. Smith counters that privacy\nconcerns are properly addressed in the case-specific application of CPRA‟s\nexemptions, not in defining the overall scope of a public record. Smith also\ncontends any privacy intrusion resulting from a search for records in personal\naccounts can be minimized through procedural safeguards. Smith has the better of\nthese arguments.\n       The City‟s interpretation would allow evasion of CPRA simply by the use\nof a personal account. We are aware of no California law requiring that public\nofficials or employees use only government accounts to conduct public business.\nIf communications sent through personal accounts were categorically excluded\nfrom CPRA, government officials could hide their most sensitive, and potentially\n\n\n                                            15\n\fdamning, discussions in such accounts. The City‟s interpretation “would not only\nput an increasing amount of information beyond the public‟s grasp but also\nencourage government officials to conduct the public‟s business in private.”\n(Senat, Whose Business Is It: Is Public Business Conducted on Officials’ Personal\nElectronic Devices Subject to State Open Records Laws? (2014) 19 Comm. L. &\nPol‟y 293, 322.)\n       It is no answer to say, as did the Court of Appeal, that we must presume\npublic officials conduct official business in the public‟s best interest. The\nConstitution neither creates nor requires such an optimistic presumption. Indeed,\nthe rationale behind the Act is that it is for the public to make that determination,\nbased on information to which it is entitled under the law. Open access to\ngovernment records is essential to verify that government officials are acting\nresponsibly and held accountable to the public they serve. (CBS, Inc. v. Block\n(1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 651.) “Such access permits checks against the arbitrary\nexercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.” (Ibid.) The whole\npurpose of CPRA is to ensure transparency in government activities. If public\nofficials could evade the law simply by clicking into a different email account, or\ncommunicating through a personal device, sensitive information could routinely\nevade public scrutiny.\n       The City counters that the privacy interests of government employees\nweigh against interpreting “public records” to include material in personal\naccounts. Of course, public employees do not forfeit all rights to privacy by\nworking for the government. (Long Beach City Employees Assn. v. City of Long\nBeach (1986) 41 Cal.3d 937, 951.) Even so, the City essentially argues that the\ncontents of personal email and other messaging accounts should be categorically\nexcluded from public review because these materials have traditionally been\nconsidered private. However, compliance with CPRA is not necessarily\ninconsistent with the privacy rights of public employees. Any personal\ninformation not related to the conduct of public business, or material falling under\n\n\n                                          16\n\fa statutory exemption, can be redacted from public records that are produced or\npresented for review. (See § 6253, subd. (a).)\n       Furthermore, a crabbed and categorical interpretation of the “public\nrecords” definition is unnecessary to protect employee privacy. Privacy concerns\ncan and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. (See International\nFederation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 329.) Beyond the definition of a public record,\nthe Act itself limits or exempts disclosure of various kinds of information,\nincluding certain types of preliminary drafts, notes, or memoranda (§ 6254,\nsubd. (a)), personal financial data (§ 6254, subd. (n)), personnel and medical files\n(§ 6254, subd. (c)), and material protected by evidentiary privileges (§ 6254,\nsubd. (k)). Finally, a catchall exemption allows agencies to withhold any record if\nthe public interest served by withholding it “clearly outweighs” the public interest\nin disclosure. (§ 6255, subd. (a).) This exemption permits a balance between the\npublic‟s interest in disclosure and the individual‟s privacy interest. (International\nFederation, at pp. 329-330; BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th\n742, 755-756.) The analysis here, as with other exemptions, appropriately focuses\non the content of specific records rather than their location or medium of\ncommunication. (See Commission on Peace Officer Standards, supra, 42 Cal.4th\nat p. 291.)7\n\n\n\n\n7      While admitting it invoked no CPRA exemptions in the proceedings below,\nthe City nevertheless asks us to decide that messages in employees‟ personal\naccounts are universally exempt from disclosure under section 6255. This issue\nhas not been preserved and is beyond the scope of our grant of review. It also\nappears impossible to decide on this record. Answering threshold questions about\nwhether employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy (see Hill v. National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35), or whether their messages are\ncovered by the “deliberative process” privilege (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior\nCourt (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1339-1344) would require a fact-intensive review of\nthe City‟s policies and practices regarding electronic communications, if not the\ncontents of the challenged documents themselves. The record here is insufficient.\n\n\n                                         17\n\f       The City also contends the search for public records in employees‟\naccounts would itself raise privacy concerns. In order to search for responsive\ndocuments, the City claims agencies would have to demand the surrender of\nemployees‟ electronic devices and passwords to their personal accounts. Such a\nsearch would be tantamount to invading employees‟ homes and rifling through\ntheir filing cabinets, the City argues. It urges no case has extended CPRA so far.\n       Arguments that privacy interests outweigh the need for disclosure in CPRA\ncases have typically focused on the sensitive content of the documents involved,\nrather than the intrusiveness involved in searching for them. (See, e.g.,\nInternational Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th 319; Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1272.) Assuming the search for responsive documents\ncan also constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, however, this concern\nalone does not tip the policy balance in the City‟s favor. Searches can be\nconducted in a manner that respects individual privacy.\n       C.        Guidance for Conducting Searches\n       The City has not attempted to search for documents located in personal\naccounts, so the legality of a specific kind of search is not before us. However, the\nCity and some amici curiae do highlight concerns about employee privacy. Some\nguidance about how to strike the balance between privacy and disclosure may be\nof assistance.\n       CPRA requests invariably impose some burden on public agencies. Unless\na records request is overbroad or unduly burdensome, agencies are obliged to\ndisclose all records they can locate “with reasonable effort.” (California First\nAmendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159, 166.)\nReasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake extraordinarily extensive\nor intrusive searches, however. (See American Civil Liberties Union Foundation\nv. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 453; Bertoli v. City of Sebastopol (2015) 233\nCal.App.4th 353, 371-372.) In general, the scope of an agency‟s search for public\nrecords “need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents.”\n\n\n                                         18\n\f(American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202\nCal.App.4th 55, 85; see Community Youth, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.)\n       CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of searching for those\ndocuments. Agencies may develop their own internal policies for conducting\nsearches. Some general principles have emerged, however. Once an agency\nreceives a CPRA request, it must “communicate the scope of the information\nrequested to the custodians of its records,” although it need not use the precise\nlanguage of the request. (Community Youth, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 1417.)\nAs to requests seeking public records held in employees‟ nongovernmental\naccounts, an agency‟s first step should be to communicate the request to the\nemployees in question. The agency may then reasonably rely on these employees\nto search their own personal files, accounts, and devices for responsive material.\n       Federal courts applying FOIA have approved of individual employees\nconducting their own searches and segregating public records from personal\nrecords, so long as the employees have been properly trained in how to distinguish\nbetween the two. (See Ethyl Corp. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (4th\nCir. 1994) 25 F.3d 1241, 1247.) A federal employee who withholds a document\nidentified as potentially responsive may submit an affidavit providing the agency,\nand a reviewing court, “with a sufficient factual basis upon which to determine\nwhether contested items were „agency records‟ or personal materials.” (Grand\nCent. Partnership, Inc. v. Cuomo (2d Cir. 1999) 166 F.3d 473, 481.) The\nWashington Supreme Court recently adopted this procedure under its state public\nrecords law, holding that employees who withhold personal records from their\nemployer “must submit an affidavit with facts sufficient to show the information is\nnot a „public record‟ under the PRA. So long as the affidavits give the requester\nand the trial court a sufficient factual basis to determine that withheld material is\nindeed nonresponsive, the agency has performed an adequate search under the\nPRA.” (Nissen v. Pierce County (Wn. 2015) 183 Wn.2d 863 [357 P.3d 45, 57].)\nWe agree with Washington‟s high court that this procedure, when followed in\n\n\n                                          19\n\fgood faith, strikes an appropriate balance, allowing a public agency “to fulfill its\nresponsibility to search for and disclose public records without unnecessarily\ntreading on the constitutional rights of its employees.” (Id., 357 P.3d at p. 58.)\n       Further, agencies can adopt policies that will reduce the likelihood of public\nrecords being held in employees‟ private accounts. “Agencies are in the best\nposition to implement policies that fulfill their obligations” under public records\nlaws “yet also preserve the privacy rights of their employees.” (Nissen v. Pierce\nCounty, supra, 357 P.3d at p. 58.) For example, agencies might require that\nemployees use or copy their government accounts for all communications\ntouching on public business. Federal agency employees must follow such\nprocedures to ensure compliance with analogous FOIA requests. (See 44 U.S.C.\n§ 2911(a) [prohibiting use of personal electronic accounts for official business\nunless messages are copied or forwarded to an official account]; 36 C.F.R.\n§ 1236.22(b) (2016) [requiring that agencies ensure official email messages in\nemployees‟ personal accounts are preserved in the agency‟s recordkeeping\nsystem]; Landmark Legal Foundation v. Environmental Protection Agency\n(D.D.C. 2015) 82 F.Supp.3d 211, 225-226 [encouraging a policy that official\nemails be preserved in employees‟ personal accounts as well].)\n       We do not hold that any particular search method is required or necessarily\nadequate. We mention these alternatives to offer guidance on remand and to\nexplain why privacy concerns do not require categorical exclusion of documents\nin personal accounts from CPRA‟s “public records” definition. If the City\nmaintains the burden of obtaining records from personal accounts is too onerous, it\nwill have an opportunity to so establish in future proceedings. (See Connell v.\nSuperior Court (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 601, 615-616; State Bd. of Equalization v.\nSuperior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1188.)\nD.     Conclusion\n       Consistent with the Legislature‟s purpose in enacting CPRA, and our\nconstitutional mandate to interpret the Act broadly in favor of public access (Cal.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fConst., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2)), we hold that a city employee‟s writings about\npublic business are not excluded from CPRA simply because they have been sent,\nreceived, or stored in a personal account.\n                                   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                  CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

All statutory references are to the\nGovernment Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                          1\n\fstaffs.2 The targeted documents concerned redevelopment efforts in downtown\nSan Jose and included emails and text messages “sent or received on private\nelectronic devices used by” the mayor, two city council members, and their staffs.\nThe City disclosed communications made using City telephone numbers and email\naccounts but did not disclose communications made using the individuals‟\npersonal accounts.\n       Smith sued for declaratory relief, arguing CPRA‟s definition of “public\nrecords” encompasses all communications about official business, regardless of\nhow they are created, communicated, or stored. The City responded that messages\ncommunicated through personal accounts are not public records because they are\nnot within the public entity‟s custody or control. The trial court granted summary\njudgment for Smith and ordered disclosure, but the Court of Appeal issued a writ\nof mandate. At present, no documents from employees‟ personal accounts have\nbeen collected or disclosed.\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n       This case concerns how laws, originally designed to cover paper\ndocuments, apply to evolving methods of electronic communication. It requires\nrecognition that, in today‟s environment, not all employment-related activity\noccurs during a conventional workday, or in an employer-maintained workplace.\n       Enacted in 1968, CPRA declares that “access to information concerning the\nconduct of the people‟s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every\nperson in this state.” (§ 6250.) In 2004, voters made this principle part of our\nConstitution. A provision added by Proposition 59 states: “The people have the\nright of access to information concerning the conduct of the people‟s business,\nand, therefore, . . . the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to\npublic scrutiny.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1).) Public access laws serve a\n\n\n2      These parties, sued as defendants below and the petitioners here, are\ncollectively referred to as the “City.”\n\n\n                                           2\n\fcrucial function. “Openness in government is essential to the functioning of a\ndemocracy. „Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government\nshould be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals\nmust have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the\narbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.‟ ”\n(International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 21,\nAFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518991/international-federation-of-professional-and-technical-engineers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328-329 (International\nFederation).)\n       However, public access to information must sometimes yield to personal\nprivacy interests. When enacting CPRA, the Legislature was mindful of the right\nto privacy (§ 6250), and set out multiple exemptions designed to protect that right.\n(Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (Commission on Peace Officer Standards); see § 6254.)\nSimilarly, while the Constitution provides for public access, it does not supersede\nor modify existing privacy rights. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(3).)\n       CPRA and the Constitution strike a careful balance between public access\nand personal privacy. This case concerns how that balance is served when\ndocuments concerning official business are created or stored outside the\nworkplace. The issue is a narrow one: Are writings concerning the conduct of\npublic business beyond CPRA‟s reach merely because they were sent or received\nusing a nongovernmental account? Considering the statute‟s language and the\nimportant policy interests it serves, the answer is no. Employees‟ communications\nabout official agency business may be subject to CPRA regardless of the type of\naccount used in their preparation or transmission.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fA.     Statutory Language, Broadly Construed, Supports Public Access\n       CPRA establishes a basic rule requiring disclosure of public records upon\nrequest. (§ 6253.)3 In general, it creates “a presumptive right of access to any\nrecord created or maintained by a public agency that relates in any way to the\nbusiness of the public agency.” (Sander v. State Bar of California (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323, italics added.) Every such record “must be disclosed unless a\nstatutory exception is shown.” (Ibid.) Section 6254 sets out a variety of\nexemptions, “many of which are designed to protect individual privacy.”\n(International Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 329.) The Act also includes a\ncatchall provision exempting disclosure if “the public interest served by not\ndisclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.”\n(§ 6255, subd. (a).)\n       “When we interpret a statute, „[o]ur fundamental task . . . is to determine\nthe Legislature‟s intent so as to effectuate the law‟s purpose. We first examine the\nstatutory language, giving it a plain and commonsense meaning. We do not\nexamine that language in isolation, but in the context of the statutory framework as\na whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various\nparts of the enactment. If the language is clear, courts must generally follow its\nplain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences\nthe Legislature did not intend. If the statutory language permits more than one\nreasonable interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as the statute‟s\npurpose, legislative history, and public policy.‟ [Citation.] „Furthermore, we\nconsider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory\nscheme of which it is a part, giving significance to every word, phrase, sentence,\nand part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.‟ ” (Sierra Club v.\nSuperior Court (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165-166.)\n\n3      CPRA was modeled on the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5\nU.S.C. § 552). (San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">762</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 772.)\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       In CPRA cases, this standard approach to statutory interpretation is\naugmented by a constitutional imperative. (See Sierra Club v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 166.) Proposition 59 amended the Constitution to provide:\n“A statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective\ndate of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people‟s right\nof access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.” (Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2), italics added.) “ „Given the strong public policy of the\npeople‟s right to information concerning the people‟s business (Gov. Code,\n§ 6250), and the constitutional mandate to construe statutes limiting the right of\naccess narrowly (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2)), “all public records are\nsubject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the\ncontrary.” ‟ ” (Sierra Club, at p. 166.)\n       We begin with the term “public record,” which CPRA defines to include\n“any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public‟s\nbusiness prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless\nof physical form or characteristics.” (§ 6252, subd. (e); hereafter “public records”\ndefinition.) Under this definition, a public record has four aspects. It is (1) a\nwriting, (2) with content relating to the conduct of the public‟s business, which is\n(3) prepared by, or (4) owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency.\n       1.     Writing\n       CPRA defines a “writing” as “any handwriting, typewriting, printing,\nphotostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or\nfacsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of\ncommunication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or\nsymbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of\nthe manner in which the record has been stored.” (§ 6252, subd. (g).) It is\nundisputed that the items at issue here constitute writings.\n       In 1968, creating a “writing” could be a fairly involved process. Typically,\na person would use an implement to type, or record words longhand, or would\n\n\n                                           5\n\fdictate to someone else who would write or type a document. Writings were\ngenerally made on paper or some other tangible medium. These writings were\nphysically identifiable and could be retrieved by examining the physical\nrepositories where they were stored. Writings exchanged with people outside the\nagency were generally sent, on paper, through the mail or by courier. In part\nbecause of the time required for their preparation, such writings were fairly formal\nand focused on the business at hand.\n       Today, these tangible, if laborious, writing methods have been enhanced by\nelectronic communication. Email, text messaging, and other electronic platforms,\npermit writings to be prepared, exchanged, and stored more quickly and easily.\nHowever, the ease and immediacy of electronic communication has encouraged a\ncommonplace tendency to share fleeting thoughts and random bits of information,\nwith varying degrees of import, often to broad audiences. As a result, the line\nbetween an official communication and an electronic aside is now sometimes\nblurred. The second aspect of CPRA‟s “public records” definition establishes a\nframework to distinguish between work-related and purely private\ncommunications.\n       2.     Relating to the Conduct of the Public’s Business\n       The overall structure of CPRA, with its many exemptions, makes clear that\nnot everything written by a public employee is subject to review and disclosure.\nTo qualify as a public record, a writing must “contain[] information relating to the\nconduct of the public‟s business.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).) Generally, any “record . . .\nkept by an officer because it is necessary or convenient to the discharge of his\nofficial duty . . . is a public record.” (Braun v. City of Taft (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340; see People v. Purcell (1937) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130.)\n       Whether a writing is sufficiently related to public business will not always\nbe clear. For example, depending on the context, an email to a spouse\ncomplaining “my coworker is an idiot” would likely not be a public record.\nConversely, an email to a superior reporting the coworker‟s mismanagement of an\n\n\n                                          6\n\fagency project might well be. Resolution of the question, particularly when\nwritings are kept in personal accounts, will often involve an examination of\nseveral factors, including the content itself; the context in, or purpose for which, it\nwas written; the audience to whom it was directed; and whether the writing was\nprepared by an employee acting or purporting to act within the scope of his or her\nemployment. Here, the City claimed all communications in personal accounts are\nbeyond the reach of CPRA. As a result, the content of specific records is not\nbefore us. Any disputes over this aspect of the “public records” definition await\nresolution in future proceedings.\n       We clarify, however, that to qualify as a public record under CPRA, at a\nminimum, a writing must relate in some substantive way to the conduct of the\npublic‟s business. This standard, though broad, is not so elastic as to include\nevery piece of information the public may find interesting. Communications that\nare primarily personal, containing no more than incidental mentions of agency\nbusiness, generally will not constitute public records. For example, the public\nmight be titillated to learn that not all agency workers enjoy the company of their\ncolleagues, or hold them in high regard. However, an employee‟s electronic\nmusings about a colleague‟s personal shortcomings will often fall far short of\nbeing a “writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public‟s\nbusiness.” (§ 6252, subd. (e).)4\n       Coronado Police Officers Assn. v. Carroll (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\ndemonstrates the intricacy of determining whether a writing is related to public\n\n\n4      We recognize that this test departs from the notion that “[o]nly purely\npersonal” communications “totally void of reference to governmental activities”\nare excluded from CPRA‟s definition of public records. (Assem. Statewide\nInformation Policy Com., Final Rep. (Mar. 1970) 1 Assem. J. (1970 Reg. Sess.)\nappen. p. 9; see San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at\np. 774.) While this conception may yield correct results in some circumstances, it\nmay sweep too broadly in others, particularly when applied to electronic\ncommunications sent through personal accounts.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fbusiness. There, police officers sought access to a database of impeachment\nmaterial compiled by public defenders. The attorneys contributed to the database\nand used its contents in their work. (Id. at p. 1005.) However, their representation\nof individual clients, though paid for by a public entity, was considered under case\nlaw to be essentially a private function. (Id. at pp. 1007-1009; see Polk County v.\nDodson (1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110589\"><a href=\"/opinion/110589/polk-county-v-dodson/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321-322.) Accordingly, the Coronado court\nconcluded the database did not relate to public business and thus was not a public\nrecord. (Id. at pp. 1007-1009.) The court was careful to note that not all\ndocuments related to the database were private, however. Documents reflecting\npolicy decisions about whether and how to maintain the database might well relate\nto public business, rather than the representation of individual clients. (Id. at\np. 1009.) Content of that kind would constitute public records. (Ibid.)\n       3.     Prepared by Any State or Local Agency\n       The City focuses its challenge on the final portion of the “public records”\ndefinition, which requires that writings be “prepared, owned, used, or retained by\nany state or local agency.” (§ 6252, section (e).) The City argues this language\ndoes not encompass communications agency employees make through their\npersonal accounts. However, the broad construction mandated by the Constitution\nsupports disclosure.\n       A writing is commonly understood to have been prepared by the person\nwho wrote it. If an agency employee prepares a writing that substantively relates\nto the conduct of public business, that writing would appear to satisfy the Act‟s\ndefinition of a public record. The City urges a contrary conclusion when the\nwriting is transmitted through a personal account. In focusing its attention on the\n“owned, used, or retained by” aspect of the “public records” definition, however, it\nignores the “prepared by” aspect. (§ 6252, subd. (e).) This approach fails to give\n“ „significance to every word, phrase, sentence, and part‟ ” of the Act. (Sierra\nClub v. Superior Court, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 166.)\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       The City draws its conclusion by comparing the Act‟s definitions of “local”\nand “state” agency. Under CPRA, “ „Local agency‟ includes a county; city,\nwhether general law or chartered; city and county; school district; municipal\ncorporation; district; political subdivision; or any board, commission or agency\nthereof; other local public agency; or entities that are legislative bodies of a local\nagency pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.” (§ 6252, subd. (a),\nitalics added.) The City points out that this definition does not specifically include\nindividual government officials or staff members, whereas individuals are\nspecifically mentioned in CPRA‟s definition of “state agency.” According to that\ndefinition, “ „State agency‟ means every state office, officer, department, division,\nbureau, board, and commission or other state body or agency, except those\nagencies provided for in Article IV (except Section 20 thereof) or Article VI of the\nCalifornia Constitution.”5 (§ 6252, subd. (f)(1), italics added.) The City contends\nthis difference shows the Legislature intended to exclude individuals from the\nlocal agency definition. If a local agency does not encompass individual officers\nand employees, it argues, only writings accessible to the agency as a whole are\npublic records. This interpretation is flawed for a number of reasons.\n       The City‟s narrow reading of CPRA‟s local agency definition is\ninconsistent with the constitutional directive of broad interpretation. (Cal. Const.,\nart. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2); see Sierra Club v. Superior Court, supra, 57 Cal.4th at\np. 175.) Broadly construed, the term “local agency” logically includes not just the\ndiscrete governmental entities listed in section 6252, subdivision (a) but also the\nindividual officials and staff members who conduct the agencies‟ affairs. It is well\nestablished that a governmental entity, like a corporation, can act only through its\n\n\n5      Article IV establishes the Legislature, and article VI establishes the state‟s\njudiciary. (Cal. Const., arts. IV, VI.) These branches of government are thus\ngenerally exempt from CPRA. (See Sander v. State Bar of California, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 318; Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A disembodied governmental agency cannot prepare, own, use, or\nretain any record. Only the human beings who serve in agencies can do these\nthings. When employees are conducting agency business, they are working for\nthe agency and on its behalf. (See, e.g., Cal. Assn. of Health Facilities v. Dept. of\nHealth Services (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296-297; cf.

We presume the\nLegislature was aware of these settled principles. (See People v. Superior Court\n(Zamudio) (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1159607\"><a href=\"/opinion/1159607/people-v-superior-court-zamudio/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199.) A writing prepared by a public employee\nconducting agency business has been “prepared by” the agency within the\nmeaning of section 6252, subdivision (e), even if the writing is prepared using the\nemployee‟s personal account.\n       The City also fails to explain how its proposed requirement that a public\nrecord be “accessible to the agency as a whole” could be practically interpreted.\nEven when documents were stored in filing cabinets or ledgers, many writings\nwould not have been considered accessible to all agency employees, regardless of\ntheir level of responsibility or involvement in a particular project.\n       Moreover, although employees are not specifically mentioned in the local\nagency definition, nothing in the statutory language indicates the Legislature\nmeant to exclude these individuals from CPRA obligations. The City argues the\nomission of the word “officer” from the local agency definition reflects a\nlegislative intent that CPRA apply to individuals who work in state agencies but\nnot employees in local government. The City offers no reason why the Legislature\nwould draw such an arbitrary distinction. If it intended to impose different\ndisclosure obligations on state and local agencies, one would expect to find this\ndifference highlighted throughout the statutory scheme, particularly when the\n\n\n                                          10\n\fobligations relate to a “fundamental and necessary right of every person in this\nstate.” (§ 6250.) Yet there is no mention of such an intent anywhere in the Act.\nIndeed, under the City‟s logic, CPRA obligations would potentially extend only to\nstate officers, not necessarily state employees. The distinction between tenured\npublic officers and those who hold public employment has long been recognized.\n(See In re M.M. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542-544.) Considering CPRA‟s goal of\npromoting public access, it would have been odd for the Legislature to establish\ndifferent rules for different levels of state employment. Contrary to the City‟s\nview, it seems more plausible that the reference to “every state . . . officer” in the\nstate agency definition (§ 6252, subd. (f)) was meant to extend CPRA obligations\nto elected state officers, such as the Governor, Treasurer, or Secretary of State,\nwho are not part of a collective governmental body nor generally considered\nemployees of a state agency.6\n       The City‟s position is further undermined by another CPRA provision,\nwhich indicates that public records can be held by individual officials and need not\nbelong to an agency as a whole. When it is alleged that public records have been\nimproperly withheld, section 6259, subdivision (a) directs that “the court shall\norder the officer or person charged with withholding the records” to disclose the\nrecords or show cause why they should not be produced. If the court concludes\n“the public official‟s decision to refuse disclosure is not justified,” it can order\n“the public official to make the record public.” (§ 6259, subd. (b).) If the court\n\n\n6       In one respect the local agency definition is worded more broadly than the\nstate agency definition. Section 6252, subdivision (a) states that the term local\nagency “includes” a county, city, or one of several other listed entities. In\nstatutory drafting, the term “includes” is ordinarily one “of enlargement rather\nthan limitation.” (Ornelas v. Randolph (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614919/ornelas-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1101.) “The\n„statutory definition of a thing as “including” certain things does not necessarily\nplace thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.‟ ” (Flanagan v. Flanagan\n(2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600714/flanagan-v-flanagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774.) By contrast, the definition of “state agency” is\ncouched in more restrictive language: “ „State agency‟ means every state office,\nofficer . . .,” and other listed entities. (§ 6252, subd. (f), italics added.)\n\n\n                                           11\n\ffinds “that the public official was justified in refusing” disclosure, it must “return\nthe item to the public official without disclosing its content.” (Ibid.) The\nLegislature‟s repeated use of the singular word “official” in section 6259 indicates\nan awareness that an individual may possess materials that qualify as public\nrecords. Moreover, the broad term “public official” encompasses officials in state\nand local agencies, signifying that CPRA disclosure obligations apply to\nindividuals working in both levels of government.\n       4.     Owned, Used, or Retained by Any State or Local Agency\n       CPRA encompasses writings prepared by an agency but also writings it\nowns, uses, or retains, regardless of authorship. Obviously, an agency engaged in\nthe conduct of public business will use and retain a variety of writings related to\nthat business, including those prepared by people outside the agency. These final\ntwo factors of the “public records” definition, use and retention, thus reflect the\nvariety of ways an agency can possess writings used to conduct public business.\n       As to retention, the City argues “public records” include only materials in\nan agency‟s possession or directly accessible to the agency. Citing statutory\narguments and cases limiting the duty to obtain and disclose documents possessed\nby others, the City contends writings held in an employee‟s personal account are\nbeyond an agency‟s reach and fall outside CPRA. The argument fails.\n       Appellate courts have generally concluded records related to public\nbusiness are subject to disclosure if they are in an agency‟s actual or constructive\npossession. (See, e.g., Board of Pilot Comrs. for the Bays of San Francisco, San\nPablo and Suisun v. Superior Court (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

For example, in Consolidated Irrigation, a\ncity did not have constructive possession of documents in files maintained by\nsubconsultants who prepared portions of an environmental impact report because\n\n\n                                          12\n\fthe city had no contractual right to control the subconsultants or their files. (Id. at\npp. 703, 710-711.) By contrast, a city had a CPRA duty to disclose a consultant‟s\nfield survey records because the city had a contractual ownership interest and right\nto possess this material. (See Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National\nCity (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1385</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1426, 1428-1429 (Community Youth).)\n       An agency‟s actual or constructive possession of records is relevant in\ndetermining whether it has an obligation to search for, collect, and disclose the\nmaterial requested. (See § 6253, subd. (c).) It is a separate and more fundamental\nquestion whether a document located outside an agency‟s walls, or servers, is\nsufficiently “owned, used, or retained” by the agency so as to constitute a public\nrecord. (See § 6252, subd. (e).) In construing FOIA, federal courts have remarked\nthat an agency‟s public records “do not lose their agency character just because the\nofficial who possesses them takes them out the door.” (Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy, supra, 827 F.3d at p. 149.)\nWe likewise hold that documents otherwise meeting CPRA‟s definition of “public\nrecords” do not lose this status because they are located in an employee‟s personal\naccount. A writing retained by a public employee conducting agency business has\nbeen “retained by” the agency within the meaning of section 6252, subdivision (e),\neven if the writing is retained in the employee‟s personal account.\n       The City argues various CPRA provisions run counter to this conclusion.\nFirst, the City cites section 6270, which provides that a state or local agency may\nnot transfer a public record to a private entity in a manner that prevents the agency\n“from providing the record directly pursuant to this chapter.” (Italics added.)\nTaking the italicized language out of context, the City argues that public records\nare only those an agency is able to access “directly.” But this strained\ninterpretation sets legislative intent on its head. The statute‟s clear purpose is to\nprevent an agency from evading its disclosure duty by transferring custody of a\nrecord to a private holder and then arguing the record falls outside CPRA because\nit is no longer in the agency‟s possession. Furthermore, section 6270 does not\n\n\n                                          13\n\fpurport to excuse agencies from obtaining public records in the possession of their\nown employees. It simply prohibits agencies from attempting to evade CPRA by\ntransferring public records to an intermediary not bound by the Act‟s disclosure\nrequirements.\n       Next, the City relies on section 6253.9, subdivision (a)(1), which states that\nan agency must make a public record available “in any electronic format in which\nit holds the information” (italics added), and on section 6253, subdivision (a),\nwhich requires that public records be available for inspection “during . . . office\nhours.” These provisions do not assist the City. They merely address the\nmechanics of how public records must be disclosed. They do not purport to define\nor limit what constitutes a public record in the first place. Moreover, to say that\nonly public records “in the possession of the agency” (§ 6253, subd. (c)) must be\ndisclosed begs the question of whether the term “agency” includes individual\nofficers and employees. We have concluded it does.\n       Under the City‟s interpretation of CPRA, a document concerning official\nbusiness is only a public record if it is located on a government agency‟s computer\nservers or in its offices. Indirect access, through the agency‟s employees, is not\nsufficient in the City‟s view. However, we have previously stressed that a\ndocument‟s status as public or confidential does not turn on the arbitrary\ncircumstance of where the document is located.\n       In Commission on Peace Officer Standards, supra, 42 Cal.4th at pages 289\nto 290, a state agency argued certain employment information was exempt from\ndisclosure under CPRA because it had been placed in confidential personnel files.\nIn considering a Penal Code provision that deems peace officer personnel records\nconfidential, we rejected an interpretation that made confidentiality turn on the\ntype of file in which records are located, finding it “unlikely the Legislature\nintended to render documents confidential based on their location, rather than their\ncontent.” (Commission, at p. 291.) Although we made this observation in\nanalyzing the scope of a CPRA exemption, the same logic applies to the Act‟s\n\n\n                                          14\n\fdefinition of what constitutes a public record in the first place. We found it\nunlikely “the Legislature intended that a public agency be able to shield\ninformation from public disclosure simply by placing it in” a certain type of file.\n(Commission, at p. 291.) Likewise, there is no indication the Legislature meant to\nallow public officials to shield communications about official business simply by\ndirecting them through personal accounts. Such an expedient would gut the\npublic‟s presumptive right of access (Sander v. State Bar of California, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 323), and the constitutional imperative to broadly construe this right\n(Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2)).\n       In light of these principles, and considering section 6252, subdivision (e) in\nthe context of the Act as a whole (see Smith v. Superior Court (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633518\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633518/smith-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83), we conclude a city employee‟s communications related to the conduct of\npublic business do not cease to be public records just because they were sent or\nreceived using a personal account. Sound public policy supports this result.\nB.     Policy Considerations\n       Both sides cite policy considerations to support their interpretation of the\n“public records” definition. The City argues the definition reflects a legislative\nbalance between the public‟s right of access and individual employees‟ privacy\nrights, and should be interpreted categorically. Smith counters that privacy\nconcerns are properly addressed in the case-specific application of CPRA‟s\nexemptions, not in defining the overall scope of a public record. Smith also\ncontends any privacy intrusion resulting from a search for records in personal\naccounts can be minimized through procedural safeguards. Smith has the better of\nthese arguments.\n       The City‟s interpretation would allow evasion of CPRA simply by the use\nof a personal account. We are aware of no California law requiring that public\nofficials or employees use only government accounts to conduct public business.\nIf communications sent through personal accounts were categorically excluded\nfrom CPRA, government officials could hide their most sensitive, and potentially\n\n\n                                            15\n\fdamning, discussions in such accounts. The City‟s interpretation “would not only\nput an increasing amount of information beyond the public‟s grasp but also\nencourage government officials to conduct the public‟s business in private.”\n(Senat, Whose Business Is It: Is Public Business Conducted on Officials’ Personal\nElectronic Devices Subject to State Open Records Laws? (2014) 19 Comm. L. &\nPol‟y 293, 322.)\n       It is no answer to say, as did the Court of Appeal, that we must presume\npublic officials conduct official business in the public‟s best interest. The\nConstitution neither creates nor requires such an optimistic presumption. Indeed,\nthe rationale behind the Act is that it is for the public to make that determination,\nbased on information to which it is entitled under the law. Open access to\ngovernment records is essential to verify that government officials are acting\nresponsibly and held accountable to the public they serve. (CBS, Inc. v. Block\n(1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2616084\"><a href=\"/opinion/2616084/cbs-inc-v-block/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651.) “Such access permits checks against the arbitrary\nexercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.” (Ibid.) The whole\npurpose of CPRA is to ensure transparency in government activities. If public\nofficials could evade the law simply by clicking into a different email account, or\ncommunicating through a personal device, sensitive information could routinely\nevade public scrutiny.\n       The City counters that the privacy interests of government employees\nweigh against interpreting “public records” to include material in personal\naccounts. Of course, public employees do not forfeit all rights to privacy by\nworking for the government. (Long Beach City Employees Assn. v. City of Long\nBeach (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187762\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187762/long-beach-city-employees-assn-v-city-of-long-beach/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951.) Even so, the City essentially argues that the\ncontents of personal email and other messaging accounts should be categorically\nexcluded from public review because these materials have traditionally been\nconsidered private. However, compliance with CPRA is not necessarily\ninconsistent with the privacy rights of public employees. Any personal\ninformation not related to the conduct of public business, or material falling under\n\n\n                                          16\n\fa statutory exemption, can be redacted from public records that are produced or\npresented for review. (See § 6253, subd. (a).)\n       Furthermore, a crabbed and categorical interpretation of the “public\nrecords” definition is unnecessary to protect employee privacy. Privacy concerns\ncan and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. (See International\nFederation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 329.) Beyond the definition of a public record,\nthe Act itself limits or exempts disclosure of various kinds of information,\nincluding certain types of preliminary drafts, notes, or memoranda (§ 6254,\nsubd. (a)), personal financial data (§ 6254, subd. (n)), personnel and medical files\n(§ 6254, subd. (c)), and material protected by evidentiary privileges (§ 6254,\nsubd. (k)). Finally, a catchall exemption allows agencies to withhold any record if\nthe public interest served by withholding it “clearly outweighs” the public interest\nin disclosure. (§ 6255, subd. (a).) This exemption permits a balance between the\npublic‟s interest in disclosure and the individual‟s privacy interest. (International\nFederation, at pp. 329-330; BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">742</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755-756.) The analysis here, as with other exemptions, appropriately focuses\non the content of specific records rather than their location or medium of\ncommunication. (See Commission on Peace Officer Standards, supra, 42 Cal.4th\nat p. 291.)7\n\n\n\n\n7      While admitting it invoked no CPRA exemptions in the proceedings below,\nthe City nevertheless asks us to decide that messages in employees‟ personal\naccounts are universally exempt from disclosure under section 6255. This issue\nhas not been preserved and is beyond the scope of our grant of review. It also\nappears impossible to decide on this record. Answering threshold questions about\nwhether employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy (see Hill v. National\nCollegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35), or whether their messages are\ncovered by the “deliberative process” privilege (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior\nCourt (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403959/times-mirror-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1339-1344) would require a fact-intensive review of\nthe City‟s policies and practices regarding electronic communications, if not the\ncontents of the challenged documents themselves. The record here is insufficient.\n\n\n                                         17\n\f       The City also contends the search for public records in employees‟\naccounts would itself raise privacy concerns. In order to search for responsive\ndocuments, the City claims agencies would have to demand the surrender of\nemployees‟ electronic devices and passwords to their personal accounts. Such a\nsearch would be tantamount to invading employees‟ homes and rifling through\ntheir filing cabinets, the City argues. It urges no case has extended CPRA so far.\n       Arguments that privacy interests outweigh the need for disclosure in CPRA\ncases have typically focused on the sensitive content of the documents involved,\nrather than the intrusiveness involved in searching for them. (See, e.g.,\nInternational Federation, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518991/international-federation-of-professional-and-technical-engineers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Copley Press, Inc. v.

Assuming the search for responsive documents\ncan also constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, however, this concern\nalone does not tip the policy balance in the City‟s favor. Searches can be\nconducted in a manner that respects individual privacy.\n       C.        Guidance for Conducting Searches\n       The City has not attempted to search for documents located in personal\naccounts, so the legality of a specific kind of search is not before us. However, the\nCity and some amici curiae do highlight concerns about employee privacy. Some\nguidance about how to strike the balance between privacy and disclosure may be\nof assistance.\n       CPRA requests invariably impose some burden on public agencies. Unless\na records request is overbroad or unduly burdensome, agencies are obliged to\ndisclose all records they can locate “with reasonable effort.” (California First\nAmendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166.)\nReasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake extraordinarily extensive\nor intrusive searches, however. (See American Civil Liberties Union Foundation\nv. Deukmejian (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453; Bertoli v. City of Sebastopol (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371-372.) In general, the scope of an agency‟s search for public\nrecords “need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents.”\n\n\n                                         18\n\f(American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85; see Community Youth, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.)\n       CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of searching for those\ndocuments. Agencies may develop their own internal policies for conducting\nsearches. Some general principles have emerged, however. Once an agency\nreceives a CPRA request, it must “communicate the scope of the information\nrequested to the custodians of its records,” although it need not use the precise\nlanguage of the request. (Community Youth, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 1417.)\nAs to requests seeking public records held in employees‟ nongovernmental\naccounts, an agency‟s first step should be to communicate the request to the\nemployees in question. The agency may then reasonably rely on these employees\nto search their own personal files, accounts, and devices for responsive material.\n       Federal courts applying FOIA have approved of individual employees\nconducting their own searches and segregating public records from personal\nrecords, so long as the employees have been properly trained in how to distinguish\nbetween the two. (See Ethyl Corp. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (4th\nCir. 1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"671477\"><a href=\"/opinion/671477/ethyl-corporation-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1247.) A federal employee who withholds a document\nidentified as potentially responsive may submit an affidavit providing the agency,\nand a reviewing court, “with a sufficient factual basis upon which to determine\nwhether contested items were „agency records‟ or personal materials.” (Grand\nCent. Partnership, Inc. v. Cuomo (2d Cir. 1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761233\"><a href=\"/opinion/761233/grand-central-partnership-inc-v-andrew-cuomo-as-secretary-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481.) The\nWashington Supreme Court recently adopted this procedure under its state public\nrecords law, holding that employees who withhold personal records from their\nemployer “must submit an affidavit with facts sufficient to show the information is\nnot a „public record‟ under the PRA. So long as the affidavits give the requester\nand the trial court a sufficient factual basis to determine that withheld material is\nindeed nonresponsive, the agency has performed an adequate search under the\nPRA.” (Nissen v. Pierce County (Wn. 2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57].)\nWe agree with Washington‟s high court that this procedure, when followed in\n\n\n                                          19\n\fgood faith, strikes an appropriate balance, allowing a public agency “to fulfill its\nresponsibility to search for and disclose public records without unnecessarily\ntreading on the constitutional rights of its employees.” (Id., 357 P.3d at p. 58.)\n       Further, agencies can adopt policies that will reduce the likelihood of public\nrecords being held in employees‟ private accounts. “Agencies are in the best\nposition to implement policies that fulfill their obligations” under public records\nlaws “yet also preserve the privacy rights of their employees.” (Nissen v. Pierce\nCounty, supra, 357 P.3d at p. 58.) For example, agencies might require that\nemployees use or copy their government accounts for all communications\ntouching on public business. Federal agency employees must follow such\nprocedures to ensure compliance with analogous FOIA requests. (See 44 U.S.C.\n§ 2911(a) [prohibiting use of personal electronic accounts for official business\nunless messages are copied or forwarded to an official account]; 36 C.F.R.\n§ 1236.22(b) (2016) [requiring that agencies ensure official email messages in\nemployees‟ personal accounts are preserved in the agency‟s recordkeeping\nsystem]; Landmark Legal Foundation v.

We mention these alternatives to offer guidance on remand and to\nexplain why privacy concerns do not require categorical exclusion of documents\nin personal accounts from CPRA‟s “public records” definition. If the City\nmaintains the burden of obtaining records from personal accounts is too onerous, it\nwill have an opportunity to so establish in future proceedings.
