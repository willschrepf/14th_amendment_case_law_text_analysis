Plaintiff Candido Romo was sitting in the driver’s seat\nof a parked car, intoxicated, when he was approached by defendant Officer Jeff Largen.\nLargen arrested Romo for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, assertedly based on\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 2\n\n\nLargen’s observation of Romo’s having driven the car minutes earlier. Romo contends\nthat he had not been driving. Romo filed a § 1983 suit claiming that Largen violated\nhis constitutional rights and committed several intentional torts. The district court\ndenied Largen’s qualified-immunity motion for summary judgment, finding among other\nthings that a jury could disbelieve Largen’s claim that he had previously seen a very\nsimilar car being driven in violation of traffic laws. Without such prior observation,\nLargen lacked probable cause to arrest Romo. Because this is an interlocutory appeal,\nwe are bound by the district court’s finding that a genuine dispute of material fact\nexisted as to whether Largen had observed such activity, in the absence of objectively\nincontrovertible evidence that he had. We therefore affirm the district court’s denial of\nqualified immunity on Romo’s § 1983 claim. The district court also properly permitted\nsome of Largen’s state-law claims to proceed.\n\n       On November 6, 2010, Candido Romo was supposed to meet his brother and\nbrother-in-law at a bar. However, because the bar’s parking lot was full, he left his\nvehicle, a silver Dodge Ram pickup, at a restaurant across the street. Romo and his\nbrother-in-law began drinking, while his brother served as the designated driver. They\ndrove in Romo’s brother’s truck to several bars, and Romo consumed approximately\nnine beers over the course of the night. At the end of the night, Romo’s brother left\nRomo back at his vehicle. Although it was 35 degrees outside, Romo insisted on\nspending the night in his truck, instead of staying with his relatives or being driven\nhome, because he was afraid the truck would be vandalized. To ensure that Romo would\nnot drive drunk, his brother took Romo’s keys, planning to return them in the morning\nwhen the three met up again for breakfast. Romo sat in his truck, leaned on his center\nconsole, and fell asleep.\n\n       Approximately forty-five minutes later, Romo awoke to a tapping on his window.\nBecause Romo’s car had power windows and he did not have the keys, he opened the\ndoor to see Officer Jeff Largen standing outside. Largen asked Romo what he was\ndoing, and Romo responded that he was “waiting this out.” Over the next ten minutes,\nLargen asked Romo about his night, how he was doing, and whether and how much he\n\fNo. 12-1870           Romo v. Largen                                                           Page 3\n\n\nhad been drinking. Finally, Largen asked “do you know why I pulled you over?” Romo\nresponded by stating that the officer did not pull him over because he was not driving.\nLargen asked Romo if he had passed a semi tanker by the railroad tracks, and Romo\nresponded that he had “been here for a while.” Romo also told Largen that his brother\nhad taken his keys some time before. At this point, Largen activated his microphone and\noffered to “start this conversation over” because “the more you lie to me, the more\nyou’re likely to go to jail.” Largen then continued to accuse Romo of passing a semi\ntanker at a railroad crossing and Romo repeatedly answered “I don’t know what you’re\ntalking about.”\n\n        After this line of questioning proved unfruitful, Largen asked Romo to step out\nof the truck and administered sobriety tests. Romo responded by stating again that he\nwas not driving, saying “my keys aren’t even in the trunk.”1 Largen did not respond to\nthis statement. Largen took Romo through several sobriety tests and, after Romo failed,\nLargen arrested Romo for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. They then had the\nfollowing exchange:\n\n        ROMO: . . . Why’d you pull me over?\n        OFFICER: For about the fifth time, because you passed that semi when\n        you were in the crossing area.\n        ROMO: I wasn’t driving.\n        OFFICER: Okay. That’s your story, sir. You can keep that story. My\n        story’s gonna be something different though, okay?\n        ROMO: I was sitting back there just relaxing.\n\nAfter putting Romo in his car, Largen asked if Romo wanted his wallet or his phone\nfrom the truck, and Romo declined. Largen then stated: “Okay. Do you have - - you\ndon’t have the keys on you. Are they in the vehicle?” Romo responded: “Umm, yeah.\nI’ve been sitting there for a while.”\n\n        As Largen explained why he was arresting Romo, Romo continued to protest his\ninnocence. Largen responded by telling Romo to “[s]ave it for the Judge.” Romo\n\n        1\n          Although the written transcript of the encounter uses the word “trunk,” the last word of the\nsentence is unclear on the tape and Romo more likely said “my keys aren’t even in the truck,” as Romo’s\nvehicle was a pickup truck and did not have a trunk.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                Page 4\n\n\npromised to do so and asked Largen, who had been rifling through the car, if he had\nfound the keys. Largen responded that Romo had said that he did not want the car\nlocked, and Romo stated that he had given the keys to his brother over an hour\npreviously. Largen then waved his hand over the car’s hood without touching it and said\n“I’m sure. That’s why the engine’s still warm to the touch.” Largen then drove Romo\nto the jail. All charges against Romo were later dismissed.\n\n         Largen filed a police report that described the incident. In the police report,\nLargen claimed to have seen in his rear-view mirror “a tan Dodge Ram pass a semi\ntanker in the railroad crossing no passing zone.” He stated that he “turned on the truck\nand then pulled behind it” and that the “truck had pulled into the parking lot behind Big\nT and stopped.” The police report noted that Romo had denied driving and had stated\n“I wasn’t driving my kids aren’t even in the car.” In the police report, Largen claimed\nthat he “placed [his] hand on the hood of the truck and it was warm” although since it\nwas “less than 35 degrees . . . the hood would have been cold [had Romo not recently\ndriven the truck.]” Largen would later clarify that he did not follow the Dodge Ram into\nthe Big T parking lot. Instead, he “pulled a U-turn and lost sight of it for a second,\ncouple seconds, whatever.” He then did another U-turn, to face the direction the Dodge\nwas going, but it was nowhere in sight. At that point, he decided that it likely headed\nwest down a different street, and turned down that street. It was only at that point that\nhe saw Romo’s vehicle.\n\n         Romo filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Michigan law. His complaint\nincluded federal claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution. The complaint also\nstated, without elaboration, that Largen “violated [Romo]’s right to equal protection.”\nRomo also claimed that Largen committed the intentional torts of false arrest, false\nimprisonment, and malicious prosecution. Largen claimed qualified and governmental\nimmunity and moved for summary judgment.\n\n         The district court determined that there were “at least three basic narratives\npossible from what’s going on here.” The first is that Largen fabricated the background\nstory.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                    Page 5\n\n\n        That he never really did see a truck pass a semi on the right over the\n        railroad track no matter what color it was. That he simply happened\n        upon this truck in a parking lot, seen somebody sleeping in there, and\n        then the rest unfolds into the arrest, and that he made up the whole story.\n        ...\n\nIn that case, the district court noted that “a reasonable fact-finder could conclude no\nreasonable officer, mistaken or otherwise, could conclude there’s probable cause on that.\nAnd that’s, I think, on a record like this, enough to send the case to the jury.” The\ndistrict court later noted that “a jury conceivably could discount” Largen’s story.\n\n        The second possible narrative is that Largen’s story, including the warm hood,\nis entirely correct. In that case, the district court noted that probable cause may have\nexisted. However “that’s not a story [the court] can accept for purposes of evaluating\na defense motion for summary judgment.”\n\n        The court, like the parties, spent the most time on the third possible narrative.\nIn that version of the story, Largen “ma[d]e up the part about the warm hood and the\nwarm engine, but then he really did see a Dodge truck pull alongside the semi on the\nrailroad tracks, saw it in his rear-view mirror, . . . [but] didn’t have continuous contact,\n[and] the colors [of the trucks] were different.” Id. “[E]ven if that’s the scenario,” the\ncourt determined, “summary judgment would be inappropriate.”\n\n        The district court stated that while a jury may “ultimately agree with the officer\non the defense theory, . . . it’s one of those cases that should be the jury’s call as opposed\nto my call” and denied summary judgment on the federal false-arrest claim. The court\nalso denied summary judgment on the state-law claims because they are similar, albeit\nwith a malice requirement that the court determined was fact oriented. Finally, the\ndistrict court denied summary judgment on the federal malicious-prosecution claim,\nfinding that bond conditions may be enough of an additional deprivation of liberty to\nfulfill the requirements for that claim.\n\n        Largen now appeals. He argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his\n“reasonable but mistaken belief that Romo was driving the pickup truck [he] observed\n\fNo. 12-1870            Romo v. Largen                                                               Page 6\n\n\ncommit a traffic violation.” He also argues that the state-law claims should have been\ndismissed because he acted in good faith, that the federal malicious-prosecution claim\nshould have been dismissed because the charges against Romo were dismissed, and that\nthe equal-protection claim, which was not discussed below, should be dismissed.\n\n         While the parties argue extensively about the third scenario, the district court’s\ntreatment of the first scenario is sufficient for affirmance. In adjudicating this appeal,\nwe are required by the limitations on interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity denials\nto accept the district court’s finding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to\nwhether Largen fabricated the whole or a part of his story about seeing a Dodge Ram\npickup pass a semi tanker, and we refuse to consider Largen’s factual disputations to the\ncontrary.2 In the Supreme Court’s words, “a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified\nimmunity defense, may not appeal a district court’s summary judgment order insofar as\nthat order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’ issue of\nfact for trial.” Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319–20 (1995); see also Kirby v. Duva,\n530 F.3d 475, 481 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[T]his court may simply ignore defendants’ attempts\nto dispute plaintiffs’ version of the facts, obviating the need to dismiss the entire appeal\nfor lack of jurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).3 It follows that Largen’s\nqualified-immunity defense clearly fails. No reasonable officer would believe that he\n\n         2\n           This limitation is not prudential, optional, or discretionary. It derives from the limited nature\nof our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 as interpreted in Cohen v. Beneficial\nIndustrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). The limitation is in that sense “jurisdictional.” The fact that\nat the end of this opinion we “affirm” rather than “dismiss” reflects that we are ruling on what is properly\nbefore us, and says nothing about what is jurisdictionally not before us.\n         3\n            This court may reverse, notwithstanding Johnson v. Jones, “where the trial court’s determination\nthat a fact is subject to reasonable dispute is blatantly and demonstrably false.” Moldowan v. City of\nWarren, 578 F.3d 351, 370 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Wysong v. City of Heath, 260 F. App’x 848, 853 (6th\nCir. 2008)). This principle arises from Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), which the Third Circuit\ndescribed as “the outer limit of the principle of Johnson v. Jones.” Blaylock v. City of Phil., 504 F.3d 405,\n414 (3d Cir. 2007). This court has followed the Third Circuit’s analysis. See Bishop v. Hackel,\n636 F.3d757, 769 (6th Cir. 2008); Carter v. City of Wyoming, 294 F. App’x 990, 992 (6th Cir. 2008);\nWysong, 260 F. App’x at 853. In Scott, the plaintiff’s version of the facts, which the district court\naccepted, was “so utterly discredited by the record,” which included a video of the incident, “that no\nreasonable jury could have believed him.” 550 U.S. at 380. Thus, in cases where “opposing parties tell\ntwo different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could\nbelieve it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary\njudgment.” Id. If a district court ignores this instruction and accepts the blatantly contradicted facts, “a\ncourt of appeals may say so, even on interlocutory review.” Wysong, 260 F. App’x at 853 (quoting\nBlaylock, 504 F.3d at 414). This “represents a principled way to read Johnson and Scott together and to\ncorrect the rare blatant and demonstrable error without allowing Scott to swallow Johnson.” Carter, 294\nF. App’x at 992 (internal quotation marks omitted). This exception does not apply here.\n\fNo. 12-1870           Romo v. Largen                                                             Page 7\n\n\ncould constitutionally arrest a person found sleeping in a truck and take that person to\njail for drunk driving, particularly after the person offers a cogent explanation for\nsleeping in the truck and shows that he does not even have the truck’s keys. We\ntherefore uphold the judgment of the district court denying summary judgment to Largen\non the basis of qualified immunity.\n\n         Relying on Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), and policy considerations, the\nconcurrence suggests a “reading” of Johnson under which defendants may generally\nchallenge on interlocutory appeal a district court’s determination that the summary\njudgment standard has been met with respect to factual inferences (although, in concept\nat least, not to facts that underlie such inferences). Such an approach is facially\ncontradicted by the Supreme Court’s instructions in Johnson to “take, as given, the facts\nthat the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment” and, when that is\nunclear, to “determine what facts the district court . . . likely assumed.” Johnson,\n515 U.S. at 319. The Court considered and dismissed the criticisms of this approach that\nthe concurrence raises. See id.\n\n         Thus, to accept the reading of Johnson advocated by the concurrence, we would\nhave to read Scott to have foreshadowed the overruling of Johnson’s explicit holding.4\nIt may be proper in very clear situations for a lower court to anticipate the Supreme\nCourt’s overruling of one of its precedents.5 But such instances should be limited to the\nmost compelling of inferences from intervening cases. See United States v. Koch, 383\nF.3d 436, 441-43 (6th Cir. 2004). Indeed, the Supreme Court—albeit in dictum—has\nadmonished the lower courts not readily to anticipate the overruling of its prior holdings.\nSee, e.g., Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).\nIn the words of Learned Hand, it is not “desirable for a lower court to embrace the\n\n         4\n           We do not mean to suggest that the concurrence is advocating that we disregard Johnson in\nanticipation of its being overruled.\n         5\n           The Fourth Circuit in 1955, for instance, extended the Supreme Court’s rejection of the\nconstitutional separate-but-equal doctrine to public transportation cases—notwithstanding Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), a separate-but-equal public transportation case—based on the Supreme\nCourt’s then-recent rejection of the separate-but-equal doctrine in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), which was decided in the distinct context of school desegregation. See Flemming v. S.C. Elec.\n& Gas Co., 224 F.2d 752 (4th Cir. 1955).\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 8\n\n\nexhilarating opportunity of anticipating a doctrine which may be in the womb of time,\nbut whose birth is distant.” Spector Motor Serv. v Walsh, 139 F.2d 809, 823 (L. Hand,\nJ., dissenting) (2d Cir. 1943), vacated sub nom. Spector Motor Serv. v. McLaughlin, 323\nU.S. 101 (1944). The instant appeal hardly presents a situation in which to disregard\nsuch admonitions. The Scott opinion did not even mention the Johnson holding, and\nScott is easily limited as an exception for blatantly contradicted facts. It is up to the\nSupreme Court to overrule Johnson, and Scott does not provide us a basis for\nanticipating—much less predicting with compelling confidence—that the Supreme Court\nwill do so.\n\n       We next consider Largen’s appeal of the denial of governmental immunity on\nRomo’s state-law claims. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Romo, Largen\ndid not have probable cause to arrest Romo for operating while intoxicated and a jury\ncould find that Largen acted with malice.         The district court properly denied\ngovernmental immunity to Largen. Largen did not have any evidence that Romo was\noperating the truck. Largen found Romo intoxicated and sleeping in his truck. Since\npeople rarely sit in their vehicles without driving them, Largen could reasonably suspect\nthat Romo either had driven or was planning to drive while intoxicated. However,\nRomo’s responses to Largen’s questioning should have dispelled those suspicions.\nRomo explained that he was sleeping off a night of drinking, that he had not been\ndriving, and that he could not drive because he did not have the keys. Although Largen\nclaims that he heard Romo say that his kids, rather than his keys, were in the truck, he\nlater states “you don’t have the keys on you,” suggesting that he had heard Romo say he\ndid not have the keys at some point during the conversation. Romo also stated in his\ndeposition that he told Largen that his brother had taken his keys before Largen even\nturned on the microphone. Romo had a reasonable explanation and Largen had no\ninculpatory evidence.\n\n       Drunk driving is a serious danger to the public, and police are properly\nsuspicious of anyone sitting in his car drunk. However, they need more than presence\nin the driver’s seat of a vehicle for probable cause. For example, in Nettles-Nickerson\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                    Page 9\n\n\nv. Free, the plaintiff had started her car, her brake lights had turned on, and she sat in it\nwhile it was running. 687 F.3d 288, 291 (6th Cir. 2012). This court determined that in\nsuch a situation, a police officer can reasonably believe that the plaintiff was operating\nthe car. The court noted that “nothing impeded Nettles-Nickerson’s ability to move the\ncar” and that she was “able, at any moment, to drive away.” Id. at 291–92. In contrast,\nRomo could not possibly drive anywhere because he did not have the keys. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals has found that a person operates a car once it is put into gear.\nSee City of Plymouth v. Longeway, 818 N.W.2d 419, 424 (Mich. Ct. App. 2012).\nHowever, if the car is in “park” or not even running, and the person is asleep, then he is\nnot operating the car. See Michigan v. Burton, 651 N.W.2d 143, 151 (Mich. Ct. App.\n2002); Michigan v. Andres, No. 258280, 2006 WL 448811 at *5 (Mich. Ct. App. Feb.\n23, 2006). The only exception is if there is evidence that the person had driven the car\nwhile intoxicated to the location where the officers found it. See Michigan v. Stephen,\n685 N.W.2d 309, 313 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004). However, Largen had no evidence that\nRomo had driven the car to the parking lot after drinking, and Romo explained that his\nbrother had driven him there and took his keys so that he could not drive.\n\n        To be entitled to governmental immunity under Michigan law, a lower-level\ngovernment official accused of an intentional tort must show that:\n\n                (a) The acts were undertaken during the course of employment\n        and the employee was acting, or reasonably believed that he was acting,\n        within the scope of his authority,\n                (b) the acts were undertaken in good faith, or were not undertaken\n        with malice, and\n                (c) the acts were discretionary, as opposed to ministerial.\n\nOdom v. Wayne County, 760 N.W.2d 217, 228 (Mich. 2008). The only question here is\nwhether Largen was acting in good faith or with malice. A police officer is entitled to\ngovernmental immunity “if he acted in good faith and honestly believed that he had\nprobable cause to arrest, even if he later learned that he was mistaken.” Id. at 229. This\ntest is subjective, not objective. Id. Largen argues that since the district court stated that\n“the officer sounds like he believes what he’s talking about,” he is entitled to\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                               Page 10\n\n\ngovernmental immunity. However, the court also found that “a reasonable fact-finder\ncould still draw an inference of actual malice.” Moreover, if Largen lied on his police\nreport and to the prosecutor in order to obtain a prosecution of Romo, that is strong\nevidence of malice. Accordingly, Largen is not entitled to governmental immunity on\nRomo’s state-law claims.\n\n       On the other hand, Largen is entitled to summary judgment on Romo’s federal\nmalicious-prosecution and equal protection claims because Romo has stated that he is\nno longer pursuing these claims. See Romo Br. at 38–39.\n\n       The district court’s denial of qualified immunity with respect to Romo’s federal\nmalicious-prosecution claim is reversed. The judgment of the district court is otherwise\naffirmed.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                   Page 11\n\n\n            __________________________________________________\n\n              CONCURRING IN PART AND IN THE JUDGMENT\n            __________________________________________________\n\n        SUTTON, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. One aspect of\nthis case is easy: deciding whether Romo’s false-arrest claim should go to a jury. Once\nwe give Romo’s testimony all of the inferences to which it is entitled at summary\njudgment, it is clear that a reasonable jury could grant him relief on this claim. Another\naspect of this case is not: deciding how to apply Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995),\nand deciding whether we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. The majority\noffers one way of applying Johnson to this appeal. I write separately to offer another\nway of looking at it.\n\n        In Johnson, Houston Jones filed an excessive force claim against five policemen\nwho allegedly beat him. Three of the officers moved for summary judgment. Their\nargument? “We didn’t do it,” an argument supported by the three officers’ affidavits but\nin tension with Jones’s evidence-supported arguments. In a quintessential application\nof Civil Rule 56, the district court held that the jury should resolve this material fact\ndispute. The officers filed an appeal, insisting once more that they didn’t do it. “When\nasked at oral argument if they could lose the factual dispute and still prevail, defendants’\nlawyer answered no.” Jones v. Johnson, 26 F.3d 727, 728 (7th Cir. 1994). In a 6-\nparagraph per curiam opinion, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction on the ground that “defendants may urge only legal issues on [interlocutory]\nappeals.” Id. at 727.\n\n        The Supreme Court followed the Seventh Circuit’s approach and elaborated on\nit. In the normal course, the Court explained, a denial of summary judgment is not final,\nand appellate courts must wait for a district court to issue a final order before reviewing\nthe case. 515 U.S. at 309. That patience saves appellate resources, prevents delay and\nkeeps pretrial matters where they belong—with the district court. Id. at 317. But\nqualified immunity is not a typical summary judgment defense; it is an immunity from\nstanding trial. Forcing an official who loses in the district court to wait for a jury verdict\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                  Page 12\n\n\nbefore appellate review would defeat an essential component of the defense. See id. at\n315–17. The prospect of interlocutory qualified immunity appeals in this area thus pits\nthe desire to protect government employees from needless trials against the fear of\nclogging appellate dockets with delay-creating and essentially frivolous appeals.\n\n        In a unanimous decision, Johnson tried to resolve that tension. A defendant may\nimmediately appeal a denial of qualified immunity “to the extent that it turns on an issue\nof law,” such as whether the defendant violated a clearly established constitutional right.\nId. at 313 (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985)). But defendants who\nmerely want to argue evidentiary sufficiency have to wait until after trial. Id. District\ncourts have more experience sifting through convoluted factual records, the Court\nexplained, and asking the courts of appeals to take a second look at discovery documents\nrisks unduly postponing a plaintiff’s day in court. Id. at 316. And all of that time would\nbe wasted if, after affirming, the jury finds in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant\nappeals yet again. Id. at 316–17. In view of these concerns and others, Johnson told\nappellate courts to limit their interlocutory resources to questions of law.\n\n        Keeping in mind that courts do not read judicial opinions like statutes, I submit\nthat there are two ways to read Johnson. One applies it only to prototypical “he said, she\nsaid” fact disputes, in which the defendants (usually government employees) refuse to\naccept the truth of what the plaintiffs (usually individual claimants) say happened.\nWhen the appeal boils down to dueling accounts of what happened and when the\ndefendants insist on acknowledging on appeal only their accounts, the underlying basis\nfor an interlocutory appeal disappears.\n\n        The other applies the decision not just to whether the defendant officers accept\nthe plaintiff’s evidence-supported version of what happened but also to whether the\ndefendants accept the district court’s reading of the inferences from those facts: here,\nwhether Officer Largen lied about seeing a Dodge Ram on the road. Under that view\n(and the majority’s view), when a district court determines that there is a “genuine issue\nof fact” for trial by drawing an inference in favor of the plaintiff, the appellate court may\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                  Page 13\n\n\nnot second-guess that inference, indeed lacks jurisdiction to do so. I favor the former\nreading.\n\n        First, my proposed reading respects Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), which\npost-dates Johnson. In Scott, Deputy Timothy Scott followed Victor Harris in a high-\nspeed chase. Worried that Harris’s reckless driving posed a threat to the public, Scott\nran Harris off the road, which caused a crash, which left Harris a quadriplegic. Harris\nsued, alleging excessive force, and the parties introduced a videotape of the chase at\nsummary judgment. According to the district court, reasonable minds could disagree\nabout whether Harris posed a real risk, creating a fact issue for the jury. It wrote: “A\nrational fact finder could find that a reasonable officer would not have believed that\nbecause of his traffic offense, Harris posed an immediate threat to the safety of\nothers. . . . Harris did not use his vehicle in an aggressive manner. . . . A jury could also\nfind that Scott’s use of force—ramming the car while traveling at high speeds—was not\nin proportion to the risk that Harris posed, and therefore was objectively unreasonable.”\nHarris v. Coweta Cnty., Ga., No. CIVA 3:01CV 148 WBH, 2003 WL 25419527, at *5\n(N.D. Ga. Sept. 25, 2003). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on the merits and rejected the\n“argument that we are without jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.” Harris v.\nCoweta Cnty., Ga., 433 F.3d 807, 811 n.3 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n        The Supreme Court reversed on the merits. “At the summary judgment stage,”\nit started, “facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only\nif there is a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.” 550 U.S. at 380 (quoting Civil Rule\n56(c)). Harris’s account—that he remained relatively in control—was “blatantly\ncontradicted by the record,” namely the videotape, which showed him driving\n“shockingly fast,” “swerv[ing]” and “forc[ing] cars . . . to their respective shoulders to\navoid being hit.” Id. at 379–80. “[N]o reasonable jury could have believed” Harris’s\n“version of events,” and, the Court held, neither the district court nor the Eleventh\nCircuit should have accepted his version either. Id. at 380.\n\n        The details of Harris’s driving were not in dispute; the video laid those to rest.\nWhat mattered were the inferences those details could support: Was Harris driving\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 14\n\n\nsafely? Those inferences, Scott illustrates, remain subject to interlocutory review. A\ncontrary reading of Johnson—that in no event does an appellate court have jurisdiction\nto say a district court drew the wrong inferences—cannot co-exist with Scott. This\nreading of Scott also respects Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299 (1996), which cautions\nthat “[d]enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are\ncontroverted issues of material fact, and Johnson surely does not mean that every such\ndenial of summary judgment is nonappealable.” Id. at 842.\n\n       Second, the only way to avoid this reading of the holdings of Johnson and Scott\nis to create distinctions that are not driven by meaningful differences or that would be\ndifficult to implement in practice. One might for example limit Scott to videos (and\naudio recordings), reasoning that appellate courts need not defer to the eyes (or ears) of\ndistrict courts when the relevant evidence comes in the form of a video or audio of the\nencounter as opposed to dueling eyewitness accounts of the encounter disclosed in\ndepositions. But one need not be an expert in the senses to appreciate that the capacity\nof appellate judges to identify untenable inferences in a district court’s assessment of a\nvideo and an audio depiction of an event may apply just as often to their capacity to see\nuntenable inferences in a district court’s assessment of a deposition transcript. In both\ncases, the district and appellate court judges are looking at the same thing.\n\n       Or one could say, as today’s majority does, that Scott trumps Johnson only when\nthe district court’s assessment of the inferences to draw is “blatantly contradicted by the\nrecord.” Scott, 550 U.S. at 380. Only if the district court was really wrong would we\nthus have authority to review the district court’s reading of the inferences. But the most\nstraightforward way to say that a district court did not make such a mistake is to say that\na reasonable jury could rule for the plaintiff on that record. That is the traditional\nquestion we consider in reviewing qualified-immunity interlocutory appeals. If Johnson\nis designed to protect appellate courts from record review, how does a “blatantly\ncontradicted by the record” standard help? It does not allow us to ignore depositions and\ndocuments we would otherwise read, as those same items will be the source of any such\nclear-error argument. That explains why the majority in this case must review that same\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 15\n\n\nsort of record evidence here—to assure itself that the district court did not blatantly\ncontradict the record. See Maj. Op. at 6–7 n.3. A defendant making a Scott claim and\na defendant raising a de novo challenge to the lower court’s inferences are asking us to\ndo much the same thing. Even if it turns out to be only the occasional case that meets\nthe Scott standard, I doubt it will be only the occasional lawyer who argues that the\ndistrict court badly misread the record. This reading of Johnson thus trades a long-\nestablished direct approach to qualified-immunity appeals for a complicated indirect\napproach that ultimately returns to the same question (or something very close to it).\nAnd this reading implies that we have jurisdiction to reverse badly drawn inferences but\nno jurisdiction to affirm less than badly drawn inferences—a new and strange version\nof appellate power. What, in short, has been gained?\n\n       Third, much may be lost with a broad interpretation of Johnson, as it implicates\na jurisdictional inquiry that raises the stakes and complexities of the debate. Johnson\nsays that a defendant who loses a qualified immunity motion “may not appeal a district\ncourt’s summary judgment order,” and that the court of appeals lacks “jurisdiction” over\nsuch an appeal, “insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets\nforth a ‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial.” 515 U.S. at 309, 319–20. Since Johnson, it is\ntrue, the Court “has endeavored . . . to bring some discipline to the use of the term\n‘jurisdictional.’” Gonzalez v. Thaler, 132 S. Ct. 641, 648 (2012) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 510 (2006). But it is\ndifficult to see how Johnson does not implicate core subject matter jurisdiction.\nCongress has granted courts of appeals “jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions\nof the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. That speaks to subject matter jurisdiction. See\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 215 (2007). In Cohen v. Beneficial Industries Loan\nCorp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), the Court construed § 1291 to give appellate courts\njurisdiction over some interlocutory—non-final—decisions. That too speaks to subject\nmatter jurisdiction. See Mohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106, 114 (2009).\nAnd Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985), construed Cohen to give appellate\ncourts jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from a district court’s denial of a motion\nfor qualified immunity. That too speaks to subject matter jurisdiction. See Mohawk\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 16\n\n\nIndus., 558 U.S. at 106. It follows that Johnson raises an unyielding jurisdictional\ninquiry, one that the courts of appeals must raise whether they like it or not, whether the\nparties have raised it or not.\n\n        That is a tall order if courts embrace a broad interpretation of Johnson. It is\ndifficult to think of qualified immunity appeals that do not involve inference drawing by\nthe district courts, whether implied or explicit. And there are few days of oral argument\nin the life of an appellate judge that do not involve at least one qualified immunity\ninterlocutory appeal. This case is a good example of the task that awaits us. Neither\nparty mentioned Johnson in its briefs. All that appears in the plaintiff’s brief on this\nscore is this stand-alone sentence: “In fact, given that the court ruled that these\ncredibility disputes created a factual issue regarding what actually happened that must\nbe determined by a jury, which directly affects the evidence allegedly supporting\nprobable cause, this should not even be an issue that is subject to an appeal. Gregory v.\nCity of Louisville, 744 [sic] F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2006).” App’ee Br. at 30. If we followed\nthe normal rules for identifying error, we would say that the plaintiff forfeited any\nJohnson argument. The argument is not identified (or embedded) in the issues presented\non appeal, it is undeveloped, and it leaves the reader guessing what the appellee means\nto argue. See Johns v. Holder, 678 F.3d 404, 408–09 (6th Cir. 2012). To its credit, the\nmajority nonetheless takes on the Johnson issue, as indeed it must if it implicates our\njurisdiction. In view of the underlying interpretation of § 1291 implicated by all\ninterlocutory appeals and in view of the prohibition on “hypothetical” jurisdiction, Steel\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998), that is the only path available\nto us. Yet the majority’s approach pulls jurisdiction into many, if not most, qualified\nimmunity appeals, whereas my interpretation of Johnson—confining it to “I didn’t do\nit” appeals—will create few jurisdictional disputes.\n\n        Fourth, a broad interpretation of Johnson not only requires us to police subject\nmatter jurisdiction in a great many cases, but it also requires us to do so by reviewing the\nrecord in new and unusual ways. At first glance, the reader might think that separating\nauthority to review law-based appeals from authority to review fact-based appeals is\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 17\n\n\neasy. It is not. Yes, a qualified-immunity appeal based solely on what the Constitution\nmeans or whether an interpretation of it was clearly established at a given point in time\nraises purely legal issues. But the classic summary judgment question—could a\nreasonable jury rule for the plaintiff on this record as construed in his favor?—also raises\na “legal” question, even though it is intertwined with the facts, which is why appellate\ncourts traditionally give fresh review to district court decisions in this area. Milligan v.\nUnited States, 670 F.3d 686, 696 (6th Cir. 2012). The rub is that Johnson appears to\ndivide this last category into appealable and non-appealable decisions. I would construe\nthe decision as applying only when the defendant refuses to accept the truth of the\nplaintiff’s evidence at summary judgment by maintaining for example that he didn’t do\nit when the plaintiff produces evidence that he did. The majority would construe the\ndecision as applying whenever the defendant challenges the inferences drawn by the\ndistrict court in denying the summary judgment motion.\n\n        The majority’s approach creates two unpalatable options when it comes to\nreviewing summary judgment decisions. The first is to comb the record to figure out the\ninferences that the district court likely drew, then to defer to those assumed inferences.\nJohnson, 515 U.S. at 319. If those inferences create a genuine issue of material fact, no\njurisdiction exists. The other option is to defer only to the inferences the district court\nactually drew on the record, see, e.g., Lewis v. Tripp, 604 F.3d 1221, 1226 (10th Cir.\n2010), and no jurisdiction exists if those inferences create a genuine issue of material\nfact. While the latter approach has the virtue of being real rather than imagined, it\ncreates problems of its own. In my experience, district court judges generally do not\nwrite summary judgment opinions in this way. Take this decision, which the judge\ndelivered orally, presumably because he placed a (legitimate) premium on resolving this\nsummary judgment motion promptly. The district court explained why the plaintiff\ncould win based on the court’s reading of the record, intermingling verbatim statements\nfrom the various depositions, paraphrases from those depositions and inferences from\nthe depositions. That is not unusual. I indeed have not come across trial judges who\ndistinguish between facts and inferences or who explain the difference material fact by\nmaterial fact. That perhaps is because Johnson speaks to what appellate judges should\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 18\n\n\ndo, not to what district court judges should do, and I doubt the point of Johnson was to\npile new tasks onto trial judges’ work loads or to tell them how to do their jobs. Much\nsimpler, I think, to let appellate courts do what they long have done by taking a fresh\nlook at the traditional (non-jurisdictional) summary judgment question: After giving the\nnon-movant (usually the plaintiff) the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the\nrecord, does the case create a material triable issue of fact?\n\n        Fifth, efforts to work around these problems will create problems of their own.\nCourts for example might construe Johnson as giving appellate judges the option of\ndismissing appeals for lack of jurisdiction. Consistent with this approach, one court has\ncalled the Johnson inquiry a “prudential” one, M.M.R.-Z. v. Puerto Rico, 528 F.3d 9, 13\n(1st Cir. 2008). From what I can tell, that seems to be the approach the majority has\ntaken. After engaging in the Johnson inquiry and after noting that the appellant (Officer\nLargen) has failed to accept the district court’s inferences from the record, the court\nnonetheless “affirm[s]” and “uphold[s]” the district court’s decision rather than\ndismissing this part of it for lack of jurisdiction. Maj. Op. at 7, 10. The majority insists\nthat Johnson remains a jurisdictional rule in our circuit, but offers an explanation for its\njudgment with which I am unfamiliar: “The fact that at the end of this opinion we\n‘affirm’ rather than ‘dismiss’ reflects that we are ruling on what is properly before us,\nand says nothing about what is jurisdictionally not before us.” Id. at 6 n.2. As shown,\nCohen and Mitchell (and thus Johnson as well) interpret § 1291, which makes any\napplication of those decisions (whether narrowing or broadening) jurisdictional. The\nbaseline norm at any rate is that courts should resolve all disputes—including\nappeals—that Congress authorizes them to resolve. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264,\n404 (1821). We should not lightly create exceptions to that “unflagging” obligation.\nDeakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.S. 193, 203 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis cure, in short, seems worse than the disease.\n\n        Johnson itself acknowledged another way around these knotty issues, though it\nis not one the Court seemed to endorse. It “assum[ed], for the sake of argument, that it\nmay sometimes be appropriate to exercise ‘pendent appellate jurisdiction’ over” a\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 19\n\n\ndistrict court’s genuine-issue-of-material-fact decision. 515 U.S. at 318 (citing Swint v.\nChambers Cnty. Comm’n, 514 U.S. 35, 50–51 (1995)). An appeal that raised purely\nlegal questions under prong one of the qualified immunity inquiry (what does the\nConstitution mean in this setting?) or prong two (was the right clearly established when\nthe officers acted?) thus would create appellate jurisdiction over these issues and pendent\nappellate jurisdiction over any other issues raised by the district court’s decision. After\nacknowledging this possibility, Johnson said it was “unlikely that Courts of Appeals”\nwould exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction “where the appealable issue appears\nsimply a means to lead the court to review the underlying factual matter.” Id. Fair\nenough.\n\n        But in our circuit and, best I can tell, in most circuits, the test for pendent\nappellate jurisdiction—whether the two issues are “inextricably intertwined,” Chambers\nv. Ohio Dep’t of Human Servs., 145 F.3d 793, 797 (6th Cir. 1998) (citing Swint, 514 U.S.\nat 49–50)—will not be demanding in the context of a qualified immunity appeal and thus\nwill not require gamesmanship to put all issues in front of the appellate court. Will it not\nusually be the case, at prong one of the qualified immunity inquiry, that the meaning of\nthe Constitution and the underlying facts are inextricably intertwined? How could they\nnot be? They often implicate “mixed questions of law and fact,” Williams v. Mehra, 186\nF.3d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc), the epitome of inextricably intertwined law and\nfact issues. They are called mixed, as opposed to segregated, questions of law and fact\nfor a reason. And even when that is not the case, how does one decide what the\nConstitution means without regard to the facts? So too with the clearly established\ninquiry, one that looks at whether the officers should have known that their fact pattern\ndid not permit them to act the way they did under then-existing law. Keep in mind,\nmoreover, that the question is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. Even if\nthe genuine-issue question somehow is purely factual in nature, the issue of materiality\nis not. Which facts are material to a constitutional claim will always be a legal question,\nintertwining the genuine-issue fact question and the constitutional standard implicated\nby the plaintiff’s claim. Cf. Livermore v. Lubelan, 476 F.3d 397, 407 (6th Cir. 2007).\nRather than engage in debates about this or that path to pendent appellate jurisdiction in\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                   Page 20\n\n\ntoday’s case, I would affirm on the traditional ground that, once the officer accepts the\ntruth of the plaintiff’s evidence-supported factual allegations, his appeal fails to rebut the\nargument that a reasonable jury could rule against him on this record.\n\n        Why, moreover, should the officer willing to concede the truth of the plaintiff’s\nevidence-supported version of the facts not get interlocutory review over the district\ncourt’s genuine-issue-of-fact determination (itself a legal question), but the officer who\nchallenges that and the district court’s understanding of the meaning of the Constitution\ngets interlocutory review? If the difference turns on efficiency, that is an unusual\nexplanation for a court-made jurisdictional rule and at all events not necessarily true.\nThe capacity of district courts and appellate courts to identify triable issues of material\nfact based on the review of paper records strikes me as about equal—and as being done\nby both just as frequently. And while interlocutory review delays a potential trial, the\nappeal will potentially avoid unnecessary constitutional rulings, see Pearson v.\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 237 (2009), end the case (if the officer wins), often prompt a\nsettlement (if the officer loses) or often eliminate a later appeal (if the officer loses the\nappeal and the jury trial). As to this last point, while the summary judgment record and\nthe jury record often will differ, they normally will differ in ways that make it more\ndifficult for an officer to win on appeal, as the appellate court will be asked to second\nguess not just inferences that could be drawn from a paper record but inferences that may\nbe drawn from eyeballing the witnesses as well. In the end, if the district court is wrong\nabout permissible fact inferences at summary judgment, even if not “blatantly” wrong,\nI do not understand why we should force these officers to undertake a trial.\n\n        Sixth, a broad reading of Johnson is in tension with related principles of qualified\nimmunity, jurisdiction and judicial administration. The courts are reluctant to make\nappealability decisions in this area turn on the novelties of individual cases as opposed\nto principles that cut across groups of traditional appeals. “Making appealability depend\nupon . . . factor[s] particular to the case at hand[] would violate the principle . . . that\nappealability determinations are made for classes of decisions not individual orders in\nspecific cases.” Behrens, 516 U.S. at 312. By making jurisdiction turn on the facts in\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 21\n\n\nevery case, every case will become a class of an appealable or a non-appealable decision\nunto itself. For related reasons, courts strive to separate jurisdictional inquiries from\nmerits-driven ones, Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 510–11; see also Chafin v. Chafin, 133 S. Ct.\n1017, 1024 (2013); Primax Recoveries, Inc. v. Gunter, 433 F.3d 515, 519 (6th Cir.\n2006), an objective thoroughly undermined by a broad reading of Johnson.\n\n        Pearson v. Callahan suggests another way of looking at this problem. That case\noverruled Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001), which required courts to resolve prong\none (the current meaning of the Constitution) of a qualified immunity defense before\nmoving to prong two (the clearly established meaning of the Constitution at the time of\nthe incident). One of the problems with that “rigid order of battle,” Pearson, 555 U.S.\nat 234, was the frequency with which courts ignored it. Saucier was mandatory—but\nnot when the case was overly factbound, id. at 237, or when the Supreme Court granted\ncertiorari on a related issue, id. at 238, or when state law came into play, id. These\nexceptions undermined, not proved, the rule, and any rule ought not to be honored in the\nbreach. A broad reading of Johnson, I fear, raises similar problems. It forbids record\nreview—but not when the district court made a blatant error or when the district court\nwas not explicit or when intent or mixed questions of law and fact come into play or\nwhen pendent appellate jurisdiction is exercised.\n\n        The majority’s reading of Johnson also creates tension with Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662 (2009), which requires courts to determine whether the inferences a\nplaintiff wants a jury to draw are “plausible.” Id. at 678. No doubt, it may be easier for\nappellate courts to draw reasonable inferences from complaints than from summary\njudgment records. But how strange to think that the distinction is jurisdictional—that\na court of appeals has jurisdiction to overturn a district court’s reading of the inferences\nat the motion to dismiss stage but not at the summary judgment stage—a theory that may\nhave the incidental (and unintended) effect of encouraging defendants to file appeals at\neach stage.\n\n        Seventh, a broad reading of Johnson creates other oddities with respect to mixed\nquestions of law and fact and questions of intent, which frequently come up in qualified\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 22\n\n\nimmunity appeals.      Some issues, such as the presence (or absence) of exigent\ncircumstances or the exculpatory (or not) nature of evidence, go to a jury. Ewolski v.\nCity of Brunswick, 287 F.3d 492, 501 (6th Cir. 2002); Gregory v. City of Louisville, 444\nF.3d 725, 744 (6th Cir. 2006). Other issues, such as the existence of probable cause or\ndeliberate indifference, may or may not go to a jury under our case law. See McKenna\nv. Edgell, 617 F.3d 432, 441 (6th Cir. 2010); id. at 447–50 (Rogers, J., dissenting).\nCompare Williams, 186 F.3d at 689; with Phillips v. Roane Cnty., 534 F.3d 531, 539 (6th\nCir. 2008). And issues of intent will often require courts to draw inferences. If a district\ncourt says reasonable minds could differ on one of these questions, say exigent\ncircumstances, does that tie our hands and remove any jurisdiction over the appeal, even\nwhen the underlying facts are undisputed? See Dixon v. Donald, 291 F. App’x 759, 762\n(6th Cir. 2008) (“To the extent that Donald is arguing the existence of exigent\ncircumstances . . . he is raising genuine issues of material fact that Johnson prohibits us\nfrom reviewing.”); Elliott v. Leavitt, 105 F.3d 174, 175 (4th Cir. 1997) (Wilkinson, J.,\nconcurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (noting that, under a broad reading of\nJohnson, “[a]ll plaintiffs need do to receive an automatic trial is simply assert, without\nany evidence, that ‘the police are lying’”). If so, how does that interpretation advance\nthe efficiency concerns of Johnson? One would have thought that an earlier, rather than\na later, appellate ruling on the meaning of law in an accepted setting of facts would help\neveryone, the parties and the district court included.\n\n        A broad reading of Johnson requires appellate courts to separate (unreviewable)\nfactual inferences from (reviewable) legal conclusions. This assignment calls to mind\nthe ill-starred distinction nineteenth century pleading rules drew between ultimate facts\n(which plaintiffs could, indeed had to, plead) and conclusions of law (which they could\nnot). See Charles E. Clark, The Complaint in Code Pleading, 35 Yale L. J. 259, 259–60\n(1926). An example illustrates the perplexities that await. Suppose that a district court\nfaced with an exigent circumstances case concludes that the plaintiff’s behavior did not\nmanifest a risk of “imminent destruction of evidence.” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.S.\n398, 403 (2006). Has the court drawn a factual inference from the plaintiff’s behavior?\nOr has it reached a legal conclusion about the applicability of a particular justification\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 23\n\n\nfor a warrantless search? Whatever the answer, does it make sense to hinge jurisdiction\non such a will-o’-the-wisp distinction?\n\n       Eighth, all of these distinctions and complexities increase the odds that appellate\njurisdiction will turn on the quality of the lawyer a party happens to hire. It is the rare\nqualified-immunity appeal that does not implicate the meaning of the Constitution, and\nit is the rare capable attorney who thus cannot frame an appeal that invokes that core\nappellate jurisdiction. What happens as a result is that lawyers schooled in Johnson\nknow how to avoid its shoals (by raising a colorable legal question, which is not a high\nbar, see Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89) and lawyers unschooled in Johnson unwittingly\napproach its shoals, requiring appellate courts to resolve a difficult, sometimes\nexcruciating, jurisdictional question, made more difficult by the flexible opt-in of\npendent appellate jurisdiction, instead of simply affirming on the merits because the\nplaintiff’s claim implicates a triable issue of material fact. This case could have been\nresolved by a three-page summary order to that exact effect. Once the officers\nacknowledged that they had to accept the reasonable inferences from plaintiffs’ record-\nsupported evidence, as their attorney did at oral argument, appellate jurisdiction existed,\nand we could have affirmed on that basis then and there.\n\n       On a related score, it is not unusual for lawyers to pay tribute to Johnson,\nsuggesting they are willing to accept the plaintiff’s version of the facts or the district\ncourt’s inferences from those facts but nonetheless shading the recitation of those facts\nin their client’s favor, whether at the briefing stage or at oral argument. See Estate of\nCarter v. City of Detroit, 408 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir. 2005) (“[T]his court can ignore the\ndefendant’s attempts to dispute the facts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue,\nobviating the need to dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction.”). Lawyers will\nbe lawyers when it comes to this kind of thing, not because there is anything wrong with\nthem but because it is human nature to shade facts and inferences in favor of the\nadvocate’s position. We ought to be wary of a rule for processing a high percentage of\nappeals that is a trap for some and easy to evade for others—and that requires a degree\nof restraint that is difficult for most lawyers, indeed most human beings, to muster.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                  Page 24\n\n\nLittle is gained, and much is lost, and the difference from the party’s perspective often\nwill turn on nothing more than the acumen of the attorney he can afford to hire.\n\n        The option of pendent appellate jurisdiction and the ease with which most\nlawyers can avoid Johnson jurisdictional problems might suggest that I should not be\ntroubled by the majority’s reading of it. That may be true in one sense. If ingenuity is\na key that invariably unlocks the gateway to appellate jurisdiction, that is no less true for\njudges than for lawyers. But it does not flatter a legal rule that it is so often implicated\nand so easily avoided, particularly when it goes to jurisdiction.\n\n        Nor does it seem helpful that, nearly twenty years after Johnson, every circuit in\nthe country has some decisions that adopt my reading of it and some that adopt the\nmajority’s. Start with our circuit. Some support the majority’s view. See Morrison v.\nBd. of Trs. of Green Twp., 583 F.3d 394, 404 (6th Cir. 2009); Phillips v. Roane Cnty.,\n534 F.3d 531, 538 (6th Cir. 2008); Johnson v. Karnes, 398 F.3d 868, 876 (6th Cir. 2003).\nOthers support my view or variations on it. See Chappell v. City of Cleveland, 585 F.3d\n901, 906 (6th Cir. 2009) (stating that a court of appeals can consider “legal errors as to\nwhether the factual disputes (a) are genuine and (b) concern material facts”); see also\nBishop v. Hackel, 636 F.3d 757, 769 (6th Cir. 2011); Leary v. Livingston Cnty., 528 F.3d\n438, 441–42 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n        The Seventh Circuit, affirmed in Johnson, seems to adopt a narrow interpretation\nof Johnson. See Anderson v. Cornejo, 355 F.3d 1021, 1023 (7th Cir. 2004). But that is\nnot always the case. See Sain v. Wood, 512 F.3d 886, 891 (7th Cir. 2008). In every\nother circuit, save possibly for the D.C. and Federal Circuits, there are opinions\nsupporting my view or otherwise involving appellate court review of inferences on the\nmerits. See Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1998); Salim v. Proulx, 93\nF.3d 86, 89–90 (2d Cir. 1996); Schieber v. City of Philadelphia, 320 F.3d 409, 420 (3d\nCir. 2003); Winfield v. Bass, 106 F.3d 525, 533 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc); Brown v.\nCallahan, 623 F.3d 249, 254–55 (5th Cir. 2010); Nelson v. Shuffman, 603 F.3d 439, 451\n(8th Cir. 2010); Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895, 907–10 (9th Cir. 2001); Lewis v. Tripp,\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                Page 25\n\n\n604 F.3d 1221, 1226–28 (10th Cir. 2010); Morton v. Kirkwood, 707 F.3d 1276, 1284\n(11th Cir. 2013).\n\n       That would be a powerful point in my favor if not for the reality that there are\nalso decisions in every other circuit, save for the D.C. and Federal Circuits, that suggest\nthe opposite. See Diaz v. Martinez, 112 F.3d 1, 4–5 (1st Cir. 1997); Locurto v. Safir, 264\nF.3d 154, 167 (2d Cir. 2001); Ziccardi v. City of Philadelphia, 288 F.3d 57, 61–62 (3d\nCir. 2002); Culosi v. Bullock, 596 F.3d 195, 201–02 (4th Cir. 2010); Smith v. Brenoettsy,\n158 F.3d 908, 913 (5th Cir. 1998); Parks v. Pomeroy, 387 F.3d 949, 956 (8th Cir. 2004);\nChateaubriand v. Gaspard, 97 F.3d 1218, 1223 (9th Cir. 1996); Fogarty v. Gallegos,\n523 F.3d 1147, 1154 (10th Cir. 2008); Ratliff v. DeKalb Cnty., 62 F.3d 338, 341 (11th\nCir. 1995). In view of these intra-circuit conflicts, it should not go unmentioned that\nadditional litigation over appealability, an inevitable outcome of any uncertainty over\nthe scope of it, adds to appellate work loads: one hundred and eighty degrees away from\nJohnson’s goal. I would resolve that problem and the others mentioned above by\nadopting a narrow interpretation of Johnson: Once the appellant accepts the record-\nsupported facts alleged by his opponent, the court of appeals has jurisdiction to give\nfresh review to whether one party should win as a matter of law or whether the case\nshould go to a jury.\n\n       Ninth, today’s case confirms many of these complications and potential sources\nof disagreement. Broad or narrow reading of Johnson? My view: narrow. The\nmajority’s view: broad. Is the issue forfeitable? All three of us seem to agree it is not.\nDoes Johnson apply to state-law claims? My view: if there is no interlocutory\njurisdiction over the federal claims, there is none over the state law claims. The\nmajority’s view: even when there is a Johnson defect with the federal claims, the court\nof appeals has authority to review the state law claims and may view those claims\nwithout applying the Johnson rule to them. Do we even need to get into this? All three\nof us feel the need to do so—so much so that the majority claims my interpretation of\nJohnson amounts to an anticipatory overruling of it. No doubt my reading of Johnson\nwill make it frequently inapplicable, but that is in order to salvage, not bury, the\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                Page 26\n\n\ndecision, the latter of which I suspect happens more often than not when busy appellate\ncourts confront burgeoning appellate dockets. Does Johnson impose a jurisdictional\nor claim-processing inquiry?       My view:     jurisdictional.   The majority’s view:\njurisdictional—except that it affirms rather than dismisses for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       A narrow reading of Johnson eliminates all of these sources of disagreement, and\nI would prefer to adopt it here.\n\f",

Plaintiff Candido Romo was sitting in the driver’s seat\nof a parked car, intoxicated, when he was approached by defendant Officer Jeff Largen.\nLargen arrested Romo for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, assertedly based on\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 2\n\n\nLargen’s observation of Romo’s having driven the car minutes earlier. Romo contends\nthat he had not been driving. Romo filed a § 1983 suit claiming that Largen violated\nhis constitutional rights and committed several intentional torts. The district court\ndenied Largen’s qualified-immunity motion for summary judgment, finding among other\nthings that a jury could disbelieve Largen’s claim that he had previously seen a very\nsimilar car being driven in violation of traffic laws. Without such prior observation,\nLargen lacked probable cause to arrest Romo. Because this is an interlocutory appeal,\nwe are bound by the district court’s finding that a genuine dispute of material fact\nexisted as to whether Largen had observed such activity, in the absence of objectively\nincontrovertible evidence that he had. We therefore affirm the district court’s denial of\nqualified immunity on Romo’s § 1983 claim. The district court also properly permitted\nsome of Largen’s state-law claims to proceed.\n\n       On November 6, 2010, Candido Romo was supposed to meet his brother and\nbrother-in-law at a bar. However, because the bar’s parking lot was full, he left his\nvehicle, a silver Dodge Ram pickup, at a restaurant across the street. Romo and his\nbrother-in-law began drinking, while his brother served as the designated driver. They\ndrove in Romo’s brother’s truck to several bars, and Romo consumed approximately\nnine beers over the course of the night. At the end of the night, Romo’s brother left\nRomo back at his vehicle. Although it was 35 degrees outside, Romo insisted on\nspending the night in his truck, instead of staying with his relatives or being driven\nhome, because he was afraid the truck would be vandalized. To ensure that Romo would\nnot drive drunk, his brother took Romo’s keys, planning to return them in the morning\nwhen the three met up again for breakfast. Romo sat in his truck, leaned on his center\nconsole, and fell asleep.\n\n       Approximately forty-five minutes later, Romo awoke to a tapping on his window.\nBecause Romo’s car had power windows and he did not have the keys, he opened the\ndoor to see Officer Jeff Largen standing outside. Largen asked Romo what he was\ndoing, and Romo responded that he was “waiting this out.” Over the next ten minutes,\nLargen asked Romo about his night, how he was doing, and whether and how much he\n\fNo. 12-1870           Romo v. Largen                                                           Page 3\n\n\nhad been drinking. Finally, Largen asked “do you know why I pulled you over?” Romo\nresponded by stating that the officer did not pull him over because he was not driving.\nLargen asked Romo if he had passed a semi tanker by the railroad tracks, and Romo\nresponded that he had “been here for a while.” Romo also told Largen that his brother\nhad taken his keys some time before. At this point, Largen activated his microphone and\noffered to “start this conversation over” because “the more you lie to me, the more\nyou’re likely to go to jail.” Largen then continued to accuse Romo of passing a semi\ntanker at a railroad crossing and Romo repeatedly answered “I don’t know what you’re\ntalking about.”\n\n        After this line of questioning proved unfruitful, Largen asked Romo to step out\nof the truck and administered sobriety tests. Romo responded by stating again that he\nwas not driving, saying “my keys aren’t even in the trunk.”1 Largen did not respond to\nthis statement. Largen took Romo through several sobriety tests and, after Romo failed,\nLargen arrested Romo for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. They then had the\nfollowing exchange:\n\n        ROMO: . . . Why’d you pull me over?\n        OFFICER: For about the fifth time, because you passed that semi when\n        you were in the crossing area.\n        ROMO: I wasn’t driving.\n        OFFICER: Okay. That’s your story, sir. You can keep that story. My\n        story’s gonna be something different though, okay?\n        ROMO: I was sitting back there just relaxing.\n\nAfter putting Romo in his car, Largen asked if Romo wanted his wallet or his phone\nfrom the truck, and Romo declined. Largen then stated: “Okay. Do you have - - you\ndon’t have the keys on you. Are they in the vehicle?” Romo responded: “Umm, yeah.\nI’ve been sitting there for a while.”\n\n        As Largen explained why he was arresting Romo, Romo continued to protest his\ninnocence. Largen responded by telling Romo to “[s]ave it for the Judge.” Romo\n\n        1\n          Although the written transcript of the encounter uses the word “trunk,” the last word of the\nsentence is unclear on the tape and Romo more likely said “my keys aren’t even in the truck,” as Romo’s\nvehicle was a pickup truck and did not have a trunk.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                Page 4\n\n\npromised to do so and asked Largen, who had been rifling through the car, if he had\nfound the keys. Largen responded that Romo had said that he did not want the car\nlocked, and Romo stated that he had given the keys to his brother over an hour\npreviously. Largen then waved his hand over the car’s hood without touching it and said\n“I’m sure. That’s why the engine’s still warm to the touch.” Largen then drove Romo\nto the jail. All charges against Romo were later dismissed.\n\n         Largen filed a police report that described the incident. In the police report,\nLargen claimed to have seen in his rear-view mirror “a tan Dodge Ram pass a semi\ntanker in the railroad crossing no passing zone.” He stated that he “turned on the truck\nand then pulled behind it” and that the “truck had pulled into the parking lot behind Big\nT and stopped.” The police report noted that Romo had denied driving and had stated\n“I wasn’t driving my kids aren’t even in the car.” In the police report, Largen claimed\nthat he “placed [his] hand on the hood of the truck and it was warm” although since it\nwas “less than 35 degrees . . . the hood would have been cold [had Romo not recently\ndriven the truck.]” Largen would later clarify that he did not follow the Dodge Ram into\nthe Big T parking lot. Instead, he “pulled a U-turn and lost sight of it for a second,\ncouple seconds, whatever.” He then did another U-turn, to face the direction the Dodge\nwas going, but it was nowhere in sight. At that point, he decided that it likely headed\nwest down a different street, and turned down that street. It was only at that point that\nhe saw Romo’s vehicle.\n\n         Romo filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Michigan law. His complaint\nincluded federal claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution. The complaint also\nstated, without elaboration, that Largen “violated [Romo]’s right to equal protection.”\nRomo also claimed that Largen committed the intentional torts of false arrest, false\nimprisonment, and malicious prosecution. Largen claimed qualified and governmental\nimmunity and moved for summary judgment.\n\n         The district court determined that there were “at least three basic narratives\npossible from what’s going on here.” The first is that Largen fabricated the background\nstory.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                    Page 5\n\n\n        That he never really did see a truck pass a semi on the right over the\n        railroad track no matter what color it was. That he simply happened\n        upon this truck in a parking lot, seen somebody sleeping in there, and\n        then the rest unfolds into the arrest, and that he made up the whole story.\n        ...\n\nIn that case, the district court noted that “a reasonable fact-finder could conclude no\nreasonable officer, mistaken or otherwise, could conclude there’s probable cause on that.\nAnd that’s, I think, on a record like this, enough to send the case to the jury.” The\ndistrict court later noted that “a jury conceivably could discount” Largen’s story.\n\n        The second possible narrative is that Largen’s story, including the warm hood,\nis entirely correct. In that case, the district court noted that probable cause may have\nexisted. However “that’s not a story [the court] can accept for purposes of evaluating\na defense motion for summary judgment.”\n\n        The court, like the parties, spent the most time on the third possible narrative.\nIn that version of the story, Largen “ma[d]e up the part about the warm hood and the\nwarm engine, but then he really did see a Dodge truck pull alongside the semi on the\nrailroad tracks, saw it in his rear-view mirror, . . . [but] didn’t have continuous contact,\n[and] the colors [of the trucks] were different.” Id. “[E]ven if that’s the scenario,” the\ncourt determined, “summary judgment would be inappropriate.”\n\n        The district court stated that while a jury may “ultimately agree with the officer\non the defense theory, . . . it’s one of those cases that should be the jury’s call as opposed\nto my call” and denied summary judgment on the federal false-arrest claim. The court\nalso denied summary judgment on the state-law claims because they are similar, albeit\nwith a malice requirement that the court determined was fact oriented. Finally, the\ndistrict court denied summary judgment on the federal malicious-prosecution claim,\nfinding that bond conditions may be enough of an additional deprivation of liberty to\nfulfill the requirements for that claim.\n\n        Largen now appeals. He argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his\n“reasonable but mistaken belief that Romo was driving the pickup truck [he] observed\n\fNo. 12-1870            Romo v. Largen                                                               Page 6\n\n\ncommit a traffic violation.” He also argues that the state-law claims should have been\ndismissed because he acted in good faith, that the federal malicious-prosecution claim\nshould have been dismissed because the charges against Romo were dismissed, and that\nthe equal-protection claim, which was not discussed below, should be dismissed.\n\n         While the parties argue extensively about the third scenario, the district court’s\ntreatment of the first scenario is sufficient for affirmance. In adjudicating this appeal,\nwe are required by the limitations on interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity denials\nto accept the district court’s finding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to\nwhether Largen fabricated the whole or a part of his story about seeing a Dodge Ram\npickup pass a semi tanker, and we refuse to consider Largen’s factual disputations to the\ncontrary.2 In the Supreme Court’s words, “a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified\nimmunity defense, may not appeal a district court’s summary judgment order insofar as\nthat order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’ issue of\nfact for trial.” Johnson v.

No reasonable officer would believe that he\n\n         2\n           This limitation is not prudential, optional, or discretionary.

The limitation is in that sense “jurisdictional.” The fact that\nat the end of this opinion we “affirm” rather than “dismiss” reflects that we are ruling on what is properly\nbefore us, and says nothing about what is jurisdictionally not before us.\n         3\n            This court may reverse, notwithstanding Johnson v.

This court has followed the Third Circuit’s analysis. See Bishop v. Hackel,\n636 F.3d757, 769 (6th Cir. 2008); Carter v. City of Wyoming, 294 F. App’x 990, 992 (6th Cir. 2008);\nWysong, 260 F. App’x at 853. In Scott, the plaintiff’s version of the facts, which the district court\naccepted, was “so utterly discredited by the record,” which included a video of the incident, “that no\nreasonable jury could have believed him.” 550 U.S. at 380. Thus, in cases where “opposing parties tell\ntwo different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could\nbelieve it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary\njudgment.” Id. If a district court ignores this instruction and accepts the blatantly contradicted facts, “a\ncourt of appeals may say so, even on interlocutory review.” Wysong, 260 F. App’x at 853 (quoting\nBlaylock, 504 F.3d at 414). This “represents a principled way to read Johnson and Scott together and to\ncorrect the rare blatant and demonstrable error without allowing Scott to swallow Johnson.” Carter, 294\nF.

Such an approach is facially\ncontradicted by the Supreme Court’s instructions in Johnson to “take, as given, the facts\nthat the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment” and, when that is\nunclear, to “determine what facts the district court . . . likely assumed.” Johnson,\n515 U.S. at 319. The Court considered and dismissed the criticisms of this approach that\nthe concurrence raises. See id.\n\n         Thus, to accept the reading of Johnson advocated by the concurrence, we would\nhave to read Scott to have foreshadowed the overruling of Johnson’s explicit holding.4\nIt may be proper in very clear situations for a lower court to anticipate the Supreme\nCourt’s overruling of one of its precedents.5 But such instances should be limited to the\nmost compelling of inferences from intervening cases.

The instant appeal hardly presents a situation in which to disregard\nsuch admonitions. The Scott opinion did not even mention the Johnson holding, and\nScott is easily limited as an exception for blatantly contradicted facts. It is up to the\nSupreme Court to overrule Johnson, and Scott does not provide us a basis for\nanticipating—much less predicting with compelling confidence—that the Supreme Court\nwill do so.\n\n       We next consider Largen’s appeal of the denial of governmental immunity on\nRomo’s state-law claims. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Romo, Largen\ndid not have probable cause to arrest Romo for operating while intoxicated and a jury\ncould find that Largen acted with malice.         The district court properly denied\ngovernmental immunity to Largen. Largen did not have any evidence that Romo was\noperating the truck. Largen found Romo intoxicated and sleeping in his truck. Since\npeople rarely sit in their vehicles without driving them, Largen could reasonably suspect\nthat Romo either had driven or was planning to drive while intoxicated. However,\nRomo’s responses to Largen’s questioning should have dispelled those suspicions.\nRomo explained that he was sleeping off a night of drinking, that he had not been\ndriving, and that he could not drive because he did not have the keys. Although Largen\nclaims that he heard Romo say that his kids, rather than his keys, were in the truck, he\nlater states “you don’t have the keys on you,” suggesting that he had heard Romo say he\ndid not have the keys at some point during the conversation. Romo also stated in his\ndeposition that he told Largen that his brother had taken his keys before Largen even\nturned on the microphone. Romo had a reasonable explanation and Largen had no\ninculpatory evidence.\n\n       Drunk driving is a serious danger to the public, and police are properly\nsuspicious of anyone sitting in his car drunk. However, they need more than presence\nin the driver’s seat of a vehicle for probable cause. For example, in Nettles-Nickerson\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                    Page 9\n\n\nv. Free, the plaintiff had started her car, her brake lights had turned on, and she sat in it\nwhile it was running. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (6th Cir. 2012). This court determined that in\nsuch a situation, a police officer can reasonably believe that the plaintiff was operating\nthe car. The court noted that “nothing impeded Nettles-Nickerson’s ability to move the\ncar” and that she was “able, at any moment, to drive away.” Id. at 291–92. In contrast,\nRomo could not possibly drive anywhere because he did not have the keys. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals has found that a person operates a car once it is put into gear.\nSee City of Plymouth v. Longeway, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (Mich. Ct. App. 2012).\nHowever, if the car is in “park” or not even running, and the person is asleep, then he is\nnot operating the car. See Michigan v. Burton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249245\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249245/people-v-burton/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151 (Mich.

However, Largen had no evidence that\nRomo had driven the car to the parking lot after drinking, and Romo explained that his\nbrother had driven him there and took his keys so that he could not drive.\n\n        To be entitled to governmental immunity under Michigan law, a lower-level\ngovernment official accused of an intentional tort must show that:\n\n                (a) The acts were undertaken during the course of employment\n        and the employee was acting, or reasonably believed that he was acting,\n        within the scope of his authority,\n                (b) the acts were undertaken in good faith, or were not undertaken\n        with malice, and\n                (c) the acts were discretionary, as opposed to ministerial.\n\nOdom v. Wayne County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"837891\"><a href=\"/opinion/837891/odom-v-wayne-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228 (Mich. 2008). The only question here is\nwhether Largen was acting in good faith or with malice. A police officer is entitled to\ngovernmental immunity “if he acted in good faith and honestly believed that he had\nprobable cause to arrest, even if he later learned that he was mistaken.” Id. at 229. This\ntest is subjective, not objective. Id. Largen argues that since the district court stated that\n“the officer sounds like he believes what he’s talking about,” he is entitled to\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                               Page 10\n\n\ngovernmental immunity. However, the court also found that “a reasonable fact-finder\ncould still draw an inference of actual malice.” Moreover, if Largen lied on his police\nreport and to the prosecutor in order to obtain a prosecution of Romo, that is strong\nevidence of malice. Accordingly, Largen is not entitled to governmental immunity on\nRomo’s state-law claims.\n\n       On the other hand, Largen is entitled to summary judgment on Romo’s federal\nmalicious-prosecution and equal protection claims because Romo has stated that he is\nno longer pursuing these claims. See Romo Br. at 38–39.\n\n       The district court’s denial of qualified immunity with respect to Romo’s federal\nmalicious-prosecution claim is reversed. The judgment of the district court is otherwise\naffirmed.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v.

One aspect of\nthis case is easy: deciding whether Romo’s false-arrest claim should go to a jury. Once\nwe give Romo’s testimony all of the inferences to which it is entitled at summary\njudgment, it is clear that a reasonable jury could grant him relief on this claim. Another\naspect of this case is not: deciding how to apply Johnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995),\nand deciding whether we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. The majority\noffers one way of applying Johnson to this appeal. I write separately to offer another\nway of looking at it.\n\n        In Johnson, Houston Jones filed an excessive force claim against five policemen\nwho allegedly beat him. Three of the officers moved for summary judgment. Their\nargument? “We didn’t do it,” an argument supported by the three officers’ affidavits but\nin tension with Jones’s evidence-supported arguments. In a quintessential application\nof Civil Rule 56, the district court held that the jury should resolve this material fact\ndispute. The officers filed an appeal, insisting once more that they didn’t do it. “When\nasked at oral argument if they could lose the factual dispute and still prevail, defendants’\nlawyer answered no.” Jones v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672088\"><a href=\"/opinion/672088/houston-jones-v-tyson-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728 (7th Cir. 1994). In a 6-\nparagraph per curiam opinion, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction on the ground that “defendants may urge only legal issues on [interlocutory]\nappeals.” Id. at 727.\n\n        The Supreme Court followed the Seventh Circuit’s approach and elaborated on\nit. In the normal course, the Court explained, a denial of summary judgment is not final,\nand appellate courts must wait for a district court to issue a final order before reviewing\nthe case. 515 U.S. at 309. That patience saves appellate resources, prevents delay and\nkeeps pretrial matters where they belong—with the district court. Id. at 317. But\nqualified immunity is not a typical summary judgment defense; it is an immunity from\nstanding trial. Forcing an official who loses in the district court to wait for a jury verdict\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                  Page 12\n\n\nbefore appellate review would defeat an essential component of the defense. See id. at\n315–17. The prospect of interlocutory qualified immunity appeals in this area thus pits\nthe desire to protect government employees from needless trials against the fear of\nclogging appellate dockets with delay-creating and essentially frivolous appeals.\n\n        In a unanimous decision, Johnson tried to resolve that tension. A defendant may\nimmediately appeal a denial of qualified immunity “to the extent that it turns on an issue\nof law,” such as whether the defendant violated a clearly established constitutional right.\nId. at 313 (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1985)). But defendants who\nmerely want to argue evidentiary sufficiency have to wait until after trial. Id. District\ncourts have more experience sifting through convoluted factual records, the Court\nexplained, and asking the courts of appeals to take a second look at discovery documents\nrisks unduly postponing a plaintiff’s day in court. Id. at 316. And all of that time would\nbe wasted if, after affirming, the jury finds in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant\nappeals yet again. Id. at 316–17. In view of these concerns and others, Johnson told\nappellate courts to limit their interlocutory resources to questions of law.\n\n        Keeping in mind that courts do not read judicial opinions like statutes, I submit\nthat there are two ways to read Johnson. One applies it only to prototypical “he said, she\nsaid” fact disputes, in which the defendants (usually government employees) refuse to\naccept the truth of what the plaintiffs (usually individual claimants) say happened.\nWhen the appeal boils down to dueling accounts of what happened and when the\ndefendants insist on acknowledging on appeal only their accounts, the underlying basis\nfor an interlocutory appeal disappears.\n\n        The other applies the decision not just to whether the defendant officers accept\nthe plaintiff’s evidence-supported version of what happened but also to whether the\ndefendants accept the district court’s reading of the inferences from those facts: here,\nwhether Officer Largen lied about seeing a Dodge Ram on the road. Under that view\n(and the majority’s view), when a district court determines that there is a “genuine issue\nof fact” for trial by drawing an inference in favor of the plaintiff, the appellate court may\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v.

I favor the former\nreading.\n\n        First, my proposed reading respects Scott v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), which\npost-dates Johnson. In Scott, Deputy Timothy Scott followed Victor Harris in a high-\nspeed chase. Worried that Harris’s reckless driving posed a threat to the public, Scott\nran Harris off the road, which caused a crash, which left Harris a quadriplegic. Harris\nsued, alleging excessive force, and the parties introduced a videotape of the chase at\nsummary judgment. According to the district court, reasonable minds could disagree\nabout whether Harris posed a real risk, creating a fact issue for the jury. It wrote: “A\nrational fact finder could find that a reasonable officer would not have believed that\nbecause of his traffic offense, Harris posed an immediate threat to the safety of\nothers. . . . Harris did not use his vehicle in an aggressive manner. . . . A jury could also\nfind that Scott’s use of force—ramming the car while traveling at high speeds—was not\nin proportion to the risk that Harris posed, and therefore was objectively unreasonable.”\nHarris v. Coweta Cnty., Ga., No. CIVA 3:01CV 148 WBH, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">25419527</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5\n(N.D. Ga. Sept. 25, 2003). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on the merits and rejected the\n“argument that we are without jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.” Harris v.\nCoweta Cnty., Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 n.3 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n        The Supreme Court reversed on the merits. “At the summary judgment stage,”\nit started, “facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only\nif there is a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.” 550 U.S. at 380 (quoting Civil Rule\n56(c)). Harris’s account—that he remained relatively in control—was “blatantly\ncontradicted by the record,” namely the videotape, which showed him driving\n“shockingly fast,” “swerv[ing]” and “forc[ing] cars . . . to their respective shoulders to\navoid being hit.” Id. at 379–80. “[N]o reasonable jury could have believed” Harris’s\n“version of events,” and, the Court held, neither the district court nor the Eleventh\nCircuit should have accepted his version either. Id. at 380.\n\n        The details of Harris’s driving were not in dispute; the video laid those to rest.\nWhat mattered were the inferences those details could support: Was Harris driving\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 14\n\n\nsafely? Those inferences, Scott illustrates, remain subject to interlocutory review. A\ncontrary reading of Johnson—that in no event does an appellate court have jurisdiction\nto say a district court drew the wrong inferences—cannot co-exist with Scott. This\nreading of Scott also respects Behrens v. Pelletier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), which cautions\nthat “[d]enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are\ncontroverted issues of material fact, and Johnson surely does not mean that every such\ndenial of summary judgment is nonappealable.” Id. at 842.\n\n       Second, the only way to avoid this reading of the holdings of Johnson and Scott\nis to create distinctions that are not driven by meaningful differences or that would be\ndifficult to implement in practice. One might for example limit Scott to videos (and\naudio recordings), reasoning that appellate courts need not defer to the eyes (or ears) of\ndistrict courts when the relevant evidence comes in the form of a video or audio of the\nencounter as opposed to dueling eyewitness accounts of the encounter disclosed in\ndepositions. But one need not be an expert in the senses to appreciate that the capacity\nof appellate judges to identify untenable inferences in a district court’s assessment of a\nvideo and an audio depiction of an event may apply just as often to their capacity to see\nuntenable inferences in a district court’s assessment of a deposition transcript. In both\ncases, the district and appellate court judges are looking at the same thing.\n\n       Or one could say, as today’s majority does, that Scott trumps Johnson only when\nthe district court’s assessment of the inferences to draw is “blatantly contradicted by the\nrecord.” Scott, 550 U.S. at 380. Only if the district court was really wrong would we\nthus have authority to review the district court’s reading of the inferences. But the most\nstraightforward way to say that a district court did not make such a mistake is to say that\na reasonable jury could rule for the plaintiff on that record. That is the traditional\nquestion we consider in reviewing qualified-immunity interlocutory appeals. If Johnson\nis designed to protect appellate courts from record review, how does a “blatantly\ncontradicted by the record” standard help? It does not allow us to ignore depositions and\ndocuments we would otherwise read, as those same items will be the source of any such\nclear-error argument. That explains why the majority in this case must review that same\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 15\n\n\nsort of record evidence here—to assure itself that the district court did not blatantly\ncontradict the record. See Maj. Op. at 6–7 n.3. A defendant making a Scott claim and\na defendant raising a de novo challenge to the lower court’s inferences are asking us to\ndo much the same thing. Even if it turns out to be only the occasional case that meets\nthe Scott standard, I doubt it will be only the occasional lawyer who argues that the\ndistrict court badly misread the record. This reading of Johnson thus trades a long-\nestablished direct approach to qualified-immunity appeals for a complicated indirect\napproach that ultimately returns to the same question (or something very close to it).\nAnd this reading implies that we have jurisdiction to reverse badly drawn inferences but\nno jurisdiction to affirm less than badly drawn inferences—a new and strange version\nof appellate power. What, in short, has been gained?\n\n       Third, much may be lost with a broad interpretation of Johnson, as it implicates\na jurisdictional inquiry that raises the stakes and complexities of the debate. Johnson\nsays that a defendant who loses a qualified immunity motion “may not appeal a district\ncourt’s summary judgment order,” and that the court of appeals lacks “jurisdiction” over\nsuch an appeal, “insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets\nforth a ‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial.” 515 U.S. at 309, 319–20. Since Johnson, it is\ntrue, the Court “has endeavored . . . to bring some discipline to the use of the term\n‘jurisdictional.’” Gonzalez v. Thaler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620566\"><a href=\"/opinion/620566/gonzalez-v-thaler/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But it is\ndifficult to see how Johnson does not implicate core subject matter jurisdiction.\nCongress has granted courts of appeals “jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions\nof the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. That speaks to subject matter jurisdiction. See\nBowles v. Russell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145714\"><a href=\"/opinion/145714/bowles-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (2007).

That too speaks to subject\nmatter jurisdiction. See Mohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1751/mohawk-industries-inc-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, 114 (2009).\nAnd Mitchell v.

That too speaks to subject matter jurisdiction. See Mohawk\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 16\n\n\nIndus., 558 U.S. at 106. It follows that Johnson raises an unyielding jurisdictional\ninquiry, one that the courts of appeals must raise whether they like it or not, whether the\nparties have raised it or not.\n\n        That is a tall order if courts embrace a broad interpretation of Johnson. It is\ndifficult to think of qualified immunity appeals that do not involve inference drawing by\nthe district courts, whether implied or explicit. And there are few days of oral argument\nin the life of an appellate judge that do not involve at least one qualified immunity\ninterlocutory appeal. This case is a good example of the task that awaits us. Neither\nparty mentioned Johnson in its briefs. All that appears in the plaintiff’s brief on this\nscore is this stand-alone sentence: “In fact, given that the court ruled that these\ncredibility disputes created a factual issue regarding what actually happened that must\nbe determined by a jury, which directly affects the evidence allegedly supporting\nprobable cause, this should not even be an issue that is subject to an appeal. Gregory v.\nCity of Louisville, 744 [sic] F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2006).” App’ee Br. at 30. If we followed\nthe normal rules for identifying error, we would say that the plaintiff forfeited any\nJohnson argument. The argument is not identified (or embedded) in the issues presented\non appeal, it is undeveloped, and it leaves the reader guessing what the appellee means\nto argue. See Johns v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799146\"><a href=\"/opinion/799146/johns-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408–09 (6th Cir. 2012). To its credit, the\nmajority nonetheless takes on the Johnson issue, as indeed it must if it implicates our\njurisdiction. In view of the underlying interpretation of § 1291 implicated by all\ninterlocutory appeals and in view of the prohibition on “hypothetical” jurisdiction, Steel\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1998), that is the only path available\nto us. Yet the majority’s approach pulls jurisdiction into many, if not most, qualified\nimmunity appeals, whereas my interpretation of Johnson—confining it to “I didn’t do\nit” appeals—will create few jurisdictional disputes.\n\n        Fourth, a broad interpretation of Johnson not only requires us to police subject\nmatter jurisdiction in a great many cases, but it also requires us to do so by reviewing the\nrecord in new and unusual ways. At first glance, the reader might think that separating\nauthority to review law-based appeals from authority to review fact-based appeals is\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 17\n\n\neasy. It is not. Yes, a qualified-immunity appeal based solely on what the Constitution\nmeans or whether an interpretation of it was clearly established at a given point in time\nraises purely legal issues. But the classic summary judgment question—could a\nreasonable jury rule for the plaintiff on this record as construed in his favor?—also raises\na “legal” question, even though it is intertwined with the facts, which is why appellate\ncourts traditionally give fresh review to district court decisions in this area. Milligan v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"624266\"><a href=\"/opinion/624266/milligan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (6th Cir. 2012). The rub is that Johnson appears to\ndivide this last category into appealable and non-appealable decisions. I would construe\nthe decision as applying only when the defendant refuses to accept the truth of the\nplaintiff’s evidence at summary judgment by maintaining for example that he didn’t do\nit when the plaintiff produces evidence that he did. The majority would construe the\ndecision as applying whenever the defendant challenges the inferences drawn by the\ndistrict court in denying the summary judgment motion.\n\n        The majority’s approach creates two unpalatable options when it comes to\nreviewing summary judgment decisions. The first is to comb the record to figure out the\ninferences that the district court likely drew, then to defer to those assumed inferences.\nJohnson, 515 U.S. at 319. If those inferences create a genuine issue of material fact, no\njurisdiction exists. The other option is to defer only to the inferences the district court\nactually drew on the record, see, e.g., Lewis v. Tripp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173419\"><a href=\"/opinion/173419/lewis-v-tripp/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1226 (10th Cir.\n2010), and no jurisdiction exists if those inferences create a genuine issue of material\nfact. While the latter approach has the virtue of being real rather than imagined, it\ncreates problems of its own. In my experience, district court judges generally do not\nwrite summary judgment opinions in this way. Take this decision, which the judge\ndelivered orally, presumably because he placed a (legitimate) premium on resolving this\nsummary judgment motion promptly. The district court explained why the plaintiff\ncould win based on the court’s reading of the record, intermingling verbatim statements\nfrom the various depositions, paraphrases from those depositions and inferences from\nthe depositions. That is not unusual. I indeed have not come across trial judges who\ndistinguish between facts and inferences or who explain the difference material fact by\nmaterial fact. That perhaps is because Johnson speaks to what appellate judges should\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 18\n\n\ndo, not to what district court judges should do, and I doubt the point of Johnson was to\npile new tasks onto trial judges’ work loads or to tell them how to do their jobs. Much\nsimpler, I think, to let appellate courts do what they long have done by taking a fresh\nlook at the traditional (non-jurisdictional) summary judgment question: After giving the\nnon-movant (usually the plaintiff) the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the\nrecord, does the case create a material triable issue of fact?\n\n        Fifth, efforts to work around these problems will create problems of their own.\nCourts for example might construe Johnson as giving appellate judges the option of\ndismissing appeals for lack of jurisdiction. Consistent with this approach, one court has\ncalled the Johnson inquiry a “prudential” one, M.M.R.-Z. v. Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203316\"><a href=\"/opinion/203316/mmr-z-ex-rel-ramirez-senda-v-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\n(1st Cir. 2008). From what I can tell, that seems to be the approach the majority has\ntaken. After engaging in the Johnson inquiry and after noting that the appellant (Officer\nLargen) has failed to accept the district court’s inferences from the record, the court\nnonetheless “affirm[s]” and “uphold[s]” the district court’s decision rather than\ndismissing this part of it for lack of jurisdiction. Maj. Op. at 7, 10. The majority insists\nthat Johnson remains a jurisdictional rule in our circuit, but offers an explanation for its\njudgment with which I am unfamiliar: “The fact that at the end of this opinion we\n‘affirm’ rather than ‘dismiss’ reflects that we are ruling on what is properly before us,\nand says nothing about what is jurisdictionally not before us.” Id. at 6 n.2. As shown,\nCohen and Mitchell (and thus Johnson as well) interpret § 1291, which makes any\napplication of those decisions (whether narrowing or broadening) jurisdictional. The\nbaseline norm at any rate is that courts should resolve all disputes—including\nappeals—that Congress authorizes them to resolve. Cohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n404 (1821). We should not lightly create exceptions to that “unflagging” obligation.\nDeakins v. Monaghan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111975\"><a href=\"/opinion/111975/deakins-v-monaghan/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis cure, in short, seems worse than the disease.\n\n        Johnson itself acknowledged another way around these knotty issues, though it\nis not one the Court seemed to endorse. It “assum[ed], for the sake of argument, that it\nmay sometimes be appropriate to exercise ‘pendent appellate jurisdiction’ over” a\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 19\n\n\ndistrict court’s genuine-issue-of-material-fact decision. 515 U.S. at 318 (citing Swint v.\nChambers Cnty.

An appeal that raised purely\nlegal questions under prong one of the qualified immunity inquiry (what does the\nConstitution mean in this setting?) or prong two (was the right clearly established when\nthe officers acted?) thus would create appellate jurisdiction over these issues and pendent\nappellate jurisdiction over any other issues raised by the district court’s decision. After\nacknowledging this possibility, Johnson said it was “unlikely that Courts of Appeals”\nwould exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction “where the appealable issue appears\nsimply a means to lead the court to review the underlying factual matter.” Id. Fair\nenough.\n\n        But in our circuit and, best I can tell, in most circuits, the test for pendent\nappellate jurisdiction—whether the two issues are “inextricably intertwined,” Chambers\nv.

Will it not\nusually be the case, at prong one of the qualified immunity inquiry, that the meaning of\nthe Constitution and the underlying facts are inextricably intertwined? How could they\nnot be? They often implicate “mixed questions of law and fact,” Williams v. Mehra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765529\"><a href=\"/opinion/765529/ruth-ann-williams-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-anthony-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc), the epitome of inextricably intertwined law and\nfact issues. They are called mixed, as opposed to segregated, questions of law and fact\nfor a reason. And even when that is not the case, how does one decide what the\nConstitution means without regard to the facts? So too with the clearly established\ninquiry, one that looks at whether the officers should have known that their fact pattern\ndid not permit them to act the way they did under then-existing law. Keep in mind,\nmoreover, that the question is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. Even if\nthe genuine-issue question somehow is purely factual in nature, the issue of materiality\nis not. Which facts are material to a constitutional claim will always be a legal question,\nintertwining the genuine-issue fact question and the constitutional standard implicated\nby the plaintiff’s claim. Cf. Livermore v. Lubelan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796758\"><a href=\"/opinion/796758/geraldine-livermore-personal-representative-for-the-estate-of-roland-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407 (6th Cir. 2007).\nRather than engage in debates about this or that path to pendent appellate jurisdiction in\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                   Page 20\n\n\ntoday’s case, I would affirm on the traditional ground that, once the officer accepts the\ntruth of the plaintiff’s evidence-supported factual allegations, his appeal fails to rebut the\nargument that a reasonable jury could rule against him on this record.\n\n        Why, moreover, should the officer willing to concede the truth of the plaintiff’s\nevidence-supported version of the facts not get interlocutory review over the district\ncourt’s genuine-issue-of-fact determination (itself a legal question), but the officer who\nchallenges that and the district court’s understanding of the meaning of the Constitution\ngets interlocutory review? If the difference turns on efficiency, that is an unusual\nexplanation for a court-made jurisdictional rule and at all events not necessarily true.\nThe capacity of district courts and appellate courts to identify triable issues of material\nfact based on the review of paper records strikes me as about equal—and as being done\nby both just as frequently. And while interlocutory review delays a potential trial, the\nappeal will potentially avoid unnecessary constitutional rulings, see Pearson v.\nCallahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (2009), end the case (if the officer wins), often prompt a\nsettlement (if the officer loses) or often eliminate a later appeal (if the officer loses the\nappeal and the jury trial). As to this last point, while the summary judgment record and\nthe jury record often will differ, they normally will differ in ways that make it more\ndifficult for an officer to win on appeal, as the appellate court will be asked to second\nguess not just inferences that could be drawn from a paper record but inferences that may\nbe drawn from eyeballing the witnesses as well. In the end, if the district court is wrong\nabout permissible fact inferences at summary judgment, even if not “blatantly” wrong,\nI do not understand why we should force these officers to undertake a trial.\n\n        Sixth, a broad reading of Johnson is in tension with related principles of qualified\nimmunity, jurisdiction and judicial administration. The courts are reluctant to make\nappealability decisions in this area turn on the novelties of individual cases as opposed\nto principles that cut across groups of traditional appeals. “Making appealability depend\nupon . . . factor[s] particular to the case at hand[] would violate the principle . . . that\nappealability determinations are made for classes of decisions not individual orders in\nspecific cases.” Behrens, 516 U.S. at 312. By making jurisdiction turn on the facts in\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v.

Callahan suggests another way of looking at this problem. That case\noverruled Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), which required courts to resolve prong\none (the current meaning of the Constitution) of a qualified immunity defense before\nmoving to prong two (the clearly established meaning of the Constitution at the time of\nthe incident). One of the problems with that “rigid order of battle,” Pearson, 555 U.S.\nat 234, was the frequency with which courts ignored it. Saucier was mandatory—but\nnot when the case was overly factbound, id. at 237, or when the Supreme Court granted\ncertiorari on a related issue, id. at 238, or when state law came into play, id. These\nexceptions undermined, not proved, the rule, and any rule ought not to be honored in the\nbreach. A broad reading of Johnson, I fear, raises similar problems. It forbids record\nreview—but not when the district court made a blatant error or when the district court\nwas not explicit or when intent or mixed questions of law and fact come into play or\nwhen pendent appellate jurisdiction is exercised.\n\n        The majority’s reading of Johnson also creates tension with Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), which requires courts to determine whether the inferences a\nplaintiff wants a jury to draw are “plausible.” Id. at 678. No doubt, it may be easier for\nappellate courts to draw reasonable inferences from complaints than from summary\njudgment records. But how strange to think that the distinction is jurisdictional—that\na court of appeals has jurisdiction to overturn a district court’s reading of the inferences\nat the motion to dismiss stage but not at the summary judgment stage—a theory that may\nhave the incidental (and unintended) effect of encouraging defendants to file appeals at\neach stage.\n\n        Seventh, a broad reading of Johnson creates other oddities with respect to mixed\nquestions of law and fact and questions of intent, which frequently come up in qualified\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v.

See Dixon v. Donald, 291 F. App’x 759, 762\n(6th Cir. 2008) (“To the extent that Donald is arguing the existence of exigent\ncircumstances . . . he is raising genuine issues of material fact that Johnson prohibits us\nfrom reviewing.”); Elliott v.

If so, how does that interpretation advance\nthe efficiency concerns of Johnson? One would have thought that an earlier, rather than\na later, appellate ruling on the meaning of law in an accepted setting of facts would help\neveryone, the parties and the district court included.\n\n        A broad reading of Johnson requires appellate courts to separate (unreviewable)\nfactual inferences from (reviewable) legal conclusions. This assignment calls to mind\nthe ill-starred distinction nineteenth century pleading rules drew between ultimate facts\n(which plaintiffs could, indeed had to, plead) and conclusions of law (which they could\nnot). See Charles E. Clark, The Complaint in Code Pleading, 35 Yale L. J. 259, 259–60\n(1926). An example illustrates the perplexities that await. Suppose that a district court\nfaced with an exigent circumstances case concludes that the plaintiff’s behavior did not\nmanifest a risk of “imminent destruction of evidence.” Brigham City v. Stuart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145654\"><a href=\"/opinion/145654/brigham-city-v-stuart/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403 (2006). Has the court drawn a factual inference from the plaintiff’s behavior?\nOr has it reached a legal conclusion about the applicability of a particular justification\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                 Page 23\n\n\nfor a warrantless search? Whatever the answer, does it make sense to hinge jurisdiction\non such a will-o’-the-wisp distinction?\n\n       Eighth, all of these distinctions and complexities increase the odds that appellate\njurisdiction will turn on the quality of the lawyer a party happens to hire. It is the rare\nqualified-immunity appeal that does not implicate the meaning of the Constitution, and\nit is the rare capable attorney who thus cannot frame an appeal that invokes that core\nappellate jurisdiction. What happens as a result is that lawyers schooled in Johnson\nknow how to avoid its shoals (by raising a colorable legal question, which is not a high\nbar, see Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89) and lawyers unschooled in Johnson unwittingly\napproach its shoals, requiring appellate courts to resolve a difficult, sometimes\nexcruciating, jurisdictional question, made more difficult by the flexible opt-in of\npendent appellate jurisdiction, instead of simply affirming on the merits because the\nplaintiff’s claim implicates a triable issue of material fact. This case could have been\nresolved by a three-page summary order to that exact effect. Once the officers\nacknowledged that they had to accept the reasonable inferences from plaintiffs’ record-\nsupported evidence, as their attorney did at oral argument, appellate jurisdiction existed,\nand we could have affirmed on that basis then and there.\n\n       On a related score, it is not unusual for lawyers to pay tribute to Johnson,\nsuggesting they are willing to accept the plaintiff’s version of the facts or the district\ncourt’s inferences from those facts but nonetheless shading the recitation of those facts\nin their client’s favor, whether at the briefing stage or at oral argument. See Estate of\nCarter v. City of Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790266\"><a href=\"/opinion/790266/estate-of-tori-carter-brenda-chambers-v-city-of-detroit-donald-hollins/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (6th Cir. 2005) (“[T]his court can ignore the\ndefendant’s attempts to dispute the facts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue,\nobviating the need to dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction.”). Lawyers will\nbe lawyers when it comes to this kind of thing, not because there is anything wrong with\nthem but because it is human nature to shade facts and inferences in favor of the\nadvocate’s position. We ought to be wary of a rule for processing a high percentage of\nappeals that is a trap for some and easy to evade for others—and that requires a degree\nof restraint that is difficult for most lawyers, indeed most human beings, to muster.\n\fNo. 12-1870         Romo v. Largen                                                  Page 24\n\n\nLittle is gained, and much is lost, and the difference from the party’s perspective often\nwill turn on nothing more than the acumen of the attorney he can afford to hire.\n\n        The option of pendent appellate jurisdiction and the ease with which most\nlawyers can avoid Johnson jurisdictional problems might suggest that I should not be\ntroubled by the majority’s reading of it. That may be true in one sense. If ingenuity is\na key that invariably unlocks the gateway to appellate jurisdiction, that is no less true for\njudges than for lawyers. But it does not flatter a legal rule that it is so often implicated\nand so easily avoided, particularly when it goes to jurisdiction.\n\n        Nor does it seem helpful that, nearly twenty years after Johnson, every circuit in\nthe country has some decisions that adopt my reading of it and some that adopt the\nmajority’s. Start with our circuit. Some support the majority’s view.

In view of these intra-circuit conflicts, it should not go unmentioned that\nadditional litigation over appealability, an inevitable outcome of any uncertainty over\nthe scope of it, adds to appellate work loads: one hundred and eighty degrees away from\nJohnson’s goal. I would resolve that problem and the others mentioned above by\nadopting a narrow interpretation of Johnson: Once the appellant accepts the record-\nsupported facts alleged by his opponent, the court of appeals has jurisdiction to give\nfresh review to whether one party should win as a matter of law or whether the case\nshould go to a jury.\n\n       Ninth, today’s case confirms many of these complications and potential sources\nof disagreement. Broad or narrow reading of Johnson? My view: narrow. The\nmajority’s view: broad. Is the issue forfeitable? All three of us seem to agree it is not.\nDoes Johnson apply to state-law claims? My view: if there is no interlocutory\njurisdiction over the federal claims, there is none over the state law claims. The\nmajority’s view: even when there is a Johnson defect with the federal claims, the court\nof appeals has authority to review the state law claims and may view those claims\nwithout applying the Johnson rule to them. Do we even need to get into this? All three\nof us feel the need to do so—so much so that the majority claims my interpretation of\nJohnson amounts to an anticipatory overruling of it. No doubt my reading of Johnson\nwill make it frequently inapplicable, but that is in order to salvage, not bury, the\n\fNo. 12-1870        Romo v. Largen                                                Page 26\n\n\ndecision, the latter of which I suspect happens more often than not when busy appellate\ncourts confront burgeoning appellate dockets. Does Johnson impose a jurisdictional\nor claim-processing inquiry?       My view:     jurisdictional.   The majority’s view:\njurisdictional—except that it affirms rather than dismisses for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       A narrow reading of Johnson eliminates all of these sources of disagreement, and\nI would prefer to adopt it here.\n\f</pre>",
