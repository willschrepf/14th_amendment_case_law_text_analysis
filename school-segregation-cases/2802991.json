Tex. Penal Code\r\n§19.03(a).  Pursuant to the jury's answers to the special issues set forth in Texas Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure Article 37.071, sections 2(b) and 2(e), the trial judge sentenced\r\nappellant to death.  Article 37.071 §2(g).<sup> (1)</sup>  Direct appeal to this Court is automatic. \r\nArticle 37.071 §2(h).  After reviewing appellant's twenty points of error, we find them to\r\nbe without merit.

Penal Code\r\n§19.03(a)(4).  Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence at both phases of trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a claim that evidence is legally insufficient to support a judgment,\r\n\"the relevant question [on appeal] is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\r\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  <em>Jackson v. Virginia</em>, 443 U.S. 307,\r\n319 (1979).  This standard accounts for the fact finder's duty \"to resolve conflicts in the\r\ntestimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to\r\nultimate facts.\"  <em>Id.</em>  Therefore, in analyzing the legal sufficiency, we will determine\r\nwhether the necessary inferences are reasonable based upon the combined and cumulative\r\nforce of all the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, when viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the verdict.  </span><span> </span><span><em>Clayton v. State</em>, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span></span><span><span></span><em>Guilt Phase</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence at trial established that on September 24, 2007, appellant was an\r\ninmate incarcerated for a felony offense at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\r\n(\"TDCJ\") Wynne Unit located in Huntsville.  He and fellow inmate John Falk were\r\nassigned to the same work squad that morning to hoe and aerate the onion patch.  The\r\nWynne Unit onion patch is outside the main perimeter fence of the prison and adjacent to\r\nthe City of Huntsville Service Center (\"Service Center\").  The Service Center was, at that\r\ntime, separated from prison property by only a chain-link fence in some portions and a\r\nbarbed-wire fence in others.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Four squads had been turned out to work that day, each consisting of twenty\r\ninmates with a single armed guard on horseback.  Each guard carried a .357 revolver with\r\nsix bullets.  An armed supervising sergeant accompanied the squads in the fields.  Finally,\r\na \"high rider\" also patrolled the squads.  The high rider was another guard on horseback\r\nwho patrolled outside the prison fence on Service Center property and acted as the \"last\r\nline of defense\" in the event of an escape attempt.  The high rider carried a .357 revolver\r\nwith six bullets and a .223 rifle with four rounds.  The high rider that day was Officer\r\nSusan Canfield, an experienced rider and guard.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant was part of squad number five, which was assigned to work in the\r\nportion of the onion field closest to the Service Center.  Officer Joe Jeffcoat oversaw\r\nappellant's squad.  Falk was assigned to the row in their squad's section farthest from the\r\nfence, and appellant voluntarily took the row next to him.  Jeffcoat testified that appellant\r\nand Falk were friends and that they usually worked together.  He also noted that he had\r\nnever had any problems with the pair before that day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the squads had been working for a while, appellant approached Jeffcoat\r\nasked him to hold his watch because it had broken.  Jeffcoat agreed.  When appellant got\r\nabout 20 feet from him, Jeffcoat heard something to his left; he turned to see Falk\r\nwalking towards him from the other side.  When he turned back towards appellant,\r\nappellant was already at Jeffcoat's side reaching for his .357 revolver.  Appellant and\r\nJeffcoat began struggling over the gun, and Jeffcoat yelled for help.  Falk then started\r\nshoving Jeffcoat out of his saddle.  Appellant was able to get the gun as Jeffcoat came off\r\nhis horse on top of him.  Jeffcoat began to wrestle with appellant, but Falk came around\r\nand appellant tossed the gun to him.  Jeffcoat let go of appellant and started after Falk, but\r\nFalk pointed the gun at him.  At this time, Jeffcoat heard his superior, Field Sergeant\r\nLarry Grissom, yell to get down, so he did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant and Falk then fled through the barbed-wire fence and onto Service\r\nCenter property.  Grissom and the other guards focused on apprehending Falk because\r\nFalk had the gun.  Appellant ran off in another direction.  Grissom fired twice at Falk, but\r\nFalk ran behind some equipment.  Guards from two of the other squads also fired shots at\r\nFalk but to no avail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt this point, the high rider, Canfield, engaged in a gun fight with Falk.  Canfield\r\nadvanced on Falk while firing at him with her revolver.  When Canfield expended her\r\nbullets, Falk ran at her as she was trying to remove her rifle from its scabbard.  The two\r\nengaged in a struggle for the weapon while Canfield attempted to turn her horse away\r\nfrom Falk.  However, once Falk jabbed his stolen revolver in her ribs, Canfield ceased\r\nstruggling and Falk took the rifle.  Falk then backed away. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMeanwhile, during the gunfight, appellant ran to a truck parked outside the Service\r\nCenter sign shop.  Larry Horstman of the City of Huntsville sign shop testified that the\r\ntruck was a one-ton, flat-bed pick-up truck with toolboxes on the side.  He stated that he\r\nalways parked the truck about 10 feet from the sign shop door and left the keys in it. \r\nJeffcoat testified that he saw the truck parked in the same spot every time he was working\r\nin the onion field. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant got into the truck and sped straight towards Canfield.  Horstman\r\ntestified that he heard his truck take off \"real fast.\"  Other witnesses testified that the\r\ntruck was \"floorboarded,\" \"going as fast as it could go,\" \"being revved at high rpms,\"\r\nleaving acceleration marks as it hit Canfield and her horse just after Falk backed away. \r\nCanfield and the horse went up onto the hood of the truck.  Canfield's back and shoulders\r\nhit the windshield and her head struck the roof.  Canfield was then launched into the air\r\nand came down on her head, shoulder, and neck.  There was no evidence appellant tried\r\nto brake before hitting Canfield or that the truck slid into her and her horse; however, he\r\ndid turn toward the Service Center exit while, or immediately after, striking her with the\r\ntruck.  Witnesses also testified that there was enough room in the Service Center lot that\r\nappellant could have avoided hitting Canfield.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter striking Canfield and her horse, appellant stopped the truck and Falk ran to\r\nthe passenger side and got in.  Jeffcoat testified that they then \"took off as fast as the\r\ntruck could go.\"  Jay Miller, a fire hydrant technician with the Service Center, saw\r\nappellant take the truck and managed to follow it as it left the Service Center lot.  Miller\r\ncalled 9-1-1 and remained on the phone during the chase.  Miller testified that at one\r\npoint the truck's passenger sat up in the windowsill of the truck and pointed a rifle at him. \r\nMiller further testified that the passenger fired at him, but his vehicle was not hit.  Miller\r\ncontinued to chase them on and off the highway until the truck pulled into a parking lot\r\nand the inmates got out and ran into some nearby woods.  Miller parked his vehicle to\r\nblock the road and then chased the inmates on foot to see if they were going to come out\r\non the other side of a fence at the bank next door.  The police arrived at this time and\r\nMiller directed them towards the bank.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker County Deputy Brian Smallwood arrived at the bank to see appellant and\r\nFalk run to a red truck that was in the drive-thru lane.  Falk entered through the driver's\r\ndoor and shoved the female driver over.  Appellant, who now had the rifle, jumped into\r\nthe bed of the truck.  Huntsville Police Sergeant Ron Cleere also observed this and got\r\nout of his vehicle with his gun drawn, but the inmates drove off before he could attempt\r\nto stop them.  Cleere fired at the truck's tires seven times hitting one of them, but the\r\ntruck did not stop.  Both Smallwood and Cleere pursued the red truck.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFalk drove the truck onto the interstate but exited after only 3/4 of a mile.  He\r\npulled onto a grassy field next to some woods because the right front tire was shredded. \r\nSmallwood pulled his car into a ditch 50 yards away from the red truck.  Appellant stood\r\nup in the bed of the truck and pointed the rifle at Smallwood.  Smallwood heard a shot as\r\nhe opened his door.  Smallwood fired at appellant as appellant ran into the woods.  Cleere\r\narrived and fired at appellant as well.  Falk got out of the truck and also ran for the\r\nwoods.  Cleere saw appellant again on the edge of the woods, using the base of a tree to\r\nsteady the rifle.  Cleere went to retrieve his own rifle from his car, but when he returned\r\nhe did not see appellant.  Appellant then stood up and Cleere fired at him with his rifle,\r\nbut appellant got away.  When other officers arrived, they set up a perimeter around the\r\nwooded area.  The owner of the truck was unharmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHuntsville Police Lieutenant Daryl Slaven apprehended Falk behind the Walmart\r\non the other side of the wooded area.  When Falk heard the police car, he stopped and put\r\nhis hands in the air.  The authorities searched for appellant in the wooded area on\r\nhorseback and using dogs.  The rifle was found lying in the woods with three rounds still\r\nin it.  After approximately two hours, appellant's boots and some clothing were found\r\nhidden in the dirt of a creek bed.  Appellant was eventually discovered hiding in a tree\r\nwearing only his underwear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDallas County Medical Examiner Tracy Dyer testified that Canfield died from a\r\nsignificant impact that caused an unsurvivable hinge fracture to her skull which went\r\nfrom ear to ear. Viewing photos of the damage to truck, Dyer opined that it would have\r\ntaken a \"significant amount of velocity\" for Canfield's body to have caused the dent at\r\ntop of the windshield.  She noted that Canfield also sustained a depressed skull fracture as\r\nwell as external injuries including bruising and lacerations to her head, hands, arms,\r\ntrunk, and legs.  Veterinarian Richard Posey testified that Canfield's horse had extensive\r\ninjuries from a bullet wound, plus trauma to its left hip, scrapes on its hips and hock, and\r\na swollen joint on its front leg from the impact.  The horse had to be put down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's first point of error, he complains that the trial court erred in\r\noverruling his motion for a directed verdict on the grounds that the evidence was legally\r\ninsufficient to show that Canfield's death occurred while he was escaping.  Specifically,\r\nhe asserts that Texas Penal Code §19.03(a)(4) incorporates the offense of escape,\r\npursuant to Texas Penal Code §38.06, and that case law dictates the offense of escape was\r\ncomplete when he went through the prison fence onto city property.  <em>See</em> <em>Lawhorn v.\r\nState</em>, 898 S.W.2d 886, 890 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); <em>Fitzgerald v. State</em>, 782 S.W.2d 876,\r\n881 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).<sup> (2)</sup>  For the reasons below, we find that the offense of escape\r\nfound in Texas Penal Code §38.06 is not incorporated into the capital-murder statute.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe provisions of the Penal Code must be \"construed according to the fair import\r\nof their terms, to promote justice and effect the objectives of the code.\"  Tex. Penal\r\nCode §1.05(a).  When attempting to discern the collective legislative intent or purpose of\r\na statute, we focus on the literal text of the statute and attempt to discern a fair and\r\nobjective meaning of the statute's text at the time it was enacted.  <em>Boykin v. State</em>, 818\r\nS.W.2d 782, 785 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).  </span><span>We focus on the text because it is the only\r\ndefinitive evidence of the legislators' intent and the Legislature is constitutionally entitled\r\nto expect the judiciary to faithfully follow the specific text that was adopted. <em> Id</em>. \r\nTherefore, if the meaning of the statute, when read using the canons of construction,\r\nshould have been plain to the legislators who passed it, then we give effect to that plain\r\nmeaning.  <em>Id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUpon examining the language of the capital-murder statute, it is apparent that\r\nwhen the statute requires proof of a predicate offense, it does so explicitly by using\r\nlanguage that the murder was done \"in the course of committing or attempting to commit\"\r\na specific offense.  <em>See</em> Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(2)(listing \"kidnapping, burglary,\r\nrobbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat\r\nunder Section 22.07(a)(1), (3), (4), (5), or (6)\" as offenses).  All of these predicate\r\noffenses are legislatively defined.  <em>See</em> Tex. Penal Code §§20.03 (kidnapping), 30.02\r\n(burglary), 29.02 (robbery), 22.021 (aggravated sexual assault), 28.02 (arson), 36.06\r\n(obstruction or retaliation), 22.07 (terroristic threat).  The Legislature could have included\r\nthe offense of \"escape\" in subsection (a)(2), or could have used the language \"in the\r\ncourse of committing or attempting to commit,\" in subsection (a)(4); however, it did\r\nneither.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Subsection (a)(4) does not speak of \"escape\" as an offense that must be committed\r\nor attempted, but rather as a factual circumstance to be proven, similar to circumstances\r\ndescribed in other subsections of the capital-murder statute.  <em>Compare</em> Tex. Penal Code\r\n§19.03(a)(4) (stating that the State must prove the murder was committed \"while escaping\r\n. . . from a penal institution\") <em>with</em> Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(5)(A) (indicating that the\r\nState must prove the murder was committed \"while incarcerated in a penal institution\"\r\nagainst one \"who is employed in the operation of the penal institution\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs evidenced by subsection (a)(2), the Legislature clearly knew how to specify\r\nthat commission of the offense of escape was a predicate offense for capital murder.  The\r\nLegislature's decision not to do so shows that they intended an application of the\r\ncommon-sense definition of \"escaping\" rather than the statutory definition of the offense\r\nof \"escape.\"  The phrase \"while escaping\" implies that the Legislature considered escape\r\nto be a process and desired to punish more severely any murder committed during that\r\nprocess.  We read words and phrases in context and construe them according to the rules\r\nof grammar and common usage.  Tex. Gov't. Code §311.011(a).  According to the rules\r\nof grammar and common usage, the process of escaping is not complete until the inmate\r\n\"get[s] away\" or is able to \"break away, get free, or get clear.\"  Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary 774.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplying the common-sense definition of \"escape,\" we hold that the evidence is\r\nsufficient to show that appellant killed Canfield while escaping from the Wynne Unit. \r\nThe facts show that Canfield was the \"high rider\" - a guard who patrolled just outside the\r\nprison fence.  It would have been obvious to the inmates in the squads that, in order to\r\nescape or \"get away,\" they would need to get past the high rider.  While appellant was\r\nmaking his escape with Falk, Canfield was attempting to prevent it.  In the course of their\r\nescape, appellant killed Canfield.  Although there is a point at which the escape is\r\nconcluded under subsection (a)(4), because appellant murdered Canfield while he was in\r\nthe literal process of escaping, we need not decide that point in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge did not err in overruling appellant's motion for a directed verdict. \r\nPoint of error one is overruled.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his second point of error, appellant contends that the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to show that he intentionally or knowingly caused Canfield's death.   In\r\nreviewing the legal sufficiency of appellant's intent to cause death, we note that capital\r\nmurder is a result-of-conduct offense.  <em>Roberts v. State</em>, 273 S.W.3d 322, 329 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 2008).  A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to a result of conduct\r\nwhen it is his conscious objective or desire to cause the result. Tex. Penal Code\r\n§6.02(a).  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to a result of his\r\nconduct, when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.  Tex.\r\nPenal Code §6.02(b).  An accused's intent can be inferred from his acts, words, and\r\nconduct.  <em>Dues v. State</em>, 634 S.W.2d 304, 305 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that he neither had a \"conscious objective or desire\" to cause\r\nCanfield's death nor was he \"aware that his conduct was reasonably certain\" to cause her\r\ndeath when the truck he was driving hit her horse.  First, appellant contends that the fact\r\nthat the horse was not significantly harmed by the truck shows that he did not intend to\r\nkill Canfield.  He notes that the veterinarian testified that the horse was put down because\r\nof the gunshot wound and not the truck impact, and asserts that the veterinarian testified\r\nthat the horse was not even harmed by the collision.  However, the veterinarian, Dr.\r\nPosey, did testify that the horse was harmed by the truck when he noted bruising or\r\ntrauma to the horse's left hip and scrapes to its hips and hock, along with a swollen joint\r\non its front left leg.  Posey also testified that it was not unusual for a horse to be able to\r\nwalk and have no broken bones after impact by a vehicle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNext, appellant argues that the horse was turning or circling when he hit it, and\r\nbecause the damage to the truck was on the right passenger side, he must have been\r\nturning away from the horse when he hit it with the truck.  He reasons that this evidence\r\nproves that he attempted to miss the horse because, if he wanted to kill Canfield, he\r\nwould not have turned the truck at all.  He also notes that he would have killed Falk, if\r\nFalk had not backed away.  He contends that the evidence shows that Canfield's death\r\nwas clearly just a tragic accident.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence shows that \r\nappellant and Falk worked together to effectuate their escape.  Canfield was the only\r\nobstacle to both men getting away.  Witnesses testified that once appellant began to drive\r\nthe truck, the engine was \"wide open,\" \"revved up at high rpms,\" and \"floorboarded,\" and\r\nit was headed straight toward Canfield.  Sergeant John Tucker, a Department of Public\r\nSafety (\"DPS\") accident reconstructionist, observed tire marks \"caused by a vehicle\r\naccelerating into a turn.\"  There was no evidence of braking or swerving near the point of\r\nimpact.  Further, the evidence showed that there was a clear space of over 40 feet on\r\neither side of Canfield into which appellant could have moved to avoid colliding with her. \r\nWhen appellant did turn, it was in the direction of the exit.  Based upon this evidence, the\r\njury could reasonably infer that, even if Canfield's horse was turning or circling, appellant\r\nintentionally or knowingly caused Canfield's death.  Point of error two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><em>Punishment Phase</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error three, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nregarding future dangerousness.  </span><span><em>See </em></span><span>Article</span><span> 37.071 § 2(b)(1).  </span><span>As with the guilt phase, in\r\nreviewing the sufficiency of the future-dangerousness evidence, we view the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact\r\ncould have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that the\r\ndefendant would commit criminal acts of violence.  </span><span><em>Williams v.

State</em>, 915\r\nS.W.2d 834, 843-44 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The evidence in the instant case revealed that appellant and Falk worked as a team\r\nto escape from the Wynne Unit.  While Falk drew fire from the guards, appellant obtained\r\na truck and then used it to incapacitate Canfield - the last guard impeding the duo's get\r\naway.  Appellant and Falk then led the authorities on a car chase, eventually abandoning\r\nthe city truck.  They then kidnapped a woman and took her vehicle.  When that vehicle\r\nwas no longer driveable, appellant engaged in a short gunfight with officers before\r\nfleeing on foot and hiding in the woods.  This evidence alone supports a finding of future\r\ndangerousness.  However, further evidence presented at the punishment phase also\r\nsupports this finding.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the time he killed Canfield, appellant was serving a 50-year sentence for\r\nattempted capital murder, a 40-year sentence for another attempted capital murder, a 10-year sentence for aggravated assault, and a 10-year sentence for failure to appear.  The\r\nvictims of the attempted capital murders and the aggravated assault were peace officers.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to appellant's prior offenses, the State offered evidence showing that\r\nappellant lacked remorse for the instant offense and felt that his conduct was not only\r\nreasonable but courageous.  Two weeks after Canfield's death, appellant sent a letter to\r\nhis older brother, John, in which he discussed the instant offense:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWell I'm sure by now that you have heard the news about my escape\r\nfrom the Wynne farm.  I wasn't gone for more than a few hours until I was\r\nrecaptured.  There was a shootout with the police, a couple of high speed\r\nchaces [sic], and a death.  You will never know the resolve, the desperate\r\ncourage it took for me to wrestle an armed guard off his horse - and take\r\nhis gun away frome [sic] him, while having three other armed guards on\r\nhorses shooting at you.  One of those three lost there [sic] life, and as a\r\nresult I now have to face the death penalty becaus [sic] of it.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tI do not expect you to fully understand my reasonings - you would\r\nhave to walk a mile in my shoes to understand what drove me to make such\r\na decision.  I exhausted every reasonable means of appealing my case -\r\nthrough the State - as well as through my own family, you encluded [sic]. I\r\nbegged you to speak to Robert Looper &amp; Jimmy Warnell [the officers he\r\nwas convicted of attempting to shoot].  For \"four\" years I have been\r\nreaching out to my family to help - It makes no difference now . . .  This is\r\nnot something that happen [sic] overnight John . . . surely in your heart you\r\nknew it would someday come down to this - what other choice did I have? \r\n25 years is a long-long time to do brother.  I barely had 12 done and the\r\nnext thirteen were overwhelming.  I did only what was to be reasonably\r\nexpected of me to do - win, loose [sic] or draw, I tried for freedom.  I lost. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t   I am a real outlaw brother.  My prison record speaks for its self [sic]. \r\nNow I'm gona [sic] die an outlaws [sic] death. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also called Stephen Rogers, employed by the TDCJ State Classification\r\nOffice, to testify about the classification levels in the Texas prison system and how an\r\ninmate's level is determined.  He described the layout, security measures, and privileges\r\nwith regard to general population and administrative segregation.  He testified that a\r\nperson receiving a sentence of life without parole would be assigned to the G-3 general\r\npopulation classification indefinitely.  However, he noted that due to appellant's escape\r\nrisk and the fact that he killed a guard, appellant would most likely be assigned to\r\nadministrative segregation and could remain there for the duration of his incarceration. \r\nRogers did note that inmates have committed acts of violence and escaped from\r\nadministrative segregation.  Texas Special Prosecution Unit Senior Criminal Investigator\r\nA.P. Merillat also testified about the level of security on death row and the newly defined\r\n\"High Security\" classification.  He noted that there were opportunities for inmates to\r\ncommit violence in all classification levels, including on death row, against fellow\r\ninmates, guards, chaplains, investigators, visitors, or medical personnel.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant presented the facts of his previous offenses of attempted capital murder\r\nthrough the testimony of witnesses.  On August 15, 1994, police were called to\r\nappellant's mother's home regarding a domestic disturbance with shots fired.  When\r\nDeputy R.D. McCommas arrived at the residence, he saw two or three people outside the\r\nhome.  As he approached, appellant got into a red truck and drove off.  The people at the\r\nhome confirmed that appellant was the one \"causing problems.\"  After determining that\r\neveryone at the house was unharmed, McCommas pursued appellant.  McCommas was in\r\na marked car with the lights and siren activated.  Two other county sheriff's cars and a\r\nDPS trooper became involved in the high-speed chase.  Appellant was going 60 to 70\r\nmph on a two-lane country road, and he drove through some yards adjacent to homes. \r\nMcCommas saw appellant waving a gun through the back window of the truck.  The DPS\r\ntrooper then took the lead in the chase and radioed that \"shots had been fired.\" \r\nMcCommas could see the trooper returning fire. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant eventually turned off the road into a maize field and positioned his truck\r\nso that it to faced back toward the road.  Appellant got out of the truck holding a gun to\r\nhis head.  A stand-off ensued that lasted several hours.  Other officers, sharp shooters,\r\nand police negotiators came to the scene, but, per policy, the officers were ordered not to\r\nreturn fire if appellant fired his weapon.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeputy Jimmy Warnell, a Collin County Sheriff's negotiator, attempted to get\r\nappellant to surrender and turn over his gun.  Warnell spoke with appellant while behind a\r\nbulletproof shield.  Appellant threatened to kill Warnell, and did fire a shot in close\r\nproximity to him.  Appellant fired other shots, one coming close to McCommas.  At one\r\npoint, appellant even put the gun into his own mouth.  Appellant was eventually arrested,\r\nand no one was harmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFollowing his arrest on August 15, 1994, appellant was released on bond which\r\nwas posted by his uncle.  However, appellant fled Texas and failed to make his court\r\nappearance.  Appellant was arrested in Kansas in 1997 and returned to Texas to face\r\ncharges for aggravated assault, two attempted capital murders, and failure to appear.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt punishment, Appellant also presented evidence regarding his childhood and\r\nfamily.  Appellant's brother, John, testified that appellant was the fourth of five children,\r\nhaving an older sister, two older brothers, and a younger sister.  When appellant was\r\nfairly young, their parents got divorced.   The children lived with their mother and moved\r\nseveral times.  They did not get to see their father very often due to animosity between the\r\nparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTami, the oldest, joined the Marines when she finished high school.  Joey, the\r\nsecond oldest, began having problems with drugs when he was in his teens and dropped\r\nout of school in the tenth grade.  After he quit school, Joey lived \"in ditches or in the\r\nwoods.\"  When Joey was 18 or 19, he died in a fire.  According to John, appellant was a\r\n\"happy go lucky kid\" prior to Joey's death, but John noticed a difference afterward.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen he was eleven, appellant attempted suicide by shooting himself.  When he\r\nwas in his early teens, he began using drugs.  John testified that appellant \"got out of\r\ncontrol with the drugs, and my mom shipped him off to dad.\"  Appellant did not finish\r\nhigh school.  John was aware that appellant was convicted of theft in Dallas County in\r\n1988, and was sentenced to shock probation, and attended boot camp.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJohn moved to Nevada with his wife in 1990 or 1991 and began working on a\r\nranch there.  Appellant also moved to Nevada and lived with John while working in a\r\ncasino as a cook.  John noted that appellant still had a problem with drugs and alcohol,\r\nand served jail time in Nevada.  Appellant committed the attempted capital-murder\r\noffense within 18 months of returning to Texas.  John testified that he never discussed the\r\n1994 incident with appellant, but his mother told him that appellant was threatening\r\nsuicide that day and had not threatened her life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJohn further testified about appellant's abilities as an artist.  TDCJ Captain John\r\nBolton testified that appellant worked for four or five years on the \"paint squad\" at the\r\nPolunsky Unit.  He confirmed that appellant was a talented artist and that he did some\r\nmurals around the prison.  He stated that appellant was one of the best painters ever to\r\nwork for him.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's father, Joe Martin, testified that he and appellant's mother never got\r\nappellant the help he needed to deal with his alcohol and drug problems.  Joe mistakenly\r\nassumed that the hospital would provide appellant with the help he needed following his\r\nsuicide attempt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEric Albritton, the appellate counsel for appellant's 1994 convictions, testified that\r\nhe believed appellant's trial counsel was ineffective because he did not raise evidence\r\nregarding appellant's mental condition.  Albritton believes that appellant was attempting\r\nto commit suicide by provoking the officers that day in the maize field.  Albritton\r\nadmitted, however, that he lost this argument on both appeal and petition for discretionary\r\nreview. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant presented his own prison-classification expert, Frank Aubuchon. \r\nAubuchon had been the former administrator of unit classification for TDCJ.  Aubuchon\r\ndetailed the type of restrictions and security present when an inmate is assigned to\r\nadministrative segregation.  He described the living environment, the restraints used to\r\ntransport an inmate assigned to administrative segregation, and the fact that the inmate\r\nwould remain handcuffed even during medical visits.  Aubuchon opined that appellant\r\nwould remain in administrative segregation for the rest of his life if he received a\r\nsentence of life without parole.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Dr. Roger Saunders, a forensic clinical psychologist, testified that\r\nappellant has major or \"severe\" depressive disorder that was first evidenced by\r\nappellant's suicide attempt at the age of eleven.  Saunders noted that appellant's medical\r\nrecords also showed that he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, mood disorder,\r\nsubstance-abuse disorder, and dependent personality features.  He stated that the\r\ndepressive disorder brought on appellant's alcohol and drug problems and probably\r\ncaused appellant to quit school.  He also testified that a severe depressive disorder can\r\ncause thoughts of doing things that are irrational and irresponsible.  However, Saunders\r\nalso testified that this depressive disorder is a very treatable illness and that appellant was\r\nreceiving treatment while incarcerated.  He also confirmed that there was no evidence in\r\nappellant's records that he was experiencing a depressive episode at the time of the\r\ninstant capital murder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that the future-dangerousness evidence should be outweighed by\r\nthe mitigating evidence he presented, plus the facts that Canfield's death was actually\r\nmore of a vehicular accident than an intentional murder, that he had not actually harmed\r\nanyone during his previous offenses, and that he had a good disciplinary record while\r\nincarcerated.<strong>  </strong>However, while this Court can review the objective evidence of future\r\ndangerousness, we do not review the jury's normative decision on mitigation.  <em>Colella</em>,\r\n915 S.W.2d at 845.  Nor do we weigh the aggravating versus mitigating factors. \r\n</span><span><em>McFarland v. State</em>, 928 S.W.2d 482, 497-98 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).</span><span>  Therefore, we\r\ndefer to the jury's conclusion that the mitigating evidence was not sufficient to warrant a\r\nsentence of life imprisonment.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe circumstances of the instant offense suggest that appellant's acts were\r\ncalculated and deliberate.  Given these facts, plus appellant's written admission that he is\r\nready and willing to use violence to get out of a lengthy prison sentence and the nature of\r\nhis previous offenses, we conclude that a rational jury could find that there is a\r\nprobability that appellant will commit criminal acts of violence that constitute a\r\ncontinuing threat to society.   Point of error three is overruled. \t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>JUROR MISCONDUCT</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error four, five and ten, appellant focuses on one specific act of\r\nalleged juror misconduct - juror Carrie Doak's negative response to question 79 of the\r\njuror questionnaire regarding whether she, a family member, or friend ever worked for the\r\nprison system, when, in fact, Doak's husband had worked as a guard and been stabbed by\r\nan inmate.  Specifically, in point of error four, appellant contends that Doak withheld\r\nmaterial information that denied appellant \"his right to intelligently exercise his\r\nchallenges resulting in him being denied a fair trial.\"  In point of error five, appellant\r\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for new trial\r\nbecause Doak's alleged \"material misrepresentation\" on the juror questionnaire \"resulted\r\nin the appellant being denied a trial [before] an impartial jury.\"  In point of error ten, he\r\nargues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial because Doak\r\ndiscussed this previously unrevealed information with the rest of the jury, thereby denying\r\nhim a fair trial before an impartial jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>A review of the record shows that, while filling out the juror questionnaire, Doak\r\nanswered the following question in the negative:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t79.\tHave you, a family member, or friend ever been employed, served in,\r\nor been a member of, any local, state, federal, or other law\r\nenforcement agency, including, but not limited to, any police\r\ndepartment, any Sheriff's Office, office of any District or County\r\nAttorney, Attorney General's office, or any prison system?<em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>During individual voir dire, appellant did not ask Doak whether she knew anyone who\r\nhad ever worked for the prison system.  Doak was accepted as a member of the jury.  We\r\nnote that two other prospective jurors with known connections to the Texas prison system\r\nwere accepted as jurors.  Juror Jerel Thornhill had formerly worked at the Limestone\r\nCounty Detention Center.  Counsel did not ask him whether he ever encountered violence\r\nduring his employment.  Juror Brenda Green indicated that, while she and her former\r\nhusband were married, he had been a Texas Department of Corrections (\"TDC\")<sup> (3)</sup> prison\r\nguard for 20 years, including \"working the death chamber.\"  Counsel did not question her\r\nregarding whether her former husband experienced violence on the job.  After the trial\r\nconcluded, it was learned that Doak's husband had been employed in the Texas prison\r\nsystem.  <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>Appellant filed a Motion for New Trial alleging in one of his grounds that Doak\r\nhad \"withheld material information\" at voir dire that denied him an impartial jury. \r\nAppellant relied upon the affidavit of juror Lori Ann Jenkins, in which she claimed that\r\nthe jury considered outside evidence during punishment deliberations.<sup> (4)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Specifically,\r\nJenkins stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMrs. Doak told the jury about an incident involving her husband.  She said\r\nthat her husband had worked in the Texas prison system and had been\r\nstabbed by an inmate while employed there.  As I recall, she said that her\r\nhusband had worked in Administrative Segregation when the stabbing\r\noccurred. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion for New Trial.  Nine of\r\nthe twelve jurors testified at the hearing as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Monica Cooke:\tCooke did not hear Doak have any discussions about a stabbing\r\nincident that involved her husband while he worked in TDC.  She\r\nwas not aware of any discussions by any members of the jury about\r\nany acts of violence that took place in TDC except those that were\r\nintroduced during the trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Jerel Thornhill:\tThornhill did not hear any discussions about anyone having any\r\npersonal experience regarding acts of violence in administrative\r\nsegregation or in TDC in general.  He specifically testified that he\r\ndid not remember any juror discussing his or her knowledge of a\r\nfamily member or friend being stabbed or subjected to any type of\r\nviolence while employed by TDC.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Carrie Doak:\t\tDoak testified that her husband had worked in administrative\r\nsegregation at the Ferguson Unit.  He was stabbed by an inmate once\r\nwhile on the job. He worked for TDC seventeen years ago, for a\r\nperiod of only eighteen months.  He did not think that the incident\r\nwas a \"big deal.\"  She did not discuss this at all during deliberations\r\nnor did she hear anyone else discuss it.  She noted that the only time\r\nthat it came up was \"three of us ladies were talking about our\r\nexperiences and what our husbands had done,\" when they were just\r\ngetting to know each other during the trial.  It was not a long or\r\ndetailed conversation.   The other ladies were \"Connie\" and \"Peggy.\" \r\nJenkins was not part of the conversation, but if Jenkins was around\r\nthem where she could hear, it is possible that Jenkins overheard it. \r\nDoak testified that the fact that her husband had been subjected to an\r\nassault in TDC had absolutely no impact on her deliberations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tRegarding the juror questionnaire, Doak testified that her incorrect\r\nresponse was an accident - she did not mean to answer the question\r\nincorrectly.  When filling out the questionnaire, she was in a rush to\r\nget to a doctor's appointment regarding her first grandchild.  She did\r\nnot even know that she answered it incorrectly until she was\r\ncontacted after the trial was over. The questionnaire was 23 pages\r\nand question 79 was long -  she is sure that she read the first three\r\nlines and did not see the last three or four words of the paragraph. \r\nAlso, the question did not mention TDC.  She was shocked that she\r\nwas selected for the jury and noted that had she been verbally asked\r\nduring voir dire, she would have told them her husband had worked\r\nin the prison system.  She stated that she lived in a small town and\r\nthe incident was public knowledge.  Doak knew half of the jury\r\n\"very well,\" although she did not know Jenkins.  She did note that\r\nshe and Jenkins had friends in common.  Also, when she realized\r\nthat some of the other jurors had experience with the prison system -\r\nsome up to 30 years and with death row - she thought that it must\r\nnot matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Brenda Green:\tGreen testified that her former husband worked for TDC and she had\r\ndiscussed that with counsel during voir dire.  During lunch one day,\r\nDoak mentioned that her husband had once worked at TDC and had\r\nbeen stabbed while working there.  The only other person that may\r\nhave been privy to the conversation other than herself and Doak was\r\n\"whoever was sitting besides us,\" but she could not remember who\r\nthat was.  Green testified that the incident was not discussed during\r\ndeliberations by anyone, nor does she remember anyone discussing it\r\nat any other time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Pegene Parker:\tParker never heard anyone discuss any specific instances involving\r\nacts of violence regarding their family members or themselves at\r\nTDC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Matthew Winn:\tWinn never had any knowledge about Doak's husband being stabbed\r\nwhile working at TDC.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Thomas Davis:\tDavis testified that he has known Mr. and Mrs. Doak for a long time.\r\nHe knew that Mr. Doak had worked for TDC and had at one time\r\nbeen the victim of a stabbing.  He did not hear anyone discussing this\r\nincident during deliberations.  He believes Doak mentioned that her\r\nhusband used to work for TDC when the jurors were casually getting\r\nto know one another in the first couple of days the jury was at the\r\ncourthouse.  He does not recall ever hearing Doak mention that her\r\nhusband had been stabbed.  He testified that even if someone had\r\nbrought up the incident during deliberations it would not have made\r\na difference because they had the evidence in the case - \"paperwork\r\nout in front of us that had stated what all goes on in [prison].\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>James Nash:\t\tAlthough Nash was the foreperson of the jury, neither appellant nor\r\nthe State questioned him regarding Doak or her husband.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Lori Jenkins:\t\tJenkins stated that Doak mentioned her husband and the stabbing\r\nincident shortly after they were convened as a jury.  She stated that\r\nDoak mentioned it over and over and some of the jurors talked about\r\nit a lot. She believed that this also occurred during jury deliberations. \r\nHowever, she also testified that this information had no influence on\r\nher own vote and she could not say how it influenced others.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error four, appellant contends that Doak purposefully withheld material\r\ninformation that her husband was employed as a prison guard and was stabbed by an\r\ninmate.  Appellant argues that because Doak withheld this material information, he was\r\ndenied the opportunity to exercise challenges intelligently, thus hampering his selection of\r\na disinterested and impartial jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note that both the Sixth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Texas\r\nConstitution provide criminal defendants the right to a trial by an impartial jury.  <em>Uranga\r\nv. State</em>, 330 S.W.3d 301, 304 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).  The protection under the Texas\r\nconstitution is no greater than that offered by the federal constitution.  <em>Jones v. State</em>, 982\r\nS.W.2d 386, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis Court has found that \"essential to the Sixth Amendment guarantees of the\r\nassistance of counsel and trial before an impartial jury is the right to question specific\r\nveniremembers in order to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges and challenges for\r\ncause.\"  <em>Franklin v. State</em>, 138 S.W.3d 351, 354 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)(citation omitted). \r\nAs well, \"where a juror withholds material information during the voir dire process, the\r\nparties are denied the opportunity to exercise their challenges, thus hampering their\r\nselection of a disinterested and impartial jury.\"  <em>Id. </em> However, it must be established that\r\nthe juror withheld the information during voir dire and that the information was withheld\r\ndespite the defendant's exercise of due diligence.  <em>Id.</em> at 355-56; <em>Jones v. State</em>, 596\r\nS.W.2d 134, 137 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980), <em>overruled on other grounds,</em> <em>Sneed v. State,</em> 670\r\nS.W.2d 262, 266 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Gonzales v. State</em>, 3 S.W.3d 915, 916 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), we specifically\r\naddressed, for the first time, \"the extent to which counsel may rely on information\r\nprovided in written juror questionnaires.\"  Prior to <em>Gonzales</em>, our cases addressing juror\r\nnon-disclosure were limited to the verbal-questioning portion of the voir dire process. \r\n<em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Franklin</em>, 138 S.W.3d at 352;  <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>897 S.W.2d 361, 362 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1995); <em>Jones</em>, 596 S.W.2d at 136.  In <em>Gonzales</em>, we considered a line of cases\r\nholding that purportedly material information is not deemed to have been \"withheld\"\r\nwhen defense counsel fails to ask sufficient questions during the voir dire process. \r\n<em>Gonzales</em>, 3 S.W<em>.</em>3d at 916.  When considering counsel's reliance on particular responses\r\nto a juror questionnaire, we held that \"'diligent counsel' will not rely on written\r\nquestionnaires to supply any information that counsel deems material.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 917.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs in <em>Gonzales</em>, defense counsel in this case did not ask any oral questions in an\r\neffort to verify whether prospective jurors had any connection to the prison system. \r\nFurther, even when a prospective juror answered question 79 in the affirmative, counsel\r\ndid not inquire during voir dire whether that person, her relative, or her friend\r\nexperienced violence while employed with the prison system.  Because counsel did not\r\nfollow up on the written questionnaire with more specific verbal questioning, it appears\r\nthat counsel did not consider this information to be \"material\" to the case.  We further\r\nnote that the information \"withheld\" by Doak does not rise to the level of information that\r\nwe have previously held to be material.  <em>See, e.g., Franklin</em>, 138 S.W.3d 351 (after stating\r\nthat she knew none of the parties involved in trial, juror informed court that she was the\r\nassistant leader of victim's Girl Scout troop and that her own daughter was also in the\r\nvictim's troop); <em>Von January v. State</em>, 576 S.W.2d 43 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978)(juror failed\r\nto disclose that he knew the deceased victim's family although asked directly during voir\r\ndire); <em>Salazar v. State</em>, 562 S.W.2d 480 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978)(in case where defendant\r\nwas on trial for exposing genitals to a young girl, juror failed to disclose that he had been\r\nprosecution witness in criminal proceeding where he was eyewitness to sexual assault of\r\nown daughter).  As Doak did not withhold material information, point of error four is\r\noverruled. <em> </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>In point of error five, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\ndenying his motion for new trial because Doak withheld material information that denied\r\nhim a trial before an impartial jury.<sup> (5)</sup>  A trial court's ruling denying a defendant's motion\r\nfor new trial is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>Salazar v. State</em>, 38\r\nS.W.3d 141, 148 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).

App. P. 44.2(b).<sup> (6)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record here supports a credibility determination that Doak remained an\r\nimpartial juror throughout appellant's trial.  Doak specifically testified that she was\r\n\"absolutely\" not influenced in her deliberations by the stabbing incident involving her\r\nhusband.  Notably, the incident occurred over seventeen years before and, at that time,\r\nDoak's husband did not consider the incident to be a \"big deal.\"  Because appellant\r\ncannot show Doak's verdict was affected by her husband's stabbing incident when he was\r\na guard, point of error five is overruled.<sup> (7)</sup>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span>In appellant's tenth point of error, he argues that the trial court erred in overruling\r\nhis motion for new trial because Doak discussed the stabbing incident with other jurors,\r\nthereby denying him a fair trial before an impartial jury.  He specifically points to the\r\ntestimony of Doak and jurors Green, Davis, and Jenkins.<span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Doak's presence on the jury did not unduly influence the\r\nother jurors.  Only jurors Green, Davis, and Jenkins testified that they knew or heard any\r\ninformation regarding Doak's husband.  Green and Davis testified that the incident\r\ninvolving Doak's husband was not discussed during jury deliberations and this was\r\nconfirmed by every other juror questioned at the motion for new trial hearing with the\r\nexception of Jenkins.  However, even Jenkins could not say that her knowledge of the\r\nstabbing incident influenced her deliberations or the deliberations of the other jurors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause appellant cannot show that Doak's presence as a juror denied him his\r\nright to an impartial jury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's\r\nmotion for a new trial.  <em>See Salazar</em>, 38 S.W.3d at 148.  Point of error ten is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">JURY CHARGE: GUILT PHASE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error six, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury instruction regarding \"escape.\"  Specifically, appellant requested that the\r\njury be instructed that escape is not a continuing offense, that an escape is complete when\r\nthe defendant \"moves beyond the bounds of his confinement without authority,\" and that\r\nif the jury had a reasonable doubt that the \"escape\" was completed before he hit Canfield\r\nwith the truck, then it must acquit appellant of capital murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tArticle 36.14 requires a judge to deliver to the jury \"a written charge distinctly\r\nsetting forth the law applicable to the case.\"  Here, appellant asserts that the law clearly\r\nstates that one completes the offense of escape when he crosses the property line of the\r\nprison in which he is confined.  Appellant relies upon the holdings in <em>Lawhorn v. State</em>,\r\n898 S.W.2d 886, 890 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995), and <em>Fitzgerald v. State</em>, 782 S.W.2d 876,\r\n881 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)<span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<span>As we stated in point of error one, the State did not have to prove the statutory\r\noffense of \"escape.\"  <em>See </em>point of error one, <em>supra.</em>; Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(4). \r\nTherefore, instructing the jury on the offense of escape as it pertains to the offense of\r\ncapital murder would have been error.  Further, we note that appellant misconstrues both\r\n<em>Lawhorn</em> and <em>Fitzgerald</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Appellant asserts that both <em>Fitzgerald</em> and <em>Lawhorn</em> hold that the offense of escape\r\nis completed once an inmate moves beyond the actual property line of the prison - in this\r\ncase, the fence surrounding the vegetable fields.  He relies on the following sentence in\r\n<em>Fitzgerald</em>:  \"Thus Appellant with his cohorts committed the felony offense of escape by\r\nmoving beyond bounds of Beto II Unit without authority, and his offense was complete at\r\nthat point.\"  782 S.W.2d at 879.  However, our <em>Fitzgerald</em> holding is limited to the facts\r\nof that case.  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, the defendant and another inmate cut through a perimeter\r\nfence unnoticed sometime before they were discovered missing at 7:00 a.m.  <em>Id.</em> at 877\r\nn.3.  In <em>Lawhorn</em>, the defendant escaped from a transport van.  Officer Waddle, the guard\r\nin the van, attempted to chase him but soon lost sight of him.  The defendant was later\r\nspotted by another officer and apprehended.  898 S.W.2d at 888.  We held under those\r\nfacts that the offense of escape was completed when the defendant left the \"state of\r\ndetention or restraint by a peace officer\" - when the defendant \"ran from the van, or at the\r\nvery latest, when Waddle gave up the chase and returned to the van containing her other\r\nprisoners.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 890.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Escape,\" for the purposes of section 38 of the Penal Code, is defined as an\r\n\"unauthorized departure from custody.\"  Tex. Penal Code §38.01(2). We have held that\r\nphrase to mean \"the act of leaving a state of detention <em>or</em><strong> </strong>restraint by a peace officer and\r\nonce the act is done the escape is accomplished.\"  <em>Lawhorn</em>, 898 S.W.2d at 890 (emphasis\r\nadded).  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, no guard attempted to prevent the inmates from leaving the prison,\r\nand so their escape was complete when they left the grounds.  <em>Fitzgerald</em> did not\r\ncontemplate a situation in which the inmates were confronted by guards while leaving the\r\nunit.</span> <span> In <em>Lawhorn</em>, the escape was complete when the defendant got away from the guard\r\nin the van.  </span>Therefore, even assuming that these cases defining the offense of escape\r\nunder section 38.01(2) have any applicability to appellant's case, they tend to show that\r\nappellant's escape was <em>not</em> complete at the time that he killed Canfield because he had not\r\nleft the effective restraint of a peace officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court did not err in refusing appellant's requested instruction as it would\r\nhave been a misstatement of the law.  Point of error six is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<span>In points seven and eight, appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to\r\ngive a lesser-included offense instruction on escape and by not providing appellant's\r\nproposed instruction on the lesser-included offense of escape in the court's jury charge. \r\nIn particular, he claims that escape is a lesser-included offense of capital murder under\r\nsection 19.03(a)(4), that he could have just been convicted of escape, as he lacked the\r\nrequired intent to commit murder, and that his instruction on the lesser-included offense\r\nof escape was proper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn deciding whether a defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense charge, we\r\nconsider all of the evidence introduced at trial, regardless of its source.  <em>Goodwin v. State</em>,\r\n799 S.W.2d 719, 740 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).  This Court applies a two-pronged test in\r\nits review.  <em>Rousseau v. State</em>, 855 S.W.2d 666, 672-75 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993);\r\n<em>Goodwin</em>, 799 S.W.2d at 740-41.  Under the first prong, it must be shown that the lesser-included offense is included within the proof necessary to establish the offense charged. \r\n<em>Id</em>.  The second prong then requires some evidence in the record that would have\r\npermitted a rational jury to find the defendant guilty of only the lesser-included offense. \r\n<em>Id</em>.  When making the determination of whether an instruction on a lesser-included\r\noffense should have been given, the credibility of the evidence, whether it conflicts with\r\nother evidence or whether it is controverted, may not be considered.  <em>Banda v. State</em>, 890\r\nS.W.2d 42, 60 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs held above, the offense of escape is not a lesser-included offense of capital\r\nmurder under section 19.03(a)(4) because the legislature was not using the term\r\n\"escaping\" to refer to the offense of escape; rather, they were using it in its common\r\nusage to describe a process.  <em>See</em> point of error one, <em>supra</em>.  Because the process of\r\n\"escaping\" is not an offense in and of itself, it is not within the proof necessary to\r\nestablish the charged offense.  Therefore, appellant does not meet the first prong of the\r\ntest.  <em>Rousseau</em>, 855 S.W.2d at 672-75.  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in\r\noverruling appellant's objection that a lesser-included offense instruction should have\r\nbeen given.  For the same reason, the trial judge also did not err in denying the appellant's\r\nproffered lesser-included offense instruction.<sup> (8)</sup>  Points of error seven and eight are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">PUNISHMENT DELIBERATIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error nine, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible\r\nerror by giving the jury a \"coercive\" instruction during punishment deliberations. \r\nAppellant argues this instruction denied him his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t Article 37.071 §2(g)<sup> (9)</sup> compels the trial court to enter a life sentence if the jury is\r\nunable to answer any special issue. <em> Howard v. State</em>, 941 S.W.2d 102, 121 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1996); <em>Montoya v. State</em>, 810 S.W.2d 160, 166 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).  However,\r\nthe trial court is not bound to enter a life sentence after the first sign of juror impasse.\r\n<em>Howard</em>, 941 S.W.2d at 121.  Rather, the court may do so if it determines, in its\r\ndiscretion, that the jury has been kept together for such a time as to render it altogether\r\nimprobable that it can agree.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also </em>Article 36.31.  When reviewing the trial court's\r\ndiscretion in this regard, this Court will consider the sheer length of the trial and amount</p>\r\n\r\n<p> of evidence presented to the jury.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Green v. State</em>, 840 S.W.2d 394, 407 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1992).     </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe record shows that the evidence in this case took eleven days to present and\r\ninvolved 43 different witnesses and 122 admitted exhibits.  Following closing arguments\r\nat punishment, the jury was sent to deliberate at 11:09 a.m.  At 2:37 p.m., the jury sent out\r\nthe charge with an attached note.  The jury had answered \"yes\" to special issue one and\r\nthe issue was signed by the foreperson on the verdict form.  Special issue two was not\r\nanswered, but the accompanying note stated:  \"On special issue #2 division is 9 no 3 yes. \r\nGuidance?\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argued that the jury had returned a final verdict because the jury was\r\ncomplying with the instruction on page four of the punishment charge which reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIf in considering Special Issue Number 2 the vote of the jurors is not\r\nunanimously \"NO\" or not at least ten (10) in favor of a \"YES\", then there\r\nshall be no answer for that Special Issue and the Jury Foreman should not\r\nsign his or her name to any answer form for that Special Issue Number 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Therefore, appellant asserted that the trial court must accept this as a final verdict and\r\nimpose a life sentence.  The trial court overruled the request and gave the jury the\r\nfollowing instruction:  \"Please continue to follow the court's instructions as contained in\r\nthe court's charge and continue to deliberate.\"  Appellant objected that this instruction\r\nwas coercive and that the jurors who answered \"yes\" to the second special issue would be\r\n\"bullied\" by the other jurors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt 3:24 p.m., the jury sent out another note regarding evidence of appellant's\r\nmental-health issues.  Appellant again reurged his objection and stated that \"we feel at\r\nthis point that deliberations are now becoming coercive in nature to try to get the three\r\nhold outs to change their verdict in order to give a death sentence to [appellant].\"  The\r\nState responded that there was no evidence of coercion and that the jury had barely started\r\ndeliberating as they had only been out for four hours and this was a long case.  The trial\r\ncourt again overruled appellant's objection, noting that there was nothing before him that\r\nwould lead him to the conclusion that \"any bullying was going on.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt 4:40 p.m., the jury sent out a third note requesting to have testimony read back\r\nto them.  Appellant again reurged his objection which the trial court again denied.  The\r\njury was recessed until the following afternoon at 1:00 p.m., so that the court reporter\r\ncould locate the requested testimony and one of the jurors could attend a funeral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWhen court reconvened the next afternoon, appellant again urged his objection to\r\nthe jury's continued deliberation.  The trial court overruled the objection.  The jury\r\nreturned its verdict at 3:15 p.m., having unanimously answered \"yes\" to the first special\r\nissue and \"no\" to the second special issue.  The jury was polled, and each juror answered\r\nthat this was his or her verdict.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant also raised this issue in his Motion for New Trial.<sup> (10)</sup>\r\n</p><p><span>  Appellant attached\r\nan affidavit by juror Jenkins wherein she stated that she and the other two jurors who\r\noriginally voted \"yes\" on the second special issue were harassed and bullied into\r\nchanging their answers.  She also stated that because the judge sent the case back to them\r\nto continue deliberating, she believed that the jury had to be unanimous on their answer\r\nbefore a verdict could be reached.  She stated that she would not have changed her vote to\r\n\"no\" had she not believed this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the motion for new trial hearing, Nash, the jury's foreman, testified that when\r\nhe sent the \"9-3\" note out, the jury had not yet taken a formal vote on the second special\r\nissue -  everyone had just expressed their initial opinions.  Nash was merely hoping that\r\nthe trial court would tell them to take a break for the rest of the day because it had been a\r\nlong trial and everyone was tired.  No juror - not even Jenkins - testified to changing his\r\nor her vote because of the trial court's instruction to continue deliberations.<sup> (11)</sup>    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court is not bound to declare a mistrial at the first sign of jury impasse. \r\n<em>Howard</em>, 941 S.W.2d at 121.  Here, the jury first asked for guidance from the trial court\r\nwhen it had deliberated for a period of less than three-and-a-half hours.  This trial\r\ninvolved a great deal of evidence:  43 witnesses and 122 exhibits, presented during eleven\r\ndays of guilt and punishment testimony.  The jury had obviously finished deliberating on\r\nthe first special issue, but there was no indication that they were finished deliberating on\r\nthe second special issue.  The note did not say the jury was deadlocked but merely stated\r\nthat their current \"division\" was \"9 no 3 yes.\"  The fact that the jury asked to see evidence\r\nand have testimony read back is further proof that they had not yet finished deliberating. \r\nThe trial court did not err when it instructed the jury to continue deliberations.  <em>See id</em>. at\r\n121-22 (trial court did not err giving instruction to continue capital-punishment\r\ndeliberations after jury note said they were \"deadlocked\" at 10-2 after eight hours of\r\ndeliberating); <em>Green</em>, 840 S.W.2d at 407 (trial court did not err in instructing jury to\r\ncontinue deliberations and overruling motion to impose a life sentence after jury sent\r\n\"deadlocked\" note after six-and-a-half hours of deliberating).

We have previously rejected these\r\narguments.  <em>See Blue</em>, 125 S.W.3d at 500-01; <em>Druery</em>, 225 S.W.3d at 509.

For the first time on appeal, appellant claims that Doak also withheld information \r\nregarding whether any member of her family had ever been the victim of a crime (Question 66 on\r\nthe juror questionnaire) because a stabbing is a criminal offense.

At the end of his argument, appellant briefly asserts that Doak was guilty of \"corrupt\r\nconduct\" by withholding material information on her questionnaire and cites to Texas Rule of\r\nAppellate Procedure 21.3(d).  Nowhere in his argument does appellant address how a juror's act\r\nof non-disclosure could amount to \"corrupt conduct\" within the meaning of Rule 21.3(d).\r\nWithout more, we will not evaluate this line of appellant's argument. <em> See </em>Tex.

Appellant argues that escape must be a lesser-included offense of capital murder\r\nbecause the trial court included the statutory definition of escape in the charge.  However, the\r\nstatutory definition was not applicable to the capital<span>-</span>murder charge but to the lesser-included\r\n\"murder in the course of another offense\" charge that appellant also received.  Appellant received\r\nthe following lesser-included offense charges: murder in the course of the commission of another\r\noffense (Tex. Penal Code §19.02(b)(3)), aggravated assault (Tex.

He and fellow inmate John Falk were\r\nassigned to the same work squad that morning to hoe and aerate the onion patch.  The\r\nWynne Unit onion patch is outside the main perimeter fence of the prison and adjacent to\r\nthe City of Huntsville Service Center (\"Service Center\").  The Service Center was, at that\r\ntime, separated from prison property by only a chain-link fence in some portions and a\r\nbarbed-wire fence in others.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Four squads had been turned out to work that day, each consisting of twenty\r\ninmates with a single armed guard on horseback.  Each guard carried a .357 revolver with\r\nsix bullets.  An armed supervising sergeant accompanied the squads in the fields.  Finally,\r\na \"high rider\" also patrolled the squads.  The high rider was another guard on horseback\r\nwho patrolled outside the prison fence on Service Center property and acted as the \"last\r\nline of defense\" in the event of an escape attempt.  The high rider carried a .357 revolver\r\nwith six bullets and a .223 rifle with four rounds.  The high rider that day was Officer\r\nSusan Canfield, an experienced rider and guard.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant was part of squad number five, which was assigned to work in the\r\nportion of the onion field closest to the Service Center.  Officer Joe Jeffcoat oversaw\r\nappellant's squad.  Falk was assigned to the row in their squad's section farthest from the\r\nfence, and appellant voluntarily took the row next to him.  Jeffcoat testified that appellant\r\nand Falk were friends and that they usually worked together.  He also noted that he had\r\nnever had any problems with the pair before that day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the squads had been working for a while, appellant approached Jeffcoat\r\nasked him to hold his watch because it had broken.  Jeffcoat agreed.  When appellant got\r\nabout 20 feet from him, Jeffcoat heard something to his left; he turned to see Falk\r\nwalking towards him from the other side.  When he turned back towards appellant,\r\nappellant was already at Jeffcoat's side reaching for his .357 revolver.  Appellant and\r\nJeffcoat began struggling over the gun, and Jeffcoat yelled for help.  Falk then started\r\nshoving Jeffcoat out of his saddle.  Appellant was able to get the gun as Jeffcoat came off\r\nhis horse on top of him.  Jeffcoat began to wrestle with appellant, but Falk came around\r\nand appellant tossed the gun to him.  Jeffcoat let go of appellant and started after Falk, but\r\nFalk pointed the gun at him.  At this time, Jeffcoat heard his superior, Field Sergeant\r\nLarry Grissom, yell to get down, so he did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant and Falk then fled through the barbed-wire fence and onto Service\r\nCenter property.  Grissom and the other guards focused on apprehending Falk because\r\nFalk had the gun.  Appellant ran off in another direction.  Grissom fired twice at Falk, but\r\nFalk ran behind some equipment.  Guards from two of the other squads also fired shots at\r\nFalk but to no avail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt this point, the high rider, Canfield, engaged in a gun fight with Falk.  Canfield\r\nadvanced on Falk while firing at him with her revolver.  When Canfield expended her\r\nbullets, Falk ran at her as she was trying to remove her rifle from its scabbard.  The two\r\nengaged in a struggle for the weapon while Canfield attempted to turn her horse away\r\nfrom Falk.  However, once Falk jabbed his stolen revolver in her ribs, Canfield ceased\r\nstruggling and Falk took the rifle.  Falk then backed away. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMeanwhile, during the gunfight, appellant ran to a truck parked outside the Service\r\nCenter sign shop.  Larry Horstman of the City of Huntsville sign shop testified that the\r\ntruck was a one-ton, flat-bed pick-up truck with toolboxes on the side.  He stated that he\r\nalways parked the truck about 10 feet from the sign shop door and left the keys in it. \r\nJeffcoat testified that he saw the truck parked in the same spot every time he was working\r\nin the onion field. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant got into the truck and sped straight towards Canfield.  Horstman\r\ntestified that he heard his truck take off \"real fast.\"  Other witnesses testified that the\r\ntruck was \"floorboarded,\" \"going as fast as it could go,\" \"being revved at high rpms,\"\r\nleaving acceleration marks as it hit Canfield and her horse just after Falk backed away. \r\nCanfield and the horse went up onto the hood of the truck.  Canfield's back and shoulders\r\nhit the windshield and her head struck the roof.  Canfield was then launched into the air\r\nand came down on her head, shoulder, and neck.  There was no evidence appellant tried\r\nto brake before hitting Canfield or that the truck slid into her and her horse; however, he\r\ndid turn toward the Service Center exit while, or immediately after, striking her with the\r\ntruck.  Witnesses also testified that there was enough room in the Service Center lot that\r\nappellant could have avoided hitting Canfield.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter striking Canfield and her horse, appellant stopped the truck and Falk ran to\r\nthe passenger side and got in.  Jeffcoat testified that they then \"took off as fast as the\r\ntruck could go.\"  Jay Miller, a fire hydrant technician with the Service Center, saw\r\nappellant take the truck and managed to follow it as it left the Service Center lot.  Miller\r\ncalled 9-1-1 and remained on the phone during the chase.  Miller testified that at one\r\npoint the truck's passenger sat up in the windowsill of the truck and pointed a rifle at him. \r\nMiller further testified that the passenger fired at him, but his vehicle was not hit.  Miller\r\ncontinued to chase them on and off the highway until the truck pulled into a parking lot\r\nand the inmates got out and ran into some nearby woods.  Miller parked his vehicle to\r\nblock the road and then chased the inmates on foot to see if they were going to come out\r\non the other side of a fence at the bank next door.  The police arrived at this time and\r\nMiller directed them towards the bank.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWalker County Deputy Brian Smallwood arrived at the bank to see appellant and\r\nFalk run to a red truck that was in the drive-thru lane.  Falk entered through the driver's\r\ndoor and shoved the female driver over.  Appellant, who now had the rifle, jumped into\r\nthe bed of the truck.  Huntsville Police Sergeant Ron Cleere also observed this and got\r\nout of his vehicle with his gun drawn, but the inmates drove off before he could attempt\r\nto stop them.  Cleere fired at the truck's tires seven times hitting one of them, but the\r\ntruck did not stop.  Both Smallwood and Cleere pursued the red truck.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFalk drove the truck onto the interstate but exited after only 3/4 of a mile.  He\r\npulled onto a grassy field next to some woods because the right front tire was shredded. \r\nSmallwood pulled his car into a ditch 50 yards away from the red truck.  Appellant stood\r\nup in the bed of the truck and pointed the rifle at Smallwood.  Smallwood heard a shot as\r\nhe opened his door.  Smallwood fired at appellant as appellant ran into the woods.  Cleere\r\narrived and fired at appellant as well.  Falk got out of the truck and also ran for the\r\nwoods.  Cleere saw appellant again on the edge of the woods, using the base of a tree to\r\nsteady the rifle.  Cleere went to retrieve his own rifle from his car, but when he returned\r\nhe did not see appellant.  Appellant then stood up and Cleere fired at him with his rifle,\r\nbut appellant got away.  When other officers arrived, they set up a perimeter around the\r\nwooded area.  The owner of the truck was unharmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHuntsville Police Lieutenant Daryl Slaven apprehended Falk behind the Walmart\r\non the other side of the wooded area.  When Falk heard the police car, he stopped and put\r\nhis hands in the air.  The authorities searched for appellant in the wooded area on\r\nhorseback and using dogs.  The rifle was found lying in the woods with three rounds still\r\nin it.  After approximately two hours, appellant's boots and some clothing were found\r\nhidden in the dirt of a creek bed.  Appellant was eventually discovered hiding in a tree\r\nwearing only his underwear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDallas County Medical Examiner Tracy Dyer testified that Canfield died from a\r\nsignificant impact that caused an unsurvivable hinge fracture to her skull which went\r\nfrom ear to ear. Viewing photos of the damage to truck, Dyer opined that it would have\r\ntaken a \"significant amount of velocity\" for Canfield's body to have caused the dent at\r\ntop of the windshield.  She noted that Canfield also sustained a depressed skull fracture as\r\nwell as external injuries including bruising and lacerations to her head, hands, arms,\r\ntrunk, and legs.  Veterinarian Richard Posey testified that Canfield's horse had extensive\r\ninjuries from a bullet wound, plus trauma to its left hip, scrapes on its hips and hock, and\r\na swollen joint on its front leg from the impact.  The horse had to be put down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appellant's first point of error, he complains that the trial court erred in\r\noverruling his motion for a directed verdict on the grounds that the evidence was legally\r\ninsufficient to show that Canfield's death occurred while he was escaping.  Specifically,\r\nhe asserts that Texas Penal Code §19.03(a)(4) incorporates the offense of escape,\r\npursuant to Texas Penal Code §38.06, and that case law dictates the offense of escape was\r\ncomplete when he went through the prison fence onto city property.  <em>See</em> <em>Lawhorn v.\r\nState</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432507/lawhorn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 890 (Tex.

Crim. App. 1990).<sup> (2)</sup>  For the reasons below, we find that the offense of escape\r\nfound in Texas Penal Code §38.06 is not incorporated into the capital-murder statute.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe provisions of the Penal Code must be \"construed according to the fair import\r\nof their terms, to promote justice and effect the objectives of the code.\"  Tex. Penal\r\nCode §1.05(a).  When attempting to discern the collective legislative intent or purpose of\r\na statute, we focus on the literal text of the statute and attempt to discern a fair and\r\nobjective meaning of the statute's text at the time it was enacted.  <em>Boykin v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443077/boykin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span>, 785 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).  </span><span>We focus on the text because it is the only\r\ndefinitive evidence of the legislators' intent and the Legislature is constitutionally entitled\r\nto expect the judiciary to faithfully follow the specific text that was adopted. <em> Id</em>. \r\nTherefore, if the meaning of the statute, when read using the canons of construction,\r\nshould have been plain to the legislators who passed it, then we give effect to that plain\r\nmeaning.  <em>Id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUpon examining the language of the capital-murder statute, it is apparent that\r\nwhen the statute requires proof of a predicate offense, it does so explicitly by using\r\nlanguage that the murder was done \"in the course of committing or attempting to commit\"\r\na specific offense.  <em>See</em> Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(2)(listing \"kidnapping, burglary,\r\nrobbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat\r\nunder Section 22.07(a)(1), (3), (4), (5), or (6)\" as offenses).  All of these predicate\r\noffenses are legislatively defined.  <em>See</em> Tex. Penal Code §§20.03 (kidnapping), 30.02\r\n(burglary), 29.02 (robbery), 22.021 (aggravated sexual assault), 28.02 (arson), 36.06\r\n(obstruction or retaliation), 22.07 (terroristic threat).  The Legislature could have included\r\nthe offense of \"escape\" in subsection (a)(2), or could have used the language \"in the\r\ncourse of committing or attempting to commit,\" in subsection (a)(4); however, it did\r\nneither.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Subsection (a)(4) does not speak of \"escape\" as an offense that must be committed\r\nor attempted, but rather as a factual circumstance to be proven, similar to circumstances\r\ndescribed in other subsections of the capital-murder statute.  <em>Compare</em> Tex. Penal Code\r\n§19.03(a)(4) (stating that the State must prove the murder was committed \"while escaping\r\n. . . from a penal institution\") <em>with</em> Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(5)(A) (indicating that the\r\nState must prove the murder was committed \"while incarcerated in a penal institution\"\r\nagainst one \"who is employed in the operation of the penal institution\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs evidenced by subsection (a)(2), the Legislature clearly knew how to specify\r\nthat commission of the offense of escape was a predicate offense for capital murder.  The\r\nLegislature's decision not to do so shows that they intended an application of the\r\ncommon-sense definition of \"escaping\" rather than the statutory definition of the offense\r\nof \"escape.\"  The phrase \"while escaping\" implies that the Legislature considered escape\r\nto be a process and desired to punish more severely any murder committed during that\r\nprocess.  We read words and phrases in context and construe them according to the rules\r\nof grammar and common usage.  Tex. Gov't. Code §311.011(a).  According to the rules\r\nof grammar and common usage, the process of escaping is not complete until the inmate\r\n\"get[s] away\" or is able to \"break away, get free, or get clear.\"  Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary 774.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplying the common-sense definition of \"escape,\" we hold that the evidence is\r\nsufficient to show that appellant killed Canfield while escaping from the Wynne Unit. \r\nThe facts show that Canfield was the \"high rider\" - a guard who patrolled just outside the\r\nprison fence.  It would have been obvious to the inmates in the squads that, in order to\r\nescape or \"get away,\" they would need to get past the high rider.  While appellant was\r\nmaking his escape with Falk, Canfield was attempting to prevent it.  In the course of their\r\nescape, appellant killed Canfield.  Although there is a point at which the escape is\r\nconcluded under subsection (a)(4), because appellant murdered Canfield while he was in\r\nthe literal process of escaping, we need not decide that point in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge did not err in overruling appellant's motion for a directed verdict. \r\nPoint of error one is overruled.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his second point of error, appellant contends that the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to show that he intentionally or knowingly caused Canfield's death.   In\r\nreviewing the legal sufficiency of appellant's intent to cause death, we note that capital\r\nmurder is a result-of-conduct offense.  <em>Roberts v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190790\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190790/roberts-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>, 329 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 2008).  A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to a result of conduct\r\nwhen it is his conscious objective or desire to cause the result. Tex. Penal Code\r\n§6.02(a).  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to a result of his\r\nconduct, when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.  Tex.\r\nPenal Code §6.02(b).  An accused's intent can be inferred from his acts, words, and\r\nconduct.  <em>Dues v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1622319\"><a href=\"/opinion/1622319/dues-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 305 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that he neither had a \"conscious objective or desire\" to cause\r\nCanfield's death nor was he \"aware that his conduct was reasonably certain\" to cause her\r\ndeath when the truck he was driving hit her horse.  First, appellant contends that the fact\r\nthat the horse was not significantly harmed by the truck shows that he did not intend to\r\nkill Canfield.  He notes that the veterinarian testified that the horse was put down because\r\nof the gunshot wound and not the truck impact, and asserts that the veterinarian testified\r\nthat the horse was not even harmed by the collision.  However, the veterinarian, Dr.\r\nPosey, did testify that the horse was harmed by the truck when he noted bruising or\r\ntrauma to the horse's left hip and scrapes to its hips and hock, along with a swollen joint\r\non its front left leg.  Posey also testified that it was not unusual for a horse to be able to\r\nwalk and have no broken bones after impact by a vehicle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNext, appellant argues that the horse was turning or circling when he hit it, and\r\nbecause the damage to the truck was on the right passenger side, he must have been\r\nturning away from the horse when he hit it with the truck.  He reasons that this evidence\r\nproves that he attempted to miss the horse because, if he wanted to kill Canfield, he\r\nwould not have turned the truck at all.  He also notes that he would have killed Falk, if\r\nFalk had not backed away.  He contends that the evidence shows that Canfield's death\r\nwas clearly just a tragic accident.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence shows that \r\nappellant and Falk worked together to effectuate their escape.  Canfield was the only\r\nobstacle to both men getting away.  Witnesses testified that once appellant began to drive\r\nthe truck, the engine was \"wide open,\" \"revved up at high rpms,\" and \"floorboarded,\" and\r\nit was headed straight toward Canfield.  Sergeant John Tucker, a Department of Public\r\nSafety (\"DPS\") accident reconstructionist, observed tire marks \"caused by a vehicle\r\naccelerating into a turn.\"  There was no evidence of braking or swerving near the point of\r\nimpact.  Further, the evidence showed that there was a clear space of over 40 feet on\r\neither side of Canfield into which appellant could have moved to avoid colliding with her. \r\nWhen appellant did turn, it was in the direction of the exit.  Based upon this evidence, the\r\njury could reasonably infer that, even if Canfield's horse was turning or circling, appellant\r\nintentionally or knowingly caused Canfield's death.  Point of error two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><em>Punishment Phase</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error three, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nregarding future dangerousness.  </span><span><em>See </em></span><span>Article</span><span> 37.071 § 2(b)(1).  </span><span>As with the guilt phase, in\r\nreviewing the sufficiency of the future-dangerousness evidence, we view the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact\r\ncould have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that the\r\ndefendant would commit criminal acts of violence.  </span><span><em>Williams v.

Crim. App. 1995).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The evidence in the instant case revealed that appellant and Falk worked as a team\r\nto escape from the Wynne Unit.  While Falk drew fire from the guards, appellant obtained\r\na truck and then used it to incapacitate Canfield - the last guard impeding the duo's get\r\naway.  Appellant and Falk then led the authorities on a car chase, eventually abandoning\r\nthe city truck.  They then kidnapped a woman and took her vehicle.  When that vehicle\r\nwas no longer driveable, appellant engaged in a short gunfight with officers before\r\nfleeing on foot and hiding in the woods.  This evidence alone supports a finding of future\r\ndangerousness.  However, further evidence presented at the punishment phase also\r\nsupports this finding.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the time he killed Canfield, appellant was serving a 50-year sentence for\r\nattempted capital murder, a 40-year sentence for another attempted capital murder, a 10-year sentence for aggravated assault, and a 10-year sentence for failure to appear.  The\r\nvictims of the attempted capital murders and the aggravated assault were peace officers.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to appellant's prior offenses, the State offered evidence showing that\r\nappellant lacked remorse for the instant offense and felt that his conduct was not only\r\nreasonable but courageous.  Two weeks after Canfield's death, appellant sent a letter to\r\nhis older brother, John, in which he discussed the instant offense:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tWell I'm sure by now that you have heard the news about my escape\r\nfrom the Wynne farm.  I wasn't gone for more than a few hours until I was\r\nrecaptured.  There was a shootout with the police, a couple of high speed\r\nchaces [sic], and a death.  You will never know the resolve, the desperate\r\ncourage it took for me to wrestle an armed guard off his horse - and take\r\nhis gun away frome [sic] him, while having three other armed guards on\r\nhorses shooting at you.  One of those three lost there [sic] life, and as a\r\nresult I now have to face the death penalty becaus [sic] of it.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tI do not expect you to fully understand my reasonings - you would\r\nhave to walk a mile in my shoes to understand what drove me to make such\r\na decision.  I exhausted every reasonable means of appealing my case -\r\nthrough the State - as well as through my own family, you encluded [sic]. I\r\nbegged you to speak to Robert Looper &amp; Jimmy Warnell [the officers he\r\nwas convicted of attempting to shoot].  For \"four\" years I have been\r\nreaching out to my family to help - It makes no difference now . . .  This is\r\nnot something that happen [sic] overnight John . . . surely in your heart you\r\nknew it would someday come down to this - what other choice did I have? \r\n25 years is a long-long time to do brother.  I barely had 12 done and the\r\nnext thirteen were overwhelming.  I did only what was to be reasonably\r\nexpected of me to do - win, loose [sic] or draw, I tried for freedom.  I lost. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t   I am a real outlaw brother.  My prison record speaks for its self [sic]. \r\nNow I'm gona [sic] die an outlaws [sic] death. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also called Stephen Rogers, employed by the TDCJ State Classification\r\nOffice, to testify about the classification levels in the Texas prison system and how an\r\ninmate's level is determined.  He described the layout, security measures, and privileges\r\nwith regard to general population and administrative segregation.  He testified that a\r\nperson receiving a sentence of life without parole would be assigned to the G-3 general\r\npopulation classification indefinitely.  However, he noted that due to appellant's escape\r\nrisk and the fact that he killed a guard, appellant would most likely be assigned to\r\nadministrative segregation and could remain there for the duration of his incarceration. \r\nRogers did note that inmates have committed acts of violence and escaped from\r\nadministrative segregation.  Texas Special Prosecution Unit Senior Criminal Investigator\r\nA.P. Merillat also testified about the level of security on death row and the newly defined\r\n\"High Security\" classification.  He noted that there were opportunities for inmates to\r\ncommit violence in all classification levels, including on death row, against fellow\r\ninmates, guards, chaplains, investigators, visitors, or medical personnel.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant presented the facts of his previous offenses of attempted capital murder\r\nthrough the testimony of witnesses.  On August 15, 1994, police were called to\r\nappellant's mother's home regarding a domestic disturbance with shots fired.  When\r\nDeputy R.D. McCommas arrived at the residence, he saw two or three people outside the\r\nhome.  As he approached, appellant got into a red truck and drove off.  The people at the\r\nhome confirmed that appellant was the one \"causing problems.\"  After determining that\r\neveryone at the house was unharmed, McCommas pursued appellant.  McCommas was in\r\na marked car with the lights and siren activated.  Two other county sheriff's cars and a\r\nDPS trooper became involved in the high-speed chase.  Appellant was going 60 to 70\r\nmph on a two-lane country road, and he drove through some yards adjacent to homes. \r\nMcCommas saw appellant waving a gun through the back window of the truck.  The DPS\r\ntrooper then took the lead in the chase and radioed that \"shots had been fired.\" \r\nMcCommas could see the trooper returning fire. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant eventually turned off the road into a maize field and positioned his truck\r\nso that it to faced back toward the road.  Appellant got out of the truck holding a gun to\r\nhis head.  A stand-off ensued that lasted several hours.  Other officers, sharp shooters,\r\nand police negotiators came to the scene, but, per policy, the officers were ordered not to\r\nreturn fire if appellant fired his weapon.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeputy Jimmy Warnell, a Collin County Sheriff's negotiator, attempted to get\r\nappellant to surrender and turn over his gun.  Warnell spoke with appellant while behind a\r\nbulletproof shield.  Appellant threatened to kill Warnell, and did fire a shot in close\r\nproximity to him.  Appellant fired other shots, one coming close to McCommas.  At one\r\npoint, appellant even put the gun into his own mouth.  Appellant was eventually arrested,\r\nand no one was harmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFollowing his arrest on August 15, 1994, appellant was released on bond which\r\nwas posted by his uncle.  However, appellant fled Texas and failed to make his court\r\nappearance.  Appellant was arrested in Kansas in 1997 and returned to Texas to face\r\ncharges for aggravated assault, two attempted capital murders, and failure to appear.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt punishment, Appellant also presented evidence regarding his childhood and\r\nfamily.  Appellant's brother, John, testified that appellant was the fourth of five children,\r\nhaving an older sister, two older brothers, and a younger sister.  When appellant was\r\nfairly young, their parents got divorced.   The children lived with their mother and moved\r\nseveral times.  They did not get to see their father very often due to animosity between the\r\nparents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTami, the oldest, joined the Marines when she finished high school.  Joey, the\r\nsecond oldest, began having problems with drugs when he was in his teens and dropped\r\nout of school in the tenth grade.  After he quit school, Joey lived \"in ditches or in the\r\nwoods.\"  When Joey was 18 or 19, he died in a fire.  According to John, appellant was a\r\n\"happy go lucky kid\" prior to Joey's death, but John noticed a difference afterward.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen he was eleven, appellant attempted suicide by shooting himself.  When he\r\nwas in his early teens, he began using drugs.  John testified that appellant \"got out of\r\ncontrol with the drugs, and my mom shipped him off to dad.\"  Appellant did not finish\r\nhigh school.  John was aware that appellant was convicted of theft in Dallas County in\r\n1988, and was sentenced to shock probation, and attended boot camp.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJohn moved to Nevada with his wife in 1990 or 1991 and began working on a\r\nranch there.  Appellant also moved to Nevada and lived with John while working in a\r\ncasino as a cook.  John noted that appellant still had a problem with drugs and alcohol,\r\nand served jail time in Nevada.  Appellant committed the attempted capital-murder\r\noffense within 18 months of returning to Texas.  John testified that he never discussed the\r\n1994 incident with appellant, but his mother told him that appellant was threatening\r\nsuicide that day and had not threatened her life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJohn further testified about appellant's abilities as an artist.  TDCJ Captain John\r\nBolton testified that appellant worked for four or five years on the \"paint squad\" at the\r\nPolunsky Unit.  He confirmed that appellant was a talented artist and that he did some\r\nmurals around the prison.  He stated that appellant was one of the best painters ever to\r\nwork for him.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's father, Joe Martin, testified that he and appellant's mother never got\r\nappellant the help he needed to deal with his alcohol and drug problems.  Joe mistakenly\r\nassumed that the hospital would provide appellant with the help he needed following his\r\nsuicide attempt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEric Albritton, the appellate counsel for appellant's 1994 convictions, testified that\r\nhe believed appellant's trial counsel was ineffective because he did not raise evidence\r\nregarding appellant's mental condition.  Albritton believes that appellant was attempting\r\nto commit suicide by provoking the officers that day in the maize field.  Albritton\r\nadmitted, however, that he lost this argument on both appeal and petition for discretionary\r\nreview. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant presented his own prison-classification expert, Frank Aubuchon. \r\nAubuchon had been the former administrator of unit classification for TDCJ.  Aubuchon\r\ndetailed the type of restrictions and security present when an inmate is assigned to\r\nadministrative segregation.  He described the living environment, the restraints used to\r\ntransport an inmate assigned to administrative segregation, and the fact that the inmate\r\nwould remain handcuffed even during medical visits.  Aubuchon opined that appellant\r\nwould remain in administrative segregation for the rest of his life if he received a\r\nsentence of life without parole.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Dr. Roger Saunders, a forensic clinical psychologist, testified that\r\nappellant has major or \"severe\" depressive disorder that was first evidenced by\r\nappellant's suicide attempt at the age of eleven.  Saunders noted that appellant's medical\r\nrecords also showed that he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, mood disorder,\r\nsubstance-abuse disorder, and dependent personality features.  He stated that the\r\ndepressive disorder brought on appellant's alcohol and drug problems and probably\r\ncaused appellant to quit school.  He also testified that a severe depressive disorder can\r\ncause thoughts of doing things that are irrational and irresponsible.  However, Saunders\r\nalso testified that this depressive disorder is a very treatable illness and that appellant was\r\nreceiving treatment while incarcerated.  He also confirmed that there was no evidence in\r\nappellant's records that he was experiencing a depressive episode at the time of the\r\ninstant capital murder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that the future-dangerousness evidence should be outweighed by\r\nthe mitigating evidence he presented, plus the facts that Canfield's death was actually\r\nmore of a vehicular accident than an intentional murder, that he had not actually harmed\r\nanyone during his previous offenses, and that he had a good disciplinary record while\r\nincarcerated.<strong>  </strong>However, while this Court can review the objective evidence of future\r\ndangerousness, we do not review the jury's normative decision on mitigation.  <em>Colella</em>,\r\n915 S.W.2d at 845.  Nor do we weigh the aggravating versus mitigating factors. \r\n</span><span><em>McFarland v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2413967\"><a href=\"/opinion/2413967/mcfarland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 497-98 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).</span><span>  Therefore, we\r\ndefer to the jury's conclusion that the mitigating evidence was not sufficient to warrant a\r\nsentence of life imprisonment.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe circumstances of the instant offense suggest that appellant's acts were\r\ncalculated and deliberate.  Given these facts, plus appellant's written admission that he is\r\nready and willing to use violence to get out of a lengthy prison sentence and the nature of\r\nhis previous offenses, we conclude that a rational jury could find that there is a\r\nprobability that appellant will commit criminal acts of violence that constitute a\r\ncontinuing threat to society.   Point of error three is overruled. \t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>JUROR MISCONDUCT</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error four, five and ten, appellant focuses on one specific act of\r\nalleged juror misconduct - juror Carrie Doak's negative response to question 79 of the\r\njuror questionnaire regarding whether she, a family member, or friend ever worked for the\r\nprison system, when, in fact, Doak's husband had worked as a guard and been stabbed by\r\nan inmate.  Specifically, in point of error four, appellant contends that Doak withheld\r\nmaterial information that denied appellant \"his right to intelligently exercise his\r\nchallenges resulting in him being denied a fair trial.\"  In point of error five, appellant\r\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for new trial\r\nbecause Doak's alleged \"material misrepresentation\" on the juror questionnaire \"resulted\r\nin the appellant being denied a trial [before] an impartial jury.\"  In point of error ten, he\r\nargues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial because Doak\r\ndiscussed this previously unrevealed information with the rest of the jury, thereby denying\r\nhim a fair trial before an impartial jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>A review of the record shows that, while filling out the juror questionnaire, Doak\r\nanswered the following question in the negative:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t79.\tHave you, a family member, or friend ever been employed, served in,\r\nor been a member of, any local, state, federal, or other law\r\nenforcement agency, including, but not limited to, any police\r\ndepartment, any Sheriff's Office, office of any District or County\r\nAttorney, Attorney General's office, or any prison system?<em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>During individual voir dire, appellant did not ask Doak whether she knew anyone who\r\nhad ever worked for the prison system.  Doak was accepted as a member of the jury.  We\r\nnote that two other prospective jurors with known connections to the Texas prison system\r\nwere accepted as jurors.  Juror Jerel Thornhill had formerly worked at the Limestone\r\nCounty Detention Center.  Counsel did not ask him whether he ever encountered violence\r\nduring his employment.  Juror Brenda Green indicated that, while she and her former\r\nhusband were married, he had been a Texas Department of Corrections (\"TDC\")<sup> (3)</sup> prison\r\nguard for 20 years, including \"working the death chamber.\"  Counsel did not question her\r\nregarding whether her former husband experienced violence on the job.  After the trial\r\nconcluded, it was learned that Doak's husband had been employed in the Texas prison\r\nsystem.  <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>Appellant filed a Motion for New Trial alleging in one of his grounds that Doak\r\nhad \"withheld material information\" at voir dire that denied him an impartial jury. \r\nAppellant relied upon the affidavit of juror Lori Ann Jenkins, in which she claimed that\r\nthe jury considered outside evidence during punishment deliberations.<sup> (4)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Specifically,\r\nJenkins stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMrs. Doak told the jury about an incident involving her husband.  She said\r\nthat her husband had worked in the Texas prison system and had been\r\nstabbed by an inmate while employed there.  As I recall, she said that her\r\nhusband had worked in Administrative Segregation when the stabbing\r\noccurred. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion for New Trial.  Nine of\r\nthe twelve jurors testified at the hearing as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Monica Cooke:\tCooke did not hear Doak have any discussions about a stabbing\r\nincident that involved her husband while he worked in TDC.  She\r\nwas not aware of any discussions by any members of the jury about\r\nany acts of violence that took place in TDC except those that were\r\nintroduced during the trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Jerel Thornhill:\tThornhill did not hear any discussions about anyone having any\r\npersonal experience regarding acts of violence in administrative\r\nsegregation or in TDC in general.  He specifically testified that he\r\ndid not remember any juror discussing his or her knowledge of a\r\nfamily member or friend being stabbed or subjected to any type of\r\nviolence while employed by TDC.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Carrie Doak:\t\tDoak testified that her husband had worked in administrative\r\nsegregation at the Ferguson Unit.  He was stabbed by an inmate once\r\nwhile on the job. He worked for TDC seventeen years ago, for a\r\nperiod of only eighteen months.  He did not think that the incident\r\nwas a \"big deal.\"  She did not discuss this at all during deliberations\r\nnor did she hear anyone else discuss it.  She noted that the only time\r\nthat it came up was \"three of us ladies were talking about our\r\nexperiences and what our husbands had done,\" when they were just\r\ngetting to know each other during the trial.  It was not a long or\r\ndetailed conversation.   The other ladies were \"Connie\" and \"Peggy.\" \r\nJenkins was not part of the conversation, but if Jenkins was around\r\nthem where she could hear, it is possible that Jenkins overheard it. \r\nDoak testified that the fact that her husband had been subjected to an\r\nassault in TDC had absolutely no impact on her deliberations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tRegarding the juror questionnaire, Doak testified that her incorrect\r\nresponse was an accident - she did not mean to answer the question\r\nincorrectly.  When filling out the questionnaire, she was in a rush to\r\nget to a doctor's appointment regarding her first grandchild.  She did\r\nnot even know that she answered it incorrectly until she was\r\ncontacted after the trial was over. The questionnaire was 23 pages\r\nand question 79 was long -  she is sure that she read the first three\r\nlines and did not see the last three or four words of the paragraph. \r\nAlso, the question did not mention TDC.  She was shocked that she\r\nwas selected for the jury and noted that had she been verbally asked\r\nduring voir dire, she would have told them her husband had worked\r\nin the prison system.  She stated that she lived in a small town and\r\nthe incident was public knowledge.  Doak knew half of the jury\r\n\"very well,\" although she did not know Jenkins.  She did note that\r\nshe and Jenkins had friends in common.  Also, when she realized\r\nthat some of the other jurors had experience with the prison system -\r\nsome up to 30 years and with death row - she thought that it must\r\nnot matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Brenda Green:\tGreen testified that her former husband worked for TDC and she had\r\ndiscussed that with counsel during voir dire.  During lunch one day,\r\nDoak mentioned that her husband had once worked at TDC and had\r\nbeen stabbed while working there.  The only other person that may\r\nhave been privy to the conversation other than herself and Doak was\r\n\"whoever was sitting besides us,\" but she could not remember who\r\nthat was.  Green testified that the incident was not discussed during\r\ndeliberations by anyone, nor does she remember anyone discussing it\r\nat any other time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Pegene Parker:\tParker never heard anyone discuss any specific instances involving\r\nacts of violence regarding their family members or themselves at\r\nTDC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Matthew Winn:\tWinn never had any knowledge about Doak's husband being stabbed\r\nwhile working at TDC.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Thomas Davis:\tDavis testified that he has known Mr. and Mrs. Doak for a long time.\r\nHe knew that Mr. Doak had worked for TDC and had at one time\r\nbeen the victim of a stabbing.  He did not hear anyone discussing this\r\nincident during deliberations.  He believes Doak mentioned that her\r\nhusband used to work for TDC when the jurors were casually getting\r\nto know one another in the first couple of days the jury was at the\r\ncourthouse.  He does not recall ever hearing Doak mention that her\r\nhusband had been stabbed.  He testified that even if someone had\r\nbrought up the incident during deliberations it would not have made\r\na difference because they had the evidence in the case - \"paperwork\r\nout in front of us that had stated what all goes on in [prison].\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>James Nash:\t\tAlthough Nash was the foreperson of the jury, neither appellant nor\r\nthe State questioned him regarding Doak or her husband.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Lori Jenkins:\t\tJenkins stated that Doak mentioned her husband and the stabbing\r\nincident shortly after they were convened as a jury.  She stated that\r\nDoak mentioned it over and over and some of the jurors talked about\r\nit a lot. She believed that this also occurred during jury deliberations. \r\nHowever, she also testified that this information had no influence on\r\nher own vote and she could not say how it influenced others.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error four, appellant contends that Doak purposefully withheld material\r\ninformation that her husband was employed as a prison guard and was stabbed by an\r\ninmate.  Appellant argues that because Doak withheld this material information, he was\r\ndenied the opportunity to exercise challenges intelligently, thus hampering his selection of\r\na disinterested and impartial jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note that both the Sixth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Texas\r\nConstitution provide criminal defendants the right to a trial by an impartial jury.  <em>Uranga\r\nv.

In <em>Gonzales</em>, we considered a line of cases\r\nholding that purportedly material information is not deemed to have been \"withheld\"\r\nwhen defense counsel fails to ask sufficient questions during the voir dire process. \r\n<em>Gonzales</em>, 3 S.W<em>.</em>3d at 916.

Because counsel did not\r\nfollow up on the written questionnaire with more specific verbal questioning, it appears\r\nthat counsel did not consider this information to be \"material\" to the case.

Doak specifically testified that she was\r\n\"absolutely\" not influenced in her deliberations by the stabbing incident involving her\r\nhusband.  Notably, the incident occurred over seventeen years before and, at that time,\r\nDoak's husband did not consider the incident to be a \"big deal.\"  Because appellant\r\ncannot show Doak's verdict was affected by her husband's stabbing incident when he was\r\na guard, point of error five is overruled.<sup> (7)</sup>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span>In appellant's tenth point of error, he argues that the trial court erred in overruling\r\nhis motion for new trial because Doak discussed the stabbing incident with other jurors,\r\nthereby denying him a fair trial before an impartial jury.  He specifically points to the\r\ntestimony of Doak and jurors Green, Davis, and Jenkins.<span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe record shows that Doak's presence on the jury did not unduly influence the\r\nother jurors.  Only jurors Green, Davis, and Jenkins testified that they knew or heard any\r\ninformation regarding Doak's husband.  Green and Davis testified that the incident\r\ninvolving Doak's husband was not discussed during jury deliberations and this was\r\nconfirmed by every other juror questioned at the motion for new trial hearing with the\r\nexception of Jenkins.  However, even Jenkins could not say that her knowledge of the\r\nstabbing incident influenced her deliberations or the deliberations of the other jurors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause appellant cannot show that Doak's presence as a juror denied him his\r\nright to an impartial jury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's\r\nmotion for a new trial.  <em>See Salazar</em>, 38 S.W.3d at 148.  Point of error ten is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">JURY CHARGE: GUILT PHASE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error six, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequested jury instruction regarding \"escape.\"  Specifically, appellant requested that the\r\njury be instructed that escape is not a continuing offense, that an escape is complete when\r\nthe defendant \"moves beyond the bounds of his confinement without authority,\" and that\r\nif the jury had a reasonable doubt that the \"escape\" was completed before he hit Canfield\r\nwith the truck, then it must acquit appellant of capital murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tArticle 36.14 requires a judge to deliver to the jury \"a written charge distinctly\r\nsetting forth the law applicable to the case.\"  Here, appellant asserts that the law clearly\r\nstates that one completes the offense of escape when he crosses the property line of the\r\nprison in which he is confined.  Appellant relies upon the holdings in <em>Lawhorn v. State</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432507/lawhorn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 890 (Tex.

Crim. App. 1990)<span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<span>As we stated in point of error one, the State did not have to prove the statutory\r\noffense of \"escape.\"  <em>See </em>point of error one, <em>supra.</em>; Tex. Penal Code §19.03(a)(4). \r\nTherefore, instructing the jury on the offense of escape as it pertains to the offense of\r\ncapital murder would have been error.  Further, we note that appellant misconstrues both\r\n<em>Lawhorn</em> and <em>Fitzgerald</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Appellant asserts that both <em>Fitzgerald</em> and <em>Lawhorn</em> hold that the offense of escape\r\nis completed once an inmate moves beyond the actual property line of the prison - in this\r\ncase, the fence surrounding the vegetable fields.  He relies on the following sentence in\r\n<em>Fitzgerald</em>:  \"Thus Appellant with his cohorts committed the felony offense of escape by\r\nmoving beyond bounds of Beto II Unit without authority, and his offense was complete at\r\nthat point.\"  782 S.W.2d at 879.  However, our <em>Fitzgerald</em> holding is limited to the facts\r\nof that case.  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, the defendant and another inmate cut through a perimeter\r\nfence unnoticed sometime before they were discovered missing at 7:00 a.m.  <em>Id.</em> at 877\r\nn.3.  In <em>Lawhorn</em>, the defendant escaped from a transport van.  Officer Waddle, the guard\r\nin the van, attempted to chase him but soon lost sight of him.  The defendant was later\r\nspotted by another officer and apprehended.  898 S.W.2d at 888.  We held under those\r\nfacts that the offense of escape was completed when the defendant left the \"state of\r\ndetention or restraint by a peace officer\" - when the defendant \"ran from the van, or at the\r\nvery latest, when Waddle gave up the chase and returned to the van containing her other\r\nprisoners.\"  <em>Id</em>. at 890.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Escape,\" for the purposes of section 38 of the Penal Code, is defined as an\r\n\"unauthorized departure from custody.\"  Tex. Penal Code §38.01(2). We have held that\r\nphrase to mean \"the act of leaving a state of detention <em>or</em><strong> </strong>restraint by a peace officer and\r\nonce the act is done the escape is accomplished.\"  <em>Lawhorn</em>, 898 S.W.2d at 890 (emphasis\r\nadded).  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, no guard attempted to prevent the inmates from leaving the prison,\r\nand so their escape was complete when they left the grounds.  <em>Fitzgerald</em> did not\r\ncontemplate a situation in which the inmates were confronted by guards while leaving the\r\nunit.</span> <span> In <em>Lawhorn</em>, the escape was complete when the defendant got away from the guard\r\nin the van.  </span>Therefore, even assuming that these cases defining the offense of escape\r\nunder section 38.01(2) have any applicability to appellant's case, they tend to show that\r\nappellant's escape was <em>not</em> complete at the time that he killed Canfield because he had not\r\nleft the effective restraint of a peace officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court did not err in refusing appellant's requested instruction as it would\r\nhave been a misstatement of the law.  Point of error six is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<span>In points seven and eight, appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to\r\ngive a lesser-included offense instruction on escape and by not providing appellant's\r\nproposed instruction on the lesser-included offense of escape in the court's jury charge. \r\nIn particular, he claims that escape is a lesser-included offense of capital murder under\r\nsection 19.03(a)(4), that he could have just been convicted of escape, as he lacked the\r\nrequired intent to commit murder, and that his instruction on the lesser-included offense\r\nof escape was proper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn deciding whether a defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense charge, we\r\nconsider all of the evidence introduced at trial, regardless of its source.  <em>Goodwin v. State</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381108\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381108/goodwin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 740 (Tex.

Crim. App. 1993);\r\n<em>Goodwin</em>, 799 S.W.2d at 740-41.  Under the first prong, it must be shown that the lesser-included offense is included within the proof necessary to establish the offense charged. \r\n<em>Id</em>.  The second prong then requires some evidence in the record that would have\r\npermitted a rational jury to find the defendant guilty of only the lesser-included offense. \r\n<em>Id</em>.  When making the determination of whether an instruction on a lesser-included\r\noffense should have been given, the credibility of the evidence, whether it conflicts with\r\nother evidence or whether it is controverted, may not be considered.  <em>Banda v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2394754\"><a href=\"/opinion/2394754/banda-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 60 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs held above, the offense of escape is not a lesser-included offense of capital\r\nmurder under section 19.03(a)(4) because the legislature was not using the term\r\n\"escaping\" to refer to the offense of escape; rather, they were using it in its common\r\nusage to describe a process.  <em>See</em> point of error one, <em>supra</em>.  Because the process of\r\n\"escaping\" is not an offense in and of itself, it is not within the proof necessary to\r\nestablish the charged offense.  Therefore, appellant does not meet the first prong of the\r\ntest.  <em>Rousseau</em>, 855 S.W.2d at 672-75.  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in\r\noverruling appellant's objection that a lesser-included offense instruction should have\r\nbeen given.  For the same reason, the trial judge also did not err in denying the appellant's\r\nproffered lesser-included offense instruction.<sup> (8)</sup>  Points of error seven and eight are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">PUNISHMENT DELIBERATIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error nine, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible\r\nerror by giving the jury a \"coercive\" instruction during punishment deliberations. \r\nAppellant argues this instruction denied him his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t Article 37.071 §2(g)<sup> (9)</sup> compels the trial court to enter a life sentence if the jury is\r\nunable to answer any special issue. <em> Howard v.

Rather, the court may do so if it determines, in its\r\ndiscretion, that the jury has been kept together for such a time as to render it altogether\r\nimprobable that it can agree.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also </em>Article 36.31.

Crim.\r\nApp. 1992).     </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe record shows that the evidence in this case took eleven days to present and\r\ninvolved 43 different witnesses and 122 admitted exhibits.  Following closing arguments\r\nat punishment, the jury was sent to deliberate at 11:09 a.m.  At 2:37 p.m., the jury sent out\r\nthe charge with an attached note.  The jury had answered \"yes\" to special issue one and\r\nthe issue was signed by the foreperson on the verdict form.  Special issue two was not\r\nanswered, but the accompanying note stated:  \"On special issue #2 division is 9 no 3 yes. \r\nGuidance?\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argued that the jury had returned a final verdict because the jury was\r\ncomplying with the instruction on page four of the punishment charge which reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIf in considering Special Issue Number 2 the vote of the jurors is not\r\nunanimously \"NO\" or not at least ten (10) in favor of a \"YES\", then there\r\nshall be no answer for that Special Issue and the Jury Foreman should not\r\nsign his or her name to any answer form for that Special Issue Number 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Therefore, appellant asserted that the trial court must accept this as a final verdict and\r\nimpose a life sentence.  The trial court overruled the request and gave the jury the\r\nfollowing instruction:  \"Please continue to follow the court's instructions as contained in\r\nthe court's charge and continue to deliberate.\"  Appellant objected that this instruction\r\nwas coercive and that the jurors who answered \"yes\" to the second special issue would be\r\n\"bullied\" by the other jurors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt 3:24 p.m., the jury sent out another note regarding evidence of appellant's\r\nmental-health issues.  Appellant again reurged his objection and stated that \"we feel at\r\nthis point that deliberations are now becoming coercive in nature to try to get the three\r\nhold outs to change their verdict in order to give a death sentence to [appellant].\"  The\r\nState responded that there was no evidence of coercion and that the jury had barely started\r\ndeliberating as they had only been out for four hours and this was a long case.  The trial\r\ncourt again overruled appellant's objection, noting that there was nothing before him that\r\nwould lead him to the conclusion that \"any bullying was going on.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAt 4:40 p.m., the jury sent out a third note requesting to have testimony read back\r\nto them.  Appellant again reurged his objection which the trial court again denied.  The\r\njury was recessed until the following afternoon at 1:00 p.m., so that the court reporter\r\ncould locate the requested testimony and one of the jurors could attend a funeral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWhen court reconvened the next afternoon, appellant again urged his objection to\r\nthe jury's continued deliberation.  The trial court overruled the objection.  The jury\r\nreturned its verdict at 3:15 p.m., having unanimously answered \"yes\" to the first special\r\nissue and \"no\" to the second special issue.  The jury was polled, and each juror answered\r\nthat this was his or her verdict.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant also raised this issue in his Motion for New Trial.<sup> (10)</sup>\r\n</p><p><span>  Appellant attached\r\nan affidavit by juror Jenkins wherein she stated that she and the other two jurors who\r\noriginally voted \"yes\" on the second special issue were harassed and bullied into\r\nchanging their answers.  She also stated that because the judge sent the case back to them\r\nto continue deliberating, she believed that the jury had to be unanimous on their answer\r\nbefore a verdict could be reached.  She stated that she would not have changed her vote to\r\n\"no\" had she not believed this.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the motion for new trial hearing, Nash, the jury's foreman, testified that when\r\nhe sent the \"9-3\" note out, the jury had not yet taken a formal vote on the second special\r\nissue -  everyone had just expressed their initial opinions.  Nash was merely hoping that\r\nthe trial court would tell them to take a break for the rest of the day because it had been a\r\nlong trial and everyone was tired.  No juror - not even Jenkins - testified to changing his\r\nor her vote because of the trial court's instruction to continue deliberations.<sup> (11)</sup>    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court is not bound to declare a mistrial at the first sign of jury impasse. \r\n<em>Howard</em>, 941 S.W.2d at 121.  Here, the jury first asked for guidance from the trial court\r\nwhen it had deliberated for a period of less than three-and-a-half hours.  This trial\r\ninvolved a great deal of evidence:  43 witnesses and 122 exhibits, presented during eleven\r\ndays of guilt and punishment testimony.  The jury had obviously finished deliberating on\r\nthe first special issue, but there was no indication that they were finished deliberating on\r\nthe second special issue.  The note did not say the jury was deadlocked but merely stated\r\nthat their current \"division\" was \"9 no 3 yes.\"  The fact that the jury asked to see evidence\r\nand have testimony read back is further proof that they had not yet finished deliberating. \r\nThe trial court did not err when it instructed the jury to continue deliberations.  <em>See id</em>. at\r\n121-22 (trial court did not err giving instruction to continue capital-punishment\r\ndeliberations after jury note said they were \"deadlocked\" at 10-2 after eight hours of\r\ndeliberating); <em>Green</em>, 840 S.W.2d at 407 (trial court did not err in instructing jury to\r\ncontinue deliberations and overruling motion to impose a life sentence after jury sent\r\n\"deadlocked\" note after six-and-a-half hours of deliberating).

Points of error eleven, twelve, and thirteen are overruled.</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TEXAS DEATH PENALTY<span>\tIn points of error fourteen and fifteen, appellant argues that the Texas capital-sentencing scheme is unconstitutional because it fails to assign a burden of proof on the\r\nmitigation special issue and that the trial court erred in rejecting his request for an\r\ninstruction assigning the burden to the State.  We have previously rejected these\r\narguments.  <em>See Blue</em>, 125 S.W.3d at 500-01; <em>Druery</em>, 225 S.W.3d at 509.  Further, this\r\nCourt has held that the mitigation special issue is a defensive issue for which the State has\r\nno burden of proof.  <em>Williams v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190742\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190742/williams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 221-22 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).  \r\nPoints of error fourteen and fifteen are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error sixteen, appellant posits that the mitigation issue is\r\nunconstitutional because meaningful appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence is\r\nimpossible.  We have previously rejected the claim that the issue violates the constitution\r\nbecause it deprives a defendant of \"meaningful appellate review.\" <em> Russeau</em></span><span><em> v.

Crim. App. 1996).  Point of error\r\nsixteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<span>In appellant's seventeenth and eighteenth points of error, he argues that the \"12-10\r\nrule\" of Article 37.071, which requires at least ten votes for the jury to return a negative\r\nanswer to the first special issue and at least ten votes for the jury to return an affirmative\r\nanswer to the second special issue, violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution.  We have repeatedly rejected identical claims.  <em>Russeau</em>, 171 S.W.3d at 886;\r\n<em>Lawton v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span>, 558-59 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).  In point of error\r\nnineteen, appellant further posits that the \"12-10 rule\" violates his Sixth Amendment right\r\nto an impartial jury.  Appellant presents no argument or authority applying the Sixth\r\nAmendment to this provision of Article 37.071; therefore, this issue is inadequately\r\nbriefed.  </span><span><em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(I)</span><span>.  Points of error seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen are\r\noverruled.</span></p><center></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFinally, in his twentieth point of error, appellant <span>contends that Article 37.071\r\nviolates the Eighth Amendment because it fails to require that jurors be informed that a\r\nsingle holdout juror on any special issue will result in an automatic life sentence.  We\r\nhave previously decided this issue adversely to appellant.  <em>Russeau</em>, 171 S.W.3d at 886;\r\n<em>Shannon v.

Unless otherwise indicated all references to Articles refer to the Code of Criminal\r\nProcedure.\r\n</p><p>2.   <em>See</em> discussion of <em>Lawhorn</em> and <em>Fitzgerald</em> in point of error six, <em>infra.</em>\r\n</p><p>3.   TDC was later renamed the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\r\n</p><p>4.   Texas Rule of Evidence Rule 606(b) states that a juror may not testify or make\r\nan affidavit about any matter or statement occurring during deliberations or the effects of\r\nanything on any juror's mind as influencing the verdict with two exceptions:  (1)\r\n\"whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror,\" or (2) \"to\r\nrebut a claim that the juror was not qualified to serve.\"  In points of error four, five, nine,\r\nand ten, appellant relies upon an affidavit and testimony obtained during the hearing on\r\nthe Motion for New Trial that implicate Rule 606(b).  Neither party objected to the use of\r\nthis evidence. </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe express no opinion as to whether the admittance of this evidence was proper;\r\nhowever, as no objections were lodged, the testimony and affidavits of the jurors are\r\navailable for our consideration in determining whether reversible error occurred.  <em>See\r\nSalazar v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103770/salazar-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 147 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); <em>see also McQuarrie v.\r\nState</em>, No. PD-0803-11,</span><span> slip op. at 9-18, ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 10, 2012).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.   For the first time on appeal, appellant claims that Doak also withheld information \r\nregarding whether any member of her family had ever been the victim of a crime (Question 66 on\r\nthe juror questionnaire) because a stabbing is a criminal offense.  Appellant has not preserved\r\nthis claim for appellate review.  Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). \r\n</p><p>6.   <em>Cf. Franklin</em>, 138 S.W.3d at 354-58 (harm will be reviewed under Texas Rule of\r\nAppellate Procedure 44.2(a) for constitutional error where information withheld is material and\r\ncounsel was diligent in trying to elicit the information).\r\n</p><p>7.   At the end of his argument, appellant briefly asserts that Doak was guilty of \"corrupt\r\nconduct\" by withholding material information on her questionnaire and cites to Texas Rule of\r\nAppellate Procedure 21.3(d).  Nowhere in his argument does appellant address how a juror's act\r\nof non-disclosure could amount to \"corrupt conduct\" within the meaning of Rule 21.3(d).\r\nWithout more, we will not evaluate this line of appellant's argument. <em> See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n38.1(I).  \r\n</p><p>8.   Appellant argues that escape must be a lesser-included offense of capital murder\r\nbecause the trial court included the statutory definition of escape in the charge.  However, the\r\nstatutory definition was not applicable to the capital<span>-</span>murder charge but to the lesser-included\r\n\"murder in the course of another offense\" charge that appellant also received.  Appellant received\r\nthe following lesser-included offense charges: murder in the course of the commission of another\r\noffense (Tex. Penal Code §19.02(b)(3)), aggravated assault (Tex. Penal Code §22.02(a)),\r\nmanslaughter (Tex. Penal Code §19.04), and criminally negligent homicide (Tex. Penal Code\r\n§19.05).\r\n</p><p>9.   Formerly codified as Article 37.071 §2(e).  <em>Howard</em> discusses the former codification of\r\nthe article which is substantively the same.\r\n</p><p>10.   <span>We express no opinion as to whether the admittance of this evidence was\r\nproper; however, as no objections were lodged, the testimony and affidavits of the jurors\r\nare available for our consideration in determining whether reversible error occurred.  <em>See\r\nSalazar v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103770/salazar-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 147 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); <em>see also McQuarrie v.\r\nState</em>, No. PD-0803-11,</span><span> slip op. at 9-18, ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 10, 2012).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.   Appellant contends that several jurors testified at the motion for new trial hearing that\r\nthey thought that they were \"coerced\" into believing that the verdict had to be \"unanimous\" or\r\nthey \"all had to agree\" either 12-0 or 10-2, <em>because</em> the trial court instructed them to continue\r\ndeliberating.  However, we have reviewed the record and we do not find that any juror, including\r\nJenkins, testified as such.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
