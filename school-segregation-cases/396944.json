Bass appeals the district court’s order granting summary\n\njudgment to the Board of County Commissioners of Orange County in his lawsuit\n\nclaiming race discrimination in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause, as well as retaliation in violation of Title VII. For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we reverse and remand for a jury trial on his race discrimination and\n\nretaliation claims.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A. Facts\n\n      In August 1995, the Orange County Fire and Rescue Division (the\n\n“Division” or “Fire and Rescue Division”) began a reorganization of its workforce\n\nas a result of a $9 million budget shortfall. A number of positions were eliminated,\n\nincluding all four Training Captain positions, one of which was held by Michael\n\nBass, the white male plaintiff in this case. Like the other three people employed in\n\nthat position, Bass received a layoff notice in September 1995.\n\n      The four Captain-level positions that were eliminated were replaced with\n\nthree Lieutenant-level Training Instructor positions. Bass applied for one of those\n\nthree positions. In order to become a Training Instructor, the County specified that\n\na person must have “two years training instructor or closely related work\n\n\n                                           2\n\fexperience” and “must possess and maintain a valid Florida Department of\n\nEducation Teacher’s Certificate or obtain [one] within 18 months of employment.”\n\nBass’ qualifications exceeded those minimums. Moreover, according to Frank\n\nMontes de Oca, who was Chief in Charge of Training at the Division, as a training\n\ninstructor Bass “was an excellent employee who constantly received good or\n\noutstanding evaluations.” He was first or second in seniority among instructors,\n\nand, under terms of the union contract, should have been the last or next to last to\n\nbe laid off in the event of a reduction in force.\n\n      All qualified persons, including those who had been laid off, were allowed\n\nto apply for the three Training Instructor positions. The Fire and Rescue Division\n\nused a Performance Based Interview system to select candidates for various\n\npositions, including the Training Instructor positions. In that type of interview,\n\ncandidates are asked pre-selected questions to test their responses to hypothetical\n\nsituations they may face on the job. The candidates are expected to respond by\n\nexplaining what they have done in similar situations.\n\n      A three-member panel interviewed Bass and twelve other applicants for the\n\nthree Training Instructor positions. The members of the interview panel were\n\nCharles Middleton (black male), Ray Valle (Hispanic male), and Betty Meeks\n\n(black female). At the time of the reorganization, Middleton was the Acting\n\n\n                                           3\n\fAssistant Department Manager in charge of Administration and had supervisory\n\nresponsibility over the Division’s Training Instructors. He was also a member of\n\nthe Progressive Firefighters Association, an advocacy organization for black\n\nfirefighters, and he was known to support affirmative action and a promotional\n\n“fast track” for minorities.\n\n       Middleton testified that he selected Meeks and Valle for the interview panel\n\nand that, in doing so, he “[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement\n\nwith the training function” so that they would have had nothing at stake in the\n\nDivision’s reorganization. Meeks was employed in the County’s Human\n\nResources Department, and admits that she had no knowledge beyond that of a lay\n\nperson concerning the position of fire department training instructor. She was also\n\nknown to be a supporter of affirmative action. Although Valle was employed by\n\nthe Division, he worked as an information technology specialist and had no\n\ntraining in firefighting. Nothing in the record indicates Valle’s views on\n\naffirmative action. Therefore, with the possible exception of Middleton,1 none of\n\n\n\n       1\n        The record is less clear with respect to Middleton’s experience and credentials. The\nrecord seems to indicate that Middleton was not a certified firefighter in the State of Florida.\nFurthermore, although the record shows that Middleton had supervisory responsibility over the\nDivision’s Training Instructors, nothing in the record indicates that Middleton had any personal\nexperience as a Training Instructor. Given the procedural posture, of course, we are required to\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Bass. Viewing the evidence that\nway, Middleton was not a certified firefighter and had no experience as a Training Instructor.\n\n                                                4\n\fthe panel members was a certified firefighter in Florida, nor had any panel member\n\nheld a Training Instructor position.\n\n      Not only did the panel members lack experience as Training Instructors,\n\nnone of them was given any training or guidelines (other than general training\n\nconcerning interview skills) to help them evaluate which candidates were best\n\nqualified for the positions. Remarkably, none of them received any job description\n\nshowing the duties of a Training Instructor. Nor did any of them receive the\n\ninterview questions until just before the start of the interviews. They were not told\n\nto take notes of the interviews, and none of them did.\n\n      Mitch Floyd, who was Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1989\n\nuntil April 1995, stated in his affidavit that the County had adopted the interview\n\nprocess “to create some leeway to allow us to promote minority candidates.” He\n\nstated under oath that the interview score was not supposed to be determinative,\n\nbut was meant to be only one of several factors, including education, experience,\n\nand diversity (i.e., race and gender) that were to be considered. The County’s\n\nwritten policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that the\n\ninterview was only one component to be considered. Similarly, Tom Preston (not\n\nrelated to one of the candidates, Henry Preston), who developed the interview\n\nprocess for the Training Instructor position, stated that the interview scores were\n\n\n                                           5\n\fnot intended to be determinative. The interviews for the Training Instructor\n\npositions took place in October 1995. After the panel finished interviewing all the\n\ncandidates, the panel members combined their individual scores for each candidate\n\nand then ranked the candidates based on their aggregate interview scores. The\n\npanel ranked Bass ninth out of the thirteen applicants. Middleton and Valle\n\ntestified that Bass did not answer the questions that were asked and did not\n\ninterview as well as expected considering his experience as a training officer.\n\n(Meeks was not questioned about Bass interview performance during her\n\ndeposition.) Contrary to the written policy and all the testimony about how the\n\ninterview results were to be used, selections for the Training Instructor position\n\nwere made solely on the basis of the interview scores.2 Because Bass received a\n\n       2\n           The interview scores were as follows:\n\nName                   Previously Supervisor           Score   Selected   Race\nGina McCollum                 Yes            16          X           W\nDan Kucik                     No             15                      W\nDonna Reed                    Yes            13          X           W\nHenry Preston                 No             13          X           B\nDavid Cohen                   No             12                      W\nKaren Barber                  No             12                      W\nHenry Butts                   No             11                      W\nJohn Russell                  Yes            10                      B\nMichael Bass                  Yes             8                      W\nVictoria Quick                No              7                      W\nStephen Manning               No              5                      W\nThomas Wheeler                No              4                      W\nTerry Boston                  No              4                      W\n\nThe candidate with the second-highest score, Dan Kucik, was selected for (and accepted) the\n\n                                                   6\n\flow score on the interview, the panel did not choose him for one of the three\n\nTraining Instructor positions. Instead, the panel chose three of the applicants\n\nwhom it had given higher interview scores: a black male and two white females.\n\n       Henry Preston, the black candidate selected for one of the three Training\n\nInstructor positions, did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the position.\n\nHis resume reflected that he had no experience as a Training Instructor and only\n\ntwo years of experience as a firefighter, even though one of the minimum\n\nrequirements for a Training Instructor position was “two (2) years training\n\ninstructor or closely related work experience.” Moreover, Preston misrepresented\n\nhis qualifications both on his general employment application and on his Training\n\nInstructor application. Although Preston represented on those documents that he\n\nattended the University of Central Florida for three years as an accounting major\n\nand earned 94 credits there, he had never attended that university. Preston testified\n\nin his deposition that the County’s Human Resources Department knew he had\n\n“exaggerated” his educational credits. Initially he had submitted an application\n\nwhich truthfully showed he lacked the necessary qualifications, but someone from\n\n\nhigher-ranking position of Group Supervisor. The Group Supervisors were chosen through a\nseparate selection process which involved different PBI interviews. Therefore, Kucik’s\nperformance during his Training Instructor interview does not account for his selection as a\nGroup Supervisor. John Russell (black male), who ranked eighth in the Training Instructor\ninterview was also selected as a Group Supervisor. Bass applied for a Group Supervisor\nposition, but was not selected.\n\n                                               7\n\fHuman Resources told him that his application needed to be changed before it\n\nwould be accepted. Taking the suggestion, Preston submitted a second application,\n\nand this one falsely stated he had attended the University of Central Florida. It was\n\nonly on the basis of that lie about his qualifications, a lie he testified the County\n\nhad encouraged, that Henry Preston was judged to be qualified for a Training\n\nInstructor position.\n\n      After being denied a Training Instructor position for which he was\n\nindisputably qualified, Bass was given the choice of being demoted to\n\nengineer/paramedic or being laid-off. He took the demotion. In October 1995,\n\nBass filed a union grievance challenging his demotion and removal from training\n\nduties. On November 17, 1995, while his grievance was pending, Bass complained\n\nto the Division Chief James Moody that Henry Preston lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position. Bass recorded the events in his\n\ndiary writing as follows:\n\n      Met with Moody. . . . Advised him that Preston, Reed and Kucik did\n      not have an A.S. degree, only high school degree and Reed had a\n      GED and Preston did not qualify for training position. Witnessed by\n      Wertz and Angel Gonzales. Moody advised me that the County will\n      continue to promote based on color and that I should file legal action\n      against the County.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f        In December 1995, the County settled Bass’ union grievance without a\n\nhearing by reassigning him to be a fourth Training Instructor. Bass was given the\n\njob title, rank, and pay of a Training Instructor, but he was not assigned to a district\n\nand was not permitted to perform the duties of a Training Instructor. Before the\n\nreorganization, there were four Training Instructors, each holding the rank of\n\nCaptain, assigned to cover five battalions. After the reorganization, there were\n\nthree Training Instructors, each holding the rank of Lieutenant, assigned to cover\n\nthree districts (as the battalions were renamed). One Training Instructor was\n\nassigned to each of the three districts. As a result, when the Division finally made\n\nBass a Training Instructor he was the fourth one, and there was no vacant district\n\nto assign him.\n\n      In December 1995, on his first day as a Training Instructor, Bass was\n\nassigned to clean out a warehouse – work ordinarily done by inmates supplied by\n\nthe Department of Corrections. Between December 1995 and April 1996, Bass had\n\nno routine work assignments, performed custodial and clerical duties, and usually\n\nwas supervised by personnel who were less senior than he. Middleton, who was\n\nin charge of the Training Instructors, and Chief Smith ordered Bass not to record\n\non his work logs the custodial and clerical work he was performing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      Bass’ non-custodial assignments included working with the Division’s\n\nEmergency Medical Services unit, working on the Community Health Care\n\nInitiative, teaching CPR for Head-start day care workers, and assisting other\n\nTraining Instructors in developing training programs. Bass was not permitted to\n\nearn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of-classification pay, or adjunct teaching\n\npay, all of which were available to the other Training Instructors. Although he\n\npreviously had been permitted to teach numerous outside courses, such as a SWAT\n\nteam tactical rope course offered at various law enforcement agencies, in his\n\nposition as Training Instructor Bass was denied all opportunities to teach outside\n\ncourses. He also was required to take tests in order to retain his paramedic pay,\n\nwhile the three other training instructors were not.\n\n      In January 1997, Bass was transferred out of the Training Bureau without\n\neven being told of the transfer. He learned of the transfer upon returning from\n\nvacation and discovering that his paycheck was no longer available in the Training\n\nBureau and that he was no longer on that bureau’s payroll. From January until\n\nApril of 1997, Bass did not know where he had been transferred or to whom he\n\nwas to report. In April 1997, he was told to report for work in a non-budgeted\n\nposition that was not covered by the union contract. After the union complained,\n\nBass was allowed to keep his Training Instructor title, and he was given a\n\n\n                                          10\n\ftemporary assignment under Chief Weagraff in Quality Assurance. In the spring\n\nof 1998, one of the three budgeted Training Instructor positions became available,\n\nbut it was not given to Bass. In fact, it was never filled. At least as late as\n\nFebruary 1999, Bass was still temporarily assigned to Chief Weagraff.\n\n                                    B. Procedural History\n\n       Bass filed a ten-count complaint against the County on March 31, 1997. The\n\ncomplaint contained race discrimination claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11. The\n\ncomplaint also contained retaliation claims under Title VII; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; the\n\nFlorida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11; and the First\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution; and a claim under Florida’s\n\nveterans’ preference statutes, Fla. Stat. §§ 295.07 & 295.085.3\n\n       The County moved for summary judgment. With respect to the race\n\ndiscrimination claims, the County proffered as its reason for not giving Bass one of\n\n\n\n       3\n          On appeal, Bass does not challenge the district court’s rulings on his Title VI or\nveterans’ preference claims, but argues that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment on his race discrimination and retaliation claims.\n\n                                                11\n\fthe Training Instructor positions his poor performance on the Performance Based\n\nInterview. With respect to Bass’ retaliation claims, the County argued that Bass\n\ncould not establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and that even if he could, he\n\ncould not refute the County’s asserted legitimate reason for its actions – he was not\n\ngiven Training Instructor duties because there was not an open district. The district\n\ncourt entered an order granting summary judgment to the County as to all counts in\n\nthe complaint.\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, using the\n\nsame legal standard employed by the district court. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. City of\n\nAtlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1117 (11th Cir. 1993). \"Summary judgment is appropriate if\n\nthe record shows no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. When deciding whether summary judgment\n\nis appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are\n\nreviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" Witter v. Delta Air\n\nLines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998) (citation and quotations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n                      A. RACE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n      In his complaint, Bass alleges that the County discriminated against him\n\nbased on his race (non-Hispanic, white) in violation of Title VII, § 1981, § 1983,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act. Sometimes this type of claim, where a white employee alleges to be\n\nthe victim of discrimination, is referred to as a “reverse discrimination” claim.\n\nWhatever the rhetorical effect of that phrase in the ongoing public debate over\n\naffirmative action may be, it has no place in the legal analysis of the alleged\n\ngovernmental action before us. Discrimination is discrimination no matter what\n\nthe race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the victim. See McDonald v.\n\nSante Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 2579 (1976)\n\n(holding that Title VII prohibits discrimination against whites as well as non-\n\nwhites). Our Constitution does not distinguish between races and neither do we.\n\nSee Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 1146 (1896) (Harlan,\n\nJ., dissenting) (“Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates\n\nclasses among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the\n\nlaw.”). As Justice Scalia has observed, “In the eyes of government, we are just\n\none race here. It is American.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n\n\n                                          13\n\f239, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2119 (1995) (concurring opinion); see also Regents of Univ.\n\nof Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289-90, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2748 (1978) (Powell, J.,\n\nplurality opinion) (“The guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when\n\napplied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another\n\ncolor.”). Racial discrimination against whites is just as repugnant to\n\nconstitutionally protected values of equality as racial discrimination against blacks.\n\nTherefore, we will treat Bass’ Title VII and Equal Protection Clause\n\ndiscrimination claims as discrimination claims, not as “reverse discrimination”\n\nclaims, and we will analyze his claims exactly as we would any racial\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n      Although the analyses for Bass’ Title VII and Equal Protection claims are\n\nclosely related, the Supreme Court has recognized that it “do[es] not regard as\n\nidentical the constraints of Title VII and the Federal Constitution.” Johnson v.\n\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, Calif., 480 U.S. 616, 632, 107 S. Ct.\n\n1442, 1452 (1987). In addressing the interplay between Title VII and § 1983, we\n\nrecently concluded that Congress intended to make available separate, non-\n\nexclusive causes of actions and remedies under these provisions, and held that a\n\nplaintiff may bring a claim under one provision without asserting a claim under the\n\nother. Thigpen v. Bibb County, Sheriff’s Dep’t, 223 F.3d 1231, 1237-39 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f2000). Because claims under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause are\n\ndistinct and the Supreme Court has instructed us that different standards are\n\napplicable to them, we will address these claims separately.\n\n                              1. Title VII Framework\n\n      Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer \"to fail\n\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against\n\nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Bass alleges that the County violated Title VII by\n\nrefusing to hire him for the Training Instructor position because he is a non-\n\nHispanic, white person.\n\n      A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim through the introduction of direct\n\nevidence of discrimination or through circumstantial evidence that creates an\n\ninference of discrimination. To evaluate Title VII claims based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, we use the familiar framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), and Texas Department of\n\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981). See Combs\n\nv. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1527-28 (11th Cir. 1997). Under this\n\nframework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\n\n                                          15\n\fSee Combs, 106 F.3d at 1527-28 (citations omitted). In order to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of race discrimination under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that: (1)\n\nhe was qualified and applied for the position; (2) he was rejected despite his\n\nqualifications; and (3) other equally or less qualified employees who are not\n\nmembers of his race were hired. See Taylor v. Runyan, 175 F.3d 861, 866 (11th\n\nCir. 1999) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 847 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir.1988)). Once the\n\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer must\n\narticulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.\n\nSee Wu, 847 F.2d at 1483-84. If the employer meets this burden of production, the\n\nplaintiff then must establish that each of the defendant's proffered reasons for\n\nhiring someone of a different race is pretextual. See id.\n\n      “[I]n cases of discrimination proven by direct evidence, it is incorrect to rely\n\non the McDonnell Douglas test because, while circumstantial evidence is used to\n\ncreate an inference of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, no such inference\n\nis required in the case of direct evidence.” Taylor, 175 F.3d at 867 n.2; Evans v.\n\nMcLain of Georgia, Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 962 (11th Cir. 1997) (“[O]nce a plaintiff\n\nproduces direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, and the trier of facts accepts\n\nthis testimony the ultimate issue of discrimination is proved.” (citation and internal\n\nquotation omitted)); Trotter v. Board of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala., 91 F.3d\n\n\n                                          16\n\f1449, 1453 (11th Cir.1996) (\"When there is direct evidence that discrimination was\n\na motivating factor in the challenged employment decision, the appropriate\n\nanalysis is different from that employed in a case where only circumstantial\n\nevidence is available.\"). The defendant’s burden when refuting direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination is one of persuasion and not merely production. See Hill v.\n\nMetropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 841 F.2d 1533, 1539 (11th Cir. 1988).\n\nBass attempts to prove his Title VII claim with both direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence of discrimination.\n\n      In this case, the County has not disputed that Bass established a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Therefore, for\n\npurposes of summary judgment, we assume that Bass is in a protected class, was\n\nqualified to become a Training Instructor, applied for the position, was rejected\n\ndespite his qualifications and was rejected in favor of another less qualified\n\nemployee of a different race. The dispute in this case concerns whether Bass has\n\nalso presented direct evidence of discrimination, and, if not, whether he has put\n\nforth sufficient circumstantial evidence that the County’s proffered non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for its actions (i.e., Bass’ poor performance during his\n\ninterview) was pretextual. We now turn to these disputed issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f   2. Title VII Direct Evidence Contention Based on Chief Moody’s Statements\n\n      First, Bass contends that a statement made to him by Chief Moody – the\n\nchief of the Fire and Rescue Division at the time of the decision not to offer Bass\n\none of the Training Instructor positions during the 1995 reorganization –\n\nconstitutes direct evidence of discrimination. Bass testified that he confronted\n\nChief Moody about the promotion of employees who lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position, and Moody responded that the\n\nCounty would continue to promote based on color. We agree with the district\n\ncourt that this statement does not rise to the level of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination by the Division.\n\n      Direct evidence of discrimination is “evidence which, if believed, would\n\nprove the existence of a fact [in issue] without inference or presumption.” Earley\n\nv. Champion Int’l Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation and\n\nemphasis omitted). “[O]nly the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be\n\nnothing other than to discriminate on the basis of [race] . . . constitute direct\n\nevidence of discrimination.” Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196\n\nF.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). “For statements of\n\ndiscriminatory intent to constitute direct evidence of discrimination, they must be\n\nmade by a person involved in the challenged decision.” Trotter v. Bd. of Trustees,\n\n\n                                           18\n\f91 F.3d 1449, 1453-54 (11th Cir. 1996). “[R]emarks by non-decisionmakers or\n\nremarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination.” Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n      Bass argues that Chief Moody’s statement – made close in time to the\n\ndecision to offer the Training Instructor positions to other candidates and against\n\nthe backdrop of the County’s affirmative action plans – constitutes direct evidence\n\nof discrimination. However, Bass presented no evidence showing that Moody was\n\na decisionmaker or involved in the selection of the Training Instructors. Although\n\nBass attaches significance to the fact that Moody was the chief at the time of the\n\ndecision, the fact remains that Moody was not a member of the interview panel and\n\nwas not involved in the selection process. Only statements by the persons involved\n\nin the decisionmaking process, here the interview panel members, could constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. Therefore, although Moody’s statements may\n\nprovide significant circumstantial support for Bass’ claims, they do not constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1330.\n\n            3. Circumstantial Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      Even though Chief Moody’s statements are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, we believe that Bass has put forth ample circumstantial evidence of\n\n\n                                         19\n\fdiscrimination to permit his Title VII, § 1981 and Florida Civil Rights Act claims\n\nto go to a jury. In addition, for the reasons explained in section 4, infra, we find\n\nthat the County’s affirmative action plans, when viewed in light of the\n\ncircumstantial evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the\n\nDivision was acting pursuant to those plans, do constitute direct evidence of racial\n\ndiscrimination against Bass. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment against Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claims.\n\n      It is undisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of race\n\ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Consequently, a\n\npresumption of discrimination arose and the burden shifted to the County to proffer\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass. See Combs, 106 F. 3d\n\nat 1527-28. To meet that burden of production, the County proffered one reason, a\n\nsubjective one, for not hiring Bass for a Training Instructor position. The County\n\nclaimed that Bass did not score as well on his interview (purportedly the only\n\nselection criterion used) as the other candidates selected for the position.\n\n      This Court recently reaffirmed that a subjective reason for an employer’s\n\naction – such as poor interview performance – can be as legitimate as any other\n\nreason. See Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F. 3d 1012, 1033 (11th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc). An interview is frequently necessary to assess qualities that are particularly\n\n\n                                          20\n\fimportant in supervisory or professional positions. Id. at 1033. This is because\n\n“[t]raits such as common sense, good judgment, originality, ambition, loyalty, and\n\ntact often must be assessed primarily in a subjective fashion.” Id. at 1034 (internal\n\nmarks and citations omitted). However, in order for a subjective reason to\n\nconstitute a legally sufficient, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the defendant\n\nmust articulate “a clear and reasonably specific factual basis upon which it based\n\nits subjective opinion.” Id.; see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258, 101 S. Ct. at 1096\n\n(“[T]he defendant’s explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and\n\nreasonably specific” so that “the plaintiff be afforded a ‘full and fair opportunity’\n\nto demonstrate pretext.”).\n\n      Although the proffered reason, Bass’ poor interview, was subjective, the\n\nCounty offered explanations of why the interview panel, the decisionmakers,\n\narrived at that subjective conclusion. Valle stated that Bass “did not interview\n\nanywhere near as well as [he] expected him to” and observed that Bass “didn’t\n\nanswer the questions that [the interviewers] were asking.” Middleton opined that\n\nBass “could have presented himself better” and that Bass gave “answers\n\nirrespective of the questions.” Bass’ testimony does not contradict the panel\n\nmembers’ assessment of his interview performance. Bass stated that he “had the\n\nimpression that [the interview] was just some kind of a go-through-the-motion\n\n\n                                          21\n\fthing.” Although Bass admitted that he did not perform well during the interview,\n\nhe claimed that his poor performance was caused by Middleton’s interrupting him\n\nwhile he was trying to answer the questions. Middleton did not recall interrupting\n\nBass during the interview, but Valle testified that if a candidate was “headed in the\n\nwrong direction” the interviewers would “try and help” the candidate by\n\n“clarify[ing] what it was [they] were looking for.”\n\n      Because the interviewers explained the grounds for their subjective\n\nevaluation with reasonable clarity and specificity, the County met its burden of\n\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass as a Training\n\nInstructor. After the County articulated this reason, the burden shifted back to\n\nBass to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact that the\n\nCounty’s non-discriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination. In response,\n\nBass argued that: (1) the County encouraged employees to hire and promote based\n\non race and established a system for hiring and promotion which created leeway so\n\nthat minorities could advance more easily; (2) Chief Moody said that the County\n\nwas going to continue to promote on the basis of color; (3) Preston, the black\n\ncandidate selected as a Training Instructor, did not meet the minimal qualifications\n\nfor the position; (4) the Fire and Rescue Division deviated from its established\n\nprocedures and the interview process was otherwise tainted; and last, but not least,\n\n\n                                          22\n\f(5) the County had in place affirmative action plans with the goal of increasing\n\nminority representation within the Division.\n\n                   a. Pressure to Hire and Promote Minorities\n\n      With respect to Bass’ first pretext argument, he introduced evidence of\n\ncounty officials’ emphasis on hiring and promoting based upon race. Montes de\n\nOca, Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1990 though 1997, testified that\n\nhe was pressured to hire more minorities and that he had received periodic reports\n\nshowing the number of women and blacks in all positions. Mitch Floyd, Chief of\n\nthe Division from 1989 until April 1, 1995, testified that managers’ success or\n\nfailure in meeting the County’s affirmative action goals “could adversely affect\n\ntheir future as managers,” and that the County Administrator, County Chairwoman,\n\nand the County Commission regularly communicated this to the Division\n\nmanagers. From that evidence a jury could reasonably find the County had a\n\npolicy of racial discrimination against non-Hispanic whites.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that the interview system, the same system that\n\nwas used in hiring the Training Instructors, was used to carry out the affirmative\n\naction plans’ goals of emphasizing race in hiring decisions, i.e., the policy of racial\n\ndiscrimination against non-Hispanic whites. Floyd, who developed the interview\n\nsystem for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor positions and who was a\n\n\n                                          23\n\fmember of the Group Supervisor interview panel, testified that Performance Based\n\ninterviews were adopted as a subjective evaluation process that would create\n\n“leeway” in promoting minorities because the County “didn’t have the time or\n\nvacancies to wait out the gradual improvement of skills.”\n\n      This evidence of pressure in the County to hire minorities over non-\n\nminorities, combined with the existence of an interview system adopted in order to\n\ncreate leeway to promote minorities, constitutes circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent behind the Division’s hiring decisions.\n\n       b. Chief Moody’s Statement Concerning Race-Based Promotion\n\n      As to his second pretext argument, Bass testified that when he confronted\n\nChief Moody about Henry Preston’s lacking the requisite qualifications, Moody\n\ntold him that the County would continue to promote on the basis of color. As we\n\nhave already said, because Bass did not introduce sufficient evidence establishing\n\nthat Moody was a decisionmaker, his statement cannot constitute direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Nonetheless, this statement does constitute circumstantial evidence\n\nof discrimination because it raises the inference that the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel members improperly based their decisions on race, rather than\n\nperformance during the interview or other legitimate criteria.\n\n                    c. Promotion of Less-Qualified Candidate\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      In support of his third pretext argument, Bass presented evidence that he was\n\nthe most qualified applicant for the position and that Preston did not even meet the\n\nminimum qualifications for the position. At the time he applied for the Training\n\nInstructor position, Preston’s resume reflected that he had no experience as a\n\nTraining Instructor and only two years of experience with the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision and had earned no credits toward his teaching certificate. It should have\n\nbeen obvious on the face of Preston’s application that he could not meet the\n\nmandatory criterion of obtaining a Florida teaching certification within 18 months\n\nof being promoted and that he lacked the requisite two years of Training Instructor\n\nexperience.\n\n      Hiring a less qualified person can support an inference of discriminatory\n\nmotivation. See Alexander v. Fulton County, 207 F.3d 1303, 1340 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (“both the Supreme Court and this court have observed that evidence\n\nshowing an employer hired a less qualified applicant over the plaintiff may be\n\nprobative of whether the employer's proffered reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nwas pretextual”); Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1190 (11th Cir. 1998) (“The\n\nfact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the\n\napplicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be\n\nprobative of whether the employer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination.”\n\n\n                                          25\n\f(internal marks, emphasis and citation omitted)). Here, the fact that the Division\n\npromoted Preston, an employee who was unqualified under the Division’s criteria,\n\nover Bass supports an inference of discrimination. This inference is further\n\nstrengthened by Chief Moody’s statement that the County would continue to\n\npromote based on race and by other circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                     d. Deviation from Standard Procedure\n\n      In support of his fourth pretext argument, Bass presented evidence indicating\n\nthat the Fire and Rescue Division departed from its standard procedure when it\n\ninterviewed the applicants for the Training Instructor positions. Tom Preston, who\n\ndeveloped the interview process for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor\n\npositions, testified that interview scores were not intended to be determinative, and\n\nthe interview policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that\n\nthe interview was only one component to be considered. The policy, which was\n\nidentified in deposition by Valle, included the following instructions:\n\n      NOTE: Do not total scores. This process is intended to develop a\n      profile, highlighting a candidate’s areas of strength and weakness.\n      This process was designed as one component to be used in\n      conjunction with other criteria to determine a final selection.\n\nThe Division violated these written procedures by totaling the scores and relying\n\nexclusively upon the interviews. An employer’s violation of its own normal hiring\n\nprocedure may be evidence of pretext. See Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 885\n\n                                          26\n\fF.2d 804, 811 (11th Cir. 1989). We believe that this is especially true where, as\n\nhere, an employer disregards all but one of the factors and qualifications generally\n\ntaken into consideration and relies solely on a factor which was designed to create\n\n“leeway” for the promotion of people of a certain race.\n\n      Furthermore, other facts surrounding the interview process used in selecting\n\nthe Training Instructors indicate that the process was suspect. For example, the\n\ninterviewers, who were the sole decisionmakers, received no training or guidelines\n\nto help them evaluate which candidates were best qualified for the Training\n\nInstructor positions. The interviewers were supposed to evaluate the applicants’\n\nresponses to certain situations to determine which candidates would make the best\n\nTraining Instructors, yet the interviewers were never even informed of what duties\n\na Training Instructor had. Although Middleton testified that he had at some time\n\nreceived training in the interview process itself, he said he received no training\n\nwith respect to the specific qualifications to look for when interviewing the\n\nTraining Instructor applicants. Valle, another member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that he knew very little about firefighter training at the\n\ntime he served on the panel. Meeks, the final member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that she had no knowledge of firefighting or training\n\nwhen she served on the panel. Furthermore, despite the fact that the panel\n\n\n                                           27\n\fmembers were called upon to judge the applicants’ qualifications to be Training\n\nInstructors, Middleton, who chose the other two panel members, testified that he\n\n“[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement with the training\n\nfunction.”\n\n      We recognize that “a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or\n\nbad reason without violating federal law” and “[w]e are not in the business of\n\nadjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.” Damon v. Fleming\n\nSupermarkets of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999). We are,\n\nhowever, in the business of adjudging whether an employer violated Title VII by\n\nimproperly making employment decisions on account of race. In this case, the\n\nselection process employed by the Division, when viewed in light of the other\n\nevidence of the County’s race-conscious hiring and promotion efforts, constituted\n\ncircumstantial evidence that the Division was acting with race in mind while\n\nselecting Training Instructors.\n\n                    e. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      The last category of evidence that the proffered interview reason was pretext\n\nis the County’s affirmative action plans, which were in effect at the time that the\n\nFire and Rescue Division refused Bass a Training Instructor position. As we will\n\nexplain in the next section, we think the County’s affirmative action plans are\n\n\n                                          28\n\factually direct evidence of discrimination. But if they were not direct evidence,\n\nthey would certainly be strong circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                                        f. Conclusion\n\n       We conclude that the evidence offered by Bass was more than sufficient to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact about whether the County’s articulated\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for not hiring him was pretextual. The county officials’\n\nemphasis on promoting employees based upon race, the statement by Chief Moody\n\nconcerning race-conscious efforts, the Division’s deviation from procedures, the\n\nhiring of an unqualified candidate instead of Bass, and the existence of formal\n\naffirmative action plans provide more than enough evidence for a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that the County’s proffered non-discriminatory explanation for its\n\nactions was pretextual. The district court erred when it granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of the County on Bass’ race discrimination claims under Title VII, § 1981\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act.4\n\n                   4. Direct Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n       4\n        Although Bass has presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, we have recognized that “decisions construing Title VII are applicable\nwhen considering claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act. . . . ” Harper v. Blockbuster\nEntertainment Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998). Likewise, “[t]he elements of a\nclaim of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate\ntreatment claim in the employment context.” Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d\n836, 843 n.11 (11th Cir. 2000). Therefore, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgement as to Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claim, we also reverse as to his\nrace discrimination claims brought under the Florida Civil Rights Act and § 1981.\n\n                                               29\n\f      We now turn to the consideration of the County’s affirmative action plans as\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination supporting Bass’ Title VII, § 1981 and Florida\n\nCivil Rights Act claims. The affirmative action issues in this case arise in a\n\nsomewhat unusual posture. In a typical Title VII case involving an affirmative\n\naction plan, an employer asserts in response to a plaintiff’s prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination that its employment decision was made pursuant to an affirmative\n\naction plan and that its compliance with such a plan was a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See, e.g., Johnson v. Transportation\n\nAgency, Santa Clara County, Calif., 480 U.S. 616, 626-27, 107 S. Ct. 1442, 1449\n\n(1987). The question in those circumstances is whether the employer’s affirmative\n\naction plan is valid.\n\n      In this case, the County seeks no cover from its affirmative action plans\n\n(and, in fact, seems to distance itself from them), and it is Bass who relies on the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans in support of his claims. Of course, a defendant\n\nwho in fact acts pursuant to an affirmative action plan cannot avoid judicial review\n\nof the plan by disavowing reliance upon it, where there is evidence that the plan\n\nplayed a part in the employment decision.\n\n      The first step in ascertaining whether the County can be held liable for\n\ndiscrimination as a result of its affirmative action plans is a determination of\n\n\n                                          30\n\fwhether there is sufficient evidence that it acted pursuant to those plans. The mere\n\nexistence of an affirmative action plan by itself does not constitute direct evidence\n\nof discrimination unless there is also evidence that the employer acted pursuant to\n\nthe plan in making employment decisions. See Brown v. McLean, 159 F.3d 898,\n\n904 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that affirmative action plan is only relevant if\n\ndefendant acted pursuant to plan); Cerrato v. San Francisco Community College\n\nDist., 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir. 1994) (same); McQuillen v. Wisconsin Educ.\n\nAss’n Council, 830 F.2d 659, 666 (7th Cir. 1987) (same).\n\n      However, the existence of an affirmative action plan, when combined with\n\nevidence that the plan was followed in an employment decision, is sufficient to\n\nconstitute direct evidence of discrimination. See McGarry v. Board of County\n\nComm’rs of Pitkin, 175 F.3d 1193, 1200 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that county\n\npersonnel director’s statements that those hired were not better qualified than white\n\napplicant and that those hirings were minority affirmative action hirings, made\n\nagainst the backdrop of the county’s policy statements regarding hiring and\n\naffirmative action, constituted direct evidence of discrimination). Furthermore,\n\neven when a defendant denies having acted pursuant to its affirmative action plan,\n\nif there is evidence that it may have done so, a jury must decide whether the\n\ndefendant in fact acted pursuant to its stated plan. See Messer v. Meno, 130 F.3d\n\n\n                                          31\n\f130, 139 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding that jury could conclude that defendant acted\n\npursuant to affirmative action plan in light of circumstantial evidence even though\n\ndefendant denied having taken plan into account). When a jury finds that a\n\ngovernment employer acted pursuant to an affirmative action plan, then the\n\nemployer should be held liable for discrimination unless the plan satisfies the\n\ndemanding scrutiny required by Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause. This is\n\nbecause, regardless of good intentions, a government employer commits unlawful\n\ndiscrimination when it takes race into account in an employment decision and acts\n\npursuant to an invalid affirmative action plan.5\n\n      a. Meaning of “Direct Evidence” in Context of Discrimination Claim\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we hold that where there is an affirmative action\n\nplan in effect that relates to the employer’s actions which are the subject of a\n\ndiscrimination claim, the affirmative action plan constitutes direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to permit a jury\n\n\n       5\n         In another case recently before this Court, a plaintiff in a race discrimination lawsuit\nsought summary judgment as to the employer’s liability based on its undisputed compliance with\nits affirmative action plan. See Thigpen v. Bibb County, Sheriff’s Dep’t, 223 F.3d 1231, 1244\n(11th Cir. 2000). Although we did not rule out that such a finding of liability might be\nappropriate in some cases, we noted that an affirmative action plan “does not necessarily offend\nthe equal protection clause,” and remanded that case for a determination of whether the\naffirmative action plan passed muster under strict scrutiny analysis. Id. Our analysis in Thigpen\nleaves open the possibility, however, that summary judgment as to liability for discrimination\nmight be appropriate where there is no dispute over whether a defendant was acting pursuant to\nan affirmative action plan, if a district court determines that the affirmative action plan is invalid\nunder Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                                 32\n\freasonably to conclude that the employer was acting pursuant to its plan in taking\n\nthe employment action in question.\n\n      Because we believe that the phrase has been a source of confusion, we begin\n\nby discussing the meaning of “direct evidence” in the context of a Title VII race\n\ndiscrimination claim. First, we note that the phrase “direct evidence,” when used\n\nin the context of discrimination claims, does not refer to whether evidence is direct\n\nor circumstantial in the ordinary evidentiary sense in which we normally think of\n\nthose terms. Instead, “direct evidence” refers to a type of evidence which, if true,\n\nwould require no inferential leap in order for a court to find discrimination. We do\n\nnot believe that the status of evidence as “direct” in this context, however, changes\n\nsimply because a defendant contests the validity of the evidence, thereby requiring\n\nthe plaintiff to offer proof related to the disputed evidence through other means.\n\nTherefore, an affirmative action plan may constitute direct evidence, even when a\n\ndefendant denies having acted pursuant to its stated plan.\n\n      This view of direct evidence is supported by this Court’s case law\n\naddressing other types of direct evidence of discrimination. We have held that\n\n“[w]here the non-movant presents direct evidence that, if believed by the jury,\n\nwould be sufficient to win at trial, summary judgment is not appropriate even\n\nwhere the movant presents conflicting evidence.” Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of\n\n\n                                         33\n\fEduc., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996) (emphasis added). Furthermore, “[w]e\n\nhave defined direct evidence as ‘evidence, which if believed, proves the existence\n\nof fact in issue without inference or presumption.’” Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co.,\n\n120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc., 833\n\nF.2d 1525, 1528 n.6 (11th Cir. 1987)) (emphasis added). Therefore, “direct\n\nevidence” of discrimination may be disputed, and it may well be that a plaintiff\n\nwill have to establish the “direct evidence” by introducing circumstantial evidence.\n\nFor example, in Merritt, we considered whether an alleged statement by an\n\nemployer constituted direct evidence in support of the plaintiff’s retaliation claim.\n\nMerritt, 120 F.3d at 1189-91. In that case, the employer denied that a\n\ndecisionmaker had made a statement which, if true, clearly showed a retaliatory\n\nmotive behind the termination of the plaintiff’s employment. Id. Nonetheless, we\n\nconcluded that because the plaintiff could prove – whether by circumstantial\n\nevidence or any other means – that the decisionmaker did make the statement,\n\nthere was direct evidence of retaliation precluding summary judgment. Id. Given\n\nthis approach, we hold, for the following reasons, that Bass has put forth direct\n\nevidence of discrimination in the form of the County’s affirmative action plans\n\neven though there is conflicting evidence concerning whether the Division acted\n\npursuant to those plans.\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f                   b. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      We begin with the facts concerning the County’s affirmative action plans.\n\nAll parties agree that the County had affirmative action plans in place at the time of\n\nthe Fire and Rescue Division’s reorganization, and that those plans were applicable\n\nto the Division. Bass showed that in November 1990, the Board of County\n\nCommissioners adopted a five-year affirmative action plan. The plan stated that\n\nthe underutilization of blacks and Hispanics at the Division existed “division\n\nwide.” It set county-wide goals for the hiring of minorities and instructed division\n\ndirectors and department managers to establish annual numerical hiring and\n\npromotion objectives to alleviate the underutilization of women and minorities.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that in July 1993, the County adopted another\n\nplan, the 1993 Diversification Plan, “to ensure that Orange County’s workplace is\n\ndevoid of discrimination and is generally reflective of the County’s diverse\n\npopulation.” The 1993 Diversification Plan required county departments and\n\ndivisions to suspend the hiring process when no qualified minority or female\n\napplicant was available and “provide written justification to the EEO/Professional\n\nStandards Department stating job related reasons why diversity cannot be obtained\n\nvia the particular hiring process.” The 1993 Diversification Plan also set\n\npercentage hiring goals in positions that were found to have few minorities or\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fwomen. That 1993 plan was in effect during the time Bass interviewed for the\n\nTraining Instructor position in October 1995, and it covered hiring at the Fire and\n\nRescue Division. In its response to Bass’ EEOC charge, the County acknowledged\n\nthe existence of an affirmative action plan covering the Division and stated that\n\none of the paramount objectives of the plan was to “increase the percentage of\n\nwomen and minorities in job categories where they have been traditionally\n\nunderrepresented.”\n\n      Although the County clearly had affirmative action plans in place during the\n\n1995 reorganization, it argues, based on testimony from the interview panel\n\nmembers, that the decision not to offer the Training Instructor position to Bass was\n\nunrelated to its affirmative action plans. To support this position, the County\n\npoints to testimony from the panel members indicating that the Training Instructors\n\nwere selected solely on the basis of their interview scores and that no other factors,\n\nsuch as race, were taken into consideration. Valle specifically testified that there\n\nwas no discussion of race at any time. Furthermore, the County notes that the three\n\nTraining Instructors selected represented the top three interview scores of the\n\napplicants who were still in consideration.\n\n      Although the parties dispute whether the Fire and Rescue Division was\n\nacting pursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans, we must bear in mind that\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fthis case is before us at the summary judgment stage. This means the County is\n\nentitled to judgment at this time only if it shows “that there is no genuine issue as\n\nto any material fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Moreover, Bass, as the non-movant, is\n\nentitled to have all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the record drawn in\n\nhis favor. Ryder Int’l Corp. v. First American Nat’l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523\n\n(11th Cir. 1991).\n\n      There is substantial circumstantial evidence in the record upon which a jury\n\nreasonably could conclude that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans. We have outlined above various types of circumstantial\n\nevidence which, independent of the County’s affirmative action plans, permit Bass’\n\nTitle VII claim to go to a jury. That same evidence would permit a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that, despite its denials, the Division was acting pursuant to the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans when it decided to deny Bass a Training\n\nInstructor position during the 1995 reorganization. While the mere existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination, the\n\nexistence of a plan combined with other circumstances of the type present in this\n\ncase make available to a jury the reasonable inference that the employer was acting\n\npursuant to the plan despite statements to the contrary from the decisionmakers\n\ninvolved. Therefore, given the admitted fact that the County had affirmative action\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fplans which were in effect at the time of the actions that are the subject of this\n\nlawsuit, and given the evidence (all of which is circumstantial and some of which\n\nis disputed) that the Division acted pursuant to those affirmative action plans, there\n\nis direct evidence of discrimination.\n\n            c. The Validity of the County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      Ordinarily, if a defendant were found to have acted pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan, the next question would be whether the plan was valid\n\nunder Title VII. The validity of the plan would then be determined under the\n\nfollowing test:\n\n      We must first determine whether the [government employer’s]\n      consideration of the race of promotional candidates was justified by a\n      manifest racial imbalance that reflected under-representation of [the\n      affirmative action plan’s beneficiaries] in traditionally segregated job\n      categories. . . . If such a justification was present when the plan was\n      developed, we must then determine whether the plan itself provides a\n      proper remedy for that imbalance. A remedy is proper if the plan does\n      not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-black employees or create\n      an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 20 F.3d 1525, 1537\n\n(11th Cir. 1994) (citing Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632, 637, 107 S. Ct. at 1452, 1455).\n\n      As we have noted above, however, the County has consistently denied that\n\nthe Fire and Rescue Division acted pursuant to its affirmative action plans with\n\nrespect to Bass. The jury may ultimately choose to believe that this is true. In the\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fevent that the jury disbelieves the County’s denials, however, the County is not\n\nentitled to retrench and argue that its affirmative action plans are valid and\n\nconstitute a defense to the race discrimination claims. The County has put forth no\n\nevidence suggesting that its affirmative action plans could satisfy the requirements\n\nof Title VII, nor has it asked for an opportunity to do so. At no time has the\n\nCounty argued, even in the alternative, that, if Bass is right about the Division’s\n\nactions being a product of the County’s affirmative action plans, the plans were\n\nnevertheless valid. Having chosen its strategic path, the County should not be\n\nallowed to disrupt the orderly course of litigation by belatedly requesting a hearing\n\non or judicial determination about the validity of its affirmative action plans if the\n\nfactual premise of the County’s strategy is rejected by the jury. Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court should instruct the jury that if it finds that the Division acted pursuant\n\nto the County’s affirmative action plans in failing to hire Bass for one of the\n\nTraining Instructor positions, the County is liable under Title VII for\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n                           5. Bass’ Equal Protection Claim\n\n      Next, we consider whether Bass’ § 1983 claim alleging an equal protection\n\nviolation should be permitted to go to a jury. The Supreme Court has held that “all\n\nracial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local government\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\factor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Adarand\n\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2113 (1995); see\n\nalso City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493-94, 109 S. Ct. 706,\n\n721-22 (1989). Strict scrutiny review requires the racial classification to serve a\n\ncompelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at 2113. “[A] free people whose\n\ninstitutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality should tolerate no retreat\n\nfrom the principle that government may treat people differently because of their\n\nrace only for the most compelling reasons.” Id. (citation and internal marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      For the same reasons that the County should be held liable under Title VII if\n\na jury finds that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s affirmative action\n\nplans, we hold that it must also be held liable under § 1983, upon such a finding,\n\nfor violating Bass’ equal protection rights. As we have explained, Bass put forth\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the Division acted pursuant to\n\nthe County’s affirmative action plans in failing to offer him a Training Instructor\n\nposition. Because the County has put forth no evidence showing that its\n\naffirmative action plans satisfy strict scrutiny and has disavowed any reliance on\n\nthose plans, it is fair to assume for purposes of this action that the plans do not\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fsatisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Actions pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan which does not satisfy strict scrutiny constitute unlawful\n\nand unconstitutional discrimination. See, e.g., Adarand , 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.\n\nCt. at 2113. Therefore, the district court should instruct the jury to hold the County\n\nliable under § 1983 if it finds that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans in failing to offer Bass a Training Instructor position.\n\n                           B. RETALIATION CLAIMS\n\n      In addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of\n\nrace, Title VII makes it unlawful:\n\n      for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n      applicants for employment, . . . because he has opposed any practice\n      made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter [of Title\n      VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n      participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n      under this subchapter [of Title VII].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nplaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) there was a causal link between his protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action. See Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 212\n\nF.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir. 2000); Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., 197 F.3d 1322,\n\n1336 (11th Cir. 1999); Little v. United Technologies, 103 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n                                          41\n\f      The district court assumed that Bass had established a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, although it stated that Bass had “difficulty satisfying the third prong of\n\nthe prima facie test,” the causal link. The court then held that the County had\n\narticulated legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its action which Bass failed to\n\nrebut, and as a result the County was entitled to summary judgment on the\n\nretaliation claims. Bass argues that he established a prima facie case and the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to\n\ncreate a jury issue about the County’s proffered reason.\n\n      We will first address Bass’ prima facie case. Bass contends that he engaged\n\nin a protected activity by filing a union grievance in October 1995 in which he\n\ncomplained of racial discrimination in the hiring of the Training Instructors and by\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in December 1995. We need not\n\ndecide whether the filing of the union grievance was a protected activity for anti-\n\nretaliation purposes, because the filing of the EEOC complaint clearly was, and the\n\nbulk of the allegedly retaliatory actions occurred after the filing of the EEOC\n\ncomplaint. See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 160 F.3d 697, 702 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that filing of EEOC complaint is protected activity). Bass thus\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      With respect to the second prong, Bass alleges that he suffered numerous\n\nadverse employment actions. Bass presented evidence that the following actions\n\nwere taken against him after he filed his complaints with the EEOC: (1) he had no\n\nroutine work assignments; (2) he was forced to perform custodial and clerical\n\nduties, and usually was supervised by less senior personnel; (3) he was\n\ncontinuously denied the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-\n\nof classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to other\n\ntraining instructors; (4) he was transferred out of the Training Bureau in January\n\n1997 and was not informed of his new position until April 1997; and in April 1997,\n\nhe was told to report to work in a non-budgeted position that was not covered by\n\nthe union contract; (5) he was ordered to take tests to retain his paramedic pay\n\nwhile other Training Instructors were not required to do so; (6) Chief Smith and\n\nMiddleton ordered him not to record in his work logs the custodial and clerical\n\nwork he performed; and (7) Bass’ training programs, database files for\n\ndocumenting training, and graphic/multimedia material he had developed over a\n\nfive-year period were destroyed\n\n      “An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as\n\ndischarge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\fof employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an\n\nemployee.” Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587 (citation and marks omitted). “Conduct that\n\nfalls short of an ultimate employment decision must meet ‘some threshold level of\n\nsubstantiality . . . to be cognizable under the anti-retaliation clause’” of Title VII.\n\nId. (quoting Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir.\n\n1998)). While “not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action,” Smart v. Ball State Univ., 89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir. 1996),\n\nconduct that alters an employee’s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment does constitute an adverse action under Title VII. See Graham v.\n\nState Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1283 (11th Cir. 1999); Robinson v. City\n\nof Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3d Cir. 1997). The question of whether an\n\nemployee has suffered a materially adverse employment action will normally\n\ndepend on the facts of each individual case. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587.\n\n\n\n      The last two listed actions of which Bass complains – the order not to record\n\ncustodial work in his work log and the destruction of various materials – are not\n\nadverse employment actions. Those actions were not objectively “serious and\n\ntangible enough” to alter Bass’ “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, deprive[] . . . him of employment opportunities or adversely affect . .\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f. his status as an employee.” Robinson, 120 F.3d at 1300 (internal marks omitted).\n\nWe do not see how being told not to record certain tasks on a work log could\n\nconstitute a serious alteration of the terms of Bass’ employment. Also, the\n\nDivision’s disposal of training programs, database files for documenting training,\n\nand graphic/multimedia material prepared by Bass in no way punished or affected\n\nBass’ employment status.\n\n      Having explained why the last two of the seven actions about which Bass\n\ncomplains were not adverse employment actions, we turn now to the remaining\n\nfive. It is undisputed that Bass was not given the same duties as the other Training\n\nInstructors. Bass was given no routine work assignments and was forced to\n\nperform custodial and clerical duties under the supervision of less senior personnel.\n\nThe Division also denied him the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay,\n\nriding-out-of classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to\n\nother Training Instructors. Prior to filing his EEOC complaint alleging racial\n\ndiscrimination, Bass had been permitted to teach adjunct courses and receive pay\n\nfrom agencies other than the Division. After filing that complaint, he was not\n\nallowed to do so. In addition, Bass was ordered to take tests to maintain his\n\nparamedic pay while none of the other Training Instructors were required to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f       We conclude that the Division’s actions which deprived Bass of\n\ncompensation which he otherwise would have earned clearly constitute adverse\n\nemployment actions for purposes of Title VII. See McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d\n\n1558, 1564 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that employee suffered adverse job action\n\nwhere she had fewer responsibilities, was made to perform more menial tasks, and\n\nhad lesser opportunity for salary increases in her new position). While the other\n\nactions might not have individually risen to the level of adverse employment action\n\nunder Title VII, when those actions are considered collectively, the total weight of\n\nthem does constitute an adverse employment action. See Wideman v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998) (“It is enough to conclude, as\n\nwe do, that the actions about which Wideman complains considered collectively\n\nare sufficient to constitute prohibited discrimination. We need not and do not\n\ndecide whether anything less than the totality of the alleged reprisals would be\n\nsufficient.”).\n\n       That brings us to the question of whether there is enough evidence to create\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to the causal connection between Bass’\n\nparticipation in a protected activity and the adverse employment actions. “To\n\nestablish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decisionmakers were\n\naware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\faction were not wholly unrelated.” Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590 (citation and internal\n\nmarks omitted); see also Raney v. Vinson Guard Service, Inc., 120 F.3d 1192,\n\n1197 (11th Cir. 1997) (“a plaintiff must, at a minimum, generally establish that the\n\ndefendant was actually aware of the protected expression at the time the defendant\n\ntook the adverse employment action”). It is not enough for the plaintiff to show\n\nthat someone in the organization knew of the protected expression; instead, the\n\nplaintiff must show that the person taking the adverse action was aware of the\n\nprotected expression. See Raney, 120 F.3d at 1196. This awareness, however,\n\nmay be established by circumstantial evidence. See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore,\n\n996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993). Close temporal proximity between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action may be sufficient to show that the two\n\nwere not wholly unrelated. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590.\n\n      Bass filed his EEOC charge on December 19, 1995. Soon after Bass filed\n\nhis EEOC complaint, he began to suffer adverse employment actions. The close\n\ntemporal proximity between filing of the EEOC complaint and the adverse actions\n\nis sufficient in this case to satisfy the third prong of the prima facie case of\n\nretaliation. See generally Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590. Thus, Bass established a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                           47\n\f      The burden then shifts to the County to set forth a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. The Fire and Rescue Division’s only\n\nreason for not assigning Bass Training Instructor duties was that there was no\n\nvacant district to which to assign him. The County contends that the head of the\n\nTraining Bureau, Chief Willard Smith, decided to keep three districts, instead of\n\ncreating a fourth. It also maintains that Smith decided that only one Training\n\nInstructor should serve each district.\n\n      Bass argues that the County’s articulated reason is insufficient because it\n\naddresses only the failure to assign Bass Training Instructor duties and not the\n\nother alleged retaliatory actions such as being placed in a non-union job and not\n\nbeing allowed overtime pay. Bass further argues that he has shown that the\n\nCounty’s one-instructor-per-district defense is pretext because the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision failed to place Bass in the Training Instructor position that became vacant\n\nin the spring of 1998 and was still vacant as of November 1998. Middleton\n\nconfirmed the existence of the vacancy.\n\n      We agree that the County failed to negate the existence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact concerning a causal connection between all of the adverse actions and\n\nBass’ filing of the EEOC complaint. The County only addressed one part of the\n\nretaliation: the failure to assign Training Instructor duties to Bass. While the “no\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fvacant district” argument may explain his lack of Training Instructor duties and\n\nthus the imposition of clerical duties, it does not explain other adverse employment\n\nactions such as Bass’ transfer to a non-union job, his being denied the opportunity\n\nto teach outside courses, and the testing requirement placed on Bass and not others.\n\nThe County does not attempt to explain those other actions, nor does it explain\n\nwhy Bass was not assigned to the Training Instructor position that became\n\navailable in the spring of 1998. The district court thus erred in granting the\n\nCounty’s motion for summary judgment.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        Although Bass presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of summary judgement\nas to Bass’ retaliation claim under Title VII, we also reverse as to his parallel claim under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act. See supra n.4.\n\n         With respect to Bass’ § 1981 retaliation claim, the situation is less clear. We have\npreviously noted that whether the elements of Title VII and § 1981 retaliation claims are the\nsame is an “open question” in this Circuit. See Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457, 1463\nn.4 (11th Cir. 1998). However, the parties have not raised or argued that issue before us, so we\nwill not attempt to decide it now. If the issue is raised and preserved on remand and survives the\njury trial, it can be addressed in any subsequent appeal.\n\n                                                49\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the\n\nCounty on Bass’ Title VII, § 1981, and Florida Civil Rights Act race\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims, and on his § 1983 equal protection claim.\n\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\n\nCounty and REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f",

For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we reverse and remand for a jury trial on his race discrimination and\n\nretaliation claims.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A. Facts\n\n      In August 1995, the Orange County Fire and Rescue Division (the\n\n“Division” or “Fire and Rescue Division”) began a reorganization of its workforce\n\nas a result of a $9 million budget shortfall. A number of positions were eliminated,\n\nincluding all four Training Captain positions, one of which was held by Michael\n\nBass, the white male plaintiff in this case. Like the other three people employed in\n\nthat position, Bass received a layoff notice in September 1995.\n\n      The four Captain-level positions that were eliminated were replaced with\n\nthree Lieutenant-level Training Instructor positions. Bass applied for one of those\n\nthree positions. In order to become a Training Instructor, the County specified that\n\na person must have “two years training instructor or closely related work\n\n\n                                           2\n\fexperience” and “must possess and maintain a valid Florida Department of\n\nEducation Teacher’s Certificate or obtain [one] within 18 months of employment.”\n\nBass’ qualifications exceeded those minimums. Moreover, according to Frank\n\nMontes de Oca, who was Chief in Charge of Training at the Division, as a training\n\ninstructor Bass “was an excellent employee who constantly received good or\n\noutstanding evaluations.” He was first or second in seniority among instructors,\n\nand, under terms of the union contract, should have been the last or next to last to\n\nbe laid off in the event of a reduction in force.\n\n      All qualified persons, including those who had been laid off, were allowed\n\nto apply for the three Training Instructor positions. The Fire and Rescue Division\n\nused a Performance Based Interview system to select candidates for various\n\npositions, including the Training Instructor positions. In that type of interview,\n\ncandidates are asked pre-selected questions to test their responses to hypothetical\n\nsituations they may face on the job. The candidates are expected to respond by\n\nexplaining what they have done in similar situations.\n\n      A three-member panel interviewed Bass and twelve other applicants for the\n\nthree Training Instructor positions. The members of the interview panel were\n\nCharles Middleton (black male), Ray Valle (Hispanic male), and Betty Meeks\n\n(black female). At the time of the reorganization, Middleton was the Acting\n\n\n                                           3\n\fAssistant Department Manager in charge of Administration and had supervisory\n\nresponsibility over the Division’s Training Instructors. He was also a member of\n\nthe Progressive Firefighters Association, an advocacy organization for black\n\nfirefighters, and he was known to support affirmative action and a promotional\n\n“fast track” for minorities.\n\n       Middleton testified that he selected Meeks and Valle for the interview panel\n\nand that, in doing so, he “[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement\n\nwith the training function” so that they would have had nothing at stake in the\n\nDivision’s reorganization. Meeks was employed in the County’s Human\n\nResources Department, and admits that she had no knowledge beyond that of a lay\n\nperson concerning the position of fire department training instructor. She was also\n\nknown to be a supporter of affirmative action. Although Valle was employed by\n\nthe Division, he worked as an information technology specialist and had no\n\ntraining in firefighting. Nothing in the record indicates Valle’s views on\n\naffirmative action. Therefore, with the possible exception of Middleton,1 none of\n\n\n\n       1\n        The record is less clear with respect to Middleton’s experience and credentials. The\nrecord seems to indicate that Middleton was not a certified firefighter in the State of Florida.\nFurthermore, although the record shows that Middleton had supervisory responsibility over the\nDivision’s Training Instructors, nothing in the record indicates that Middleton had any personal\nexperience as a Training Instructor. Given the procedural posture, of course, we are required to\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Bass. Viewing the evidence that\nway, Middleton was not a certified firefighter and had no experience as a Training Instructor.\n\n                                                4\n\fthe panel members was a certified firefighter in Florida, nor had any panel member\n\nheld a Training Instructor position.\n\n      Not only did the panel members lack experience as Training Instructors,\n\nnone of them was given any training or guidelines (other than general training\n\nconcerning interview skills) to help them evaluate which candidates were best\n\nqualified for the positions. Remarkably, none of them received any job description\n\nshowing the duties of a Training Instructor. Nor did any of them receive the\n\ninterview questions until just before the start of the interviews. They were not told\n\nto take notes of the interviews, and none of them did.\n\n      Mitch Floyd, who was Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1989\n\nuntil April 1995, stated in his affidavit that the County had adopted the interview\n\nprocess “to create some leeway to allow us to promote minority candidates.” He\n\nstated under oath that the interview score was not supposed to be determinative,\n\nbut was meant to be only one of several factors, including education, experience,\n\nand diversity (i.e., race and gender) that were to be considered. The County’s\n\nwritten policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that the\n\ninterview was only one component to be considered. Similarly, Tom Preston (not\n\nrelated to one of the candidates, Henry Preston), who developed the interview\n\nprocess for the Training Instructor position, stated that the interview scores were\n\n\n                                           5\n\fnot intended to be determinative. The interviews for the Training Instructor\n\npositions took place in October 1995. After the panel finished interviewing all the\n\ncandidates, the panel members combined their individual scores for each candidate\n\nand then ranked the candidates based on their aggregate interview scores. The\n\npanel ranked Bass ninth out of the thirteen applicants. Middleton and Valle\n\ntestified that Bass did not answer the questions that were asked and did not\n\ninterview as well as expected considering his experience as a training officer.\n\n(Meeks was not questioned about Bass interview performance during her\n\ndeposition.) Contrary to the written policy and all the testimony about how the\n\ninterview results were to be used, selections for the Training Instructor position\n\nwere made solely on the basis of the interview scores.2 Because Bass received a\n\n       2\n           The interview scores were as follows:\n\nName                   Previously Supervisor           Score   Selected   Race\nGina McCollum                 Yes            16          X           W\nDan Kucik                     No             15                      W\nDonna Reed                    Yes            13          X           W\nHenry Preston                 No             13          X           B\nDavid Cohen                   No             12                      W\nKaren Barber                  No             12                      W\nHenry Butts                   No             11                      W\nJohn Russell                  Yes            10                      B\nMichael Bass                  Yes             8                      W\nVictoria Quick                No              7                      W\nStephen Manning               No              5                      W\nThomas Wheeler                No              4                      W\nTerry Boston                  No              4                      W\n\nThe candidate with the second-highest score, Dan Kucik, was selected for (and accepted) the\n\n                                                   6\n\flow score on the interview, the panel did not choose him for one of the three\n\nTraining Instructor positions. Instead, the panel chose three of the applicants\n\nwhom it had given higher interview scores: a black male and two white females.\n\n       Henry Preston, the black candidate selected for one of the three Training\n\nInstructor positions, did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the position.\n\nHis resume reflected that he had no experience as a Training Instructor and only\n\ntwo years of experience as a firefighter, even though one of the minimum\n\nrequirements for a Training Instructor position was “two (2) years training\n\ninstructor or closely related work experience.” Moreover, Preston misrepresented\n\nhis qualifications both on his general employment application and on his Training\n\nInstructor application. Although Preston represented on those documents that he\n\nattended the University of Central Florida for three years as an accounting major\n\nand earned 94 credits there, he had never attended that university. Preston testified\n\nin his deposition that the County’s Human Resources Department knew he had\n\n“exaggerated” his educational credits. Initially he had submitted an application\n\nwhich truthfully showed he lacked the necessary qualifications, but someone from\n\n\nhigher-ranking position of Group Supervisor. The Group Supervisors were chosen through a\nseparate selection process which involved different PBI interviews. Therefore, Kucik’s\nperformance during his Training Instructor interview does not account for his selection as a\nGroup Supervisor. John Russell (black male), who ranked eighth in the Training Instructor\ninterview was also selected as a Group Supervisor. Bass applied for a Group Supervisor\nposition, but was not selected.\n\n                                               7\n\fHuman Resources told him that his application needed to be changed before it\n\nwould be accepted. Taking the suggestion, Preston submitted a second application,\n\nand this one falsely stated he had attended the University of Central Florida. It was\n\nonly on the basis of that lie about his qualifications, a lie he testified the County\n\nhad encouraged, that Henry Preston was judged to be qualified for a Training\n\nInstructor position.\n\n      After being denied a Training Instructor position for which he was\n\nindisputably qualified, Bass was given the choice of being demoted to\n\nengineer/paramedic or being laid-off. He took the demotion. In October 1995,\n\nBass filed a union grievance challenging his demotion and removal from training\n\nduties. On November 17, 1995, while his grievance was pending, Bass complained\n\nto the Division Chief James Moody that Henry Preston lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position. Bass recorded the events in his\n\ndiary writing as follows:\n\n      Met with Moody. . . . Advised him that Preston, Reed and Kucik did\n      not have an A.S. degree, only high school degree and Reed had a\n      GED and Preston did not qualify for training position. Witnessed by\n      Wertz and Angel Gonzales. Moody advised me that the County will\n      continue to promote based on color and that I should file legal action\n      against the County.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f        In December 1995, the County settled Bass’ union grievance without a\n\nhearing by reassigning him to be a fourth Training Instructor. Bass was given the\n\njob title, rank, and pay of a Training Instructor, but he was not assigned to a district\n\nand was not permitted to perform the duties of a Training Instructor. Before the\n\nreorganization, there were four Training Instructors, each holding the rank of\n\nCaptain, assigned to cover five battalions. After the reorganization, there were\n\nthree Training Instructors, each holding the rank of Lieutenant, assigned to cover\n\nthree districts (as the battalions were renamed). One Training Instructor was\n\nassigned to each of the three districts. As a result, when the Division finally made\n\nBass a Training Instructor he was the fourth one, and there was no vacant district\n\nto assign him.\n\n      In December 1995, on his first day as a Training Instructor, Bass was\n\nassigned to clean out a warehouse – work ordinarily done by inmates supplied by\n\nthe Department of Corrections. Between December 1995 and April 1996, Bass had\n\nno routine work assignments, performed custodial and clerical duties, and usually\n\nwas supervised by personnel who were less senior than he. Middleton, who was\n\nin charge of the Training Instructors, and Chief Smith ordered Bass not to record\n\non his work logs the custodial and clerical work he was performing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      Bass’ non-custodial assignments included working with the Division’s\n\nEmergency Medical Services unit, working on the Community Health Care\n\nInitiative, teaching CPR for Head-start day care workers, and assisting other\n\nTraining Instructors in developing training programs. Bass was not permitted to\n\nearn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of-classification pay, or adjunct teaching\n\npay, all of which were available to the other Training Instructors. Although he\n\npreviously had been permitted to teach numerous outside courses, such as a SWAT\n\nteam tactical rope course offered at various law enforcement agencies, in his\n\nposition as Training Instructor Bass was denied all opportunities to teach outside\n\ncourses. He also was required to take tests in order to retain his paramedic pay,\n\nwhile the three other training instructors were not.\n\n      In January 1997, Bass was transferred out of the Training Bureau without\n\neven being told of the transfer. He learned of the transfer upon returning from\n\nvacation and discovering that his paycheck was no longer available in the Training\n\nBureau and that he was no longer on that bureau’s payroll. From January until\n\nApril of 1997, Bass did not know where he had been transferred or to whom he\n\nwas to report. In April 1997, he was told to report for work in a non-budgeted\n\nposition that was not covered by the union contract. After the union complained,\n\nBass was allowed to keep his Training Instructor title, and he was given a\n\n\n                                          10\n\ftemporary assignment under Chief Weagraff in Quality Assurance. In the spring\n\nof 1998, one of the three budgeted Training Instructor positions became available,\n\nbut it was not given to Bass. In fact, it was never filled. At least as late as\n\nFebruary 1999, Bass was still temporarily assigned to Chief Weagraff.\n\n                                    B. Procedural History\n\n       Bass filed a ten-count complaint against the County on March 31, 1997. The\n\ncomplaint contained race discrimination claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11. The\n\ncomplaint also contained retaliation claims under Title VII; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; the\n\nFlorida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11; and the First\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution; and a claim under Florida’s\n\nveterans’ preference statutes, Fla. Stat. §§ 295.07 & 295.085.3\n\n       The County moved for summary judgment. With respect to the race\n\ndiscrimination claims, the County proffered as its reason for not giving Bass one of\n\n\n\n       3\n          On appeal, Bass does not challenge the district court’s rulings on his Title VI or\nveterans’ preference claims, but argues that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment on his race discrimination and retaliation claims.\n\n                                                11\n\fthe Training Instructor positions his poor performance on the Performance Based\n\nInterview. With respect to Bass’ retaliation claims, the County argued that Bass\n\ncould not establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and that even if he could, he\n\ncould not refute the County’s asserted legitimate reason for its actions – he was not\n\ngiven Training Instructor duties because there was not an open district. The district\n\ncourt entered an order granting summary judgment to the County as to all counts in\n\nthe complaint.\n\n                          II.

RACE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n      In his complaint, Bass alleges that the County discriminated against him\n\nbased on his race (non-Hispanic, white) in violation of Title VII, § 1981, § 1983,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act. Sometimes this type of claim, where a white employee alleges to be\n\nthe victim of discrimination, is referred to as a “reverse discrimination” claim.\n\nWhatever the rhetorical effect of that phrase in the ongoing public debate over\n\naffirmative action may be, it has no place in the legal analysis of the alleged\n\ngovernmental action before us.

Therefore, for\n\npurposes of summary judgment, we assume that Bass is in a protected class, was\n\nqualified to become a Training Instructor, applied for the position, was rejected\n\ndespite his qualifications and was rejected in favor of another less qualified\n\nemployee of a different race. The dispute in this case concerns whether Bass has\n\nalso presented direct evidence of discrimination, and, if not, whether he has put\n\nforth sufficient circumstantial evidence that the County’s proffered non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for its actions (i.e., Bass’ poor performance during his\n\ninterview) was pretextual. We now turn to these disputed issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f   2. Title VII Direct Evidence Contention Based on Chief Moody’s Statements\n\n      First, Bass contends that a statement made to him by Chief Moody – the\n\nchief of the Fire and Rescue Division at the time of the decision not to offer Bass\n\none of the Training Instructor positions during the 1995 reorganization –\n\nconstitutes direct evidence of discrimination. Bass testified that he confronted\n\nChief Moody about the promotion of employees who lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position, and Moody responded that the\n\nCounty would continue to promote based on color. We agree with the district\n\ncourt that this statement does not rise to the level of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination by the Division.\n\n      Direct evidence of discrimination is “evidence which, if believed, would\n\nprove the existence of a fact [in issue] without inference or presumption.” Earley\n\nv.

A.B.E.L.

However, Bass presented no evidence showing that Moody was\n\na decisionmaker or involved in the selection of the Training Instructors. Although\n\nBass attaches significance to the fact that Moody was the chief at the time of the\n\ndecision, the fact remains that Moody was not a member of the interview panel and\n\nwas not involved in the selection process. Only statements by the persons involved\n\nin the decisionmaking process, here the interview panel members, could constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. Therefore, although Moody’s statements may\n\nprovide significant circumstantial support for Bass’ claims, they do not constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1330.\n\n            3. Circumstantial Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      Even though Chief Moody’s statements are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, we believe that Bass has put forth ample circumstantial evidence of\n\n\n                                         19\n\fdiscrimination to permit his Title VII, § 1981 and Florida Civil Rights Act claims\n\nto go to a jury. In addition, for the reasons explained in section 4, infra, we find\n\nthat the County’s affirmative action plans, when viewed in light of the\n\ncircumstantial evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the\n\nDivision was acting pursuant to those plans, do constitute direct evidence of racial\n\ndiscrimination against Bass. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment against Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claims.\n\n      It is undisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of race\n\ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Consequently, a\n\npresumption of discrimination arose and the burden shifted to the County to proffer\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass. See Combs, 106 F. 3d\n\nat 1527-28. To meet that burden of production, the County proffered one reason, a\n\nsubjective one, for not hiring Bass for a Training Instructor position. The County\n\nclaimed that Bass did not score as well on his interview (purportedly the only\n\nselection criterion used) as the other candidates selected for the position.\n\n      This Court recently reaffirmed that a subjective reason for an employer’s\n\naction – such as poor interview performance – can be as legitimate as any other\n\nreason. See Chapman v. AI Transport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770803\"><a href=\"/opinion/770803/john-d-chapman-v-ai-transport/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033 (11th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc). An interview is frequently necessary to assess qualities that are particularly\n\n\n                                          20\n\fimportant in supervisory or professional positions. Id. at 1033. This is because\n\n“[t]raits such as common sense, good judgment, originality, ambition, loyalty, and\n\ntact often must be assessed primarily in a subjective fashion.” Id. at 1034 (internal\n\nmarks and citations omitted). However, in order for a subjective reason to\n\nconstitute a legally sufficient, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the defendant\n\nmust articulate “a clear and reasonably specific factual basis upon which it based\n\nits subjective opinion.” Id.; see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258, 101 S. Ct. at 1096\n\n(“[T]he defendant’s explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and\n\nreasonably specific” so that “the plaintiff be afforded a ‘full and fair opportunity’\n\nto demonstrate pretext.”).\n\n      Although the proffered reason, Bass’ poor interview, was subjective, the\n\nCounty offered explanations of why the interview panel, the decisionmakers,\n\narrived at that subjective conclusion. Valle stated that Bass “did not interview\n\nanywhere near as well as [he] expected him to” and observed that Bass “didn’t\n\nanswer the questions that [the interviewers] were asking.” Middleton opined that\n\nBass “could have presented himself better” and that Bass gave “answers\n\nirrespective of the questions.” Bass’ testimony does not contradict the panel\n\nmembers’ assessment of his interview performance. Bass stated that he “had the\n\nimpression that [the interview] was just some kind of a go-through-the-motion\n\n\n                                          21\n\fthing.” Although Bass admitted that he did not perform well during the interview,\n\nhe claimed that his poor performance was caused by Middleton’s interrupting him\n\nwhile he was trying to answer the questions. Middleton did not recall interrupting\n\nBass during the interview, but Valle testified that if a candidate was “headed in the\n\nwrong direction” the interviewers would “try and help” the candidate by\n\n“clarify[ing] what it was [they] were looking for.”\n\n      Because the interviewers explained the grounds for their subjective\n\nevaluation with reasonable clarity and specificity, the County met its burden of\n\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass as a Training\n\nInstructor. After the County articulated this reason, the burden shifted back to\n\nBass to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact that the\n\nCounty’s non-discriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination. In response,\n\nBass argued that: (1) the County encouraged employees to hire and promote based\n\non race and established a system for hiring and promotion which created leeway so\n\nthat minorities could advance more easily; (2) Chief Moody said that the County\n\nwas going to continue to promote on the basis of color; (3) Preston, the black\n\ncandidate selected as a Training Instructor, did not meet the minimal qualifications\n\nfor the position; (4) the Fire and Rescue Division deviated from its established\n\nprocedures and the interview process was otherwise tainted; and last, but not least,\n\n\n                                          22\n\f(5) the County had in place affirmative action plans with the goal of increasing\n\nminority representation within the Division.\n\n                   a. Pressure to Hire and Promote Minorities\n\n      With respect to Bass’ first pretext argument, he introduced evidence of\n\ncounty officials’ emphasis on hiring and promoting based upon race. Montes de\n\nOca, Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1990 though 1997, testified that\n\nhe was pressured to hire more minorities and that he had received periodic reports\n\nshowing the number of women and blacks in all positions. Mitch Floyd, Chief of\n\nthe Division from 1989 until April 1, 1995, testified that managers’ success or\n\nfailure in meeting the County’s affirmative action goals “could adversely affect\n\ntheir future as managers,” and that the County Administrator, County Chairwoman,\n\nand the County Commission regularly communicated this to the Division\n\nmanagers. From that evidence a jury could reasonably find the County had a\n\npolicy of racial discrimination against non-Hispanic whites.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that the interview system, the same system that\n\nwas used in hiring the Training Instructors, was used to carry out the affirmative\n\naction plans’ goals of emphasizing race in hiring decisions, i.e., the policy of racial\n\ndiscrimination against non-Hispanic whites. Floyd, who developed the interview\n\nsystem for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor positions and who was a\n\n\n                                          23\n\fmember of the Group Supervisor interview panel, testified that Performance Based\n\ninterviews were adopted as a subjective evaluation process that would create\n\n“leeway” in promoting minorities because the County “didn’t have the time or\n\nvacancies to wait out the gradual improvement of skills.”\n\n      This evidence of pressure in the County to hire minorities over non-\n\nminorities, combined with the existence of an interview system adopted in order to\n\ncreate leeway to promote minorities, constitutes circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent behind the Division’s hiring decisions.\n\n       b. Chief Moody’s Statement Concerning Race-Based Promotion\n\n      As to his second pretext argument, Bass testified that when he confronted\n\nChief Moody about Henry Preston’s lacking the requisite qualifications, Moody\n\ntold him that the County would continue to promote on the basis of color. As we\n\nhave already said, because Bass did not introduce sufficient evidence establishing\n\nthat Moody was a decisionmaker, his statement cannot constitute direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Nonetheless, this statement does constitute circumstantial evidence\n\nof discrimination because it raises the inference that the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel members improperly based their decisions on race, rather than\n\nperformance during the interview or other legitimate criteria.\n\n                    c. Promotion of Less-Qualified Candidate\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      In support of his third pretext argument, Bass presented evidence that he was\n\nthe most qualified applicant for the position and that Preston did not even meet the\n\nminimum qualifications for the position. At the time he applied for the Training\n\nInstructor position, Preston’s resume reflected that he had no experience as a\n\nTraining Instructor and only two years of experience with the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision and had earned no credits toward his teaching certificate. It should have\n\nbeen obvious on the face of Preston’s application that he could not meet the\n\nmandatory criterion of obtaining a Florida teaching certification within 18 months\n\nof being promoted and that he lacked the requisite two years of Training Instructor\n\nexperience.\n\n      Hiring a less qualified person can support an inference of discriminatory\n\nmotivation.

Fulton County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74381\"><a href=\"/opinion/74381/alexander-v-fulton-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (“both the Supreme Court and this court have observed that evidence\n\nshowing an employer hired a less qualified applicant over the plaintiff may be\n\nprobative of whether the employer's proffered reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nwas pretextual”); Walker v.

Here, the fact that the Division\n\npromoted Preston, an employee who was unqualified under the Division’s criteria,\n\nover Bass supports an inference of discrimination. This inference is further\n\nstrengthened by Chief Moody’s statement that the County would continue to\n\npromote based on race and by other circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                     d. Deviation from Standard Procedure\n\n      In support of his fourth pretext argument, Bass presented evidence indicating\n\nthat the Fire and Rescue Division departed from its standard procedure when it\n\ninterviewed the applicants for the Training Instructor positions. Tom Preston, who\n\ndeveloped the interview process for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor\n\npositions, testified that interview scores were not intended to be determinative, and\n\nthe interview policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that\n\nthe interview was only one component to be considered. The policy, which was\n\nidentified in deposition by Valle, included the following instructions:\n\n      NOTE: Do not total scores. This process is intended to develop a\n      profile, highlighting a candidate’s areas of strength and weakness.\n      This process was designed as one component to be used in\n      conjunction with other criteria to determine a final selection.\n\nThe Division violated these written procedures by totaling the scores and relying\n\nexclusively upon the interviews. An employer’s violation of its own normal hiring\n\nprocedure may be evidence of pretext. See Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 885\n\n                                          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (11th Cir. 1989). We believe that this is especially true where, as\n\nhere, an employer disregards all but one of the factors and qualifications generally\n\ntaken into consideration and relies solely on a factor which was designed to create\n\n“leeway” for the promotion of people of a certain race.\n\n      Furthermore, other facts surrounding the interview process used in selecting\n\nthe Training Instructors indicate that the process was suspect. For example, the\n\ninterviewers, who were the sole decisionmakers, received no training or guidelines\n\nto help them evaluate which candidates were best qualified for the Training\n\nInstructor positions. The interviewers were supposed to evaluate the applicants’\n\nresponses to certain situations to determine which candidates would make the best\n\nTraining Instructors, yet the interviewers were never even informed of what duties\n\na Training Instructor had. Although Middleton testified that he had at some time\n\nreceived training in the interview process itself, he said he received no training\n\nwith respect to the specific qualifications to look for when interviewing the\n\nTraining Instructor applicants. Valle, another member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that he knew very little about firefighter training at the\n\ntime he served on the panel. Meeks, the final member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that she had no knowledge of firefighting or training\n\nwhen she served on the panel. Furthermore, despite the fact that the panel\n\n\n                                           27\n\fmembers were called upon to judge the applicants’ qualifications to be Training\n\nInstructors, Middleton, who chose the other two panel members, testified that he\n\n“[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement with the training\n\nfunction.”\n\n      We recognize that “a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or\n\nbad reason without violating federal law” and “[w]e are not in the business of\n\nadjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.” Damon v. Fleming\n\nSupermarkets of Florida, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999). We are,\n\nhowever, in the business of adjudging whether an employer violated Title VII by\n\nimproperly making employment decisions on account of race. In this case, the\n\nselection process employed by the Division, when viewed in light of the other\n\nevidence of the County’s race-conscious hiring and promotion efforts, constituted\n\ncircumstantial evidence that the Division was acting with race in mind while\n\nselecting Training Instructors.\n\n                    e. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      The last category of evidence that the proffered interview reason was pretext\n\nis the County’s affirmative action plans, which were in effect at the time that the\n\nFire and Rescue Division refused Bass a Training Instructor position. As we will\n\nexplain in the next section, we think the County’s affirmative action plans are\n\n\n                                          28\n\factually direct evidence of discrimination. But if they were not direct evidence,\n\nthey would certainly be strong circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                                        f. Conclusion\n\n       We conclude that the evidence offered by Bass was more than sufficient to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact about whether the County’s articulated\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for not hiring him was pretextual. The county officials’\n\nemphasis on promoting employees based upon race, the statement by Chief Moody\n\nconcerning race-conscious efforts, the Division’s deviation from procedures, the\n\nhiring of an unqualified candidate instead of Bass, and the existence of formal\n\naffirmative action plans provide more than enough evidence for a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that the County’s proffered non-discriminatory explanation for its\n\nactions was pretextual. The district court erred when it granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of the County on Bass’ race discrimination claims under Title VII, § 1981\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act.4\n\n                   4. Direct Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n       4\n        Although Bass has presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, we have recognized that “decisions construing Title VII are applicable\nwhen considering claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act. . . . ” Harper v. Blockbuster\nEntertainment Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752932\"><a href=\"/opinion/752932/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-854-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45328-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998). Likewise, “[t]he elements of a\nclaim of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate\ntreatment claim in the employment context.” Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771157\"><a href=\"/opinion/771157/deborah-rice-lamar-v-city-of-fort-lauderdale-florida-a-municipality/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843 n.11 (11th Cir. 2000). Therefore, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgement as to Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claim, we also reverse as to his\nrace discrimination claims brought under the Florida Civil Rights Act and § 1981.\n\n                                               29\n\f      We now turn to the consideration of the County’s affirmative action plans as\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination supporting Bass’ Title VII, § 1981 and Florida\n\nCivil Rights Act claims. The affirmative action issues in this case arise in a\n\nsomewhat unusual posture. In a typical Title VII case involving an affirmative\n\naction plan, an employer asserts in response to a plaintiff’s prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination that its employment decision was made pursuant to an affirmative\n\naction plan and that its compliance with such a plan was a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See, e.g., Johnson v. Transportation\n\nAgency, Santa Clara County, Calif., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626-27, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question in those circumstances is whether the employer’s affirmative\n\naction plan is valid.\n\n      In this case, the County seeks no cover from its affirmative action plans\n\n(and, in fact, seems to distance itself from them), and it is Bass who relies on the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans in support of his claims. Of course, a defendant\n\nwho in fact acts pursuant to an affirmative action plan cannot avoid judicial review\n\nof the plan by disavowing reliance upon it, where there is evidence that the plan\n\nplayed a part in the employment decision.\n\n      The first step in ascertaining whether the County can be held liable for\n\ndiscrimination as a result of its affirmative action plans is a determination of\n\n\n                                          30\n\fwhether there is sufficient evidence that it acted pursuant to those plans. The mere\n\nexistence of an affirmative action plan by itself does not constitute direct evidence\n\nof discrimination unless there is also evidence that the employer acted pursuant to\n\nthe plan in making employment decisions.

See McGarry v. Board of County\n\nComm’rs of Pitkin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157895\"><a href=\"/opinion/157895/mcgarry-v-pitkin-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1200 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that county\n\npersonnel director’s statements that those hired were not better qualified than white\n\napplicant and that those hirings were minority affirmative action hirings, made\n\nagainst the backdrop of the county’s policy statements regarding hiring and\n\naffirmative action, constituted direct evidence of discrimination). Furthermore,\n\neven when a defendant denies having acted pursuant to its affirmative action plan,\n\nif there is evidence that it may have done so, a jury must decide whether the\n\ndefendant in fact acted pursuant to its stated plan. See Messer v. Meno, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n                                          <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f130, 139 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding that jury could conclude that defendant acted\n\npursuant to affirmative action plan in light of circumstantial evidence even though\n\ndefendant denied having taken plan into account). When a jury finds that a\n\ngovernment employer acted pursuant to an affirmative action plan, then the\n\nemployer should be held liable for discrimination unless the plan satisfies the\n\ndemanding scrutiny required by Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause. This is\n\nbecause, regardless of good intentions, a government employer commits unlawful\n\ndiscrimination when it takes race into account in an employment decision and acts\n\npursuant to an invalid affirmative action plan.5\n\n      a. Meaning of “Direct Evidence” in Context of Discrimination Claim\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we hold that where there is an affirmative action\n\nplan in effect that relates to the employer’s actions which are the subject of a\n\ndiscrimination claim, the affirmative action plan constitutes direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to permit a jury\n\n\n       5\n         In another case recently before this Court, a plaintiff in a race discrimination lawsuit\nsought summary judgment as to the employer’s liability based on its undisputed compliance with\nits affirmative action plan. See Thigpen v. Bibb County, Sheriff’s Dep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770087\"><a href=\"/opinion/770087/william-t-thigpen-jr-and-james-w-allen-v-bibb-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244\n(11th Cir. 2000). Although we did not rule out that such a finding of liability might be\nappropriate in some cases, we noted that an affirmative action plan “does not necessarily offend\nthe equal protection clause,” and remanded that case for a determination of whether the\naffirmative action plan passed muster under strict scrutiny analysis. Id. Our analysis in Thigpen\nleaves open the possibility, however, that summary judgment as to liability for discrimination\nmight be appropriate where there is no dispute over whether a defendant was acting pursuant to\nan affirmative action plan, if a district court determines that the affirmative action plan is invalid\nunder Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                                 32\n\freasonably to conclude that the employer was acting pursuant to its plan in taking\n\nthe employment action in question.\n\n      Because we believe that the phrase has been a source of confusion, we begin\n\nby discussing the meaning of “direct evidence” in the context of a Title VII race\n\ndiscrimination claim. First, we note that the phrase “direct evidence,” when used\n\nin the context of discrimination claims, does not refer to whether evidence is direct\n\nor circumstantial in the ordinary evidentiary sense in which we normally think of\n\nthose terms. Instead, “direct evidence” refers to a type of evidence which, if true,\n\nwould require no inferential leap in order for a court to find discrimination. We do\n\nnot believe that the status of evidence as “direct” in this context, however, changes\n\nsimply because a defendant contests the validity of the evidence, thereby requiring\n\nthe plaintiff to offer proof related to the disputed evidence through other means.\n\nTherefore, an affirmative action plan may constitute direct evidence, even when a\n\ndefendant denies having acted pursuant to its stated plan.\n\n      This view of direct evidence is supported by this Court’s case law\n\naddressing other types of direct evidence of discrimination. We have held that\n\n“[w]here the non-movant presents direct evidence that, if believed by the jury,\n\nwould be sufficient to win at trial, summary judgment is not appropriate even\n\nwhere the movant presents conflicting evidence.” Mize v.

Therefore, “direct\n\nevidence” of discrimination may be disputed, and it may well be that a plaintiff\n\nwill have to establish the “direct evidence” by introducing circumstantial evidence.\n\nFor example, in Merritt, we considered whether an alleged statement by an\n\nemployer constituted direct evidence in support of the plaintiff’s retaliation claim.\n\nMerritt, 120 F.3d at 1189-91. In that case, the employer denied that a\n\ndecisionmaker had made a statement which, if true, clearly showed a retaliatory\n\nmotive behind the termination of the plaintiff’s employment. Id. Nonetheless, we\n\nconcluded that because the plaintiff could prove – whether by circumstantial\n\nevidence or any other means – that the decisionmaker did make the statement,\n\nthere was direct evidence of retaliation precluding summary judgment. Id. Given\n\nthis approach, we hold, for the following reasons, that Bass has put forth direct\n\nevidence of discrimination in the form of the County’s affirmative action plans\n\neven though there is conflicting evidence concerning whether the Division acted\n\npursuant to those plans.\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f                   b. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      We begin with the facts concerning the County’s affirmative action plans.\n\nAll parties agree that the County had affirmative action plans in place at the time of\n\nthe Fire and Rescue Division’s reorganization, and that those plans were applicable\n\nto the Division. Bass showed that in November 1990, the Board of County\n\nCommissioners adopted a five-year affirmative action plan. The plan stated that\n\nthe underutilization of blacks and Hispanics at the Division existed “division\n\nwide.” It set county-wide goals for the hiring of minorities and instructed division\n\ndirectors and department managers to establish annual numerical hiring and\n\npromotion objectives to alleviate the underutilization of women and minorities.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that in July 1993, the County adopted another\n\nplan, the 1993 Diversification Plan, “to ensure that Orange County’s workplace is\n\ndevoid of discrimination and is generally reflective of the County’s diverse\n\npopulation.” The 1993 Diversification Plan required county departments and\n\ndivisions to suspend the hiring process when no qualified minority or female\n\napplicant was available and “provide written justification to the EEO/Professional\n\nStandards Department stating job related reasons why diversity cannot be obtained\n\nvia the particular hiring process.” The 1993 Diversification Plan also set\n\npercentage hiring goals in positions that were found to have few minorities or\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fwomen. That 1993 plan was in effect during the time Bass interviewed for the\n\nTraining Instructor position in October 1995, and it covered hiring at the Fire and\n\nRescue Division. In its response to Bass’ EEOC charge, the County acknowledged\n\nthe existence of an affirmative action plan covering the Division and stated that\n\none of the paramount objectives of the plan was to “increase the percentage of\n\nwomen and minorities in job categories where they have been traditionally\n\nunderrepresented.”\n\n      Although the County clearly had affirmative action plans in place during the\n\n1995 reorganization, it argues, based on testimony from the interview panel\n\nmembers, that the decision not to offer the Training Instructor position to Bass was\n\nunrelated to its affirmative action plans. To support this position, the County\n\npoints to testimony from the panel members indicating that the Training Instructors\n\nwere selected solely on the basis of their interview scores and that no other factors,\n\nsuch as race, were taken into consideration. Valle specifically testified that there\n\nwas no discussion of race at any time. Furthermore, the County notes that the three\n\nTraining Instructors selected represented the top three interview scores of the\n\napplicants who were still in consideration.\n\n      Although the parties dispute whether the Fire and Rescue Division was\n\nacting pursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans, we must bear in mind that\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fthis case is before us at the summary judgment stage. This means the County is\n\nentitled to judgment at this time only if it shows “that there is no genuine issue as\n\nto any material fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Moreover, Bass, as the non-movant, is\n\nentitled to have all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the record drawn in\n\nhis favor. Ryder Int’l Corp. v. First American Nat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1523\n\n(11th Cir. 1991).\n\n      There is substantial circumstantial evidence in the record upon which a jury\n\nreasonably could conclude that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans. We have outlined above various types of circumstantial\n\nevidence which, independent of the County’s affirmative action plans, permit Bass’\n\nTitle VII claim to go to a jury. That same evidence would permit a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that, despite its denials, the Division was acting pursuant to the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans when it decided to deny Bass a Training\n\nInstructor position during the 1995 reorganization. While the mere existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination, the\n\nexistence of a plan combined with other circumstances of the type present in this\n\ncase make available to a jury the reasonable inference that the employer was acting\n\npursuant to the plan despite statements to the contrary from the decisionmakers\n\ninvolved. Therefore, given the admitted fact that the County had affirmative action\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fplans which were in effect at the time of the actions that are the subject of this\n\nlawsuit, and given the evidence (all of which is circumstantial and some of which\n\nis disputed) that the Division acted pursuant to those affirmative action plans, there\n\nis direct evidence of discrimination.\n\n            c. The Validity of the County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      Ordinarily, if a defendant were found to have acted pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan, the next question would be whether the plan was valid\n\nunder Title VII. The validity of the plan would then be determined under the\n\nfollowing test:\n\n      We must first determine whether the [government employer’s]\n      consideration of the race of promotional candidates was justified by a\n      manifest racial imbalance that reflected under-representation of [the\n      affirmative action plan’s beneficiaries] in traditionally segregated job\n      categories. . . . If such a justification was present when the plan was\n      developed, we must then determine whether the plan itself provides a\n      proper remedy for that imbalance. A remedy is proper if the plan does\n      not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-black employees or create\n      an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667173\"><a href=\"/opinion/667173/in-re-birmingham-reverse-discrimination-employment-litigation-james-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1537\n\n(11th Cir. 1994) (citing Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632, 637, 107 S. Ct. at 1452, 1455).\n\n      As we have noted above, however, the County has consistently denied that\n\nthe Fire and Rescue Division acted pursuant to its affirmative action plans with\n\nrespect to Bass. The jury may ultimately choose to believe that this is true. In the\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fevent that the jury disbelieves the County’s denials, however, the County is not\n\nentitled to retrench and argue that its affirmative action plans are valid and\n\nconstitute a defense to the race discrimination claims. The County has put forth no\n\nevidence suggesting that its affirmative action plans could satisfy the requirements\n\nof Title VII, nor has it asked for an opportunity to do so. At no time has the\n\nCounty argued, even in the alternative, that, if Bass is right about the Division’s\n\nactions being a product of the County’s affirmative action plans, the plans were\n\nnevertheless valid. Having chosen its strategic path, the County should not be\n\nallowed to disrupt the orderly course of litigation by belatedly requesting a hearing\n\non or judicial determination about the validity of its affirmative action plans if the\n\nfactual premise of the County’s strategy is rejected by the jury. Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court should instruct the jury that if it finds that the Division acted pursuant\n\nto the County’s affirmative action plans in failing to hire Bass for one of the\n\nTraining Instructor positions, the County is liable under Title VII for\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n                           5.

Strict scrutiny review requires the racial classification to serve a\n\ncompelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at 2113. “[A] free people whose\n\ninstitutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality should tolerate no retreat\n\nfrom the principle that government may treat people differently because of their\n\nrace only for the most compelling reasons.” Id. (citation and internal marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      For the same reasons that the County should be held liable under Title VII if\n\na jury finds that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s affirmative action\n\nplans, we hold that it must also be held liable under § 1983, upon such a finding,\n\nfor violating Bass’ equal protection rights. As we have explained, Bass put forth\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the Division acted pursuant to\n\nthe County’s affirmative action plans in failing to offer him a Training Instructor\n\nposition. Because the County has put forth no evidence showing that its\n\naffirmative action plans satisfy strict scrutiny and has disavowed any reliance on\n\nthose plans, it is fair to assume for purposes of this action that the plans do not\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\fsatisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Actions pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan which does not satisfy strict scrutiny constitute unlawful\n\nand unconstitutional discrimination. See, e.g., Adarand , 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.\n\nCt. at 2113. Therefore, the district court should instruct the jury to hold the County\n\nliable under § 1983 if it finds that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans in failing to offer Bass a Training Instructor position.\n\n                           B. RETALIATION CLAIMS\n\n      In addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of\n\nrace, Title VII makes it unlawful:\n\n      for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n      applicants for employment, . . . because he has opposed any practice\n      made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter [of Title\n      VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n      participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n      under this subchapter [of Title VII].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nplaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) there was a causal link between his protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action.

The court then held that the County had\n\narticulated legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its action which Bass failed to\n\nrebut, and as a result the County was entitled to summary judgment on the\n\nretaliation claims. Bass argues that he established a prima facie case and the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to\n\ncreate a jury issue about the County’s proffered reason.\n\n      We will first address Bass’ prima facie case. Bass contends that he engaged\n\nin a protected activity by filing a union grievance in October 1995 in which he\n\ncomplained of racial discrimination in the hiring of the Training Instructors and by\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in December 1995. We need not\n\ndecide whether the filing of the union grievance was a protected activity for anti-\n\nretaliation purposes, because the filing of the EEOC complaint clearly was, and the\n\nbulk of the allegedly retaliatory actions occurred after the filing of the EEOC\n\ncomplaint. See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that filing of EEOC complaint is protected activity). Bass thus\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      With respect to the second prong, Bass alleges that he suffered numerous\n\nadverse employment actions. Bass presented evidence that the following actions\n\nwere taken against him after he filed his complaints with the EEOC: (1) he had no\n\nroutine work assignments; (2) he was forced to perform custodial and clerical\n\nduties, and usually was supervised by less senior personnel; (3) he was\n\ncontinuously denied the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-\n\nof classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to other\n\ntraining instructors; (4) he was transferred out of the Training Bureau in January\n\n1997 and was not informed of his new position until April 1997; and in April 1997,\n\nhe was told to report to work in a non-budgeted position that was not covered by\n\nthe union contract; (5) he was ordered to take tests to retain his paramedic pay\n\nwhile other Training Instructors were not required to do so; (6) Chief Smith and\n\nMiddleton ordered him not to record in his work logs the custodial and clerical\n\nwork he performed; and (7) Bass’ training programs, database files for\n\ndocumenting training, and graphic/multimedia material he had developed over a\n\nfive-year period were destroyed\n\n      “An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as\n\ndischarge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\fof employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an\n\nemployee.” Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587 (citation and marks omitted). “Conduct that\n\nfalls short of an ultimate employment decision must meet ‘some threshold level of\n\nsubstantiality . . . to be cognizable under the anti-retaliation clause’” of Title VII.\n\nId.

The question of whether an\n\nemployee has suffered a materially adverse employment action will normally\n\ndepend on the facts of each individual case. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587.\n\n\n\n      The last two listed actions of which Bass complains – the order not to record\n\ncustodial work in his work log and the destruction of various materials – are not\n\nadverse employment actions. Those actions were not objectively “serious and\n\ntangible enough” to alter Bass’ “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, deprive[] . . . him of employment opportunities or adversely affect . .\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f. his status as an employee.” Robinson, 120 F.3d at 1300 (internal marks omitted).\n\nWe do not see how being told not to record certain tasks on a work log could\n\nconstitute a serious alteration of the terms of Bass’ employment. Also, the\n\nDivision’s disposal of training programs, database files for documenting training,\n\nand graphic/multimedia material prepared by Bass in no way punished or affected\n\nBass’ employment status.\n\n      Having explained why the last two of the seven actions about which Bass\n\ncomplains were not adverse employment actions, we turn now to the remaining\n\nfive. It is undisputed that Bass was not given the same duties as the other Training\n\nInstructors. Bass was given no routine work assignments and was forced to\n\nperform custodial and clerical duties under the supervision of less senior personnel.\n\nThe Division also denied him the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay,\n\nriding-out-of classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to\n\nother Training Instructors. Prior to filing his EEOC complaint alleging racial\n\ndiscrimination, Bass had been permitted to teach adjunct courses and receive pay\n\nfrom agencies other than the Division. After filing that complaint, he was not\n\nallowed to do so. In addition, Bass was ordered to take tests to maintain his\n\nparamedic pay while none of the other Training Instructors were required to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f       We conclude that the Division’s actions which deprived Bass of\n\ncompensation which he otherwise would have earned clearly constitute adverse\n\nemployment actions for purposes of Title VII. See McCabe v. Sharrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659889\"><a href=\"/opinion/659889/ellen-d-mccabe-v-ce-sharrett-jr-chief-of-police-city-of-plantation/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1564 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that employee suffered adverse job action\n\nwhere she had fewer responsibilities, was made to perform more menial tasks, and\n\nhad lesser opportunity for salary increases in her new position). While the other\n\nactions might not have individually risen to the level of adverse employment action\n\nunder Title VII, when those actions are considered collectively, the total weight of\n\nthem does constitute an adverse employment action. See Wideman v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753706\"><a href=\"/opinion/753706/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1506-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45384-23-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998) (“It is enough to conclude, as\n\nwe do, that the actions about which Wideman complains considered collectively\n\nare sufficient to constitute prohibited discrimination.

It is not enough for the plaintiff to show\n\nthat someone in the organization knew of the protected expression; instead, the\n\nplaintiff must show that the person taking the adverse action was aware of the\n\nprotected expression. See Raney, 120 F.3d at 1196. This awareness, however,\n\nmay be established by circumstantial evidence. See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609835\"><a href=\"/opinion/609835/62-fair-emplpraccas-bna-769-63-empl-prac-dec-p-42642-delphine/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993). Close temporal proximity between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action may be sufficient to show that the two\n\nwere not wholly unrelated. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590.\n\n      Bass filed his EEOC charge on December 19, 1995. Soon after Bass filed\n\nhis EEOC complaint, he began to suffer adverse employment actions. The close\n\ntemporal proximity between filing of the EEOC complaint and the adverse actions\n\nis sufficient in this case to satisfy the third prong of the prima facie case of\n\nretaliation. See generally Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590. Thus, Bass established a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                           47\n\f      The burden then shifts to the County to set forth a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. The Fire and Rescue Division’s only\n\nreason for not assigning Bass Training Instructor duties was that there was no\n\nvacant district to which to assign him. The County contends that the head of the\n\nTraining Bureau, Chief Willard Smith, decided to keep three districts, instead of\n\ncreating a fourth. It also maintains that Smith decided that only one Training\n\nInstructor should serve each district.\n\n      Bass argues that the County’s articulated reason is insufficient because it\n\naddresses only the failure to assign Bass Training Instructor duties and not the\n\nother alleged retaliatory actions such as being placed in a non-union job and not\n\nbeing allowed overtime pay. Bass further argues that he has shown that the\n\nCounty’s one-instructor-per-district defense is pretext because the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision failed to place Bass in the Training Instructor position that became vacant\n\nin the spring of 1998 and was still vacant as of November 1998. Middleton\n\nconfirmed the existence of the vacancy.\n\n      We agree that the County failed to negate the existence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact concerning a causal connection between all of the adverse actions and\n\nBass’ filing of the EEOC complaint. The County only addressed one part of the\n\nretaliation: the failure to assign Training Instructor duties to Bass. While the “no\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fvacant district” argument may explain his lack of Training Instructor duties and\n\nthus the imposition of clerical duties, it does not explain other adverse employment\n\nactions such as Bass’ transfer to a non-union job, his being denied the opportunity\n\nto teach outside courses, and the testing requirement placed on Bass and not others.\n\nThe County does not attempt to explain those other actions, nor does it explain\n\nwhy Bass was not assigned to the Training Instructor position that became\n\navailable in the spring of 1998. The district court thus erred in granting the\n\nCounty’s motion for summary judgment.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        Although Bass presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of summary judgement\nas to Bass’ retaliation claim under Title VII, we also reverse as to his parallel claim under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act. See supra n.4.\n\n         With respect to Bass’ § 1981 retaliation claim, the situation is less clear. We have\npreviously noted that whether the elements of Title VII and § 1981 retaliation claims are the\nsame is an “open question” in this Circuit. See Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753707\"><a href=\"/opinion/753707/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1833-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45540-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1463\nn.4 (11th Cir. 1998).
