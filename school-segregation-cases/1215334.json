But the\nplaintiffs do not claim that the Navy actually discriminated\nagainst any of them. We conclude that plaintiffs lack\nstanding to bring this claim, and we therefore affirm the\njudgment of the District Court.\n\n                               I\n\n     The U.S. Navy maintains a Chaplain Corps of\ncommissioned Navy officers to meet the spiritual needs of\nthose who serve in the Navy and their families. Like other\nofficers, chaplains are subject to military regulations with\nrespect to hiring, promotion, and retirement.\n\n    The Navy divides its chaplains into four categories –\nCatholic, liturgical Protestant, non-liturgical Protestant, and\nSpecial Worship. As we explained in a previous opinion in\nthis litigation, “liturgical Protestant” includes Protestant\ndenominations that follow an established liturgy in worship\nservices and practice infant baptism, such as Lutheran,\nEpiscopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational.\nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d\n\f                                 3\n290, 294 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Chaplaincy). “Non-liturgical\nProtestant” includes Protestant denominations that do not\nfollow a formal liturgy in worship services and that baptize at\nthe age of reason, such as Baptist, Evangelical, Pentecostal,\nand Charismatic. Id. at 294. The “Special Worship” category\nrefers to other religious faiths, both Christian and non-\nChristian, and it includes Jewish, Christian Science, Seventh-\nDay Adventist, Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim,\nJehovah’s Witness, and Unitarian. Id. at 295 n.3.\n\n    Plaintiffs are non-liturgical Protestant Navy chaplains,\nboth current and retired.1 Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the\nNavy discriminates in favor of Catholic chaplains in certain\naspects of its retirement system. See In re Navy Chaplaincy,\nNo. 07-ms-269, slip op. at 1 (D.D.C. Oct. 15, 2007).\nPlaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction.\n\n     The District Court initially denied plaintiffs’ preliminary\ninjunction motion, finding that the chaplains had not shown\nthe necessary irreparable injury to support a preliminary\ninjunction. See Adair v. England, Nos. 00-cv-566 & 99-cv-\n2945, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2005). On appeal, this\nCourt reversed, explaining that, for purposes of a preliminary\ninjunction, the allegation of an Establishment Clause violation\nitself demonstrates sufficient harm to satisfy the irreparable\ninjury prong of the preliminary injunction test – assuming, of\ncourse, that the party has standing to allege the violation in\nthe first place. See Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 303-04 & n.8.\nThe Court therefore vacated the denial of a preliminary\n\n    1\n      Plaintiffs also include certain organizations of non-liturgical\nProtestant chaplains. Because the organizations have standing in\nthese circumstances only if one of their individual members has\nstanding, we do not address them separately. See Hunt v.\nWashington State Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 342-43\n(1977).\n\f                                 4\ninjunction and remanded for the District Court to consider the\nremaining factors in the preliminary injunction analysis,\nincluding likelihood of success on the merits. See id. at 304-\n05.\n\n    On remand, in a well-reasoned opinion, the District Court\nconcluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this claim.\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                 II\n\n     Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power to\ndeciding “Cases” and “Controversies.”             “One of the\ncontrolling elements in the definition of a case or controversy\nunder Article III is standing.” Hein v. Freedom from Religion\nFoundation, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2553, 2562 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).2 The three factors\nestablishing the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of\nstanding are well established. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). First and most relevant here is\ninjury-in-fact: A would-be plaintiff must have suffered “an\ninvasion of a legally protected interest” that is (i) “concrete\nand particularized” rather than abstract or generalized, and (ii)\n“actual or imminent” rather than remote, speculative,\nconjectural or hypothetical. Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Nat’l Highway Traffic\nSafety Admin., 489 F.3d 1279, 1292-93 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\nSecond is causation: The asserted injury must be “fairly\ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant.” Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Third is redressability: It must be likely that a\n\n    2\n       In referring to Hein throughout our opinion, we are referring\nspecifically to Justice Alito’s opinion, which is the binding opinion\nof the Court in that case. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188,\n193 (1977).\n\f                              5\nfavorable decision by the court would redress the plaintiff’s\ninjury. Id. at 561.\n\n    “[T]he law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic\nidea – the idea of separation of powers.” Allen v. Wright, 468\nU.S. 737, 752 (1984). The doctrine is “founded in concern\nabout the proper – and properly limited – role of the courts in\na democratic society.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498\n(1975). The federal courts are “not empowered to seek out\nand strike down any governmental act that they deem to be\nrepugnant to the Constitution.” Hein, 127 S. Ct. at 2562.\n“Vindicating the public interest (including the public interest\nin Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is\nthe function of Congress and the Chief Executive.” Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 576; see also Valley Forge Christian Coll. v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454\nU.S. 464, 474-75 (1982).\n\n   Those critical and bedrock principles of separation of\npowers inform our approach to plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n                              III\n\n     In reviewing the standing question, we must be “careful\nnot to decide the questions on the merits for or against the\nplaintiff, and must therefore assume that on the merits the\nplaintiffs would be successful in their claims.” City of\nWaukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003). For\npurposes of our analysis in this case, we therefore must\nassume arguendo that the Navy’s operation of its retirement\nsystem favors Catholic chaplains and disfavors non-liturgical\nProtestant chaplains in violation of the “clearest command of\nthe Establishment Clause” – that “one religious denomination\ncannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v.\nValente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982). Even assuming that\nplaintiffs’ allegations are accurate, however, they do not have\n\f                              6\nstanding to bring this claim against the Navy because they\nhave not sufficiently demonstrated their own injury-in-fact.\n\n     If plaintiffs had alleged that the Navy discriminated\nagainst them on account of their religion, plaintiffs would\nhave alleged a concrete and particularized harm sufficient to\nconstitute injury-in-fact for standing purposes. But plaintiffs\nhave conceded that they themselves did not suffer\nemployment discrimination on account of their religion. They\nhave conceded that the Navy did not deny them any benefits\nor opportunities on account of their religion. See In re Navy\nChaplaincy, No. 07-ms-269, slip op. at 7-9 (D.D.C. Oct. 15,\n2007). Rather, they suggest that other chaplains suffered such\ndiscrimination.\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that they nonetheless have standing for\neither of two reasons: (i) they are taxpayers who object to the\nNavy’s allegedly discriminatory operation of its chaplaincy\nprogram, or (ii) they have been subjected to the Navy’s\n“message” of religious preference as a result of the Navy’s\nrunning a retirement system that favors Catholic chaplains.\nWe disagree. Because plaintiffs’ claim does not fit within the\nnarrow confines of Establishment Clause taxpayer standing\npermitted by Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), they do not\nhave standing as taxpayers. See Hein v. Freedom from\nReligion Foundation, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2553, 2562-72 (2007).\nNor do plaintiffs have standing based on their exposure to the\nNavy’s alleged “message” of religious preference.\n\n                              A\n\n     As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, a taxpayer’s\ninterest in ensuring that appropriated funds are spent in\naccordance with the Constitution does not suffice to confer\nArticle III standing. See Hein, 127 S. Ct. at 2563 (2007).\nBack in Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923),\n\f                               7\ntaxpayers sued the Government, arguing that the Maternity\nAct of 1921 improperly invaded powers reserved to States by\nthe Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected taxpayer\nstanding in that case: “The administration of any statute,\nlikely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a\nvast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability\nis indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of\npublic and not of individual concern. If one taxpayer may\nchampion and litigate such a cause, then every other taxpayer\nmay do the same . . . .” Id. at 487; see also Doremus Bd. of\nEduc. v. Hawthorne, 342 U.S. 429, 433-34 (1952).\n\n     In 1968, 45 years after Frothingham, the Supreme Court\ncarved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional\nbar on taxpayer suits; the Court held that federal taxpayers\nhad standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge to\nfederal financing for parochial schools. See Flast, 392 U.S.\n83. But according to Flast, taxpayers may bring an\nEstablishment Clause challenge only when they challenge\nlegislation passed pursuant to the Taxing and Spending\nClause in Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. See id. at 102-03.\n\n     The Court has subsequently made clear that Flast is a\nvery narrow exception to the general bar against taxpayer\nstanding. In Valley Forge, for example, the plaintiffs argued\nthat the Government violated the Establishment Clause when\nit transferred a tract of “surplus property” to a Christian\ncollege. Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for\nSeparation of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464, 467-68 (1982)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court found that the\nplaintiffs, a group composed of “90,000 taxpayer members,”\ndid not have standing both because the challenged action was\nexecutive rather than legislative and because the property\ntransfer was an exercise of executive authority pursuant to\nlegislation passed under the Property Clause in Article IV, § 3\n\f                               8\nof the Constitution rather than the Taxing and Spending\nClause in Article I, § 8. Id. at 469, 479-80 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     In Bowen v. Kendrick, the Supreme Court allowed a\ngroup of federal taxpayers to challenge the Adolescent Family\nLife Act, a statute appropriating funds for religious\norganizations, among others, to fight teen pregnancy. 487\nU.S. 589, 593, 596-97 (1988). The Court found that\nplaintiffs’ claim challenged a program expressly authorized\nby Congress under the taxing and spending power, thus fitting\nwithin Flast. Id. at 619. The key to Bowen’s conclusion, as\nthe Court has subsequently explained, was that the statute was\n‘“at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to\nCongress’ taxing and spending powers’” and that plaintiffs’\nclaims were concerned with the expenditure of funds\n‘“pursuant to the AFLA’s statutory mandate.’” Hein, 127 S.\nCt. at 2567 (quoting Bowen, 487 U.S. at 619-20) (emphasis\nomitted).\n\n     In its recent decision in Hein, the Court declined to\nexpand Flast to encompass discretionary Executive Branch\nspending: “Because almost all Executive Branch activity is\nultimately funded by some congressional appropriation,\nextending the Flast exception to purely executive\nexpenditures would effectively subject every federal action –\nbe it a conference, proclamation or speech – to Establishment\nClause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.” Id. at\n2569. Although Hein did not eliminate the Flast exception to\nthe bar against taxpayer standing, the case forcefully\nemphasized the exception’s extremely limited contours: “It is\nsignificant that, in the four decades since its creation, the\nFlast exception has largely been confined to its facts.” Id. at\n2568-69. As Hein explained, the Court has limited the\n“expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the\n\f                                 9\nabsence of specific statutory authorization to an outer\nboundary drawn by the results in Flast.” Id. at 2569 (internal\nquotation marks and emphasis omitted).3\n\n    In this case, plaintiffs’ claim does not fit within the\nnarrow Flast exception. No legislative enactment expressly\nauthorizes or appropriates funds for the Navy to favor\nCatholic chaplains in its retirement system. Plaintiffs cite, for\nexample, the statutes establishing the Navy Chaplain Corps,\nbut those statutes make no reference to denominational\ncategory, only to chaplains generally. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 5142,\n5150.     And plaintiffs, who themselves are chaplains,\nobviously do not contend that congressional legislation\nestablishing the Navy Chaplaincy itself violates the\nEstablishment Clause; they merely want the Navy to operate\nthe Chaplain Corps differently. Cf. Katcoff v. Marsh, 755\nF.2d 223 (2d Cir. 1985) (approving military chaplaincy\nprogram).\n\n     As in Hein, the challenged expenditures here – extra\nsalary and retirement-related benefits allegedly provided to\nCatholic chaplains – “were not expressly authorized or\nmandated by any specific congressional enactment.” Hein,\n127 S. Ct. at 2568. Indeed, plaintiffs contend that the\nChaplain Corps is being operated by the Navy in\ncontravention of the law, not in accordance with the law. See\nPlaintiffs’ Br. 48 (“Appellees have not followed either the law\n\n    3\n       The Flast exception may be further limited to Congress’s\ndisbursement of federal funds outside the Government. In both\nFlast and Bowen v. Kendrick, the only two Supreme Court cases\nupholding taxpayer standing, the statutes authorized disbursement\nof federal funds to outside entities, including religious\norganizations. But we need not address that question in this case\ngiven that plaintiffs’ argument for taxpayer standing fails at a more\nbasic level.\n\f                              10\nor the DOD regulations.”). Under the Supreme Court’s\nprecedents, that contention directly undermines any claim to\ntaxpayer standing. In sum, plaintiffs do not have standing as\ntaxpayers.\n\n                               B\n\n     Plaintiffs alternatively contend that they have standing\nbecause “Establishment Clause injury flows from the\nforbidden messages of preference or disapproval” inherent in\nthe Navy’s denominational preference. Plaintiffs’ Br. 28. In\nso arguing, they rely primarily on this Court’s decision in\nChaplaincy, which explained that for the purposes of a\npreliminary injunction, the “mere allegation” of an\nEstablishment Clause violation is always sufficient to show\nirreparable harm. Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.\nEngland, 454 F.3d 290, 303-04 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Plaintiffs\nclaim that because their allegations demonstrate irreparable\ninjury for preliminary injunction purposes, they have\nnecessarily shown injury-in-fact for standing purposes.\n\n     But the Court in Chaplaincy merely held that the\nallegation of an Establishment Clause violation is sufficient to\nsatisfy the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary\ninjunction standard – presupposing that a party has standing\nto allege such a violation. See id. at 303-04 & n.8. A per se\nrule defining automatic injury-in-fact for every plaintiff who\nclaims an Establishment Clause violation – as plaintiffs strain\nto find in the Chaplaincy opinion – would run counter to\ndecades of settled jurisprudence setting forth the requirements\nfor standing in Establishment Clause cases. Jurisdictional\nrequirements are not disposed of so easily, and the Court in\nChaplaincy did not purport to make the sweeping change\nattributed to it by plaintiffs.\n\f                              11\n     Apart from citing Chaplaincy, plaintiffs also claim\ninjury-in-fact from their being subjected to the “message” of\nreligious preference conveyed by the Navy’s allegedly\npreferential retirement program for Catholic chaplains. The\nprogram, they say, makes them feel like second-class citizens\nwithin the Navy Chaplaincy even if they themselves have not\nsuffered discrimination on account of their religion.\n\n     As the Supreme Court has often stated, mere personal\noffense to government action does not give rise to standing to\nsue. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752-54 (1984); see also\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 575-76 (1992).\n“By the mere bringing of his suit, every plaintiff demonstrates\nhis belief that a favorable judgment will make him happier.\nBut although a suitor may derive great comfort and joy” from\nknowing that the Government is following constitutional\nimperatives, “that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable\nArticle III remedy because it does not redress a cognizable\nArticle III injury.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t,\n523 U.S. 83, 107 (1998). “Recognition of standing in such\ncircumstances would transform the federal courts into no\nmore than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests\nof concerned bystanders.” Allen, 468 U.S. at 756 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n     Plaintiffs respond that their claim is similar to religious\ndisplay and prayer cases where courts have found (or at least\napparently assumed) standing. See, e.g., McCreary County v.\nACLU, 545 U.S. 844, 851-52 (2005) (Ten Commandments\ndisplays that were “readily visible” to citizens conducting\ncivic business) (internal quotation marks omitted); Van Orden\nv. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 681-82 (2005) (Ten Commandments\ndisplay on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol that\npetitioner frequently encountered); County of Allegheny v.\nACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 578 (1989) (crèche display in county\n\f                               12\ncourthouse and menorah display outside city-county\nbuilding); Suhre v. Haywood County, 131 F.3d 1083, 1086\n(4th Cir. 1997) (Ten Commandments display in county\ncourtroom; noting that display cases are “particularized\nsubclass of Establishment Clause standing jurisprudence”);\nsee also Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 580 (1992)\n(governmental prayer at school graduation); Marsh v.\nChambers, 463 U.S. 783, 784-85 (1983) (daily prayer at\nopening of state legislature); Sch. Dist. of Abington Township\nv. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 205-12 (1963) (daily Bible reading\nin class); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 422-23 (1962)\n(official state prayer in class).\n\n     These Supreme Court cases do not all directly discuss the\nstanding issue. It is a well-established rule that “cases in\nwhich jurisdiction is assumed sub silentio are not binding\nauthority for the proposition that jurisdiction exists.” John\nDoe, Inc. v. DEA, 484 F.3d 561, 569 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, accepting\nthose cases as precedents on standing,4 we nonetheless find\nsignificant differences between plaintiffs’ case and the\nreligious display and prayer cases. In the religious display\nand prayer cases, the Government was actively and directly\ncommunicating a religious message through religious words\nor religious symbols – in other words, it was engaging in\nreligious speech that was observed, read, or heard by the\nplaintiffs in those cases. Here, by contrast, the Navy is not\ncommunicating a religious message through religious words\nor religious symbols. Plaintiffs’ objection here is more akin\nto the objection to the property transfer in Valley Forge,\n    4\n      See generally Doe v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch. Bd., 494 F.3d\n494, 499-502 (5th Cir. 2007) (DeMoss, J., concurring); Ira C. Lupu\n& Robert W. Tuttle, Ball on a Needle: Hein v. Freedom from\nReligion Foundation, Inc. and the Future of Establishment Clause\nAdjudication, 2008 B.Y.U. L. REV. 115, 158-64 (2008).\n\f                              13\nwhere the Court stated that the plaintiffs failed “to identify\nany personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the\nalleged constitutional error, other than the psychological\nconsequence presumably produced by observation of conduct\nwith which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to\nconfer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement\nis phrased in constitutional terms.” Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at\n485-86 (emphasis added and omitted); see also Suhre, 131\nF.3d at 1086 (quoting Valley Forge and stating “a mere\nabstract objection to unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient\nto confer standing”).\n\n     Plaintiffs’ argument would extend the religious display\nand prayer cases in a significant and unprecedented manner\nand eviscerate well-settled standing limitations. Under\nplaintiffs’ theory, every government action that allegedly\nviolates the Establishment Clause could be re-characterized as\na governmental message promoting religion. And therefore\neveryone who becomes aware of the “message” would have\nstanding to sue. The neighbors in Valley Forge, the hotel\nworkers at a conference for faith-based organizations in Hein,\nthe list goes on – all could have obtained standing to sue\nsimply by targeting not the government’s action, but rather\nthe government’s alleged “message” of religious preference\ncommunicated through that action. Indeed, as plaintiffs’\ncounsel acknowledged at oral argument, under plaintiffs’\nstanding theory any recipient of the Navy’s “message” in this\ncase, including the judges on this panel, would have standing\nto bring suit challenging the allegedly discriminatory\nChaplain Corps. Oral Arg. Tr. at 6-7. The jurisdictional\nrequirements of Article III are not so manipulable. They do\nnot allow anyone who becomes aware of a government action\nthat allegedly violates the Establishment Clause to sue over it\non the ground that they are offended by the allegedly\nunconstitutional “message” communicated by that action. In\n\f                              14\nthe government employment context at issue here, it thus\ncomes as no surprise that neither plaintiffs nor the dissent has\ncited any case holding that a plaintiff can maintain a religious\nemployment discrimination suit under the Religion Clauses\nwhen complaining about employment discrimination suffered\nby others, not by the plaintiff himself or herself. We think the\nreason for the dearth of precedent is evident: When plaintiffs\nare not themselves affected by a government action except\nthrough their abstract offense at the message allegedly\nconveyed by that action, they have not shown injury-in-fact to\nbring an Establishment Clause claim, at least outside the\ndistinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.\n\n      To be sure, we recognize that plaintiffs’ creative analogy\nto the religious display and prayer cases has some surface\nlogic. But the implications of plaintiffs’ theory for standing\ndoctrine are quite radical: Plaintiffs seek to use the religious\ndisplay and prayer cases to wedge open the courthouse doors\nto a wide range of plaintiffs alleging Establishment Clause\nviolations who were previously barred by bedrock standing\nrequirements – requirements that are essential to preserving\nthe separation of powers and limited judicial role mandated\nby the Constitution. We decline the invitation to transform\nEstablishment Clause standing doctrine in this way. What the\nSupreme Court said last year in Hein applies just as well to\nplaintiffs’ reliance on the religious display and prayer cases\nhere: “It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of stare\ndecisis that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of\nits logic.” Hein, 127 S. Ct. at 2571.\n\n                             ***\n\n    We affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f     ROGERS, Circuit Judge, dissenting: The Establishment\nClause prevents “the Government’s placing its official stamp of\napproval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular\nform of religious services,” Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 429\n(1962), and ensures that “all creeds . . . be tolerated and none\nfavored,” Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 590 (1992); see\nMcCreary County v. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S.\n844, 860 (2005). A governmental accommodation for religion\nmay violate the Establishment Clause if it “singles out a\nparticular religious sect for special treatment” because\n“whatever the limits of permissible . . . accommodations may be\n. . . , it is clear that neutrality as among religions must be\nhonored.” Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Grumet,\n512 U.S. 687, 706-07 (1994) (citations omitted). “‘When the\npower, prestige and financial support of government [are] placed\nbehind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive\npressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing\nofficially approved religion is plain.’” Sch. Dist. of Abington\nTwp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 221 (1963) (quoting Engel, 370\nU.S. at 430-31).\n\n     In Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454\nF.3d 290 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the court thus observed that the\nliberty interest shielded by the Establishment Clause is\n“protection against government imposition of a state religion or\nreligious preference,” id. at 302 (emphasis added). Stating that\n“the Establishment Clause is implicated as soon as the\ngovernment engages in impermissible action,” id., the court\nexplained that unlike freedom of expression cases, for example,\n“[t]he harm inflicted by religious establishment is self-executing\nand requires no attendant conduct on the part of the individual,”\nid. at 303; see also id. at 302. In describing the impermissible\ngovernment action at issue, the court stated:\n\n         Where, as here, the charge is one of official preference\n\f                                   2\n\n            of one religion over another, such governmental\n            endorsement “sends a message to nonadherents [of the\n            favored denomination] that they are outsiders, not full\n            members of the political community, and an\n            accompanying message to adherents that they are\n            insiders, favored members of the political community.”\n\nId. at 302 (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688 (1984)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)) (alteration in original). The court\nheld that such an allegation sufficed to show irreparable harm,\nor “injury [that is] beyond remediation [by monetary damages],”\nid. at 297, for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief,\ncrediting appellants’ allegation of “the harm that flows from the\n‘forbidden message’ of marginalization [that the Navy’s] actions\nsend to [them],” id. at 299 (quoting Appellants’ Br. at 20). The\ncourt did not expressly hold that appellants1 had Article III\nstanding, but see Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523\nU.S. 83, 94-95 (1998), but noted that its legal “conclusion\npresupposes, of course, that the party has standing to allege such\na violation,” Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 304 n.8.\n\n     The court’s decision in Chaplaincy regarding appellants’\nliberty interest that is protected by the Establishment Clause and\nthe nature of their injury is no less applicable here. The same\nparties and the same charge are involved, see LaShawn A. v.\nBarry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393-95 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc), and\ninjury sufficient for irreparable harm has resonance for injury-\nin-fact under Article III, see Taylor v. Resolution Trust Corp., 56\n\n\n        1\n           Due to the consolidation of three cases, appellants include\nactive duty, reserve, retired, and former non-liturgical Protestant Navy\nchaplains as in Chaplaincy, and two endorsing agencies — Chaplaincy\nof Full Gospel Churches and Associated Gospel Churches.\nHereinafter in referring to “appellants,” I refer only to the chaplains\ncurrently serving in the Navy Chaplain Corps.\n\f                                    3\n\nF.3d 1497, 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1995), because to show irreparable\nharm “[a] plaintiff must do more than merely allege . . . harm\nsufficient to establish standing,” Associated Gen. Contractors of\nCal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1410 (9th\nCir. 1991). As explained in Chaplaincy, “[t]his court has set a\nhigh standard for irreparable injury” within the preliminary\ninjunction inquiry. 454 F.3d at 297. Such injury must be “both\ncertain and great,” “actual and not theoretical,” “beyond\nremediation,” and also “of such imminence that there is a clear\nand present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable\nharm.” Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted). For Article\nIII, the requisite injury-in-fact must be “concrete and\nparticularized” and “actual or imminent,” not “hypothetical.”\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)\n(quotation marks omitted). Because “the Navy’s alleged\nviolation of the Establishment Clause per se constitutes\nirreparable harm,” Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 299, appellants have\nmet their burden on the injury prong of Article III standing.2\n\n     As members of non-liturgical Protestant churches and\nfellowships, appellants assert that the Navy has singled out the\nCatholic faith as the preferred religious tradition in its Chaplain\nCorps by choosing over several decades to allow only Catholic\n\n\n\n        2\n           To the extent the court seeks to avoid this precedent by\ninterpreting a footnote in Chaplaincy to indicate that the court was\n“presupposing” appellants’ standing, Op. at 10, and thus addressing\nthe request for injunctive relief without satisfying itself that appellants\nhad standing, its approach is contrary both to the principle in Steel\nCo., 523 U.S. at 94-95, and to the more natural reading of the footnote\nas merely recognizing, as this court has done before, that this prong of\nthe preliminary injunction inquiry and the entirety of the Article III\nstanding inquiry “overlap[] . . . somewhat,” but are not coextensive,\nsee Taylor, 56 F.3d at 1508.\n\f                                  4\n\nchaplains to serve beyond the required separation dates.3 This\nsends a message of denominational preference for Catholics and\nmarginalization for non-Catholic adherents, causing appellants\nto suffer psychological harm while serving as chaplains. Compl.\n¶¶ 3, 37(e), 39. By endowing Naval officer status in a\npreferential manner upon the representatives of a particular type\nof religious ministry,4 who then, as part of their Naval service\nduties, use words and symbols to serve their religious cause, the\n\n\n        3\n            According to appellants, “the 4109 program” has three\nparts: (1) illegal appointments to active duty through age waivers for\nover-age Catholic clergy, (2) the consequent illegal continuation of\nsuch clergy as chaplains to the age of 67, and (3) the eventual illegal\ntransfer of such clergy to the Retired Reserve and subsequent recall to\nactive duty as designated 4109 Reservists. The program is designed\nin part to allow Catholic chaplains who have reached their statutory\nseparation age to continue to serve until they have completed twenty\nyears of service and become eligible for pensions. See 10 U.S.C. §§\n1251, 14509, 14703; see also Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 293-96. At the\ntime appellants filed their complaints, the age limit for the\nappointment of chaplains, like other officers, was forty-two, see 10\nU.S.C. § 532(a)(2); while this provision is no longer applicable to\nchaplains, id. at § 532(d)(1) (as amended by Ronald W. Reagan\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub. L. No.\n108-375, 188 Stat. 1811, 1872 (Oct. 28, 2004)), the statutory\nseparation age for chaplains and other officers remains in effect.\n\n        4\n          Appellants cite a list of Catholic chaplains coded as “4109”\ncurrently serving with them in the Navy Chaplain Corps, and assert\nthat additional chaplains are destined to become 4109 chaplains in\nview of the Navy’s list of Catholics appointed after age forty-two and\nextended on active duty and the dates they become eligible for\npensions. For example, non-liturgical Protestant Chaplain Stewart\nserved with over-age Catholic Chaplain Erestain. After this court’s\ndecision in Chaplaincy, it appears that the Navy extended two\nnon-Catholic chaplains for service beyond the age of 62. See 454 F.3d\nat 295.\n\f                                  5\n\nNavy allegedly has “take[n] sides in a religious matter,\neffectively discriminating in favor of [one religion’s] view,”\nCommack Self-Serv. Kosher Meats, Inc. v. Weiss, 294 F.3d 415,\n425 (2d Cir. 2002), of the type of religious ministry that is most\nappropriate to serve “the religious needs of sailors,” In re\nEngland, 375 F.3d 1169, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 2004). See, e.g.,\nMcCreary County, 545 U.S. at 860; Kiryas Joel Vill., 512 U.S.\nat 698-705.\n\n     Appellants have suffered particularized Article III injury\nbecause they are not strangers to the Navy’s 4109 program.\nTheir membership within the Chaplain Corps and their resulting\nreceipt of a message of denominational preference make them\ncomparable to a citizen who has “personal contact with the\nalleged establishment of religion,” Suhre v. Haywood County,\n131 F.3d 1083, 1086 (4th Cir. 1997), such as in the religious\ndisplay cases.5 Appellants’ charge does more than present a\n“creative analogy” with “some surface logic,” Op. at 14, as the\ncourt offers no basis for its unsupported conclusion that this case\nis different from “the distinct context of the religious display\nand prayer cases,” id. As counsel for the Navy acknowledged,\n“if a chaplain . . . is personally exposed to a [message of\nreligious preference], there would be traditional standing.” Oral\nArg. Tr. at 13 (Apr. 24, 2008). That is what appellants allege in\n\n        5\n            See, e.g., Vasquez v. L.A. County, 487 F.3d 1246, 1250-51\n(9th Cir. 2007); Doe v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch.

Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 302\n(quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 688 (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\nAppellants’ injury is thus as particularized, see Lujan, 504 U.S.\nat 561 n.1, 573-74; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1975),\nas that of the children in Schempp, 374 U.S. at 223-24, to whom\nschool prayers were read, the plaintiffs in Women’s Equity\nAction League (WEAL) v. Cavazos, 879 F.2d 880, 884-85 (D.C.\nCir. 1989), who were enrolled or employed in segregated\nschools, and the state legislator in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S.\n783, 786 n.4 (1983), who objected “as a member of the\nLegislature” to the use of a state-employed chaplain to convene\nits sessions. As members of a statutorily-defined community\nwithin the armed forces, appellants are not mere bystanders,\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 756 (1984), and they did not\n“roam the country,” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United\nfor Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 487 (1982),\nin search of impermissible government action.6\n\n\n        6\n            Contrary to the court’s suggestion, Op. at 12-13, Valley\nForge included no indication that the Supreme Court questioned the\nplaintiffs’ standing on the ground that a government land transfer to\na religious institution could not send a message of government\nendorsement of religion and thus violate the Establishment Clause.\nThe Court based its Article III holding on the fact that the plaintiffs\ndid not live in the state where the land transfer had occurred, had\nlearned about it indirectly through a press release, and indicated no\nconnection with the transfer that could personalize their stake in the\nsuit. See 454 U.S. at 486-87; see also ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490\nU.S. 605, 616 (1989). As our sister circuits have held, Valley Forge’s\nholding, 454 U.S. at 485-87, suggests that “[t]he neighbors in Valley\nForge,” Op. at 13, may be the very plaintiffs who would have had\nstanding there. See, e.g., Suhre, 131 F.3d at 1087; Washegesic, 33\n\f                                7\n\n      The uniqueness of appellants’ injury as chaplains in relation\nto their service in the Navy Chaplain Corps eliminates the\nconcern expressed in Valley Forge that recognizing their\nstanding would, in this court’s words, inappropriately “wedge\nopen the courthouse doors,” Op. at 14; see also id. at 10, 13.\nAppellants’ charge is based on an injury distinct to their status\nwithin the Chaplain Corps, see Schempp, 374 U.S. at 224 n.9;\nChaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 302; see also WEAL, 879 F.2d at 884-\n85, and, “like Schempp before it, Valley Forge recognized that\ndirect contact with an unwelcome religious exercise or display\nworks a personal injury distinct from and in addition to each\ncitizen’s general grievance against unconstitutional government\nconduct,” Suhre, 131 F.3d at 1086. Their alleged “genuine\nfeeling of exclusion from the community . . . , and the deep\noffense from a perceived insult to one’s religious view\ncommitted by the government in one’s community,” Ariz. Civ.\nLiberties Union v. Dunham, 112 F. Supp. 2d 927, 935 (D. Ariz.\n2000); see Suhre, 131 F.3d at 1087; Saladin, 812 F.2d at 692-93,\ndemonstrates that appellants have suffered a personal injury-in-\nfact.\n\n     To reach the opposite conclusion, the court ignores both the\nnature of appellants’ charge and binding precedent. First, the\ncourt describes the charge as if it concerns only religious\ndiscrimination in traditional monetary terms, such as retirement\nbenefits not denied to appellants or “discrimination suffered by\nothers.” See Op. at 2, 3, 6, 14. Yet appellants do not so delimit\ntheir charge; rather, they allege that the Navy’s 4109 program\nviolates the Establishment Clause by creating a government\n\n\n\n\nF.3d at 682-83; ACLU of Ga. v. Rabun County Chamber of\nCommerce, Inc., 698 F.2d 1098, 1106-07 (11th Cir. 1983).\n\f                                   8\n\nreligious preference, see Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 302.7\nAppellants’ standing thus does not hinge upon the mistreatment\nof any individual chaplain but upon the Navy’s alleged\nendorsement of a preference for another religious faith that\ndirectly affects them. The court’s narrow focus ignores the\nConstitution’s requirement that, in assessing constitutional\ninjury, “we keep in mind ‘the myriad, subtle ways in which\nEstablishment Clause values can be eroded,’” and that in\naddition to the mistreatment of an individual, “we [must] guard\nagainst other different, yet equally important, constitutional\ninjuries,” such as the unconstitutional implementation of a\ngovernment policy. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S.\n290, 314 (2000) (quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 694 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring)).\n\n     Second, the court states that “mere personal offense” or\nemotional injury is never enough for Article III injury, Op. at 11,\nbut that is not the law.8 As the Supreme Court acknowledged in\nAssociation of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v.\n\n\n        7\n            Although the court suggests that appellants have waived\naspects of their allegations, Op. at 6, 13, the record is clear that they\nhave not abandoned their Establishment Clause charge of an\nunconstitutional endorsement of a religious denomination that is\nparticularized to them personally. Oral Arg. Tr. at 8-10; 25. Counsel\nemphasized that it is appellants’ “direct contact [with the 4109\nprogram and its message] because of the small community” that\ncreates their injury, id. at 8, for due to their direct exposure as\nchaplains, they experience the 4109 program as a type of faith\ndiscrimination, “a religious gerrymander,” because “[i]t draws lines”\nto favor one religious faith over another. Id. at 10; see also\nAppellants’ Br. at 27.\n\n        8\n          See, e.g., Am. Soc’y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v.\nRingling Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Circus, 317 F.3d 334, 337-38\n(D.C.

Later, in Allen, 468 U.S. at 755, while holding\nthat a plaintiff alleging an equal protection violation generally\nmust claim a personal denial of equal treatment, the Supreme\nCourt observed that “[t]here can be no doubt that . . .\nnoneconomic injury [such as stigmatizing injury] is one of the\nmost serious consequences of discriminatory government action\nand is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.”9\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has reached the merits in numerous\nEstablishment Clause cases where “mere personal offense,” Op.\nat 11, resulting from a plaintiff’s connection to a challenged\npractice appears to have provided the main possible injury to\nground standing.10 As the Fourth Circuit has observed:\n\n             [T]he Establishment Clause plaintiff is not likely to\n\n\n        9\n            See, e.g., WEAL, 879 F.2d at 884-85; Gray v.

Establishment Clause precedent is not so conveniently\ncabined into the narrow circumstances described by the court,\nwhere the government itself “engag[ed] in religious speech,” id.\nFor one thing, the government need not intentionally favor one\nreligious denomination over another in order to violate the\nEstablishment Clause if its action has such an effect.11 When\nconsidering whether a government action has the effect of\nconveying a denominational endorsement, “[t]he question of\ngovernmental neutrality is not concluded by the observation that\n[a policy] on its face makes no discrimination between\nreligions.” Gillette v.

Rather, “the Establishment Clause forbids subtle\ndepartures from neutrality, ‘religious gerrymanders,’ as well as\nobvious abuses.” Gillette, 401 U.S. at 452 (quoting Walz v. Tax\nComm’n, 397 U.S. 664, 696 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)).\nAnd, “the most basic command of the Establishment Clause —\nnot to prefer some religions (and thereby some approaches to\nindoctrinating religion) to others” — does not apply only to a\ngovernment action such as a prayer or ceremony that explicitly\nadopts a denomination’s chosen religious symbols, but also to\nother action taken in the usual course of government regulation\nor operation. Univ. of Great Falls v. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335,\n1346 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228,\n244 (1982)); see, e.g., Mt. Royal Joint Venture, 477 F.3d at 758;\nLittlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., 268 F.3d 275, 294 (5th\nCir. 2001). Thus, government action that draws a line around a\nreligious denomination in a community can send a symbolic\nmessage of preference that needs no words just as easily as the\ngovernment’s direct presentation of a religious symbol. See,\ne.g., Kiryas Joel Vill., 512 U.S. at 697 (citing Larkin, 459 U.S.\nat 125-26).\n\n     The court ignores all of this precedent in adopting the novel\nconception that appellants are not harmed for purposes of\nstanding under the Establishment Clause unless the Navy itself\ndirectly uses religious words or symbols as occurred in the\nreligious display cases, Op. at 12, 14. Rather than distinguish\nprecedent in a reasoned manner, the court’s holding is the\nassertion that “[w]hen plaintiffs are not themselves affected by\na government action except through their abstract offense at the\nmessage allegedly conveyed by that action, they have not shown\ninjury-in-fact to bring an Establishment Clause claim, at least\noutside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer\ncases.” Id. at 14 (emphasis in original).             Yet, “[t]he\n\f                               12\n\nEstablishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government\nfrom appearing to take a position on questions of religious\nbelief or from ‘making adherence to a religion relevant in any\nway to a person’s standing in the . . . community,’” County of\nAllegheny, 492 U.S. at 594 (quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 687\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)) (emphasis added), and so directs the\ngovernment to avoid a practice that “may appear to the\nnonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the\nmachinery of the [government] to enforce a religious\northodoxy,” Lee, 505 U.S. at 592 (emphasis added). Moreover,\nwhen a court reaches the merits “[i]n cases involving\n[government] participation in a religious activity” — such as the\nemployment of Navy chaplains as religious ministry\nprofessionals — the question is “whether an objective observer\n. . . would perceive [its action] as a [governmental]\nendorsement” of religion. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., 530 U.S.\nat 308 (quotation marks omitted). Even so secular an act as the\ngrant of a copyright, this court held, ran aground because\nproviding exceptional copyright benefits to a particular religious\ninstitution “bestowed upon the Church . . . symbolic recognition\nas guardian of the [contested] text,” with consequent practical\nadvantages, and “ha[d] the unmistakable effect of advancing the\nChurch’s cause.” United Christian Scientists, 829 F.2d at 1171.\nAlthough the religious institution alone used religious words and\nsymbols, the government’s unusual treatment of one church\n“unequivocally and unqualifiedly endorsed [it] as first\ninterpreter and guardian of th[e] [copyrighted] work.” Id. at\n1170; see also Commack, 294 F.3d at 425.\n\n     Here, within the context of their chaplaincy assignments\nand in the absence of a legitimate explanation, the 4109 program\ncould fairly be understood as a religious endorsement because\nit has the effect of selecting particular “religious words and\nsymbols,” Op. at 12, to play an enhanced role within the Navy\nChaplain Corps by specially retaining only representatives of the\n\f                                 13\n\nCatholic faith for extended service in which they engage in\nreligious speech on behalf of that Corps. See Santa Fe Indep.\nSch. Dist., 530 U.S. at 307-09. The job of a 4109 chaplain, as\nfor all chaplains, requires representing a particular denomination\nas a “religious ministry professional,” an “individual endorsed\nto represent a religious organization and to conduct its religious\nobservances or ceremonies.” Instruction 1304.28, Guidance for\nthe Appointment of Chaplains for the Military Departments ¶¶\n6, E.2.1.9 (Dep’t of Def. June 11, 2004); see England, 375 F.3d\nat 1171.12 So understood, due to appellants’ direct exposure to\nthe 4109 program’s preference for Catholics, the Navy conveys\nto them the “message . . . that [as nonadherents of the favored\ndenomination] they are outsiders, not full members of the . . .\ncommunity,” McCreary County, 545 U.S. at 860 (quotation\nmarks omitted), for “the government[] [appears to be] lending\nits support to the communication of a religious organization’s\nreligious message,” County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 601; see\nLarkin, 459 U.S. at 125-26; Commack, 294 F.3d at 425; United\nChristian Scientists, 829 F.2d at 1170-71, and thus causes them\npsychological harm as Navy chaplains that is cognizable under\nthe Establishment Clause.\n\n     In any event, whether the Navy’s 4109 program sends a\nprohibited message is a merits question that is not before the\ncourt, see Info. Handling Servs., Inc. v. Def. Automated Printing\nServs., 338 F.3d 1024, 1029 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Of course, the\ncourt’s premature determination of this issue may arise from the\nrealization that if a personally observed religious message\ncauses harm “there would be traditional standing,” as the Navy’s\ncounsel acknowledged, Oral Arg. Tr. at 13; see also id. at 18-22.\n\n\n        12\n           See also Instruction 1730.7B, Religious Ministry Support\nwithin the Department of the Navy ¶ 4.a (Dep’t of Navy, Ofc. of Sec’y\nOct. 12, 2000); Instruction 1730.1D, Religious Ministry in the Navy\n¶ 4 (Dep’t of Navy, Ofc. of Ch. of Naval Operations May 6, 2003).\n\f                                14\n\nAt this point in the proceedings in determining Article III\nstanding, however, the court must assume the merits of\nappellants’ charge that the Navy’s 4109 program “d[oes], in\nfact, convey” a message of denominational preference directly\nharming them as chaplains. Vasquez, 487 F.3d at 1251; see\nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500, 502; Info. Handling Servs., 338 F.3d at\n1029; City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir.\n2003).\n\n     Under the Establishment Clause, then, appellants’\nmembership in a narrowly defined community — the Navy\nChaplain Corps — directly affected by the 4109 program, and\nthe message this program communicates to them as chaplains\nparticularizes their injury-in-fact, for “[t]he practices of [one’s]\nown community may create a larger psychological wound than\nsomeplace [one is] just passing through,” Washegesic, 33 F.3d\nat 683, by making one feel like a “second class citizen[],”\nSaladin, 812 F.2d at 693; see Suhre, 131 F.3d at 1090. This\ndirectly follows from Chaplaincy and Supreme Court precedent,\nboth of which the court misconstrues. Because appellants’\ninjury-in-fact is traceable to the Navy’s 4109 program and is\nlikely to be redressed by holding that the program is unlawful\nand enjoining preferential treatment of 4109 chaplains and the\nmessage it sends to appellants, they also meet the other prongs\nof the standing test, see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.\n\n     Accordingly, I would reverse the denial of the motion for a\npreliminary injunction and leave for the district court to\ndetermine upon remand whether appellants have otherwise met\nthe requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction, see\nChaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 305, and respectfully dissent. Because\nappellants have Article III standing, I do not reach the question\nwhether they also have taxpayer standing.\n\f",

But the plaintiffs do not claim that the Navy actually discriminated against any of them. We conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to bring this claim, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The U.S. Navy maintains a Chaplain Corps of commissioned Navy officers to meet the spiritual needs of those who serve in the Navy and their families. Like other officers, chaplains are subject to military regulations with respect to hiring, promotion, and retirement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*759</span> The Navy divides its chaplains into four categoriesCatholic, liturgical Protestant, non-liturgical Protestant, and Special Worship. As we explained in a previous opinion in this litigation, \"liturgical Protestant\" includes Protestant denominations that follow an established liturgy in worship services and practice infant baptism, such as Lutheran, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational. <i>Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England,</i> 454 F.3d 290, 294 (D.C.Cir.2006) (<i>Chaplaincy</i>). \"Non-liturgical Protestant\" includes Protestant denominations that do not follow a formal liturgy in worship services and that baptize at the age of reason, such as Baptist, Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Charismatic. <i>Id.</i> at 294. The \"Special Worship\" category refers to other religious faiths, both Christian and non-Christian, and it includes Jewish, Christian Science, Seventh-Day Adventist, Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Jehovah's Witness, and Unitarian. <i>Id.</i> at 295 n. 3.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are non-liturgical Protestant Navy chaplains, both current and retired.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the Navy discriminates in favor of Catholic chaplains in certain aspects of its retirement system. <i>See </i><i>In re Navy Chaplaincy,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d 119, 121 (D.D.C.2007). Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>The District Court initially denied plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion, finding that the chaplains had not shown the necessary irreparable injury to support a preliminary injunction. <i>See Adair v. England,</i> Nos. 00-cv-566 &amp; 99-cv-2945, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2005). On appeal, this Court reversed, explaining that, for purposes of a preliminary injunction, the allegation of an Establishment Clause violation itself demonstrates sufficient harm to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction testassuming, of course, that the party has standing to allege the violation in the first place. <i>See </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 303-04 &amp; n. 8. The Court therefore vacated the denial of a preliminary injunction and remanded for the District Court to consider the remaining factors in the preliminary injunction analysis, including likelihood of success on the merits. <i>See id.</i> at 304-05.</p>\n<p>On remand, in a well-reasoned opinion, the District Court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this claim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power to deciding \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" \"One of the controlling elements in the definition of a case or controversy under Article III is standing.\" <i>Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2553, 2562, 168 L.Ed.2d 424 (2007) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).<sup>[2]</sup> The three factors establishing the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" of standing are well established. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). First and most relevant here is injury-in-fact: A would-be plaintiff must have suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is (i) \"concrete and particularized\" rather than abstract or generalized, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*760</span> and (ii) \"actual or imminent\" rather than remote, speculative, conjectural or hypothetical. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin.,</i> 489 F.3d 1279, 1292-93 (D.C.Cir.2007). Second is causation: The asserted injury must be \"fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Third is redressability: It must be likely that a favorable decision by the court would redress the plaintiff's injury. <i>Id.</i> at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic ideathe idea of separation of powers.\" <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). The doctrine is \"founded in concern about the proper and properly limitedrole of the courts in a democratic society.\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The federal courts are \"not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be repugnant to the Constitution.\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2562. \"Vindicating the <i>public</i> interest (including the public interest in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 576, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <i>see also </i><i>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 474-75, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p>Those critical and bedrock principles of separation of powers inform our approach to plaintiffs' claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In reviewing the standing question, we must be \"careful not to decide the questions on the merits for or against the plaintiff, and must therefore assume that on the merits the plaintiffs would be successful in their claims.\" <i>City of Waukesha v. EPA,</i> 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C.Cir.2003). For purposes of our analysis in this case, we therefore must assume arguendo that the Navy's operation of its retirement system favors Catholic chaplains and disfavors non-liturgical Protestant chaplains in violation of the \"clearest command of the Establishment Clause\"that \"one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\" <i>Larson v. Valente,</i> 456 U.S. 228, 244, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982). Even assuming that plaintiffs' allegations are accurate, however, they do not have standing to bring this claim against the Navy because they have not sufficiently demonstrated their own injury-in-fact.</p>\n<p>If plaintiffs had alleged that the Navy discriminated against them on account of their religion, plaintiffs would have alleged a concrete and particularized harm sufficient to constitute injury-in-fact for standing purposes. But plaintiffs have conceded that they themselves did not suffer employment discrimination on account of their religion. They have conceded that the Navy did not deny them any benefits or opportunities on account of their religion. <i>See </i><i>In re Navy Chaplaincy,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d 119, 124-26 (D.D.C.2007). Rather, they suggest that <i>other</i> chaplains suffered such discrimination.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that they nonetheless have standing for either of two reasons: (i) they are taxpayers who object to the Navy's allegedly discriminatory operation of its chaplaincy program, or (ii) they have been subjected to the Navy's \"message\" of religious preference as a result of the Navy's running a retirement system that favors Catholic chaplains. We disagree. Because plaintiffs' claim does not fit within the narrow confines of Establishment Clause taxpayer standing permitted by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*761</span> <i>Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), they do not have standing as taxpayers. <i>See </i><i>Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2553, 2562-72, 168 L.Ed.2d 424 (2007). Nor do plaintiffs have standing based on their exposure to the Navy's alleged \"message\" of religious preference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, a taxpayer's interest in ensuring that appropriated funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution does not suffice to confer Article III standing. <i>See </i><i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2563 (2007). Back in <i>Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), taxpayers sued the Government, arguing that the Maternity Act of 1921 improperly invaded powers reserved to States by the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected taxpayer standing in that case: \"The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern. If one taxpayer may champion and litigate such a cause, then every other taxpayer may do the same....\" <i>Id.</i> at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597; <i>see also </i><i>Doremus v. Bd. of Educ. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U.S. 429, 433-34, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).</p>\n<p>In 1968, 45 years after <i>Frothingham,</i> the Supreme Court carved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional bar on taxpayer suits; the Court held that federal taxpayers had standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge to federal financing for parochial schools. <i>See </i><i>Flast,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942. But according to <i>Flast,</i> taxpayers may bring an Establishment Clause challenge only when they challenge legislation passed pursuant to the Taxing and Spending Clause in Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. <i>See id.</i> at 102-03, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p>The Court has subsequently made clear that <i>Flast</i> is a very narrow exception to the general bar against taxpayer standing. In <i>Valley Forge,</i> for example, the plaintiffs argued that the Government violated the Establishment Clause when it transferred a tract of \"surplus property\" to a Christian college. <i>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 467-68, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court found that the plaintiffs, a group composed of \"90,000 taxpayer members,\" did not have standing both because the challenged action was executive rather than legislative and because the property transfer was an exercise of executive authority pursuant to legislation passed under the Property Clause in Article IV, § 3 of the Constitution rather than the Taxing and Spending Clause in Article I, § 8. <i>Id.</i> at 469, 479-80, 102 S.Ct. 752 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> the Supreme Court allowed a group of federal taxpayers to challenge the Adolescent Family Life Act, a statute appropriating funds for religious organizations, among others, to fight teen pregnancy. 487 U.S. 589, 593, 596-97, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). The Court found that plaintiffs' claim challenged a program expressly authorized by Congress under the taxing and spending power, thus fitting within <i>Flast. Id.</i> at 619, 108 S.Ct. 2562. The key to <i>Bowen</i>'s conclusion, as the Court has subsequently explained, was that the statute was \"`at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers'\" and that plaintiffs' claims were concerned with the expenditure of funds \"`pursuant to the AFLA's statutory mandate.'\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2567 (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*762</span> <i>Bowen,</i> 487 U.S. at 619-20, 108 S.Ct. 2562) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>In its recent decision in <i>Hein,</i> the Court declined to expand <i>Flast</i> to encompass discretionary Executive Branch spending: \"Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the <i>Flast</i> exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal actionbe it a conference, proclamation or speechto Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2569. Although <i>Hein</i> did not eliminate the <i>Flast</i> exception to the bar against taxpayer standing, the case forcefully emphasized the exception's extremely limited contours: \"It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the <i>Flast</i> exception has largely been confined to its facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2568-69. As <i>Hein</i> explained, the Court has limited the \"expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the results in <i>Flast.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 2569 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiffs' claim does not fit within the narrow <i>Flast</i> exception. No legislative enactment expressly authorizes or appropriates funds for the Navy to favor Catholic chaplains in its retirement system. Plaintiffs cite, for example, the statutes establishing the Navy Chaplain Corps, but those statutes make no reference to denominational category, only to chaplains generally. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 5142, 5150. And plaintiffs, who themselves are chaplains, obviously do not contend that congressional legislation establishing the Navy Chaplaincy itself violates the Establishment Clause; they merely want the Navy to operate the Chaplain Corps differently. <i>Cf. </i><i>Katcoff v. Marsh,</i> 755 F.2d 223 (2d Cir.1985) (approving military chaplaincy program).</p>\n<p>As in <i>Hein,</i> the challenged expenditures hereextra salary and retirement-related benefits allegedly provided to Catholic chaplains\"were not expressly authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment.\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2568. Indeed, plaintiffs contend that the Chaplain Corps is being operated by the Navy in contravention of the law, not in accordance with the law. <i>See</i> Plaintiffs' Br. 48 (\"Appellees have not followed either the law or the DOD regulations.\"). Under the Supreme Court's precedents, that contention directly undermines any claim to taxpayer standing. In sum, plaintiffs do not have standing as taxpayers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs alternatively contend that they have standing because \"Establishment Clause injury flows from the forbidden messages of preference or disapproval\" inherent in the Navy's denominational preference. Plaintiffs' Br. 28. In so arguing, they rely primarily on this Court's decision in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> which explained that for the purposes of a preliminary injunction, the \"mere allegation\" of an Establishment Clause violation is always sufficient to show irreparable harm. <i>Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England,</i> 454 F.3d 290, 303-04 (D.C.Cir.2006). Plaintiffs claim that because their allegations demonstrate irreparable injury for preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*763</span> injunction purposes, they have necessarily shown injury-in-fact for standing purposes.</p>\n<p>But the Court in <i>Chaplaincy</i> merely held that the allegation of an Establishment Clause violation is sufficient to satisfy the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary injunction standard<i>presupposing that a party has standing to allege such a violation. See id.</i> at 303-04 &amp; n. 8. A per se rule defining automatic injury-in-fact for every plaintiff who claims an Establishment Clause violationas plaintiffs strain to find in the <i>Chaplaincy</i> opinionwould run counter to decades of settled jurisprudence setting forth the requirements for standing in Establishment Clause cases. Jurisdictional requirements are not disposed of so easily, and the Court in <i>Chaplaincy</i> did not purport to make the sweeping change attributed to it by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Apart from citing <i>Chaplaincy,</i> plaintiffs also claim injury-in-fact from their being subjected to the \"message\" of religious preference conveyed by the Navy's allegedly preferential retirement program for Catholic chaplains. The program, they say, makes them feel like second-class citizens within the Navy Chaplaincy even if they themselves have not suffered discrimination on account of their religion.</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has often stated, mere personal offense to government action does not give rise to standing to sue. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 752-54, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984); <i>see also </i><i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 575-76, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). \"By the mere bringing of his suit, <i>every</i> plaintiff demonstrates his belief that a favorable judgment will make him happier. But although a suitor may derive great comfort and joy\" from knowing that the Government is following constitutional imperatives, \"that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable Article III remedy because it does not redress a cognizable Article III injury.\" <i>Steel Co. v.

It is a well-established rule that \"cases in which jurisdiction is assumed <i>sub silentio</i> are not binding authority for the proposition that jurisdiction exists.\" <i>John Doe, Inc. v. DEA,</i> 484 F.3d 561, 569 n. 5 (D.C.Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, accepting those cases as precedents on standing,<sup>[4]</sup> we nonetheless find significant differences between plaintiffs' case and the religious display and prayer cases. In the religious display and prayer cases, the Government was actively and directly communicating a religious message through religious words or religious symbolsin other words, it was engaging in religious speech that was observed, read, or heard by the plaintiffs in those cases. Here, by contrast, the Navy is not communicating a religious message through religious words or religious symbols. Plaintiffs' objection here is more akin to the objection to the property transfer in <i>Valley Forge,</i> where the Court stated that the plaintiffs failed \"to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by <i>observation of conduct</i> with which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms.\" <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S. at 485-86, 102 S.Ct. 752 (emphasis added and omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1086 (quoting <i>Valley Forge</i> and stating \"a mere abstract objection to unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient to confer standing\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' argument would extend the religious display and prayer cases in a significant and unprecedented manner and eviscerate well-settled standing limitations. Under plaintiffs' theory, every government <i>action</i> that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause could be re-characterized as a governmental <i>message</i> promoting religion. And therefore everyone who becomes aware of the \"message\" would have standing to sue. The neighbors in <i>Valley Forge,</i> the hotel workers at a conference for faith-based organizations in <i>Hein,</i> the list goes onall could have obtained standing to sue simply by targeting not the government's action, but rather the government's alleged \"message\" of religious preference communicated through that action. Indeed, as plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged at oral argument, under plaintiffs' standing theory any recipient of the Navy's \"message\" in this case, including the judges on this panel, would have standing to bring suit challenging the allegedly discriminatory Chaplain Corps. Oral Arg. Tr. at 6-7. The jurisdictional requirements of Article III are not so manipulable. They do not allow anyone who becomes aware of a government action that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause to sue over it on the ground that they are offended by the allegedly unconstitutional \"message\" communicated by that action. In the government employment context at issue here, it thus comes as no surprise that neither plaintiffs nor the dissent has cited any case holding that a plaintiff can maintain a religious employment discrimination suit under the Religion Clauses when complaining about employment discrimination suffered by others, not by the plaintiff himself or herself. We think the reason for the dearth of precedent is evident: When plaintiffs are not themselves affected by a government <i>action</i> except through their abstract offense at the <i>message</i> allegedly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*765</span> conveyed by that action, they have not shown injury-in-fact to bring an Establishment Clause claim, at least outside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.</p>\n<p>To be sure, we recognize that plaintiffs' creative analogy to the religious display and prayer cases has some surface logic. But the implications of plaintiffs' theory for standing doctrine are quite radical: Plaintiffs seek to use the religious display and prayer cases to wedge open the courthouse doors to a wide range of plaintiffs alleging Establishment Clause violations who were previously barred by bedrock standing requirementsrequirements that are essential to preserving the separation of powers and limited judicial role mandated by the Constitution. We decline the invitation to transform Establishment Clause standing doctrine in this way. What the Supreme Court said last year in <i>Hein</i> applies just as well to plaintiffs' reliance on the religious display and prayer cases here: \"It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2571.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>ROGERS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p>The Establishment Clause prevents \"the Government's placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services,\" <i>Engel v. Vitale,</i> 370 U.S. 421, 429, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962), and ensures that \"all creeds ... be tolerated and none favored,\" <i>Lee v.

Liberties Union of Ky.,</i> 545 U.S. 844, 860, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005). A governmental accommodation for religion may violate the Establishment Clause if it \"singles out a particular religious sect for special treatment\" because \"whatever the limits of permissible ... accommodations may be..., it is clear that neutrality as among religions must be honored.\" <i>Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill. Sch. Dist. v.

England,</i> 454 F.3d 290 (D.C.Cir.2006), the court thus observed that the liberty interest shielded by the Establishment Clause is \"protection against government imposition of a state religion <i>or religious preference,</i>\" <i>id.</i> at 302 (emphasis added). Stating that \"the Establishment Clause is implicated as soon as the government engages in impermissible action,\" <i>id.,</i> the court explained that unlike freedom of expression cases, for example, \"[t]he harm inflicted by religious establishment is self-executing and requires no attendant conduct on the part of the individual,\" <i>id.</i> at 303; <i>see also id.</i> at 302. In describing the impermissible government action at issue, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Where, as here, the charge is one of official preference of one religion over another, such governmental endorsement \"sends a message to nonadherents [of the favored denomination] that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*766</span> <i>Id.</i> at 302 (quoting <i>Lynch v.

The court held that such an allegation sufficed to show irreparable harm, or \"injury [that is] beyond remediation [by monetary damages],\" <i>id.</i> at 297, for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief, crediting appellants' allegation of \"the harm that flows from the `forbidden message' of marginalization [that the Navy's] actions send to [them],\" <i>id.</i> at 299 (quoting Appellants' Br. at 20). The court did not expressly hold that appellants<sup>[1]</sup> had Article III standing, but <i>see </i><i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), but noted that its legal \"conclusion presupposes, of course, that the party has standing to allege such a violation,\" <i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 304 n. 8.</p>\n<p>The court's decision in <i>Chaplaincy</i> regarding appellants' liberty interest that is protected by the Establishment Clause and the nature of their injury is no less applicable here. The same parties and the same charge are involved, <i>see </i><i>LaShawn A. v. Barry,</i> 87 F.3d 1389, 1393-95 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (en banc), and injury sufficient for irreparable harm has resonance for injury-in-fact under Article III, <i>see </i><i>Taylor v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 56 F.3d 1497, 1508 (D.C.Cir.1995), because to show irreparable harm \"[a] plaintiff must do more than merely allege ... harm sufficient to establish standing,\" <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equity,</i> 950 F.2d 1401, 1410 (9th Cir.1991). As explained in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> \"[t]his court has set a high standard for irreparable injury\" within the preliminary injunction inquiry. 454 F.3d at 297. Such injury must be \"both certain and great,\" \"actual and not theoretical,\" \"beyond remediation,\" and also \"of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citations omitted). For Article III, the requisite injury-in-fact must be \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent,\" not \"hypothetical.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (quotation marks omitted). Because \"the Navy's alleged violation of the Establishment Clause per se constitutes irreparable harm,\" <i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 299, appellants have met their burden on the injury prong of Article III standing.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>As members of non-liturgical Protestant churches and fellowships, appellants assert that the Navy has singled out the Catholic faith as the preferred religious tradition in its Chaplain Corps by choosing over several decades to allow only Catholic chaplains to serve beyond the required separation dates.<sup>[3]</sup> This sends a message of denominational <span class=\"star-pagination\">*767</span> preference for Catholics and marginalization for non-Catholic adherents, causing appellants to suffer psychological harm while serving as chaplains. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 37(e), 39. By endowing Naval officer status in a preferential manner upon the representatives of a particular type of religious ministry,<sup>[4]</sup> who then, as part of their Naval service duties, use words and symbols to serve their religious cause, the Navy allegedly has \"take[n] sides in a religious matter, effectively discriminating in favor of [one religion's] view,\" <i>Commack Self-Serv. Kosher Meats, Inc. v. Weiss,</i> 294 F.3d 415, 425 (2d Cir.2002), of the type of religious ministry that is most appropriate to serve \"the religious needs of sailors,\" <i>In re England,</i> 375 F.3d 1169, 1171 (D.C.Cir. 2004). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McCreary County,</i> 545 U.S. at 860, 125 S.Ct. 2722; <i>Kiryas Joel Vill.,</i> 512 U.S. at 698-705, 114 S.Ct. 2481.</p>\n<p>Appellants have suffered particularized Article III injury because they are not strangers to the Navy's 4109 program. Their membership within the Chaplain Corps and their resulting receipt of a message of denominational preference make them comparable to a citizen who has \"personal contact with the alleged establishment of religion,\" <i>Suhre v. Haywood County,</i> 131 F.3d 1083, 1086 (4th Cir. 1997), such as in the religious display cases.<sup>[5]</sup> Appellants' charge does more than present a \"creative analogy\" with \"some surface logic,\" Op. at 765, as the court offers no basis for its unsupported conclusion that this case is different from \"the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases,\" <i>id.</i> As counsel for the Navy acknowledged, \"if a chaplain ... is personally exposed to a [message of religious preference], there would be traditional standing.\" Oral Arg. Tr. at 13 (Apr. 24, 2008). That is what appellants allege in charging that the 4109 program establishes an \"official preference of one religion over another\" that causes them psychological injury due to their personal and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*768</span> direct receipt of the \"`message ... that they are outsiders, not full members'\" of the Navy's Chaplain Corps. <i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 302 (quoting <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). Appellants' injury is thus as particularized, <i>see </i><i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561 n. 1, 573-74, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), as that of the children in <i>Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. at 223-24, 83 S.Ct. 1560, to whom school prayers were read, the plaintiffs in <i>Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) v. Cavazos,</i> 879 F.2d 880, 884-85 (D.C.Cir.1989), who were enrolled or employed in segregated schools, and the state legislator in <i>Marsh v. Chambers,</i> 463 U.S. 783, 786 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), who objected \"as a member of the Legislature\" to the use of a state-employed chaplain to convene its sessions. As members of a statutorily-defined community within the armed forces, appellants are not mere bystanders, <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 756, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984), and they did not \"roam the country,\" <i>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church and State,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 487, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), in search of impermissible government action.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The uniqueness of appellants' injury as chaplains in relation to their service in the Navy Chaplain Corps eliminates the concern expressed in <i>Valley Forge</i> that recognizing their standing would, in this court's words, inappropriately \"wedge open the courthouse doors,\" Op. at 765; <i>see also id.</i> at 762, 764. Appellants' charge is based on an injury distinct to their status within the Chaplain Corps, <i>see </i><i>Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. at 224 n. 9, 83 S.Ct. 1560; <i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 302; <i>see also WEAL,</i> 879 F.2d at 884-85, and, \"like <i>Schempp</i> before it, <i>Valley Forge</i> recognized that direct contact with an unwelcome religious exercise or display works a personal injury distinct from and in addition to each citizen's general grievance against unconstitutional government conduct,\" <i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1086. Their alleged \"genuine feeling of exclusion from the community ..., and the deep offense from a perceived insult to one's religious view committed by the government in one's community,\" <i>Ariz. Civ. Liberties Union v. Dunham,</i> 112 F.Supp.2d 927, 935 (D.Ariz.2000); <i>see </i><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1087; <i>Saladin,</i> 812 F.2d at 692-93, demonstrates that appellants have suffered a personal injury-in-fact.</p>\n<p>To reach the opposite conclusion, the court ignores both the nature of appellants' charge and binding precedent. First, the court describes the charge as if it concerns only religious discrimination in traditional monetary terms, such as retirement benefits not denied to appellants or \"discrimination suffered by others.\" <i>See</i> Op. at 758-59, 759, 760-61, 764. Yet appellants do not so delimit their charge; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*769</span> rather, they allege that the Navy's 4109 program violates the Establishment Clause by creating a government religious preference, <i>see </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 302.<sup>[7]</sup> Appellants' standing thus does not hinge upon the mistreatment of any individual chaplain but upon the Navy's alleged endorsement of a preference for another religious faith that directly affects them. The court's narrow focus ignores the Constitution's requirement that, in assessing constitutional injury, \"we keep in mind `the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can be eroded,'\" and that in addition to the mistreatment of an individual, \"we [must] guard against other different, yet equally important, constitutional injuries,\" such as the unconstitutional implementation of a government policy. <i>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe,</i> 530 U.S. 290, 314, 120 S.Ct. 2266, 147 L.Ed.2d 295 (2000) (quoting <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>Second, the court states that \"mere personal offense\" or emotional injury is never enough for Article III injury, Op. at 763, but that is not the law.<sup>[8]</sup> As the Supreme Court acknowledged in <i>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp,</i> 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), \"[a] person ... may have a spiritual stake in First Amendment values sufficient to give standing to raise issues concerning the Establishment Clause\" if directly affected by the challenged governmental practice, <i>id.</i> at 154, 90 S.Ct. 827 (citing <i>Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844); <i>see </i><i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S. at 486-87 &amp; n. 22, 102 S.Ct. 752. Later, in <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S. at 755, 104 S.Ct. 3315, while holding that a plaintiff alleging an equal protection violation generally must claim a personal denial of equal treatment, the Supreme Court observed that \"[t]here can be no doubt that... noneconomic injury [such as stigmatizing injury] is one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory government action and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.\"<sup>[9]</sup> In fact, the Supreme Court has reached the merits in numerous Establishment Clause cases where \"mere personal offense,\" Op. at 761-62, resulting from a plaintiff's connection to a challenged practice appears to have provided the main possible injury to ground standing.<sup>[10]</sup> As the Fourth Circuit has observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*770</span> [T]he Establishment Clause plaintiff is not likely to suffer physical injury or pecuniary loss. Rather the spiritual, value-laden beliefs of the plaintiffs are often most directly affected by an alleged establishment of religion. Accordingly, rules of standing recognize that noneconomic or intangible injury may suffice to make an Establishment Clause claim justiciable.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1086 (quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>see supra</i> note 5.</p>\n<p>Equally problematic is the court's attempt to contrast appellants' case with those where the government has, in the court's words, \"actively and directly communicat[ed] a religious message through religious words or religious symbols,\" Op. at 764. Establishment Clause precedent is not so conveniently cabined into the narrow circumstances described by the court, where the government itself \"engag[ed] in religious speech,\" <i>id.</i> For one thing, the government need not intentionally favor one religious denomination over another in order to violate the Establishment Clause if its action has such an effect.<sup>[11]</sup> When considering whether a government action has the effect of conveying a denominational endorsement, \"[t]he question of governmental neutrality is not concluded by the observation that [a policy] on its face makes no discrimination between religions.\" <i>Gillette v. United States,</i> 401 U.S. 437, 452, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971). Equally important, there also is no requirement that the government go so far as to use \"religious words or religious symbols,\" Op. at 764, to establish an unconstitutional religious endorsement. Rather, \"the Establishment Clause forbids subtle departures from neutrality, `religious gerrymanders,' as well as obvious abuses.\" <i>Gillette,</i> 401 U.S. at 452, 91 S.Ct. 828 (quoting <i>Walz v. Tax Comm'n,</i> 397 U.S. 664, 696, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). And, \"the most basic command of the Establishment Clausenot to prefer some religions (and thereby some approaches to indoctrinating religion) to others\"does not apply only to a government action such as a prayer or ceremony that explicitly adopts a denomination's chosen religious symbols, but also to other action taken in the usual course of government regulation or operation. <i>Univ. of Great Falls v. NLRB,</i> 278 F.3d 1335, 1346 (D.C.Cir.2002) (citing <i>Larson v. Valente,</i> 456 U.S. 228, 244, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982)); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Mt. Royal Joint Venture,</i> 477 F.3d at 748; <i>Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 268 F.3d 275, 294 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, government action that draws a line around a religious denomination in a community can send a symbolic message of preference that needs no words just as easily as the government's direct presentation of a religious symbol. <i>See, e.g., Kiryas Joel Vill.,</i> 512 U.S. at 697, 114 S.Ct. 2481 (citing <i>Larkin,</i> 459 U.S. at 125-26, 103 S.Ct. 505).</p>\n<p>The court ignores all of this precedent in adopting the novel conception that appellants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*771</span> are not harmed for purposes of standing under the Establishment Clause unless the Navy itself directly uses religious words or symbols as occurred in the religious display cases, Op. at 763, 764-65. Rather than distinguish precedent in a reasoned manner, the court's holding is the assertion that \"[w]hen plaintiffs are not themselves affected by a government <i>action</i> except through their abstract offense at the message allegedly conveyed by that action, they have not shown injury-in-fact to bring an Establishment Clause claim, at least outside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 764-65 (emphasis in original). Yet, \"[t]he Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from <i>appearing</i> to take a position on questions of religious belief or from `making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the ... community,'\" <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 594, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (quoting <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring)) (emphasis added), and so directs the government to avoid a practice that \"<i>may appear</i> to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the [government] to enforce a religious orthodoxy,\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 592, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (emphasis added). Moreover, when a court reaches the merits \"[i]n cases involving [government] participation in a religious activity\"such as the employment of Navy chaplains as religious ministry professionalsthe question is \"whether an objective observer ... would perceive [its action] as a [governmental] endorsement\" of religion. <i>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 530 U.S. at 308, 120 S.Ct. 2266 (quotation marks omitted). Even so secular an act as the grant of a copyright, this court held, ran aground because providing exceptional copyright benefits to a particular religious institution \"bestowed upon the Church ... symbolic recognition as guardian of the [contested] text,\" with consequent practical advantages, and \"ha[d] the unmistakable effect of advancing the Church's cause.\" <i>United Christian Scientists,</i> 829 F.2d at 1171. Although the religious institution alone used religious words and symbols, the government's unusual treatment of one church \"unequivocally and unqualifiedly endorsed [it] as first interpreter and guardian of th[e] [copyrighted] work.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1170; <i>see also </i><i>Commack,</i> 294 F.3d at 425.</p>\n<p>Here, within the context of their chaplaincy assignments and in the absence of a legitimate explanation, the 4109 program could fairly be understood as a religious endorsement because it has the effect of selecting particular \"religious words and symbols,\" Op. at 764, to play an enhanced role within the Navy Chaplain Corps by specially retaining only representatives of the Catholic faith for extended service in which they engage in religious speech on behalf of that Corps. <i>See </i><i>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 530 U.S. at 307-09, 120 S.Ct. 2266.

June 11, 2004); <i>see </i><i>England,</i> 375 F.3d at 1171.<sup>[12]</sup> So understood, due to appellants' direct exposure to the 4109 program's preference for Catholics, the Navy conveys to them the \"message ... that [as nonadherents of the favored denomination] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*772</span> they are outsiders, not full members of the ... community,\" <i>McCreary County,</i> 545 U.S. at 860, 125 S.Ct. 2722 (quotation marks omitted), for \"the government[] [appears to be] lending its support to the communication of a religious organization's religious message,\" <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 601, 109 S.Ct. 3086; <i>see </i><i>Larkin,</i> 459 U.S. at 125-26, 103 S.Ct. 505; <i>Commack,</i> 294 F.3d at 425; <i>United Christian Scientists,</i> 829 F.2d at 1170-71, and thus causes them psychological harm as Navy chaplains that is cognizable under the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>In any event, whether the Navy's 4109 program sends a prohibited message is a merits question that is not before the court, <i>see </i><i>Info. Handling Servs., Inc. v. Def. Automated Printing Servs.,</i> 338 F.3d 1024, 1029 (D.C.Cir.2003). Of course, the court's premature determination of this issue may arise from the realization that if a personally observed religious message causes harm \"there would be traditional standing,\" as the Navy's counsel acknowledged, Oral Arg. Tr. at 13; <i>see also id.</i> at 18-22. At this point in the proceedings in determining Article III standing, however, the court must assume the merits of appellants' charge that the Navy's 4109 program \"d[oes], in fact, convey\" a message of denominational preference directly harming them as chaplains. <i>Vasquez,</i> 487 F.3d at 1251; <i>see </i><i>Warth,</i> 422 U.S. at 500, 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197; <i>Info. Handling Servs.,</i> 338 F.3d at 1029; <i>City of Waukesha v. EPA,</i> 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Under the Establishment Clause, then, appellants' membership in a narrowly defined communitythe Navy Chaplain Corpsdirectly affected by the 4109 program, and the message this program communicates to them as chaplains particularizes their injury-in-fact, for \"[t]he practices of [one's] own community may create a larger psychological wound than someplace [one is] just passing through,\" <i>Washegesic,</i> 33 F.3d at 683, by making one feel like a \"second class citizen[],\" <i>Saladin,</i> 812 F.2d at 693; <i>see </i><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1090. This directly follows from <i>Chaplaincy</i> and Supreme Court precedent, both of which the court misconstrues. Because appellants' injury-in-fact is traceable to the Navy's 4109 program and is likely to be redressed by holding that the program is unlawful and enjoining preferential treatment of 4109 chaplains and the message it sends to appellants, they also meet the other prongs of the standing test, <i>see </i><i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I would reverse the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction and leave for the district court to determine upon remand whether appellants have otherwise met the requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction, <i>see </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 305, and respectfully dissent. Because appellants have Article III standing, I do not reach the question whether they also have taxpayer standing.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Plaintiffs also include certain organizations of non-liturgical Protestant chaplains. Because the organizations have standing in these circumstances only if one of their individual members has standing, we do not address them separately. <i>See </i><i>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> 432 U.S. 333, 342-43, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977).</p>\n<p>[2]  In referring to <i>Hein</i> throughout our opinion, we are referring specifically to Justice Alito's opinion, which is the binding opinion of the Court in that case. <i>See </i><i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977).</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Flast</i> exception may be further limited to Congress's disbursement of federal funds <i>outside the Government.</i> In both <i>Flast</i> and <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> the only two Supreme Court cases upholding taxpayer standing, the statutes authorized disbursement of federal funds to outside entities, including religious organizations. But we need not address that question in this case given that plaintiffs' argument for taxpayer standing fails at a more basic level.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>See generally </i><i>Doe v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch. Bd.,</i> 494 F.3d 494, 499-502 (5th Cir.2007) (DeMoss, J., concurring); Ira C. Lupu &amp; Robert W. Tuttle, <i>Ball on a Needle: Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation, Inc. and the Future of Establishment Clause Adjudication,</i> 2008 B.Y.U. L.REV. 115, 158-64 (2008).</p>\n<p>[1]  Due to the consolidation of three cases, appellants include active duty, reserve, retired, and former non-liturgical Protestant Navy chaplains as in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> and two endorsing agenciesChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches and Associated Gospel Churches. Hereinafter in referring to \"appellants,\" I refer only to the chaplains currently serving in the Navy Chaplain Corps.</p>\n<p>[2]  To the extent the court seeks to avoid this precedent by interpreting a footnote in <i>Chaplaincy</i> to indicate that the court was \"presupposing\" appellants' standing, Op. at 762-63, and thus addressing the request for injunctive relief without satisfying itself that appellants had standing, its approach is contrary both to the principle in <i>Steel Co.,</i> 523 U.S. at 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, and to the more natural reading of the footnote as merely recognizing, as this court has done before, that this prong of the preliminary injunction inquiry and the entirety of the Article III standing inquiry \"overlap[] ... somewhat,\" but are not coextensive, <i>see </i><i>Taylor,</i> 56 F.3d at 1508.</p>\n<p>[3]  According to appellants, \"the 4109 program\" has three parts: (1) illegal appointments to active duty through age waivers for over-age Catholic clergy, (2) the consequent illegal continuation of such clergy as chaplains to the age of 67, and (3) the eventual illegal transfer of such clergy to the Retired Reserve and subsequent recall to active duty as designated 4109 Reservists. The program is designed in part to allow Catholic chaplains who have reached their statutory separation age to continue to serve until they have completed twenty years of service and become eligible for pensions. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 1251, 14509, 14703; <i>see also </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 293-96. At the time appellants filed their complaints, the age limit for the appointment of chaplains, like other officers, was forty-two, <i>see</i> 10 U.S.C. § 532(a)(2); while this provision is no longer applicable to chaplains, <i>id.</i> at § 532(d)(1) (as amended by Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub.L. No. 108-375, 188 Stat. 1811, 1872 (Oct. 28, 2004)), the statutory separation age for chaplains and other officers remains in effect.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellants cite a list of Catholic chaplains coded as \"4109\" currently serving with them in the Navy Chaplain Corps, and assert that additional chaplains are destined to become 4109 chaplains in view of the Navy's list of Catholics appointed after age forty-two and extended on active duty and the dates they become eligible for pensions. For example, non-liturgical Protestant Chaplain Stewart served with over-age Catholic Chaplain Erestain. After this court's decision in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> it appears that the Navy extended two non-Catholic chaplains for service beyond the age of 62. <i>See</i> 454 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vasquez v. L.A. County,</i> 487 F.3d 1246, 1250-51 (9th Cir.2007); <i>Doe v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch. Bd.,</i> 473 F.3d 188, 196 (5th Cir.2006); <i>ACLU Neb. Found. v.

The Court based its Article III holding on the fact that the plaintiffs did not live in the state where the land transfer had occurred, had learned about it indirectly through a press release, and indicated no connection with the transfer that could personalize their stake in the suit. <i>See</i> 454 U.S. at 486-87, 102 S.Ct. 752; <i>see also </i><i>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,</i> 490 U.S. 605, 616, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). As our sister circuits have held, <i>Valley Forge</i>'s holding, 454 U.S. at 485-87, 102 S.Ct. 752, suggests that \"[t]he neighbors in <i>Valley Forge,</i>\" Op. at 764, may be the very plaintiffs who would have had standing there. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1087; <i>Washegesic,</i> 33 F.3d at 682-83; <i>ACLU of Ga. v. Rabun County Chamber of Commerce, Inc.,</i> 698 F.2d 1098, 1106-07 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p>[7]  Although the court suggests that appellants have waived aspects of their allegations, Op. at 763, 764, the record is clear that they have not abandoned their Establishment Clause charge of an unconstitutional endorsement of a religious denomination that is particularized to them personally. Oral Arg. Tr. at 8-10; 25. Counsel emphasized that it is appellants' \"direct contact [with the 4109 program and its message] because of the small community\" that creates their injury, <i>id.</i> at 761-62, for due to their direct exposure as chaplains, they experience the 4109 program as a type of faith discrimination, \"a religious gerrymander,\" because \"[i]t draws lines\" to favor one religious faith over another. <i>Id.</i> at 762-63; <i>see also</i> Appellants' Br. at 27.</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Am.

But the plaintiffs do not claim that the Navy actually discriminated against any of them. We conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to bring this claim, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The U.S. Navy maintains a Chaplain Corps of commissioned Navy officers to meet the spiritual needs of those who serve in the Navy and their families. Like other officers, chaplains are subject to military regulations with respect to hiring, promotion, and retirement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*759</span> The Navy divides its chaplains into four categoriesCatholic, liturgical Protestant, non-liturgical Protestant, and Special Worship. As we explained in a previous opinion in this litigation, \"liturgical Protestant\" includes Protestant denominations that follow an established liturgy in worship services and practice infant baptism, such as Lutheran, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational. <i>Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186744\"><a href=\"/opinion/186744/chaplaincy-full-v-england-gordon-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 294 (D.C.Cir.2006) (<i>Chaplaincy</i>). \"Non-liturgical Protestant\" includes Protestant denominations that do not follow a formal liturgy in worship services and that baptize at the age of reason, such as Baptist, Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Charismatic. <i>Id.</i> at 294. The \"Special Worship\" category refers to other religious faiths, both Christian and non-Christian, and it includes Jewish, Christian Science, Seventh-Day Adventist, Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Jehovah's Witness, and Unitarian. <i>Id.</i> at 295 n. 3.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are non-liturgical Protestant Navy chaplains, both current and retired.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the Navy discriminates in favor of Catholic chaplains in certain aspects of its retirement system. <i>See </i><i>In re Navy Chaplaincy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1578629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1578629/in-re-navy-chaplaincy/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 121 (D.D.C.2007). Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>The District Court initially denied plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion, finding that the chaplains had not shown the necessary irreparable injury to support a preliminary injunction. <i>See Adair v. England,</i> Nos. 00-cv-566 &amp; 99-cv-2945, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2005). On appeal, this Court reversed, explaining that, for purposes of a preliminary injunction, the allegation of an Establishment Clause violation itself demonstrates sufficient harm to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction testassuming, of course, that the party has standing to allege the violation in the first place. <i>See </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 303-04 &amp; n. 8. The Court therefore vacated the denial of a preliminary injunction and remanded for the District Court to consider the remaining factors in the preliminary injunction analysis, including likelihood of success on the merits. <i>See id.</i> at 304-05.</p>\n<p>On remand, in a well-reasoned opinion, the District Court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this claim.

The Court found that the plaintiffs, a group composed of \"90,000 taxpayer members,\" did not have standing both because the challenged action was executive rather than legislative and because the property transfer was an exercise of executive authority pursuant to legislation passed under the Property Clause in Article IV, § 3 of the Constitution rather than the Taxing and Spending Clause in Article I, § 8. <i>Id.</i> at 469, 479-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The key to <i>Bowen</i>'s conclusion, as the Court has subsequently explained, was that the statute was \"`at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress' taxing and spending powers'\" and that plaintiffs' claims were concerned with the expenditure of funds \"`pursuant to the AFLA's statutory mandate.'\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2567 (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*762</span> <i>Bowen,</i> 487 U.S. at 619-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although <i>Hein</i> did not eliminate the <i>Flast</i> exception to the bar against taxpayer standing, the case forcefully emphasized the exception's extremely limited contours: \"It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the <i>Flast</i> exception has largely been confined to its facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2568-69. As <i>Hein</i> explained, the Court has limited the \"expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the results in <i>Flast.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 2569 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiffs' claim does not fit within the narrow <i>Flast</i> exception. No legislative enactment expressly authorizes or appropriates funds for the Navy to favor Catholic chaplains in its retirement system. Plaintiffs cite, for example, the statutes establishing the Navy Chaplain Corps, but those statutes make no reference to denominational category, only to chaplains generally. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 5142, 5150. And plaintiffs, who themselves are chaplains, obviously do not contend that congressional legislation establishing the Navy Chaplaincy itself violates the Establishment Clause; they merely want the Navy to operate the Chaplain Corps differently. <i>Cf. </i><i>Katcoff v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448145\"><a href=\"/opinion/448145/joel-katcoff-and-allen-m-wieder-v-john-o-marsh-jr-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1985) (approving military chaplaincy program).</p>\n<p>As in <i>Hein,</i> the challenged expenditures hereextra salary and retirement-related benefits allegedly provided to Catholic chaplains\"were not expressly authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment.\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2568. Indeed, plaintiffs contend that the Chaplain Corps is being operated by the Navy in contravention of the law, not in accordance with the law. <i>See</i> Plaintiffs' Br. 48 (\"Appellees have not followed either the law or the DOD regulations.\"). Under the Supreme Court's precedents, that contention directly undermines any claim to taxpayer standing. In sum, plaintiffs do not have standing as taxpayers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs alternatively contend that they have standing because \"Establishment Clause injury flows from the forbidden messages of preference or disapproval\" inherent in the Navy's denominational preference. Plaintiffs' Br. 28. In so arguing, they rely primarily on this Court's decision in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> which explained that for the purposes of a preliminary injunction, the \"mere allegation\" of an Establishment Clause violation is always sufficient to show irreparable harm. <i>Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186744\"><a href=\"/opinion/186744/chaplaincy-full-v-england-gordon-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 303-04 (D.C.Cir.2006). Plaintiffs claim that because their allegations demonstrate irreparable injury for preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*763</span> injunction purposes, they have necessarily shown injury-in-fact for standing purposes.</p>\n<p>But the Court in <i>Chaplaincy</i> merely held that the allegation of an Establishment Clause violation is sufficient to satisfy the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary injunction standard<i>presupposing that a party has standing to allege such a violation. See id.</i> at 303-04 &amp; n. 8. A per se rule defining automatic injury-in-fact for every plaintiff who claims an Establishment Clause violationas plaintiffs strain to find in the <i>Chaplaincy</i> opinionwould run counter to decades of settled jurisprudence setting forth the requirements for standing in Establishment Clause cases. Jurisdictional requirements are not disposed of so easily, and the Court in <i>Chaplaincy</i> did not purport to make the sweeping change attributed to it by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Apart from citing <i>Chaplaincy,</i> plaintiffs also claim injury-in-fact from their being subjected to the \"message\" of religious preference conveyed by the Navy's allegedly preferential retirement program for Catholic chaplains. The program, they say, makes them feel like second-class citizens within the Navy Chaplaincy even if they themselves have not suffered discrimination on account of their religion.</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has often stated, mere personal offense to government action does not give rise to standing to sue. <i>Allen v.

In any event, accepting those cases as precedents on standing,<sup>[4]</sup> we nonetheless find significant differences between plaintiffs' case and the religious display and prayer cases. In the religious display and prayer cases, the Government was actively and directly communicating a religious message through religious words or religious symbolsin other words, it was engaging in religious speech that was observed, read, or heard by the plaintiffs in those cases. Here, by contrast, the Navy is not communicating a religious message through religious words or religious symbols. Plaintiffs' objection here is more akin to the objection to the property transfer in <i>Valley Forge,</i> where the Court stated that the plaintiffs failed \"to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by <i>observation of conduct</i> with which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms.\" <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S. at 485-86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span> (emphasis added and omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Suhre,</i> 131 F.3d at 1086 (quoting <i>Valley Forge</i> and stating \"a mere abstract objection to unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient to confer standing\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' argument would extend the religious display and prayer cases in a significant and unprecedented manner and eviscerate well-settled standing limitations. Under plaintiffs' theory, every government <i>action</i> that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause could be re-characterized as a governmental <i>message</i> promoting religion. And therefore everyone who becomes aware of the \"message\" would have standing to sue. The neighbors in <i>Valley Forge,</i> the hotel workers at a conference for faith-based organizations in <i>Hein,</i> the list goes onall could have obtained standing to sue simply by targeting not the government's action, but rather the government's alleged \"message\" of religious preference communicated through that action. Indeed, as plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged at oral argument, under plaintiffs' standing theory any recipient of the Navy's \"message\" in this case, including the judges on this panel, would have standing to bring suit challenging the allegedly discriminatory Chaplain Corps. Oral Arg. Tr. at 6-7. The jurisdictional requirements of Article III are not so manipulable. They do not allow anyone who becomes aware of a government action that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause to sue over it on the ground that they are offended by the allegedly unconstitutional \"message\" communicated by that action. In the government employment context at issue here, it thus comes as no surprise that neither plaintiffs nor the dissent has cited any case holding that a plaintiff can maintain a religious employment discrimination suit under the Religion Clauses when complaining about employment discrimination suffered by others, not by the plaintiff himself or herself. We think the reason for the dearth of precedent is evident: When plaintiffs are not themselves affected by a government <i>action</i> except through their abstract offense at the <i>message</i> allegedly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*765</span> conveyed by that action, they have not shown injury-in-fact to bring an Establishment Clause claim, at least outside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.</p>\n<p>To be sure, we recognize that plaintiffs' creative analogy to the religious display and prayer cases has some surface logic. But the implications of plaintiffs' theory for standing doctrine are quite radical: Plaintiffs seek to use the religious display and prayer cases to wedge open the courthouse doors to a wide range of plaintiffs alleging Establishment Clause violations who were previously barred by bedrock standing requirementsrequirements that are essential to preserving the separation of powers and limited judicial role mandated by the Constitution. We decline the invitation to transform Establishment Clause standing doctrine in this way. What the Supreme Court said last year in <i>Hein</i> applies just as well to plaintiffs' reliance on the religious display and prayer cases here: \"It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.\" <i>Hein,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2571.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>ROGERS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p>The Establishment Clause prevents \"the Government's placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services,\" <i>Engel v.

Because appellants' injury-in-fact is traceable to the Navy's 4109 program and is likely to be redressed by holding that the program is unlawful and enjoining preferential treatment of 4109 chaplains and the message it sends to appellants, they also meet the other prongs of the standing test, <i>see </i><i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 560-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because appellants have Article III standing, I do not reach the question whether they also have taxpayer standing.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Plaintiffs also include certain organizations of non-liturgical Protestant chaplains.

Hereinafter in referring to \"appellants,\" I refer only to the chaplains currently serving in the Navy Chaplain Corps.</p>\n<p>[2]  To the extent the court seeks to avoid this precedent by interpreting a footnote in <i>Chaplaincy</i> to indicate that the court was \"presupposing\" appellants' standing, Op. at 762-63, and thus addressing the request for injunctive relief without satisfying itself that appellants had standing, its approach is contrary both to the principle in <i>Steel Co.,</i> 523 U.S. at 94-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, and to the more natural reading of the footnote as merely recognizing, as this court has done before, that this prong of the preliminary injunction inquiry and the entirety of the Article III standing inquiry \"overlap[] ... somewhat,\" but are not coextensive, <i>see </i><i>Taylor,</i> 56 F.3d at 1508.</p>\n<p>[3]  According to appellants, \"the 4109 program\" has three parts: (1) illegal appointments to active duty through age waivers for over-age Catholic clergy, (2) the consequent illegal continuation of such clergy as chaplains to the age of 67, and (3) the eventual illegal transfer of such clergy to the Retired Reserve and subsequent recall to active duty as designated 4109 Reservists. The program is designed in part to allow Catholic chaplains who have reached their statutory separation age to continue to serve until they have completed twenty years of service and become eligible for pensions. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 1251, 14509, 14703; <i>see also </i><i>Chaplaincy,</i> 454 F.3d at 293-96. At the time appellants filed their complaints, the age limit for the appointment of chaplains, like other officers, was forty-two, <i>see</i> 10 U.S.C. § 532(a)(2); while this provision is no longer applicable to chaplains, <i>id.</i> at § 532(d)(1) (as amended by Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub.L. No. 108-375, 188 Stat. 1811, 1872 (Oct. 28, 2004)), the statutory separation age for chaplains and other officers remains in effect.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellants cite a list of Catholic chaplains coded as \"4109\" currently serving with them in the Navy Chaplain Corps, and assert that additional chaplains are destined to become 4109 chaplains in view of the Navy's list of Catholics appointed after age forty-two and extended on active duty and the dates they become eligible for pensions. For example, non-liturgical Protestant Chaplain Stewart served with over-age Catholic Chaplain Erestain. After this court's decision in <i>Chaplaincy,</i> it appears that the Navy extended two non-Catholic chaplains for service beyond the age of 62. <i>See</i> 454 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vasquez v.
