We affirm in part and reverse\n\nand remand in part.\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n                                     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       The litigation underlying this appeal arose in November 2004 and is based upon an oil and\n\ngas lease entered in 1972 between Charles Schroeder and Elsie and C.R. Schneider, as lessors, and\n\nLawrence Hoover, as lessee. In this action, the underlying Plaintiffs/Lessors (the Schroeder\n\nparties) sought declaratory judgment pronouncing the lease had terminated due to cessation of\n\nproduction. In addition, the Schroeder parties asserted causes of action for failure to file release,\n\ntrespass and bad faith pooling. In 2013, the Schroeder parties sought partial summary judgment\n\non only the declaratory-judgment action. The trial court granted the Schroeder parties’ motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, entered declaratory relief stating the subject lease terminated as of July\n\n1, 2003, and awarded attorney fees in the amount of $63,797.95 to be paid by defendant, Stephens\n\n& Johnson Operating Co. The trial court severed the remaining causes of action. The collective\n\nDefendants/Appellants (“Stephens and Johnson parties”) now appeal the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment in the declaratory-judgment action. In addition, Genessee Country Museum (Genessee)\n\nfiles its own, separate appeal from the trial court’s summary judgment.\n\nI.     Stephens and Johnson Parties’ Arguments\n\n       A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction to Enter Declaratory Relief\n\n       The Stephens and Johnson parties argue the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\n\nenter declaratory relief based upon the Schroeder parties’ failure to adequately allege, plead or\n\nprove a justiciable controversy existed. Because the existence of a justiciable controversy is\n\nnecessary to confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the Schroeder parties failed to allege, plead or\n\nprove a justiciable controversy existed, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to satisfy their burden to establish jurisdiction for declaratory relief. The Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties go on to argue that because the Schroeder parties failed to prove the Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties “ever actually denied that production had ceased or that the subject lease had\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nterminated” they failed to adequately plead or prove an actual controversy existed to confer subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\n         The Stephens and Johnson parties’ argument on appeal appears to pertain to two different\n\njurisdictional challenges: (1) a challenge to the sufficiency of the pleading to confer subject matter\n\njurisdiction; and (2) sufficiency of the summary judgment proof to establish the necessary\n\njurisdictional element of justiciable controversy. The Stephens and Johnson parties raise these\n\njurisdictional challenges for the first time on appeal. 1 Because these two challenges are reviewed\n\nunder different standards, this court will address each individually.\n\n         Under the Texas Declaratory Judgments Act, a court may declare the rights, status, and\n\nother legal relations of parties to an action. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.003(a) (West\n\n2015). Thus, a declaratory judgment is appropriate when a justiciable controversy exists as to the\n\nrights and status of the parties, and the controversy will be resolved by the declaration sought. Tex.\n\nHealth Care Info. Council v. Seton Health Plan, Inc., 94 S.W.3d 841, 846 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2002, pet. denied). However, a declaratory-judgment action is not appropriate if it would result in\n\ndetermination of a hypothetical or contingent situation or determination of questions not essential\n\nto the resolution of an actual controversy. Empire Life Ins. Co. of Amer. v. Moody, 584 S.W.2d\n\n855, 858 (Tex. 1979). “A controversy is considered justiciable … if there exists a real and\n\nsubstantial controversy involving a genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a\n\ntheoretical dispute. Otherwise, the judgment amounts to no more than an advisory opinion, which\n\nthe district court does not have power to render.” Tex. Health Care Info. Council, 94 S.W.3d at\n\n846.\n\n\n\n1\n Because the issue whether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court to determine,\na challenge to the trial court’s jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal. Rusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392\nS.W.3d 88, 94-97 (Tex. 2012); Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex. 1993)\n\n                                                          -3-\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n        Thus, to avoid rendition of an advisory opinion, a court’s subject matter jurisdiction in a\n\ndeclaratory-judgment action is dependent upon the existence of a justiciable controversy. Id. In a\n\ndeclaratory-judgment action, the plaintiff bears the burden to establish the existence of a justiciable\n\ncontroversy by showing the presence of contested issues which conclusively affect any adversary\n\nparties in interest. Hodges v. Brazos County Water Control and Improvement Dist. #1, Big Creek,\n\nBrazos County, 449 S.W.2d 861, 862 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1970, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n            1. Sufficiency of the Pleading to Establish Justiciable Controversy\n\n        Specific to this challenge, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend “unless a party’s\n\npleadings and evidence demonstrate an actual controversy between the parties, for example,\n\nwhether production has actually ceased …, then a declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act\n\nas to the status of the lease appears unnecessary and improper under Texas law.” Specifically, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ request for declaratory judgment that\n\n“the Lease has terminated”, alone, does not show there was a justiciable controversy between the\n\nparties to justify declaratory relief.\n\n        A plaintiff is obligated to plead facts affirmatively demonstrating the subject matter\n\njurisdiction of the trial court. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226\n\n(Tex. 2004). Courts must liberally construe the plaintiff’s petition, looking to the pleader’s intent\n\nand good faith allegations to determine whether the trial court holds jurisdiction. State v. Holland,\n\n221 S.W.3d 639, 642–43 (Tex. 2007). While a plaintiff should plead facts supporting jurisdiction,\n\nspecific allegations about subject matter jurisdiction are not required, and a plaintiff need not “put\n\non [its] case simply to establish jurisdiction.” Unifund CCR Partners v. Watson, 337 S.W.3d 922,\n\n925 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2011, no pet.).             Whether a plaintiff’s pleadings affirmatively\n\ndemonstrate subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks\n\n& Wildlife, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n                                                 -4-\n\f                                                                                        04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n        The face of the Fourth Amended Petition dispels the Stephens and Johnson parties’\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the pleading to confer subject matter jurisdiction. In the “Factual\n\nBackground” of their Fourth Amended Petition, the Schroeder parties request declaratory relief\n\nthat “the Court determine that the Lease has terminated.” Within their petition, the Schroeder\n\nparties state the relevant parties entered an oil and gas lease with a primary term, and subsequently,\n\nproduction began. The Schroeder parties allege production ceased and began again at a certain\n\ntime, but “[a]ccording to the records of the Railroad Commission of Texas, there was no\n\nproduction … for a seven (7) month period, beginning July 1, 2003 and ending on January 31,\n\n2004…. Moreover, there has been no production … since April 2005 to the present.” The\n\nSchroeder parties allege the cessation of production terminated the subject lease according to its\n\nterms. The Stephens and Johnson parties filed a general-denial answer, stating, they “den[y] each\n\nand every … allegation in said petition contained and says that the same are not true….”\n\n        The factual recitation in the Fourth Amended Petition dispels the Stephens and Johnson\n\nparties’ contention that the pleadings fail to allege “an actual controversy between the parties, for\n\nexample, whether production has actually ceased” to confer subject matter jurisdiction. Although\n\nthe Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ “request for declaratory judgment,\n\nalone, does not show there was a justiciable controversy between the parties to justify declaratory\n\nrelief”, the Schroeder parties are not tied to their request for declaratory relief, alone, to establish\n\nthe existence of a justiciable controversy. The facts, as alleged, do demonstrate a concrete\n\ncontested issue whether the lease terminated based upon cessation of production. This contested\n\nissue conclusively affects any adverse parties in interest, and therefore, demonstrates an actual,\n\njusticiable controversy to confer subject matter jurisdiction for declaratory relief. Although the\n\nSchroeder parties did not state specifically that a justiciable controversy exists, the facts alleged\n\nare sufficient to show the existence of a justiciable controversy. Thus, the facts alleged are\n                                                  -5-\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nsufficient to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction to hear the cause. Finally, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties’ general-denial answer further established a justiciable controversy\n\non the issue whether production had terminated and placed the requested declaratory relief in\n\ndispute.\n\n       For these reasons, the Schroeder parties’ Fourth Amended Petition alleges facts sufficient\n\nto demonstrate the existence of a justiciable controversy regarding whether the subject lease\n\nterminated under its terms. Thus, the Fourth Amended Petition demonstrates the trial court’s\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to confer the requested declaratory relief.\n\n           2. Sufficiency of Summary Judgment Proof to Establish Justiciable Controversy\n\n       Subsumed in the same argument, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the summary\n\njudgment proof offered to support the requested declaratory relief was insufficient to confer\n\nsummary judgment jurisdiction. The Stephens and Johnson parties contend the summary judgment\n\nevidence failed to demonstrate an actual controversy exists, that is, that production had ceased and\n\nwas “absolutely devoid of any allegation or suggestion that a true controversy existed between the\n\nparties with respect to the question of whether the subject lease had terminated due to non-\n\nproduction.” Curiously, the Stephens and Johnson parties state “there is no evidence that [the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties] ever actually denied that production had ceased or that the subject\n\nlease had terminated by operation of law.”\n\n       In support of their motion for declaratory-relief summary judgment, the Schroeder parties\n\nattached an affidavit and supplemental affidavit of Rex Howell. In these affidavits, Mr. Howell\n\nstated his opinion based upon review of the records of the Texas Railroad Commission. Mr.\n\nHowell attested his opinion consistent with the facts as alleged by the Schroeder parties: The\n\nnamed parties entered the subject oil and gas lease with a primary term of five years. Production\n\nbegan and ceased and began again at a certain time, until finally, according to the records of the\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                     04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nTexas Railroad Commission, “no gas production was recorded … for a seven month period from\n\nJuly, 2003 through January, 2004 and thereafter no production has been reported … since April\n\n2005 to the present.” Attached to Rex Howell’s affidavit are the records of the Texas Railroad\n\nCommission upon which his opinion is based. The Stephens and Johnson parties challenged the\n\nsufficiency of the pleading of the motion for summary judgment and challenged the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence through special exceptions for the same reasons presented on appeal; however, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties did not offer any controverting evidence.\n\n       This summary judgment evidence presented by the Schroeder parties dispels the Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties’ contention that the Schroeder parties failed to provide sufficient proof of an\n\nactual controversy between the parties to confer subject matter jurisdiction, that is, whether\n\nproduction had actually ceased. Mr. Howell’s affidavit and supplemental affidavit provide\n\nuncontested proof that production on the subject lease had ceased. Thus, the affidavits provide\n\nsufficient proof and a sufficient showing that an actual and justiciable controversy existed whether\n\nproduction on the subject well ceased and provided sufficient summary judgment evidence in\n\nsupport of the trial court’s ultimate finding.\n\n       With regard to the Stephens and Johnson parties’ contention that there is “no evidence that\n\n[they] ever actually denied that production had ceased”, this statement comes dangerously close\n\nto an admission that, in itself, would support the trial court’s summary judgment. However, in the\n\ncontext of the brief, as a whole, it appears the Stephens and Johnson parties intend to only advance\n\nan argument relative to the sufficiency of the pleadings and summary judgment proof. In any\n\nevent, the Schroeder parties need not provide proof of the Stephens and Johnson parties’ actual\n\ndenial, but need only provide proof of a justiciable controversy. In addition, the Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties’ general denial contained within their First Amended Answer is sufficient to\n\nestablish these parties denied that production on the subject oil and gas lease had ceased.\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                        04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n       For these reasons, the affidavit of Rex Howell is sufficient proof to demonstrate the trial\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction to confer the requested declaratory relief. The Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties provided no controverting evidence. Therefore, the summary judgment evidence\n\noffered is sufficient to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction to hear\n\nthe cause.\n\n       We overrule the Stephens and Johnson parties’ first issue.\n\n       B. Special Exception\n\n       In their second issue, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the trial court erred by\n\noverruling their special exceptions to the Schroeder parties’ motion for partial summary judgment.\n\nThe Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ request for summary judgment\n\n“to declare and determine the status of the Lease” was vague and ambiguous and did not provide\n\nsufficient notice of what the Schroeder parties were requesting.\n\n       Trial courts have broad discretion to sustain or deny special exceptions. Thus, we review\n\nthe trial court’s actions under the abuse of discretion standard of review. Kutch v. Del Mar College,\n\n831 S.W.2d 506, 508 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1992, no writ). The test for determination\n\nwhether a trial court abused its discretion is whether the trial court acted without reference to any\n\nguiding rules or principles or otherwise acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985). While uncommon, special\n\nexceptions are available in the context of a motion for summary judgment. The purpose of special\n\nexceptions focused upon a summary judgment motion is to ensure the parties and the trial court\n\nare focused on the same grounds. See McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337,\n\n342–43 (Tex. 1993).\n\n       We have reviewed the pleadings, the motion for summary judgment and responses, and the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties’ special exception. While the request for declaratory relief in the\n                                                  -8-\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nSchroeder parties’ motion for summary judgment, i.e. that the trial court “declare the status of the\n\nLease”, does appear non-specific and open-ended, the motion for summary judgment, as a whole,\n\ndoes provide reasonable notice of the basis of the requested relief. The body of the motion for\n\nsummary judgment states the same facts and representations as the Fourth Amended Petition. The\n\nalleged facts and argument within the Schroeder parties’ petition and motion for summary\n\njudgment provided sufficient notice to the Stephens and Johnson parties of the declaratory relief\n\nrequested and sufficiently guided the trial court in its determination.\n\n       Furthermore, the Stephens and Johnson parties’ special exception to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment was based upon the same argument presented on appeal, i.e. that the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to provide sufficient pleading of a justiciable controversy. For the same reasons as\n\nrecited above, the Schroeder parties did provide sufficient pleading of a justiciable controversy.\n\n       For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties’ special exception. The Stephens and Johnson parties’ second issue is overruled.\n\nII.    Genessee Country Museum\n\n       A. Pleading Sufficiency\n\n       In its’ first issue, Genessee contends the trial court erred by granting the declaratory relief\n\nagainst it because the Schroeder parties’ Fourth Amended Petition never established that Genessee\n\nwas a party or signatory to the subject Lease. Because the petition states only that Genessee owns\n\nan interest in the lease, Genessee contends this pleading is insufficient to assert causes of action\n\nagainst it and insufficient to award declaratory relief against it. Genessee asserts this matter of\n\navoidance for the first time on appeal.\n\n       To properly preserve error for appellate review, a party must make a timely, specific\n\nobjection to the trial court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). The party who fails to make a timely\n\nobjection or fails to raise a pleading deficiency before submission of the case cannot later raise the\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\npleading deficiency for the first time on appeal. Roark v. Stallworth Oil and Gas, Inc., 813 S.W.2d\n\n492, 495 (Tex. 1991).\n\n       In Genessee’s original answer and subsequent amended answers, it entered a general denial\n\nand at no time in the 11-year litigation of this matter did Genessee assert a challenge to the\n\nsufficiency of the pleadings or otherwise challenge the Schroeder parties’ ability to assert a cause\n\nof action against it. Genessee never challenged the trial court’s authority to award the requested\n\ndeclaratory relief against it. Genessee failed to raise this challenge in its response to summary\n\njudgement or at any time before the trial court rendered declaratory judgment.\n\n       Because Genessee failed to raise this challenge, the Schroeder parties’ action against\n\nGenessee was effectively tried by consent. Accordingly, Genessee failed to preserve any alleged\n\nerror regarding a challenge to the sufficiency of the pleading or the Schroeder parties’ ability to\n\nassert a cause of action against it, and thus, has waived this complaint for appeal. See id.\n\n       Notwithstanding lack of preservation of error, however, Genessee’s contention is without\n\nmerit. In a declaratory judgment action, all parties who have or who claim any interest that would\n\nbe affected by the requested declaration must be made parties. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 37.006(a) (West 2015). Genessee does not deny that it holds a claim or interest in the\n\nsubject lease that would be affected by the requested declaratory relief. Therefore, Genessee is a\n\nproper party.\n\n       For these reasons, Genessee’s first issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n       B. Other Controversies\n\n       In its second point of issue, Genessee asserts the trial court erred by awarding declaratory\n\nrelief when other controversies existed and survived. Genessee’s argument with regard to this\n\nissue on appeal consists entirely of the following:\n\n       Finally, the trial court should not render a declaratory judgment when other\n       controversies exist between the parties. Willacy Cty. Appr. Dist. v. No. Alamo\n       Waters., 676 S.W.2d 632, 642 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1984, ref. n.r.e.) In this\n       instance, the Plaintiffs still have a bad faith pooling claim, a failure to file release\n       claim, and a trespass claim before the court.\n\n       Genessee’s second issue on appeal provides no argument stating specific reasons the trial\n\ncourt’s severance was erroneous. Because Genessee provides no argument or extrapolation on the\n\nground or basis of error, this argument is not sufficiently developed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1.\n\nThis court cannot decide an issue on appeal without proper argument and authority showing why\n\nthe actions of the trial court were in error. Foster v. State, 101 S.W.3d 490, 499 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.). To present appellate argument, an appellant must go further\n\nthan just merely stating an issue, but must present argument and cite supporting authority. Bechtel\n\nCorp. v. City of San Antonio, No. 04-04-00910-CV, 2006 WL 228689, at *2 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 2006, no pet.); Wilson & Wilson Tax Servs., Inc. v. Mohammed, 131 S.W.3d 231, 242\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\n       By failing to properly brief the issue presented, Genessee presents nothing for review on\n\nappeal because an appellate court cannot speculate as to the arguments that could have been\n\nbrought or attempt to formulate arguments for a party. See Wilson & Wilson Tax Servs., Inc., 131\n\nS.W.3d at 242.\n\n       We do note that Genessee did cite a case to support this point, however, this cited case only\n\nprovides the general rule regarding a trial court’s broad authority and discretion to grant or deny a\n\nseverance. Without presentation of a ground or challenge to a trial court’s ruling, Genessee’s\n                                                - 11 -\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nargument is not sufficiently developed or presented for appellate review. See Foster, 101 S.W.3d\n\nat 499.\n\n          Therefore, we hold this issue on appeal is inadequately briefed, and, as such, is waived.\n\nIII.      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n          In the Stephens and Johnson parties’ and Genessee’s final issue on appeal, the parties\n\ncontend the trial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees to the Schroeder parties. The Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties argue, among other things, that the Schroeder parties are not entitled to an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees on summary judgment because they did not move for attorneys’ fees in\n\ntheir motion for summary judgment or supplemental motion for summary judgment.\n\n          Genessee argues the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees because the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to segregate the attorney fees relative to the declaratory-judgment action from the\n\nremaining causes of action and because the Schroeder parties failed to prove the awarded\n\nattorneys’ fees were reasonable. In addition, Genessee argues a fact issue existed regarding\n\nreasonable attorney fees.\n\n          Summary judgment cannot be granted except on the grounds expressly presented in the\n\nmotion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“The motion for summary judgment shall state the specific\n\ngrounds therefor.”); Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 912 (Tex. 1997); McConnell,\n\n858 S.W.2d at 341 (Tex. 1993). In determining whether grounds are expressly presented, reliance\n\nmay not be placed on the briefs or summary judgment evidence. See McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at\n\n341; Torres v. Garcia, No. 04-11-00822-CV, 2012 WL 3808593, at *5 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). Accordingly, “[s]pecific grounds for summary judgment must be\n\nexpressly stated in the motion for summary judgment itself and not ... in the summary judgment\n\nevidence....” McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 344; Torres, 2012 WL 3808593, at *5. Therefore, a\n\nparty’s request for attorney fees and the grounds supporting this request must be expressly stated\n                                                 - 12 -\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nin the motion before a court may award summary judgment on the stated grounds. McConnell,\n\n858 S.W.2d at 341; Torres, 2012 WL 3808593, at *5.\n\n       Review of the Schroeder parties’ motion for summary judgment and supplemental motion\n\nfor summary judgment reveal there is no request for, or statement of any ground for, the recovery\n\nof attorneys’ fees. The motions are completely silent on the issue and address only the request for\n\ndeclaratory relief. The Schroeder parties plead for attorneys’ fees in their Fourth Amended Petition\n\nand did attach an affidavit pertinent to recovery of attorneys’ fees, with attached invoice, to their\n\nsupplemental motion for summary judgment. The affidavit was an attestation of one of the\n\nSchroeder parties’ attorneys and pertained to the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’\n\nfees the attorney believed were due.\n\n       While the Schroeder parties did provide an affidavit pertinent to an award of attorneys’\n\nfees and did plead for an award of attorneys’ fees, they failed to request or state any ground for the\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees within their motion for summary judgment. Because the trial court\n\nmay not rely upon the pleadings or summary judgment evidence as support for a summary\n\njudgment award, the trial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees through a summary judgment\n\naward. See McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 344; Torres, 2012 WL 3808593, at *5.\n\n       Accordingly, because we cannot affirm a summary judgment on grounds not stated in the\n\nmotion, we sustain the Stephens and Johnson’s parties’ second issue on appeal. Because this\n\ndisposition requires reversal of the trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees, we do not address\n\nGenessee’s independent challenge to the award.\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the portion of the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nwith regard to the declaratory relief granted. We reverse the trial court’s summary judgment with\n\nregard to the award of attorneys’ fees to be paid by the Stephens and Johnson parties and remand\n\nfor further discretionary proceedings on that issue.\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                  04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nAccordingly, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n                                         Jason Pulliam, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\f",

We affirm in part and reverse\n\nand remand in part.\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n                                     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       The litigation underlying this appeal arose in November 2004 and is based upon an oil and\n\ngas lease entered in 1972 between Charles Schroeder and Elsie and C.R. Schneider, as lessors, and\n\nLawrence Hoover, as lessee. In this action, the underlying Plaintiffs/Lessors (the Schroeder\n\nparties) sought declaratory judgment pronouncing the lease had terminated due to cessation of\n\nproduction. In addition, the Schroeder parties asserted causes of action for failure to file release,\n\ntrespass and bad faith pooling. In 2013, the Schroeder parties sought partial summary judgment\n\non only the declaratory-judgment action. The trial court granted the Schroeder parties’ motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, entered declaratory relief stating the subject lease terminated as of July\n\n1, 2003, and awarded attorney fees in the amount of $63,797.95 to be paid by defendant, Stephens\n\n& Johnson Operating Co. The trial court severed the remaining causes of action. The collective\n\nDefendants/Appellants (“Stephens and Johnson parties”) now appeal the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment in the declaratory-judgment action. In addition, Genessee Country Museum (Genessee)\n\nfiles its own, separate appeal from the trial court’s summary judgment.\n\nI.     Stephens and Johnson Parties’ Arguments\n\n       A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction to Enter Declaratory Relief\n\n       The Stephens and Johnson parties argue the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\n\nenter declaratory relief based upon the Schroeder parties’ failure to adequately allege, plead or\n\nprove a justiciable controversy existed. Because the existence of a justiciable controversy is\n\nnecessary to confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the Schroeder parties failed to allege, plead or\n\nprove a justiciable controversy existed, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to satisfy their burden to establish jurisdiction for declaratory relief. The Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties go on to argue that because the Schroeder parties failed to prove the Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties “ever actually denied that production had ceased or that the subject lease had\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nterminated” they failed to adequately plead or prove an actual controversy existed to confer subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\n         The Stephens and Johnson parties’ argument on appeal appears to pertain to two different\n\njurisdictional challenges: (1) a challenge to the sufficiency of the pleading to confer subject matter\n\njurisdiction; and (2) sufficiency of the summary judgment proof to establish the necessary\n\njurisdictional element of justiciable controversy. The Stephens and Johnson parties raise these\n\njurisdictional challenges for the first time on appeal. 1 Because these two challenges are reviewed\n\nunder different standards, this court will address each individually.\n\n         Under the Texas Declaratory Judgments Act, a court may declare the rights, status, and\n\nother legal relations of parties to an action. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.003(a) (West\n\n2015). Thus, a declaratory judgment is appropriate when a justiciable controversy exists as to the\n\nrights and status of the parties, and the controversy will be resolved by the declaration sought. Tex.\n\nHealth Care Info. Council v. Seton Health Plan, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773896\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773896/texas-health-care-v-seton-health-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2002, pet. denied). However, a declaratory-judgment action is not appropriate if it would result in\n\ndetermination of a hypothetical or contingent situation or determination of questions not essential\n\nto the resolution of an actual controversy. Empire Life Ins. Co. of Amer. v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757986\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757986/empire-life-ins-co-of-america-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (Tex. 1979). “A controversy is considered justiciable … if there exists a real and\n\nsubstantial controversy involving a genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a\n\ntheoretical dispute.

Council, 94 S.W.3d at\n\n846.\n\n\n\n1\n Because the issue whether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court to determine,\na challenge to the trial court’s jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal.

Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94-97 (Tex. 2012); Tex.

Id. In a\n\ndeclaratory-judgment action, the plaintiff bears the burden to establish the existence of a justiciable\n\ncontroversy by showing the presence of contested issues which conclusively affect any adversary\n\nparties in interest.

Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1970, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n            1. Sufficiency of the Pleading to Establish Justiciable Controversy\n\n        Specific to this challenge, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend “unless a party’s\n\npleadings and evidence demonstrate an actual controversy between the parties, for example,\n\nwhether production has actually ceased …, then a declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act\n\nas to the status of the lease appears unnecessary and improper under Texas law.” Specifically, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ request for declaratory judgment that\n\n“the Lease has terminated”, alone, does not show there was a justiciable controversy between the\n\nparties to justify declaratory relief.\n\n        A plaintiff is obligated to plead facts affirmatively demonstrating the subject matter\n\njurisdiction of the trial court.

Dep’t of Parks\n\n& Wildlife, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n                                                 -4-\n\f                                                                                        04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n        The face of the Fourth Amended Petition dispels the Stephens and Johnson parties’\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the pleading to confer subject matter jurisdiction. In the “Factual\n\nBackground” of their Fourth Amended Petition, the Schroeder parties request declaratory relief\n\nthat “the Court determine that the Lease has terminated.” Within their petition, the Schroeder\n\nparties state the relevant parties entered an oil and gas lease with a primary term, and subsequently,\n\nproduction began. The Schroeder parties allege production ceased and began again at a certain\n\ntime, but “[a]ccording to the records of the Railroad Commission of Texas, there was no\n\nproduction … for a seven (7) month period, beginning July 1, 2003 and ending on January 31,\n\n2004…. Moreover, there has been no production … since April 2005 to the present.” The\n\nSchroeder parties allege the cessation of production terminated the subject lease according to its\n\nterms. The Stephens and Johnson parties filed a general-denial answer, stating, they “den[y] each\n\nand every … allegation in said petition contained and says that the same are not true….”\n\n        The factual recitation in the Fourth Amended Petition dispels the Stephens and Johnson\n\nparties’ contention that the pleadings fail to allege “an actual controversy between the parties, for\n\nexample, whether production has actually ceased” to confer subject matter jurisdiction. Although\n\nthe Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ “request for declaratory judgment,\n\nalone, does not show there was a justiciable controversy between the parties to justify declaratory\n\nrelief”, the Schroeder parties are not tied to their request for declaratory relief, alone, to establish\n\nthe existence of a justiciable controversy. The facts, as alleged, do demonstrate a concrete\n\ncontested issue whether the lease terminated based upon cessation of production. This contested\n\nissue conclusively affects any adverse parties in interest, and therefore, demonstrates an actual,\n\njusticiable controversy to confer subject matter jurisdiction for declaratory relief. Although the\n\nSchroeder parties did not state specifically that a justiciable controversy exists, the facts alleged\n\nare sufficient to show the existence of a justiciable controversy. Thus, the facts alleged are\n                                                  -5-\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nsufficient to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction to hear the cause. Finally, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties’ general-denial answer further established a justiciable controversy\n\non the issue whether production had terminated and placed the requested declaratory relief in\n\ndispute.\n\n       For these reasons, the Schroeder parties’ Fourth Amended Petition alleges facts sufficient\n\nto demonstrate the existence of a justiciable controversy regarding whether the subject lease\n\nterminated under its terms. Thus, the Fourth Amended Petition demonstrates the trial court’s\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to confer the requested declaratory relief.\n\n           2. Sufficiency of Summary Judgment Proof to Establish Justiciable Controversy\n\n       Subsumed in the same argument, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the summary\n\njudgment proof offered to support the requested declaratory relief was insufficient to confer\n\nsummary judgment jurisdiction. The Stephens and Johnson parties contend the summary judgment\n\nevidence failed to demonstrate an actual controversy exists, that is, that production had ceased and\n\nwas “absolutely devoid of any allegation or suggestion that a true controversy existed between the\n\nparties with respect to the question of whether the subject lease had terminated due to non-\n\nproduction.” Curiously, the Stephens and Johnson parties state “there is no evidence that [the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties] ever actually denied that production had ceased or that the subject\n\nlease had terminated by operation of law.”\n\n       In support of their motion for declaratory-relief summary judgment, the Schroeder parties\n\nattached an affidavit and supplemental affidavit of Rex Howell. In these affidavits, Mr. Howell\n\nstated his opinion based upon review of the records of the Texas Railroad Commission. Mr.\n\nHowell attested his opinion consistent with the facts as alleged by the Schroeder parties: The\n\nnamed parties entered the subject oil and gas lease with a primary term of five years. Production\n\nbegan and ceased and began again at a certain time, until finally, according to the records of the\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                     04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nTexas Railroad Commission, “no gas production was recorded … for a seven month period from\n\nJuly, 2003 through January, 2004 and thereafter no production has been reported … since April\n\n2005 to the present.” Attached to Rex Howell’s affidavit are the records of the Texas Railroad\n\nCommission upon which his opinion is based. The Stephens and Johnson parties challenged the\n\nsufficiency of the pleading of the motion for summary judgment and challenged the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence through special exceptions for the same reasons presented on appeal; however, the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties did not offer any controverting evidence.\n\n       This summary judgment evidence presented by the Schroeder parties dispels the Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties’ contention that the Schroeder parties failed to provide sufficient proof of an\n\nactual controversy between the parties to confer subject matter jurisdiction, that is, whether\n\nproduction had actually ceased. Mr. Howell’s affidavit and supplemental affidavit provide\n\nuncontested proof that production on the subject lease had ceased. Thus, the affidavits provide\n\nsufficient proof and a sufficient showing that an actual and justiciable controversy existed whether\n\nproduction on the subject well ceased and provided sufficient summary judgment evidence in\n\nsupport of the trial court’s ultimate finding.\n\n       With regard to the Stephens and Johnson parties’ contention that there is “no evidence that\n\n[they] ever actually denied that production had ceased”, this statement comes dangerously close\n\nto an admission that, in itself, would support the trial court’s summary judgment. However, in the\n\ncontext of the brief, as a whole, it appears the Stephens and Johnson parties intend to only advance\n\nan argument relative to the sufficiency of the pleadings and summary judgment proof. In any\n\nevent, the Schroeder parties need not provide proof of the Stephens and Johnson parties’ actual\n\ndenial, but need only provide proof of a justiciable controversy. In addition, the Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties’ general denial contained within their First Amended Answer is sufficient to\n\nestablish these parties denied that production on the subject oil and gas lease had ceased.\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                        04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n       For these reasons, the affidavit of Rex Howell is sufficient proof to demonstrate the trial\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction to confer the requested declaratory relief. The Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties provided no controverting evidence. Therefore, the summary judgment evidence\n\noffered is sufficient to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction to hear\n\nthe cause.\n\n       We overrule the Stephens and Johnson parties’ first issue.\n\n       B. Special Exception\n\n       In their second issue, the Stephens and Johnson parties contend the trial court erred by\n\noverruling their special exceptions to the Schroeder parties’ motion for partial summary judgment.\n\nThe Stephens and Johnson parties contend the Schroeder parties’ request for summary judgment\n\n“to declare and determine the status of the Lease” was vague and ambiguous and did not provide\n\nsufficient notice of what the Schroeder parties were requesting.\n\n       Trial courts have broad discretion to sustain or deny special exceptions. Thus, we review\n\nthe trial court’s actions under the abuse of discretion standard of review. Kutch v. Del Mar College,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1532212\"><a href=\"/opinion/1532212/kutch-v-del-mar-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508 (Tex.

The test for determination\n\nwhether a trial court abused its discretion is whether the trial court acted without reference to any\n\nguiding rules or principles or otherwise acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.

While uncommon, special\n\nexceptions are available in the context of a motion for summary judgment. The purpose of special\n\nexceptions focused upon a summary judgment motion is to ensure the parties and the trial court\n\nare focused on the same grounds. See McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746247\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746247/mcconnell-v-southside-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n342–43 (Tex. 1993).\n\n       We have reviewed the pleadings, the motion for summary judgment and responses, and the\n\nStephens and Johnson parties’ special exception. While the request for declaratory relief in the\n                                                  -8-\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nSchroeder parties’ motion for summary judgment, i.e. that the trial court “declare the status of the\n\nLease”, does appear non-specific and open-ended, the motion for summary judgment, as a whole,\n\ndoes provide reasonable notice of the basis of the requested relief. The body of the motion for\n\nsummary judgment states the same facts and representations as the Fourth Amended Petition. The\n\nalleged facts and argument within the Schroeder parties’ petition and motion for summary\n\njudgment provided sufficient notice to the Stephens and Johnson parties of the declaratory relief\n\nrequested and sufficiently guided the trial court in its determination.\n\n       Furthermore, the Stephens and Johnson parties’ special exception to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment was based upon the same argument presented on appeal, i.e. that the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to provide sufficient pleading of a justiciable controversy. For the same reasons as\n\nrecited above, the Schroeder parties did provide sufficient pleading of a justiciable controversy.\n\n       For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Stephens and\n\nJohnson parties’ special exception. The Stephens and Johnson parties’ second issue is overruled.\n\nII.    Genessee Country Museum\n\n       A. Pleading Sufficiency\n\n       In its’ first issue, Genessee contends the trial court erred by granting the declaratory relief\n\nagainst it because the Schroeder parties’ Fourth Amended Petition never established that Genessee\n\nwas a party or signatory to the subject Lease. Because the petition states only that Genessee owns\n\nan interest in the lease, Genessee contends this pleading is insufficient to assert causes of action\n\nagainst it and insufficient to award declaratory relief against it. Genessee asserts this matter of\n\navoidance for the first time on appeal.\n\n       To properly preserve error for appellate review, a party must make a timely, specific\n\nobjection to the trial court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). The party who fails to make a timely\n\nobjection or fails to raise a pleading deficiency before submission of the case cannot later raise the\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                      04-14-00167-CV\n\n\npleading deficiency for the first time on appeal. Roark v. Stallworth Oil and Gas, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534849\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534849/roark-v-stallworth-oil-and-gas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (Tex. 1991).\n\n       In Genessee’s original answer and subsequent amended answers, it entered a general denial\n\nand at no time in the 11-year litigation of this matter did Genessee assert a challenge to the\n\nsufficiency of the pleadings or otherwise challenge the Schroeder parties’ ability to assert a cause\n\nof action against it. Genessee never challenged the trial court’s authority to award the requested\n\ndeclaratory relief against it. Genessee failed to raise this challenge in its response to summary\n\njudgement or at any time before the trial court rendered declaratory judgment.\n\n       Because Genessee failed to raise this challenge, the Schroeder parties’ action against\n\nGenessee was effectively tried by consent. Accordingly, Genessee failed to preserve any alleged\n\nerror regarding a challenge to the sufficiency of the pleading or the Schroeder parties’ ability to\n\nassert a cause of action against it, and thus, has waived this complaint for appeal. See id.\n\n       Notwithstanding lack of preservation of error, however, Genessee’s contention is without\n\nmerit. In a declaratory judgment action, all parties who have or who claim any interest that would\n\nbe affected by the requested declaration must be made parties. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 37.006(a) (West 2015). Genessee does not deny that it holds a claim or interest in the\n\nsubject lease that would be affected by the requested declaratory relief. Therefore, Genessee is a\n\nproper party.\n\n       For these reasons, Genessee’s first issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\n       B. Other Controversies\n\n       In its second point of issue, Genessee asserts the trial court erred by awarding declaratory\n\nrelief when other controversies existed and survived. Genessee’s argument with regard to this\n\nissue on appeal consists entirely of the following:\n\n       Finally, the trial court should not render a declaratory judgment when other\n       controversies exist between the parties.

In this\n       instance, the Plaintiffs still have a bad faith pooling claim, a failure to file release\n       claim, and a trespass claim before the court.\n\n       Genessee’s second issue on appeal provides no argument stating specific reasons the trial\n\ncourt’s severance was erroneous. Because Genessee provides no argument or extrapolation on the\n\nground or basis of error, this argument is not sufficiently developed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1.\n\nThis court cannot decide an issue on appeal without proper argument and authority showing why\n\nthe actions of the trial court were in error. Foster v.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\n       By failing to properly brief the issue presented, Genessee presents nothing for review on\n\nappeal because an appellate court cannot speculate as to the arguments that could have been\n\nbrought or attempt to formulate arguments for a party. See Wilson & Wilson Tax Servs., Inc., 131\n\nS.W.3d at 242.\n\n       We do note that Genessee did cite a case to support this point, however, this cited case only\n\nprovides the general rule regarding a trial court’s broad authority and discretion to grant or deny a\n\nseverance. Without presentation of a ground or challenge to a trial court’s ruling, Genessee’s\n                                                - 11 -\n\f                                                                                       04-14-00167-CV\n\n\nargument is not sufficiently developed or presented for appellate review. See Foster, 101 S.W.3d\n\nat 499.\n\n          Therefore, we hold this issue on appeal is inadequately briefed, and, as such, is waived.\n\nIII.      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n          In the Stephens and Johnson parties’ and Genessee’s final issue on appeal, the parties\n\ncontend the trial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees to the Schroeder parties. The Stephens\n\nand Johnson parties argue, among other things, that the Schroeder parties are not entitled to an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees on summary judgment because they did not move for attorneys’ fees in\n\ntheir motion for summary judgment or supplemental motion for summary judgment.\n\n          Genessee argues the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees because the Schroeder\n\nparties failed to segregate the attorney fees relative to the declaratory-judgment action from the\n\nremaining causes of action and because the Schroeder parties failed to prove the awarded\n\nattorneys’ fees were reasonable. In addition, Genessee argues a fact issue existed regarding\n\nreasonable attorney fees.\n\n          Summary judgment cannot be granted except on the grounds expressly presented in the\n\nmotion.

The motions are completely silent on the issue and address only the request for\n\ndeclaratory relief. The Schroeder parties plead for attorneys’ fees in their Fourth Amended Petition\n\nand did attach an affidavit pertinent to recovery of attorneys’ fees, with attached invoice, to their\n\nsupplemental motion for summary judgment. The affidavit was an attestation of one of the\n\nSchroeder parties’ attorneys and pertained to the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’\n\nfees the attorney believed were due.\n\n       While the Schroeder parties did provide an affidavit pertinent to an award of attorneys’\n\nfees and did plead for an award of attorneys’ fees, they failed to request or state any ground for the\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees within their motion for summary judgment. Because the trial court\n\nmay not rely upon the pleadings or summary judgment evidence as support for a summary\n\njudgment award, the trial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees through a summary judgment\n\naward.
