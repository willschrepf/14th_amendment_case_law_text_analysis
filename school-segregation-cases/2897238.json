He was denied entry.\nThe Kamehameha Schools were created through a charitable\ntestamentary trust, established by the last direct descendant of\n\f19054               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nthe Hawaiian monarchy, for the education and upbringing of\nNative Hawaiians. As a result, the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy gives preference to students of Hawaiian\nancestry. Plaintiff argues that he was denied admission\nbecause of his race in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\n\n   The majority of a three-judge panel held that the Kameha-\nmeha Schools’ admissions policy, with its preference for\nNative Hawaiians, constituted unlawful race discrimination\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981.1 We took this case en banc to recon-\nsider whether a Hawaiian private, non-profit K-12 school that\nreceives no federal funds violates § 1981 by preferring Native\nHawaiians in its admissions policy. We now answer “no” to\nthat question and, accordingly, affirm the district court.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n  A.       Factual Background\n\n      1.    Historical Context2\n\n   The islands of Hawaii are geographically isolated in the\nSouth Pacific Ocean and were originally settled sometime\nbetween 1 and 750 A.D. The Native Hawaiians developed a\nwell-organized, efficient, and thriving civilization “based on\na communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language,\nculture, and religion.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512. The land, abundant\nin natural resources, allowed the Native Hawaiians to thrive.\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs, Native Hawaiian Rights Hand-\nbook 3 (Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie ed. 1991) (hereinaf-\nter “Rights Handbook”).\n  1\n    Doe v. Kamehameha Sch./Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, 416 F.3d\n1025 (9th Cir. 2005), reh’g en banc granted, 441 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir.\n2006).\n  2\n    This general information simply sets the stage for our more particular\nconsideration of the educational status of Native Hawaiian children.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19055\n   The first Western contact with the Hawaiian islands\noccurred in 1778 when Captain James Cook landed on the\nisland of Kauai. The immediate result of that first encounter\nwas that Native Hawaiians were introduced to Western goods\nand Western diseases. “By 1919, the Native Hawaiian popula-\ntion had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an\nalarming 22,600.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(7). But see Rice v. Caye-\ntano, 528 U.S. 495, 500 (2000) (estimating the population in\n1778 as between 200,000 and 300,000).\n\n   In 1810, Kamehameha I created a unified monarchy over\nall the Hawaiian Islands, becoming the first King of Hawaii\nand affording the islands a level of cohesion and security that\nthey had not previously known. The United States officially\nrecognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1826\nand, from 1843 until 1893, extended full diplomatic recogni-\ntion to the islands. Other countries, too—including Great Brit-\nain, France, and Japan—recognized the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(1). Before 1893, the United States entered\ninto a number of treaties for peace, friendship, and commerce\nwith the Kingdom. U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of the\nInterior, From Mauka to Makai: The River of Justice Must\nFlow Freely 1 (Oct. 23, 2000) (hereinafter “From Mauka to\nMakai”). The first treaty was signed in 1826, and additional\ntreaties were signed in 1849, 1875, and 1887. See Rice, 528\nU.S. at 504 (discussing the history of diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii before\nthe overthrow of the monarchy).\n\n   The Kingdom of Hawaii, located along shipping and fish-\ning routes, was commercially desirable. Initially, trade with\nthe Kingdom of Hawaii revolved around the islands’ fur and\nsandalwood resources, as well as the whaling industry. Rights\nHandbook at 5. When over-harvesting destroyed the sandal-\nwood trade and depleted the whaling stocks, wealthy West-\nerners turned to large-scale plantations, primarily growing\nsugar, to make money. Id. As foreign investment became\nmore and more tied to land ownership, demand for change in\n\f19056             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nthe traditional land tenure system, which did not provide for\nindividual land titles, intensified. Id. at 6. Pressure from West-\nerners eventually led the Hawaiian government to reject the\nland tenure system in favor of privatized land ownership,\nwhich allowed Westerners “[w]ith a permanent population of\nfewer than two thousand” to take “over most of Hawaii’s land\nin the next half-century and manipulate[ ] the economy for\ntheir own profit.” Neil M. Levy, Native Hawaiian Land\nRights, 63 Cal. L. Rev. 848, 857-58 (1975) (footnote omitted).\n\n   Western economic domination of the Hawaiian Islands was\nfollowed by an interest in establishing political control. Id. at\n861. “In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally rec-\nognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom\nof Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-\nHawaiians, including United States citizens, who were\nassisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United\nStates naval representative, and armed naval forces of the\nUnited States.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(5). The United States\nannexed Hawaii not long thereafter. Id. § 7512(6). Laws were\nthen enacted suppressing the Hawaiian culture and language\nand allowing for the displacement of Native Hawaiians from\ntheir lands. From 1896 to 1986, almost a full century, the\nHawaiian language was banned as a medium of instruction in\nschools. Id. § 7512(19). Hula, a Native Hawaiian dance form,\nand local healing practices also had been banned during the\nwesternization of the islands. Such measures resulted in “mor-\ntality, disease, economic deprivation, social distress and popu-\nlation decline.” From Mauka to Makai at 1.\n\n   Hawaii finally attained statehood in 1959. Rights Handbook\nat 18. More than 30 years later, in recognition of the United\nStates’ role in the overthrow of the independent Hawaiian\nmonarchy, Congress officially apologized to the Hawaiian\npeople and expressed its commitment to “provide a proper\nfoundation for reconciliation between the United States and\nthe Native Hawaiian people.” 1993 Apology Resolution, Pub.\nL. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (1993).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19057\n      2.   The Kamehameha Schools\n\n   The Kamehameha Schools were created under a “charitable\ntestamentary trust established by the last direct descendent of\nKing Kamehameha I, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who\nleft her property in trust for a school dedicated to the educa-\ntion and upbringing of Native Hawaiians.” Burgert v. Loke-\nlani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust, 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir.\n2000). Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop’s will provided for the\nerection and maintenance of schools in the Hawaiian Islands,\ncalled the Kamehameha Schools, on the Hawaiian monar-\nchy’s ancestral lands, with the purpose of providing “a good\neducation in the common English branches, and also instruc-\ntion in morals and in such useful knowledge as may tend to\nmake good and industrious men and women.” Will of Bernice\nPauahi Bishop, reprinted in Wills and Deeds of Trust 17-18\n(3d ed. 1957) (hereinafter “Pauahi Bishop Will”). The Pauahi\nBishop Will also bestowed on the “trustees full power to\nmake all such rules and regulations as they may deem neces-\nsary for the government of said schools and to regulate the\nadmission of pupils.” Id. at 18.\n\n   Under the direction of the original trustees, chaired by\nPauahi Bishop’s widower, Charles Reed Bishop, the Kameha-\nmeha Schools opened in the late nineteenth century.3 During\na speech on the Schools’ first Founder’s Day, in December\n1888, Charles Reed Bishop stated that Princess Bernice\nPauahi Bishop had created the Kamehameha Schools, “in\nwhich Hawaiians have the preference,” so that “her own peo-\nple” could once again thrive. Charles R. Bishop, The Purpose\nof the Schools, Handicraft, Jan. 1889, at 3.\n\n  In 1910, not long after the death of Princess Bernice Pauahi\n  3\n    The Pauahi Bishop Will established two separate schools, one for boys\nand one for girls. The boys’ school opened in 1887 and the girls’ school\nin 1894. During the 1965-1966 school year, the two schools were consoli-\ndated.\n\f19058            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nBishop and the creation of the Kamehameha Schools, the\nquestion arose as to who should be admitted to the Schools.\nCobey Black & Kathleen Mellen, Princess Pauahi Bishop\nand Her Legacy 155 (The Kamehameha Schools Press 1965).\nCharles Bishop wrote to the trustees: “Mrs. Bishop intended\nthat, in the advantages of her beneficence, those of her race\nshould have preference.” Id. Accordingly, he concluded that\nthe principal of the Schools was justified in refusing to admit\na student who had no native Hawaiian ancestry. Id. Bishop\nwent on to convey that only if Native Hawaiians failed to\napply to the Schools, or if conditions changed fundamentally,\nshould admissions be opened to other ethnicities: “It was wise\nto prepare for and to admit natives only and I do not think the\ntime has come to depart from that rule.” Id.\n\n   Today, the Kamehameha Schools operate three K-12 cam-\npuses: Kapalama on the island of Oahu, Pukalani on the\nisland of Maui, and Keaau on the island of Hawaii. There are\nabout 70,000 school-aged children in Hawaii who meet the\nSchools’ definition of Native Hawaiian, but the Schools’ total\nenrollment is only about 4,856 students. The Kamehameha\nSchools subsidize much of the tuition cost for all students,\nrequiring payment of only $1,784 per year, whereas the cost\nof educating a student amounts to about $20,000 annually.\nSixty-five percent of those enrolled receive some form of\nfinancial aid to help them pay even that heavily subsidized,\nmodest tuition.\n\n   Part of the Kamehameha Schools’ stated admissions policy\nis to give preference to students of Native Hawaiian ancestry,\ndefined to include any person descended from the aboriginal\npeople who exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands\nprior to 1778. Practically, the policy operates to admit stu-\ndents without any Hawaiian ancestry only after all qualified\napplicants with such ancestry have been admitted. Because\nthere are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry\nthan there are available places at the Schools, it is very rare\nthat a student with no Hawaiian ancestry is admitted to the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19059\ncampus programs. But the admissions policy is not an abso-\nlute bar to non-Native Hawaiians; instead, it is intended to last\nonly for so long as Native Hawaiians suffer educational disad-\nvantages.\n\n   We pause to note that the Schools’ policy contains no\nrequirement for a minimum blood quantum of Hawaiian\nancestry. The only requirement is that a student have at least\none Native Hawaiian ancestor. Most students have mixed\nancestry. More than 60 different racial and ethnic groups have\nbeen represented in the student body, and for the 2000-2001\nacademic year, students reported belonging to 39 different\nracial and ethnic groups. Accordingly, an observer visiting the\nSchools would see visible diversity notwithstanding the stu-\ndents’ commonality of having at least one Native Hawaiian\nancestor.\n\n  The Kamehameha Schools follow a “Leadership Model” of\neducation. This curriculum is meant to foster the self-esteem\nand self-identity of students as individuals of Native Hawaiian\ndescent by teaching Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, lan-\nguage, and tradition, in addition to general college-\npreparatory courses.\n\n   Kamehameha Schools also operate a number of other edu-\ncational programs, including pre-schools, enrichment pro-\ngrams, and summer school programs. In those programs, the\nadmission of non-Native Hawaiians occurs more often. For\nexample, for the 2001-2002 school year, 13 children with no\nNative Hawaiian ancestry were admitted to Kamehameha’s\npre-school program (two of the children declined admission);\nthe following school year 12 non-Native Hawaiian children\nwere admitted to the pre-school; and the year after that—the\n2003-2004 school year—16 students without Native Hawaiian\nancestry were admitted. And, in the summer of 2003, for\ninstance, non-Native Hawaiians were enrolled in several of\nthe enrichment programs run by the Kamehameha Schools: 6\nof 133 students in the Performing Arts Academy; 33 of 1,741\n\f19060            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nstudents in Explorations; 5 of 18 students in Culinary Arts;\nand 4 of 164 students in Hoolauna Keauhou.\n\n    3. Current Conditions in the Educational Status of\n    Native Hawaiians\n\n   Although the Kamehameha Schools are partly responsible\nfor the Native Hawaiian community’s ability to maintain “its\ndistinct character as an aboriginal, native people,” Native\nHawaiians, nonetheless, continue to face “economic depriva-\ntion, low educational attainment, poor health status, substan-\ndard housing and social dislocation.” From Mauka to Makai\nat 2. In particular, Native Hawaiians have traditionally per-\nformed much below national averages in the educational\narena.\n\n       In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Educa-\n    tion to submit to Congress a comprehensive report\n    on Native Hawaiian education. The report, entitled\n    the “Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Proj-\n    ect,” was released in 1983 and documented that\n    Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard to\n    national norms on standardized achievement tests,\n    were disproportionately represented in many nega-\n    tive social and physical statistics indicative of spe-\n    cial educational needs, and had educational needs\n    that were related to their unique cultural situation,\n    such as different learning styles and low self-image.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(14).\n\n   That trend continues today. In 2002, Congress recognized\nthat Native Hawaiians are severely disadvantaged in educa-\ntion. It found that:\n\n      (A) educational risk factors continue to start even\n    before birth from many Native Hawaiian children[;]\n    ...\n\f            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS              19061\n   (B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin\ntheir school experience lagging behind other students\nin terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test\nscores;\n\n  (C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score\nbelow national norms on standardized education\nachievement tests at all grade levels;\n\n   (D) both public and private schools continue to\nshow a pattern of lower percentages of Native\nHawaiian students in the uppermost achievement\nlevels and in gifted and talented programs;\n\n  (E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be over-\nrepresented among students qualifying for special\neducation programs provided to students with learn-\ning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional\nimpairment, and other such disabilities;\n\n  (F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepre-\nsented in institutions of higher education and among\nadults who have completed four or more years of\ncollege;\n\n   (G) Native Hawaiians continue to be dispropor-\ntionately represented in many negative social and\nphysical statistics indicative of special educational\nneeds[;] . . .\n\n. . . and\n\n   (H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 per-\ncent of the students served by the State of Hawaii\nDepartment of Education, and there are and will con-\ntinue to be geographically rural, isolated areas with\na high Native Hawaiian population density.\n\f19062               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(16)(A)-(H).\n\n   In addition, the most recent Native Hawaiian Educational\nAssessment, published in September 2005, concluded that,\n“[o]n the whole, . . . Native Hawaiian children in the public\nschool system perform poorly in school compared with their\nnon-Hawaiian peers.” Ka Huakai, 2005 Native Hawaiian\nEducational Assessment 229, available at http://ulukau.org/\nelib/cgi-bin/library?c=nhea&l=en (hereinafter “Ka Huakai”).\nThat most recent report found that 75% of public schools with\na predominantly Native Hawaiian student body did not meet\nthe state’s adequate yearly progress standards, but that num-\nber dropped to less than 58% for schools without a majority\nof Native Hawaiians, a difference of more than 17%. Id. at\n251. Also, Native Hawaiian students in elementary and sec-\nondary public schools ranked the lowest of all major ethnic\ngroups throughout the state in reading and math, falling\nbetween 9 and 15 percentiles behind the state average. Id. at\n261, 268. In addition, only 69.4% of Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents graduated from high school in 2002, compared to a state\naverage of 76.6% overall. Id. at 285.4\n\n  B.    Procedural History\n\n  Plaintiff applied for admission to the Kamehameha\nSchools. He has no Hawaiian ancestry. Although the school\n  4\n    Disparities abound outside of the educational context as well. Today\namong the major ethnic groups in Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have the\nhighest rates of unemployment, Ka Huakai at 84, and poverty, id. at 86-87,\nand the lowest mean family income, id. at 85-86. They live in the poorest\ngeographic areas and are underrepresented in managerial and professional\noccupations. Id. at 8. Native Hawaiians suffer from greater heath risks\nthan other ethnic groups on the islands, with the lowest life expectancy\nand highest mortality rates from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Id. at\n93. Although Native Hawaiians account for approximately 20% of the\nstate’s population, they account for more than half of all teenage pregnan-\ncies, id. at 203, and more than 44% of child abuse and neglect cases in the\nstate, id. at 206. Native Hawaiians are more likely to be arrested for vio-\nlent crimes than any other ethnic group in the state. Id. at 76-77.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19063\ndeemed him a “competitive applicant” and put him on the\nwaiting list, he was repeatedly denied admission. The Kame-\nhameha Schools concede that Plaintiff likely would have been\nadmitted had he possessed Hawaiian ancestry.\n\n  Plaintiff filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, challeng-\ning the Kamehameha Schools’ admissions policy. He sought\nboth damages and injunctive relief.5 The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the Kamehameha Schools,\nholding that the policy satisfied a variation of the standard\nused to evaluate affirmative action plans challenged under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000e–2000h-6:\n\n      The Court finds the plan has a legitimate justification\n      and serves a legitimate remedial purpose by address-\n      ing the socioeconomic and educational disadvan-\n      tages facing Native Hawaiians, producing Native\n      Hawaiian leadership for community involvement,\n      and revitalizing Native Hawaiian culture, thereby\n      remedying current manifest imbalances resulting\n      from the influx of western civilization.\n\nDoe v. Kamehameha Sch./Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, 295\nF. Supp. 2d 1141, 1172 (D. Haw. 2003). The district court\nalso held that application of § 1981 to the admissions policy\nshould be consistent with other congressional enactments\ninvolving Native Hawaiians. Id. at 1174. Plaintiff timely\nappealed.\n\n  The majority of a three-judge panel reversed the district\ncourt. Doe v. Kamehameha Sch./Bernice Pauahi Bishop\nEstate, 416 F.3d 1025, 1048 (9th Cir. 2005). The panel con-\n  5\n   Plaintiff now seeks only damages because he is no longer a high school\nstudent. This case is not moot, however, because if the Kamehameha\nSchools’ admissions policy were unlawful, Plaintiff has a possible claim\nfor money damages.\n\f19064               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ncluded that the Title VII framework applied, id. at 1038-39,\nbut the majority held that the Kamehameha Schools’ prefer-\nence policy violated § 1981 because it “operates as an abso-\nlute bar to admission for non-Hawaiians,” id. at 1041. We\nthen took the case en banc.6 Doe v.

For the rea-\nsons that we detail below, we agree with the Schools.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n  A.      History of § 1981, Runyon, and McDonald\n\n   [1] Title 42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides, in pertinent part, that\n“[a]ll persons . . . shall have the same right . . . to make and\nenforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” The\ngenesis of the current statute was the Civil Rights Act of\n1866, ch. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27 (hereinafter “1866 Act”), which\nCongress enacted pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment.7\nUnder its authority to enact laws to abolish the “badges and\nincidents of slavery,” United States v. Stanley (Civil Rights\nCases), 109 U.S. 3, 20 (1883), Congress intended for the 1866\nAct to counter the explicit discrimination faced by the\nrecently freed slaves. See Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n v.\n  7\n   Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 provided:\n      That all persons born in the United States and not subject to any\n      foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared\n      to be citizens of the United States; and such citizens, of every\n      race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slav-\n      ery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime\n      whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall have the\n      same right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to\n      make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence,\n      to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and per-\n      sonal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and pro-\n      ceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by\n      white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and\n      penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regula-\n      tion, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.\n14 Stat. at 27.\n\f19066                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nPennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 386-88 (1982) (“Congress\ninstead acted to protect the freedmen from intentional dis-\ncrimination by those whose object was to make their former\nslaves dependent serfs, victims of unjust laws, and debarred\nfrom all progress and elevation by organized social preju-\ndices.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   After the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress\nreenacted, with minor changes, the text of the 1866 Act in\nsection 16 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, ch. 114, § 16, 16\nStat. 140 (hereinafter “1870 Act”).8 See Runyon v. McCrary,\n427 U.S. 160, 169 n.8 (1976) (describing the history of\n§ 1981 and noting that section 16 of the 1870 Act was\n“merely a re-enactment,” with some small changes, of the\n1866 Act). Accordingly, § 1981 has “roots” in both the Thir-\nteenth and the Fourteenth Amendments. Gen. Bldg. Contrac-\ntors, 458 U.S. at 390 n.17. But the “events and passions of the\ntime in which the law was forged” make clear that the pur-\npose of § 1981 was to destroy the societal influences that\nwere intended to keep former slaves from achieving parity\nwith former masters. Id. at 386 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n  Section 1981 largely lay dormant for nearly a century\nwhen, in 1976, the Supreme Court reinvigorated the statute in\nRunyon. In Runyon, the Supreme Court faced the question\n  8\n   In pertinent part, section 16 of the Enforcement Act of 1870 provides:\n         And it be further enacted, That all persons within the jurisdic-\n      tion of the United States shall have the same right in every State\n      and Territory in the United States to make and enforce contracts,\n      to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit\n      of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and prop-\n      erty as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\n      punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of\n      every kind, and none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regula-\n      tion, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\n16 Stat. at 144.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19067\nwhether § 1981 prevents “private, commercially operated,\nnonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective\nstudents because they are Negroes,” 427 U.S. at 168, and held\nthat it does, id. at 172-73.9 The parents of African-American\nchildren had sought to enter into contractual relationships\nwith the schools. “Under those contractual relationships, the\nschools would have received payments for services rendered,\nand the prospective students would have received instruction\nin return for those payments.” Id. at 172. The schools’ refusal\nto admit them therefore “amount[ed] to a classic violation of\n§ 1981.” Id. The Court noted that Congress had the right to\nreach private acts of discrimination in the private school set-\nting because of its power under the Thirteenth Amendment to\nenact legislation to combat racial discrimination. Id. at 170-\n71. Runyon, then, involved a straightforward case of discrimi-\nnation, not a remedial policy.\n\n   [2] On the same day as it issued Runyon, the Court decided\nthat § 1981, notwithstanding its text, prohibits discrimination\nagainst white people, as well as against non-whites. McDon-\nald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 296 (1976).\n\n   [3] In neither case did the Court have occasion to consider\nwhether and under what terms (i.e., under what standard of\nscrutiny) a private remedial racial preference would be per-\nmissible in the educational context under § 1981, nor has it\nsince. But in considering the reach of § 1981, the Supreme\n  9\n    The Kamehameha Schools are non-profit, rather than commercial. But,\nbecause the schools charge tuition (albeit at a rate that represents only a\nfraction of the cost to educate students), the bargained-for exchange of\npayments for instruction exists here, as it did in Runyon. We need not and\ndo not decide whether § 1981 would apply if the Schools charged no\ntuition at all, but simply donated education to Native Hawaiian students.\n  In addition, for the purposes of our decision, we accept that “Native\nHawaiian\"—like “Negro\"—is a racial classification. See Rice v. Cayetano,\n528 U.S. 495, 514 (2000) (so holding in the context of a voting rights\ncase).\n\f19068            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nCourt has looked, in different ways, to both the Fourteenth\nAmendment and Title VII for guidance.\n\n  B.    Application of Title VII Standards to § 1981 Claims\n\n   [4] In General Building Contractors, the Court limited\n§ 1981 to cover only acts involving intentional discrimination,\nexcluding from the statute’s reach actions that merely have a\ndisparate effect. 458 U.S. at 391. In so doing, the Court relied\non the fact that § 1981 traces its history, in part, to the Four-\nteenth Amendment and, accordingly, to the Equal Protection\nClause. Id. at 390-91. Even though the Supreme Court\nimported the purposeful discrimination element of its equal\nprotection jurisprudence to § 1981, later Supreme Court pre-\ncedent regarding § 1981 and Title VII suggests that the “strict\nscrutiny” standard of equal protection does not apply to a\nwholly private school’s race-based remedial admissions plan.\n\n   In Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 186\n(1989), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in\nEstate of Reynolds v. Martin, 985 F.2d 470, 475 n.2 (9th Cir.\n1993), the Supreme Court signaled its intention to apply the\nTitle VII analysis to § 1981 claims brought against a private\nemployer. In Patterson, the plaintiff brought a § 1981 suit\nagainst her former employer, alleging that the employer had\nharassed her, failed to promote her, and fired her on account\nof her race. 491 U.S. at 169. The Court analyzed the ways in\nwhich § 1981 and Title VII overlap, as well as the statutes’\ndifferences, and concluded that the Title VII burden-shifting\nsystem of proof established in Texas Department of Commu-\nnity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981), and\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802\n(1973), applied to the case at hand. Patterson, 491 U.S. at\n186. That is, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie\ncase of discrimination by coming forward with evidence that\nan employer considered race in its employment decisions. Id.;\nJohnson v. Transp. Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 626 (1987). After\na prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19069\nemployer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason\nfor the decision. Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187. “The existence\nof an affirmative action plan provides such a rationale.” John-\nson, 480 U.S. at 626. If a relevant affirmative action plan\nexists, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that\nthe justification provided was pretextual and that the plan is\ninvalid. Id.\n\n   Several courts expressly have applied Title VII’s substan-\ntive standards when examining § 1981 challenges to private\naffirmative action plans. The leading case, on which all the\nothers rely, is Setser v. Novack Investment Co., 657 F.2d 962\n(8th Cir. 1981) (en banc). In Setser, the plaintiff, a white man,\nsued Novack under § 1981 claiming that he had been refused\nemployment on account of his race because of an affirmative\naction plan. Setser v. Novack Inv. Co., 638 F.2d 1137, 1139\n& n.3 (8th Cir. 1981), opinion vacated in part on reh’g by\nSetser, 657 F.2d at 962. The Setser court addressed two issues\nthat are relevant here: “(1) whether section 1981 prohibits all\nrace-conscious affirmative action; [and] (2) whether the stan-\ndards for reviewing affirmative action under [T]itle VII gov-\nern the review of such plans under section 1981.” 657 F.2d at\n965.\n\n   The Eighth Circuit first concluded that § 1981 does not bar\naffirmative action programs, even in light of McDonald, 427\nU.S. at 296, which held that § 1981 affords protection to\nwhite people. In so holding, the Setser court looked to the\nSupreme Court’s decision in United Steelworkers of Am. v.\nWeber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), which held that Title VII does\nnot bar all preferential treatment on the basis of race, and\napplied the same rationale to § 1981:\n\n    It would indeed be . . . ironic if the Civil Rights Act\n    of 1866 was used now to prohibit the only effective\n    remedy for past discriminatory employment prac-\n    tices against blacks and other minorities, when the\n    Act was virtually useless to prevent the occurrence\n\f19070            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n    of such discrimination for more than a century . . . .\n    We conclude that the Supreme Court, by approving\n    race-conscious affirmative action by employers in\n    Weber, implicitly approved the use of race-conscious\n    plans to remedy past discrimination under section\n    1981. To open the door for such plans under [T]itle\n    VII and close it under section 1981 would make little\n    sense. The prohibition under section 1981 of affir-\n    mative action plans permissible under [T]itle VII\n    would bar a remedy Congress left within the discre-\n    tion of private employers when it passed [T]itle VII.\n\nSetser, 657 F.2d at 966-67 (emphasis added).\n\n   Having determined that affirmative action plans were per-\nmissible, the Setser court expressly “equat[ed] the affirmative\naction standards of [T]itle VII with those of section 1981.” Id.\nat 967. The court did so in view of the general principle that,\n“[i]n fashioning a substantive body of law under section 1981\nthe courts should, in an effort to avoid undesirable substantive\nlaw conflicts, look to ethe principles of law created under\n[T]itle VII for direction.” Id. (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). This principle of consistency was especially important to\nthe Setser court because it found untenable the prospect that\nan employer could be ordered, under Title VII, to implement\nan affirmative action plan, but simultaneously barred from\nimplementing that same plan under § 1981, if the two statutes\nwere interpreted differently. Id. at 967-68.\n\n   The Third Circuit in a recent decision, as well as other\ncourts, have followed Setser in using Title VII standards to\nevaluate private affirmative action plans challenged under\n§ 1981. See, e.g., Schurr v. Resorts Int’l Hotel, Inc., 196 F.3d\n486, 498-99 (3d Cir. 1999); Edmonson v. U.S. Steel Corp.,\n659 F.2d 582, 584 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam); Frost v.\nChrysler Motor Corp., 826 F. Supp. 1290, 1294 (W.D. Okla.\n1993); Stock v. Universal Foods Corp., 817 F. Supp. 1300,\n1306 (D. Md. 1993); see also Johnson v. Transp. Agency, 770\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19071\nF.2d 752, 755 n.2 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting, with approval, the\nSetser analysis), aff’d, 480 U.S. 616 (1987).\n\n   The Supreme Court’s recent University of Michigan cases\n—Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), and Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003)—do not counsel a different\nresult. In those cases, the Supreme Court strictly scrutinized\nthe admissions policies of a public university, the University\nof Michigan Law School and its undergraduate counterpart.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326 (law school); Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n270 (undergraduate institution). Plaintiff places great stock in\nthe fact that in both cases, the Supreme Court mentioned\n§ 1981 in conjunction with the plaintiff’s Equal Protection\nClause claim. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (noting that,\nbecause the law school’s admissions policy satisfied strict\nscrutiny review under the Equal Protection Clause, it also sat-\nisfied § 1981); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 275-76 & n.23 (noting that,\nbecause the university’s undergraduate admissions program\nfailed strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, it also\nviolated § 1981).\n\n   To support both of its holdings, the Court cited General\nBuilding Contractors for the proposition that discrimination\nthat violates the Equal Protection Clause also violates § 1981.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (noting that “the prohibition\nagainst discrimination in § 1981 is co-extensive with the\nEqual Protection Clause”); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23\n(“[P]urposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will also violate\n§ 1981.”). As explained earlier, in General Building Contrac-\ntors, the Court held that § 1981, like the Equal Protection\nClause, prohibits only purposeful discrimination and therefore\ndoes not permit claims of disparate impact. 458 U.S. at 389.\nRead in context, we believe that the Supreme Court’s citation\nto General Building Contractors in the University of Michi-\ngan cases was meant to signal only the fact that both § 1981\nand the Fourteenth Amendment require intentional discrimi-\nnation. Whether strict scrutiny applies to § 1981 claims was\n\f19072             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nnot at issue. In Grutter and Gratz, cases involving state\naction, the schools perforce did not argue that their programs\nsatisfied § 1981. The Court in Grutter and Gratz simply did\nnot consider the question.\n\n   [5] In view of the precedents that we have just discussed,\nwe conclude that Title VII principles apply here. Defendant\nis a purely private entity that receives no federal funds. The\nSupreme Court has never applied strict scrutiny to the actions\nof a purely private entity. The question remains how best to\nadapt the Title VII employment framework to an educational\ncontext and to the unique historical circumstances of this case.\n\n  C. Applying a Modified Title VII Standard in the\n  Educational Context Under § 1981\n\n   Only step three of the traditional three-stage Title VII anal-\nysis, Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, is\nat issue here. At step one, Plaintiff established a prima facie\ncase by showing (as the Schools concede) that the Kameha-\nmeha Schools consider applicants’ Hawaiian ancestry, or lack\nthereof, in making admissions decisions. At step two, the\nKamehameha Schools have specified their remedial admis-\nsions policy as the non-discriminatory rationale for their deci-\nsions. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626 (holding that an\naffirmative action plan provides a legitimate reason for a hir-\ning decision that considers race or ethnicity). The validity of\nthis policy is the focus of the parties’ attentions in this case.\nThat is, at step three, Plaintiff asserts that the Schools’ “justi-\nfication is pretextual and the [admissions] plan is invalid.” Id.\nThe burden of proof at this step lies with Plaintiff. Id. at 627.\n\n  The Supreme Court has outlined the appropriate step-three\nTitle VII inquiry in the context of private employment. In\nWeber, the Court held for the first time that Title VII does not\nprevent private employers from implementing voluntary,\nremedial affirmative action plans. 443 U.S. at 208. Weber\ninvolved an employer that had established a training program\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19073\nand reserved 50% of the program’s openings for black\nemployees until the percentage of black workers in its plant\nreached the percentage of black workers in the local labor\nforce. Id. at 197. In concluding that the plan was permissible\nunder Title VII, the Court noted that the plan did not “unnec-\nessarily trammel the interests of the white employees” or\n“create an absolute bar to the[ir] advancement.” Id. at 208.\nThe Court based its decision in part on the fact that the plan\nwas a “temporary measure\": “Preferential selection . . . will\nend as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in\nthe Gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in\nthe local labor force.” Id. at 208-09. The Court declined to\n“define in detail the line of demarcation between permissible\nand impermissible affirmative action plans.” Id. at 208; see\nalso Johnson, 770 F.2d at 757 (noting that the Supreme Court\nhad not “establish[ed] a rigid formula for testing the validity\nof an affirmative action plan”), aff’d, 480 U.S. at 641.\n\n   [6] Eight years later, in Johnson, the Court concluded that\na county-agency employer did not violate Title VII by taking\ninto consideration the sex of a female employee in deciding\nto promote her instead of a male employee. The promotional\npolicy, which took into consideration the sex and race of an\napplicant, was valid because it attempted to eliminate a “man-\nifest imbalance” in a “traditionally segregated job categor[y].”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 631 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nLike Weber, Johnson also considered whether the plan unnec-\nessarily trammeled the rights of the non-preferred class, in\nthis case men, or created an absolute bar to their advance-\nment. Id. at 637-38. Finally, the Court considered whether the\nplan was “temporary,” designed to “attain a balanced work\nforce, not to maintain one.” Id. at 639-40.\n\n  [7] We recently distilled the Court’s analysis this way: pri-\nvate employers’ affirmative action plans (1) must respond to\na manifest imbalance in the work force; (2) must not “unnec-\nessarily trammel[ ]” the rights of members of the non-\npreferred class or “create an absolute bar to their advance-\n\f19074            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nment\"; and (3) must do no more than is necessary to attain a\nbalance. Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 F.3d 506, 520-21 (9th Cir.\n2002). In Rudebusch, we found that the pay equity plan at\nissue was “not wholly analogous” to the hiring and promo-\ntional plans at issue in Weber and Johnson because of “some\nsignificant conceptual differences” between the types of\nplans. Id. at 520. We nevertheless applied the three Johnson\nfactors, taking account of “the context of our case.” Id. at 521.\nSimilarly, we hold today that the Johnson factors, modified to\nfit “the context of our case,” provide the appropriate frame-\nwork for determining whether a wholly private K-12 educa-\ntional institution’s remedial admissions policy is valid.\n\n   We note that, when assessing the validity of affirmative\naction plans, the Supreme Court has consistently recognized\nthe importance of deferring to the judgment and expertise of\nthe relevant decisionmakers. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328\n(deferring to education officials in admissions decisions);\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 206 (giving deference to employers in hir-\ning decisions). In the employment context, the Supreme Court\nheld that, in enacting Title VII, Congress wished to preserve,\nto the maximum extent possible, the freedom and discretion\ntraditionally afforded to private businesses. Weber, 443 U.S.\nat 206-07. In the educational context, the Court has under-\nscored that “complex educational judgments” should be left\nlargely to schools. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328; see also Regents\nof Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226 n.12 (1985)\n(noting that “[a]cademic freedom thrives . . . on autonomous\ndecisionmaking by the academy itself” (citations omitted)).\nThe importance of “educational autonomy\"—at least in the\npost-secondary environment—is rooted in the First Amend-\nment. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329 (“[G]iven . . . the expan-\nsive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the\nuniversity environment, universities occupy a special niche in\nour constitutional tradition.”); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 312 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.)\n(“Academic freedom . . . long has been viewed as a special\nconcern of the First Amendment.”). Consequently, we must\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19075\naccord deference to private educational decisionmakers just as\nwe do to private business decisionmakers and public educa-\ntional decisionmakers.\n\n   More importantly, schools perform a significantly broader\nfunction than do employers. The Supreme Court has long rec-\nognized that schools do more than simply teach our Nation’s\nchildren the three “R’s.” Schools play a special role in the\ndevelopment of young citizens. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331\n(“We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding impor-\ntance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describ-\ning education as pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural\nheritage with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of\nsociety.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Brown v. Bd. of\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954) (“[E]ducation . . . is the very\nfoundation of good citizenship.”). Educational opportunity is\ncrucial to the development of tomorrow’s leaders. See Grut-\nter, 539 U.S. at 332 (“In order to cultivate a set of leaders\nwith legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that\nthe path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified\nindividuals of every race and ethnicity.”).\n\n   Primary and secondary school education is the gateway to\nhigher education and is of paramount importance for the train-\ning of our nation’s workforce. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.\n202, 221 (1982) (“[E]ducation provides the basic tools by\nwhich individuals might lead economically productive lives to\nthe benefit of us all.”); City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Net-\nwork, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 437 (1993) (Blackmun, J., concur-\nring) (“Our cases have consistently recognized the importance\nof education to the professional and personal development of\nthe individual.”). Perhaps more relevant here, increased pri-\nmary and secondary school educational achievement by\nminority groups can obviate the downstream need for affirma-\ntive action programs by employers and institutions of higher\nlearning. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 635 (noting that very lim-\nited numbers of women and minorities possess the “special-\nized training and experience” required for many categories of\n\f19076            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\njobs); Grutter, 539 U.S. at 346 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)\n(noting that the need for affirmative action programs in higher\neducation will decrease “[a]s lower school education in\nminority communities improves”).\n\n   In sum, schools educate students for their future endeavors\nin society as a whole. While private employers strive primar-\nily to make money, and public employers (such as police and\nfire departments) perform a specific public function, schools\npursue a much broader mission: the development of all chil-\ndren to become citizens, leaders, and workers.\n\n   [8] The Title VII cases, in the employment context, recog-\nnize the laudable goal of achieving diversity and proportional\nrepresentation in the workplace; this goal necessarily focuses\ninternally and is limited to the “employer’s work force.”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 632. By contrast, ensuring that signifi-\ncantly underachieving minority groups are included fully as\ntomorrow’s citizens, leaders, and workers necessarily focuses\nexternally. Considering this important difference, we con-\nclude that we should use a standard for evaluating remedial\nracial preferences by wholly private primary and secondary\nschools that is akin to that used in Title VII employment\ncases, but that takes into account the inherently broad and\nsocietal focus of the educational endeavor.\n\n   [9] Adjusting the first Johnson factor to account for this\nexternal focus, we hold that, to justify a remedial racial pref-\nerence, a private school must demonstrate that specific, signif-\nicant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect\nthe target population. The external focus of the educational\nmission renders unnecessary the requirement of proof of a\n“manifest imbalance” within a particular school; the relevant\npopulation is the community as a whole. At the same time, the\nstrict focus on present, demonstrable disparities in educational\nachievement limits the types of permissible programs and dis-\ntinguishes a more amorphous program that relies solely on\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19077\ngeneral past societal discrimination. See City of Richmond v.\nJ.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 505-06 (1989).\n\n   [10] Relatedly, the second Johnson factor must be modified\nto account for the relevant scope of inquiry. Just as imbalance\nshould be viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a\nsingle school, so should the respective rights of members of\nthe non-preferred group. Therefore, within the community as\na whole, an admissions policy must not “unnecessarily tram-\nmel” the rights of students in the non-preferred class or\n“create an absolute bar” to their advancement. The third John-\nson factor is similarly modified: an admissions policy must do\nno more than is necessary to remedy the imbalance in the\ncommunity as a whole, that we identified at the first step.\nThese three factors best harmonize the relevant statutes and\nSupreme Court cases.\n\n   Judge Bybee’s reliance on Runyon in attacking our conclu-\nsion is particularly misplaced. As his dissent quotes several\ntimes, diss. at 19105, 19106, 19110, the Supreme Court in\nRunyon held that private primary schools in Virginia that cat-\negorically denied admission to African-American applicants\nrepresented a “classic violation of § 1981.” Runyon, 427 U.S.\nat 172. Nothing in the modified Johnson framework that we\nadopt today, or indeed anywhere in this opinion, is to the con-\ntrary. Quite simply, Runyon is inapposite: The program at\nissue in Runyon would certainly fail the first step of our anal-\nysis because specific, significant imbalances did not exist\nfavoring African-Americans. To the contrary, specific, signif-\nicant imbalances did exist disfavoring African-Americans.\nThe Civil Rights Act was passed specifically with the plight\nof African-Americans in mind. It is therefore unsurprising\nthat the Court labeled a whites-only admissions policy a\n“classic violation of § 1981.”\n\n   By contrast, the very nature of affirmative action plans is\nthat historically disfavored and underachieving minorities\nmay be given preferential treatment in certain narrowly\n\f19078            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ndefined, limited programs. It is the contours of such a\nprogram—a private school’s voluntary remedial admissions\nprogram—that we explore today. We turn now to applying the\nthree modified Johnson factors to the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy.\n\n    1.   Respond to a Manifest Imbalance\n\n   [11] To meet the first modified Johnson factor, a private\nschool must demonstrate that, in the relevant community, spe-\ncific, significant imbalances in educational achievement pres-\nently affect the group favored by its admissions policy. The\nrelevant community in this case is the state of Hawaii,\nbecause the Schools serve students from all of Hawaii’s\nislands. We therefore consider whether a manifest imbalance\nin current educational achievement exists between Native\nHawaiians and other ethnic groups in Hawaii.\n\n   Native Hawaiian students are systemically disadvantaged in\nthe classroom. As we described earlier, there is a substantial\ndisparity in performance between Native Hawaiian students\nand other ethnic groups. Briefly, Native Hawaiian students\nscore lower on standardized tests than all other ethnic groups\nin the state, Ka Huakai at 229, 261, are more likely to be in\nspecial education classes, id. at 278, are more likely to be\nabsent from school, id. at 229, and are more likely to attend\npoor-quality schools, id. at 252. Native Hawaiians are the\nleast likely of the state’s major ethnic groups to graduate from\nhigh school, id. at 229, 285, and they are less likely than their\nnon-Hawaiian counterparts to attend college, id. at 118-19.\nCongress has expressly recognized the educational disadvan-\ntages suffered by Native Hawaiians and their marginalized\nstatus. 20 U.S.C. § 7512.\n\n   In view of those facts and congressional findings, it is clear\nthat a manifest imbalance exists in the K-12 educational arena\nin the state of Hawaii, with Native Hawaiians falling at the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19079\nbottom of the spectrum in almost all areas of educational\nprogress and success.\n\n   Furthermore, it is precisely this manifest imbalance that the\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy seeks to address.\nThe goal is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educa-\ntional parity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii. The stated\npurpose of Kamehameha Schools is to create educational\nopportunities to improve the capability and well-being of\nNative Hawaiians and to cultivate, nurture, and perpetuate\nHawaiian culture, values, history, and language.\n\n   To that end, the Schools advance a curriculum specially tai-\nlored to students of Native Hawaiian descent. The Schools\nhave pinpointed areas in which Native Hawaiians, in particu-\nlar, are severely disadvantaged and have developed a curricu-\nlum to attend to those needs. The Schools have instituted a\n“Leadership Model” of education, meant to “restore self-\nidentity, integrate Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, lan-\nguage, and traditions into the educational process, and provide\na first-rate educational experience for Native Hawaiians.” The\nSchools’ efforts are aimed at increasing scores on standard-\nized tests, increasing the number of Native Hawaiians attend-\ning colleges and graduate schools, improving Native\nHawaiian representation in professional, academic, and mana-\ngerial positions, and developing community leaders who are\ncommitted to improving the lives of all Native Hawaiians.\n\n   In addition, the Kamehameha Schools recognized, early on,\na critical need to help perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture. As\na result, in the 1940s, the Schools instituted a formal Hawai-\nian Cultural Program that continues today. Courses on Hawai-\nian history and culture are required before a student may\ngraduate.\n\n   [12] The Kamehameha Schools have shown that specific,\nsignificant imbalances in educational achievement currently\naffect Native Hawaiians in Hawaii and that the Schools aim\n\f19080               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nto remedy that imbalance. Accordingly, they have satisfied\nthe “manifest imbalance” criterion.\n\n       2.   Do Not Unnecessarily Trammel the Rights of\n       Members of the Non-Preferred Class or Create an\n       Absolute Bar to Their Advancement\n\n   Under the second prong of the modified Title VII analysis,\nwe ask whether, within the relevant community of Hawaii, the\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy unnecessarily tram-\nmels the rights of members of the non-preferred class, that is,\nstudents with no Hawaiian ancestry, or creates an absolute bar\nto their advancement.\n\n  The Kamehameha Schools allow all students to apply for\nadmission. But once the applications are received, the Schools\nconsider the ethnic background of the students and admit\nqualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before\nadmitting children with no such ancestry. Because the pool of\nqualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood\ngreatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-\nNative Hawaiians generally are not admitted.10 For the rea-\nsons that follow, however, the Schools’ admissions policy\ndoes not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native\nHawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\n   [13] We begin by noting that nothing in the record suggests\nthat educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for stu-\ndents, like Plaintiff, who lack any Native Hawaiian ancestry.\nTo the contrary, the same statistical data that portray the diffi-\nculties of Native Hawaiian children generally portray much\ngreater educational achievement, in both public and private\n  10\n    One student without Native Hawaiian ancestry has been admitted to\nthe Schools in recent years because, for one class, the available seats out-\nnumbered the applicants with Native Hawaiian ancestry. See Timothy\nHurley & Walker Wright, Kamehameha Schools admits non-Hawaiian,\nHonolulu Advertiser, July 12, 2002.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19081\nprimary and secondary schools, for children of all other racial\nand ethnic groups in Hawaii. Those students denied admission\nby Kamehameha Schools have ample and adequate alternative\neducational options. The well-documented ability of non-\nNative Hawaiians to attain educational achievement in Hawaii\nnotwithstanding the Kamehameha Schools’ longstanding\nadmissions policy demonstrates that the policy neither unnec-\nessarily trammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor\nabsolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.\n\n   Our inquiry does not stop there, however. The history of\nNative Hawaiians and of the Kamehameha Schools has cer-\ntain unique features that Congress has acknowledged. In\n1993, Congress admitted that the United States was responsi-\nble, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy.\n1993 Apology Resolution, 107 Stat. 1510. Later, when it\nenacted education-related legislation in 1994, and then reen-\nacted that legislation in 2002, Congress made findings regard-\ning the disadvantages faced by Native Hawaiian students in\nthe public school system in Hawaii. 20 U.S.C. §§ 7901-7941,\n7512(16). As part of the 2002 reenactment, a congressional\ncommittee even urged the Bishop Trust, which operates the\nKamehameha Schools, to “redouble its efforts to educate\nNative Hawaiian children.” H.R. Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333\n(2001) (emphasis added).\n\n   Congressional recognition of the challenges faced by\nNative Hawaiians in the educational arena supports our con-\nclusion that the Schools’ policy does not unnecessarily tram-\nmel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians. To the contrary, as\nCongress has recognized, in the unique context of Native\nHawaiian history, affirmative measures are needed to address\npresent, severe inequalities in educational achievement.\n\n  Finally, we examine the expectations of those who lack\nNative Hawaiian ancestry. The Supreme Court observed in\nJohnson that “the denial of the promotion [at issue] unsettled\nno legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the part of peti-\n\f19082            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntioner.” 480 U.S. at 638. Similarly, here, we must ask whether\nPlaintiff had a legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admis-\nsion to the Schools. The answer is “no.”\n\n   No applicant to the Kamehameha Schools is guaranteed\nadmission. Just as the applicant in Johnson “had no absolute\nentitlement” to the promotion from his employer, Plaintiff\nhere likewise “had no absolute entitlement” to admission to\nthe Schools. Id.\n\n   Furthermore, the Kamehameha Schools were established\nwhen Hawaii was a sovereign nation, and they were built on\nthe Hawaiian monarchy’s land. When the Schools began, a\nnon-Native Hawaiian had no expectation of admission to the\nSchools, except when Native Hawaiians failed to fill all the\navailable slots, or until Native Hawaiians achieved educa-\ntional parity with others. See supra p. 19058. In the interven-\ning 118 years, the Schools’ admissions policy, and therefore\nthe expectations of the non-Native Hawaiians, has remained\nconstant. Thus, denial of Plaintiff’s application for admission\n“unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation.” Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 638.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights\nof non-Native Hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their\nadvancement.\n\n    3.   Do No More than Is Necessary\n\n   Finally, the Schools’ admissions policy must do no more\nthan is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered\nby students of Native Hawaiian ancestry. This factor requires\nthat an affirmative action plan be “temporary.” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 640; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208.\n\n   The Kamehameha Schools’ decision to give preference to\nstudents with Native Hawaiian ancestry is limited in duration\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19083\nin two distinct ways. First, if qualified students with Native\nHawaiian ancestry do not apply to the Schools in sufficient\nnumbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent\nyear, see supra note 10, the Schools’ policy is to open admis-\nsions to any qualified candidate. Second, preference will be\ngiven to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry only for so\nlong as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects\nof past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and\nof social and economic deprivation. These dual aspects of the\nKamehameha Schools’ policy constitute an “[e]xpress assur-\nance that a program is only temporary.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n639-40. An explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has\nnever been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid.\nSee, e.g., id. at 639 (finding the lack of an “explicit end date”\n\"unsurprising” and upholding an employer’s affirmative\naction plan even though “only gradual” improvements were\nanticipated); see also Grutter 539 U.S. at 343 (adopting Jus-\ntice Powell’s reasoning in the 25-year-old Bakke decision,\nwhich upheld affirmative action programs in higher educa-\ntion, and expecting that in 25 more years, these programs\n“will no longer be necessary\"—a span of 50 years).\n\n   [14] Because the admissions policy is not fixed, but\nchanges as the capacity of the Schools’ programs increases\nand as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian community\nrises, the policy does no more than is necessary in light of the\nsignificant educational imbalances that Native Hawaiians con-\ntinue to face.\n\n   [15] Accordingly, the Kamehameha Schools’ admissions\npolicy satisfies the three Johnson criteria—offset a manifest\nimbalance, do not unnecessarily trammel others’ rights or\ncreate an absolute bar, and do no more than is necessary—as\nmodified for the private primary and secondary school con-\ntext. The Schools have shown that the admissions policy,\nfavoring students of Native Hawaiian descent, is legitimate\nand valid.\n\f19084            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   Judge Bybee’s dissent contends that we should hew more\nclosely to a traditional Title VII analysis and that, under such\nan analysis, the Schools’ preferential admissions policy is not\nvalid. (Bybee, J., diss. at 19104-52.) For the reasons that we\nhave detailed, we believe that the dissent’s focus is too nar-\nrow for the private school context and that Kamehameha\nSchools’ remedial admissions policy is legitimate in the face\nof the serious and systemic disadvantages faced by Native\nHawaiian students in Hawaii today. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n640 (“In evaluating the compliance of an affirmative action\nplan with Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination, we must\nbe mindful of this Court’s and Congress’ consistent emphasis\non the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of\nthe law.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Rude-\nbusch, 313 F.3d at 522-24 (revising the third Johnson factor\nto analyze quantitative rather than temporal limitations\nbecause of the context).\n\n   Even if we were to try to shove a square peg into a round\nhole by strictly applying the test developed in employment\ncases to the Kamehameha Schools’ admissions policy, that\npolicy would still be valid. As the Supreme Court has cau-\ntioned, “[i]t is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the\nletter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not\nwithin its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.” Weber,\n443 U.S. at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy holds true to the\nspirit of § 1981 by supporting Native Hawaiian students so\nthat they may attain parity with their non-Native Hawaiian\npeers. See Gen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 386.\n\n  D. Alternatively, and in Addition, Congress Specifically\n  Intended to Allow the Kamehameha Schools to Operate\n  When, in 1991, It Re-enacted § 1981.\n\n   Plaintiff brought suit under § 1981. He has brought no con-\nstitutional claims. Thus, we are charged only with determin-\ning Congress’ intent.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19085\n   Congress originally enacted what later became 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981 in 1870. At that time, the statute did not apply in\nHawaii because it was an independent, sovereign kingdom.\nCongress could not have had any conscious intention as to\nhow the statute would apply in Hawaii, because it did not\napply at all. When Hawaii became a territory in 1898, § 1981\napplied, as it continued to do when Hawaii became a state in\n1959, see Hawaiian Statehood Act, Pub. L. No. 86-3, § 15, 73\nStat. 4.11 (1959), but it was not until 1991 that Congress\nagain addressed and amended § 1981, see Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 101, 105 Stat. 1071. The 1991\namendments are the most recent, and indeed the only, time\nsince Hawaii became a territory that Congress has reenacted\n§ 1981.\n\n   Therefore, we must determine what Congress intended,\nwith regard to Native Hawaiians, when it reenacted § 1981 in\n1991. Because “[w]e assume that Congress is aware of exist-\ning law when it passes legislation,” Miles v. Apex Marine\nCorp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990), we must consider Congress’\nlong history of providing for Native Hawaiians through legis-\nlation. See Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.S. 174,\n184-85 (1988) (noting that courts “generally presume that\nCongress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the\nlegislation it enacts”). By construing § 1981 in the context of\npast congressional action that recognizes and provides for\nNative Hawaiians, we preserve the “sense and purpose” of all\nrelevant statutes. See Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 267\n(1981) (noting that it is the duty of the courts to give effect\nto differing and conflicting statutes so as to preserve their\n“sense and purpose”). Importantly, the Supreme Court has\nexpressly considered contemporaneous legislation when inter-\npreting the scope of § 1981. In Runyon, for instance, the Court\nrelied on Congress’ enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nand other civil rights legislation in concluding that Congress\nmust have intended § 1981 to reach private acts of discrimina-\ntion. 427 U.S. at 174; see also Weber, 443 U.S. at 201 (noting\nthat the application of Title VII to remedial affirmative action\n\f19086            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nplans must be read in light of its legislative history and “the\nhistorical context from which the Act arose”).\n\n   Accordingly, we look to legislation that Congress has\npassed specifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before\nand after 1991. As we have explained, we consider the pre-\n1991 statutory landscape because it informs us about what\nCongress had in mind when it reenacted § 1981. We consider\nthe post-1991 statutes to the extent that they demonstrate\nCongress’ own understanding of § 1981. That is, we presume\nthat Congress acts consistently with the extant body of law;\nstatutes enacted after 1991, therefore, must be read consis-\ntently with the revised version of § 1981. See Cannon v. Univ.\nof Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 696-97 (1979) (concluding that elected\nofficials are presumed to know the law, and that statutes\nshould be read consistently with each other).\n\n  Beginning as early as 1920, Congress recognized that a\nspecial relationship existed between the United States and\nHawaii. See Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, 42 Stat.\n108 (1921) (designating approximately 200,000 acres of\nceded public lands to Native Hawaiians for homesteading).\nOver the years, Congress has reaffirmed the unique relation-\nship that the United States has with Hawaii, as a result of the\nAmerican involvement in the overthrow of the Hawaiian\nmonarchy. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 7512(12), (13) (Native\nHawaiian Education Act, 2002); 42 U.S.C. § 11701(13), (14),\n(19), (20) (Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988).\n\n   Congress has relied on the special relationship that the\nUnited States has with Native Hawaiians to provide specifi-\ncally for their welfare in a number of different contexts. For\nexample, in 1987, Congress amended the Native American\nPrograms Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 100-175, § 506, 101 Stat.\n926 (1987), to provide federal funds for a state agency or\n“community-based Native Hawaiian organization” to “make\nloans to Native Hawaiian organizations and to individual\nNative Hawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19087\ndevelopment in the state of Hawaii.” A year later, Congress\nenacted the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, Pub.\nL. No. 100-579, § 11703(a), 102 Stat. 2916 (1988), “for the\npurpose of providing comprehensive health promotion and\ndisease prevention services as well as primary health services\nto Native Hawaiians.”\n\n   Most importantly for our purposes today, Congress also has\nfocused its attention on the educational disparities faced by\nNative Hawaiian students. In 1988, just three years before\nreenacting § 1981, Congress passed the Augustus F. Hawkins-\nRobert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School\nImprovement Amendments of 1988. 20 U.S.C. §§ 4901-4909\n(1988) (repealed 1994) (hereinafter “Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments”). Congress made extensive findings, similar to\nthe findings that it later made in 2002, see supra pp. 19060-\n61, about the educational needs of Native Hawaiians and rec-\nognized the necessity for “special efforts in education recog-\nnizing the unique cultural and historical circumstances of\nNative Hawaiians.” 20 U.S.C. § 4901(9) (1988) (repealed\n1994). For instance, Congress concluded that it has the power\nto “specially legislate for the benefit of Native Hawaiians,”\nencouraged Native Hawaiians to play an active role in plan-\nning and managing Native Hawaiian educational programs,\nand noted that Native Hawaiians disproportionally fell below\ntheir peers in terms of educational achievement and progress.\nId. § 4901(2) (1988) (repealed 1994). Congress then went on\nto affirm specifically the mission of Kamehameha Schools\nand the Schools’ model elementary curriculum, approving by\nname the Schools’ continued research and assessment activi-\nties. Id. § 4904(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). Similarly, Congress\ndirected the Secretary of Education to make grants to the\nSchools “for a demonstration program to provide Higher Edu-\ncation fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.” Id.\n§ 4905(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). The sole recipients of that\nassistance were to be “Native Hawaiians,” a term that was\ndefined in the statute, as it is by Kamehameha Schools, as “a\ndescendant of the aboriginal people, who prior to 1778, occu-\n\f19088             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises\nthe State of Hawaii.”11 Id. § 4909(1)(C) (1988) (repealed\n1994).\n\n   The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were repealed in 1994.\n20 U.S.C. § 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994). But for two reasons\nthat fact does not alter the landscape of Native Hawaiian-\noriented congressional enactments against which § 1981 must\nbe read. First, when Congress reenacted § 1981 in 1991, the\nHawkins-Stafford Amendments were still in effect. Second,\nCongress has continued thereafter to emphasize the need for\nspecial educational opportunities for Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents. (See Concurrence, pp. 19101-02.)\n\n   After reenacting § 1981, Congress passed the Native\nHawaiian Education Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. §§ 7901-7941,\nand then reenacted that statute in 2002, 20 U.S.C. §§ 7511-\n7517 (hereinafter “NHEA”). Like the Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments, the NHEA recognized the special needs of\nNative Hawaiian students and the great disadvantages that\nthey still face in Hawaii. Id. § 7512. As part of the No Child\nLeft Behind Act of 2001, a congressional committee favor-\nably mentioned the Bishop Trust and exhorted the Schools to\n“redouble [their] efforts” to provide for Native Hawaiians.\nH.R. Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333.\n\n   These steadfast congressional policies favoring remedial\nmeasures for Native Hawaiians—and specifically remedial\neducational measures, some of them even mentioning the\nSchools and the Bishop Trust approvingly by name—inform\nour analysis of the validity of the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy under § 1981. It would be incongruous to\nconclude that while Congress was repeatedly enacting reme-\ndial measures aimed exclusively at Native Hawaiians, at the\nsame time Congress would reject such Native Hawaiian pref-\n  11\n    According to the record, as we have noted, the Kamehameha Schools\ncurrently receive no money from Congress.\n\f                 DOE v.

Moreover, by reenacting § 1981 in\nthe midst of passing other legislation to provide specifically\nand particularly for the education of Native Hawaiians, Con-\ngress signaled its clear support for the Kamehameha Schools\nand for the validity of the Schools’ admissions policy.\n\n   [16] Accordingly, the most plausible reading of § 1981, in\nlight of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the NHEA, is\nthat Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawai-\nians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located\non the Hawaiian monarchy’s ancestral lands, be upheld\nbecause it furthers the urgent need for better education of\nNative Hawaiians, which Congress has repeatedly identified\nas necessary.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   [17] King Kamehameha I, on his death bed, is reported to\nhave said, “Tell my people I have planted in the soil of our\nland the roots of a plan for their happiness.” Princess Pauahi\nBishop and Her Legacy at 122. His great granddaughter, Prin-\ncess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, echoed that sentiment when she\nestablished, through her will, the Kamehameha Schools.\nBecause the Schools are a wholly private K-12 educational\nestablishment, whose preferential admissions policy is\ndesigned to counteract the significant, current educational def-\nicits of Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii, and because in\n1991 Congress clearly intended § 1981 to exist in harmony\nwith its other legislation providing specially for the education\nof Native Hawaiians, we must conclude that the admissions\npolicy is valid under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f19090             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges PREGER-\nSON, REINHARDT, PAEZ, and RAWLINSON join, concur-\nring:\n\n  I fully concur with Judge Graber’s majority opinion. How-\never, I write separately because there is an easier and nar-\nrower ground for upholding Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy.\n\n   The question in this case is whether 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for-\nbids Kamehameha Schools from giving Native Hawaiian\napplicants a conclusive preference for admission into its K-12\nprograms. In answering this question, the majority opinion\nassumes that “Native Hawaiian is a racial classification.” Op.\nat 19067 n.9. Based on this assumption, it holds that § 1981\npermits private schools, in certain circumstances, to prefer\ndisadvantaged minority groups — not limited to Native\nHawaiians — based on race. But the case before us does not\ninvolve an admissions policy generally favoring disadvan-\ntaged minorities, or favoring specific racial or ethnic groups\nsuch as African-Americans or Hispanics. It involves only an\nadmissions policy favoring “Native Hawaiians,” defined as\npersons “descended from the aboriginal people who exercised\nsovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778.” Op. at\n19058.\n\n   A narrower ground for sustaining Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy is that “Native Hawaiian” is not merely a\nracial classification. It is also a political classification. I would\ndivide the question in this case into two sub-questions. First,\ncan Congress constitutionally provide special benefits, includ-\ning educational benefits, to descendants of Native Hawaiians\nbecause “Native Hawaiian” is a political classification? Sec-\nond, if the answer to this question is yes, has Congress done\nso in § 1981?\n\n  I.    Constitutionality of Preference for Native Hawaiians\n\n  Because of their history, ably recounted in the majority\nopinion, Native Hawaiians constitute a unique population that\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19091\nhas a “special trust relationship” with the United States. Con-\ngress has repeatedly “affirmed,” “acknowledged,” “reaf-\nfirmed,” and “recognized” that relationship. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512(8)-(13); 42 U.S.C. § 11701(13)-(16), (19)-(21); see\nalso S. Joint Res. No. 19, Pub. L. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510\n(1993) (“Apology Resolution”). Based on this “historical and\nunique legal relationship,” Congress has enacted more than\n150 laws that “extend to the Hawaiian people the same rights\nand privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native,\nEskimo, and Aleut communities.” 42 U.S.C. § 11701(19); see\nRice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 533 (2000) (Stevens, J., dis-\nsenting); see also Jon M. Van Dyke, The Political Status of\nthe Native Hawaiian People, 17 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 95, 106\nn.67 (1998) (listing a sampling of statutes that provide sepa-\nrate benefit programs for Native Hawaiians or include them\nin benefit programs that assist other native people).\n\n   Congress has stated in support of such statutes that “the\npolitical status of Native Hawaiians is comparable to that of\nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives,” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512(12)(D), and that “[t]he authority of Congress under the\nUnited States Constitution to legislate in matters affecting the\naboriginal or indigenous peoples of the United States includes\nthe authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peo-\nples of Alaska and Hawaii.” 42 U.S.C. § 11701(17). Congress\nhas emphasized that it “does not extend services to Native\nHawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique\nstatus as indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to\nwhom the United States has established a trust relationship.”\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(12)(B).\n\n   In Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 539, 551 (1974),\n“non-Indian employees” of the Bureau of Indian Affairs chal-\nlenged a hiring preference for American Indians as “invidious\nracial discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment.” The Court held that the tribal Indian\nclassification is “political rather than racial in nature.” Id. at\n554 n.24. Benefits were “granted to Indians not as a discrete\n\f19092             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nracial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal\nentities.” Id. at 554. Citing the “special relationship” doctrine,\nthe Court held that the tribal Indian classification did not trig-\nger strict scrutiny.\n\n   The special relationship doctrine is based on an acknowl-\nedgment that the United States “ ‘overcame the Indians and\ntook possession of their lands, sometimes by force, leaving\nthem an uneducated, helpless and dependent people.’ ” Id. at\n552 (quoting Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705,\n715 (1943)); see also United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375,\n384 (1886) (“From their very weakness and helplessness, so\nlargely due to the course of dealing of the federal government\nwith them, and the treaties in which it has been promised,\nthere arises the duty of protection, and with it the power.”).\nThe Court in Mancari noted that “[i]t is in this historical and\nlegal context that the constitutional validity of the Indian pref-\nerence is to be determined.” 417 U.S. at 553. Since the prefer-\nence “can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress’\nunique obligation toward the Indians,” the Court held that it\ndoes not violate the equal protection component of the Due\nProcess Clause. Id. at 555.\n\n   In other contexts, the Supreme Court has not insisted on\ncontinuous tribal membership, or tribal membership at all, as\na justification for special treatment of Indians. In United\nStates v. John, 437 U.S. 634 (1978), decided after Mancari,\nthe Court held that “Indian country,” as used in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1151, included the Choctaw Indian Reservation in Missis-\nsippi. The Court noted that for many years the Choctaw lands\nin Mississippi had not been reservation lands, and that some\nChoctaws may have been considered to be reservation Indians\nbased on their having “one-half or more Indian blood” rather\nthan on any tribal membership. Id. at 650. The Court con-\ncluded, “Neither the fact that the Choctaws in Mississippi are\nmerely a remnant of a larger group of Indians, long ago\nremoved from Mississippi, nor the fact that federal supervi-\nsion over them has not been continuous, destroys the federal\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19093\npower to deal with them.” Id. at 653. In Delaware Tribal\nBusiness Committee v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73 (1977), also\ndecided after Mancari, the Court upheld against a due process\nchallenge a distribution of funds to both tribal and non-tribal\nIndians as “ ‘special treatment [that] can be tied rationally to\nthe fulfillment of Congress’ unique obligation toward the\nIndians.’ ” Id. at 85 (quoting Mancari, 417 U.S. at 555).\n\n   For its part, Congress has repeatedly provided special treat-\nment, including distribution of funds, based on broad defini-\ntions of the terms “Indian,” “native,” “Native American,” and\n“tribal organization” that encompass Indians who are not\nmembers of federally recognized tribes. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C.\n§ 479 (defining “Indian” to include “persons of one-half or\nmore Indian blood” who are not also tribal members); id.\n§ 500n (defining “natives of Alaska” as “native Indians, Eski-\nmos, and Aleuts of whole or part blood inhabiting Alaska at\nthe time of the Treaty of Cession of Alaska to the United\nStates and their descendants of whole or part blood”); id.\n§ 1603(c) (defining “Indian” to include “any individual who\n(1), irrespective of whether he or she lives on or near a reser-\nvation, is a member of a tribe, band, or other organized group\nof Indians, including those tribes, bands, or groups terminated\nsince 1940 and those recognized now or in the future by the\nState in which they reside, or who is a descendant, in the first\nor second degree, of any such member, or (2) is an Eskimo\nor Aleut or other Alaska Native, or (3) is considered by the\nSecretary of the Interior to be an Indian for any purpose”); id.\n§ 1679(b)(2) (defining “Eligible Indians” to include members\nof non-federally recognized tribes so long as the person can\ndemonstrate descent from an Indian resident in California as\nof 1852); id. § 2902(1) (defining “Native American” as “an\nIndian, Native Hawaiian, or Native American Pacific Island-\ner”); 38 U.S.C. § 3765(4) (defining “tribal organization” to\ninclude “the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, in the case\nof native Hawaiians, and such other organizations as the Sec-\nretary may prescribe”); 42 U.S.C. § 3002(20) (defining “Na-\ntive American” as a member of an Indian tribe or a Native\n\f19094            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nHawaiian); 43 U.S.C. § 1602(b) (defining “Native” as “a per-\nson of one-fourth degree or more Alaska Indian (including\nTsimshian Indians not enrolled in the Metlaktla Indian Com-\nmunity) Eskimo, or Aleut blood, or combination thereof”).\n\n   We observe “the time-honored presumption” that the pas-\nsage of the many federal statutes benefitting Native Hawai-\nians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians “is a\n‘constitutional exercise of legislative power.’ ” Reno v. Con-\ndon, 528 U.S. 141, 148 (2000) (quoting Close v. Glenwood\nCemetery, 107 U.S. 466, 475 (1883)). The basis for this exer-\ncise of power is Congress’ conclusion that “Native Hawai-\nian,” like “Alaska Native” and “Indian,” is a political\nclassification subject to the special relationship doctrine.\nUnless we were to hold that Congress cannot legislate for the\nspecial benefit of Native Hawaiians, thereby striking down\nthe enormous swaths of the United States Code enacted pur-\nsuant to the special relationship doctrine, we must conclude\nthat the doctrine permits Congress to provide special benefits\nto Native Hawaiians.\n\n   I recognize that the Court has struck down a statute grant-\ning preferential voting rights to Native Hawaiians, but voting\nrights are sui generis. In Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495\n(2000), the Supreme Court addressed a provision of the\nHawaiian Constitution limiting to “Hawaiians” the right to\nvote in a certain statewide election. The term “Hawaiians”\nwas generally defined as descendants of people inhabiting the\nHawaiian Islands in 1778. Id. at 499, 509. The Court held that\nunder the Fifteenth Amendment “Congress may not authorize\na State to create a voting scheme of this sort.” Id. at 519. In\nso holding, the Court assumed “authority in Congress, dele-\ngated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as\ntribes,” id., but it refused to extend the special relationship\ndoctrine to the “new and larger dimension” of voting restric-\ntions in state elections. Id. at 520.\n\n  The Court in Rice was careful to confine its analysis to vot-\ning rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. It cautioned that\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19095\n“[t]he validity of the voting restriction is the only question\nbefore us.” Id. at 521. Emphasizing the importance and\nunique character of voting rights under the Fifteenth Amend-\nment, the Court wrote, “the Amendment is cast in fundamen-\ntal terms, terms transcending the particular controversy which\nwas the immediate impetus for its enactment.” Id. at 512. Fur-\nther, “use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole\nlegal order democratic elections seek to preserve.” Id. at 517;\nsee also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 657 (1993) (“Racial\nclassifications with respect to voting carry particular dan-\ngers.”).\n\n   Unlike Rice, the case before us does not involve preferen-\ntial voting rights subject to challenge under the Fifteenth\nAmendment. Rather, it involves the preferential provision of\neducational benefits. To the extent that the federal Constitu-\ntion is implicated at all, the relevant text is the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Rice\nnever questioned the validity of the special relationship doc-\ntrine under the Fourteenth Amendment, and never even hinted\nthat its Fifteenth Amendment analysis would apply to the\nmany benefit programs enacted by Congress for Native\nHawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.\n\n  I therefore conclude that Congress may, if it wishes, permit\nKamehameha Schools to give preferential admissions treat-\nment to Native Hawaiians. The remaining question is whether\nCongress has in fact done so under § 1981.\n\n                           II.   Section 1981\n\n   When Congress enacted § 1981 in the Civil Rights Act of\n1866, Act of Apr. 9, 1866, ch. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27, and reen-\nacted it four years later in the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act\nof May 31, 1870, ch. 114, §§ 16, 18, 16 Stat. 144, the Hawai-\nian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people were\nnot “within the jurisdiction of the United States.”1 As stated\n  1\n    The 1866 statute used slightly different language, but to the same\neffect: the statute applied to “all persons born in the United States and not\nsubject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed.” 14 Stat. 27.\n\f19096               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nby Congress, “from 1826 until 1893, the United States recog-\nnized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended\nfull and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian\nGovernment, and entered into treaties and conventions with\nthe Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation\nin 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.” Apology Resolution,\nPub. L. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. at 1510.\n\n   For many years after the Hawaiian Kingdom was over-\nthrown in 1893, and even after the State of Hawaii was admit-\nted to the Union in 1959, § 1981 posed no threat to\nKamehameha Schools’ preferential admissions policy. But in\n1976 the Supreme Court held that § 1981 reaches both (1)\nadmissions programs at private schools that categorically\nexclude African-Americans, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.\n160 (1976), and (2) racial discrimination in private employ-\nment against whites as well as nonwhites, McDonald v. Santa\nFe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273 (1976). Together, these\ncases intimated that § 1981 might prohibit private school\nadmissions policies that exclude whites.\n\n   In 1991, Congress revised and reenacted § 1981. See Civil\nRights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 101, 105 Stat.\n1071, 1071-72. By this time, Congress had enacted numerous\nstatutes that provided exclusive benefit programs for Native\nHawaiians or included them in benefit programs for other\nnative peoples. Indeed, just a few years before reenacting\n§ 1981, Congress passed many laws that gave exclusive con-\ntractual or grant benefits to Native Hawaiians and Native\nHawaiian organizations.2 Congress proclaimed that its Native\n  2\n    See, e.g., Native American Programs Act Amendments of 1987, Pub.\nL.

The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments, passed in\n1988, instructed the Secretary of Education to “make grants\n\nprojects designed to meet the educational needs of gifted and talented chil-\ndren); Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986, Pub.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nto the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate for\na demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellow-\nship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.” Id. § 4005(a),\n102 Stat. at 360. One year before reenacting § 1981, Congress\namended the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary\nto “provide funds to Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate for\nthe purpose of providing scholarship assistance” to eligible\nNative Hawaiian students. Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub. L. No.\n101-644, § 401, 104 Stat. 4662, 4668 (codified as amended at\n42 U.S.C. §254s). These federal statutes specifically directed\nKamehameha Schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this\ncase say is forbidden by § 1981.\n\n   It was not until the 1991 amendments to § 1981 that Con-\ngress specified that it intends courts to apply the statute to\nsubstantive discrimination by private actors. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(c) (“The rights protected by this section are protected\nagainst impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and\nimpairment under color of State law.”). In order to hold for\nplaintiff in this case, we would have to conclude that Con-\ngress intended this provision to invalidate, sub silentio, the\nrecently enacted legislation that provided loans and scholar-\nships exclusively to Native Hawaiians at Kamehameha\nSchools. But this conclusion would require us to turn our back\non the Supreme Court’s analysis in Mancari, where it rejected\nthe challenge of non-Indian plaintiffs to Indian employment\npreferences as inconsistent with the federal Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Act of 1972.\n\n  The Mancari plaintiffs argued that\n\n    since the [Equal Employment Opportunity Act of\n    1972] proscribed racial discrimination in Govern-\n    ment employment, the Act necessarily, albeit sub\n    silentio, repealed the provision of the [Indian Reor-\n    ganization Act of 1934] that called for the preference\n    in the [Bureau of Indian Affairs] of one racial group,\n    Indians, over non-Indians.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19099\nMancari, 417 U.S. at 547. The 1972 Act, upon which the\nMancari plaintiffs relied, amended Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. Id. at 546-47. Whereas the 1964 Civil\nRights Act had expressly exempted certain Indian prefer-\nences, neither the text nor the legislative history of the amend-\ning 1972 Act made any reference to such preferences. Id.\nGiven that the 1972 Act was specifically modeled on the 1964\nAct, the omission of an exemption for Indian preferences was\nespecially glaring, and the plaintiffs’ argument for sub silentio\nrepeal especially strong.\n\n   Nevertheless, the Supreme Court unanimously and emphat-\nically rejected the argument for sub silentio repeal by the\n1972 Amendment:\n\n    It would be anomalous to conclude that Congress\n    intended to eliminate the longstanding statutory\n    preferences in BIA employment, as being racially\n    discriminatory, at the very same time it was reaf-\n    firming the right of tribal and reservation-related\n    private employers to provide Indian preference.\n    Appellees’ assertion that Congress implicitly\n    repealed the preference as racially discriminatory,\n    while retaining the 1964 preferences, attributes to\n    Congress irrationality and arbitrariness, an attribu-\n    tion we do not share.\n\n    . . . Three months after Congress passed the 1972\n    amendments, it enacted two new Indian preference\n    laws . . . . It is improbable, to say the least, that the\n    same Congress which affirmatively approved and\n    enacted these additional and similar Indian prefer-\n    ences was, at the same time, condemning the BIA\n    preference as racially discriminatory. In the total\n    absence of any manifestation of supportive intent,\n    we are loathe to imply this improbable result.\n\n                             ***\n\f19100            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n       This is a prototypical case where an adjudication\n    of repeal by implication is not appropriate. The pref-\n    erence is a longstanding, important component of\n    the Government’s Indian program. The anti-\n    discrimination provision, aimed at alleviating\n    minority discrimination in employment, obviously is\n    designed to deal with an entirely different and,\n    indeed, opposite problem. Any perceived conflict is\n    thus more apparent than real.\n\n    . . . A provision aimed at furthering Indian self-\n    government by according an employment preference\n    within the BIA for qualified members of the gov-\n    erned group can readily co-exist with a general rule\n    prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis\n    of race. Any other conclusion can be reached only by\n    formalistic reasoning that ignores both the history\n    and purposes of the preference and the unique legal\n    relationship between the Federal Government and\n    tribal Indians.\n\n        Furthermore, the Indian preference statute is a\n    specific provision applying to a very specific situa-\n    tion. The 1972 Act, on the other hand, is of general\n    application. Where there is no clear intention other-\n    wise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nul-\n    lified by a general one, regardless of the priority of\n    enactment.\n\n       The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose\n    among congressional enactments, and when two stat-\n    utes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the\n    courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional\n    intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\n\nId. at 548-51 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n   The principal dissent insists that the failure of § 1981 to\ninclude in its text an explicit exception for Native Hawaiians\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19101\nis fatal to Kamehameha Schools’ admissions policy. But of all\nthe federal statutes to which strict text-based rules of statutory\nconstruction might be applied, § 1981 is a particularly inap-\npropriate candidate. The text of § 1981 only guarantees “the\nsame right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed\nby white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). It does not guarantee\nthe converse — the right of white persons or citizens to enjoy\nthe same contractual rights as non-whites. Therefore, accord-\ning to the dissent’s interpretive method, § 1981 should not be\nread to protect nonwhites against private racial discrimination.\nBut we know that, despite the clear text of § 1981, this con-\nclusion would be wrong, for the Supreme Court held in 1976\nthat whites as well as non-whites are protected under § 1981.\nMcDonald, 427 U.S. at 286-87.\n\n   Congress’ provision of educational benefits to Native\nHawaiians continues to this day. Congress repealed the Native\nHawaiian provisions of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments\nonly to replace them with the more comprehensive Native\nHawaiian Education Act (“NHEA”), Pub. L. No. 103-382,\n§§ 9201 et seq., 108 Stat. 3794 (1994) (formerly codified at\n20 U.S.C. §§ 7901 et seq.) (repealed 2002), which Congress\nlater reenacted in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. 20\nU.S.C. §§ 7511 et seq. As part of the No Child Left Behind\nAct of 2001, a congressional committee exhorted the Bishop\nTrust, which finances Kamehameha Schools, to “redouble its\nefforts to educate Native Hawaiian children.” H.R. Rep. No.\n107-63(I), at 333.\n\n   The NHEA continues to allocate money to private non-\nprofit organizations to provide programs for the exclusive\nbenefit of Native Hawaiians. See 20 U.S.C. § 7515. Kameha-\nmeha Schools’ definition of “Native Hawaiian” is virtually\nidentical to that used in the NHEA. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7517(1)(B) (defining “Native Hawaiian” as “a descendant\nof the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and\nexercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State\nof Hawaii”). The NHEA expressly declares that “Congress\n\f19102            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ndoes not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their\nrace, but because of their unique status as the indigenous peo-\nple of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States\nhas established a trust relationship.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(12)(B).\n\n   Through the NHEA and the myriad other federal statutes\nthat confer benefits on Native Hawaiians, Congress has made\nmanifest its intent to apply some form of the special relation-\nship doctrine to Native Hawaiians. The well established gen-\neral rule is that less — not more — demanding scrutiny\napplies to private discrimination than to government-\nsponsored discrimination. It would be deeply ironic for us to\nhold that § 1981 forbids private institutions from giving\nNative Hawaiians educational benefits when, at the same\ntime, Congress itself provides such benefits and provides pub-\nlic funds for private organizations to do the same.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n   Congress has invariably treated “Native Hawaiian” as a\npolitical classification for purposes of providing exclusive\neducational and other benefits. Under the special relationship\ndoctrine, Congress has the power to do so. I see nothing in\n§ 1981 to indicate that Congress intended to impose upon pri-\nvate institutions a more restrictive standard for the provision\nof benefits to Native Hawaiians than it has imposed upon\nitself.\n\fDOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS           19103\n                            Volume 2 of 2\n\f19104            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n\n\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges KOZINSKI,\nO’SCANNLAIN, TALLMAN, and CALLAHAN join, and\nwith whom Judges RYMER and KLEINFELD join in Parts II\nand III, dissenting:\n\n   This case involves the application of one of the Republic’s\noldest and most enduring civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981. That statute—originally enacted as section sixteen of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1870—provides in pertinent part that,\n“All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall\nhave the same right in every State and Territory to make and\nenforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(a) (2000). Enacted soon after the passage of\nthe Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, § 1981 like—and\nperhaps more than—most of the reconstruction era civil rights\nenactments was intended to ensure “that a dollar in the hands\nof [any citizen] will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the\nhands of a white man.” Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392\nU.S. 409, 443 (1968). Applying that principle in Runyon v.\nMcCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 168, 179 (1976), the Supreme Court\nheld that § 1981 “prohibits private, commercially operated,\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19105\nnon-sectarian schools from denying admission to prospective\nstudents because they are” not members of a favored racial\ngroup. Indeed, as Runyon makes clear, discriminating against\na private school applicant solely on the basis of that appli-\ncant’s race “amounts to a classic violation of § 1981.” Id. at\n172.\n\n   Despite that well-established principle, the majority today\nstands Runyon on its head and holds that a private school may\ndeny admission to a prospective student solely because he or\nshe is not a member of a particular race. Though I agree with\nthe majority that Native Hawaiians suffer from severe socio-\neconomic disadvantages and believe that Kamehameha\nSchools (“Kamehameha”) should be commended for attempt-\ning to remedy those hardships, I cannot concur with the\nmajority’s dramatic departure from Runyon.\n\n   In my view, the majority has made a number of crucial mis-\ntakes. Thus, as set out below in Part I, even though I agree\nwith the majority that Title VII and not strict scrutiny pro-\nvides the standard of review in this case, I disagree with the\nmajority’s sweeping modification of the Title VII standard.\nMoreover, even if I agreed with the majority’s departure from\nthat standard, I could not subscribe to the majority’s decision\nto sanction an absolute racial bar. Likewise, as set out in Part\nII, I cannot accept as a matter of faithful statutory construc-\ntion the majority’s view that Congress implicitly exempted\nracial preferences for Native Hawaiians from § 1981 by pass-\ning unrelated—and even since repealed—statutes. Indeed, I\nbelieve the majority’s novel approach to statutory interpreta-\ntion is readily emanipulable and would enable courts to\nrewrite statutes whenever they want to save a particular pro-\ngram, contract, or enactment. Finally, as set out in Part III,\nbecause Native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recog-\nnized tribe and Kamehameha is a private party, I also disagree\nwith Judge Fletcher’s suggestion that the special relationship\ndoctrine of Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), can save\nKamehameha’s racially exclusive admissions policy.\n\f19106            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   As much as I may believe that Kamehameha should be\napplauded for providing its students an exceptional education\nand for attempting to remedy the socioeconomic disadvan-\ntages facing Native Hawaiians, I cannot turn a blind eye to a\nclassic violation of § 1981. Noble as Kamehameha’s goals\nmay be, good intentions are not license to violate our civil\nrights laws. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n        I.   REVIEW OF § 1981 UNDER TITLE VII\n                     STANDARDS\n\n   The John Doe plaintiff contends that Kamehameha’s\nadmissions policy—which bars the admission of any non-\nNative Hawaiian student, see Maj. Op. at 19080 & n.10—\nviolates 42 U.S.C. § 1981 because, as Runyon v. McCrary,\n427 U.S. 160 (1976), makes clear, discriminating against a\nprivate school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant’s\nrace “amounts to a classic violation of § 1981.” Id. at 172.\nDespite the inherent logic of plaintiff’s argument, the majority\navoids reaching a similar conclusion by holding “[q]uite sim-\nply, Runyon is inapposite,” Maj. Op. at 19077, and grafting a\nmodified Title VII standard onto § 1981.\n\n   To create that new standard, the majority dismisses Runyon\nas irrelevant because “[t]he program at issue in Runyon would\ncertainly fail” the majority’s analysis. Id. In so holding, how-\never, the majority ignores the critical fact that the admissions\nprograms involved in Runyon—like Kamehameha’s- violated\n§ 1981 because they used race as the determinative admis-\nsions factor. Instead, the majority converts Runyon into a case\nabout a “whites-only admissions” program that is “inappo-\nsite” to Kamehameha’s Native Hawaiians-only admissions\npolicy. Id. I find the majority’s decision to dismiss Runyon in\norder to approve a policy that bars African American (and any\nother) children who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry to be\nunfortunate and wrong.\n\n   Putting those concerns aside for the moment, and turning\nto the next step in the majority’s analysis, the majority holds\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                   19107\nthat Title VII scrutiny, and not strict scrutiny, applies to\nalleged § 1981 violations. Maj. Op. at 19071-72. That second\nstep in the majority’s analysis is sound. Like the majority, I\nagree that Title VII standards and not strict scrutiny must\napply to § 1981 actions because to hold otherwise would\neffectively render the Title VII’s provisions that expressly\ncontemplate affirmative action plans nonsensical. Maj. Op. at\n19070-71; see also Schurr v. Resorts Int’l Hotel, Inc., 196\nF.3d 486, 498-99 (3d Cir. 1999); Edmonson v. United States\nSteel Corp., 659 F.2d 582, 584 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam);\nSetser v. Novack Inv. Co., 657 F.2d 962, 966-68 (8th Cir.\n1981) (en banc).\n\n   Applying the Title VII approach, the majority also correctly\nholds that the burden shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), applies to plaintiff’s\n§ 1981 claim. See Maj. Op. at 19068-69. Under that test,\n“[t]he complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial\nburden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination.” McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.\nWhere an explicit race-based policy exists, proof of that fact\nalone is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. If the plain-\ntiff proves his prima facie case, a rebuttable presumption of\nintentional discrimination arises, see Tex. Dep’t of Cmty.\nAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981), and the burden\nof production “shift[s] to the employer to articulate some\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the conduct at issue.\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. “The existence of an\naffirmative action plan provides such a rationale.” Johnson v.\nTransp. Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 626 (1987). “If such a plan is\narticulated as the basis for the employer’s decision, the burden\nshifts to the plaintiff to prove that . . . the plan is invalid.” Id.\n\n   As Kamehameha concedes that it employs a preference that\nfavors Native Hawaiian applicants, plaintiff has met his bur-\nden to show a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Maj.\nOp. at 19072. Kamehameha argues, however, that its conduct\nis permissible because its admissions policy was executed\n\f19108                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npursuant to an affirmative action plan, thereby rebutting the\npresumption of illegality. Thus, as the majority concludes,\nthis case hinges entirely on the third step of the McDonnell\nDouglas analysis—i.e., whether Kamehameha’s plan is\ninvalid. See Maj. Op. at 19072-73.\n\n   It is at this point, when the majority entirely reworks the\nstandards for determining whether an affirmative action plan\nis valid, that the majority’s analysis goes astray. Under United\nSteelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), and\nJohnson v. Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), an\naffirmative action program must satisfy the following factors\nto be considered valid: (1) It must be “justified by the exis-\ntence of a ‘manifest imbalance’ ” in the employer’s workforce\nthat is reflective of traditionally segregated job categories; (2)\nit may not “ ‘unnecessarily trammel[ ] the rights of [other]\nemployees or create[ ] an absolute bar to their advance-\nment’ ”; and (3) it must “be designed to do [no] more than\n‘attain a balance.’ ” Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 F.3d 506, 520\n(9th Cir. 2002) (first and third alteration in original) (quoting\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 631, 637-38, 639).1\n\n   Reasoning that primary and secondary educational con-\ntracts are different, however, the majority alters all three fac-\ntors and holds that a private school may discriminate on the\nbasis of race whenever: (1) “significant imbalances in educa-\n   1\n     Rudebusch did not include the requirement that the “manifest imbal-\nance” be present in a job category that was traditionally segregated in its\nstatement of the Title VII test. See 313 F.3d at 520. However, all of the\ncases we cited in Rudebusch to support the manifest imbalance factor\nincluded the traditional segregated job category requirement in their state-\nment of the test. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631; Weber, 443 U.S. at 204;\nHiggins v. City of Vallejo, 823 F.2d 351, 356 (9th Cir. 1987). Rudebusch\ngives no indication that it intentionally excluded this aspect of the require-\nment, and the defendant did not argue that this requirement had not been\nmet. Thus, I do not believe that Rudebusch loosened the requirement that\na job category must be traditionally segregated before an affirmative\naction plan is permissible.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19109\ntional achievement [in the community as a whole] presently\naffect the target population”; (2) the discriminatory policy\ndoes not “unnecessarily trammel[ ] the rights of students in\nthe non-preferred” racial group as a whole “or create an abso-\nlute bar to their advancement”; and (3) “the [discriminatory]\npolicy [does] no more than is necessary to correct the imbal-\nance . . . identified at the first step.” Maj. Op. at 19077.\n\n   Though I recognize that the Title VII standard was forged\nin the employment discrimination context and that some mod-\nification may be necessary to adapt it to other settings, I dis-\nagree, as explained below, with the majority’s general\njustification for departing from precedent and with each spe-\ncific alteration it makes to the Title VII standard. Further-\nmore, I also disagree with the majority’s application of its\nown standard.\n\n  A.   The Majority’s Modification of the Title VII Standard\n\n   The majority creates a standard that, by its own terms,\napplies only to primary and secondary schools. It grounds that\ndecision entirely on its finding that the ordinary Title VII\nstandard, which was developed in the employment setting,\ncannot apply to primary and secondary educational contracts.\nBut, there is absolutely nothing in § 1981’s text to suggest\nthat contracts made with “private employers [that] strive pri-\nmarily to make money[ ] and public employers [that] perform\na specific public function” should be subject to a different\nstandard than primary and secondary schools that have “a\nmuch broader [external] mission.” Maj. Op. at 19076. Indeed,\nthe majority neglects the fact that § 1981 guarantees to “[a]ll\npersons . . . the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a)\n(emphasis added). Given § 1981’s plain text, then, it is not\nsurprising that the majority cannot cite a single case to sup-\nport the novel proposition that primary and secondary educa-\ntional contracts are different from other contracts and are\nentitled to special treatment under § 1981.\n\f19110            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has rejected that very argument.\nFor instance, far from finding that a school’s “much broader\nmission” or external focus made a difference, Runyon—which\ninvolved a racially exclusive primary and secondary private\nschool admissions policy—reasoned:\n\n    It is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by\n    the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe’s Private\n    School amounts to a classic violation of § 1981. The\n    parents . . . sought to enter into contractual relation-\n    ships with [the schools] for educational services. . . .\n    Under those contractual relationships, the schools\n    would have received payments for services rendered,\n    and the prospective students would have received\n    instruction in return for those payments . . . .\n    [N]either school offered services on equal basis to\n    white and nonwhite students. . . . [Plaintiffs] were\n    denied admission to the schools because of their\n    race. The . . . conclusion that § 1981 was thereby\n    violated follows inexorably from the language of\n    that statute, as construed in [prior Supreme Court\n    case law].\n\n427 U.S. at 172-73 (quotation and citation omitted) (footnote\nomitted). Thus, the majority’s argument that primary and sec-\nondary private school educational contracts should be treated\ndifferently from other contracts under § 1981 was squarely\nrejected in Runyon, and I would adhere to that precedent.\n\n   Similarly, the majority’s rationale does not find any support\nin Title VII jurisprudence. Indeed, under Title VII the\nSupreme Court has uniformly measured affirmative action\nprograms against the standard established in Weber as\nexplained above. For example, Johnson employed Weber to\ndetermine the validity of a county transportation agency’s\naffirmative action program under Title VII. 480 U.S. at 626-\n40; see also id. at 631 (“[W]e must first examine whether [the\nemployment] decision was made pursuant to a plan prompted\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        19111\nby concerns similar to those of the employer in Weber. Next,\nwe must determine whether the effect of the plan on [the non-\npreferred race] is comparable to the effect of the Plan in that\ncase.”); id. at 627 (“The assessment of the legality of the\nAgency Plan must be guided by our decision in Weber.”\n(footnote omitted)).\n\n   Our own jurisprudence has closely followed the Supreme\nCourt’s lead in this area, and, as the majority candidly con-\ncedes, under Title VII, we have always applied the same stan-\ndard, even when the program “at issue was not wholly\nanalogous to the hiring and promotional plans at issue in\nWeber and Johnson because of some significant conceptual\ndifferences between the types of plans,” Maj. Op. at 19074\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2 Our sister\ncircuits have done the same, even when the case involved pri-\n  2\n    We have considered the validity of affirmative action plans in a wide\nvariety of contexts, and we have always applied the same Title VII stan-\ndard. See, e.g., Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 979 F.2d 721,\n723, 725-26 (9th Cir. 1992) (evaluating a police examination scoring\nregime designed “to promote a higher percentage of minority officers”\nunder an unmodified Title VII standard); Higgins v. City of Vallejo, 823\nF.2d 351, 356-58 (9th Cir. 1987) (evaluating a fire department’s affirma-\ntive action program under an unmodified Title VII standard); La Riviere\nv. EEOC, 682 F.2d 1275, 1278-80 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that affirmative\naction plans by public employers should be subjected to an unmodified\nTitle VII standard, and evaluating a California Highway Patrol affirmative\naction program under that standard); see also Gilligan v. Dep’t of Labor,\n81 F.3d 835, 837 (9th Cir. 1996) (discussing an affirmative action program\nat the Department of Labor and stating that the test of its validity is an\nunmodified Title VII standard). Indeed, we have also ruled in multiple\nTitle VII cases involving affirmative action practices at educational insti-\ntutions, and we have never even suggested that conduct by such institu-\ntions might be subjected to a different standard. See, e.g., Rudebusch, 313\nF.3d 506 (considering a university’s equity pay adjustment under Title\nVII’s standards for affirmative action programs); Cerrato v. S.F. Cmty.\nColl. Dist., 26 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 1994) (affirming a district court judg-\nment dismissing a claim, brought by a professor who was passed over for\nthe position of dean, that challenged the district’s affirmative action policy\nunder an unmodified Title VII standard).\n\f19112                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nmary and secondary schools that have “a much broader\n[external] mission.” See, e.g., Taxman v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp.\nof Piscataway, 91 F.3d 1547, 1564 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc)\n(evaluating a plan for the hiring and firing of primary and sec-\nondary school teachers under the Weber standard), cert.\ngranted, 521 U.S. 1117 (1997), cert. dismissed, 522 U.S.\n1010 (1997); Cunico v. Pueblo Sch. Dist. No. 60, 917 F.2d\n431, 437-38 (10th Cir. 1990) (evaluating a race conscious lay-\noff plan for primary and secondary school personnel under the\nWeber standard).\n\n   The majority fails to explain why we must create a special\nstandard for primary and secondary educational contract cases.3\nIf anything, as highlighted above, Runyon compels the con-\nclusion that a primary and secondary educational contract—\nlike any other contract—that discriminates solely on the basis\nof race violates § 1981. See 427 U.S. at 172. As noted above,\nI also disagree with the majority’s far-reaching adaption of all\nthree of the Supreme Court’s factors for determining the\nvalidity of an affirmative action program, to which I now turn.\n  3\n    The majority’s reference to the First Amendment roots of “educational\nautonomy,” see Maj. Op. at 19074, is misleading since the Supreme Court\nhas consistently rejected First Amendment interests as a justification for\nracial discrimination. See, e.g., Runyon, 427 U.S. at 176 (holding that\nwhile, “it may be assumed that parents have a First Amendment right to\nsend their children to educational institutions that promote” racial discrim-\nination, “it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities\nfrom such institutions is also protected by the same principle”); Norwood\nv. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 470 (1973) (holding, “[i]nvidious private dis-\ncrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of asso-\nciation protected by the First Amendment, but it has never been accorded\naffirmative constitutional protections”); see also Hishon v. King & Spal-\nding, 467 U.S. 69, 78 (1984) (noting that under the First Amendment,\n“[t]here is no constitutional right, for example, to discriminate in the selec-\ntion of who may attend a private school or join a labor union”).\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19113\n    1. Manifest        Imbalance      Reflecting      Traditional\n    Segregation\n\n   The majority has substantially modified the Court’s first\nfactor. Under the first Weber and Johnson factor, the Supreme\nCourt has required that a Title VII affirmative action program\nbe “justified by the existence of a manifest imbalance that\nreflected underrepresentation of [the favored group] in tradi-\ntionally segregated job categories.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631\n(internal quotation marks ommitted); accord Weber, 443 U.S.\nat 208, 209; id. at 212-15 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Our\ncases have consistently and faithfully applied this require-\nment. See, e.g., Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. Comm’n,\n979 F.2d 721, 725 (9th Cir. 1992) (“Under Title VII analysis,\nvoluntary adoption of a race-based remedy may be justified\nby a showing that a manifest imbalance exists, reflecting\nunderrepresentation of [the favored group] in traditionally\nsegregated job categories.” (internal quotations omitted));\nDavis v. City & County of S.F., 890 F.2d 1438, 1448 (9th Cir.\n1989) (same); Higgins v. City of Vallejo, 823 F.2d 351, 356\n(9th Cir. 1987) (same); La Riviere v. EEOC, 682 F.2d 1275,\n1278 (9th Cir. 1982) (applying the same standard to a sex-\nbased affirmative action plan).\n\n   Likewise, we have consistently applied the Supreme\nCourt’s holding that “[i]n determining whether an imbalance\nexists that would justify taking . . . race into account, a com-\nparison of the percentage of minorities . . . in the employer’s\nwork force with the percentage in the area labor market . . .\nis appropriate . . . .” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631-32 (emphasis\nadded); accord Weber, 443 U.S. at 204-206; Davis, 890 F.2d\nat 1448 (“To determine whether such an imbalance has\noccurred, the court may compare the percentage of minorities\nor women in the employer’s work force with the percentage\nin the area labor market or general population.” (emphasis\nadded)); Higgins, 823 F.2d at 356-57 (similar).\n\n   In other words, until today, two findings were required to\nsatisfy this first factor: (1) the present existence of a manifest\n\f19114            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nimbalance in a particular job category in the employer’s work-\nforce; and (2) that this imbalance stems from historical segre-\ngation in that job category. Those separate requirements\nguaranteed two critical things: First, with respect to the scope\nof the program, they guaranteed that there was a particular\ngoal in sight—namely, representation of the historically dis-\nadvantaged group in the employer’s workforce in proportion\nto its representation in the relevant labor pool. Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 631-32, 633 n.10; Weber, 443 U.S. at 198-99, 208-09.\nBy requiring a goal based on the employer’s own practices,\nWeber and Johnson were willing to permit affirmative action\nprograms without giving all employers license to discriminate\nin favor of any group that currently finds itself disadvantaged\nanywhere in the labor market. Second, those requirements\nensured that there was a temporal constraint, a well-defined\npoint after which the preference program would no longer be\nnecessary—that is, once the “manifest imbalance” in the\nemployer’s workforce had been corrected. Johnson, 480 U.S.\nat 632 (“The requirement that ‘the manifest imbalance’ relate\nto a ‘traditionally segregated job category’ provides assurance\nboth that sex or race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII’s purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination, and that the interests of those\nemployees not benefiting from the plan will not be unduly\ninfringed.”); Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09 (“[T]he plan is a tem-\nporary measure; it is not intended to maintain racial balance,\nbut simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance. Preferen-\ntial selection of craft trainees at the Gramercy plant will end\nas soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the\nGramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the\nlocal labor force.”). Moreover, an affirmative action program\nthat correlates to an employer’s own internal practices is nec-\nessarily limited in scope and time, because correcting the\n“manifest imbalance” is reasonably within the employer’s\ncontrol.\n\n  In contrast to Weber and Johnson, the majority’s test\nmerely requires a private school to “demonstrate that specific,\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        19115\nsignificant imbalances in educational achievement presently\naffect the target population” in the relevant community.4 Maj.\nOp. at 19076. Thus, by completely eliminating any school-\nbased analysis and jettisoning any historical inquiry,5 the\nmajority rejects the constraint developed in the Title VII con-\ntext that affirmative action programs must be limited in scope\nand duration. Indeed, the majority effectively green-lights dis-\ncrimination so long as the identified group currently suffers\nfrom “significant imbalances in educational achievement.” Id.\nat 19079. Because such a broad and perpetual license con-\nflicts with the Supreme Court’s consistent emphasis on the\nlimited and temporary nature of permissible affirmative action\nplans, see, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v. EEOC,\n478 U.S. 421, 475-79 (1986), I cannot endorse the majority’s\nnew standard. See also, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n306, 342 (2003) (“The requirement that all race-conscious\nadmissions programs have a termination point ‘assure[s] all\ncitizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment\nof all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a mea-\nsure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.’ ” (quot-\ning Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 510 (1989)\n(plurality opinion)); Weber, 443 U.S. at 208 (noting the affir-\nmative action plan in that case was “a temporary measure”);\nW. States Paving Co., Inc. v. Wash. State Dep’t of Transp.,\n  4\n     It is not entirely clear what constitutes the relevant community under\nthe majority’s new test, but it appears the majority means the state where\nthe affirmative action program has been adopted. See Maj. Op. at 19076.\nFor instance, in announcing its new test, the majority maintains that “the\nrelevant population is the community as a whole,” id., but when the major-\nity applies that test, it appears that, “[t]he relevant community in this case\nis the state of Hawaii,” id. at 19078.\n   5\n     Whereas the majority justifies neither purge, the second modification\nis particularly puzzling given the majority’s repeated suggestion that his-\ntory is of particular significance in this case. See, e.g., id. at 19054-56 &\nn.2 (providing detailed information on Hawaiian history to “set[ ] the stage\nfor our more particular consideration of the educational status of Native\nHawaiian children”); id. at 19072 (“The question remains how best to\nadapt the Title VII employment framework to an educational context and\nto the unique historical circumstances of this case.” (emphasis added)).\n\f19116             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n407 F.3d 983, 994 (9th Cir. 2005) (“A narrowly tailored\nremedial program must also include adequate durational limi-\ntations.”); Smith v. Univ. of Wash., 392 F.3d 367, 375 (9th\nCir. 2004) (“[R]ace-conscious admissions programs must be\nlimited in time.”).\n\n    2. Unnecessary Trammeling the Rights of the Non-\n    Preferred Group\n\n   The majority’s alteration of Weber and Johnson’s second\nfactor is similarly problematic. Under the second factor, an\naffirmative action plan must not “unnecessarily trammel[ ] the\nrights of [members of the disfavored group] or create[ ] an\nabsolute bar to their advancement.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 637-\n38; accord Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. The majority echoes this\ntest, Maj. Op. at 19077, but it makes two important modifica-\ntions.\n\n   First, under the majority’s test, whether a discriminatory\npolicy creates an absolute bar or unnecessarily trammels the\nrights of the disfavored race is determined by reference to\n“the respective rights of members of the non-preferred group”\n“viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a single\nschool.” Maj. Op. at 19077. Thus, under the majority’s new\nstandard, we must not consider the rights of a non-preferred\nindividual at the institution in question but in the larger con-\ntext of his ability to access quality education. See id. at 19077.\nAgain, as indicated above, that standard conflicts with the\nestablished principle that we look at the particular institution\nadopting the affirmative action program to determine whether\nthe rights of a member of the disfavored group have been\ntrammeled. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (“[W]hile peti-\ntioner in this case was denied a promotion, he retained his\nemployment with the Agency, at the same salary and with the\nsame seniority, and remained eligible for other promotions.”);\nid. at 638 n.15 (“Of the 111 new Skilled Craft jobs [at the\nAgency] during [the relevant] period, 105, or almost 95%,\nwent to men.”); id. at 642 (“The decision to [hire Joyce\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19117\ninstead of the plaintiff] was made pursuant to an affirmative\naction plan that represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case\napproach to effecting a gradual improvement in the represen-\ntation of minorities and women in the Agency’s work force.”\n(emphasis added)); Weber, 443 U.S. at 208 (“The plan does\nnot require the discharge of white workers and their replace-\nment with new black hirees. Nor does the plan create an abso-\nlute bar to the advancement of white employees; half of those\ntrained in the program will be white.” (citation omitted)).\n\n   Indeed, it is contrary to the spirit—and, I had always\nassumed, based on the cases cited above, the letter—of the\ncivil rights laws to explain to a worker who has been discrimi-\nnated against that the situation is not so bad because there are\nlots of other jobs available. Yet that is the essence of the\nmajority’s new standard: If the majority thinks there are ade-\nquate educational alternatives for the disfavored race, then the\nfact that the institution in question has discriminated against\nthat race is of no concern. “Context” alone cannot explain\nwhy, under the majority’s view, racial discrimination in some\ncommunities would be wrong and actionable, but in other\ncommunities, it would be acceptable and praiseworthy. I can-\nnot join the majority’s analysis.\n\n   The majority makes a second important modification and\nannounces that in determining whether an affirmative action\nplan trammels rights or creates an absolute bar, we do not\nlook at whether an individual has been denied an opportunity,\nbut whether the individual’s racial group “within the commu-\nnity as a whole” has been denied an opportunity. See Maj. Op.\nat 19080-81 (holding that because “nothing in the record sug-\ngests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for\nstudents, like Plaintiff, who lack any native Hawaiian ances-\ntry,” Kamehameha’s admissions “policy neither unnecessarily\ntrammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor absolutely\nbars their advancement in the relevant community.” (empha-\nsis added)); id. at 19081 (holding that because “[non-Native\nHawaiian] students denied admission by Kamehameha\n\f19118                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nSchools[, as “statistical data” demonstrates,] have ample and\nadequate alternative educational options,” Kamehameha’s\nadmissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel rights or\ncreate an absolute bar (emphasis added)). That standard, how-\never, conflicts with both the plain meaning of § 1981 and the\nbasic premise that civil rights laws are “design[ed] to protect\nindividuals of all races,” McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp.\nCo., 427 U.S. 273, 288 n.19 (1976) (emphasis added), and\n“not merely a group of individuals, or a body of persons\naccording to their numbers,” Mitchell v. United States, 313\nU.S. 80, 97 (1941). Since, by its own terms, § 1981 “explic-\nitly applies to ‘all persons’ ” and not simply groups of indi-\nviduals, McDonald, 427 U.S. at 287 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(a)), the majority’s holding that § 1981 protects groups\ninstead of “all persons” contradicts the statute’s plain meaning.6\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court has made clear, “[§] 1981, at a\nminimum, reaches discrimination against an individual\nbecause he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and\nphysiognomically distinctive sub-grouping of homo sapiens,”\nSaint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987)\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted), and not\n  6\n    Recognizing that the majority’s new standard conflicts with § 1981’s\nplain text, Judge Fletcher suggests that “of all the federal statutes to which\nstrict text-based rules of statutory construction might be applied, § 1981\nis a particularly inappropriate candidate” because under a plain-text read-\ning “§ 1981 should not be read to protect nonwhites [sic] against private\nracial discrimination.” Conc. Op. at 19101. Because McDonald departed\nfrom Judge Fletcher’s plain-text reading of § 1981, he reasons that we\nshould reject the plain text of § 1981 altogether and turn to unrelated,\nrepealed legislation and the pronouncement of a single congressional com-\nmittee to interpret § 1981. Id. at 19101-02. What Judge Fletcher forgets,\nhowever, is that McDonald stands for exactly the opposite proposition,\nnamely that “the language and history of § 1981” demonstrate that\n“§ 1981 is applicable to racial discrimination in private employment\nagainst white persons.” 427 U.S. at 286-87 (emphasis added). Indeed,\napplying the plain text of the statute, McDonald emphasized that, “the\nstatute explicitly applies to ‘all persons’, including white persons.” Id. at\n287 (emphasis omitted); see also id. at 287-96 (discussing the history of\n§ 1981).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19119\nsimply, as the majority holds, racial groups qua racial groups.\nSee Brown v. Henderson, 257 F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(holding that under Title VII “the ultimate issue is the rea-\nson[ ] for the individual plaintiff’s treatment, not the relative\ntreatment of different groups within the workplace”); accord\nConnecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 453-54 (1982) (“[Title\nVII’s] principal focus . . . is the protection of the individual\nemployee, rather than the protection of the minority group as\na whole.”); Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567,\n579 (1978) (stating that an employer must “provide an equal\nopportunity for each applicant regardless of race, without\nregard to whether member’s of the applicant’s race are\nalready proportionately represented in the workforce”).\n\n   This bedrock principle has its origins in the history of the\nFourteenth Amendment, from which § 1981 derives. The\nEqual Protection Clause provides in pertinent part that, “No\nState shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1\n(emphasis added). Just as courts have read Title VII and—\nuntil now—§ 1981 to protect individual rights, courts have\nconsistently held that the Equal Protection Clause “protect[s]\npersons, not groups.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). Accordingly, the Supreme Court\nhas required that “group classification[s] . . . be subjected to\ndetailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to\nequal protection of the laws has not been infringed.” Id.;\naccord Mitchell, 313 U.S. at 97 (“It is the individual . . . who\nis entitled to the equal protection of the laws,—not merely a\ngroup of individuals . . . .”); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1,\n22 (1948) (“The rights established [by the Fourteenth Amend-\nment] are personal rights.”); Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Can-\nada, 305 U.S. 337, 349-351 (1938) (similar); McCabe v.\nAtchison, Topeka, & Sante Fe Ry. Co., 235 U.S. 151, 161-62\n(1914) (similar); J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 152 (1994)\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (“The neutral phrasing\nof the Equal Protection Clause, extending its guarantee to\n‘any person,’ reveals its concern with rights of individuals,\n\f19120               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nnot groups (though group disabilities are sometimes the mech-\nanism by which the State violates the individual right in ques-\ntion).”)\n\n    This principle is manifest in one of the cornerstones of our\nmodern civil rights laws, Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1. In\nShelley, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\nbecause courts could enforce racially restrictive covenants\nequally against both whites and African Americans, enforcing\na racially restrictive covenant against African Americans in\nthat case did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at\n21-22. In so holding, Shelley reasoned that because “[t]he\nrights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual . . . [i]t is\n. . . no answer to . . . say that the courts may also be induced\nto deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on\ngrounds of race or color.” Id. at 22. Indeed, “[e]qual protec-\ntion of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate impo-\nsition of inequalities.” Id. Contrary to Shelley, the majority\nholds that equality can be achieved “through indiscriminate\nimposition of inequalities.” Id.7\n\n   As there is no reason to depart from the plain meaning of\n§ 1981 or the framework espoused in Shelley, I would follow\nSupreme Court precedent by considering the rights of individ-\nuals, not of groups. Consequently, I cannot concur in the\nmajority’s modification of the second Weber and Johnson fac-\ntor.\n\n      3.   Attaining a Balance\n\n   Finally, the majority reworks the third Weber and Johnson\nfactor, which requires that an affirmative action plan be “in-\n  7\n   The majority’s reasoning cannot be limited to the § 1981 context.\nIndeed, if equality can only be achieved through inequality, it is unclear\nwhy the majority’s rationale would not apply with equal force to employ-\nment, housing, or public schools.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19121\ntended to attain a balanced work force, not to maintain one.”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 639; accord Weber, 443 U.S. at 208\n(holding an affirmative action “plan [should be] a temporary\nmeasure[,] . . . not intended to maintain racial balance, but\nsimply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance”). Though the\nSupreme Court has not required that all affirmative action\nprograms contain an explicit end date, Johnson also holds\nthat, “Express assurance that a program is only temporary\nmay be necessary if the program actually sets aside positions\naccording to specific numbers.” 480 U.S. at 639-40. Indeed,\nin such cases, a sunset provision is “necessary both to mini-\nmize the effect of the program on other employees, and to\nensure that the plan’s goals ‘[are] not being used simply to\nachieve and maintain . . . balance.’ ” Id. at 640 (quoting\nWeber, 478 U.S. at 477-78); accord Taxman v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Twp. of Piscataway, 91 F.3d 1547, 1564 (3d Cir. 1996) (en\nbanc) (“[B]oth Weber and Johnson unequivocally provide that\nvalid affirmative action plans are temporary measures that\nseek to attain, not maintain a permanent racial . . . balance.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. granted, 521 U.S.\n1117 (1997), cert. dismissed, 522 U.S. 1010 (1997).\n\n   Under the third factor, the majority properly recognizes that\nan affirmative action “admissions policy must do no more\nthan is necessary to correct” a racial imbalance and must be\n“temporary.” Maj. Op. at 19082; accord id. at 19077. Pro-\nclaiming that “[a]n explicit or immediately foreseeable end\ndate has never been required for an affirmative action plan to\nbe valid,” Maj. Op. at 19083, however, the majority com-\npletely ignores Johnson’s suggestion that even a partial pref-\nerence should be checked by an explicit sunset provision, by\nholding that Kamehameha’s absolute preference need not\ncontain a sunset provision at all, see Maj. Op. at 19082 (hold-\ning that Kamehameha may use race as an exclusive admis-\nsions factor “so long as is necessary to remedy the current\neducational effects of past, private, and government-\nsponsored discrimination and of social and economic depriva-\ntion”); id. at 19079 (“The goal [of Kamehameha’s admissions\n\f19122            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npolicy] is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educational\nparity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii.”); see also id. at\n19082 (noting that in the last “118 years, the Schools’ admis-\nsions policy . . . has remained constant”). The majority thus\nnot only rejects Johnson but also the Court’s admonishment\nthat “race-conscious admissions policies . . . however compel-\nling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they . . .\nmust have reasonable durational limits.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n342 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted); accord\nid. (“The requirement that all race-conscious admissions pro-\ngrams have a termination point assure[s] all citizens that the\ndeviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and\nethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the\nservice of the goal of equality itself.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n   Far from placing a durational limit on Kamehameha’s use\nof race as a dispositive admissions factor, the majority actu-\nally sanctions the use of race in perpetuity. For example, since\nfew, if any, private parties will be able to correct “significant\nimbalances in educational achievement” in the entire “target\npopulation” through their own individual action, the majori-\nty’s standard effectively issues private schools a license to\nengage in perpetual racial discrimination. Because such a lim-\nitless use of race in determining admissions contravenes pre-\ncedent, the majority’s retooling of Johnson and Weber’s third\nfactor is also unsound.\n\nB.   Applying the Majority’s Standard to Kamehameha\n\n   Even if I were to agree with the majority’s modifications to\nthe Supreme Court’s Title VII standard, I could not agree with\nits application of that standard in this case.\n\n     1. A Manifest Imbalance Presently Affecting the Target\n     Population\n\n  Under the majority’s modified first factor, “to justify a\nremedial racial preference, a private school must demonstrate\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19123\nthat specific, significant imbalances in educational achieve-\nment presently affect the target population” in the relevant\ncommunity. Maj. Op. 19077. I have explained above in Part\nI.A.1. why the majority’s test is fundamentally flawed and\nconflicts with precedent. The majority’s modifications—\neliminating any focus on the schools’ own population and any\nreliance on historical practices—relieves Kamehameha of the\nburden of demonstrating its policy is limited in scope and\nduration. For the reasons I explain in the next two sections,\nKamehameha’s affirmative action program fails both inqui-\nries. Nevertheless, under the majority’s modest thesis, Kame-\nhameha’s admissions policy arguably survives the first\nrevised factor because it is clear that Native Hawaiians suffer\nfrom significant imbalances in educational achievement rela-\ntive to most other ethnic groups in Hawaii.\n\n    2. Unnecessarily Trammel the Rights of the Non-\n    Preferred Racial Group\n\n   Under the majority’s second prong, “we ask whether,\nwithin the relevant community of Hawaii, the Kamehameha\nSchools’ admissions policy unnecessarily trammels the rights\nof the non-preferred class, that is, students with no Hawaiian\nancestry or creates an absolute bar to their advancement.”\nMaj. Op. at 19080. The majority holds that Kamehameha does\nnot run afoul of this prong because: (1) “[t]he history of\nNative Hawaiians and of Kamehameha Schools has certain\nunique features that Congress has acknowledged”; (2) “noth-\ning in the record suggests that educational opportunities in\nHawaii are deficient for [non-Native Hawaiian] students”; (3)\nnon-Native Hawaiians have no “legitimate, firmly rooted\nexpectation of admission to the Schools”; and (4) “Kameha-\nmeha allows all students to apply for admission,” though\n“once the applications are received, the Schools consider the\nethnic background of the students and admit qualified chil-\ndren with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children\nwith no such ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19080-82. None of these\n\f19124                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nexplanations is sufficient to justify Kamehameha’s admissions\npolicy even under the revised standard.\n\n   For example, the majority’s first finding is irrelevant. The\nmere fact that “Congress admitted that the United States was\nresponsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monar-\nchy” and that Congress has recognized “the challenge faced\nby Native Hawaiians in the educational arena” and has urged\nKamehameha to “redouble its efforts to educate Native\nHawaiian children,” Maj. Op. at 19081 (quoting H.R. REP.\nNO. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001)), says absolutely nothing about\nwhether Kamehameha’s policy unnecessarily trammels rights\nor creates an absolute bar. Moreover, the statements the\nmajority relies on also say nothing about whether Congress\nhas ever been aware of Kamehameha’s no non-Native Hawai-\nians policy, let alone endorsed it. Indeed, it is unreasonable to\nconclude, as the majority does, that by briefly endorsing the\nschools’ larger educational goals in a committee report that\ndoes not even accompany a piece of legislation, Congress\nintended to sanction the requirements of an otherwise infirm\naffirmative action plan.8\n  8\n   Indeed, considered in total, the paragraph that the majority relies on\nprovides remarkably little support for its position:\n      The Committee has also eliminated [certain of] the Native\n      Hawaiian specific programs formerly authorized . . . . The Com-\n      mittee’s rationale for repealing these programs is the fact that\n      similar assistance is available to all students, including Native\n      Hawaiians, under [other federal] programs . . . . Unlike other\n      indigenous populations, Native Hawaiians have a trust, estab-\n      lished by the last Hawaiian princess, which exists solely to edu-\n      cate Native Hawaiian children. The Bishop Trust is currently one\n      of the largest charitable trusts in the world, valued in excess of\n      $ 10 billion, and holds approximately 8 percent of all land in the\n      State of Hawaii as well as a 10 percent share of Goldman Sachs.\n      The Committee urges the Trust to redouble its efforts to educate\n      Native Hawaiian children. The Committee also believes that\n      these children should be given the same opportunities afforded to\n      all of our children under the programs authorized in this and\n      other acts.\nH.R. REP. NO. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                      19125\n   The majority’s second finding—that non-Native Hawaiians\nhave other educational opportunities—also fails to justify the\nmajority’s holding that Kamehameha’s admissions policy\ndoes not create an absolute bar or trammel the rights of the\nnon-preferred race. In fact, as I have previously discussed, at\npp. 19116-20, supra, I believe that considering non-Native\nHawaiians’ alternatives in this way is unsound under prevail-\ning civil rights case law. But even neglecting that fact, such\nreliance is particularly problematic here. Kamehameha has an\nillustrious network of alumni and a record of success that\nexceeds that of any other school in Hawaii. The tremendous\ntrust corpus of the Bishop Foundation enables Kamehameha\nto offer this excellent education at a severely discounted\nprice; as the majority notes, the cost of educating each student\napproaches $20,000 annually, but tuition at Kamehameha is\nless than 10% of this figure, and most students receive finan-\ncial aid. See Maj. Op. at 19057-58. No other school in Hawaii\noffers the same benefits at such low cost. Thus, the majority’s\nsecond justification flies in the face of logic and cannot justify\nthe majority’s holding.\n\n  I find the majority’s next finding—that because for the last\n“118 years, the Schools’ admissions policy . . . has remained\nconstant,” non-Native Hawaiians have no “legitimate, firmly\nrooted expectation of admission to the Schools,” Maj. Op. at\n19082 (citation omitted)—to be unavailing.9 In other words,\n   9\n     Moreover, the majority ignores what Johnson actually said. The plain-\ntiff in that case was eligible for promotion but he had to compete with\nseven other applicants who could have been promoted over him. 480 U.S.\nat 638. Accordingly, he did not have a “firmly rooted expectation” in the\nposition he was denied. Id. (“[P]etitioner had no absolute entitlement to\nthe road dispatcher position. Seven of the applicants were classified as\nqualified and eligible, and the Agency Director was authorized to promote\nany of the seven. Thus, denial of the promotion unsettled no legitimate,\nfirmly rooted expectation on the part of petitioner.” (emphasis added)).\nNowhere did Johnson hold, as the majority concludes, however, that\nknowledge of a long-standing discriminatory policy justifies discrimina-\ntory decisions made pursuant to that policy.\n\f19126            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\naccording to the majority, because non-Native Hawaiians\nhave been discriminated against on the basis of their race for\na long time, they have no cause of action under § 1981. This\nview is contrary to history and logic. Perhaps more than any\nother enactments in our history, the Fourteenth Amendment\nand the civil rights acts unsettled the expectations of an entire\nnation accustomed to judging people by their race. Surely the\nschools in Runyon would have found no defense by arguing\nthat their exclusionary policies were open and notorious and\nthat African-American students had “no expectation of admis-\nsion to the Schools.” Maj. Op. at 19082. Advising non-Native\nHawaiians that they have no possibility of admission to\nKamehameha may settle their expectations, but it does not—\nfor that reason—make the policy lawful.\n\n   Lastly, the majority’s final justification for holding that\nKamehameha’s admissions policy does not unnecessarily\ntrammel rights or create an absolute bar is absolutely wrong.\nThe majority begins by noting that “[t]he Kamehameha\nSchools allow all students to apply for admission. But once\nthe applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic\nbackground of the students and admit qualified children with\nNative Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no\nsuch ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19080; accord id. at 19082-83\n(noting, “if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry\ndo not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the\nspots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools’\npolicy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate. (foot-\nnote omitted) (emphasis added)). The majority then notes, in\na bit of an understatement, that, “[b]ecause the pool of quali-\nfied potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly\noutnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native\nHawaiians generally are not admitted.” Id. at 19080. High-\nlighting the understated nature of its conclusion, the majority\nthen proceeds to drop a footnote explaining that its euphemis-\ntic phrase “generally are not admitted” means that, from 1962\nuntil 2002, Kamehameha admitted exactly one student who\nwas not of Native Hawaiian descent. Id. at 19080 n.10.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19127\n   Proceeding as if its statement that Kamehameha generally\ndoes not admit non-Native Hawaiians proves that Kamehame-\nha’s policy is not an absolute bar, the majority entirely\nneglects to mention the circumstances surrounding the admis-\nsion of that lone non-Native Hawaiian student. Because those\ncircumstances speak volumes about Kamehameha’s policy,\nhowever, they deserve an extended discussion.\n\n   In 1962, Kamehameha reversed its previous policy of\nallowing the children of faculty members to attend. Thereaf-\nter, the school did not admit a single non-Native Hawaiian\nstudent until 2002, when it admitted one non-Native Hawaiian\nstudent to its Maui campus. In response to a firestorm of pro-\ntests following that decision, Kamehameha’s trustees repeat-\nedly apologized to the Native Hawaiian community, stated\nthat the “situation” had “brought the problems with the admis-\nsions process into sharp focus,” Members of Trs. of Kameha-\nmeha Sch., Kamehameha’s Policy Will Remain, HONOLULU\nADVERTISER, July 27, 2002, and acknowledged that they had\n“screwed up major,” Rick Daysog, Angry Ohana Grills Trust-\nees, HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN, July 16, 2002. “As a result,”\nthe trustees “pledged to . . . carefully review [Kamehameha’s]\nadmissions process,” Members of Bd. of Trs. of Kamehameha\nSch., supra, presumably to prevent such a “situation” from\nhappening again.\n\n   Far from an empty promise, Kamehameha promptly made\nseveral significant changes to its admission practices. First, it\ncreated the Ho’oulu Hawaiian Data Center to develop a\nNative Hawaiian registry and certify the Hawaiian ancestry of\nthe schools’ applicants; to be considered under the school’s\npreference policy, an applicant’s ancestry must now be veri-\nfied by the data center.10 Second, Kamehameha temporarily\n  10\n    I note that in 2003, Kamehameha admitted a student to its seventh\ngrade class whose application identified his maternal grandfather as\nNative Hawaiian. One week before school was set to begin, Kamehameha\nlearned that the student’s mother was adopted and probably lacked biolog-\n\f19128                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nwaived application fees for its Maui and Big Island campuses\nin order to induce more Native Hawaiians to apply for admis-\nsion. Third, Kamehameha further increased the number of\nNative Hawaiians applying to its Big Island campus by allow-\ning certain students, who had previously only been eligible for\nadmission to its main campus in O’ahu, to apply for admis-\nsion at the Big Island campus.11 Fourth, Kamehameha also\nceased its preliminary screening for O’ahu and Big Island\napplicants.\n\n   And fifth, Kamehameha ceased using a minimum scoring\nthreshold to evaluate applicants. Since 1989, Kamehameha\nhad required applicants to achieve a minimum composite\nscore on an admissions test in order to be deemed “qualified\napplicants.” Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Standards Debated,\nHONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. Though that test\nwas hardly an impediment to the school’s preference policy—\nas 2002 marked the first time in four decades that the school\nhad space to admit a non-Native Hawaiian student—it did at\nleast provide an objective way to measure the number of qual-\nified Native Hawaiian applicants. By eliminating that test,\nhowever, Kamehameha did away with that objective measure,\nwhile leaving in place “Kamehameha Schools’ admissions\npolicy . . . to give preference to applicants of Hawaiian ances-\n\nical Hawaiian ancestry. Kamehameha immediately rescinded the student’s\nacceptance. Ultimately, Kamehameha settled the case and agreed to allow\nthe student to complete his education at Kamehameha. See David Waite,\nBoy Sues Kamehameha, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 19, 2003, at 1B;\nDavid Waite & Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Settles Kaua’i Boy’s Lawsuit,\nHONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 29, 2003, at 1A; see also Vicki Viotti &\nMike Gordon, Kamehameha Settlement OK’d, HONOLULU ADVERTISER,\nDec. 5, 2003, at 1B (stating that the district court indicated it believed that,\nlegally, the boy was Native Hawaiian).\n   11\n      Kamehameha’s flagship campus on O’ahu receives approximately ten\napplications for every available opening, so reducing its applicant pool did\nnot present the danger that the school would not receive enough qualified\nNative Hawaiian applicants.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19129\ntry to the extent permitted by law.” Kamehameha Schools\nAdmissions Office, Main Page, http://www.ksbe.edu/\nadmissions/mainpage.html (last visited Sep. 7, 2006). Thus,\nbecause that policy provides no objective guidance whatso-\never, Kamehameha’s decision leaves it free to restrict admis-\nsion solely to Native Hawaiian children, and as the trustees\npromised, Kamehameha need never admit a non-Native\nHawaiian applicant again. This description is not meant to\ncriticize Kamehameha’s noble mission to help Native Hawai-\nians receive a quality education, but only to demonstrate that\nits current policy—contrary to the majority’s creative\ncharacterization—does pose an absolute bar to the admittance\nof any non-Native Hawaiian students. And, such bar violates\nsection 1981.\n\n    3. Do No More Than Is Necessary to Correct a\n    Manifest Imbalance\n\n   Similarly, I must dissent from the majority’s analysis under\nits third prong. Under that prong, as modified by the majority,\nKamehameha’s “admissions policy must do no more than is\nnecessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by stu-\ndents of Native Hawaiian ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19082. To\nhold that Kamehameha’s admissions policy survives this fac-\ntor, the majority asserts that Kamehameha’s policy is both\nflexible and limited. Id. at 19082-83. As for the former, the\nmajority finds that Kamehameha’s admissions policy “does\nnot do more than is necessary” because that “policy is not\nfixed but changes as the capacity of the Schools’ programs\nincreases and as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian com-\nmunity rises.” Maj. Op. at 19082. The majority fails to pro-\nvide any support for that conclusion, and that lack of support\nis far from surprising given that, as demonstrated above,\nKamehameha has only made its race based admissions pro-\ngram more rigid, see supra at pp. 19127-28.\n\n  The majority also finds that Kamehameha’s admissions\npolicy is “limited in duration” by the fact that “if qualified\n\f19130               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nstudents with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the\nSchool in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as hap-\npened in one recent year, the Schools’ policy is to open\nadmissions to any qualified candidate” and the admissions\npolicy will end when “the current educational effects of past,\nprivate and government-sponsored discrimination and of\nsocial and economic deprivation” end. Maj. Op. at 19082\n(footnote omitted). Because, as the majority candidly con-\ncedes, “there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian\nancestry than there are available places at the Schools,” id. at\n19058, and Kamehemeha altered its admissions criteria in\nresponse to what “happened in one recent year,” id. at 19082,\nit is unclear whether Kamehameha will ever admit another\nnon-Native Hawaiian student, let alone end its racially exclu-\nsive admissions policy. I cannot understand how Kamehame-\nha’s policy can reasonably be described as “limited in\nduration.”12\n\n   As Kamehameha’s own trustees put it, “[Our policy] must\nremain [in place] until Hawaiians are leading in scholastic\nachievement, until they are underrepresented in prisons and\nhomeless shelters, until their well-being is restored.” Trs. of\nKamehameha Sch., Kamehameha Schools’ Policy Advocates\nSocial Justice, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 24, 2003. And,\naccording to its website, “Kamehameha Schools’ mission is to\nfulfill Pauahi’s desire to create educational opportunities in\n   12\n      Moreover, Kamehameha’s own admissions policy may help perpetu-\nate that policy indefinitely. Because Kamehameha bases its admissions\ndecisions heavily on an applicant’s prior academic performance it selects\nthe highest-performing Native Hawaiian students from the public school\npopulation, and that necessarily depresses that population’s average per-\nformance in public schools. See Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Standards\nDebated, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. By continually\npassing over the lower performers, the Native Hawaiian population will\nlikely continue to underperform in public schools relative to its peers. If\n“preference [may] be given . . . for so long as is necessary to remedy the\ncurrent educational effects,” Maj Op. at 19082, Kamehameha’s policy has\nno reasonable end in sight.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19131\nperpetuity to improve the capability and well-being of people\nof Hawaiian ancestry.” See Kamehameha Schools Admissions\nOffice,    Main      Page,   http://www.ksbe.edu/admissions/\nmainpage.html (last visited Sep. 7, 2006). Because such a per-\npetual use of race in admissions has no limit, I cannot join the\nmajority in holding that Kamehameha’s admissions policy\ndoes no more than is necessary and therefore survives the\nmodified third factor.\n\n                           *****\n\n   The Supreme Court has long warned that “[c]lassifications\nof [persons] solely on the basis of race . . . threaten to stigma-\ntize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial\ngroup and to incite racial hostility.” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n630, 643 (1993) (citations omitted). And as we have stated,\n“race-conscious programs must be designed to minimize—if\nnot avoid—burdens upon nonculpable third parties.” Coral\nConstr. Co. v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 917 (9th Cir.\n1991). Nothing in the majority’s opinion reassures me that\nKamehameha has made that effort, and I must dissent from\nthe majority’s analysis.\n\n        II.   CONGRESSIONAL EXEMPTION OF\n              KAMEHAMEHA FROM § 1981\n\n   As an additional justification for its decision, the majority\nasserts that Kamehameha’s policy does not violate § 1981\nbecause Congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for\nNative Hawaiians from § 1981’s coverage. The majority,\njoined to some extent by Judge Fletcher’s concurrence,\naccomplishes this with three premises: First, the majority rea-\nsons that because § 1981 was enacted in 1870, prior to the\nacquisition of Hawaii, “Congress could not have had any con-\nscious intention as to how [§ 1981] would apply in Hawaii.”\nMaj. Op. at 19085. Second, “Congress reenacted § 1981 in\n1991.” Id. at 19088. Third, “Congress has passed [legislation]\nspecifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before and after\n\f19132            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n1991,” and to read these acts “consistently with the revised\nversion of § 1981,” we must read an exemption for Native\nHawaiians into § 1981. Id. at 19086-87. Indeed, according to\nthe majority, this is “the most plausible reading of § 1981.”\nId. at 19089.\n\n   Each of the majority’s premises is either demonstrably\nwrong or utterly irrelevant. First, the majority’s claim that\n“Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to\nhow [§ 1981] would apply in Hawaii” is just plain wrong.\nMaj. Op. at 19085. As the majority observes, when Congress\nfirst enacted § 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1870,\nthe Hawaiian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose\npeople remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States.\nThe United States did not annex Hawaii until the 1890s. See\nMaj. Op. at 19056, 19085. It is clear, then, that Congress\ncould not have initially intended either to cover or to exempt\nNative Hawaiians from § 1981’s provisions. But nothing\nmore can be gleaned from this fact. The majority reads a dif-\nferent point into this history: That we do not know how Con-\ngress intended § 1981 to apply in Hawaii. This is nonsensical\nand flies in the face of, among other things, § 1981 itself, the\nHawaiian Statehood Act, the equal footing doctrine, and the\nSupremacy Clause.\n\n   Hawaii and its citizens have been subject to § 1981 since\nHawaii became a territory because § 1981 applies to “[a]ll\npersons with the jurisdiction of the United States,” including\n“every State and Territory.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) (2000). Con-\ngress reaffirmed this when Hawaii became a state in 1959 and\njoined the Union with all of the privileges and duties of all of\nthe other states, that is, on an “equal footing,” as if it had\njoined the Union at its founding. See Alaska v. United States,\n545 U.S. 75, ___, 125 S. Ct. 2137, 2143 (2005); United States\nv. Texas, 339 U.S. 707, 716-20 (1950). As a new state, Hawaii\nand its citizens became subject to all laws of the United\nStates, including § 1981. See U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2 (“The\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall\n\f                      DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS            19133\nbe made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law\nof the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound\nthereby . . . .”). This was made express in the Hawaiian State-\nhood Act, which provided that “the laws of the United States\nshall have the same force and effect within [Hawaii] as else-\nwhere within the United States.” Pub. L. No. 86-3, § 15, 73\nStat. 11 (1959). See also Calkin v. Cocke, 55 U.S. 227, 235-\n36 (1852); Benner v. Porter, 50 U.S. 235, 243 (1850). In other\nwords, § 1981 has long applied in Hawaii and on exactly the\nsame terms as it applies elsewhere within the United States.\n\n   Second, building from its first faulty premise, the majority\ninsists that § 1981 was “reenacted” in 1991. See Maj. Op. at\n19085 (“The 1991 amendments are . . . the only[ ] time since\nHawaii became a state that Congress has reenacted § 1981.”\n(emphasis added); id. at 19085 (“Congress . . . reenacted\n§ 1981 in 1991.”); id. at 19086-87 (“. . . the pre-1991 statu-\ntory landscape . . . informs us about what Congress had in\nmind when it reenacted § 1981”); id. at 19088 (“. . . Congress\nreenacted § 1981 in 1991.”); see also Conc. Op. at 19096 (“In\n1991, Congress revised and reenacted § 1981 . . .”); id. at\n19098 (“When Congress reenacted § 1981 . . .”). It wasn’t.\nRather, § 1981 was amended in 1991 by adding two provi-\nsions; not one word of § 1981’s original text was touched by\nthose amendments. Indeed, every word that Congress wrote in\n1870 and that was codified in 1874—and was there in 1898\nwhen Hawaii was annexed and in 1959 when Hawaii became\na state—is still there.\n\n   In 1991, Congress amended § 1981 in two respects: It codi-\nfied the Court’s holding in Runyon that § 1981 applies to dis-\ncrimination by private actors, see 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c), and it\nstatutorily overruled the Court’s holding in Patterson v.\nMcLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164 (1989), that § 1981 does\nnot extend to post-contract-formation conduct, such as the\nimposition of discriminatory working conditions, see 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(b).13 See also Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons\n  13\n    Section 1981, as amended, now reads in its entirety:\n       (a) Statement of equal rights\n\f19134               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nCo., 541 U.S. 369, 373 (2004) (“In 1991, . . . Congress\nresponded to Patterson by adding a new subsection to § 1981\nthat defines the term ‘make and enforce contracts’ to include\nthe ‘termination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits,\nprivileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relation-\nship.’ ”); H.R. REP. NO. 102-40, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. II,\nat 37 (1991) (“[Subsection (b)] overrules Patterson by adding\na new subsection to Section 1981 . . . . [Subsection (c)] is\nintended to codify Runyon v. McCrary.”). The majority does\nnot argue that either of those amendments exempted Native\nHawaiians, and the 1991 Amendments did not alter subsec-\ntion (a) (except to add the “(a)” and the heading), which con-\ntinues to state that the protections of § 1981 apply to “[a]ll\npersons within the jurisdiction of the United States.” There is\nabsolutely no indication in the 1991 amendments or their leg-\nislative history that Congress intended to exempt racial prefer-\nences for Native Hawaiians from § 1981’s broad coverage.14\n\n    All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have\n    the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce\n    contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and\n    equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of per-\n    sons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n    subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and\n    exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n    (b) “Make and enforce contracts” defined\n    For purposes of this section, the term “make and enforce con-\n    tracts” includes the making, performance, modification, and ter-\n    mination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits,\n    privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\n    (c) Protection against impairment\n      The rights protected by this section are protected against impair-\n      ment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under\n      color of State law.\n   14\n      Judge Fletcher argues that the 1991 amendments were critical because\n“[i]t was not until the 1991 amendments to § 1981 that Congress specified\nthat it intend[ed] courts to apply the statute to substantive discrimination\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19135\n   Third, the majority points to a variety of other statutes that\nCongress passed before and after 1991 which favor Native\nHawaiians. See Maj. Op. at 19086-88; see also Conc. Op. at\n19096-98. It is beyond dispute that Congress has enacted\nnumerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for\nNative Hawaiians, but nothing in those acts says anything\nabout § 1981, much less exempts Native Hawaiians from its\ncoverage. See, e.g., Hawaiian Homes Commission Act § 1 et\nseq., 42 Stat. 108 (1920) (setting aside approximately 200,000\nacres and establishing a program of loans and long-term\nleases for the benefit of Native Hawaiians); Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 103-335, 108 Stat.\n2599, 2652 (1994) (“In entering into contracts with private\nentities to carry out environmental restoration and remedia-\ntion of Kaho‘olawe Island . . . the Secretary of the Navy shall\n. . . give especial preference to businesses owned by Native\nHawaiians . . . .”); Native Hawaiian Education Act, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512(13) et seq. (2002) (establishing programs to facilitate\nthe education of Native Hawaiians and asserting a “political\nrelationship between the United States and the Native Hawai-\nian people”); Native American Graves Protection and Repatri-\nation Act, 25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq. (2002) (extending\nprotection to American Indian and Native Hawaiian burial\nsites); Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act of\n1992, 42 U.S.C. § 11701(17) et seq. (1992) (creating a num-\n\nby private actors.” Conc. Op. at 19098. It is true that Congress made clear\nin what is now 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c) that § 1981(a) applies to private enti-\nties. But in enacting that provision, Congress merely codified the Court’s\nholding in Runyon that § 1981 reached private conduct under the Thir-\nteenth Amendment. See Runyon, 427 U.S. at 168 n.8; see also Jones v.\nAlfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 423-24, 437, 440 (1968) (so holding\nwith respect to 42 U.S.C. § 1982). We never questioned, post-Runyon and\npre-1991, that § 1981 reached private conduct. See, e.g., Evans v. McKay,\n869 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Section 1981 prohibits private\nracial discrimination against white persons as well as against nonwhites.”\n(emphasis added)); Bonilla v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 697 F.2d 1297,\n1299 n.4 (9th Cir. 1982) (“[I]t is clear that Section 1981 extends to private\nconduct as well as state action . . . .”).\n\f19136            DOE v.

Take, for example, the Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments which both the majority and the concurrence\npoint to as evidence that Congress approved and exempted\nKamehameha’s admissions policy. Maj. Op. at 19087-88;\nConc. Op. at 19098. Those Amendments direct the Secretary\n\f19138               DOE v.

III, § 363, 108 Stat. 3975 (1994), and a cur-\nrent version of the act only mentions Kamehameha in the\nfindings of fact. 20 U.S.C. § 7512(16) (2002).\n\n   Judge Fletcher goes a step farther than the majority, argu-\ning that the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the Public\nHealth Service Act “specifically directed Kamehameha\nSchools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is for-\nbidden by § 1981.” Conc. Op. at 19098. I cannot see how\n“ ‘mak[ing] grants to [Kamehameha] for a demonstration pro-\n  15\n     Whether Congress appropriated money to Kamehameha has no bear-\ning on whether it thought that Kamehameha was in compliance with a\nwholly unrelated statute. It is easy to generate examples which clearly\nillustrate this: Before 2003, professors at the University of Michigan\nreceived numerous federal grants from the National Institutes of Health\nand the National Science Foundation, but this did not indicate that either\nCongress or the President believed Michigan’s admissions policy was con-\nstitutional; indeed, the Department of Justice filed amicus briefs in Gratz\nand Grutter arguing just the opposite. Similarly, no one would argue that\nCongress, by granting federal aid or favorable tax treatment to certain cor-\nporations (such as Texaco), intended to grant those corporations exemp-\ntions from federal antidiscrimination laws, cf. Smith v. Texaco, Inc., 281\nF.3d 477 (5th Cir. 2002). Nor would anyone argue that Congress, by allo-\ncating funds to state or local police departments, somehow evinces an\nintent to exempt such departments from the purview of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThese examples clearly demonstrate both the absurdity and the danger\ninherent in using such unrelated statutes to draw broad conclusions about\nCongress’s inner mind.\n\f                      DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         19139\ngram to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to\nNative Hawaiian students’ ” or “ ‘provid[ing] funds to\n[Kamehameha] for the purpose of providing scholarship assis-\ntance’ to eligible Native Hawaiian students” constitutes a spe-\ncific instruction from Congress to Kamehameha to apply a\nracially exclusive admissions policy. See Conc. Op. at 19098\n(quoting Pub. L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, § 4005(a), 102 Stat. at\n360 (formerly codified at 20 U.S.C. § 4905(a)) (repealed\n1994) and citing Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-644,\n§ 401, 104 Stat. 4662, 4668 (codified as amended at 42\nU.S.C. §254s)).16 Judge Fletcher’s conclusion is especially\nbaffling because Congress never even mentioned Kamehame-\nha’s admissions policy in either piece of legislation, including\nthe legislative history; in fact, there is nothing in the congres-\nsional materials to even suggest that Congress knew that\nKamehameha’s admissions policy was racially exclusive, let\nalone that Congress endorsed it.17\n\n  Additionally, the majority points to a House committee\nreport that “favorably mentioned the Bishop Trust and\nexhorted the Schools to ‘redouble [their] efforts to provide for\nNative Hawaiians.’ ” Maj. Op. at 19088 (quoting H.R. REP.\nNO. 107-63(I), at 333). A committee report, however, says\nnothing about how Congress as a whole views Kamehameha’s\nadmission policy. This particular report is of no legislative\nvalue whatsoever because it does not even accompany an act;\nin other words, the committee’s resolution does not even\naspire to be legislative history. Furthermore, a committee’s\n  16\n      It is also worth noting, once again, that the Hawkins-Stafford Amend-\nments have been repealed.\n   17\n      Judge Fletcher also argues that, “[i]n order to hold for plaintiff in this\ncase, we would have to conclude that, Congress intended [the 1991\namendments to § 1981] to invalidate, sub silentio, the recently enacted\nlegislation that provided loans and scholarships exclusively to Native\nHawaiians at Kamehameha Schools.” Conc. Op. at 19098. Because\n§ 1981, as set out above, has absolutely nothing to do with legislation pro-\nviding loans and scholarships to Native Hawaiians, that assertion is simply\nwrong.\n\f19140               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nmere exhortation that Kamehameha should “redouble [its]\nefforts to provide for Native Hawaiians,” id., does not, as the\nmajority’s reasoning would have it, equal legislation, duly\nenacted, that “Kamehameha may continue to provide for\nNative Hawaiians, in violation of existing civil rights laws, if\nnecessary.” In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that either\nhouse of Congress, or even any subset of its membership,\nknew about—let alone approved of—Kamehameha’s absolute\nban on non-Native Hawaiian students. Thus, the Hawkins-\nStafford Amendments and the House committee report do not\noperate as some kind of estoppel against applying generally\napplicable civil rights laws to Native Hawaiians generally or\nto Kamehameha in particular.\n\n   Finally, from this thin record, the majority concludes that\n“the most plausible” way to harmonize these acts with the “re-\nenactment” of § 1981 is to infer that “Congress intended that\na preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native\nHawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy’s\nancestral lands, be upheld.” Maj. Op. at 19089. Mere recita-\ntion of the conclusion should remind us of Justice Jackson’s\n“restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.”\nSmith v. Allright, 321 U.S. 649, 669 (1944) (Jackson, J., dis-\nsenting). In any event, there is no need to harmonize these\nstatutes because there is no inconsistency. A straightforward\nreading of § 1981 does not render any other legislation non-\nsensical, void, or superfluous. The fact that Congress has\npassed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education\nsays nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt\nNative Hawaiian schools from § 1981; there is no legislative\nconflict to reconcile.18 See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535,\n  18\n    The majority’s reliance on Runyon in this instance is misplaced. See\nMaj. Op. at 19085 (“In Runyon, for instance, the Court relied on Congress’\nenactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights legislation\nin concluding that Congress must have intended § 1981 to reach private\nacts of discrimination.”). Runyon discussed the passage of the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972 because, while considering that act,\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19141\n551 (1974) (“The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose\namong congressional enactments, and when two statutes are\ncapable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a\nclearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to\nregard each as effective.”).\n\n   Unfortunately, the majority’s reasoning reaches far beyond\nKamehameha, and in finding that Native Hawaiians prefer-\nences are exempt from § 1981, the majority holds that by\namending that statute in 1991, Congress narrowed the scope\nof one of our oldest and most enduring civil rights statutes.\nSee Maj. Op. at 19085-87 (using the enactments outlined\nabove to “interpret[ ] the scope of § 1981”). Moreover, the\nmajority’s focus on what Congress may have been thinking\nignores what Congress actually did: It passed § 1981, a non-\ndiscrimination law of general applicability. Section 1981, on\nits face, clearly does not create any exemptions for Native\nHawaiians; thus, whether or not Congress meant to create\nsuch an exemption—and again, there is absolutely no indica-\ntion that it intended to do so—it certainly did not create such\nan exception. Cf. Williams v. Babbitt, 115 F.3d 657, 660 (9th\nCir. 1997) (“Congress may well have thought that, by passing\nthe [Reindeer Industry] Act, it was effectively precluding any-\none other than natives from entering the reindeer business.\nNevertheless, nothing in the Act actually prohibits non-\nnatives from entering the Reindeer business . . . .”).\n\n   To my mind, the disparate statutes favoring Native Hawai-\nians that the majority relies on demonstrate a different point\n\nCongress specifically considered repealing § 1981 to the extent that it\napplied to racial discrimination by private employers. See 427 U.S. at 173-\n75. The Runyon Court was considering whether § 1981 applied to private\nacts of racial discrimination, and that debate provided clear evidence that\nCongress believed that § 1981 applied to contracts between private parties.\nRunyon provides no support for inferring an exception for Native Hawai-\nians in § 1981 merely because Congress has “provide[d] specifically for\ntheir welfare in a number of different contexts.” Maj. Op. at 19086.\n\f19142               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\naltogether: That when Congress wishes to give Native Hawai-\nians special treatment, it knows how to do so—and it is not\nshy about it. Cf. Malabed v. N. Slope Borough, 335 F.3d 864,\n872 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The existence of express preference pro-\ngrams created by Congress supports our conclusion . . . .\n[T]hey show that when Congress wants to authorize or require\nNative [American] hiring preferences, it knows how to do\nso.”); Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement\n& Power Dist., 154 F.3d 1117, 1123 (9th Cir. 1998) (“The\nfact that Congress now requires a narrowly defined set of con-\ntracts to honor local tribal preference policies not only fails to\nsupport the argument that it intended to accomplish that same\nobjective in 1964 when passing Title VII, but it suggests quite\nthe opposite proposition. It shows us that when Congress\nwishes to allow tribal preferences, it adopts an appropriate\namendment to the applicable statute.”); Williams, 115 F.3d at\n661 (“[T]he total and perpetual exclusion of a majority of the\npopulation . . . from a particular enterprise is the kind of sig-\nnificant feature we would normally expect Congress to spell\nout if that were its intent.”). Nothing in the statutory language\nor legislative history of § 1981 even hints that Congress\nwanted to exempt Native Hawaiian preferences from its pro-\nvisions. Finding an exemption here is beyond any accepted\nmethod of statutory interpretation.19\n  19\n     The majority’s new statutory metaphysics raises far more questions\nthan it answers: How many provisions favoring Native Hawaiians must\nCongress pass before we will imply an exemption to § 1981? Would one\nact favoring Native Hawaiians somehow establish a lower level of scrutiny\nfor Native Hawaiian preferences, and a subsequent act completely exempt\nsuch preferences—or was the exemption granted in one fell swoop? How\nmight Congress go about removing this exemption; how many acts have\nto be repealed in order to repeal this exemption? If Congress had wanted\nNative Hawaiians to be covered by § 1981, must it have expressly\nincluded them? Who else is exempted from § 1981 under the majority’s\nlogic?\n  There is no end to this game.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19143\n   If Congress wishes to exempt preferences for Native\nHawaiians from § 1981, it may do so. Until then, however, we\nought to apply the law as written. And as written, § 1981\nclearly encompasses Kamehameha’s racially exclusive admis-\nsions policy.\n\n   III.   NATIVE HAWAIIANS, MANCARI, AND THE\n          SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP DOCTRINE\n\n   Judge Fletcher raises an interesting variation on the last\nargument. Like the majority, the concurrence concludes that\nracial preferences on behalf of Native Hawaiians are exempt\nfrom § 1981. However, Judge Fletcher arrives at this result\nvia a slightly different route: First, he reasons that Native\nHawaiian status is both a political and a racial classification.\nConc. Op. at 19090 He then suggests that, under the “special\nrelationship” doctrine, Congress has given Native Hawaiians\nspecial benefits based on their political status. Id. at 19090-\n92. From that, Judge Fletcher then postulates that because\nCongress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits, it\ncould not have intended to prohibit private parties from doing\nthe exact same thing. Id. at 19094. Thus, according to the con-\ncurrence, § 1981, which prohibits racial preferences in private\ncontracts, must be read to exempt preferences on behalf of\nNative Hawaiians. Id. at 19102.\n\n   To establish his beginning premises, Judge Fletcher must\nrely on Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), which cre-\nated the “special relationship” doctrine. In Mancari, the\nSupreme Court held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs’s\n(“BIA”) hiring preference for Native Americans did not con-\nstitute racial discrimination. 417 U.S. at 553-54. Instead, the\nCourt wrote that the preference was “not directed towards a\n‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it applies only\nto members of ‘federally recognized’ tribes.” Id. at 553 n.24.\nThe Court concluded that this preference was therefore not a\nracial preference at all, but instead a political preference, and\napplied rational basis scrutiny. Id. Judge Fletcher would con-\n\f19144               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nclude that, under Mancari, Congress has the power to exempt\nprivate parties’ racial preferences in favor of Native Hawai-\nians from the purview of § 1981. Conc. Op. at 19095.\n\n   Before discussing the merits of the concurrence’s reason-\ning, I note that Kamehameha did not make this argument on\nappeal, and it was not briefed by either party. Kamehameha\ndid argue, as the majority concludes, that preferences in favor\nof Native Hawaiians are exempt from § 1981; however, it did\nnot base its argument on the special trust doctrine espoused in\nMancari. In fact, Kamehameha’s brief does not even cite Man-\ncari.20 Because arguments not made in a party’s appellate\nbrief are waived, see Blanford v. Sacramento County, 406\nF.3d 1110, 1114 n.8 (9th Cir. 2005); Paladin Assocs., Inc. v.\nMont. Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1164 (9th Cir. 2003), it is\nimproper for the court to even consider the argument raised\nby Judge Fletcher.\n\n   Nonetheless, turning to the merits, Judge Fletcher’s argu-\nment puts more weight on Mancari than it can bear. As I\nexplain in greater detail below, the exception in Mancari is an\nexceedingly narrow one, limited to preferences that are politi-\ncal not racial. Second, Mancari’s special relationship works\nonly in those cases where Congress has formally recognized\nthe sovereignty of Native American tribes. Despite opportu-\nnity to do so, Congress has never formally recognized the\nsovereignty of Native Hawaiians. Third, even if Congress had\nrecognized Native Hawaiians as a sovereign body, the special\nrelationship doctrine applies only to preferences by the federal\ngovernment or by the tribes themselves. It does not apply to\nprivate parties discriminating on the basis of tribal status;\nindeed, we have been quite clear that such private racial dis-\ncrimination remains illegal.\n  20\n    In light of the narrowness of the Mancari exception, which I discuss\nbelow, it is easy to see why Kamehameha decided that it was better off\nusing its scarce brief space and oral argument time to pursue other argu-\nments.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19145\n   First, Judge Fletcher agrees with the majority that “ ‘Native\nHawaiians’ . . . is a racial classification.” Conc. Op. at 19090;\nsee Maj. Op. at 19067 n.9. But Judge Fletcher goes one step\nfurther, suggesting that “ ‘Native Hawaiians’ is not merely a\nracial classification,” but “also a political classification.” Id.\nat 19091. If Judge Fletcher is correct, this case, from the out-\nset, does not come within the special relationship doctrine of\nMorton v. Mancari because Mancari denied the very premise\nfrom which the concurring opinion proceeds. For instance,\nMancari held that the BIA’s Native American hiring prefer-\nence “does not constitute ‘racial discrimination.’ ” 417 U.S. at\n553. “Indeed, it is not even a ‘racial’ preference.” Id. As the\nCourt explained:\n\n    The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not\n    as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of\n    quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activi-\n    ties are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion. In\n    the sense that there is no other group of people\n    favored in this manner, the legal status of the BIA is\n    truly sui generis.\n\n417 U.S. at 554 (citation omitted). Moreover, in concluding\nthat the preference was political and not racial, the Court\nrelied on the fact that the beneficiaries were members of fed-\nerally recognized tribes:\n\n    The preference is not directed towards a ‘racial’\n    group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it applies only\n    to members of ‘federally recognized tribes.’ This\n    operates to exclude many individuals who are\n    racially to be classified as ‘Indians.’ In this sense,\n    the preference is political rather than racial in nature.\n\nId. at 553 n.24 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the\nSupreme Court explained in Rice v. Cayetano, “[a]lthough the\nclassification [in Mancari] had a racial component, the Court\nfound it important that the preference was not directed\n\f19146             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntowards a racial group consisting of Indians, but rather only\nto members of federally recognized tribes. In this sense, the\nCourt held, the preference was political rather than racial in\nnature.” 528 U.S. 499, 519-20 (2000) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n   Here, Judge Fletcher agrees that, whatever else Kamehame-\nha’s admissions policy may be, it is a racial classification.\nThis fact places Kamehameha’s policy outside the scope of\nMancari’s holding. The distinction is critical, because if a\npreference for Native Hawaiians were only political and not\nracial, then § 1981, by its own terms, would not apply. No\nexemption from § 1981 would be necessary. See Sagana v.\nTenorio, 384 F.3d 731, 738 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[T]he guarantee\nthat ‘all persons’ may enjoy the same rights that ‘white citi-\nzens’ enjoy does not protect against discrimination on the\nbasis of . . . political affiliation.”); Keating v. Carey, 706 F.2d\n377, 384 (2d Cir. 1983) (“In light of the Court’s interpreta-\ntion, the legislative history, and the express language of the\nstatute, we hold that § 1981, however generously construed,\ndoes not prohibit discrimination on the basis of political affili-\nation.”).\n\n   Further, Mancari was premised on actual federal recogni-\ntion of Native American tribes. See, e.g., 417 U.S. at 542\n(emphasizing the BIA’s control over the “lives and destinies\nof the federally recognized Indian tribes”) (emphasis added);\nid. at 551 (“Resolution of the instant issue turns on the unique\nlegal status of Indian tribes under federal law and upon the\nplenary power of Congress, based on a history of treaties and\nthe assumption of a ‘guardian-ward’ status, to legislate on\nbehalf of federally recognized Indian tribes.”) (emphasis\nadded); id. at 553 n.24 (“The preference is not directed\ntowards a ‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it\napplies only to members of ‘federally recognized’ tribes.”)\n(emphasis added); see also Rice, 528 U.S. at 519-20.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        19147\n   Native Hawaiians have never been accorded formal recog-\nnition as a Native American tribe,21 and while the “special\ntrust relationship” between Congress and Native Hawaiians\nbears many similarities to the relationship between Congress\nand Native American tribes, the two relationships are not\nidentical. And, as we recently acknowledged, “absent federal\nrecognition, tribes do not enjoy the same status, rights, and\nprivileges     accorded     federally     recognized     tribes.”\nKahawaiolaa v. Norton, 386 F.3d 1271, 1273 n.1 (9th Cir.\n2004). In fact, Congress has passed many statutes benefitting\nNative American tribes that do not include Native Hawaiians,\nor which distinguish them from Native American tribes. See,\ne.g., Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,\n25 U.S.C. § 450 et seq. (2000) (defining an “Indian” as “a\nperson who is a member of [a federally recognized] Indian\ntribe”); 25 U.S.C. § 3001(9), (10) (2000) (defining Native\nAmerican as “of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture that\nis indigenous to the United States” and Native Hawaiian, by\ncontrast, as “any individual who is a descendant of the aborig-\ninal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sover-\neignty in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii.”);\nsee also Kahawaiolaa, 386 F.3d at 1282 (“[F]ederal benefits\nand entitlements for native Hawaiians [are] different from\n[those] afforded federally recognized Indian tribes . . . .”); id.\n(“Congress, because of the unique history of Hawaii, has\nexcluded [Native Hawaiians] from some statutes . . . .”); id.\n(“[M]any statutes distinguish between native Hawaiians and\nmembers of Indian tribes.”).\n  21\n     There is currently legislation in Congress—part of an ongoing effort\n—to extend formal recognition to Native Hawaiians. See S. 147, 109th\nCong. (2005); H.R. 309, 109th Cong. (2005). Neither house has taken any\naction to date. Even if it were passed, however, there is cause to question\nwhether such an act would be within Congress’s constitutional power. See\nRice, 528 U.S. at 519 (“It is a matter of some dispute . . . whether Con-\ngress may treat the native Hawaiians as it does the Indian tribes.”). I\ndecline to decide this question here; thus, I will prospectively assume that\nCongress has the power to formally recognize Native Hawaiians and to\ntreat them as any other federally recognized tribe.\n\f19148               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   We cannot usurp Congress’s power to grant or not grant\nformal recognition to Native Hawaiians by simply declaring\nthat the “comparable” status of Native Hawaiians, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512(12)(D), gives them tribal status. Congress has created\na discrete process for recognizing Indian tribes as tribes. See\nIndian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 461 et seq.; see also\n25 C.F.R. § 83.1 et seq. (1994) (Department of Interior regu-\nlations). Formal recognition as a tribe comes with a bundle of\nprivileges, including self-government, tribal courts, control of\nIndian lands, and the power to tax. See, e.g., Merrion v.\nJicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982); Montana v.\nUnited States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981); Santa Clara Pueblo v.\nMartinez, 436 U.S. 49 (1978). None of these privileges have\nyet been afforded to Native Hawaiians, a judgment we\nrecently upheld in Kahawaiolaa v. Norton. As we concluded\nthere, “in the end, we must commit this question to Congress\nto apply its wisdom in deciding whether or not native Hawai-\nians should be included among those eligible to apply for fed-\neral tribal recognition.” 386 F.3d at 1283.22\n  22\n     Judge Fletcher’s concurrence cites two cases decided after Mancari\nwhich, he argues, eliminated the requirement for federal recognition:\nUnited States v. John, 437 U.S. 634 (1978), and Delaware Tribal Business\nCommittee v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73 (1977). See Conc. Op. at 19092-93. I\ndisagree with the characterization of these cases. The first case, John, for\nexample, did not even involve a Mancari issue but concerned whether cer-\ntain lands constituted “Indian country” for purpose of the Major Crimes\nAct. See 18 U.S.C. § 1151; see also John, 437 U.S. at 635, 647-50. More-\nover, because the tribe involved in John had been accorded federal recog-\nnition, reliance on that case to demonstrate that federal recognition is not\nnecessary for the Mancari doctrine to apply is inapposite. Id. at 650. Simi-\nlarly, Judge Fletcher’s reliance on Weeks is misplaced. In Weeks, the\nSupreme Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to Con-\ngress’s decision not to include the descendants of members of a recog-\nnized tribe who had voluntarily renounced their status in exchange for\nUnited States citizenship from a compensation scheme that benefitted the\ndescendants of tribal members who had renounced their tribal status. The\nopinion cites Mancari, but not for reasons important to the holding of\neither case. See 430 U.S. at 84, 85. Neither John nor Weeks modified Man-\ncari’s holding, either explicitly or implicitly.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                      19149\n   Finally, even if Congress had formally recognized Native\nHawaiians, Mancari’s special status doctrine would still not\nbenefit Kamehameha because that doctrine does not apply to\nprivate parties. Mancari approved a Native American hiring\npreference adopted by the BIA because of the tribes’ capacity\nas “quasi-sovereign[s].” Mancari, 417 U.S. at 554; see also\nIowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9, 14 (1987); Fisher\nv. Dist. Ct., 424 U.S. 382, 390-91 (1976). The “special rela-\ntionship” recognized in Mancari was a sovereign-to-sovereign\nrelationship that Congress has the power to regulate by virtue\nof the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3,\nand the Treaty Clause, id. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, which “has often\nbeen the source of the Government’s power to deal with the\nIndian tribes.” Mancari, 417 U.S. at 552; see also United\nStates v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 200 (2004). Thus, private parties\nmay not seek refuge in Mancari’s special relationship doc-\ntrine. Kamehameha—despite the strong loyalty of Native\nHawaiians—is a private school established by a private trust,\nand not a recognized means of Native Hawaiian self-\ngovernment.\n\n  Judge Fletcher’s concurrence misses this point entirely\nwhen it asserts that “Congress may, if it wishes, permit Kame-\nhameha Schools to give preferential admission treatment to\nNative Hawaiians.” Conc. Op. at 19095.23 Judge Fletcher does\n  23\n     Judge Fletcher has it backwards. He cites the same body of laws—the\ncollection of different preferences for Native Hawaiians—as evidence that\nCongress both implicitly created a special relationship with Native Hawai-\nians and implicitly exempted them from § 1981. But Judge Fletcher’s\nanalogy to Native Americans is flawed: Congress has expressly created a\nspecial relationship with Native Americans by formally recognizing the\ntribes.\n   This makes a difference. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have held that\nNative American tribal entities are implicitly exempt from some suits\nunder § 1981. But those courts reasoned that because tribes are expressly\nexempted from disparate impact suits under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b); id. § 2000e-2, plaintiffs may not circumvent Title VII’s\nexemption by suing under § 1981. See Taylor v. Alabama Intertribal\n\f19150              DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nnot cite a single case where a court has upheld a private pref-\nerence for Native American tribal members under the special\nrelationship doctrine. In fact, we have soundly rejected\nexactly that argument. In Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project\nAgricultural Improvement and Power District, 154 F.3d 1117\n(9th Cir. 1998), pursuant to an agreement with the Navajo\nTribe, an Arizona corporation sought to discriminate in\nemployment by favoring members of the Navajo Tribe.\nDawavendewa, a member of the Hopi Tribe, filed a Title VII\nclaim alleging national origin discrimination. The defendants\nargued that, based on Mancari, “preferences based on tribal\naffiliation are based on political affiliation rather than national\norigin and are thus outside the realm of Title VII.” Id. at 1120.\nCiting “the unique interest the [BIA] had in employing Native\nAmericans,” that had led the Court to recognize a limited\nexception for Congress, we held that the plaintiff had alleged\na violation of Title VII. Id. at 1120.\n\n   We have even rejected attempts to extend Mancari’s excep-\ntion to other governmental entities. In Malabed v. North Slope\nBorough, 335 F.3d 864 (9th Cir. 2003), a local government\nadopted an ordinance that gave an employment preference to\nNative Americans, defined as members of federally recog-\nnized Indian tribes. Plaintiffs challenged the ordinance under\nthe equal protection guarantee of the Alaska Constitution. The\nBorough attempted to justify its ordinance by relying on Man-\ncari. Citing Rice, we limited Mancari’s political exception to\nCongress’s dealings with federally recognized Native Ameri-\ncan tribes and invalidated the ordinance. See id. at 865 n.5\n(“Mancari held only that when Congress acts to fulfill its\nunique trust responsibilities toward Indian tribes, such legisla-\n\nCouncil Title IV J.T.P.A., 261 F.3d 1032, 1034-35 (11th Cir. 2001);\nWardle v. Ute Indian Tribe, 623 F.2d 670, 672 (10th Cir. 1980). Unlike\nthe tribes, Native Hawaiians are not expressly exempted from Title VII,\nalthough there may be reason to wonder whether the majority’s opinion\nimplicitly exempts them.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19151\ntion is not based on a suspect classification.” (emphasis\nadded)). Other courts have taken a similar approach. See, e.g.,\nTafoya v. City of Albuquerque, 751 F. Supp. 1527, 1530\n(D.N.M. 1990) (“As the Supreme Court so clearly stated in\nMorton, Congress’ obligations to Indians are constitutionally\nbased and unique. The City of Albuquerque does not have\ncomparable power to treat members of federally recognized\nIndian tribes or pueblos or members of the Navajo Nation dif-\nferently than other groups of Indians or non-Indians.”); id. at\n1531 (“The Albuquerque City Council has considerably less\npower than the United States Congress to pass law discrimi-\nnating in favor of members of federally recognized Indian\ntribes and pueblos. In this respect, the rationale in Morton is\ninapplicable to this case.”); see also Rice, 528 U.S. at 520,\n522 (refusing to extend Mancari to state elections privileging\nNative Hawaiians; “the elections for OHA trustee are elec-\ntions of the State, not a separate quasi sovereign”).\n\n   Mancari may not even extend to Native American prefer-\nences in hiring by other federal agencies. The Court’s holding\nin Mancari relied on the fact that “the preference applies only\nto employment in the Indian service,” an agency that the\nCourt described as “sui generis.” 417 U.S. at 554. The Court\nspecifically did not “consider the obviously more difficult\nquestion that would be presented by a blanket exemption for\nIndians from all civil service examinations.” Id.; see also\nRice, 528 U.S. at 520 (noting “that [Mancari] was confined\nto the authority of the BIA, an agency described as ‘sui\ngeneris’ ”); Dawavendewa, 154 F.3d at 1120 (similar). We\nhave previously limited the scope of Mancari in this fashion.\nIn Williams v. Babbitt, 115 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 1997), for\nexample, we considered whether the Reindeer Industry Act\nlimited ownership of reindeer to Native Alaskans and whether\nsuch a limitation would be constitutional. The Act’s defenders\nattempted to justify it under the Court’s holding in Mancari.\nWe rejected this argument, holding that the power granted\nCongress under Mancari’s exception was of a far narrower\nscope. See id. at 664 (“The preference at issue in Mancari\n\f19152            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nonly applied to the BIA, an agency created for the purpose of\nserving Indians.”); id. at 664-65 (“[W]e can discern Man-\ncari’s scope by looking to the cases it cited as examples of\npermissible special treatment for Indians. Each case dealt with\nlife in the immediate vicinity of Indian land.” (citations omit-\nted)); id. at 655 (“While Mancari is not necessarily limited to\nstatutes that give special treatment to Indians on Indian land,\nwe do read it as shielding only those statutes that affect\nuniquely Indian interests.”); id. (“[W]e seriously doubt that\nCongress could give Indians a complete monopoly on the\ncasino industry or on Space Shuttle contracts.”).\n\n   In sum, Mancari does not support Judge Fletcher’s claim\nthat Kamehameha’s admissions policy is justified because it\nis both a racial and political classification. Judge Fletcher’s\nrationale would render Mancari unrecognizable. Indeed, as\nwith the exclusive Native Hawaiian voting scheme rejected by\nthe Supreme Court in Rice, if Kamehameha’s racially exclu-\nsive admissions policy “were to be sustained under Mancari\nwe would be required to accept some beginning premises not\nyet established in our case law . . . . These propositions would\nraise questions of considerable moment and difficulty.” 528\nU.S. at 518.\n\n                    IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n   As noble as Kamehameha’s goals may be, I cannot recon-\ncile its admissions preference—a racially exclusive policy\nthat operates as a complete bar to all applicants who are not\nof the preferred race—with the Supreme Court’s requirements\nfor a valid affirmative action plan. I cannot reconcile Kame-\nhameha’s admissions policy with the plain commands of\n§ 1981, nor can I find any evidence whatsoever that Congress\nexempted Kamehameha from § 1981 altogether. The majority\nexempts an organization with noble goals that seeks to rem-\nedy a significant problem in a community that is in great\nneed, but it can do so only because the majority departs from\nclear principles and established precedent.\n\f                   DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19153\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nRYMER, Circuit Judge, with whom KOZINSKI,\nO’SCANNLAIN, TALLMAN and CALLAHAN, Circuit\nJudges, join, dissenting:\n\n  This is altogether infelicitous.\n\n   On the one hand, the Kamehameha Schools is a well-\nrecognized, widely- acclaimed private school, established\nbefore Hawaii became a state, whose primary mission has\nbeen to educate Native Hawaiian students in a culturally sen-\nsitive, challenging way. It receives no federal funds and does\nnot operate for profit. Its purpose of providing meaningful\naccess to educational opportunity is intuitively salutary. On\nthe other hand, the admissions policy of the Kamehameha\nSchools prefers students of Native Hawaiian ancestry in such\na way that, as a practical matter, non-Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents are precluded.\n\n   The question is whether Kamehameha’s admissions policy\nviolates 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Section 1981 was originally\nenacted as part of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and confers on\n“[a]ll persons . . . the same right in every State . . . to make\nand enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .”\n\n   We do not write on a clean slate, otherwise I would ques-\ntion how a statute that accords to all persons the same right\nto contract as is enjoyed by white citizens can mean the same\nright to contract as is enjoyed by Native Hawaiians. Yet it\nwas held long ago that § 1981 applies to persons of any race,\nMcDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273\n(1976), and more recently, that Native Hawaiian ancestry can\nbe a proxy for race, Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 514 (2000).1\n  1\n   See also Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604 (1987)\n(holding that § 1981 protects against discrimination based on ancestry).\n\f19154                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nLikewise, I would have difficulty understanding how § 1981\napplies to a purely private, philanthropically-endowed, non-\nprofit educational institution. However, it was also held long\nago that § 1981 applies to private transactions, Tillman v.\nWheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., 410 U.S. 431, 440 (1973),\nincluding to contracts for educational services,2 Runyon v.\nMcCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976).3 But see Jones v. Alfred H.\nMayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 449-76 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissent-\ning from application of the similarly-worded 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1982 to private discrimination in the sale or rental of prop-\nerty); Runyon, 427 U.S. at 192-214 (White, J., dissenting).\nFinally, because education is the greatest inheritance of all, I\nhave difficulty understanding what business it is of the federal\ngovernment to tell a Native Hawaiian that she can’t choose to\nhelp other Native Hawaiians whom she believes particularly\nneed it.\n\n   This said, I am not persuaded that precedent allows the\nKamehameha Schools to justify its preferential admissions\npolicy on the footing that the policy redresses past societal\ndiscrimination against Native Hawaiians. The majority and\ndissenting opinions agree that we are guided by Title VII stan-\ndards.4 I agree with Judge Bybee that when, as here, a volun-\n   2\n     Neither party discusses whether the right to “contract” is implicated by\nthe kind of subsidized educational opportunity offered by the Kameha-\nmeha Schools. Cf. Runyon, 427 U.S. at 172 (noting that the private, com-\nmercially operated schools being sued there for excluding qualified\nchildren solely because they were black would have received payments for\nservices rendered, and the prospective students would have received\ninstruction in return for those payments).\n   3\n     The Court noted both points — that § 1981 applies to any race and to\na contract for educational services — in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244,\n276 n.23 (2003) (citing McDonald and Runyon with apparent approval).\n   4\n     See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 186-87 (1989)\n(embracing Title VII framework in § 1981 case). But see Grutter v. Bol-\nlinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003) (observing that “the prohibition against\ndiscrimination in § 1981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection\nClause), and Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23 (noting that “purposeful discrim-\nination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment will also violate § 1981”).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19155\ntary, private, affirmative action plan is at issue, the test is\nwhether it eliminates a manifest racial imbalance, does not\nunnecessarily trammel the rights of non-preferred groups or\ncreate an absolute bar to their advancement, and makes\nadjustments that do no more than necessary to obtain a racial\nbalance. United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S.\n193, 208-09 (1979); see Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 F.3d 506,\n521 (9th Cir. 2002) (breaking the Weber standard into these\nthree factors).\n\n   Obviously, the Kamehameha Schools itself has never dis-\ncriminated against Native Hawaiians; it is dedicated to serv-\ning them. Thus, the articulated justification for its race-based\nadmissions policy is to remedy external discrimination, not\ninternal imbalance. Even if a private educational enterprise\nhas more wiggle room in defining its core mission in a race-\nconscious way than a private employer, to legitimate a race-\nbased policy solely on account of discrimination by others is\nto put no bounds on it at all. To do so would render meaning-\nless the factors that influenced the Supreme Court in Weber\nto approve a voluntary, private, affirmative action plan. 443\nU.S. at 208-09. A private entity’s progress toward achieving\n“balance” cannot realistically be assessed if measured against\nsociety as a whole rather than its own work force or its own\nstudent body. But, even if a private party should be able to\nassume a public responsibility for remediation of past societal\ndiscrimination, the acceptable goal of a race-conscious admis-\nsions policy for a public educational institution is to achieve\na diverse student body. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 325 (endorsing\nthe view that student body diversity is a compelling state\ninterest that can justify the use of race in public university\nadmissions). The purpose of Kamehameha Schools and its\nadmissions policy is, of course, just the opposite. That, in a\nnutshell, is why I feel bound to reverse.\n\n  Beyond this, I agree with Judge Bybee that Congressional\napplause for programs that benefit Native Hawaiians neither\nconnotes approval of an exclusionary admissions policy based\n\f19156                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\non racial preference, nor grafts an exception onto § 1981. I\nalso agree that Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), does\nnot save the Kamehameha policy. Mancari involved a federal\nemployment preference for persons of tribal ancestry that the\nCourt upheld against a Fifth Amendment challenge because\ntribes, which are federally-recognized, are a political, rather\nthan a racial, classification. 417 U.S. at 553-55. However, the\nCourt has since declined to extend Mancari to an Hawaii stat-\nutory scheme that restricted voting for certain state officials\nto those of Native Hawaiian ancestry. Rice, 528 U.S. at 518-\n23.\n\n   As no other basis appears for affirming, I would reverse.\n\n\n\nKLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges KOZINSKI\nand O’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:\n\n  I agree in large part with Judge Bybee’s dissent and join in\nParts II and III. His analysis of the majority and concurring\nopinions is in my view correct.\n\n   I write separately because I do not agree with Judge\nBybee’s view that Title VII provides the standard of review\nin this case. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment.1\nThis case does not involve employment. Title VII has nothing\n  1\n    See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment prac-\ntice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\nvidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because\nof such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (2) to\nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment\nin any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.”).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19157\nto do with exclusion of students from schools because of race.\nNor is there a need to mine Title VII for some sort of analogy.2\n\n   The recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions about affirmative\naction, Grutter3 and Gratz,4 also have nothing to do with this\ncase. Those cases involved whether racial discrimination by\npublic schools under affirmative action plans violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This\ncase does not involve a public school or state action, so Grut-\nter, Gratz, and the Equal Protection Clause do not come into\nthe analysis.\n\n   We are not free to treat Hawaiian ancestry as a political\nrather than racial designation under Morton v. Mancari5\nbecause the Supreme Court held in Rice v. Cayetano that\nHawaiian ancestry is a “racial classification.”6 If Congress\nchooses to define persons of Native Hawaiian ancestry as\nIndians under 25 U.S.C. § 479 or some other provision, per-\nhaps it can.7 But it has not.\n\n   This case is considerably simpler. In practice, Kameha-\nmeha Schools excludes students who do not have Native\nHawaiian ancestry. The Kamehameha Schools are admirable\nin many ways, and there are good historical and social reasons\nwhy reasonable people might want to follow just such a pol-\nicy. But we are not free to make a social judgment about what\nis best for Hawaiians. We are stuck with a case that is before\nus in our capacity as judges and we have to follow the law.\n  2\n     Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164 (1989), speaks to\nboth Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Because Patterson was an employ-\nment case covered in part by each statute, it does not speak to exclusion\nfrom a private school by reason of race.\n   3\n     Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003).\n   4\n     Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).\n   5\n     417 U.S. 535 (1974).\n   6\n     Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 522 (2000).\n   7\n     See Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 519 (2000).\n\f19158              DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   The law we have to follow was laid down by the Supreme\nCourt in Runyon v. McCrary.8 Runyon holds that the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, prohibits a private\nschool from denying admission to prospective students\nbecause of their race.9 It might have been thought that Runyon\nprohibited discrimination only against black people, but we\nare not free to interpret it that way. In McDonald v. Santa Fe\nTrail Transportation, the Supreme Court decided that the stat-\nute construed in Runyon, 42 U.S.C. §1981, protects whites as\nwell as non-whites from discrimination.10 A fortiori it protects\nall the ethnic groups in Hawaii: blacks, Filipino-Americans,\nJapanese-Americans,         American      Samoans,     Chinese-\nAmericans, and all the others, regardless of their ancestry.\n\n  In my view, that is the end of the analysis. I might have\npreferred to avoid deciding this case, if some jurisdictional\ndefect existed. But we do have jurisdiction. Employment law,\nIndian law, our admiration for Kamehameha Schools, and our\nsentiments about public policy are irrelevant.\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nKOZINSKI, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I join all three of my dissenting colleagues. Judges Rymer,\nKleinfeld and Bybee have catalogued eloquently the many\nreasons why neither the majority nor the concurrence reflects\nwhat the law is, or should be, and there’s nothing I can add\non that score.\n\n  I write only to point out that the issue we are called on to\ndecide may be a problem of the schools’ own making. Runyon\n  8\n   427 U.S. 160 (1976).\n  9\n   Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 172-73 (1976).\n  10\n     McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976).\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19159\nv. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 172-73 (1976), and McDonald v.\nSanta Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 295-96\n(1976), prohibit private racial discrimination in the making\nand enforcing of contracts. The provision is implicated here\nbecause the schools charge tuition and must therefore enter\ninto a contractual relationship with each student. I don’t\nbelieve section 1981 would apply at all if the schools were\nrun entirely as a philanthropic enterprise and allowed students\nto attend for free. In Runyon, “the racial exclusion practiced\nby the [schools] amount[ed] to a classic violation of § 1981,”\nbecause “[t]he parents . . . sought to enter into contractual\nrelationships with [the schools] for educational services.” 427\nU.S. at 172. The Court emphasized the commercial nature of\nthe relationship: “Under those contractual relationships, the\nschools would have received payments for services rendered,\nand the prospective students would have received instruction\nin return for those payments.” Id. I have found no case where\nsection 1981 has been applied to a charity. Were the schools\nto forego charging tuition, their relationship to their students\nwould probably not be deemed “contractual” as that term is\nused in section 1981 and Runyon.\n\n   Being able to charge tuition is, of course, not inconsequen-\ntial. For most private schools it is a make-or-break proposi-\ntion. But it may not be so for the Kamehameha Schools,\nwhich were set up primarily as eleemosynary institutions. The\ntuition they charge reflects only a small fraction of their oper-\nating costs and, even then, most students pay a reduced\ntuition, or no tuition at all. See maj. op. at 19057-58. The\nschools’ substantial endowment may enable them to continue\noperating without charging any tuition for a very long time—\nperhaps indefinitely.\n\n   Given the scores of pages we have written on both sides of\nthis issue, it should be clear that the question is close and ours\nmay not be the last word. Given the passions this case has\naroused, see maj. op. at 19064 n.6, it’s worth noting that\nwhat’s really at stake may not be the operation of the Kame-\n\f19160           DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nhameha Schools along their traditional (preferential) model,\nbut merely a few million dollars a year the schools now get\nfrom their own students.\n\f",

The immediate result of that first encounter\nwas that Native Hawaiians were introduced to Western goods\nand Western diseases. “By 1919, the Native Hawaiian popula-\ntion had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an\nalarming 22,600.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(7).

The United States officially\nrecognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1826\nand, from 1843 until 1893, extended full diplomatic recogni-\ntion to the islands. Other countries, too—including Great Brit-\nain, France, and Japan—recognized the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(1). Before 1893, the United States entered\ninto a number of treaties for peace, friendship, and commerce\nwith the Kingdom.

The first treaty was signed in 1826, and additional\ntreaties were signed in 1849, 1875, and 1887. See Rice, 528\nU.S. at 504 (discussing the history of diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii before\nthe overthrow of the monarchy).\n\n   The Kingdom of Hawaii, located along shipping and fish-\ning routes, was commercially desirable. Initially, trade with\nthe Kingdom of Hawaii revolved around the islands’ fur and\nsandalwood resources, as well as the whaling industry. Rights\nHandbook at 5. When over-harvesting destroyed the sandal-\nwood trade and depleted the whaling stocks, wealthy West-\nerners turned to large-scale plantations, primarily growing\nsugar, to make money. Id. As foreign investment became\nmore and more tied to land ownership, demand for change in\n\f19056             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nthe traditional land tenure system, which did not provide for\nindividual land titles, intensified. Id. at 6. Pressure from West-\nerners eventually led the Hawaiian government to reject the\nland tenure system in favor of privatized land ownership,\nwhich allowed Westerners “[w]ith a permanent population of\nfewer than two thousand” to take “over most of Hawaii’s land\nin the next half-century and manipulate[ ] the economy for\ntheir own profit.” Neil M.

Id. at\n861. “In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally rec-\nognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom\nof Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-\nHawaiians, including United States citizens, who were\nassisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United\nStates naval representative, and armed naval forces of the\nUnited States.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(5). The United States\nannexed Hawaii not long thereafter. Id. § 7512(6). Laws were\nthen enacted suppressing the Hawaiian culture and language\nand allowing for the displacement of Native Hawaiians from\ntheir lands. From 1896 to 1986, almost a full century, the\nHawaiian language was banned as a medium of instruction in\nschools. Id. § 7512(19).

The Kamehameha Schools\n\n   The Kamehameha Schools were created under a “charitable\ntestamentary trust established by the last direct descendent of\nKing Kamehameha I, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who\nleft her property in trust for a school dedicated to the educa-\ntion and upbringing of Native Hawaiians.” Burgert v. Loke-\nlani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767261\"><a href=\"/opinion/767261/elizabeth-simeona-burgert-an-individual-and-francine-dawson-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 (9th Cir.\n2000). Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop’s will provided for the\nerection and maintenance of schools in the Hawaiian Islands,\ncalled the Kamehameha Schools, on the Hawaiian monar-\nchy’s ancestral lands, with the purpose of providing “a good\neducation in the common English branches, and also instruc-\ntion in morals and in such useful knowledge as may tend to\nmake good and industrious men and women.” Will of Bernice\nPauahi Bishop, reprinted in Wills and Deeds of Trust 17-18\n(3d ed. 1957) (hereinafter “Pauahi Bishop Will”). The Pauahi\nBishop Will also bestowed on the “trustees full power to\nmake all such rules and regulations as they may deem neces-\nsary for the government of said schools and to regulate the\nadmission of pupils.” Id. at 18.\n\n   Under the direction of the original trustees, chaired by\nPauahi Bishop’s widower, Charles Reed Bishop, the Kameha-\nmeha Schools opened in the late nineteenth century.3 During\na speech on the Schools’ first Founder’s Day, in December\n1888, Charles Reed Bishop stated that Princess Bernice\nPauahi Bishop had created the Kamehameha Schools, “in\nwhich Hawaiians have the preference,” so that “her own peo-\nple” could once again thrive. Charles R. Bishop, The Purpose\nof the Schools, Handicraft, Jan. 1889, at 3.\n\n  In 1910, not long after the death of Princess Bernice Pauahi\n  3\n    The Pauahi Bishop Will established two separate schools, one for boys\nand one for girls. The boys’ school opened in 1887 and the girls’ school\nin 1894. During the 1965-1966 school year, the two schools were consoli-\ndated.\n\f19058            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nBishop and the creation of the Kamehameha Schools, the\nquestion arose as to who should be admitted to the Schools.\nCobey Black & Kathleen Mellen, Princess Pauahi Bishop\nand Her Legacy 155 (The Kamehameha Schools Press 1965).\nCharles Bishop wrote to the trustees: “Mrs. Bishop intended\nthat, in the advantages of her beneficence, those of her race\nshould have preference.” Id. Accordingly, he concluded that\nthe principal of the Schools was justified in refusing to admit\na student who had no native Hawaiian ancestry. Id. Bishop\nwent on to convey that only if Native Hawaiians failed to\napply to the Schools, or if conditions changed fundamentally,\nshould admissions be opened to other ethnicities: “It was wise\nto prepare for and to admit natives only and I do not think the\ntime has come to depart from that rule.” Id.\n\n   Today, the Kamehameha Schools operate three K-12 cam-\npuses: Kapalama on the island of Oahu, Pukalani on the\nisland of Maui, and Keaau on the island of Hawaii. There are\nabout 70,000 school-aged children in Hawaii who meet the\nSchools’ definition of Native Hawaiian, but the Schools’ total\nenrollment is only about 4,856 students. The Kamehameha\nSchools subsidize much of the tuition cost for all students,\nrequiring payment of only $1,784 per year, whereas the cost\nof educating a student amounts to about $20,000 annually.\nSixty-five percent of those enrolled receive some form of\nfinancial aid to help them pay even that heavily subsidized,\nmodest tuition.\n\n   Part of the Kamehameha Schools’ stated admissions policy\nis to give preference to students of Native Hawaiian ancestry,\ndefined to include any person descended from the aboriginal\npeople who exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands\nprior to 1778. Practically, the policy operates to admit stu-\ndents without any Hawaiian ancestry only after all qualified\napplicants with such ancestry have been admitted. Because\nthere are many more qualified students of Hawaiian ancestry\nthan there are available places at the Schools, it is very rare\nthat a student with no Hawaiian ancestry is admitted to the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19059\ncampus programs. But the admissions policy is not an abso-\nlute bar to non-Native Hawaiians; instead, it is intended to last\nonly for so long as Native Hawaiians suffer educational disad-\nvantages.\n\n   We pause to note that the Schools’ policy contains no\nrequirement for a minimum blood quantum of Hawaiian\nancestry. The only requirement is that a student have at least\none Native Hawaiian ancestor. Most students have mixed\nancestry. More than 60 different racial and ethnic groups have\nbeen represented in the student body, and for the 2000-2001\nacademic year, students reported belonging to 39 different\nracial and ethnic groups. Accordingly, an observer visiting the\nSchools would see visible diversity notwithstanding the stu-\ndents’ commonality of having at least one Native Hawaiian\nancestor.\n\n  The Kamehameha Schools follow a “Leadership Model” of\neducation. This curriculum is meant to foster the self-esteem\nand self-identity of students as individuals of Native Hawaiian\ndescent by teaching Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, lan-\nguage, and tradition, in addition to general college-\npreparatory courses.\n\n   Kamehameha Schools also operate a number of other edu-\ncational programs, including pre-schools, enrichment pro-\ngrams, and summer school programs. In those programs, the\nadmission of non-Native Hawaiians occurs more often. For\nexample, for the 2001-2002 school year, 13 children with no\nNative Hawaiian ancestry were admitted to Kamehameha’s\npre-school program (two of the children declined admission);\nthe following school year 12 non-Native Hawaiian children\nwere admitted to the pre-school; and the year after that—the\n2003-2004 school year—16 students without Native Hawaiian\nancestry were admitted. And, in the summer of 2003, for\ninstance, non-Native Hawaiians were enrolled in several of\nthe enrichment programs run by the Kamehameha Schools: 6\nof 133 students in the Performing Arts Academy; 33 of 1,741\n\f19060            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nstudents in Explorations; 5 of 18 students in Culinary Arts;\nand 4 of 164 students in Hoolauna Keauhou.\n\n    3. Current Conditions in the Educational Status of\n    Native Hawaiians\n\n   Although the Kamehameha Schools are partly responsible\nfor the Native Hawaiian community’s ability to maintain “its\ndistinct character as an aboriginal, native people,” Native\nHawaiians, nonetheless, continue to face “economic depriva-\ntion, low educational attainment, poor health status, substan-\ndard housing and social dislocation.” From Mauka to Makai\nat 2. In particular, Native Hawaiians have traditionally per-\nformed much below national averages in the educational\narena.\n\n       In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Educa-\n    tion to submit to Congress a comprehensive report\n    on Native Hawaiian education. The report, entitled\n    the “Native Hawaiian Educational Assessment Proj-\n    ect,” was released in 1983 and documented that\n    Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard to\n    national norms on standardized achievement tests,\n    were disproportionately represented in many nega-\n    tive social and physical statistics indicative of spe-\n    cial educational needs, and had educational needs\n    that were related to their unique cultural situation,\n    such as different learning styles and low self-image.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(14).\n\n   That trend continues today. In 2002, Congress recognized\nthat Native Hawaiians are severely disadvantaged in educa-\ntion. It found that:\n\n      (A) educational risk factors continue to start even\n    before birth from many Native Hawaiian children[;]\n    ...\n\f            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS              19061\n   (B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin\ntheir school experience lagging behind other students\nin terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test\nscores;\n\n  (C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score\nbelow national norms on standardized education\nachievement tests at all grade levels;\n\n   (D) both public and private schools continue to\nshow a pattern of lower percentages of Native\nHawaiian students in the uppermost achievement\nlevels and in gifted and talented programs;\n\n  (E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be over-\nrepresented among students qualifying for special\neducation programs provided to students with learn-\ning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional\nimpairment, and other such disabilities;\n\n  (F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepre-\nsented in institutions of higher education and among\nadults who have completed four or more years of\ncollege;\n\n   (G) Native Hawaiians continue to be dispropor-\ntionately represented in many negative social and\nphysical statistics indicative of special educational\nneeds[;] . . .\n\n. . . and\n\n   (H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 per-\ncent of the students served by the State of Hawaii\nDepartment of Education, and there are and will con-\ntinue to be geographically rural, isolated areas with\na high Native Hawaiian population density.\n\f19062               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n20 U.S.C. § 7512(16)(A)-(H).\n\n   In addition, the most recent Native Hawaiian Educational\nAssessment, published in September 2005, concluded that,\n“[o]n the whole, . . . Native Hawaiian children in the public\nschool system perform poorly in school compared with their\nnon-Hawaiian peers.” Ka Huakai, 2005 Native Hawaiian\nEducational Assessment 229, available at http://ulukau.org/\nelib/cgi-bin/library?c=nhea&l=en (hereinafter “Ka Huakai”).\nThat most recent report found that 75% of public schools with\na predominantly Native Hawaiian student body did not meet\nthe state’s adequate yearly progress standards, but that num-\nber dropped to less than 58% for schools without a majority\nof Native Hawaiians, a difference of more than 17%. Id. at\n251. Also, Native Hawaiian students in elementary and sec-\nondary public schools ranked the lowest of all major ethnic\ngroups throughout the state in reading and math, falling\nbetween 9 and 15 percentiles behind the state average. Id. at\n261, 268. In addition, only 69.4% of Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents graduated from high school in 2002, compared to a state\naverage of 76.6% overall. Id. at 285.4\n\n  B.

Although the school\n  4\n    Disparities abound outside of the educational context as well. Today\namong the major ethnic groups in Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have the\nhighest rates of unemployment, Ka Huakai at 84, and poverty, id. at 86-87,\nand the lowest mean family income, id. at 85-86.

Accordingly, § 1981 has “roots” in both the Thir-\nteenth and the Fourteenth Amendments. Gen. Bldg. Contrac-\ntors, 458 U.S. at 390 n.17.

Even though the Supreme Court\nimported the purposeful discrimination element of its equal\nprotection jurisprudence to § 1981, later Supreme Court pre-\ncedent regarding § 1981 and Title VII suggests that the “strict\nscrutiny” standard of equal protection does not apply to a\nwholly private school’s race-based remedial admissions plan.\n\n   In Patterson v.

The Setser court addressed two issues\nthat are relevant here: “(1) whether section 1981 prohibits all\nrace-conscious affirmative action; [and] (2) whether the stan-\ndards for reviewing affirmative action under [T]itle VII gov-\nern the review of such plans under section 1981.” 657 F.2d at\n965.\n\n   The Eighth Circuit first concluded that § 1981 does not bar\naffirmative action programs, even in light of McDonald, 427\nU.S. at 296, which held that § 1981 affords protection to\nwhite people. In so holding, the Setser court looked to the\nSupreme Court’s decision in United Steelworkers of Am. v.\nWeber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), which held that Title VII does\nnot bar all preferential treatment on the basis of race, and\napplied the same rationale to § 1981:\n\n    It would indeed be . . . ironic if the Civil Rights Act\n    of 1866 was used now to prohibit the only effective\n    remedy for past discriminatory employment prac-\n    tices against blacks and other minorities, when the\n    Act was virtually useless to prevent the occurrence\n\f19070            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n    of such discrimination for more than a century . . . .\n    We conclude that the Supreme Court, by approving\n    race-conscious affirmative action by employers in\n    Weber, implicitly approved the use of race-conscious\n    plans to remedy past discrimination under section\n    1981. To open the door for such plans under [T]itle\n    VII and close it under section 1981 would make little\n    sense. The prohibition under section 1981 of affir-\n    mative action plans permissible under [T]itle VII\n    would bar a remedy Congress left within the discre-\n    tion of private employers when it passed [T]itle VII.\n\nSetser, 657 F.2d at 966-67 (emphasis added).\n\n   Having determined that affirmative action plans were per-\nmissible, the Setser court expressly “equat[ed] the affirmative\naction standards of [T]itle VII with those of section 1981.” Id.\nat 967. The court did so in view of the general principle that,\n“[i]n fashioning a substantive body of law under section 1981\nthe courts should, in an effort to avoid undesirable substantive\nlaw conflicts, look to ethe principles of law created under\n[T]itle VII for direction.” Id. (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). This principle of consistency was especially important to\nthe Setser court because it found untenable the prospect that\nan employer could be ordered, under Title VII, to implement\nan affirmative action plan, but simultaneously barred from\nimplementing that same plan under § 1981, if the two statutes\nwere interpreted differently. Id. at 967-68.\n\n   The Third Circuit in a recent decision, as well as other\ncourts, have followed Setser in using Title VII standards to\nevaluate private affirmative action plans challenged under\n§ 1981.

In those cases, the Supreme Court strictly scrutinized\nthe admissions policies of a public university, the University\nof Michigan Law School and its undergraduate counterpart.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326 (law school); Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n270 (undergraduate institution). Plaintiff places great stock in\nthe fact that in both cases, the Supreme Court mentioned\n§ 1981 in conjunction with the plaintiff’s Equal Protection\nClause claim. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (noting that,\nbecause the law school’s admissions policy satisfied strict\nscrutiny review under the Equal Protection Clause, it also sat-\nisfied § 1981); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 275-76 & n.23 (noting that,\nbecause the university’s undergraduate admissions program\nfailed strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, it also\nviolated § 1981).\n\n   To support both of its holdings, the Court cited General\nBuilding Contractors for the proposition that discrimination\nthat violates the Equal Protection Clause also violates § 1981.\nSee Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (noting that “the prohibition\nagainst discrimination in § 1981 is co-extensive with the\nEqual Protection Clause”); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23\n(“[P]urposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will also violate\n§ 1981.”). As explained earlier, in General Building Contrac-\ntors, the Court held that § 1981, like the Equal Protection\nClause, prohibits only purposeful discrimination and therefore\ndoes not permit claims of disparate impact. 458 U.S. at 389.\nRead in context, we believe that the Supreme Court’s citation\nto General Building Contractors in the University of Michi-\ngan cases was meant to signal only the fact that both § 1981\nand the Fourteenth Amendment require intentional discrimi-\nnation. Whether strict scrutiny applies to § 1981 claims was\n\f19072             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nnot at issue. In Grutter and Gratz, cases involving state\naction, the schools perforce did not argue that their programs\nsatisfied § 1981. The Court in Grutter and Gratz simply did\nnot consider the question.\n\n   [5] In view of the precedents that we have just discussed,\nwe conclude that Title VII principles apply here. Defendant\nis a purely private entity that receives no federal funds. The\nSupreme Court has never applied strict scrutiny to the actions\nof a purely private entity. The question remains how best to\nadapt the Title VII employment framework to an educational\ncontext and to the unique historical circumstances of this case.\n\n  C. Applying a Modified Title VII Standard in the\n  Educational Context Under § 1981\n\n   Only step three of the traditional three-stage Title VII anal-\nysis, Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, is\nat issue here. At step one, Plaintiff established a prima facie\ncase by showing (as the Schools concede) that the Kameha-\nmeha Schools consider applicants’ Hawaiian ancestry, or lack\nthereof, in making admissions decisions. At step two, the\nKamehameha Schools have specified their remedial admis-\nsions policy as the non-discriminatory rationale for their deci-\nsions. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626 (holding that an\naffirmative action plan provides a legitimate reason for a hir-\ning decision that considers race or ethnicity). The validity of\nthis policy is the focus of the parties’ attentions in this case.\nThat is, at step three, Plaintiff asserts that the Schools’ “justi-\nfication is pretextual and the [admissions] plan is invalid.” Id.\nThe burden of proof at this step lies with Plaintiff. Id. at 627.\n\n  The Supreme Court has outlined the appropriate step-three\nTitle VII inquiry in the context of private employment. In\nWeber, the Court held for the first time that Title VII does not\nprevent private employers from implementing voluntary,\nremedial affirmative action plans. 443 U.S. at 208. Weber\ninvolved an employer that had established a training program\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19073\nand reserved 50% of the program’s openings for black\nemployees until the percentage of black workers in its plant\nreached the percentage of black workers in the local labor\nforce. Id. at 197. In concluding that the plan was permissible\nunder Title VII, the Court noted that the plan did not “unnec-\nessarily trammel the interests of the white employees” or\n“create an absolute bar to the[ir] advancement.” Id. at 208.\nThe Court based its decision in part on the fact that the plan\nwas a “temporary measure\": “Preferential selection . . . will\nend as soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in\nthe Gramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in\nthe local labor force.” Id. at 208-09. The Court declined to\n“define in detail the line of demarcation between permissible\nand impermissible affirmative action plans.” Id. at 208; see\nalso Johnson, 770 F.2d at 757 (noting that the Supreme Court\nhad not “establish[ed] a rigid formula for testing the validity\nof an affirmative action plan”), aff’d, 480 U.S. at 641.\n\n   [6] Eight years later, in Johnson, the Court concluded that\na county-agency employer did not violate Title VII by taking\ninto consideration the sex of a female employee in deciding\nto promote her instead of a male employee. The promotional\npolicy, which took into consideration the sex and race of an\napplicant, was valid because it attempted to eliminate a “man-\nifest imbalance” in a “traditionally segregated job categor[y].”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 631 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nLike Weber, Johnson also considered whether the plan unnec-\nessarily trammeled the rights of the non-preferred class, in\nthis case men, or created an absolute bar to their advance-\nment. Id. at 637-38. Finally, the Court considered whether the\nplan was “temporary,” designed to “attain a balanced work\nforce, not to maintain one.” Id. at 639-40.\n\n  [7] We recently distilled the Court’s analysis this way: pri-\nvate employers’ affirmative action plans (1) must respond to\na manifest imbalance in the work force; (2) must not “unnec-\nessarily trammel[ ]” the rights of members of the non-\npreferred class or “create an absolute bar to their advance-\n\f19074            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nment\"; and (3) must do no more than is necessary to attain a\nbalance. Rudebusch v. Hughes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520-21 (9th Cir.\n2002). In Rudebusch, we found that the pay equity plan at\nissue was “not wholly analogous” to the hiring and promo-\ntional plans at issue in Weber and Johnson because of “some\nsignificant conceptual differences” between the types of\nplans. Id. at 520. We nevertheless applied the three Johnson\nfactors, taking account of “the context of our case.” Id. at 521.\nSimilarly, we hold today that the Johnson factors, modified to\nfit “the context of our case,” provide the appropriate frame-\nwork for determining whether a wholly private K-12 educa-\ntional institution’s remedial admissions policy is valid.\n\n   We note that, when assessing the validity of affirmative\naction plans, the Supreme Court has consistently recognized\nthe importance of deferring to the judgment and expertise of\nthe relevant decisionmakers. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328\n(deferring to education officials in admissions decisions);\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 206 (giving deference to employers in hir-\ning decisions). In the employment context, the Supreme Court\nheld that, in enacting Title VII, Congress wished to preserve,\nto the maximum extent possible, the freedom and discretion\ntraditionally afforded to private businesses. Weber, 443 U.S.\nat 206-07. In the educational context, the Court has under-\nscored that “complex educational judgments” should be left\nlargely to schools.

Perhaps more relevant here, increased pri-\nmary and secondary school educational achievement by\nminority groups can obviate the downstream need for affirma-\ntive action programs by employers and institutions of higher\nlearning. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 635 (noting that very lim-\nited numbers of women and minorities possess the “special-\nized training and experience” required for many categories of\n\f19076            DOE v.

While private employers strive primar-\nily to make money, and public employers (such as police and\nfire departments) perform a specific public function, schools\npursue a much broader mission: the development of all chil-\ndren to become citizens, leaders, and workers.\n\n   [8] The Title VII cases, in the employment context, recog-\nnize the laudable goal of achieving diversity and proportional\nrepresentation in the workplace; this goal necessarily focuses\ninternally and is limited to the “employer’s work force.”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 632. By contrast, ensuring that signifi-\ncantly underachieving minority groups are included fully as\ntomorrow’s citizens, leaders, and workers necessarily focuses\nexternally. Considering this important difference, we con-\nclude that we should use a standard for evaluating remedial\nracial preferences by wholly private primary and secondary\nschools that is akin to that used in Title VII employment\ncases, but that takes into account the inherently broad and\nsocietal focus of the educational endeavor.\n\n   [9] Adjusting the first Johnson factor to account for this\nexternal focus, we hold that, to justify a remedial racial pref-\nerence, a private school must demonstrate that specific, signif-\nicant imbalances in educational achievement presently affect\nthe target population. The external focus of the educational\nmission renders unnecessary the requirement of proof of a\n“manifest imbalance” within a particular school; the relevant\npopulation is the community as a whole. At the same time, the\nstrict focus on present, demonstrable disparities in educational\nachievement limits the types of permissible programs and dis-\ntinguishes a more amorphous program that relies solely on\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19077\ngeneral past societal discrimination. See City of Richmond v.\nJ.A.

Just as imbalance\nshould be viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a\nsingle school, so should the respective rights of members of\nthe non-preferred group. Therefore, within the community as\na whole, an admissions policy must not “unnecessarily tram-\nmel” the rights of students in the non-preferred class or\n“create an absolute bar” to their advancement. The third John-\nson factor is similarly modified: an admissions policy must do\nno more than is necessary to remedy the imbalance in the\ncommunity as a whole, that we identified at the first step.\nThese three factors best harmonize the relevant statutes and\nSupreme Court cases.\n\n   Judge Bybee’s reliance on Runyon in attacking our conclu-\nsion is particularly misplaced. As his dissent quotes several\ntimes, diss. at 19105, 19106, 19110, the Supreme Court in\nRunyon held that private primary schools in Virginia that cat-\negorically denied admission to African-American applicants\nrepresented a “classic violation of § 1981.” Runyon, 427 U.S.\nat 172. Nothing in the modified Johnson framework that we\nadopt today, or indeed anywhere in this opinion, is to the con-\ntrary. Quite simply, Runyon is inapposite: The program at\nissue in Runyon would certainly fail the first step of our anal-\nysis because specific, significant imbalances did not exist\nfavoring African-Americans. To the contrary, specific, signif-\nicant imbalances did exist disfavoring African-Americans.\nThe Civil Rights Act was passed specifically with the plight\nof African-Americans in mind. It is therefore unsurprising\nthat the Court labeled a whites-only admissions policy a\n“classic violation of § 1981.”\n\n   By contrast, the very nature of affirmative action plans is\nthat historically disfavored and underachieving minorities\nmay be given preferential treatment in certain narrowly\n\f19078            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ndefined, limited programs. It is the contours of such a\nprogram—a private school’s voluntary remedial admissions\nprogram—that we explore today. We turn now to applying the\nthree modified Johnson factors to the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy.\n\n    1.   Respond to a Manifest Imbalance\n\n   [11] To meet the first modified Johnson factor, a private\nschool must demonstrate that, in the relevant community, spe-\ncific, significant imbalances in educational achievement pres-\nently affect the group favored by its admissions policy. The\nrelevant community in this case is the state of Hawaii,\nbecause the Schools serve students from all of Hawaii’s\nislands. We therefore consider whether a manifest imbalance\nin current educational achievement exists between Native\nHawaiians and other ethnic groups in Hawaii.\n\n   Native Hawaiian students are systemically disadvantaged in\nthe classroom. As we described earlier, there is a substantial\ndisparity in performance between Native Hawaiian students\nand other ethnic groups. Briefly, Native Hawaiian students\nscore lower on standardized tests than all other ethnic groups\nin the state, Ka Huakai at 229, 261, are more likely to be in\nspecial education classes, id. at 278, are more likely to be\nabsent from school, id. at 229, and are more likely to attend\npoor-quality schools, id. at 252. Native Hawaiians are the\nleast likely of the state’s major ethnic groups to graduate from\nhigh school, id. at 229, 285, and they are less likely than their\nnon-Hawaiian counterparts to attend college, id. at 118-19.\nCongress has expressly recognized the educational disadvan-\ntages suffered by Native Hawaiians and their marginalized\nstatus. 20 U.S.C. § 7512.\n\n   In view of those facts and congressional findings, it is clear\nthat a manifest imbalance exists in the K-12 educational arena\nin the state of Hawaii, with Native Hawaiians falling at the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19079\nbottom of the spectrum in almost all areas of educational\nprogress and success.\n\n   Furthermore, it is precisely this manifest imbalance that the\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy seeks to address.\nThe goal is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educa-\ntional parity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii. The stated\npurpose of Kamehameha Schools is to create educational\nopportunities to improve the capability and well-being of\nNative Hawaiians and to cultivate, nurture, and perpetuate\nHawaiian culture, values, history, and language.\n\n   To that end, the Schools advance a curriculum specially tai-\nlored to students of Native Hawaiian descent. The Schools\nhave pinpointed areas in which Native Hawaiians, in particu-\nlar, are severely disadvantaged and have developed a curricu-\nlum to attend to those needs. The Schools have instituted a\n“Leadership Model” of education, meant to “restore self-\nidentity, integrate Native Hawaiian culture, heritage, lan-\nguage, and traditions into the educational process, and provide\na first-rate educational experience for Native Hawaiians.” The\nSchools’ efforts are aimed at increasing scores on standard-\nized tests, increasing the number of Native Hawaiians attend-\ning colleges and graduate schools, improving Native\nHawaiian representation in professional, academic, and mana-\ngerial positions, and developing community leaders who are\ncommitted to improving the lives of all Native Hawaiians.\n\n   In addition, the Kamehameha Schools recognized, early on,\na critical need to help perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture. As\na result, in the 1940s, the Schools instituted a formal Hawai-\nian Cultural Program that continues today. Courses on Hawai-\nian history and culture are required before a student may\ngraduate.\n\n   [12] The Kamehameha Schools have shown that specific,\nsignificant imbalances in educational achievement currently\naffect Native Hawaiians in Hawaii and that the Schools aim\n\f19080               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nto remedy that imbalance. Accordingly, they have satisfied\nthe “manifest imbalance” criterion.\n\n       2.   Do Not Unnecessarily Trammel the Rights of\n       Members of the Non-Preferred Class or Create an\n       Absolute Bar to Their Advancement\n\n   Under the second prong of the modified Title VII analysis,\nwe ask whether, within the relevant community of Hawaii, the\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy unnecessarily tram-\nmels the rights of members of the non-preferred class, that is,\nstudents with no Hawaiian ancestry, or creates an absolute bar\nto their advancement.\n\n  The Kamehameha Schools allow all students to apply for\nadmission. But once the applications are received, the Schools\nconsider the ethnic background of the students and admit\nqualified children with Native Hawaiian ancestry before\nadmitting children with no such ancestry. Because the pool of\nqualified potential students with Native Hawaiian blood\ngreatly outnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-\nNative Hawaiians generally are not admitted.10 For the rea-\nsons that follow, however, the Schools’ admissions policy\ndoes not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-Native\nHawaiians or create an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\n   [13] We begin by noting that nothing in the record suggests\nthat educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for stu-\ndents, like Plaintiff, who lack any Native Hawaiian ancestry.\nTo the contrary, the same statistical data that portray the diffi-\nculties of Native Hawaiian children generally portray much\ngreater educational achievement, in both public and private\n  10\n    One student without Native Hawaiian ancestry has been admitted to\nthe Schools in recent years because, for one class, the available seats out-\nnumbered the applicants with Native Hawaiian ancestry. See Timothy\nHurley & Walker Wright, Kamehameha Schools admits non-Hawaiian,\nHonolulu Advertiser, July 12, 2002.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19081\nprimary and secondary schools, for children of all other racial\nand ethnic groups in Hawaii. Those students denied admission\nby Kamehameha Schools have ample and adequate alternative\neducational options. The well-documented ability of non-\nNative Hawaiians to attain educational achievement in Hawaii\nnotwithstanding the Kamehameha Schools’ longstanding\nadmissions policy demonstrates that the policy neither unnec-\nessarily trammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor\nabsolutely bars their advancement in the relevant community.\n\n   Our inquiry does not stop there, however. The history of\nNative Hawaiians and of the Kamehameha Schools has cer-\ntain unique features that Congress has acknowledged. In\n1993, Congress admitted that the United States was responsi-\nble, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy.\n1993 Apology Resolution, 107 Stat. 1510. Later, when it\nenacted education-related legislation in 1994, and then reen-\nacted that legislation in 2002, Congress made findings regard-\ning the disadvantages faced by Native Hawaiian students in\nthe public school system in Hawaii. 20 U.S.C. §§ 7901-7941,\n7512(16). As part of the 2002 reenactment, a congressional\ncommittee even urged the Bishop Trust, which operates the\nKamehameha Schools, to “redouble its efforts to educate\nNative Hawaiian children.” H.R. Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333\n(2001) (emphasis added).\n\n   Congressional recognition of the challenges faced by\nNative Hawaiians in the educational arena supports our con-\nclusion that the Schools’ policy does not unnecessarily tram-\nmel the rights of non-Native Hawaiians. To the contrary, as\nCongress has recognized, in the unique context of Native\nHawaiian history, affirmative measures are needed to address\npresent, severe inequalities in educational achievement.\n\n  Finally, we examine the expectations of those who lack\nNative Hawaiian ancestry. The Supreme Court observed in\nJohnson that “the denial of the promotion [at issue] unsettled\nno legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the part of peti-\n\f19082            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntioner.” 480 U.S. at 638. Similarly, here, we must ask whether\nPlaintiff had a legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of admis-\nsion to the Schools. The answer is “no.”\n\n   No applicant to the Kamehameha Schools is guaranteed\nadmission. Just as the applicant in Johnson “had no absolute\nentitlement” to the promotion from his employer, Plaintiff\nhere likewise “had no absolute entitlement” to admission to\nthe Schools. Id.\n\n   Furthermore, the Kamehameha Schools were established\nwhen Hawaii was a sovereign nation, and they were built on\nthe Hawaiian monarchy’s land. When the Schools began, a\nnon-Native Hawaiian had no expectation of admission to the\nSchools, except when Native Hawaiians failed to fill all the\navailable slots, or until Native Hawaiians achieved educa-\ntional parity with others. See supra p. 19058. In the interven-\ning 118 years, the Schools’ admissions policy, and therefore\nthe expectations of the non-Native Hawaiians, has remained\nconstant. Thus, denial of Plaintiff’s application for admission\n“unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation.” Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 638.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy does not unnecessarily trammel the rights\nof non-Native Hawaiians or create an absolute bar to their\nadvancement.\n\n    3.   Do No More than Is Necessary\n\n   Finally, the Schools’ admissions policy must do no more\nthan is necessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered\nby students of Native Hawaiian ancestry. This factor requires\nthat an affirmative action plan be “temporary.” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 640; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208.\n\n   The Kamehameha Schools’ decision to give preference to\nstudents with Native Hawaiian ancestry is limited in duration\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19083\nin two distinct ways. First, if qualified students with Native\nHawaiian ancestry do not apply to the Schools in sufficient\nnumbers to fill the spots available, as happened in one recent\nyear, see supra note 10, the Schools’ policy is to open admis-\nsions to any qualified candidate. Second, preference will be\ngiven to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry only for so\nlong as is necessary to remedy the current educational effects\nof past, private and government-sponsored discrimination and\nof social and economic deprivation. These dual aspects of the\nKamehameha Schools’ policy constitute an “[e]xpress assur-\nance that a program is only temporary.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n639-40. An explicit or immediately foreseeable end date has\nnever been required for an affirmative action plan to be valid.\nSee, e.g., id. at 639 (finding the lack of an “explicit end date”\n\"unsurprising” and upholding an employer’s affirmative\naction plan even though “only gradual” improvements were\nanticipated); see also Grutter 539 U.S. at 343 (adopting Jus-\ntice Powell’s reasoning in the 25-year-old Bakke decision,\nwhich upheld affirmative action programs in higher educa-\ntion, and expecting that in 25 more years, these programs\n“will no longer be necessary\"—a span of 50 years).\n\n   [14] Because the admissions policy is not fixed, but\nchanges as the capacity of the Schools’ programs increases\nand as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian community\nrises, the policy does no more than is necessary in light of the\nsignificant educational imbalances that Native Hawaiians con-\ntinue to face.\n\n   [15] Accordingly, the Kamehameha Schools’ admissions\npolicy satisfies the three Johnson criteria—offset a manifest\nimbalance, do not unnecessarily trammel others’ rights or\ncreate an absolute bar, and do no more than is necessary—as\nmodified for the private primary and secondary school con-\ntext. The Schools have shown that the admissions policy,\nfavoring students of Native Hawaiian descent, is legitimate\nand valid.\n\f19084            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   Judge Bybee’s dissent contends that we should hew more\nclosely to a traditional Title VII analysis and that, under such\nan analysis, the Schools’ preferential admissions policy is not\nvalid. (Bybee, J., diss. at 19104-52.) For the reasons that we\nhave detailed, we believe that the dissent’s focus is too nar-\nrow for the private school context and that Kamehameha\nSchools’ remedial admissions policy is legitimate in the face\nof the serious and systemic disadvantages faced by Native\nHawaiian students in Hawaii today. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n640 (“In evaluating the compliance of an affirmative action\nplan with Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination, we must\nbe mindful of this Court’s and Congress’ consistent emphasis\non the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of\nthe law.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Rude-\nbusch, 313 F.3d at 522-24 (revising the third Johnson factor\nto analyze quantitative rather than temporal limitations\nbecause of the context).\n\n   Even if we were to try to shove a square peg into a round\nhole by strictly applying the test developed in employment\ncases to the Kamehameha Schools’ admissions policy, that\npolicy would still be valid. As the Supreme Court has cau-\ntioned, “[i]t is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the\nletter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not\nwithin its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.” Weber,\n443 U.S. at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nKamehameha Schools’ admissions policy holds true to the\nspirit of § 1981 by supporting Native Hawaiian students so\nthat they may attain parity with their non-Native Hawaiian\npeers. See Gen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 386.\n\n  D. Alternatively, and in Addition, Congress Specifically\n  Intended to Allow the Kamehameha Schools to Operate\n  When, in 1991, It Re-enacted § 1981.\n\n   Plaintiff brought suit under § 1981. He has brought no con-\nstitutional claims. Thus, we are charged only with determin-\ning Congress’ intent.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19085\n   Congress originally enacted what later became 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981 in 1870. At that time, the statute did not apply in\nHawaii because it was an independent, sovereign kingdom.\nCongress could not have had any conscious intention as to\nhow the statute would apply in Hawaii, because it did not\napply at all. When Hawaii became a territory in 1898, § 1981\napplied, as it continued to do when Hawaii became a state in\n1959, see Hawaiian Statehood Act, Pub. L. No. 86-3, § 15, 73\nStat. 4.11 (1959), but it was not until 1991 that Congress\nagain addressed and amended § 1981, see Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 101, 105 Stat. 1071. The 1991\namendments are the most recent, and indeed the only, time\nsince Hawaii became a territory that Congress has reenacted\n§ 1981.\n\n   Therefore, we must determine what Congress intended,\nwith regard to Native Hawaiians, when it reenacted § 1981 in\n1991. Because “[w]e assume that Congress is aware of exist-\ning law when it passes legislation,” Miles v. Apex Marine\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112503\"><a href=\"/opinion/112503/miles-v-apex-marine-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1990), we must consider Congress’\nlong history of providing for Native Hawaiians through legis-\nlation. See Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112075\"><a href=\"/opinion/112075/goodyear-atomic-corp-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n184-85 (1988) (noting that courts “generally presume that\nCongress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the\nlegislation it enacts”). By construing § 1981 in the context of\npast congressional action that recognizes and provides for\nNative Hawaiians, we preserve the “sense and purpose” of all\nrelevant statutes. See Watt v. Alaska, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110466\"><a href=\"/opinion/110466/watt-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267\n(1981) (noting that it is the duty of the courts to give effect\nto differing and conflicting statutes so as to preserve their\n“sense and purpose”). Importantly, the Supreme Court has\nexpressly considered contemporaneous legislation when inter-\npreting the scope of § 1981. In Runyon, for instance, the Court\nrelied on Congress’ enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nand other civil rights legislation in concluding that Congress\nmust have intended § 1981 to reach private acts of discrimina-\ntion. 427 U.S. at 174; see also Weber, 443 U.S. at 201 (noting\nthat the application of Title VII to remedial affirmative action\n\f19086            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nplans must be read in light of its legislative history and “the\nhistorical context from which the Act arose”).\n\n   Accordingly, we look to legislation that Congress has\npassed specifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before\nand after 1991. As we have explained, we consider the pre-\n1991 statutory landscape because it informs us about what\nCongress had in mind when it reenacted § 1981. We consider\nthe post-1991 statutes to the extent that they demonstrate\nCongress’ own understanding of § 1981. That is, we presume\nthat Congress acts consistently with the extant body of law;\nstatutes enacted after 1991, therefore, must be read consis-\ntently with the revised version of § 1981. See Cannon v. Univ.\nof Chi., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696-97 (1979) (concluding that elected\nofficials are presumed to know the law, and that statutes\nshould be read consistently with each other).\n\n  Beginning as early as 1920, Congress recognized that a\nspecial relationship existed between the United States and\nHawaii. See Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, 42 Stat.\n108 (1921) (designating approximately 200,000 acres of\nceded public lands to Native Hawaiians for homesteading).\nOver the years, Congress has reaffirmed the unique relation-\nship that the United States has with Hawaii, as a result of the\nAmerican involvement in the overthrow of the Hawaiian\nmonarchy. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 7512(12), (13) (Native\nHawaiian Education Act, 2002); 42 U.S.C. § 11701(13), (14),\n(19), (20) (Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988).\n\n   Congress has relied on the special relationship that the\nUnited States has with Native Hawaiians to provide specifi-\ncally for their welfare in a number of different contexts. For\nexample, in 1987, Congress amended the Native American\nPrograms Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 100-175, § 506, 101 Stat.\n926 (1987), to provide federal funds for a state agency or\n“community-based Native Hawaiian organization” to “make\nloans to Native Hawaiian organizations and to individual\nNative Hawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19087\ndevelopment in the state of Hawaii.” A year later, Congress\nenacted the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, Pub.\nL. No. 100-579, § 11703(a), 102 Stat. 2916 (1988), “for the\npurpose of providing comprehensive health promotion and\ndisease prevention services as well as primary health services\nto Native Hawaiians.”\n\n   Most importantly for our purposes today, Congress also has\nfocused its attention on the educational disparities faced by\nNative Hawaiian students. In 1988, just three years before\nreenacting § 1981, Congress passed the Augustus F. Hawkins-\nRobert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School\nImprovement Amendments of 1988. 20 U.S.C. §§ 4901-4909\n(1988) (repealed 1994) (hereinafter “Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments”). Congress made extensive findings, similar to\nthe findings that it later made in 2002, see supra pp. 19060-\n61, about the educational needs of Native Hawaiians and rec-\nognized the necessity for “special efforts in education recog-\nnizing the unique cultural and historical circumstances of\nNative Hawaiians.” 20 U.S.C. § 4901(9) (1988) (repealed\n1994). For instance, Congress concluded that it has the power\nto “specially legislate for the benefit of Native Hawaiians,”\nencouraged Native Hawaiians to play an active role in plan-\nning and managing Native Hawaiian educational programs,\nand noted that Native Hawaiians disproportionally fell below\ntheir peers in terms of educational achievement and progress.\nId. § 4901(2) (1988) (repealed 1994). Congress then went on\nto affirm specifically the mission of Kamehameha Schools\nand the Schools’ model elementary curriculum, approving by\nname the Schools’ continued research and assessment activi-\nties. Id. § 4904(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). Similarly, Congress\ndirected the Secretary of Education to make grants to the\nSchools “for a demonstration program to provide Higher Edu-\ncation fellowship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.” Id.\n§ 4905(a) (1988) (repealed 1994). The sole recipients of that\nassistance were to be “Native Hawaiians,” a term that was\ndefined in the statute, as it is by Kamehameha Schools, as “a\ndescendant of the aboriginal people, who prior to 1778, occu-\n\f19088             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises\nthe State of Hawaii.”11 Id. § 4909(1)(C) (1988) (repealed\n1994).\n\n   The Hawkins-Stafford Amendments were repealed in 1994.\n20 U.S.C. § 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994). But for two reasons\nthat fact does not alter the landscape of Native Hawaiian-\noriented congressional enactments against which § 1981 must\nbe read. First, when Congress reenacted § 1981 in 1991, the\nHawkins-Stafford Amendments were still in effect. Second,\nCongress has continued thereafter to emphasize the need for\nspecial educational opportunities for Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents. (See Concurrence, pp. 19101-02.)\n\n   After reenacting § 1981, Congress passed the Native\nHawaiian Education Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. §§ 7901-7941,\nand then reenacted that statute in 2002, 20 U.S.C. §§ 7511-\n7517 (hereinafter “NHEA”). Like the Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments, the NHEA recognized the special needs of\nNative Hawaiian students and the great disadvantages that\nthey still face in Hawaii. Id. § 7512. As part of the No Child\nLeft Behind Act of 2001, a congressional committee favor-\nably mentioned the Bishop Trust and exhorted the Schools to\n“redouble [their] efforts” to provide for Native Hawaiians.\nH.R. Rep. No. 107-63(I), at 333.\n\n   These steadfast congressional policies favoring remedial\nmeasures for Native Hawaiians—and specifically remedial\neducational measures, some of them even mentioning the\nSchools and the Bishop Trust approvingly by name—inform\nour analysis of the validity of the Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy under § 1981. It would be incongruous to\nconclude that while Congress was repeatedly enacting reme-\ndial measures aimed exclusively at Native Hawaiians, at the\nsame time Congress would reject such Native Hawaiian pref-\n  11\n    According to the record, as we have noted, the Kamehameha Schools\ncurrently receive no money from Congress.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19089\nerences through § 1981. Moreover, by reenacting § 1981 in\nthe midst of passing other legislation to provide specifically\nand particularly for the education of Native Hawaiians, Con-\ngress signaled its clear support for the Kamehameha Schools\nand for the validity of the Schools’ admissions policy.\n\n   [16] Accordingly, the most plausible reading of § 1981, in\nlight of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the NHEA, is\nthat Congress intended that a preference for Native Hawai-\nians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organization, located\non the Hawaiian monarchy’s ancestral lands, be upheld\nbecause it furthers the urgent need for better education of\nNative Hawaiians, which Congress has repeatedly identified\nas necessary.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   [17] King Kamehameha I, on his death bed, is reported to\nhave said, “Tell my people I have planted in the soil of our\nland the roots of a plan for their happiness.” Princess Pauahi\nBishop and Her Legacy at 122. His great granddaughter, Prin-\ncess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, echoed that sentiment when she\nestablished, through her will, the Kamehameha Schools.\nBecause the Schools are a wholly private K-12 educational\nestablishment, whose preferential admissions policy is\ndesigned to counteract the significant, current educational def-\nicits of Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii, and because in\n1991 Congress clearly intended § 1981 to exist in harmony\nwith its other legislation providing specially for the education\nof Native Hawaiians, we must conclude that the admissions\npolicy is valid under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f19090             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges PREGER-\nSON, REINHARDT, PAEZ, and RAWLINSON join, concur-\nring:\n\n  I fully concur with Judge Graber’s majority opinion. How-\never, I write separately because there is an easier and nar-\nrower ground for upholding Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy.\n\n   The question in this case is whether 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for-\nbids Kamehameha Schools from giving Native Hawaiian\napplicants a conclusive preference for admission into its K-12\nprograms. In answering this question, the majority opinion\nassumes that “Native Hawaiian is a racial classification.” Op.\nat 19067 n.9. Based on this assumption, it holds that § 1981\npermits private schools, in certain circumstances, to prefer\ndisadvantaged minority groups — not limited to Native\nHawaiians — based on race. But the case before us does not\ninvolve an admissions policy generally favoring disadvan-\ntaged minorities, or favoring specific racial or ethnic groups\nsuch as African-Americans or Hispanics. It involves only an\nadmissions policy favoring “Native Hawaiians,” defined as\npersons “descended from the aboriginal people who exercised\nsovereignty in the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778.” Op. at\n19058.\n\n   A narrower ground for sustaining Kamehameha Schools’\nadmissions policy is that “Native Hawaiian” is not merely a\nracial classification. It is also a political classification. I would\ndivide the question in this case into two sub-questions. First,\ncan Congress constitutionally provide special benefits, includ-\ning educational benefits, to descendants of Native Hawaiians\nbecause “Native Hawaiian” is a political classification? Sec-\nond, if the answer to this question is yes, has Congress done\nso in § 1981?\n\n  I.    Constitutionality of Preference for Native Hawaiians\n\n  Because of their history, ably recounted in the majority\nopinion, Native Hawaiians constitute a unique population that\n\f                  DOE v.

The basis for this exer-\ncise of power is Congress’ conclusion that “Native Hawai-\nian,” like “Alaska Native” and “Indian,” is a political\nclassification subject to the special relationship doctrine.\nUnless we were to hold that Congress cannot legislate for the\nspecial benefit of Native Hawaiians, thereby striking down\nthe enormous swaths of the United States Code enacted pur-\nsuant to the special relationship doctrine, we must conclude\nthat the doctrine permits Congress to provide special benefits\nto Native Hawaiians.\n\n   I recognize that the Court has struck down a statute grant-\ning preferential voting rights to Native Hawaiians, but voting\nrights are sui generis. In Rice v.

The term “Hawaiians”\nwas generally defined as descendants of people inhabiting the\nHawaiian Islands in 1778. Id. at 499, 509. The Court held that\nunder the Fifteenth Amendment “Congress may not authorize\na State to create a voting scheme of this sort.” Id. at 519. In\nso holding, the Court assumed “authority in Congress, dele-\ngated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as\ntribes,” id., but it refused to extend the special relationship\ndoctrine to the “new and larger dimension” of voting restric-\ntions in state elections. Id. at 520.\n\n  The Court in Rice was careful to confine its analysis to vot-\ning rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. It cautioned that\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19095\n“[t]he validity of the voting restriction is the only question\nbefore us.” Id. at 521. Emphasizing the importance and\nunique character of voting rights under the Fifteenth Amend-\nment, the Court wrote, “the Amendment is cast in fundamen-\ntal terms, terms transcending the particular controversy which\nwas the immediate impetus for its enactment.” Id. at 512. Fur-\nther, “use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole\nlegal order democratic elections seek to preserve.” Id. at 517;\nsee also Shaw v.

Rather, it involves the preferential provision of\neducational benefits. To the extent that the federal Constitu-\ntion is implicated at all, the relevant text is the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Rice\nnever questioned the validity of the special relationship doc-\ntrine under the Fourteenth Amendment, and never even hinted\nthat its Fifteenth Amendment analysis would apply to the\nmany benefit programs enacted by Congress for Native\nHawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.\n\n  I therefore conclude that Congress may, if it wishes, permit\nKamehameha Schools to give preferential admissions treat-\nment to Native Hawaiians. The remaining question is whether\nCongress has in fact done so under § 1981.\n\n                           II.   Section 1981\n\n   When Congress enacted § 1981 in the Civil Rights Act of\n1866, Act of Apr. 9, 1866, ch. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27, and reen-\nacted it four years later in the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act\nof May 31, 1870, ch. 114, §§ 16, 18, 16 Stat. 144, the Hawai-\nian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose people were\nnot “within the jurisdiction of the United States.”1 As stated\n  1\n    The 1866 statute used slightly different language, but to the same\neffect: the statute applied to “all persons born in the United States and not\nsubject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed.” 14 Stat. 27.\n\f19096               DOE v.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nto the Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate for\na demonstration program to provide Higher Education fellow-\nship assistance to Native Hawaiian students.” Id. § 4005(a),\n102 Stat. at 360. One year before reenacting § 1981, Congress\namended the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary\nto “provide funds to Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate for\nthe purpose of providing scholarship assistance” to eligible\nNative Hawaiian students. Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Pub. L. No.\n101-644, § 401, 104 Stat. 4662, 4668 (codified as amended at\n42 U.S.C. §254s). These federal statutes specifically directed\nKamehameha Schools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this\ncase say is forbidden by § 1981.\n\n   It was not until the 1991 amendments to § 1981 that Con-\ngress specified that it intends courts to apply the statute to\nsubstantive discrimination by private actors. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(c) (“The rights protected by this section are protected\nagainst impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and\nimpairment under color of State law.”). In order to hold for\nplaintiff in this case, we would have to conclude that Con-\ngress intended this provision to invalidate, sub silentio, the\nrecently enacted legislation that provided loans and scholar-\nships exclusively to Native Hawaiians at Kamehameha\nSchools. But this conclusion would require us to turn our back\non the Supreme Court’s analysis in Mancari, where it rejected\nthe challenge of non-Indian plaintiffs to Indian employment\npreferences as inconsistent with the federal Equal Employ-\nment Opportunity Act of 1972.\n\n  The Mancari plaintiffs argued that\n\n    since the [Equal Employment Opportunity Act of\n    1972] proscribed racial discrimination in Govern-\n    ment employment, the Act necessarily, albeit sub\n    silentio, repealed the provision of the [Indian Reor-\n    ganization Act of 1934] that called for the preference\n    in the [Bureau of Indian Affairs] of one racial group,\n    Indians, over non-Indians.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19099\nMancari, 417 U.S. at 547. The 1972 Act, upon which the\nMancari plaintiffs relied, amended Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. Id. at 546-47. Whereas the 1964 Civil\nRights Act had expressly exempted certain Indian prefer-\nences, neither the text nor the legislative history of the amend-\ning 1972 Act made any reference to such preferences. Id.\nGiven that the 1972 Act was specifically modeled on the 1964\nAct, the omission of an exemption for Indian preferences was\nespecially glaring, and the plaintiffs’ argument for sub silentio\nrepeal especially strong.\n\n   Nevertheless, the Supreme Court unanimously and emphat-\nically rejected the argument for sub silentio repeal by the\n1972 Amendment:\n\n    It would be anomalous to conclude that Congress\n    intended to eliminate the longstanding statutory\n    preferences in BIA employment, as being racially\n    discriminatory, at the very same time it was reaf-\n    firming the right of tribal and reservation-related\n    private employers to provide Indian preference.\n    Appellees’ assertion that Congress implicitly\n    repealed the preference as racially discriminatory,\n    while retaining the 1964 preferences, attributes to\n    Congress irrationality and arbitrariness, an attribu-\n    tion we do not share.\n\n    . . . Three months after Congress passed the 1972\n    amendments, it enacted two new Indian preference\n    laws . . . . It is improbable, to say the least, that the\n    same Congress which affirmatively approved and\n    enacted these additional and similar Indian prefer-\n    ences was, at the same time, condemning the BIA\n    preference as racially discriminatory. In the total\n    absence of any manifestation of supportive intent,\n    we are loathe to imply this improbable result.\n\n                             ***\n\f19100            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n       This is a prototypical case where an adjudication\n    of repeal by implication is not appropriate. The pref-\n    erence is a longstanding, important component of\n    the Government’s Indian program. The anti-\n    discrimination provision, aimed at alleviating\n    minority discrimination in employment, obviously is\n    designed to deal with an entirely different and,\n    indeed, opposite problem. Any perceived conflict is\n    thus more apparent than real.\n\n    . . . A provision aimed at furthering Indian self-\n    government by according an employment preference\n    within the BIA for qualified members of the gov-\n    erned group can readily co-exist with a general rule\n    prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis\n    of race. Any other conclusion can be reached only by\n    formalistic reasoning that ignores both the history\n    and purposes of the preference and the unique legal\n    relationship between the Federal Government and\n    tribal Indians.\n\n        Furthermore, the Indian preference statute is a\n    specific provision applying to a very specific situa-\n    tion. The 1972 Act, on the other hand, is of general\n    application. Where there is no clear intention other-\n    wise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nul-\n    lified by a general one, regardless of the priority of\n    enactment.\n\n       The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose\n    among congressional enactments, and when two stat-\n    utes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the\n    courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional\n    intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\n\nId. at 548-51 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n   The principal dissent insists that the failure of § 1981 to\ninclude in its text an explicit exception for Native Hawaiians\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19101\nis fatal to Kamehameha Schools’ admissions policy. But of all\nthe federal statutes to which strict text-based rules of statutory\nconstruction might be applied, § 1981 is a particularly inap-\npropriate candidate. The text of § 1981 only guarantees “the\nsame right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed\nby white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). It does not guarantee\nthe converse — the right of white persons or citizens to enjoy\nthe same contractual rights as non-whites. Therefore, accord-\ning to the dissent’s interpretive method, § 1981 should not be\nread to protect nonwhites against private racial discrimination.\nBut we know that, despite the clear text of § 1981, this con-\nclusion would be wrong, for the Supreme Court held in 1976\nthat whites as well as non-whites are protected under § 1981.\nMcDonald, 427 U.S. at 286-87.\n\n   Congress’ provision of educational benefits to Native\nHawaiians continues to this day. Congress repealed the Native\nHawaiian provisions of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments\nonly to replace them with the more comprehensive Native\nHawaiian Education Act (“NHEA”), Pub. L. No. 103-382,\n§§ 9201 et seq., 108 Stat. 3794 (1994) (formerly codified at\n20 U.S.C. §§ 7901 et seq.) (repealed 2002), which Congress\nlater reenacted in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. 20\nU.S.C. §§ 7511 et seq. As part of the No Child Left Behind\nAct of 2001, a congressional committee exhorted the Bishop\nTrust, which finances Kamehameha Schools, to “redouble its\nefforts to educate Native Hawaiian children.” H.R. Rep. No.\n107-63(I), at 333.\n\n   The NHEA continues to allocate money to private non-\nprofit organizations to provide programs for the exclusive\nbenefit of Native Hawaiians. See 20 U.S.C. § 7515. Kameha-\nmeha Schools’ definition of “Native Hawaiian” is virtually\nidentical to that used in the NHEA. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7517(1)(B) (defining “Native Hawaiian” as “a descendant\nof the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and\nexercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State\nof Hawaii”). The NHEA expressly declares that “Congress\n\f19102            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ndoes not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their\nrace, but because of their unique status as the indigenous peo-\nple of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States\nhas established a trust relationship.” 20 U.S.C. § 7512(12)(B).\n\n   Through the NHEA and the myriad other federal statutes\nthat confer benefits on Native Hawaiians, Congress has made\nmanifest its intent to apply some form of the special relation-\nship doctrine to Native Hawaiians. The well established gen-\neral rule is that less — not more — demanding scrutiny\napplies to private discrimination than to government-\nsponsored discrimination. It would be deeply ironic for us to\nhold that § 1981 forbids private institutions from giving\nNative Hawaiians educational benefits when, at the same\ntime, Congress itself provides such benefits and provides pub-\nlic funds for private organizations to do the same.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n   Congress has invariably treated “Native Hawaiian” as a\npolitical classification for purposes of providing exclusive\neducational and other benefits. Under the special relationship\ndoctrine, Congress has the power to do so. I see nothing in\n§ 1981 to indicate that Congress intended to impose upon pri-\nvate institutions a more restrictive standard for the provision\nof benefits to Native Hawaiians than it has imposed upon\nitself.\n\fDOE v.

Enacted soon after the passage of\nthe Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, § 1981 like—and\nperhaps more than—most of the reconstruction era civil rights\nenactments was intended to ensure “that a dollar in the hands\nof [any citizen] will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the\nhands of a white man.” Jones v.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19105\nnon-sectarian schools from denying admission to prospective\nstudents because they are” not members of a favored racial\ngroup. Indeed, as Runyon makes clear, discriminating against\na private school applicant solely on the basis of that appli-\ncant’s race “amounts to a classic violation of § 1981.” Id. at\n172.\n\n   Despite that well-established principle, the majority today\nstands Runyon on its head and holds that a private school may\ndeny admission to a prospective student solely because he or\nshe is not a member of a particular race. Though I agree with\nthe majority that Native Hawaiians suffer from severe socio-\neconomic disadvantages and believe that Kamehameha\nSchools (“Kamehameha”) should be commended for attempt-\ning to remedy those hardships, I cannot concur with the\nmajority’s dramatic departure from Runyon.\n\n   In my view, the majority has made a number of crucial mis-\ntakes. Thus, as set out below in Part I, even though I agree\nwith the majority that Title VII and not strict scrutiny pro-\nvides the standard of review in this case, I disagree with the\nmajority’s sweeping modification of the Title VII standard.\nMoreover, even if I agreed with the majority’s departure from\nthat standard, I could not subscribe to the majority’s decision\nto sanction an absolute racial bar. Likewise, as set out in Part\nII, I cannot accept as a matter of faithful statutory construc-\ntion the majority’s view that Congress implicitly exempted\nracial preferences for Native Hawaiians from § 1981 by pass-\ning unrelated—and even since repealed—statutes. Indeed, I\nbelieve the majority’s novel approach to statutory interpreta-\ntion is readily emanipulable and would enable courts to\nrewrite statutes whenever they want to save a particular pro-\ngram, contract, or enactment. Finally, as set out in Part III,\nbecause Native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recog-\nnized tribe and Kamehameha is a private party, I also disagree\nwith Judge Fletcher’s suggestion that the special relationship\ndoctrine of Morton v. Mancari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), can save\nKamehameha’s racially exclusive admissions policy.\n\f19106            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   As much as I may believe that Kamehameha should be\napplauded for providing its students an exceptional education\nand for attempting to remedy the socioeconomic disadvan-\ntages facing Native Hawaiians, I cannot turn a blind eye to a\nclassic violation of § 1981. Noble as Kamehameha’s goals\nmay be, good intentions are not license to violate our civil\nrights laws. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n        I.   REVIEW OF § 1981 UNDER TITLE VII\n                     STANDARDS\n\n   The John Doe plaintiff contends that Kamehameha’s\nadmissions policy—which bars the admission of any non-\nNative Hawaiian student, see Maj. Op. at 19080 & n.10—\nviolates 42 U.S.C. § 1981 because, as Runyon v. McCrary,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109509\"><a href=\"/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), makes clear, discriminating against a\nprivate school applicant solely on the basis of that applicant’s\nrace “amounts to a classic violation of § 1981.” Id. at 172.\nDespite the inherent logic of plaintiff’s argument, the majority\navoids reaching a similar conclusion by holding “[q]uite sim-\nply, Runyon is inapposite,” Maj. Op. at 19077, and grafting a\nmodified Title VII standard onto § 1981.\n\n   To create that new standard, the majority dismisses Runyon\nas irrelevant because “[t]he program at issue in Runyon would\ncertainly fail” the majority’s analysis. Id. In so holding, how-\never, the majority ignores the critical fact that the admissions\nprograms involved in Runyon—like Kamehameha’s- violated\n§ 1981 because they used race as the determinative admis-\nsions factor. Instead, the majority converts Runyon into a case\nabout a “whites-only admissions” program that is “inappo-\nsite” to Kamehameha’s Native Hawaiians-only admissions\npolicy. Id. I find the majority’s decision to dismiss Runyon in\norder to approve a policy that bars African American (and any\nother) children who lack Native Hawaiian ancestry to be\nunfortunate and wrong.\n\n   Putting those concerns aside for the moment, and turning\nto the next step in the majority’s analysis, the majority holds\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                   19107\nthat Title VII scrutiny, and not strict scrutiny, applies to\nalleged § 1981 violations. Maj. Op. at 19071-72. That second\nstep in the majority’s analysis is sound. Like the majority, I\nagree that Title VII standards and not strict scrutiny must\napply to § 1981 actions because to hold otherwise would\neffectively render the Title VII’s provisions that expressly\ncontemplate affirmative action plans nonsensical.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npursuant to an affirmative action plan, thereby rebutting the\npresumption of illegality. Thus, as the majority concludes,\nthis case hinges entirely on the third step of the McDonnell\nDouglas analysis—i.e., whether Kamehameha’s plan is\ninvalid. See Maj.

Further-\nmore, I also disagree with the majority’s application of its\nown standard.\n\n  A.   The Majority’s Modification of the Title VII Standard\n\n   The majority creates a standard that, by its own terms,\napplies only to primary and secondary schools. It grounds that\ndecision entirely on its finding that the ordinary Title VII\nstandard, which was developed in the employment setting,\ncannot apply to primary and secondary educational contracts.\nBut, there is absolutely nothing in § 1981’s text to suggest\nthat contracts made with “private employers [that] strive pri-\nmarily to make money[ ] and public employers [that] perform\na specific public function” should be subject to a different\nstandard than primary and secondary schools that have “a\nmuch broader [external] mission.” Maj. Op. at 19076. Indeed,\nthe majority neglects the fact that § 1981 guarantees to “[a]ll\npersons . . . the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a)\n(emphasis added). Given § 1981’s plain text, then, it is not\nsurprising that the majority cannot cite a single case to sup-\nport the novel proposition that primary and secondary educa-\ntional contracts are different from other contracts and are\nentitled to special treatment under § 1981.\n\f19110            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has rejected that very argument.\nFor instance, far from finding that a school’s “much broader\nmission” or external focus made a difference, Runyon—which\ninvolved a racially exclusive primary and secondary private\nschool admissions policy—reasoned:\n\n    It is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by\n    the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe’s Private\n    School amounts to a classic violation of § 1981.

[Plaintiffs] were\n    denied admission to the schools because of their\n    race. The . . . conclusion that § 1981 was thereby\n    violated follows inexorably from the language of\n    that statute, as construed in [prior Supreme Court\n    case law].\n\n427 U.S. at 172-73 (quotation and citation omitted) (footnote\nomitted). Thus, the majority’s argument that primary and sec-\nondary private school educational contracts should be treated\ndifferently from other contracts under § 1981 was squarely\nrejected in Runyon, and I would adhere to that precedent.\n\n   Similarly, the majority’s rationale does not find any support\nin Title VII jurisprudence. Indeed, under Title VII the\nSupreme Court has uniformly measured affirmative action\nprograms against the standard established in Weber as\nexplained above. For example, Johnson employed Weber to\ndetermine the validity of a county transportation agency’s\naffirmative action program under Title VII. 480 U.S. at 626-\n40; see also id. at 631 (“[W]e must first examine whether [the\nemployment] decision was made pursuant to a plan prompted\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        19111\nby concerns similar to those of the employer in Weber. Next,\nwe must determine whether the effect of the plan on [the non-\npreferred race] is comparable to the effect of the Plan in that\ncase.”); id. at 627 (“The assessment of the legality of the\nAgency Plan must be guided by our decision in Weber.”\n(footnote omitted)).\n\n   Our own jurisprudence has closely followed the Supreme\nCourt’s lead in this area, and, as the majority candidly con-\ncedes, under Title VII, we have always applied the same stan-\ndard, even when the program “at issue was not wholly\nanalogous to the hiring and promotional plans at issue in\nWeber and Johnson because of some significant conceptual\ndifferences between the types of plans,” Maj.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nimbalance in a particular job category in the employer’s work-\nforce; and (2) that this imbalance stems from historical segre-\ngation in that job category. Those separate requirements\nguaranteed two critical things: First, with respect to the scope\nof the program, they guaranteed that there was a particular\ngoal in sight—namely, representation of the historically dis-\nadvantaged group in the employer’s workforce in proportion\nto its representation in the relevant labor pool. Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 631-32, 633 n.10; Weber, 443 U.S. at 198-99, 208-09.\nBy requiring a goal based on the employer’s own practices,\nWeber and Johnson were willing to permit affirmative action\nprograms without giving all employers license to discriminate\nin favor of any group that currently finds itself disadvantaged\nanywhere in the labor market. Second, those requirements\nensured that there was a temporal constraint, a well-defined\npoint after which the preference program would no longer be\nnecessary—that is, once the “manifest imbalance” in the\nemployer’s workforce had been corrected. Johnson, 480 U.S.\nat 632 (“The requirement that ‘the manifest imbalance’ relate\nto a ‘traditionally segregated job category’ provides assurance\nboth that sex or race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII’s purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination, and that the interests of those\nemployees not benefiting from the plan will not be unduly\ninfringed.”); Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09 (“[T]he plan is a tem-\nporary measure; it is not intended to maintain racial balance,\nbut simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance. Preferen-\ntial selection of craft trainees at the Gramercy plant will end\nas soon as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the\nGramercy plant approximates the percentage of blacks in the\nlocal labor force.”). Moreover, an affirmative action program\nthat correlates to an employer’s own internal practices is nec-\nessarily limited in scope and time, because correcting the\n“manifest imbalance” is reasonably within the employer’s\ncontrol.\n\n  In contrast to Weber and Johnson, the majority’s test\nmerely requires a private school to “demonstrate that specific,\n\f                     DOE v.

Thus, by completely eliminating any school-\nbased analysis and jettisoning any historical inquiry,5 the\nmajority rejects the constraint developed in the Title VII con-\ntext that affirmative action programs must be limited in scope\nand duration. Indeed, the majority effectively green-lights dis-\ncrimination so long as the identified group currently suffers\nfrom “significant imbalances in educational achievement.” Id.\nat 19079. Because such a broad and perpetual license con-\nflicts with the Supreme Court’s consistent emphasis on the\nlimited and temporary nature of permissible affirmative action\nplans, see, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v.

Unnecessary Trammeling the Rights of the Non-\n    Preferred Group\n\n   The majority’s alteration of Weber and Johnson’s second\nfactor is similarly problematic. Under the second factor, an\naffirmative action plan must not “unnecessarily trammel[ ] the\nrights of [members of the disfavored group] or create[ ] an\nabsolute bar to their advancement.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 637-\n38; accord Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. The majority echoes this\ntest, Maj. Op. at 19077, but it makes two important modifica-\ntions.\n\n   First, under the majority’s test, whether a discriminatory\npolicy creates an absolute bar or unnecessarily trammels the\nrights of the disfavored race is determined by reference to\n“the respective rights of members of the non-preferred group”\n“viewed in the relevant community, rather than in a single\nschool.” Maj. Op. at 19077. Thus, under the majority’s new\nstandard, we must not consider the rights of a non-preferred\nindividual at the institution in question but in the larger con-\ntext of his ability to access quality education. See id. at 19077.\nAgain, as indicated above, that standard conflicts with the\nestablished principle that we look at the particular institution\nadopting the affirmative action program to determine whether\nthe rights of a member of the disfavored group have been\ntrammeled. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (“[W]hile peti-\ntioner in this case was denied a promotion, he retained his\nemployment with the Agency, at the same salary and with the\nsame seniority, and remained eligible for other promotions.”);\nid. at 638 n.15 (“Of the 111 new Skilled Craft jobs [at the\nAgency] during [the relevant] period, 105, or almost 95%,\nwent to men.”); id. at 642 (“The decision to [hire Joyce\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19117\ninstead of the plaintiff] was made pursuant to an affirmative\naction plan that represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case\napproach to effecting a gradual improvement in the represen-\ntation of minorities and women in the Agency’s work force.”\n(emphasis added)); Weber, 443 U.S. at 208 (“The plan does\nnot require the discharge of white workers and their replace-\nment with new black hirees. Nor does the plan create an abso-\nlute bar to the advancement of white employees; half of those\ntrained in the program will be white.” (citation omitted)).\n\n   Indeed, it is contrary to the spirit—and, I had always\nassumed, based on the cases cited above, the letter—of the\ncivil rights laws to explain to a worker who has been discrimi-\nnated against that the situation is not so bad because there are\nlots of other jobs available. Yet that is the essence of the\nmajority’s new standard: If the majority thinks there are ade-\nquate educational alternatives for the disfavored race, then the\nfact that the institution in question has discriminated against\nthat race is of no concern. “Context” alone cannot explain\nwhy, under the majority’s view, racial discrimination in some\ncommunities would be wrong and actionable, but in other\ncommunities, it would be acceptable and praiseworthy. I can-\nnot join the majority’s analysis.\n\n   The majority makes a second important modification and\nannounces that in determining whether an affirmative action\nplan trammels rights or creates an absolute bar, we do not\nlook at whether an individual has been denied an opportunity,\nbut whether the individual’s racial group “within the commu-\nnity as a whole” has been denied an opportunity. See Maj. Op.\nat 19080-81 (holding that because “nothing in the record sug-\ngests that educational opportunities in Hawaii are deficient for\nstudents, like Plaintiff, who lack any native Hawaiian ances-\ntry,” Kamehameha’s admissions “policy neither unnecessarily\ntrammels the rights of non-Native Hawaiians nor absolutely\nbars their advancement in the relevant community.” (empha-\nsis added)); id. at 19081 (holding that because “[non-Native\nHawaiian] students denied admission by Kamehameha\n\f19118                DOE v.

Op. at 19101. Because McDonald departed\nfrom Judge Fletcher’s plain-text reading of § 1981, he reasons that we\nshould reject the plain text of § 1981 altogether and turn to unrelated,\nrepealed legislation and the pronouncement of a single congressional com-\nmittee to interpret § 1981. Id. at 19101-02. What Judge Fletcher forgets,\nhowever, is that McDonald stands for exactly the opposite proposition,\nnamely that “the language and history of § 1981” demonstrate that\n“§ 1981 is applicable to racial discrimination in private employment\nagainst white persons.” 427 U.S. at 286-87 (emphasis added).

In\nShelley, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\nbecause courts could enforce racially restrictive covenants\nequally against both whites and African Americans, enforcing\na racially restrictive covenant against African Americans in\nthat case did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at\n21-22. In so holding, Shelley reasoned that because “[t]he\nrights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual . . . [i]t is\n. . . no answer to . . . say that the courts may also be induced\nto deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on\ngrounds of race or color.” Id. at 22. Indeed, “[e]qual protec-\ntion of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate impo-\nsition of inequalities.” Id. Contrary to Shelley, the majority\nholds that equality can be achieved “through indiscriminate\nimposition of inequalities.” Id.7\n\n   As there is no reason to depart from the plain meaning of\n§ 1981 or the framework espoused in Shelley, I would follow\nSupreme Court precedent by considering the rights of individ-\nuals, not of groups. Consequently, I cannot concur in the\nmajority’s modification of the second Weber and Johnson fac-\ntor.\n\n      3.   Attaining a Balance\n\n   Finally, the majority reworks the third Weber and Johnson\nfactor, which requires that an affirmative action plan be “in-\n  7\n   The majority’s reasoning cannot be limited to the § 1981 context.\nIndeed, if equality can only be achieved through inequality, it is unclear\nwhy the majority’s rationale would not apply with equal force to employ-\nment, housing, or public schools.\n\f                 DOE v.

Though the\nSupreme Court has not required that all affirmative action\nprograms contain an explicit end date, Johnson also holds\nthat, “Express assurance that a program is only temporary\nmay be necessary if the program actually sets aside positions\naccording to specific numbers.” 480 U.S. at 639-40. Indeed,\nin such cases, a sunset provision is “necessary both to mini-\nmize the effect of the program on other employees, and to\nensure that the plan’s goals ‘[are] not being used simply to\nachieve and maintain . . . balance.’ ” Id. at 640 (quoting\nWeber, 478 U.S. at 477-78); accord Taxman v.

Op. at 19082; accord id. at 19077. Pro-\nclaiming that “[a]n explicit or immediately foreseeable end\ndate has never been required for an affirmative action plan to\nbe valid,” Maj. Op. at 19083, however, the majority com-\npletely ignores Johnson’s suggestion that even a partial pref-\nerence should be checked by an explicit sunset provision, by\nholding that Kamehameha’s absolute preference need not\ncontain a sunset provision at all, see Maj. Op. at 19082 (hold-\ning that Kamehameha may use race as an exclusive admis-\nsions factor “so long as is necessary to remedy the current\neducational effects of past, private, and government-\nsponsored discrimination and of social and economic depriva-\ntion”); id. at 19079 (“The goal [of Kamehameha’s admissions\n\f19122            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npolicy] is to bring Native Hawaiian students into educational\nparity with other ethnic groups in Hawaii.”); see also id. at\n19082 (noting that in the last “118 years, the Schools’ admis-\nsions policy . . . has remained constant”). The majority thus\nnot only rejects Johnson but also the Court’s admonishment\nthat “race-conscious admissions policies . . . however compel-\nling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they . . .\nmust have reasonable durational limits.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n342 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted); accord\nid. (“The requirement that all race-conscious admissions pro-\ngrams have a termination point assure[s] all citizens that the\ndeviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and\nethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the\nservice of the goal of equality itself.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n   Far from placing a durational limit on Kamehameha’s use\nof race as a dispositive admissions factor, the majority actu-\nally sanctions the use of race in perpetuity. For example, since\nfew, if any, private parties will be able to correct “significant\nimbalances in educational achievement” in the entire “target\npopulation” through their own individual action, the majori-\nty’s standard effectively issues private schools a license to\nengage in perpetual racial discrimination. Because such a lim-\nitless use of race in determining admissions contravenes pre-\ncedent, the majority’s retooling of Johnson and Weber’s third\nfactor is also unsound.\n\nB.   Applying the Majority’s Standard to Kamehameha\n\n   Even if I were to agree with the majority’s modifications to\nthe Supreme Court’s Title VII standard, I could not agree with\nits application of that standard in this case.\n\n     1. A Manifest Imbalance Presently Affecting the Target\n     Population\n\n  Under the majority’s modified first factor, “to justify a\nremedial racial preference, a private school must demonstrate\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS               19123\nthat specific, significant imbalances in educational achieve-\nment presently affect the target population” in the relevant\ncommunity. Maj. Op. 19077. I have explained above in Part\nI.A.1. why the majority’s test is fundamentally flawed and\nconflicts with precedent. The majority’s modifications—\neliminating any focus on the schools’ own population and any\nreliance on historical practices—relieves Kamehameha of the\nburden of demonstrating its policy is limited in scope and\nduration. For the reasons I explain in the next two sections,\nKamehameha’s affirmative action program fails both inqui-\nries. Nevertheless, under the majority’s modest thesis, Kame-\nhameha’s admissions policy arguably survives the first\nrevised factor because it is clear that Native Hawaiians suffer\nfrom significant imbalances in educational achievement rela-\ntive to most other ethnic groups in Hawaii.\n\n    2. Unnecessarily Trammel the Rights of the Non-\n    Preferred Racial Group\n\n   Under the majority’s second prong, “we ask whether,\nwithin the relevant community of Hawaii, the Kamehameha\nSchools’ admissions policy unnecessarily trammels the rights\nof the non-preferred class, that is, students with no Hawaiian\nancestry or creates an absolute bar to their advancement.”\nMaj. Op. at 19080. The majority holds that Kamehameha does\nnot run afoul of this prong because: (1) “[t]he history of\nNative Hawaiians and of Kamehameha Schools has certain\nunique features that Congress has acknowledged”; (2) “noth-\ning in the record suggests that educational opportunities in\nHawaii are deficient for [non-Native Hawaiian] students”; (3)\nnon-Native Hawaiians have no “legitimate, firmly rooted\nexpectation of admission to the Schools”; and (4) “Kameha-\nmeha allows all students to apply for admission,” though\n“once the applications are received, the Schools consider the\nethnic background of the students and admit qualified chil-\ndren with Native Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children\nwith no such ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19080-82. None of these\n\f19124                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nexplanations is sufficient to justify Kamehameha’s admissions\npolicy even under the revised standard.\n\n   For example, the majority’s first finding is irrelevant. The\nmere fact that “Congress admitted that the United States was\nresponsible, in part, for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monar-\nchy” and that Congress has recognized “the challenge faced\nby Native Hawaiians in the educational arena” and has urged\nKamehameha to “redouble its efforts to educate Native\nHawaiian children,” Maj. Op. at 19081 (quoting H.R. REP.\nNO. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001)), says absolutely nothing about\nwhether Kamehameha’s policy unnecessarily trammels rights\nor creates an absolute bar. Moreover, the statements the\nmajority relies on also say nothing about whether Congress\nhas ever been aware of Kamehameha’s no non-Native Hawai-\nians policy, let alone endorsed it. Indeed, it is unreasonable to\nconclude, as the majority does, that by briefly endorsing the\nschools’ larger educational goals in a committee report that\ndoes not even accompany a piece of legislation, Congress\nintended to sanction the requirements of an otherwise infirm\naffirmative action plan.8\n  8\n   Indeed, considered in total, the paragraph that the majority relies on\nprovides remarkably little support for its position:\n      The Committee has also eliminated [certain of] the Native\n      Hawaiian specific programs formerly authorized . . . . The Com-\n      mittee’s rationale for repealing these programs is the fact that\n      similar assistance is available to all students, including Native\n      Hawaiians, under [other federal] programs . . . . Unlike other\n      indigenous populations, Native Hawaiians have a trust, estab-\n      lished by the last Hawaiian princess, which exists solely to edu-\n      cate Native Hawaiian children. The Bishop Trust is currently one\n      of the largest charitable trusts in the world, valued in excess of\n      $ 10 billion, and holds approximately 8 percent of all land in the\n      State of Hawaii as well as a 10 percent share of Goldman Sachs.\n      The Committee urges the Trust to redouble its efforts to educate\n      Native Hawaiian children. The Committee also believes that\n      these children should be given the same opportunities afforded to\n      all of our children under the programs authorized in this and\n      other acts.\nH.R. REP. NO. 107-63(I), at 333 (2001).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                      19125\n   The majority’s second finding—that non-Native Hawaiians\nhave other educational opportunities—also fails to justify the\nmajority’s holding that Kamehameha’s admissions policy\ndoes not create an absolute bar or trammel the rights of the\nnon-preferred race. In fact, as I have previously discussed, at\npp. 19116-20, supra, I believe that considering non-Native\nHawaiians’ alternatives in this way is unsound under prevail-\ning civil rights case law. But even neglecting that fact, such\nreliance is particularly problematic here. Kamehameha has an\nillustrious network of alumni and a record of success that\nexceeds that of any other school in Hawaii. The tremendous\ntrust corpus of the Bishop Foundation enables Kamehameha\nto offer this excellent education at a severely discounted\nprice; as the majority notes, the cost of educating each student\napproaches $20,000 annually, but tuition at Kamehameha is\nless than 10% of this figure, and most students receive finan-\ncial aid. See Maj. Op. at 19057-58. No other school in Hawaii\noffers the same benefits at such low cost. Thus, the majority’s\nsecond justification flies in the face of logic and cannot justify\nthe majority’s holding.\n\n  I find the majority’s next finding—that because for the last\n“118 years, the Schools’ admissions policy . . . has remained\nconstant,” non-Native Hawaiians have no “legitimate, firmly\nrooted expectation of admission to the Schools,” Maj. Op. at\n19082 (citation omitted)—to be unavailing.9 In other words,\n   9\n     Moreover, the majority ignores what Johnson actually said. The plain-\ntiff in that case was eligible for promotion but he had to compete with\nseven other applicants who could have been promoted over him. 480 U.S.\nat 638. Accordingly, he did not have a “firmly rooted expectation” in the\nposition he was denied. Id. (“[P]etitioner had no absolute entitlement to\nthe road dispatcher position. Seven of the applicants were classified as\nqualified and eligible, and the Agency Director was authorized to promote\nany of the seven. Thus, denial of the promotion unsettled no legitimate,\nfirmly rooted expectation on the part of petitioner.” (emphasis added)).\nNowhere did Johnson hold, as the majority concludes, however, that\nknowledge of a long-standing discriminatory policy justifies discrimina-\ntory decisions made pursuant to that policy.\n\f19126            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\naccording to the majority, because non-Native Hawaiians\nhave been discriminated against on the basis of their race for\na long time, they have no cause of action under § 1981. This\nview is contrary to history and logic. Perhaps more than any\nother enactments in our history, the Fourteenth Amendment\nand the civil rights acts unsettled the expectations of an entire\nnation accustomed to judging people by their race. Surely the\nschools in Runyon would have found no defense by arguing\nthat their exclusionary policies were open and notorious and\nthat African-American students had “no expectation of admis-\nsion to the Schools.” Maj. Op. at 19082. Advising non-Native\nHawaiians that they have no possibility of admission to\nKamehameha may settle their expectations, but it does not—\nfor that reason—make the policy lawful.\n\n   Lastly, the majority’s final justification for holding that\nKamehameha’s admissions policy does not unnecessarily\ntrammel rights or create an absolute bar is absolutely wrong.\nThe majority begins by noting that “[t]he Kamehameha\nSchools allow all students to apply for admission. But once\nthe applications are received, the Schools consider the ethnic\nbackground of the students and admit qualified children with\nNative Hawaiian ancestry before admitting children with no\nsuch ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19080; accord id. at 19082-83\n(noting, “if qualified students with Native Hawaiian ancestry\ndo not apply to the School in sufficient numbers to fill the\nspots available, as happened in one recent year, the Schools’\npolicy is to open admissions to any qualified candidate. (foot-\nnote omitted) (emphasis added)). The majority then notes, in\na bit of an understatement, that, “[b]ecause the pool of quali-\nfied potential students with Native Hawaiian blood greatly\noutnumbers the available slots at the Schools, non-Native\nHawaiians generally are not admitted.” Id. at 19080. High-\nlighting the understated nature of its conclusion, the majority\nthen proceeds to drop a footnote explaining that its euphemis-\ntic phrase “generally are not admitted” means that, from 1962\nuntil 2002, Kamehameha admitted exactly one student who\nwas not of Native Hawaiian descent. Id. at 19080 n.10.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19127\n   Proceeding as if its statement that Kamehameha generally\ndoes not admit non-Native Hawaiians proves that Kamehame-\nha’s policy is not an absolute bar, the majority entirely\nneglects to mention the circumstances surrounding the admis-\nsion of that lone non-Native Hawaiian student. Because those\ncircumstances speak volumes about Kamehameha’s policy,\nhowever, they deserve an extended discussion.\n\n   In 1962, Kamehameha reversed its previous policy of\nallowing the children of faculty members to attend. Thereaf-\nter, the school did not admit a single non-Native Hawaiian\nstudent until 2002, when it admitted one non-Native Hawaiian\nstudent to its Maui campus. In response to a firestorm of pro-\ntests following that decision, Kamehameha’s trustees repeat-\nedly apologized to the Native Hawaiian community, stated\nthat the “situation” had “brought the problems with the admis-\nsions process into sharp focus,” Members of Trs. of Kameha-\nmeha Sch., Kamehameha’s Policy Will Remain, HONOLULU\nADVERTISER, July 27, 2002, and acknowledged that they had\n“screwed up major,” Rick Daysog, Angry Ohana Grills Trust-\nees, HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN, July 16, 2002. “As a result,”\nthe trustees “pledged to . . . carefully review [Kamehameha’s]\nadmissions process,” Members of Bd. of Trs. of Kamehameha\nSch., supra, presumably to prevent such a “situation” from\nhappening again.\n\n   Far from an empty promise, Kamehameha promptly made\nseveral significant changes to its admission practices. First, it\ncreated the Ho’oulu Hawaiian Data Center to develop a\nNative Hawaiian registry and certify the Hawaiian ancestry of\nthe schools’ applicants; to be considered under the school’s\npreference policy, an applicant’s ancestry must now be veri-\nfied by the data center.10 Second, Kamehameha temporarily\n  10\n    I note that in 2003, Kamehameha admitted a student to its seventh\ngrade class whose application identified his maternal grandfather as\nNative Hawaiian. One week before school was set to begin, Kamehameha\nlearned that the student’s mother was adopted and probably lacked biolog-\n\f19128                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nwaived application fees for its Maui and Big Island campuses\nin order to induce more Native Hawaiians to apply for admis-\nsion. Third, Kamehameha further increased the number of\nNative Hawaiians applying to its Big Island campus by allow-\ning certain students, who had previously only been eligible for\nadmission to its main campus in O’ahu, to apply for admis-\nsion at the Big Island campus.11 Fourth, Kamehameha also\nceased its preliminary screening for O’ahu and Big Island\napplicants.\n\n   And fifth, Kamehameha ceased using a minimum scoring\nthreshold to evaluate applicants. Since 1989, Kamehameha\nhad required applicants to achieve a minimum composite\nscore on an admissions test in order to be deemed “qualified\napplicants.” Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Standards Debated,\nHONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. Though that test\nwas hardly an impediment to the school’s preference policy—\nas 2002 marked the first time in four decades that the school\nhad space to admit a non-Native Hawaiian student—it did at\nleast provide an objective way to measure the number of qual-\nified Native Hawaiian applicants. By eliminating that test,\nhowever, Kamehameha did away with that objective measure,\nwhile leaving in place “Kamehameha Schools’ admissions\npolicy . . . to give preference to applicants of Hawaiian ances-\n\nical Hawaiian ancestry. Kamehameha immediately rescinded the student’s\nacceptance. Ultimately, Kamehameha settled the case and agreed to allow\nthe student to complete his education at Kamehameha. See David Waite,\nBoy Sues Kamehameha, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 19, 2003, at 1B;\nDavid Waite & Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Settles Kaua’i Boy’s Lawsuit,\nHONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 29, 2003, at 1A; see also Vicki Viotti &\nMike Gordon, Kamehameha Settlement OK’d, HONOLULU ADVERTISER,\nDec. 5, 2003, at 1B (stating that the district court indicated it believed that,\nlegally, the boy was Native Hawaiian).\n   11\n      Kamehameha’s flagship campus on O’ahu receives approximately ten\napplications for every available opening, so reducing its applicant pool did\nnot present the danger that the school would not receive enough qualified\nNative Hawaiian applicants.\n\f                 DOE v.

Thus,\nbecause that policy provides no objective guidance whatso-\never, Kamehameha’s decision leaves it free to restrict admis-\nsion solely to Native Hawaiian children, and as the trustees\npromised, Kamehameha need never admit a non-Native\nHawaiian applicant again. This description is not meant to\ncriticize Kamehameha’s noble mission to help Native Hawai-\nians receive a quality education, but only to demonstrate that\nits current policy—contrary to the majority’s creative\ncharacterization—does pose an absolute bar to the admittance\nof any non-Native Hawaiian students. And, such bar violates\nsection 1981.\n\n    3. Do No More Than Is Necessary to Correct a\n    Manifest Imbalance\n\n   Similarly, I must dissent from the majority’s analysis under\nits third prong. Under that prong, as modified by the majority,\nKamehameha’s “admissions policy must do no more than is\nnecessary to correct the manifest imbalance suffered by stu-\ndents of Native Hawaiian ancestry.” Maj. Op. at 19082. To\nhold that Kamehameha’s admissions policy survives this fac-\ntor, the majority asserts that Kamehameha’s policy is both\nflexible and limited. Id. at 19082-83. As for the former, the\nmajority finds that Kamehameha’s admissions policy “does\nnot do more than is necessary” because that “policy is not\nfixed but changes as the capacity of the Schools’ programs\nincreases and as the well-being of the Native Hawaiian com-\nmunity rises.” Maj. Op. at 19082. The majority fails to pro-\nvide any support for that conclusion, and that lack of support\nis far from surprising given that, as demonstrated above,\nKamehameha has only made its race based admissions pro-\ngram more rigid, see supra at pp. 19127-28.\n\n  The majority also finds that Kamehameha’s admissions\npolicy is “limited in duration” by the fact that “if qualified\n\f19130               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nstudents with Native Hawaiian ancestry do not apply to the\nSchool in sufficient numbers to fill the spots available, as hap-\npened in one recent year, the Schools’ policy is to open\nadmissions to any qualified candidate” and the admissions\npolicy will end when “the current educational effects of past,\nprivate and government-sponsored discrimination and of\nsocial and economic deprivation” end.

Because, as the majority candidly con-\ncedes, “there are many more qualified students of Hawaiian\nancestry than there are available places at the Schools,” id. at\n19058, and Kamehemeha altered its admissions criteria in\nresponse to what “happened in one recent year,” id. at 19082,\nit is unclear whether Kamehameha will ever admit another\nnon-Native Hawaiian student, let alone end its racially exclu-\nsive admissions policy. I cannot understand how Kamehame-\nha’s policy can reasonably be described as “limited in\nduration.”12\n\n   As Kamehameha’s own trustees put it, “[Our policy] must\nremain [in place] until Hawaiians are leading in scholastic\nachievement, until they are underrepresented in prisons and\nhomeless shelters, until their well-being is restored.” Trs. of\nKamehameha Sch., Kamehameha Schools’ Policy Advocates\nSocial Justice, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Aug. 24, 2003. And,\naccording to its website, “Kamehameha Schools’ mission is to\nfulfill Pauahi’s desire to create educational opportunities in\n   12\n      Moreover, Kamehameha’s own admissions policy may help perpetu-\nate that policy indefinitely. Because Kamehameha bases its admissions\ndecisions heavily on an applicant’s prior academic performance it selects\nthe highest-performing Native Hawaiian students from the public school\npopulation, and that necessarily depresses that population’s average per-\nformance in public schools. See Vicki Viotti, Kamehameha Standards\nDebated, HONOLULU ADVERTISER, Nov. 17, 2003, at 1B. By continually\npassing over the lower performers, the Native Hawaiian population will\nlikely continue to underperform in public schools relative to its peers. If\n“preference [may] be given . . . for so long as is necessary to remedy the\ncurrent educational effects,” Maj Op. at 19082, Kamehameha’s policy has\nno reasonable end in sight.\n\f                  DOE v.

Because such a per-\npetual use of race in admissions has no limit, I cannot join the\nmajority in holding that Kamehameha’s admissions policy\ndoes no more than is necessary and therefore survives the\nmodified third factor.\n\n                           *****\n\n   The Supreme Court has long warned that “[c]lassifications\nof [persons] solely on the basis of race . . . threaten to stigma-\ntize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial\ngroup and to incite racial hostility.” Shaw v.

Nothing in the majority’s opinion reassures me that\nKamehameha has made that effort, and I must dissent from\nthe majority’s analysis.\n\n        II.   CONGRESSIONAL EXEMPTION OF\n              KAMEHAMEHA FROM § 1981\n\n   As an additional justification for its decision, the majority\nasserts that Kamehameha’s policy does not violate § 1981\nbecause Congress implicitly exempted racial preferences for\nNative Hawaiians from § 1981’s coverage. The majority,\njoined to some extent by Judge Fletcher’s concurrence,\naccomplishes this with three premises: First, the majority rea-\nsons that because § 1981 was enacted in 1870, prior to the\nacquisition of Hawaii, “Congress could not have had any con-\nscious intention as to how [§ 1981] would apply in Hawaii.”\nMaj. Op. at 19085. Second, “Congress reenacted § 1981 in\n1991.” Id. at 19088. Third, “Congress has passed [legislation]\nspecifically affecting Native Hawaiians both before and after\n\f19132            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n1991,” and to read these acts “consistently with the revised\nversion of § 1981,” we must read an exemption for Native\nHawaiians into § 1981. Id. at 19086-87. Indeed, according to\nthe majority, this is “the most plausible reading of § 1981.”\nId. at 19089.\n\n   Each of the majority’s premises is either demonstrably\nwrong or utterly irrelevant. First, the majority’s claim that\n“Congress could not have had any conscious intention as to\nhow [§ 1981] would apply in Hawaii” is just plain wrong.\nMaj. Op. at 19085. As the majority observes, when Congress\nfirst enacted § 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1870,\nthe Hawaiian Islands were still a sovereign kingdom whose\npeople remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States.\nThe United States did not annex Hawaii until the 1890s. See\nMaj. Op. at 19056, 19085. It is clear, then, that Congress\ncould not have initially intended either to cover or to exempt\nNative Hawaiians from § 1981’s provisions. But nothing\nmore can be gleaned from this fact. The majority reads a dif-\nferent point into this history: That we do not know how Con-\ngress intended § 1981 to apply in Hawaii. This is nonsensical\nand flies in the face of, among other things, § 1981 itself, the\nHawaiian Statehood Act, the equal footing doctrine, and the\nSupremacy Clause.\n\n   Hawaii and its citizens have been subject to § 1981 since\nHawaii became a territory because § 1981 applies to “[a]ll\npersons with the jurisdiction of the United States,” including\n“every State and Territory.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) (2000). Con-\ngress reaffirmed this when Hawaii became a state in 1959 and\njoined the Union with all of the privileges and duties of all of\nthe other states, that is, on an “equal footing,” as if it had\njoined the Union at its founding.

In other\nwords, § 1981 has long applied in Hawaii and on exactly the\nsame terms as it applies elsewhere within the United States.\n\n   Second, building from its first faulty premise, the majority\ninsists that § 1981 was “reenacted” in 1991. See Maj. Op. at\n19085 (“The 1991 amendments are . . . the only[ ] time since\nHawaii became a state that Congress has reenacted § 1981.”\n(emphasis added); id. at 19085 (“Congress . . . reenacted\n§ 1981 in 1991.”); id. at 19086-87 (“. . . the pre-1991 statu-\ntory landscape . . . informs us about what Congress had in\nmind when it reenacted § 1981”); id. at 19088 (“. . .

It wasn’t.\nRather, § 1981 was amended in 1991 by adding two provi-\nsions; not one word of § 1981’s original text was touched by\nthose amendments. Indeed, every word that Congress wrote in\n1870 and that was codified in 1874—and was there in 1898\nwhen Hawaii was annexed and in 1959 when Hawaii became\na state—is still there.\n\n   In 1991, Congress amended § 1981 in two respects: It codi-\nfied the Court’s holding in Runyon that § 1981 applies to dis-\ncrimination by private actors, see 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c), and it\nstatutorily overruled the Court’s holding in Patterson v.\nMcLean Credit Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112296\"><a href=\"/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), that § 1981 does\nnot extend to post-contract-formation conduct, such as the\nimposition of discriminatory working conditions, see 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(b).13 See also Jones v.

It is beyond dispute that Congress has enacted\nnumerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for\nNative Hawaiians, but nothing in those acts says anything\nabout § 1981, much less exempts Native Hawaiians from its\ncoverage.

Op. at 19087-88;\nConc. Op. at 19098. Those Amendments direct the Secretary\n\f19138               DOE v.

L. No. 100-297,\ntit. IV, § 4005(a), 102 Stat. 360 (1988). A directive to give\nKamehameha a grant for a demonstration program does not\ncreate an exemption from generally applicable civil rights\nlaws.15 Furthermore, nothing in Stafford-Hawkins would be\ninconsistent with enforcement of § 1981 in this case. In fact,\nit could not be since Congress repealed the demonstration\ngrant program before the sunset provision took effect, Pub. L.\nNo. 103-382, tit. III, § 363, 108 Stat. 3975 (1994), and a cur-\nrent version of the act only mentions Kamehameha in the\nfindings of fact. 20 U.S.C. § 7512(16) (2002).\n\n   Judge Fletcher goes a step farther than the majority, argu-\ning that the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments and the Public\nHealth Service Act “specifically directed Kamehameha\nSchools to do precisely what plaintiffs in this case say is for-\nbidden by § 1981.” Conc. Op. at 19098. I cannot see how\n“ ‘mak[ing] grants to [Kamehameha] for a demonstration pro-\n  15\n     Whether Congress appropriated money to Kamehameha has no bear-\ning on whether it thought that Kamehameha was in compliance with a\nwholly unrelated statute. It is easy to generate examples which clearly\nillustrate this: Before 2003, professors at the University of Michigan\nreceived numerous federal grants from the National Institutes of Health\nand the National Science Foundation, but this did not indicate that either\nCongress or the President believed Michigan’s admissions policy was con-\nstitutional; indeed, the Department of Justice filed amicus briefs in Gratz\nand Grutter arguing just the opposite. Similarly, no one would argue that\nCongress, by granting federal aid or favorable tax treatment to certain cor-\nporations (such as Texaco), intended to grant those corporations exemp-\ntions from federal antidiscrimination laws, cf. Smith v. Texaco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"26454\"><a href=\"/opinion/26454/smith-v-texaco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2002). Nor would anyone argue that Congress, by allo-\ncating funds to state or local police departments, somehow evinces an\nintent to exempt such departments from the purview of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThese examples clearly demonstrate both the absurdity and the danger\ninherent in using such unrelated statutes to draw broad conclusions about\nCongress’s inner mind.\n\f                      DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         19139\ngram to provide Higher Education fellowship assistance to\nNative Hawaiian students’ ” or “ ‘provid[ing] funds to\n[Kamehameha] for the purpose of providing scholarship assis-\ntance’ to eligible Native Hawaiian students” constitutes a spe-\ncific instruction from Congress to Kamehameha to apply a\nracially exclusive admissions policy.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nmere exhortation that Kamehameha should “redouble [its]\nefforts to provide for Native Hawaiians,” id., does not, as the\nmajority’s reasoning would have it, equal legislation, duly\nenacted, that “Kamehameha may continue to provide for\nNative Hawaiians, in violation of existing civil rights laws, if\nnecessary.” In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that either\nhouse of Congress, or even any subset of its membership,\nknew about—let alone approved of—Kamehameha’s absolute\nban on non-Native Hawaiian students. Thus, the Hawkins-\nStafford Amendments and the House committee report do not\noperate as some kind of estoppel against applying generally\napplicable civil rights laws to Native Hawaiians generally or\nto Kamehameha in particular.\n\n   Finally, from this thin record, the majority concludes that\n“the most plausible” way to harmonize these acts with the “re-\nenactment” of § 1981 is to infer that “Congress intended that\na preference for Native Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native\nHawaiian organization, located on the Hawaiian monarchy’s\nancestral lands, be upheld.” Maj. Op. at 19089. Mere recita-\ntion of the conclusion should remind us of Justice Jackson’s\n“restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.”\nSmith v.

In any event, there is no need to harmonize these\nstatutes because there is no inconsistency. A straightforward\nreading of § 1981 does not render any other legislation non-\nsensical, void, or superfluous. The fact that Congress has\npassed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education\nsays nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt\nNative Hawaiian schools from § 1981; there is no legislative\nconflict to reconcile.18 See Morton v. Mancari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n  18\n    The majority’s reliance on Runyon in this instance is misplaced. See\nMaj. Op. at 19085 (“In Runyon, for instance, the Court relied on Congress’\nenactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights legislation\nin concluding that Congress must have intended § 1981 to reach private\nacts of discrimination.”). Runyon discussed the passage of the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972 because, while considering that act,\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       19141\n551 (1974) (“The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose\namong congressional enactments, and when two statutes are\ncapable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a\nclearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to\nregard each as effective.”).\n\n   Unfortunately, the majority’s reasoning reaches far beyond\nKamehameha, and in finding that Native Hawaiians prefer-\nences are exempt from § 1981, the majority holds that by\namending that statute in 1991, Congress narrowed the scope\nof one of our oldest and most enduring civil rights statutes.\nSee Maj. Op. at 19085-87 (using the enactments outlined\nabove to “interpret[ ] the scope of § 1981”). Moreover, the\nmajority’s focus on what Congress may have been thinking\nignores what Congress actually did: It passed § 1981, a non-\ndiscrimination law of general applicability. Section 1981, on\nits face, clearly does not create any exemptions for Native\nHawaiians; thus, whether or not Congress meant to create\nsuch an exemption—and again, there is absolutely no indica-\ntion that it intended to do so—it certainly did not create such\nan exception.

Babbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741819\"><a href=\"/opinion/741819/97-cal-daily-op-serv-3982-97-daily-journal-dar-6755-thomas-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660 (9th\nCir. 1997) (“Congress may well have thought that, by passing\nthe [Reindeer Industry] Act, it was effectively precluding any-\none other than natives from entering the reindeer business.\nNevertheless, nothing in the Act actually prohibits non-\nnatives from entering the Reindeer business . . . .”).\n\n   To my mind, the disparate statutes favoring Native Hawai-\nians that the majority relies on demonstrate a different point\n\nCongress specifically considered repealing § 1981 to the extent that it\napplied to racial discrimination by private employers. See 427 U.S. at 173-\n75. The Runyon Court was considering whether § 1981 applied to private\nacts of racial discrimination, and that debate provided clear evidence that\nCongress believed that § 1981 applied to contracts between private parties.\nRunyon provides no support for inferring an exception for Native Hawai-\nians in § 1981 merely because Congress has “provide[d] specifically for\ntheir welfare in a number of different contexts.” Maj.

Nothing in the statutory language\nor legislative history of § 1981 even hints that Congress\nwanted to exempt Native Hawaiian preferences from its pro-\nvisions. Finding an exemption here is beyond any accepted\nmethod of statutory interpretation.19\n  19\n     The majority’s new statutory metaphysics raises far more questions\nthan it answers: How many provisions favoring Native Hawaiians must\nCongress pass before we will imply an exemption to § 1981? Would one\nact favoring Native Hawaiians somehow establish a lower level of scrutiny\nfor Native Hawaiian preferences, and a subsequent act completely exempt\nsuch preferences—or was the exemption granted in one fell swoop? How\nmight Congress go about removing this exemption; how many acts have\nto be repealed in order to repeal this exemption? If Congress had wanted\nNative Hawaiians to be covered by § 1981, must it have expressly\nincluded them? Who else is exempted from § 1981 under the majority’s\nlogic?\n  There is no end to this game.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 19143\n   If Congress wishes to exempt preferences for Native\nHawaiians from § 1981, it may do so. Until then, however, we\nought to apply the law as written. And as written, § 1981\nclearly encompasses Kamehameha’s racially exclusive admis-\nsions policy.\n\n   III.   NATIVE HAWAIIANS, MANCARI, AND THE\n          SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP DOCTRINE\n\n   Judge Fletcher raises an interesting variation on the last\nargument. Like the majority, the concurrence concludes that\nracial preferences on behalf of Native Hawaiians are exempt\nfrom § 1981. However, Judge Fletcher arrives at this result\nvia a slightly different route: First, he reasons that Native\nHawaiian status is both a political and a racial classification.\nConc. Op. at 19090 He then suggests that, under the “special\nrelationship” doctrine, Congress has given Native Hawaiians\nspecial benefits based on their political status. Id. at 19090-\n92. From that, Judge Fletcher then postulates that because\nCongress has given Native Hawaiians special benefits, it\ncould not have intended to prohibit private parties from doing\nthe exact same thing. Id. at 19094. Thus, according to the con-\ncurrence, § 1981, which prohibits racial preferences in private\ncontracts, must be read to exempt preferences on behalf of\nNative Hawaiians. Id. at 19102.\n\n   To establish his beginning premises, Judge Fletcher must\nrely on Morton v. Mancari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), which cre-\nated the “special relationship” doctrine. In Mancari, the\nSupreme Court held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs’s\n(“BIA”) hiring preference for Native Americans did not con-\nstitute racial discrimination. 417 U.S. at 553-54. Instead, the\nCourt wrote that the preference was “not directed towards a\n‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it applies only\nto members of ‘federally recognized’ tribes.” Id. at 553 n.24.\nThe Court concluded that this preference was therefore not a\nracial preference at all, but instead a political preference, and\napplied rational basis scrutiny. Id. Judge Fletcher would con-\n\f19144               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nclude that, under Mancari, Congress has the power to exempt\nprivate parties’ racial preferences in favor of Native Hawai-\nians from the purview of § 1981. Conc. Op. at 19095.\n\n   Before discussing the merits of the concurrence’s reason-\ning, I note that Kamehameha did not make this argument on\nappeal, and it was not briefed by either party. Kamehameha\ndid argue, as the majority concludes, that preferences in favor\nof Native Hawaiians are exempt from § 1981; however, it did\nnot base its argument on the special trust doctrine espoused in\nMancari. In fact, Kamehameha’s brief does not even cite Man-\ncari.20 Because arguments not made in a party’s appellate\nbrief are waived, see Blanford v. Sacramento County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790155\"><a href=\"/opinion/790155/matthew-aaron-blanford-v-sacramento-county-lou-blanas-sacramento-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1114 n.8 (9th Cir. 2005); Paladin Assocs., Inc. v.\nMont. Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781954\"><a href=\"/opinion/781954/paladin-associates-inc-a-montana-corporation-marie-g-owens-dba-paladin/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1164 (9th Cir. 2003), it is\nimproper for the court to even consider the argument raised\nby Judge Fletcher.\n\n   Nonetheless, turning to the merits, Judge Fletcher’s argu-\nment puts more weight on Mancari than it can bear. As I\nexplain in greater detail below, the exception in Mancari is an\nexceedingly narrow one, limited to preferences that are politi-\ncal not racial. Second, Mancari’s special relationship works\nonly in those cases where Congress has formally recognized\nthe sovereignty of Native American tribes. Despite opportu-\nnity to do so, Congress has never formally recognized the\nsovereignty of Native Hawaiians. Third, even if Congress had\nrecognized Native Hawaiians as a sovereign body, the special\nrelationship doctrine applies only to preferences by the federal\ngovernment or by the tribes themselves. It does not apply to\nprivate parties discriminating on the basis of tribal status;\nindeed, we have been quite clear that such private racial dis-\ncrimination remains illegal.\n  20\n    In light of the narrowness of the Mancari exception, which I discuss\nbelow, it is easy to see why Kamehameha decided that it was better off\nusing its scarce brief space and oral argument time to pursue other argu-\nments.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                19145\n   First, Judge Fletcher agrees with the majority that “ ‘Native\nHawaiians’ . . . is a racial classification.” Conc. Op. at 19090;\nsee Maj. Op. at 19067 n.9. But Judge Fletcher goes one step\nfurther, suggesting that “ ‘Native Hawaiians’ is not merely a\nracial classification,” but “also a political classification.” Id.\nat 19091. If Judge Fletcher is correct, this case, from the out-\nset, does not come within the special relationship doctrine of\nMorton v. Mancari because Mancari denied the very premise\nfrom which the concurring opinion proceeds. For instance,\nMancari held that the BIA’s Native American hiring prefer-\nence “does not constitute ‘racial discrimination.’ ” 417 U.S. at\n553. “Indeed, it is not even a ‘racial’ preference.” Id. As the\nCourt explained:\n\n    The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not\n    as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of\n    quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activi-\n    ties are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion. In\n    the sense that there is no other group of people\n    favored in this manner, the legal status of the BIA is\n    truly sui generis.\n\n417 U.S. at 554 (citation omitted). Moreover, in concluding\nthat the preference was political and not racial, the Court\nrelied on the fact that the beneficiaries were members of fed-\nerally recognized tribes:\n\n    The preference is not directed towards a ‘racial’\n    group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it applies only\n    to members of ‘federally recognized tribes.’ This\n    operates to exclude many individuals who are\n    racially to be classified as ‘Indians.’ In this sense,\n    the preference is political rather than racial in nature.\n\nId. at 553 n.24 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the\nSupreme Court explained in Rice v. Cayetano, “[a]lthough the\nclassification [in Mancari] had a racial component, the Court\nfound it important that the preference was not directed\n\f19146             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntowards a racial group consisting of Indians, but rather only\nto members of federally recognized tribes. In this sense, the\nCourt held, the preference was political rather than racial in\nnature.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519-20 (2000) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n   Here, Judge Fletcher agrees that, whatever else Kamehame-\nha’s admissions policy may be, it is a racial classification.\nThis fact places Kamehameha’s policy outside the scope of\nMancari’s holding. The distinction is critical, because if a\npreference for Native Hawaiians were only political and not\nracial, then § 1981, by its own terms, would not apply. No\nexemption from § 1981 would be necessary.

See, e.g., 417 U.S. at 542\n(emphasizing the BIA’s control over the “lives and destinies\nof the federally recognized Indian tribes”) (emphasis added);\nid. at 551 (“Resolution of the instant issue turns on the unique\nlegal status of Indian tribes under federal law and upon the\nplenary power of Congress, based on a history of treaties and\nthe assumption of a ‘guardian-ward’ status, to legislate on\nbehalf of federally recognized Indian tribes.”) (emphasis\nadded); id. at 553 n.24 (“The preference is not directed\ntowards a ‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’; instead, it\napplies only to members of ‘federally recognized’ tribes.”)\n(emphasis added); see also Rice, 528 U.S. at 519-20.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        19147\n   Native Hawaiians have never been accorded formal recog-\nnition as a Native American tribe,21 and while the “special\ntrust relationship” between Congress and Native Hawaiians\nbears many similarities to the relationship between Congress\nand Native American tribes, the two relationships are not\nidentical. And, as we recently acknowledged, “absent federal\nrecognition, tribes do not enjoy the same status, rights, and\nprivileges     accorded     federally     recognized     tribes.”\nKahawaiolaa v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788129\"><a href=\"/opinion/788129/patrick-l-kahawaiolaa-virgil-c-day-samuel-l-kealoha-jr-josiah-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1273 n.1 (9th Cir.\n2004). In fact, Congress has passed many statutes benefitting\nNative American tribes that do not include Native Hawaiians,\nor which distinguish them from Native American tribes. See,\ne.g., Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,\n25 U.S.C. § 450 et seq. (2000) (defining an “Indian” as “a\nperson who is a member of [a federally recognized] Indian\ntribe”); 25 U.S.C. § 3001(9), (10) (2000) (defining Native\nAmerican as “of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture that\nis indigenous to the United States” and Native Hawaiian, by\ncontrast, as “any individual who is a descendant of the aborig-\ninal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sover-\neignty in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii.”);\nsee also Kahawaiolaa, 386 F.3d at 1282 (“[F]ederal benefits\nand entitlements for native Hawaiians [are] different from\n[those] afforded federally recognized Indian tribes . . . .”); id.\n(“Congress, because of the unique history of Hawaii, has\nexcluded [Native Hawaiians] from some statutes . . . .”); id.\n(“[M]any statutes distinguish between native Hawaiians and\nmembers of Indian tribes.”).\n  21\n     There is currently legislation in Congress—part of an ongoing effort\n—to extend formal recognition to Native Hawaiians. See S. 147, 109th\nCong. (2005); H.R. 309, 109th Cong. (2005). Neither house has taken any\naction to date. Even if it were passed, however, there is cause to question\nwhether such an act would be within Congress’s constitutional power. See\nRice, 528 U.S. at 519 (“It is a matter of some dispute . . . whether Con-\ngress may treat the native Hawaiians as it does the Indian tribes.”). I\ndecline to decide this question here; thus, I will prospectively assume that\nCongress has the power to formally recognize Native Hawaiians and to\ntreat them as any other federally recognized tribe.\n\f19148               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   We cannot usurp Congress’s power to grant or not grant\nformal recognition to Native Hawaiians by simply declaring\nthat the “comparable” status of Native Hawaiians, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512(12)(D), gives them tribal status. Congress has created\na discrete process for recognizing Indian tribes as tribes. See\nIndian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 461 et seq.; see also\n25 C.F.R. § 83.1 et seq. (1994) (Department of Interior regu-\nlations). Formal recognition as a tribe comes with a bundle of\nprivileges, including self-government, tribal courts, control of\nIndian lands, and the power to tax. See, e.g., Merrion v.\nJicarilla Apache Tribe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110643\"><a href=\"/opinion/110643/merrion-v-jicarilla-apache-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982); Montana v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110436\"><a href=\"/opinion/110436/montana-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981); Santa Clara Pueblo v.\nMartinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109857\"><a href=\"/opinion/109857/santa-clara-pueblo-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978). None of these privileges have\nyet been afforded to Native Hawaiians, a judgment we\nrecently upheld in Kahawaiolaa v. Norton. As we concluded\nthere, “in the end, we must commit this question to Congress\nto apply its wisdom in deciding whether or not native Hawai-\nians should be included among those eligible to apply for fed-\neral tribal recognition.” 386 F.3d at 1283.22\n  22\n     Judge Fletcher’s concurrence cites two cases decided after Mancari\nwhich, he argues, eliminated the requirement for federal recognition:\nUnited States v. John, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109917\"><a href=\"/opinion/109917/united-states-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), and Delaware Tribal Business\nCommittee v.

See Conc. Op. at 19092-93. I\ndisagree with the characterization of these cases. The first case, John, for\nexample, did not even involve a Mancari issue but concerned whether cer-\ntain lands constituted “Indian country” for purpose of the Major Crimes\nAct. See 18 U.S.C. § 1151; see also John, 437 U.S. at 635, 647-50. More-\nover, because the tribe involved in John had been accorded federal recog-\nnition, reliance on that case to demonstrate that federal recognition is not\nnecessary for the Mancari doctrine to apply is inapposite. Id. at 650. Simi-\nlarly, Judge Fletcher’s reliance on Weeks is misplaced. In Weeks, the\nSupreme Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to Con-\ngress’s decision not to include the descendants of members of a recog-\nnized tribe who had voluntarily renounced their status in exchange for\nUnited States citizenship from a compensation scheme that benefitted the\ndescendants of tribal members who had renounced their tribal status. The\nopinion cites Mancari, but not for reasons important to the holding of\neither case. See 430 U.S. at 84, 85. Neither John nor Weeks modified Man-\ncari’s holding, either explicitly or implicitly.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                      19149\n   Finally, even if Congress had formally recognized Native\nHawaiians, Mancari’s special status doctrine would still not\nbenefit Kamehameha because that doctrine does not apply to\nprivate parties. Mancari approved a Native American hiring\npreference adopted by the BIA because of the tribes’ capacity\nas “quasi-sovereign[s].” Mancari, 417 U.S. at 554; see also\nIowa Mut. Ins. Co. v.

The “special rela-\ntionship” recognized in Mancari was a sovereign-to-sovereign\nrelationship that Congress has the power to regulate by virtue\nof the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3,\nand the Treaty Clause, id. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, which “has often\nbeen the source of the Government’s power to deal with the\nIndian tribes.” Mancari, 417 U.S. at 552; see also United\nStates v.

Kamehameha—despite the strong loyalty of Native\nHawaiians—is a private school established by a private trust,\nand not a recognized means of Native Hawaiian self-\ngovernment.\n\n  Judge Fletcher’s concurrence misses this point entirely\nwhen it asserts that “Congress may, if it wishes, permit Kame-\nhameha Schools to give preferential admission treatment to\nNative Hawaiians.” Conc. Op. at 19095.23 Judge Fletcher does\n  23\n     Judge Fletcher has it backwards. He cites the same body of laws—the\ncollection of different preferences for Native Hawaiians—as evidence that\nCongress both implicitly created a special relationship with Native Hawai-\nians and implicitly exempted them from § 1981. But Judge Fletcher’s\nanalogy to Native Americans is flawed: Congress has expressly created a\nspecial relationship with Native Americans by formally recognizing the\ntribes.\n   This makes a difference. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have held that\nNative American tribal entities are implicitly exempt from some suits\nunder § 1981. But those courts reasoned that because tribes are expressly\nexempted from disparate impact suits under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b); id. § 2000e-2, plaintiffs may not circumvent Title VII’s\nexemption by suing under § 1981. See Taylor v. Alabama Intertribal\n\f19150              DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nnot cite a single case where a court has upheld a private pref-\nerence for Native American tribal members under the special\nrelationship doctrine. In fact, we have soundly rejected\nexactly that argument. In Dawavendewa v. Salt River Project\nAgricultural Improvement and Power District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757704\"><a href=\"/opinion/757704/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1312-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45500-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 1998), pursuant to an agreement with the Navajo\nTribe, an Arizona corporation sought to discriminate in\nemployment by favoring members of the Navajo Tribe.\nDawavendewa, a member of the Hopi Tribe, filed a Title VII\nclaim alleging national origin discrimination. The defendants\nargued that, based on Mancari, “preferences based on tribal\naffiliation are based on political affiliation rather than national\norigin and are thus outside the realm of Title VII.” Id. at 1120.\nCiting “the unique interest the [BIA] had in employing Native\nAmericans,” that had led the Court to recognize a limited\nexception for Congress, we held that the plaintiff had alleged\na violation of Title VII.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1530\n(D.N.M. 1990) (“As the Supreme Court so clearly stated in\nMorton, Congress’ obligations to Indians are constitutionally\nbased and unique. The City of Albuquerque does not have\ncomparable power to treat members of federally recognized\nIndian tribes or pueblos or members of the Navajo Nation dif-\nferently than other groups of Indians or non-Indians.”); id. at\n1531 (“The Albuquerque City Council has considerably less\npower than the United States Congress to pass law discrimi-\nnating in favor of members of federally recognized Indian\ntribes and pueblos. In this respect, the rationale in Morton is\ninapplicable to this case.”); see also Rice, 528 U.S. at 520,\n522 (refusing to extend Mancari to state elections privileging\nNative Hawaiians; “the elections for OHA trustee are elec-\ntions of the State, not a separate quasi sovereign”).\n\n   Mancari may not even extend to Native American prefer-\nences in hiring by other federal agencies. The Court’s holding\nin Mancari relied on the fact that “the preference applies only\nto employment in the Indian service,” an agency that the\nCourt described as “sui generis.” 417 U.S. at 554. The Court\nspecifically did not “consider the obviously more difficult\nquestion that would be presented by a blanket exemption for\nIndians from all civil service examinations.” Id.; see also\nRice, 528 U.S. at 520 (noting “that [Mancari] was confined\nto the authority of the BIA, an agency described as ‘sui\ngeneris’ ”); Dawavendewa, 154 F.3d at 1120 (similar). We\nhave previously limited the scope of Mancari in this fashion.\nIn Williams v. Babbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741819\"><a href=\"/opinion/741819/97-cal-daily-op-serv-3982-97-daily-journal-dar-6755-thomas-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1997), for\nexample, we considered whether the Reindeer Industry Act\nlimited ownership of reindeer to Native Alaskans and whether\nsuch a limitation would be constitutional. The Act’s defenders\nattempted to justify it under the Court’s holding in Mancari.\nWe rejected this argument, holding that the power granted\nCongress under Mancari’s exception was of a far narrower\nscope. See id. at 664 (“The preference at issue in Mancari\n\f19152            DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nonly applied to the BIA, an agency created for the purpose of\nserving Indians.”); id. at 664-65 (“[W]e can discern Man-\ncari’s scope by looking to the cases it cited as examples of\npermissible special treatment for Indians. Each case dealt with\nlife in the immediate vicinity of Indian land.” (citations omit-\nted)); id. at 655 (“While Mancari is not necessarily limited to\nstatutes that give special treatment to Indians on Indian land,\nwe do read it as shielding only those statutes that affect\nuniquely Indian interests.”); id. (“[W]e seriously doubt that\nCongress could give Indians a complete monopoly on the\ncasino industry or on Space Shuttle contracts.”).\n\n   In sum, Mancari does not support Judge Fletcher’s claim\nthat Kamehameha’s admissions policy is justified because it\nis both a racial and political classification. Judge Fletcher’s\nrationale would render Mancari unrecognizable. Indeed, as\nwith the exclusive Native Hawaiian voting scheme rejected by\nthe Supreme Court in Rice, if Kamehameha’s racially exclu-\nsive admissions policy “were to be sustained under Mancari\nwe would be required to accept some beginning premises not\nyet established in our case law . . . . These propositions would\nraise questions of considerable moment and difficulty.” 528\nU.S. at 518.\n\n                    IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n   As noble as Kamehameha’s goals may be, I cannot recon-\ncile its admissions preference—a racially exclusive policy\nthat operates as a complete bar to all applicants who are not\nof the preferred race—with the Supreme Court’s requirements\nfor a valid affirmative action plan. I cannot reconcile Kame-\nhameha’s admissions policy with the plain commands of\n§ 1981, nor can I find any evidence whatsoever that Congress\nexempted Kamehameha from § 1981 altogether. The majority\nexempts an organization with noble goals that seeks to rem-\nedy a significant problem in a community that is in great\nneed, but it can do so only because the majority departs from\nclear principles and established precedent.\n\f                   DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19153\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nRYMER, Circuit Judge, with whom KOZINSKI,\nO’SCANNLAIN, TALLMAN and CALLAHAN, Circuit\nJudges, join, dissenting:\n\n  This is altogether infelicitous.\n\n   On the one hand, the Kamehameha Schools is a well-\nrecognized, widely- acclaimed private school, established\nbefore Hawaii became a state, whose primary mission has\nbeen to educate Native Hawaiian students in a culturally sen-\nsitive, challenging way. It receives no federal funds and does\nnot operate for profit. Its purpose of providing meaningful\naccess to educational opportunity is intuitively salutary. On\nthe other hand, the admissions policy of the Kamehameha\nSchools prefers students of Native Hawaiian ancestry in such\na way that, as a practical matter, non-Native Hawaiian stu-\ndents are precluded.\n\n   The question is whether Kamehameha’s admissions policy\nviolates 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Section 1981 was originally\nenacted as part of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and confers on\n“[a]ll persons . . . the same right in every State . . . to make\nand enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .”\n\n   We do not write on a clean slate, otherwise I would ques-\ntion how a statute that accords to all persons the same right\nto contract as is enjoyed by white citizens can mean the same\nright to contract as is enjoyed by Native Hawaiians.

Thus, the articulated justification for its race-based\nadmissions policy is to remedy external discrimination, not\ninternal imbalance. Even if a private educational enterprise\nhas more wiggle room in defining its core mission in a race-\nconscious way than a private employer, to legitimate a race-\nbased policy solely on account of discrimination by others is\nto put no bounds on it at all. To do so would render meaning-\nless the factors that influenced the Supreme Court in Weber\nto approve a voluntary, private, affirmative action plan. 443\nU.S. at 208-09. A private entity’s progress toward achieving\n“balance” cannot realistically be assessed if measured against\nsociety as a whole rather than its own work force or its own\nstudent body. But, even if a private party should be able to\nassume a public responsibility for remediation of past societal\ndiscrimination, the acceptable goal of a race-conscious admis-\nsions policy for a public educational institution is to achieve\na diverse student body. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 325 (endorsing\nthe view that student body diversity is a compelling state\ninterest that can justify the use of race in public university\nadmissions). The purpose of Kamehameha Schools and its\nadmissions policy is, of course, just the opposite. That, in a\nnutshell, is why I feel bound to reverse.\n\n  Beyond this, I agree with Judge Bybee that Congressional\napplause for programs that benefit Native Hawaiians neither\nconnotes approval of an exclusionary admissions policy based\n\f19156                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\non racial preference, nor grafts an exception onto § 1981. I\nalso agree that Morton v. Mancari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), does\nnot save the Kamehameha policy. Mancari involved a federal\nemployment preference for persons of tribal ancestry that the\nCourt upheld against a Fifth Amendment challenge because\ntribes, which are federally-recognized, are a political, rather\nthan a racial, classification. 417 U.S. at 553-55. However, the\nCourt has since declined to extend Mancari to an Hawaii stat-\nutory scheme that restricted voting for certain state officials\nto those of Native Hawaiian ancestry. Rice, 528 U.S. at 518-\n23.\n\n   As no other basis appears for affirming, I would reverse.\n\n\n\nKLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges KOZINSKI\nand O’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:\n\n  I agree in large part with Judge Bybee’s dissent and join in\nParts II and III. His analysis of the majority and concurring\nopinions is in my view correct.\n\n   I write separately because I do not agree with Judge\nBybee’s view that Title VII provides the standard of review\nin this case. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment.1\nThis case does not involve employment. Title VII has nothing\n  1\n    See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment prac-\ntice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\nvidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because\nof such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (2) to\nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment\nin any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.”).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                     19157\nto do with exclusion of students from schools because of race.\nNor is there a need to mine Title VII for some sort of analogy.2\n\n   The recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions about affirmative\naction, Grutter3 and Gratz,4 also have nothing to do with this\ncase. Those cases involved whether racial discrimination by\npublic schools under affirmative action plans violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This\ncase does not involve a public school or state action, so Grut-\nter, Gratz, and the Equal Protection Clause do not come into\nthe analysis.\n\n   We are not free to treat Hawaiian ancestry as a political\nrather than racial designation under Morton v. Mancari5\nbecause the Supreme Court held in Rice v. Cayetano that\nHawaiian ancestry is a “racial classification.”6 If Congress\nchooses to define persons of Native Hawaiian ancestry as\nIndians under 25 U.S.C. § 479 or some other provision, per-\nhaps it can.7 But it has not.\n\n   This case is considerably simpler. In practice, Kameha-\nmeha Schools excludes students who do not have Native\nHawaiian ancestry. The Kamehameha Schools are admirable\nin many ways, and there are good historical and social reasons\nwhy reasonable people might want to follow just such a pol-\nicy. But we are not free to make a social judgment about what\nis best for Hawaiians. We are stuck with a case that is before\nus in our capacity as judges and we have to follow the law.\n  2\n     Patterson v.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   The law we have to follow was laid down by the Supreme\nCourt in Runyon v. McCrary.8 Runyon holds that the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, prohibits a private\nschool from denying admission to prospective students\nbecause of their race.9 It might have been thought that Runyon\nprohibited discrimination only against black people, but we\nare not free to interpret it that way. In McDonald v. Santa Fe\nTrail Transportation, the Supreme Court decided that the stat-\nute construed in Runyon, 42 U.S.C. §1981, protects whites as\nwell as non-whites from discrimination.10 A fortiori it protects\nall the ethnic groups in Hawaii: blacks, Filipino-Americans,\nJapanese-Americans,         American      Samoans,     Chinese-\nAmericans, and all the others, regardless of their ancestry.\n\n  In my view, that is the end of the analysis. I might have\npreferred to avoid deciding this case, if some jurisdictional\ndefect existed. But we do have jurisdiction.

The provision is implicated here\nbecause the schools charge tuition and must therefore enter\ninto a contractual relationship with each student. I don’t\nbelieve section 1981 would apply at all if the schools were\nrun entirely as a philanthropic enterprise and allowed students\nto attend for free. In Runyon, “the racial exclusion practiced\nby the [schools] amount[ed] to a classic violation of § 1981,”\nbecause “[t]he parents . . . sought to enter into contractual\nrelationships with [the schools] for educational services.” 427\nU.S. at 172. The Court emphasized the commercial nature of\nthe relationship: “Under those contractual relationships, the\nschools would have received payments for services rendered,\nand the prospective students would have received instruction\nin return for those payments.” Id. I have found no case where\nsection 1981 has been applied to a charity. Were the schools\nto forego charging tuition, their relationship to their students\nwould probably not be deemed “contractual” as that term is\nused in section 1981 and Runyon.\n\n   Being able to charge tuition is, of course, not inconsequen-\ntial. For most private schools it is a make-or-break proposi-\ntion. But it may not be so for the Kamehameha Schools,\nwhich were set up primarily as eleemosynary institutions. The\ntuition they charge reflects only a small fraction of their oper-\nating costs and, even then, most students pay a reduced\ntuition, or no tuition at all. See maj. op. at 19057-58. The\nschools’ substantial endowment may enable them to continue\noperating without charging any tuition for a very long time—\nperhaps indefinitely.\n\n   Given the scores of pages we have written on both sides of\nthis issue, it should be clear that the question is close and ours\nmay not be the last word. Given the passions this case has\naroused, see maj. op. at 19064 n.6, it’s worth noting that\nwhat’s really at stake may not be the operation of the Kame-\n\f19160           DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nhameha Schools along their traditional (preferential) model,\nbut merely a few million dollars a year the schools now get\nfrom their own students.\n\f</pre>",
