Stat. § (Rule) 809.61.\n\n       ¶2         This     appeal    originates         from    a    collision     at    an\n\nintersection in the City of Racine between the plaintiff's car\n\nand a Racine police car driven by Officer Matsen, the defendant.\n\nThe police car was responding to an emergency dispatch calling\n\nthe officer to the scene of an accident.\n\n       ¶3         The collision of the automobiles presents an issue of\n\nlaw at the juncture of Wis. Stat. § 893.80 (2011-12),3 governing\n\nthe    immunity          of    municipal   government          and   its   officers     and\n\nemployees, and Wis. Stat. § 346.03, governing the rules of the\n\nroad for emergency vehicles.\n\n       ¶4         The immunity statute, Wis. Stat. § 893.80(4), declares\n\nthat no suit may be brought against any governmental actor for\n\nacts       done    in    the   exercise    of       legislative,     quasi-legislative,\n\njudicial,         or     quasi-judicial    functions.           \"These     functions    are\n\nsynonymous with discretionary acts.\"4                      The law of our state is\n\n\n       1\n       The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and\nFarmers Insurance Exchange are involuntary plaintiffs.

Stat.\n\n§ 346.03(5).\n\n       ¶6      The       appeal   raises       two      issues        of    law.          The     more\n\ndifficult       one       implicates        the       interplay       between          Wis.      Stat.\n\n§§ 893.80(4) and 346.03(5).                  The appeal raises the question of\n\nhow     to     reconcile       the     statutory         dichotomy          of        discretionary\n\nimmunity       and       ministerial      liability           in   § 893.80(4)            with     the\n\nstatutory       imposition        of    a    duty       on     officers          to    operate      an\n\nauthorized          emergency        vehicle          \"with     due        regard        under     the\n\ncircumstances for the safety of all persons\" in § 346.03(5).\n\n\n\n\n     \"When analyzing and applying Wis. Stat. § 893.80(4), we\noften have used the term 'discretionary' as a shorthand to refer\nto decisions of a governmental entity that are legislative,\nquasi-legislative,   judicial    or   quasi-judicial.\"   Showers\nAppraisals, LLC v.

Stat. § 346.03(2)(b)\n    (2011-12), if the officer slowed the vehicle and\n    activated lights and sirens as required by § 346.03(3)\n    but nonetheless arguably violated the duty to operate\n    the vehicle \"with due regard under the circumstances\"\n    as       required      by       § 346.03(5)? . . . More\n    specifically, . . . when, if ever, the \"due regard\"\n    requirement    imposed  by    § 346.03(5)   becomes   a\n    \"ministerial\" obligation, violation of which will\n    create an exception to governmental immunity.6\n    ¶8   The second issue of law is whether, assuming liability\n\nfor the police officer's alleged negligence, there was credible\n\n\n\n\n    6\n       The court of appeals' certification memorandum viewed the\nfollowing question as left open by Brown v. Acuity, 2013 WI 60,\n¶42, 348 Wis. 2d 603, 833 N.W.2d 96:\n\n    [D]oes immunity apply if an officer's manner          of\n    proceeding against a traffic signal fulfills         the\n    ministerial duties of Wis. Stat. § 346.03(2)(b)      and\n    (3) (that is, the officer slows the vehicle          and\n    activates lights and sirens) but arguably violates   the\n    duty to operate the vehicle \"with due regard under   the\n    circumstances\" as required by § 346.03(5)?\n\n     The City of Racine and Amy L. Matsen raised the issue of\ntheir governmental immunity by a post-verdict motion seeking\njudgment    notwithstanding   the    verdict.       Wis.   Stat.\n§ 805.14(5)(b).    A circuit court's order granting a judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict is a ruling on an issue of law. The\ncircuit court in effect granted the motion by dismissing the\naction on the ground of governmental immunity.\n\n                               4\n\f                                                                      No.   2012AP2499\n\n\n\nevidence to support the jury's verdict that the police officer's\n\nnegligence caused the plaintiff's injuries.7\n\n     ¶9     The    first    issue     requires        that     we   interpret      the\n\nimmunity statute and the rules of the road statute and apply\n\nthem to the facts presented.\n\n     ¶10    The plaintiff asserts that the immunity statute does\n\nnot apply to the alleged negligent acts of the police officer in\n\nfailing to keep a proper lookout and failing to maintain a speed\n\nthat allowed for a proper lookout.                In contrast, the defendant\n\nasserts that the police officer's decisions regarding lookout\n\nand speed, which the plaintiff alleges are part of the duty of\n\n\"due regard under the circumstances,\" are instead part of the\n\nofficer's    discretionary      decision         to    enter    the     intersection\n\nagainst the red light.         In sum, the officer contends that her\n\ndecisions    regarding      lookout    and       speed,      when     she   proceeded\n\nthrough the red light after slowing down with the squad car's\n\nlights     and    siren    engaged    in     compliance        with     Wis.    Stat.\n\n§ 346.03(2)(b) and (3), were immune discretionary acts.\n     ¶11    Both parties rely on Estate of Cavanaugh v. Andrade,\n\n202 Wis. 2d 290, 319, 550 N.W.2d 103 (1996), to support their\n\nrespective positions.\n\n     ¶12    The    plaintiff   relies       on   the    following       sentence   in\n\nCavanaugh:\n\n\n\n     7\n       The City of Racine and Amy L. Matsen challenged the jury\nverdict by a motion for directed verdict. The circuit court in\neffect granted the motion.\n\n                                        5\n\f                                                                    No.   2012AP2499\n\n\n      In sum, despite the general discretionary act immunity\n      set forth in § 893.80(4), a negligence action may be\n      sustained against an officer involved in a high-speed\n      pursuit on the grounds that he or she breached the\n      duty to operate the vehicle with \"due regard under the\n      circumstances\" under § 346.03(5).\nCavanaugh, 202 Wis. 2d at 319.\n\n      ¶13   The   defendant   relies       on   the   very   next    sentence    in\n\nCavanaugh:\n\n      However, the negligent operation under § 346.03(5)\n      does not include the discretionary decisions to\n      initiate or continue a pursuit; such discretionary\n      decisions continue to be afforded immunity under\n      § 893.80(4).\nId.\n\n      ¶14   In its certification memorandum, the court of appeals\n\npointed out that Cavanaugh instructs that \"an officer can be\n\nliable for negligent driving during an emergency response if\n\ndamages were caused by the officer's negligent operation of the\n\nvehicle     beyond   the   context     of       the   discretionary       decision\n\nitself.\"     Yet this leaves us to puzzle:             Which decisions go to\n\nnegligent operation, and which go to the discretionary decision?\n      ¶15   The court of appeals explains this gray area left by\n\nCavanaugh as follows:\n\n      When, if ever, does a public officer's obligation to\n      operate an emergency vehicle with \"due regard under\n      the circumstances\" under Wis. Stat. § 346.03(5) create\n      an exception to the governmental immunity provided by\n      Wis. Stat. § 893.80?\n\n      When, if ever, does a public officer's decision to\n      violate rules of the road during an emergency trigger\n      potential liability for arguable failure to operate\n      with \"due regard under the circumstances\" by making\n      that decision?\n\n\n                                       6\n\f                                                                           No.    2012AP2499\n\n\n\n       ¶16    We conclude that the immunity statute does not apply\n\nin the present case to the police officer's violation of the\n\nduty    to     operate      the     vehicle        \"with     due    regard       under    the\n\ncircumstances.\"           A contrary outcome would contravene Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 893.80(4) and 346.03(5), public policy, the rules of statutory\n\ninterpretation, and case law.\n\n       ¶17    We further conclude that there was credible evidence\n\nto support the jury verdict of causal negligence on the part of\n\nthe police officer.\n\n       ¶18    For the reasons set forth, we reverse the judgment of\n\nthe circuit court dismissing the action and remand the matter to\n\nthe circuit court to reinstate the jury verdict.\n\n       ¶19    We reach this conclusion by reasoning as follows:\n\n        I.    We    state    the     facts     and     procedural      posture      of     the\n\n              appeal.\n\n        II.

She engaged in a full emergency\n\nresponse, activating her lights and siren in the squad car and\nexceeded the speed limit.\n\n         ¶23   At    around   noon,        she       was   proceeding        northbound       on\n\nDouglas Avenue in the City of Racine at a high rate of speed,\n\noccasionally using the car's bullhorn.\n\n         ¶24   As she approached the intersection of Douglas Avenue\n\nand South Street, she observed the red light and slowed her car\n\nto 27 miles per hour.              The posted speed limit was 30 miles per\n\nhour.      Northbound traffic was stopped at the light.                         The officer\nmaneuvered her car around the traffic stopped at the light and\n                                                 8\n\f                                                                              No.       2012AP2499\n\n\n\ninto    the    southbound         lanes       of       Douglas    Avenue     to     enter      the\n\nintersection.\n\n       ¶25    Before impact, the officer saw another vehicle turn\n\nfrom the eastbound lane of South Street onto the southbound lane\n\nof   Douglas       Avenue.        The     officer        testified     that       she    had    to\n\nmaneuver her car to avoid the turning car.\n\n       ¶26    When the officer's car entered the intersection, the\n\nplaintiff's car was eastbound on South Street at 30 miles per\n\nhour.    Eastbound traffic, including the plaintiff, had a green\n\nlight.       The plaintiff did not slow down when she entered the\n\nintersection.            The     plaintiff's           radio    was   on;    the    car's      air\n\nconditioning        was    on;    and     the      car    windows     were    closed.          The\n\nplaintiff         did    not     see    the     officer's         vehicle     or    hear       the\n\nofficer's siren or horn.\n\n       ¶27    A    KFC    store        sits   on       the     southwest     corner      of    the\n\nintersection.            Both parties stipulated that the store blocked\n\nthe view of cars entering the intersection.                           The plaintiff's car\n\nwould not have been visible to the officer and the officer's car\nwould not have been visible to the plaintiff until about two\n\nseconds before the collision occurred.\n\n       ¶28    When        both     cars       entered           the   intersection,            the\n\nplaintiff's vehicle struck the driver's side of the officer's\n\nvehicle.      The collision was recorded by a dash-mounted camera in\n\nthe squad car.\n\n       ¶29    Both the plaintiff and the officer were injured.                                 The\n\nplaintiff brought suit against the police officer and the City\nof Racine for injuries sustained.\n                                                   9\n\f                                                                   No.    2012AP2499\n\n\n\n    ¶30    At     trial,   the    police       officer    conceded       that     she\n\nconsidered   it    necessary     to    check     for   pedestrians       and    other\n\nvehicles and travel at a reasonable speed to make observations\n\nabout traffic, in order to properly exercise her duty of care.\n\n    ¶31    Additionally,       the     parties    stipulated   that       City     of\n\nRacine    Police    Department        Policy     and   Procedure     Number       812\n\ndictates the requirements of an officer in responding to an\n\nemergency request.     The policy reads in relevant part:\n\n    POLICY:\n\n    The operator of an emergency vehicle shall insure that\n    he or she has due regard for the safety of all\n    occupants of his or her vehicle as well as the safety\n    of pedestrians and occupants of other vehicles.\n\n    PROCEDURE:\n\n    When responding to an emergency call or actively\n    involved in a pursuit, the following requirements must\n    be complied with:\n\n           1. Use emergency lights and siren simultaneously\n           and continuously.\n\n           2.

Keep in mind that the exemptions granted above\ndo not relieve department members from the duty\nto drive with due regard under the circumstances\nfor the safety of all persons, taking into\nconsideration:\n\n    a. The type, actions        and   speed    of   the\n    vehicle being pursued;\n\n    b. The geographic area of pursuit and its\n    population density;\n\n    c.

Their value for decision-\n            making purposes is enhanced when considered in\n            combination.\n      ¶32   The    jury   returned        a     special      verdict,      finding    that,\n\ninter   alia:      (1)    the      defendant         was    causally      negligent     with\n\nregard to the operation of her motor vehicle; (2) the plaintiff\n\nwas causally negligent with regard to the operation of her motor\n\nvehicle; and (3) the defendant and the plaintiff were each fifty\n\npercent causally negligent.                   The jury awarded damages to the\n\nplaintiff in the amount of $129,799.72.                          The police officer did\nnot seek damages in the present case.\n\n      ¶33   After the verdict was returned, the officer brought a\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict asserting the\n\nofficer's      immunity      and     a    motion           for    a     directed    verdict\n\nchallenging, inter alia, the jury's finding of the defendant's\n\ncausal negligence.\n\n      ¶34   On     the    motion         for        judgment       notwithstanding       the\n\nverdict, the circuit court ruled as a matter of law that because\n\nthe   police     officer's      decision        to    enter       the   intersection     was\n\ndiscretionary, all her other allegedly negligent decisions were\npart of her discretionary decision and immune from suit.                             On the\n\nmotion for a directed verdict, the circuit court ruled that the\n\npolice officer had a duty to exercise due regard but that in the\n\ninstant case the police officer's negligence was not causal.\n\n                                               II\n\n      ¶35   The instant case requires us to survey the current\n\nstate of the doctrine of governmental immunity governed by Wis.\nStat. § 893.80 to give context for our decision.\n\n                                               12\n\f                                                                    No.   2012AP2499\n\n\n\n     ¶36     Prior to 1961, the common law doctrine of governmental\n\nimmunity    generally   barred    tort      suits   against     a    governmental\n\nentity.      In Holytz v. City of Milwaukee, 17 Wis. 2d 26, 115\n\nN.W.2d 618    (1962),   the    court   rejected      the     immunity       doctrine\n\noutright      for    municipalities         and     stated     a      new      rule:\n\n\"[H]enceforward, so far as governmental responsibility for torts\n\nis concerned, the rule is liability——the exception is immunity.\"\n\nHolytz, 17 Wis. 2d at 39.        Nevertheless, Holytz declared that a\n\nmunicipality is not liable for acts done \"in the exercise of its\n\nlegislative or judicial or quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial\n\nfunctions.\"     Holytz, 17 Wis. 2d at 40.\n\n     ¶37     The Holytz court noted that if the legislature deemed\n\nit better public policy, the legislature was of course free to\n\nreinstate immunity.\n\n     ¶38     After   Holytz,   the     legislature      created       Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 331.43, now numbered § 893.80, setting forth the circumstances\n\nunder which the general rule of governmental liability does not\n\napply.8     The statute codified Holytz's exception to municipal\ngovernmental liability:        Government is immune for acts done in\n\nthe exercise of \"legislative, judicial, quasi-legislative, and\n\nquasi-judicial functions.\"9\n\n     8\n         Ch. 198, Laws of 1963.\n     9\n       See Milwaukee Metro.

Stat. § 346.03(5) is to be interpreted as\n\nimposing liability on a governmental actor is supported by the\n\ntext of Wis.

As our\n\ncase law has demonstrated, although not consistently, a duty\nneed not dictate each precise undertaking that the government\n\nactor must implement in order to be ministerial.53\n\n       ¶132 In Cavanaugh, for example, the statute established a\n\nduty on the part of the governmental entity to create guidelines\n\nbut did not explain the exact method or means by which to enact\n\nthose guidelines, i.e., it left them to the discretion of the\n\n\n\n       53\n            See ¶¶48-59, supra.\n\n                                            47\n\f                                                                 No.   2012AP2499\n\n\n\nentity.54    Nevertheless, in Cavanaugh, the court held that when\n\nthe governmental entity fails to comply with the requirements of\n\nWis.

Stat. § 346.03(6).\n     55\n       As Downs v. United States, 522 F.2d 990 (6th Cir. 1975)\nnotes, in interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act, operating an\nautomobile is the archetypal nondiscretionary act, even though\nit still involves judgment on the part of the operator:\n\n     It is not the mere exercise of judgment, however,\n     which immunizes the United States from liability for\n     the torts of its employees. Driving an automobile was\n     frequently cited in the congressional reports leading\n     to the Act as an example of \"non-discretionary\"\n     activity which would be outside the discretionary\n     function exception. Driving an automobile involves\n     judgment. The failure to signal a turn, for example,\n     may be said to represent an exercise of judgment,\n     albeit a poor one.      Yet, the automobile accident\n     caused by a federal employee while on the job is an\n     archetypal claim which Congress sought to place in the\n     courts.\n\nDowns, 522 F.2d at 995 (citations omitted).

For example the area through which the\n\nemergency responder passes and the time of day are part of the\n\ncircumstances of an emergency response, e.g., is the emergency\n\nresponder    proceeding        through    a     school    district      with       children\n\npresent or is he or she proceeding through a rural area at two\n\no'clock in the morning?           The type of emergency is also part of\nthe circumstances, e.g., is the call for help a request for help\n\nfor a feared heart attack or a call to stop a vehicle involved\n\nin a traffic violation?\n\n      ¶157 \"Due regard under the circumstances for the safety of\n\nall   persons\"   is    not     fully     described       with   particularity,          nor\n\ncould it be, because the circumstances will generally require\n\nthe exercise of judgment by the emergency responder in ways that\n\nare   particular     to   the    circumstance       with       which    the       emergency\nresponder is confronted.

This section requires law enforcement agencies\n\nto provide written guidelines for officers to assist in their\n\nresponse to an emergency.              Those guidelines are to consider,\n\n\"road conditions, density of population, severity of crime and\n\nnecessity of pursuit by vehicle.\"                § 346.03(6).\n\n       ¶159 Of    course,     we     expect      emergency       responders          to    use\n\ndiscretion under the circumstances to permit them to respond\n\nsafely and promptly.              Of course, we contemplate that they may\n\nnot follow the rules of the road when so responding.                                 In the\n\nmind of the responder and in the legislature's own language, the\n\nresponse will be balanced and measured in that the responder\n\nmust use \"due regard under the circumstances.\"                          This balancing\n\ngenerally    requires       judgment    calls         that     vary    circumstance         by\n\ncircumstance.      Such a balancing of continuingly changing factors\nin an emergency response             then       is not \"absolute, certain and\n\nimperative\" decision-making as the legislature would have set\n\nout if a ministerial duty were fully described.\n\n       ¶160 To explain further, under our precedent, discretionary\n\nand ministerial duties are very different.                           Ministerial duties\n\nare     \"'absolute,        certain     and       imperative,'           involving          the\n\n'performance      of   a    specific    task'         that     the    law     imposes      and\n\ndefines the 'time, mode and occasion for its performance with\nsuch     certainty         that     nothing          remains     for         judgment       or\n\n                                            5\n\f                                                                  No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\ndiscretion.'\"          Brown    v.

Brown,\n\n348 Wis. 2d 603, ¶41 (quoting Wis. Stat. § 893.80(4)).                            Acts\n\nthat require the exercise of judgment are \"discretionary\" under\n\nthe law.   Lister, 72 Wis. 2d 282.             A public officer discharging\n\na \"ministerial duty,\" by contrast, is not entitled to immunity.\n\nKimps v. Hill, 200 Wis. 2d 1, 10, 546 N.W.2d 151 (1996).5\n\n     ¶162 As    this    court   has     consistently        stated,      \"[a]   public\n\nofficer's duty is ministerial only when it is 'absolute, certain\n\nand imperative,' involving the 'performance of a specific task'\n\nthat the law imposes and defines the 'time, mode and occasion\n\nfor its performance with such certainty that nothing remains for\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       While the majority opinion criticizes the distinction\nbetween \"discretionary\" acts, and \"ministerial\" duties, see\nmajority op. ¶¶48-56, it nonetheless remains the law in\nWisconsin.

The    majority     fails   to     address     how\n\nOfficer Matsen's duty of due regard under the circumstances was\n\n\"'absolute, certain and imperative,'\" such that she needed to\n\nperform    only    a   \"'a    specific      task'\"     in   order      to   meet    her\n\nobligation.       Id. (quoting Lister, 72 Wis. 2d at 301).                  Further,\n\nthe   majority     does    not    explain      how   Officer   Matsen's      duty   to\n\nexercise \"due regard under the circumstances\" in the case at\n\nissue imposed or defined the \"'time, mode and occasion'\" for the\n\nperformance of any such task \"'with such certainty that nothing\n\nremains for judgment or discretion.'\"                  Id. (quoting Lister, 72\n\nWis. 2d at 301).          Instead, the majority opinion concludes that\n\nan emergency responder is under a ministerial duty not to be\n\ninvolved in an accident.             See majority op., ¶¶142-43.               If an\n\naccident   occurs,        under   the   majority's      standard,       immunity    is\n\nseemingly precluded.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n       The majority opinion claims that some cases, specifically\nWillow Creek Ranch, L.L.C. v. Town of Shelby, 2000 WI 56, 235\nWis. 2d 409, 611 N.W.2d 693, have used a less stringent\nstatement of the ministerial duty standard.    See majority op.,\n¶49. This assertion, however, is incorrect. See Willow Creek,\n235 Wis. 2d 409, ¶27 (stating that \"[a] ministerial act, in\ncontrast to an immune discretionary act, involves a duty that\n'is absolute, certain and imperative, involving merely the\nperformance of a specific task when the law imposes, prescribes\nand defines the time, mode and occasion for its performance with\nsuch   certainty   that   nothing   remains  for   judgment   or\ndiscretion'\").\n\n                                           7\n\f                                                                  No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n       ¶164 Additionally,         the     majority      opinion's       analysis     is\n\ninconsistent        with   this    court's     prior    decision    in     Estate    of\n\nCavanaugh v. Andrade, 202 Wis. 2d 290, 550 N.W.2d 103 (1996).\n\nIn Cavanaugh we concluded that Wis. Stat. \"§ 346.03(5) does not\n\npreclude the defense of immunity for the discretionary acts of\n\ninitiating or continuing a high-speed pursuit.\"                    Id. at 317.       In\n\nso doing, we distinguished between a discretionary decision to\n\npursue a suspect, and a ministerial obligation to \"physically\n\noperate\" a vehicle with \"due regard under the circumstances for\n\nthe safety of all persons.\"             Id. at 316-17.       We also pointed out\n\nthat a determination that the officer was negligent did not\n\npreclude      the   conclusion     that   he    or    she   had   acted    with    \"due\n\nregard      under   the    circumstances\"      and     thereby    was    immune    from\n\nliability.       Id. at 319.7\n\n       ¶165 In      Cavanaugh     the   officer      initiated    and    continued    a\n\nhigh speed pursuit through a residential neighborhood.                         Id. at\n\n296.       The pursuit proceeded through solid red traffic signals at\n\nbetween 60 and 80 miles per hour, despite the fact that the\nsuspect's illegal conduct merely involved a moving violation.\n\nId.    We nonetheless concluded that the officer was entitled to\n\nimmunity, because the decision to engage in such a pursuit was\n\ndiscretionary and not ministerial.                Id. at 316.       We noted that\n\n\"[i]nherent in the decision to pursue is the decision to speed.\"\n\n       7\n       In Estate of Cavanaugh v. Andrade, 202 Wis. 2d 290, 550\nN.W.2d 103 (1996), the jury found that the officer failed to\nmaintain a proper lookout and this failure was causal in regard\nto Cavanaugh's injuries.   Id. at 319.  In the case before us,\nOfficer Matsen was found by the jury to have failed to maintain\na proper lookout.\n\n                                           8\n\f                                                                   No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\nId.   The court applied the \"due regard under the circumstances\"\n\nstandard and stated that \"an officer may be negligent pursuant\n\nto [Wis. Stat.] § 346.03(5) for failing to physically operate\n\nhis or her vehicle with due regard for the safety of others.\"\n\nId. at 317.      The court, however, concluded that the officer's\n\nrunning of red lights, at 60 to 80 mile per hour, did not\n\nviolate the \"due regard under the circumstances\" standard, and\n\nconcluded that the officer was immune from liability.\n\n      ¶166 It    is    difficult      to     reconcile       the     precedent        of\n\nCavanaugh with the majority opinion today.                    As in Cavanaugh,\n\nOfficer     Matsen    was   operating       her    vehicle    in         an   emergency\n\nresponse.     In Cavanaugh, the officer ran several red lights at\n\nbetween 60 and 80 miles per hour.                 By contrast, Officer Matsen\n\nentered an intersection against a red traffic signal, but did so\n\nat only 27 miles per hour.         In Cavanaugh, the officer was acting\n\nin an effort to issue a traffic ticket.                In the case at issue,\n\nOfficer Matsen was responding to an emergency dispatch calling\n\nher to the scene of an accident.\n      ¶167 As   with    Cavanaugh     and     that    officer's           decision   to\n\npursue, Officer Matsen exercised her judgment in deciding to\n\nproceed through the intersection, in response to an emergency.\n\nAs with Cavanaugh, inherent in Officer Matsen's judgment is the\n\nexercise of discretion in deciding whether to proceed through\n\nthe intersection with its risk of danger from cross-traffic.                          As\n\nwith Cavanaugh, Officer Matsen did not maintain proper lookout.\n\n      ¶168 Stated differently, the case at issue is controlled by\nCavanaugh.      If    the   officer   in    Cavanaugh    was       immune      for   his\n\n                                        9\n\f                                                                No.   2012AP2499.akz\n\n\ndiscretionary decision to run red lights at 60 to 80 miles per\n\nhour in order to chase a traffic offender, Officer Matsen also\n\nis    immune    for     her    discretionary        decision     to     enter    an\n\nintersection against a red signal at 27 miles per hour in order\n\nto respond to an emergency dispatch calling her to the scene of\n\nan accident.\n\n      ¶169 The majority opinion dutifully recites the standard\n\narticulated in        Cavanaugh     but does not apply it, and instead\n\nopines that Cavanaugh is merely \"instructive.\"                    Majority op.,\n\n¶¶100-16.        The     majority       neither     overrules     nor     reverses\n\nCavanaugh, but it seriously undermines its value as precedent.8\n\n      ¶170 Under the majority's analysis, I am concerned whether\n\na plaintiff who is involved in an automobile accident with an\n\nemergency responder need plead only that the responder failed to\n\nexercise \"due regard\" in order to automatically defeat a claim\n\nof immunity.      Such a principle is clearly at odds with one of\n\nthe   primary    justifications       for     governmental     immunity:    \"[t]he\n\ndanger    of   influencing     public    officers    in   the    performance     of\ntheir     functions     by    the   threat     of   lawsuit.\"         Kimps,    200\n\nWis. 2d 1, 9.     It is also at odds with the plain meaning of Wis.\n\nStat. § 346.03.\n\n      ¶171 For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n      8\n       The only real difference between the two cases is that, in\nthe case at issue, the officer himself was involved in the\naccident, while in Cavanaugh it was the suspect who struck\nanother vehicle.    This difference aptly illustrates how the\nmajority's holding really works: officers are now under a\nministerial duty not to be involved in traffic accidents.\n\n                                         10\n\f                                                      No.     2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n    ¶172 I   am   authorized   to   state   that   Justices     ANN   WALSH\n\nBRADLEY and PATIENCE DRAKE ROGGENSACK join this dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                    11\n\f    No.   2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n\n\n1\n\f",

In contrast, the defendant\n\nasserts that the police officer's decisions regarding lookout\n\nand speed, which the plaintiff alleges are part of the duty of\n\n\"due regard under the circumstances,\" are instead part of the\n\nofficer's    discretionary      decision         to    enter    the     intersection\n\nagainst the red light.

(3) relative to the\n    giving of audible and visual signals.\n\n    (5) The exemptions granted the operator of an\n    authorized emergency vehicle by this section do not\n    relieve such operator from the duty to drive or ride\n    with due regard under the circumstances for the safety\n    of all persons nor do they protect such operator from\n    the consequences of his or her reckless disregard for\n    the safety of others.\n\n    (5m) The privileges granted under this section apply\n    to the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle\n    under s. 340.01(3)(dg) or (dh) only if the operator\n    has successfully completed a safety and training\n    course in emergency vehicle operation that is taken at\n    a technical college under ch. 38 or that is approved\n    by the department and only if the vehicle being\n    operated is plainly marked, in a manner prescribed by\n    the department, to identify it as an authorized\n    emergency vehicle under s. 340.01(3)(dg) or (dh).\n\n    (6) Every law enforcement agency that uses authorized\n    emergency vehicles shall provide written guidelines\n    for its officers and employees regarding exceeding\n    speed limits under the circumstances specified in sub.\n    (4) and when otherwise in pursuit of actual or\n    suspected violators.    The guidelines shall consider,\n    among other factors, road conditions, density of\n    population, severity of crime and necessity of pursuit\n    by vehicle.     The guidelines are not subject to\n    requirements for rules under ch. 227.        Each law\n    enforcement agency shall review its written guidelines\n    by June 30 of each even-numbered year and, if\n    considered appropriate by the law enforcement agency,\n    shall revise those guidelines.\n    ¶67   In   contrast   to   the   other   subsections'   exemption    of\nemergency vehicle operators from compliance with certain rules\n\n\n                                     27\n\f                                                                   No.   2012AP2499\n\n\n\nof the road, subsection (5) of Wis. Stat. § 346.03 imposes a\n\nduty    on   an     operator   of   an    authorized        emergency    vehicle.\n\nSubsection (5) states that the exemptions from the rules of the\n\nroad granted an operator of an authorized emergency vehicle \"do\n\nnot relieve the operator from the duty to drive or ride with due\n\nregard under the circumstances for the safety of all persons and\n\ndo not protect the operator from the consequences of his or her\n\nreckless disregard for the safety of others.\"\n\n       ¶68   Thus,    § 346.03(5), as         the   court     of   appeals     has\n\nexplained, \"qualifies the privileges granted by secs. 346.03(1)\n\nto (4).\"37     Subsection (5) does not, however, explicitly impose\n\nliability on a governmental actor.\n\n       ¶69   That Wis. Stat. § 346.03(5) is to be interpreted as\n\nimposing liability on a governmental actor is supported by the\n\ntext of Wis. Stat. § 346.03(5) imposing a duty of due regard, in\n\nthe context of the exemption/privilege language of the other\n\nprovisions of § 346.03.        This language leads us to conclude that\n\nan exemption or privilege begets immunity and a duty begets\nliability.

The\n\ndecision to proceed, the officer reasons, was a discretionary\n\nact and thus her lookout and speed were subject to immunity akin\n\nto   the    decision        to    engage      and      persist   in    pursuit      in   the\n\nCavanaugh case.\n\n      ¶98     In    contrast,          the   plaintiff     argues      that   the   police\n\nofficer's negligence, such as the officer's failure to keep a\nlookout, goes to the \"physical operation of the vehicle.\"\n                                                37\n\f                                                                               No.    2012AP2499\n\n\n\n       ¶99    We first examine Cavanaugh more closely to distill its\n\nteachings.

Stat. § 346.03(3).                    As she approached the\n\nintersection, Officer Matsen slowed her vehicle to 27 miles per\n\nhour,   below    the   30    miles   per       hour   posted   speed   limit,    thus\n\ncomplying with § 346.03(2)(b).              While it is true that Legue and\n\nOfficer Matsen were not visible to one another because a KFC\n\nblocked their view of each other, Officer Matsen had engaged\nfull emergency response with her squad lights on and emergency\n\nsiren sounding.\n\n    ¶153 Legue was under an absolute obligation to give Officer\n\nMatsen the right of way.           See Wis.

Legue\n\nentered the intersection traveling at 30 miles per hour and\n\nbroadsided Officer Matsen's squad car.                       The jury found Legue and\n\nOfficer Matsen equally negligent.                         The circuit court, however,\n\nconcluded that Officer Matsen, as an emergency responder, was\n\nentitled      to    immunity       as    she       was    acting      in    a     discretionary\n\ncapacity with due regard under the circumstances.                               I agree.\n\n    ¶154 The         majority       opinion        fails    to     interpret          Wis.    Stat.\n\n§ 346.03(5) and concludes that Officer Matsen, as an emergency\n\nresponder,     is    not     entitled         to    immunity       because        she    was   not\n\nacting with discretionary authority, but instead failed in her\n\n\"ministerial         duty\"     to       act        with     \"due      regard          under    the\n\ncircumstances.\"            Majority       op.,      ¶¶131-33.          In       so    doing,    the\n\nmajority opinion ignores the plain meaning of                                   § 346.03(5) by\n\naffording      virtually       no       consideration            to    the        legislature's\n\ncoupling of \"due regard\" with \"under the circumstances.\"                                        The\n\nmajority opinion confuses discretionary decision-making that the\nlegislature        afforded    to       emergency         responders       with       common    law\n\nnegligence principles.\n\n    ¶155 I conclude that Wis. Stat. § 346.03 sets the test we\n\nare to apply.          The statute illuminates what is meant by \"due\n\nregard\"     when      an     authorized            emergency          vehicle         enters     an\n\nintersection against a red light.                        It provides that an operator\n\nof an emergency vehicle can proceed past a red light if it\n\n         Upon the approach of any authorized emergency\n    vehicle giving audible signal by siren the operator of\n    a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way . . . .\n\n                                               3\n\f                                                                     No.     2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n\"slow[s] down as may be necessary for safe operation\" and if it\n\ngives   a   \"visual    signal     by     means    of     at   least    one        flashing,\n\noscillating or rotating red light except that the visual signal\n\ngiven by a police vehicle may be by means of a blue light and a\n\nred light which are flashing, oscillating or rotating, . . . and\n\nalso an audible signal by means of a siren or exhaust whistle.\"\n\nWis. Stat. § 346.03(2)(b) and (3).                     These requirements inform\n\nwhat regard is due.\n\n      ¶156 Although       the     case     at     issue       involved       an    officer\n\ntraveling    below     the     speed     limit    with    her       lights     and   siren\n\nengaged,    entering      an   intersection        against      a    red     signal,   the\n\ncircumstances that can attend responding to an emergency are\n\nincredibly diverse.            For example the area through which the\n\nemergency responder passes and the time of day are part of the\n\ncircumstances of an emergency response, e.g., is the emergency\n\nresponder    proceeding        through    a     school    district      with       children\n\npresent or is he or she proceeding through a rural area at two\n\no'clock in the morning?           The type of emergency is also part of\nthe circumstances, e.g., is the call for help a request for help\n\nfor a feared heart attack or a call to stop a vehicle involved\n\nin a traffic violation?\n\n      ¶157 \"Due regard under the circumstances for the safety of\n\nall   persons\"   is    not     fully     described       with   particularity,          nor\n\ncould it be, because the circumstances will generally require\n\nthe exercise of judgment by the emergency responder in ways that\n\nare   particular     to   the    circumstance       with       which    the       emergency\nresponder is confronted.           When the circumstances                  require such\n\n                                           4\n\f                                                                       No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\nan     exercise   of    judgment,      it       is     the     sine    qua     non    of     a\n\ndiscretionary decision.\n\n       ¶158 Wisconsin Stat. § 346.03(6) also shows that exercising\n\n\"due    regard    under      the    circumstances\"           often     will     require      a\n\njudgment call.         This section requires law enforcement agencies\n\nto provide written guidelines for officers to assist in their\n\nresponse to an emergency.              Those guidelines are to consider,\n\n\"road conditions, density of population, severity of crime and\n\nnecessity of pursuit by vehicle.\"                § 346.03(6).\n\n       ¶159 Of    course,     we     expect      emergency       responders          to    use\n\ndiscretion under the circumstances to permit them to respond\n\nsafely and promptly.              Of course, we contemplate that they may\n\nnot follow the rules of the road when so responding.                                 In the\n\nmind of the responder and in the legislature's own language, the\n\nresponse will be balanced and measured in that the responder\n\nmust use \"due regard under the circumstances.\"                          This balancing\n\ngenerally    requires       judgment    calls         that     vary    circumstance         by\n\ncircumstance.      Such a balancing of continuingly changing factors\nin an emergency response             then       is not \"absolute, certain and\n\nimperative\" decision-making as the legislature would have set\n\nout if a ministerial duty were fully described.\n\n       ¶160 To explain further, under our precedent, discretionary\n\nand ministerial duties are very different.                           Ministerial duties\n\nare     \"'absolute,        certain     and       imperative,'           involving          the\n\n'performance      of   a    specific    task'         that     the    law     imposes      and\n\ndefines the 'time, mode and occasion for its performance with\nsuch     certainty         that     nothing          remains     for         judgment       or\n\n                                            5\n\f                                                                  No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\ndiscretion.'\"          Brown    v.

Id. at 319.  In the case before us,\nOfficer Matsen was found by the jury to have failed to maintain\na proper lookout.\n\n                                           8\n\f                                                                   No.    2012AP2499.akz\n\n\nId.   The court applied the \"due regard under the circumstances\"\n\nstandard and stated that \"an officer may be negligent pursuant\n\nto [Wis. Stat.] § 346.03(5) for failing to physically operate\n\nhis or her vehicle with due regard for the safety of others.\"\n\nId. at 317.      The court, however, concluded that the officer's\n\nrunning of red lights, at 60 to 80 mile per hour, did not\n\nviolate the \"due regard under the circumstances\" standard, and\n\nconcluded that the officer was immune from liability.\n\n      ¶166 It    is    difficult      to     reconcile       the     precedent        of\n\nCavanaugh with the majority opinion today.                    As in Cavanaugh,\n\nOfficer     Matsen    was   operating       her    vehicle    in         an   emergency\n\nresponse.     In Cavanaugh, the officer ran several red lights at\n\nbetween 60 and 80 miles per hour.                 By contrast, Officer Matsen\n\nentered an intersection against a red traffic signal, but did so\n\nat only 27 miles per hour.         In Cavanaugh, the officer was acting\n\nin an effort to issue a traffic ticket.                In the case at issue,\n\nOfficer Matsen was responding to an emergency dispatch calling\n\nher to the scene of an accident.\n      ¶167 As   with    Cavanaugh     and     that    officer's           decision   to\n\npursue, Officer Matsen exercised her judgment in deciding to\n\nproceed through the intersection, in response to an emergency.\n\nAs with Cavanaugh, inherent in Officer Matsen's judgment is the\n\nexercise of discretion in deciding whether to proceed through\n\nthe intersection with its risk of danger from cross-traffic.                          As\n\nwith Cavanaugh, Officer Matsen did not maintain proper lookout.\n\n      ¶168 Stated differently, the case at issue is controlled by\nCavanaugh.      If    the   officer   in    Cavanaugh    was       immune      for   his\n\n                                        9\n\f                                                                No.   2012AP2499.akz\n\n\ndiscretionary decision to run red lights at 60 to 80 miles per\n\nhour in order to chase a traffic offender, Officer Matsen also\n\nis    immune    for     her    discretionary        decision     to     enter    an\n\nintersection against a red signal at 27 miles per hour in order\n\nto respond to an emergency dispatch calling her to the scene of\n\nan accident.\n\n      ¶169 The majority opinion dutifully recites the standard\n\narticulated in        Cavanaugh     but does not apply it, and instead\n\nopines that Cavanaugh is merely \"instructive.\"                    Majority op.,\n\n¶¶100-16.        The     majority       neither     overrules     nor     reverses\n\nCavanaugh, but it seriously undermines its value as precedent.8\n\n      ¶170 Under the majority's analysis, I am concerned whether\n\na plaintiff who is involved in an automobile accident with an\n\nemergency responder need plead only that the responder failed to\n\nexercise \"due regard\" in order to automatically defeat a claim\n\nof immunity.      Such a principle is clearly at odds with one of\n\nthe   primary    justifications       for     governmental     immunity:    \"[t]he\n\ndanger    of   influencing     public    officers    in   the    performance     of\ntheir     functions     by    the   threat     of   lawsuit.\"         Kimps,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067654/kimps-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9.     It is also at odds with the plain meaning of Wis.\n\nStat. § 346.03.\n\n      ¶171 For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n      8\n       The only real difference between the two cases is that, in\nthe case at issue, the officer himself was involved in the\naccident, while in Cavanaugh it was the suspect who struck\nanother vehicle.    This difference aptly illustrates how the\nmajority's holding really works: officers are now under a\nministerial duty not to be involved in traffic accidents.\n\n                                         10\n\f                                                      No.     2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n    ¶172 I   am   authorized   to   state   that   Justices     ANN   WALSH\n\nBRADLEY and PATIENCE DRAKE ROGGENSACK join this dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                    11\n\f    No.   2012AP2499.akz\n\n\n\n\n1\n\f</pre>",
