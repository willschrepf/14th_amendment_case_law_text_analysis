Despite the  parents' protests, a state\n\nhearing   officer   declared  the   school   committee's  1991-92\n\nindividualized  education  program  (IEP)  appropriate   for  the\n\nchild's needs and  in compliance  with federal law.   The  United\n\nStates  District  Court  for the  District  of  Maine upheld  the\n\nfinding.  We affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Daniel Lenn, a minor, is handicapped within the meaning\n\nof  the Individuals  with Disabilities  Education Act  (IDEA), 20\n\nU.S.C.     1400-1485  (1988 &amp;  Supp.  III 1991).1   Daniel  has a\n\nsevere, non-verbal learning disability connected with the brain's\n\nright hemisphere.  While his verbal IQ test scores are average to\n\nlow  average,  Daniel   has  difficulty  interpreting  non-verbal\n\nmessages, such  as facial cues.   He has a short  attention span,\n\nlacks  the ability to intake, process, or retrieve information in\n\nan  organized   way,   possesses  poor   visual   memory,   often\n\nmisperceives the  world around him, and  pays excessive attention\n\nto  small details.   His  disability inhibits  social interaction\n\nwith peers and impedes academic progress.\n\n          Daniel attended the Portland, Maine public schools as a\n\n                    \n\n     1In their complaint, the  plaintiffs also invoke section 504\nof  the Rehabilitation Act, 29  U.S.C.   794  (1988).  Concluding\nthat the sweep  of the two statutes is identical  for purposes of\nthis  case,  the parties  have  briefed and  argued  their points\nsolely with  reference to the IDEA.   We assume arguendo that the\n                                                        \nparties'  assessment is accurate.  Hence, we analyze the assigned\nerrors under the IDEA.\n\n                                2\n\nspecial  education student  through the eighth  grade.   While he\n\nadvanced from year to year,  his attainments fell steadily behind\n\nthose of  his peers.  His  progress slowed to a  crawl during the\n\n1989-90  and  1990-91 school  years.   By  July 1991,  Daniel had\n\ncompleted  the  eighth  grade;  nevertheless,  his  reading   and\n\nmathematical calculation  scores were  at  roughly a  sixth-grade\n\nlevel  and his score in applied mathematics was at a second-grade\n\nlevel.\n\n          Daniel's eighth-grade year (1990-91) was interrupted by\n\na  one-month  midwinter  hospital  stay,  during  which  treating\n\nprofessionals illuminated the nature  and extent of his cognitive\n\ndisability.  That July,  Daniel's parents placed him in  a summer\n\nprogram at Eagle Hill,  a private school in Massachusetts.   They\n\nalso contacted the Cleveland Clinic  and arranged to have  Daniel\n\nundergo  a series  of additional  educational, neurological,  and\n\npsychological  examinations.     Relying  in  part   on  the  new\n\ninformation generated through  the Lenns'  efforts, the  Portland\n\nSchool  Committee (Portland) shifted  gears, scrapped  several of\n\nits earlier  (unsuccessful) approaches,  and proposed an  IEP for\n\nDaniel's   ninth-grade   education    that   contained    several\n\ninnovations.  Nevertheless, Daniel's parents rejected the public-\n\nschool-based program, unilaterally enrolled Daniel as a full-time\n\nresidential  student at Eagle  Hill,2 and requested  a hearing on\n\nthe IEP's adequacy.\n\n                    \n\n     2Daniel is  still  in residence  at  Eagle Hill,  albeit  at\nconsiderable expense to the Lenns.\n\n                                3\n\n          After pondering testimony  from eighteen witnesses  and\n\nreviewing numerous exhibits, the  state hearing officer concluded\n\nthat  Portland's IEP for the 1991-92  school year was \"reasonably\n\ncalculated  to  be  of  significant  educational  benefit  in  an\n\nenvironment  which is  much  less restrictive  than Eagle  Hill.\"\n\nAccordingly, he  rejected the  Lenns' remonstrance.   The federal\n\ndistrict  court upheld  the  agency determination.   This  appeal\n\nensued.3\n\nII.  STATUTORY OVERVIEW\n\n          We  start  our substantive  discussion  by  parsing the\n\nstatutory scheme and describing how,  and to what extent, parents\n\nor guardians displeased by a school board's response to a child's\n\nhandicap may seek judicial review of an IEP.\n\n                                A\n\n          To qualify  for federal funding under the IDEA, a state\n\nmust  offer  \"all  children  with  disabilities  .  .  .  a  free\n\nappropriate public  education.\"   20 U.S.C.     1400(c), 1412(1).\n\nIn this context, appropriateness requires that  the instructional\n\nplan  be  custom  tailored  to address  the  handicapped  child's\n\n\"unique  needs,\"  20  U.S.C.    1400(c),  in  a  way  \"reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the  child to receive educational benefits.\"\n\nBoard of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S.  176, 207 (1982); accord Amann\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3Daniel  Lenn  and his  parents,  Stephen  and Eileen  Lenn,\nplaintiffs below, are appellants in this court.  Portland and the\nMaine  Department  of  Education,  defendants  below,  appear  as\nappellees.   In  view of  the community  of interest  between the\nschool  committee and the state agency, we treat the appeal as if\nPortland were the sole appellee.\n\n                                4\n\nv.  Stow Sch. Sys., 982 F.2d 644,  647 (1st Cir. 1992); Roland M.\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983,  987 (1st Cir. 1990), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 111  S. Ct.  1122 (1991).   Because the  IEP    a written\n      \n\ndocument  detailing the student's  current educational level, the\n\nshort-term  and  long-term goals  of  the  educational plan,  the\n\nspecific  services to be offered (including transition services),\n\nand a set of objective criteria for subsequent evaluation, see 20\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   1401(20);  34 C.F.R.    300.346 (1992)    comprises  the\n\ncenterpiece of a state's  IDEA-compelled response to a particular\n\nchild's handicap, the critical inquiry in a case of this genre is\n\n\"whether  a  proposed  IEP  is adequate  and  appropriate  for  a\n\nparticular  child at  a  given point  in  time.\"   Burlington  v.\n                                                             \n\nDepartment  of Educ., 736 F.2d  773, 788 (1st  Cir. 1984), aff'd,\n                                                                \n\n471 U.S. 359 (1985).\n\n          The  IDEA does  not  promise perfect  solutions to  the\n\nvexing problems  posed by the existence  of learning disabilities\n\nin children and adolescents.  The Act sets more modest goals:  it\n\nemphasizes an  appropriate, rather  than an ideal,  education; it\n\nrequires   an   adequate,   rather   than   an   optimal,    IEP.\n\nAppropriateness and adequacy are terms of moderation.  It follows\n\nthat, although an IEP must afford some educational benefit to the\n\nhandicapped  child,  the benefit  conferred  need  not reach  the\n\nhighest attainable level or even the level needed to maximize the\n\nchild's  potential.  See Rowley, 458 U.S.  at 198; Roland M., 910\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 992.\n\n          The   IDEA   also   articulates   a    preference   for\n\n                                5\n\nmainstreaming.   See 20  U.S.C.    1412(5)  (requiring states  to\n                    \n\neducate handicapped and non-handicapped children together \"to the\n\nmaximum   extent  appropriate\").     Translated   into  practical\n\napplication, this preference signifies  that a student \"who would\n\nmake educational progress in a day  program\" is not entitled to a\n\nresidential  placement  even if  the  latter  \"would more  nearly\n\nenable the child to reach his or her full potential.\"  Abrahamson\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Hershman, 701 F.2d 223,  227 (1st Cir.  1983); accord Hampton\n                                                                 \n\nSch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976 F.2d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 1992).  And,\n                         \n\nmoreover, when the bias  in favor of mainstreaming is  married to\n\nthe concepts of appropriateness and adequacy, it becomes apparent\n\nthat  an IEP  which places  a  pupil in  a regular  public school\n\nprogram will ordinarily  pass academic  muster as long  as it  is\n\n\"reasonably  calculated to  enable the  child to  achieve passing\n\nmarks and advance from grade to grade.\"  Rowley, 458 U.S. at 204.\n                                               \n\n                                B\n\n          A parent or guardian may challenge an IEP's adequacy by\n\ndemanding  a due  process  hearing before  the state  educational\n\nagency.   See 20 U.S.C.     1415(b)(2),  1415(c).  If  the agency\n             \n\napproves  the IEP, the parent or guardian may seek further review\n\nin either state or federal court.  See id.  at   1415(e)(2).  The\n                                          \n\nrelevant statutory provision requires the forum court to mull the\n\nadministrative record,  take  additional evidence  under  certain\n\ncircumstances, and  \"base[] its decision on  the preponderance of\n\nthe  evidence.\"  Id.   While the IDEA  envisions judicial review,\n                    \n\nthe  statute \"is  by  no means  an  invitation to  the  courts to\n\n                                6\n\nsubstitute  their own  notions  of sound  educational policy  for\n\nthose  of the school authorities which they review.\"  Rowley, 458\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  206.    Rather,  the law  contemplates  an  intermediate\n\nstandard of review on  the trial-court level   a  standard which,\n\nbecause it is characterized by independence of judgment, requires\n\na more critical appraisal of the agency determination than clear-\n\nerror review  entails, but which, nevertheless,  falls well short\n\nof complete  de novo review.   See  Roland M., 910  F.2d at  989;\n                                             \n\nColin K. v. Schmidt, 715 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1983).\n                   \n\n          In  the  course   of  this   independent  review,   the\n\nadministrative   proceedings  must  be   accorded  \"due  weight.\"\n\nRowley,  458 U.S.  at 206;  see  also Colin  K., 715  F.2d at  5.\n                                               \n\nAlthough the exact quantum  of weight is subject to  the district\n\njudge's exercise of informed discretion, see Hampton, 976 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n52;  G.D. v.

In the end, the\n\njudicial function at  the trial-court level  is \"one of  involved\n\noversight,\" Roland M., 910 F.2d at 989; and in the course of that\n                     \n\noversight,  the  persuasiveness  of a  particular  administrative\n\nfinding, or the lack thereof, is likely to tell the tale.\n\n                                C\n\n                                7\n\n          Determining the adequacy of  an IEP is a fact-intensive\n\nexercise.   Consistent with  this verity, the  governing standard\n\nfor appellate review in an IDEA case is firmly settled:\n\n          [I]n  the absence  of a  mistake of  law, the\n          court  of appeals  should  accept a  district\n          court's   resolution   of   questions   anent\n          adequacy  and  appropriateness of  an  IEP so\n          long  as  the  court's  conclusions  are  not\n          clearly erroneous on the record as a whole.\n\nId. at 990-91.  The clear-error hurdle is, of course, quite high.\n   \n\nSee, e.g., Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148,\n                                                  \n\n152  (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that, under a regime of clear-error\n\nreview, an appellate court  \"ought not to upset findings  of fact\n\nor  conclusions  drawn  therefrom unless,  on  the  whole of  the\n\nrecord, [the  appellate judges] form a  strong, unyielding belief\n\nthat a  mistake has  been made\").   Even  in precincts  where the\n\nclearly erroneous  standard  obtains, however,  a  trial  court's\n\nrulings of  law are  reviewed de  novo.   See  LeBlanc v.

CLAIMED ERRORS OF LAW\n\n          In an  effort to  sidestep clear-error review  and take\n\nshelter  in the lee of  a more accommodating  standard, the Lenns\n\nattribute two  errors of law  to the  court below.   They contend\n\nthat  the court (1) applied  the wrong legal  yardstick in taking\n\nthe  measure of  the hearing officer's  findings; and  (2) failed\n\nsufficiently to address each  of Daniel's identified  educational\n\nneeds in determining the adequacy of Portland's proposed IEP.  We\n\ndiscuss these contentions seriatim.\n                                  \n\n                                8\n\n                                A\n\n          Appellants'  flagship claim  is  that  the lower  court\n\naffirmed the hearing  officer's decision  without conducting  the\n\nindependent evidentiary review that the IDEA requires.  The claim\n\nfounders:   the  record  below contains  all  the earmarks  of  a\n\nsuitably deferential, yet suitably independent, judicial inquiry.\n\n          The linchpin of this conclusion is the district court's\n\nopinion.  In it,  Judge Brody explains a reviewing  court's duty,\n\ncanvasses  the   pertinent  authorities,  and   acknowledges  the\n\nrelationship  between  the  hearing  officer's findings  and  the\n\ndistrict court's oversight function, concluding that  \"while [the\n\ndistrict]  court must  make an  independent ruling,  [its] review\n\nmust  be something  short of  de novo.\"   Lenn  v.  Portland Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nComm., No.  92-0011-P-H, slip op. at 6 (D. Me. Dec. 14, 1992) (D.\n     \n\nCt. Op.).  The court's discussion could hardly be more pointed or\n\nmore accurate.\n\n          In  the face of this pellucid prose, appellants have an\n\nuphill battle.  They argue that, although the district judge gave\n\nlip  service  to the  correct  standard, he  actually  viewed the\n\nevidence through  a much  more deferential  glass.   We recognize\n\nthat  actions sometimes speak louder  than words.   Thus, a trial\n\ncourt  cannot satisfy its oversight obligation in an IDEA case by\n\nreciting the catechism of independent review and  then failing to\n\npractice  what it  preaches.   But when,  as now,  a  trial court\n\ndelineates the proper  rule of decision,  citing book and  verse,\n\nthe burden  of demonstrating  that the court  is merely  mouthing\n\n                                9\n\nempty platitudes rests with the party who mounts the  accusation.\n\nThis  is  a  heavy burden;  it  cannot  be  carried by  perfervid\n\nrhetoric  or glib wordplay.   To  prevail on  such a  theory, the\n\naccuser  must offer solid indications  that the district court in\n\nfact  strayed  from  the straight  and  narrow.    After all,  an\n\nappellate tribunal  ought not lightly assume that a federal trial\n\njudge  is  indulging in  the adjudicatory  equivalent of  a shell\n\ngame.\n\n          In  this instance,  we  think the  accusation that  the\n\njudge said one  thing, but did another, is unfounded.  The Lenns'\n\nmost touted point  is their asseveration that  the district court\n\nexpressly  invoked the clear-error standard when  it noted that a\n\ncourt  is \"not confined to the hearing officer's decision if [it]\n\nfind[s] clear error.\"  D. Ct. Op. at 10.  Based primarily on this\n\nremark,4 appellants invite us  to disregard the court's professed\n\nallegiance to the  correct standard  of review.   We decline  the\n\ninvitation.\n\n          First and foremost, we simply cannot credit appellants'\n\nargument  that  this  isolated  reference  indicates  a wholesale\n\n                    \n\n     4The district court also wrote that it found \"ample evidence\nin the record\" to support the hearing officer's decision.  D. Ct.\nOp. at 10.   Appellants  argue that this  statement manifests  an\nabandonment  of  the  preponderance-of-the-evidence test.    This\nargument  proves  nothing  more  than  appellants'  penchant  for\ngrasping  at straws    especially since  the context  makes clear\nthat the lower court applied the proper test; indeed, in the very\nsame  paragraph  of  its  opinion,  the  court  used  the  phrase\n\"preponderance  of the evidence.\"   Id.  We  will neither confine\n                                       \ndistrict courts to the rote recitation of buzzwords  nor penalize\nthem   for  relieving  the  tedium  of  opinion  writing  by  the\noccasional employment of artful synonyms.\n\n                                10\n\nabandonment of the principles of independent review.  We think it\n\nis  far more likely, all things considered, that the reference to\n\n\"clear error\" represents simply an infelicitous choice of phrase.\n\nIndeed, a close perusal of the record makes manifest the depth of\n\njudicial  involvement and  provides  clinching evidence  that the\n\ndistrict  judge  utilized  the approved  level  of  review.   The\n\ntranscript reveals that the judge took a hands-on approach to the\n\ndecisional process.  Instead of limiting his perscrutation to the\n\nadministrative  record, he  conducted  what amounted  to a  mini-\n\ntrial, hearing testimony  from two  witnesses regarding  Daniel's\n\neducational  needs  and  receiving  newly  emergent documentation\n\nchronicling  Daniel's progress  at  Eagle Hill.   The  judge then\n\ncarefully scrutinized all the evidence, new and old, and drew his\n\nown conclusions  from  it.   This is  the very  stuff from  which\n\nindependent review is fashioned.\n\n          We have said enough.  The law does not require district\n\ncourts to be precise to the point of pedantry.   Consequently, an\n\nappellate court must  not hesitate to excuse  an awkward locution\n\nand give  a busy trial judge  a bit of breathing room.   If using\n\nthe  wrong word  or phrase  constituted grounds  for reversal  in\n\nevery  case, much  too high  a premium  would be placed  on sheer\n\nliteralism.   We have  regularly refused  to exact that  premium.\n\nSee,  e.g., Roland M., 910 F.2d at 991 n.4 (disregarding district\n                     \n\ncourt's \"infelicitous\" choice of terminology  where \"the context,\n\nand other statements in  the court's memorandum\" made  plain that\n\nthe  court  fully  understood  the  operative  legal  principle);\n\n                                11\n\nCollins v.

So here.   Mindful that pettifoggery, for its own sake,\n\nbenefits  no one,  we  will not  disregard  the totality  of  the\n\ncircumstances  in  a  headlong  rush to  elevate  formalism  over\n\nsubstance.\n\n          We add,  moreover, that  even if Judge  Brody used  the\n\nchallenged  terminology  in a  purposeful  manner,  we would  not\n\nreverse.  The \"clear  error\" reference appears in a  paragraph in\n\nwhich, after restating the hearing  officer's key findings   that\n\nthe 1991-92 IEP  offered Daniel  a major change  in services  and\n\nthat   the  new  mix  was   reasonably  calculated  to  bestow  a\n\nsignificant educational  benefit on him    the judge acknowledged\n\nhis  duty to afford the administrative proceeding due weight.5  A\n\n                    \n\n     5The court wrote:  \"While we are not confined to the hearing\nofficer's  decision if we find clear error, we are constrained in\nthat we cannot  impose our view of preferable educational methods\n\n                                12\n\nreference at this  juncture to clear  error is not  inappropriate\n\nsince the precise  degree of deference attributable  to a hearing\n\nofficer's subsidiary findings of fact in an IDEA  case ultimately\n                    \n\nrests  within the trial court's  discretion.  See, e.g., Hampton,\n                                                                \n\n976  F.2d at 52; Westmoreland,  930 F.2d at  946; Burlington, 736\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  792.    That  the  district  court  may  have  afforded\n\nparticular  administrative  findings substantial  respect    even\n\ndeference  on a  par with  clearly erroneous  review    would not\n\ncomprise  reversible  error   so  long  as  the   court  made  an\n\nindependent  ruling   as  to  the  IEP's  adequacy   based  on  a\n\npreponderance   of  all  the   evidence,  including  the  hearing\n\nofficer's duly weighted findings.\n\n          This  criterion was satisfied.   The opinion as a whole\n\nshows   conclusively   that   the  judge   made   an  independent\n\ndetermination concerning the adequacy of Portland's IEP, throwing\n\nall the available  evidence into  the pot.   Among other  things,\n\nJudge  Brody  specifically discussed  the  testimony  of Daniel's\n\nteachers  in Portland,  the testimony  of the  Cleveland Clinic's\n\nindependent  evaluators, and  Daniel's standardized  test scores.\n\nD. Ct.  Op. at 11.  He also cited additional record evidence that\n\nbuttressed  the  hearing  officer's evaluation  of  Daniel's past\n\nprogress in  the Portland  public schools  and the likelihood  of\n\nfuture   educational  benefits   should   the   1991-92  IEP   be\n\nimplemented.  Id.  at 10.  Last, but surely  not least, the judge\n                 \n\napplied the proper burden of proof, concluding that the Lenns had\n\n                    \n\nupon the state.\"  D. Ct. Op. at 10.\n\n                                13\n\nnot \"proven [theircase] by a preponderance ofthe evidence.\"  Id.6\n                                                                \n\n          It strains credulity to assume, in these circumstances,\n\nthat  the  district court's  lonely  reference  to \"clear  error\"\n\nheralds an intention to disregard a standard of review explicitly\n\ndescribed  in the court's  opinion and indelibly  etched upon its\n\npages.   Hence, we find no warping of the standard of review.  We\n\nhasten to add,  however, that  even if  the controversial  phrase\n\nrepresents  more than  a slip  of the  district court's  pen    a\n\nsupposition  that we  deem  unsubstantiated    the reference,  by\n\nitself,  does   not  call   into  question  the   court's  proper\n\nperformance of its oversight function.\n\n                                B\n\n          Appellants next  assert that  the  district court  must\n\n\"determine  separately for  each area  of  identified educational\n\nneed . . . whether, by  a preponderance of the evidence, [an IEP]\n\naddresses that  need\" sufficiently.   Appellants' Reply  Brief at\n\n11.   Building on this premise, appellants then conclude that the\n\ncourt below  emasculated the  requirement by failing  to consider\n\n                    \n\n     6While the Lenns grudgingly acknowledge this reference, they\nmaintain that the  court erred  by requiring them  to prove  that\nonly Eagle Hill will provide Daniel with an appropriate education\n    \nwhen,   in  fact,   their   burden  was   merely  to   prove  the\ninappropriateness of  Portland's  IEP.   On  balance, we  do  not\nbelieve it can fairly  be said that the court  misapprehended the\ncontours  of  the issue.    Throughout  its pages,  the  district\ncourt's  opinion  is  geared   toward  determining  whether  \"the\nproposed  IEP  was  reasonably  calculated to  enable  Daniel  to\nreceive educational benefits.\"   D. Ct. Op. at  10.  Indeed,  the\ncourt pointedly wrote that \"[a]lthough the Eagle Hill residential\nprogram may well be the ideal educational environment for Daniel,\nthat is not the legal standard under [the] IDEA.\"  Id.   \n                                                      \nThis specific  disclaimer sounds the death  knell for appellants'\nargument.\n\n                                14\n\n\"separately\"  and \"directly\"  whether  Portland's  IEP  addressed\n\nDaniel's non-academic needs in a meaningfully beneficial way.  We\n\ndisagree with both the premise and the conclusion.\n\n          Admittedly, an IEP is  designed as a package.   It must\n\ntarget  \"all of a child's special needs,\" Burlington, 736 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n788  (emphasis  supplied), whether  they  be academic,  physical,\n\nemotional, or social.  See Roland M., 910 F.2d at 992 (explaining\n                                    \n\nthat \"purely academic  progress . . . is not  the only indici[um]\n\nof  educational benefit\");  Timothy  W. v.  Rochester, N.H.  Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nDist., 875  F.2d 954, 970 (1st Cir.)  (observing that \"education\"\n     \n\nunder the Act  is broadly  defined), cert. denied,  493 U.S.  983\n                                                 \n\n(1989); U.S. Dep't of  Educ., Notice of Policy Guidance,  57 Fed.\n\nReg.  49,274 at 49,275 (1992)  (stating that an  IEP must address\n\n\"the  full  range  of  the  child's  needs\").    Because  a  one-\n\ndimensional view of an  IEP would afford too narrow  a foundation\n\nfor a determination that the program  is reasonably calculated to\n\nprovide \"effective results\" and \"demonstrable improvement\" in the\n\nvarious  \"educational and personal  skills identified  as special\n\nneeds,\"  Burlington,   736  F.2d  at  788,   a  district  court's\n                   \n\ndetermination  that  an IEP  complies  with  the Act  necessarily\n\ninvolves a host of subsidiary determinations. \n\n          Be  that  as  it  may,  appellants'  legal  formulation\n\ndistorts the Act's requirements.   The Act does not  mandate, nor\n\nhas any court held  it to require, that  the district judge  must\n\nconsider  each  unique  need in  isolation  and  make a  separate\n\nfinding regarding the  preponderance of the evidence in  each and\n\n                                15\n\nevery  identified area.  Such a requirement would serve merely to\n\nbalkanize the  concept of educational  benefit and to  burden the\n\ndistrict courts without producing  any offsetting advantages.  We\n\nhold that no such requirement exists.  In the last analysis, what\n\nmatters  is  not whether  the district  judge  makes a  series of\n\nsegregable findings,  but whether the  judge is cognizant  of all\n\nthe  child's special needs and considers the IEP's offerings as a\n\nunitary whole, taking those special needs into proper account.\n\n          The   record   also  belies   appellants'  self-serving\n\nsuggestion  that  the district  court assessed  Daniel's academic\n\nneeds in  a vacuum.    A trial court charged  with evaluating the\n\nadequacy of an  IEP cannot be said to  have committed legal error\n\nas long as (1)  it does not overlook  or misconstrue evidence  of\n\nrecord,  and (2) its overall decision is based upon a supportable\n\nfinding  that the  program  described in  the  IEP is  reasonably\n\ncalculated to address  the handicapped child's  education-related\n\nneeds,  both academic  and  non-academic.   The district  court's\n\nfinding in this  case fits  comfortably within that  rubric.   We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n          The  district  court explicitly  acknowledged \"Daniel's\n\nself-esteem and social skills  needs\" and took pains to  limn the\n\n\"wide  range  of  after-school   support  services\"  proposed  by\n\nPortland  to  address those  needs.    D.  Ct.  Op.  at  8.    In\n\nconsidering  the  likely  impact  of these  services,  the  court\n\nfocused on Portland's plan to provide a social skills facilitator\n\nand opined that, although  hiring a facilitator might not  be the\n\n                                16\n\nbest mechanism for addressing Daniel's needs, \"the ideal\" is  not\n\n\"the legal standard under [the]  IDEA.\"  Id. at 10; see  also id.\n                                                                 \n\nat  12.  The court observed that Portland's program would \"enable\n\nDaniel  to remain in his  home community and  interact daily with\n\nnon-disabled  peers,\"  id.  at  10, thus  furthering  his  social\n                          \n\ndevelopment.7    Finally, the  judge  mentioned  that while  \"the\n\ngoals for  Daniel's social  and organizational skill  development\n\nwould  be more useful if they could be objectively measured,\" id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 11 n.2, this deficiency does not undermine the IEP.\n\n          Based on these, and other comments, it is clear  beyond\n\nhope of contradiction that Portland's ability to address Daniel's\n\nnon-academic   needs  informed   the  district   court's  overall\n\ndetermination that the IEP  comports with the Act's requirements.\n\nNo more is exigible.\n\nIV.  WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Appellants' final  assignment of error posits  that the\n\ndistrict court blundered in  concluding that Portland's IEP would\n\n                    \n\n     7We do not accept appellants' hypothesis that the mainstream\nnature of a proposed  placement can never enter into  the primary\nanalysis  of an  IEP's  adequacy.   When  a child,  like  Daniel,\ndemonstrates a particular need for  learning how to interact with\nnon-disabled peers, a mainstream placement will almost inevitably\nhelp to  address that need.   Such an  integral aspect of  an IEP\npackage  cannot be  ignored  when judging  the program's  overall\nadequacy and appropriateness.   The Third Circuit, which recently\nreaffirmed the  special nature  of the educational  benefits that\nmainstream  programs confer,  apparently shares  this view.   See\n                                                                 \nOberti v. Board of Educ.,     F.2d    ,     (3d  Cir. 1993) [1993\n                        \nWL  178480, *9]  (observing  that, in  assessing the  educational\nbenefit  of placing  a  handicapped  child  with  non-handicapped\npeers,  \"the  court must  pay special  attention to  those unique\nbenefits  the child  may  obtain from  integration  in a  regular\nclassroom  .   .  .,   i.e.,  the  development   of  social   and\n                           \ncommunication skills from interaction with nondisabled peers\").\n\n                                17\n\nprovide Daniel with an appropriate public education.  We  discern\n\nno clear error.   To  the contrary, the  record fully sustains  a\n\nfinding that Portland's IEP is adequate and appropriate to ensure\n\nthe requisite degree of educational benefit.\n\n          On this score, appellants' cardinal contention is  that\n\nPortland's  IEP  fails to  take  account  of Daniel's  inadequate\n\nsocial  skills.   We demur.   The  record  reflects that  the IEP\n\nforthrightly  addresses  this  area of  critical  need,  offering\n\nDaniel  an array  of  after-school socialization  services.   For\n\nexample, Daniel would spend three hours a day, three days a week,\n\nwith a social skills facilitator, who would encourage and oversee\n\nhis   involvement   in   extracurricular    and   community-based\n\nactivities.   The facilitator would  work to hone Daniel's skills\n\nin  relating to non-disabled peers  in a real-world  milieu.8  On\n\nthe  remaining school  days, Daniel  would receive  social skills\n\nprogramming  in  more   structured  environments,  spending   one\n\nafternoon at  a one-on-one  counseling session with  a doctorate-\n\nlevel psychologist  and the other  in the company  of handicapped\n\npeers  at  a  group  counseling session  devoted  to  self-esteem\n\n                    \n\n     8To be sure, there is room for principled disagreement about\nthe  efficacy  of  a   social  skills  facilitator.    Portland's\nwitnesses  and  plaintiffs'  experts  expressed  widely divergent\nviews  on this  topic.   But,  judges  are not  especially  well-\nequipped  to choose  between  various educational  methodologies.\nSee  Rowley,  458  U.S. at  207-08.   Where,  as  here,  there is\n           \nsatisfactory  record  support  for  the  appropriateness  of  the\nparticular  approach  selected  by  the   school  department  and\napproved by the state education  agency, a reviewing court should\nnot  meddle.   See  id.;  see also  Roland  M., 910  F.2d  at 992\n                                              \n(warning that \"courts should  be loathe to intrude very  far into\ninterstitial details or to  become embroiled in captious disputes\nas to the precise efficacy of different instructional programs\").\n\n                                18\n\nissues.  Thus, while  Portland's IEP may not contain  the precise\n\nprograms  that the  parents  prefer, it  embodies a  substantial,\n\nsuitably diverse socialization component.\n\n          On the academic side, the IEP places Daniel in a small,\n\nspecial education class for English (with a student/teacher ratio\n\nof  eight-to-three)  and   four  mainstream  educational  courses\n\n(ranging in size  from fifteen to  eighteen students per  class).\n\nIn  the  mainstream classes  (at least  three  of which  would be\n\ntaught or  co-taught by a  special educator), Daniel  would study\n\nWestern  civilization,  mathematics,9 science,  and  an elective.\n\nThe  special English class would occupy the first period of every\n\nday and  would prepare Daniel organizationally  for the remainder\n\nof the  day.  A small  group session held during  the last period\n\nwould  help  Daniel  synthesize   the  day's  lessons,  hone  his\n\norganizational  skills,   and  teach  him   homework  strategies.\n\nPortland  also offered  (1) personalized  instruction in  custom-\n\ntailored  learning techniques, on a daily basis, to assist Daniel\n\nin mastering the curriculum; and (2) a home/school coordinator to\n\nwork  once a  week with  Daniel's mother  to synthesize  home and\n\ninstitutional instruction.\n\n          Under federal law, Portland's  IEP package must  assure\n\nDaniel a \"basic floor of [educational] opportunity.\"  Rowley, 458\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The finding that\n\n                    \n\n     9The   mainstream   math   class   contemplates   individual\ninstruction  geared  to  each  student's  level and  needs     an\nespecially  important  feature  given   the  nature  of  Daniel's\nhandicap  and the  problems he  has  encountered in  dealing with\napplied mathematics.\n\n                                19\n\nPortland's  proposal  at  least  reaches  this  floor  cannot  be\n\nfaulted.  The school committee tendered a rigorous program, to be\n\nadministered by a highly experienced  and well-credentialed team,\n\ncatering to the full range of Daniel's needs through a variety of\n\nmechanisms.10     The   academic  schedule,   with  its   mix  of\n\nmainstream   courses,   small-class   instruction,  and   private\n\nprogramming in compensatory skills, furnished abundant reason for\n\nthe hearing  officer and  the court  below to  find that  the IEP\n\nwould  likely  achieve  measured   success.11    The  IEP's  non-\n\nacademic  component     which  includes numerous  one-on-one  and\n\nsmall-group   services   geared  toward   fostering  self-esteem,\n\nenhancing   socialization   skills,   developing   organizational\n\nabilities, and  perfecting  homework  techniques     furnishes  a\n\nsatisfactory predicate for a similar  finding in respect to  non-\n\nacademic needs.\n\n          In   short,   Portland's  IEP   provides  \"personalized\n\ninstruction with sufficient  support services to permit  [Daniel]\n\nto  benefit educationally  from that  instruction.\"   Rowley, 458\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 203.  What is more, it allows Daniel to live at home with\n\n                    \n\n     10Appellants  criticize  the IEP  for  offering  no services\ngeared toward physical education or health management needs.   In\nfact, the IEP affords Daniel an individualized physical education\nprogram  as   well  as  a  choice   of  extracurricular  athletic\nactivities.   Since the record  fails to demonstrate  that Daniel\nsuffers an  infirmity in  motor coordination or  personal hygiene\nthat  would  require  specially  designed programs,  no  more  is\nrequired.\n\n     11Significantly, teachers who  had previously taught  Daniel\nin large,  mainstream classes  testified that he  participated in\nclass activities,  did  well,  felt  good  about  his  work,  and\nachieved passing grades.\n\n                                20\n\nsupportive parents,  to be educated with  non-disabled peers, and\n\nto  interact regularly with the  members of his  community.12  It\n\nfollows  inexorably  that   the  district  court's  findings   of\n\nappropriateness  and  adequacy  comfortably  survive  clear-error\n\nreview.\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.13   The  trial court  correctly\n\ndiscerned the relevant  legal principles and applied them  to the\n\ntask at  hand.  Its  conclusion that Portland's  proposed 1991-92\n\nIEP meets Daniel's  needs is supported by the record.  Finding no\n\nsignificant error of law or fact, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     12This  mainstream  approach, which  places  Daniel in  \"the\nleast  restrictive  environment\"  appropriate  to his  needs,  34\nC.F.R.    300.552(d) (1992), is  the preferred  choice under  the\nAct.

Despite the  parents' protests, a state\n\nhearing   officer   declared  the   school   committee's  1991-92\n\nindividualized  education  program  (IEP)  appropriate   for  the\n\nchild's needs and  in compliance  with federal law.   The  United\n\nStates  District  Court  for the  District  of  Maine upheld  the\n\nfinding.  We affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Daniel Lenn, a minor, is handicapped within the meaning\n\nof  the Individuals  with Disabilities  Education Act  (IDEA), 20\n\nU.S.C.     1400-1485  (1988 &amp;  Supp.  III 1991).1   Daniel  has a\n\nsevere, non-verbal learning disability connected with the brain's\n\nright hemisphere.  While his verbal IQ test scores are average to\n\nlow  average,  Daniel   has  difficulty  interpreting  non-verbal\n\nmessages, such  as facial cues.   He has a short  attention span,\n\nlacks  the ability to intake, process, or retrieve information in\n\nan  organized   way,   possesses  poor   visual   memory,   often\n\nmisperceives the  world around him, and  pays excessive attention\n\nto  small details.   His  disability inhibits  social interaction\n\nwith peers and impedes academic progress.\n\n          Daniel attended the Portland, Maine public schools as a\n\n                    \n\n     1In their complaint, the  plaintiffs also invoke section 504\nof  the Rehabilitation Act, 29  U.S.C.   794  (1988).  Concluding\nthat the sweep  of the two statutes is identical  for purposes of\nthis  case,  the parties  have  briefed and  argued  their points\nsolely with  reference to the IDEA.   We assume arguendo that the\n                                                        \nparties'  assessment is accurate.  Hence, we analyze the assigned\nerrors under the IDEA.\n\n                                2\n\nspecial  education student  through the eighth  grade.   While he\n\nadvanced from year to year,  his attainments fell steadily behind\n\nthose of  his peers.  His  progress slowed to a  crawl during the\n\n1989-90  and  1990-91 school  years.   By  July 1991,  Daniel had\n\ncompleted  the  eighth  grade;  nevertheless,  his  reading   and\n\nmathematical calculation  scores were  at  roughly a  sixth-grade\n\nlevel  and his score in applied mathematics was at a second-grade\n\nlevel.\n\n          Daniel's eighth-grade year (1990-91) was interrupted by\n\na  one-month  midwinter  hospital  stay,  during  which  treating\n\nprofessionals illuminated the nature  and extent of his cognitive\n\ndisability.  That July,  Daniel's parents placed him in  a summer\n\nprogram at Eagle Hill,  a private school in Massachusetts.   They\n\nalso contacted the Cleveland Clinic  and arranged to have  Daniel\n\nundergo  a series  of additional  educational, neurological,  and\n\npsychological  examinations.     Relying  in  part   on  the  new\n\ninformation generated through  the Lenns'  efforts, the  Portland\n\nSchool  Committee (Portland) shifted  gears, scrapped  several of\n\nits earlier  (unsuccessful) approaches,  and proposed an  IEP for\n\nDaniel's   ninth-grade   education    that   contained    several\n\ninnovations.  Nevertheless, Daniel's parents rejected the public-\n\nschool-based program, unilaterally enrolled Daniel as a full-time\n\nresidential  student at Eagle  Hill,2 and requested  a hearing on\n\nthe IEP's adequacy.\n\n                    \n\n     2Daniel is  still  in residence  at  Eagle Hill,  albeit  at\nconsiderable expense to the Lenns.\n\n                                3\n\n          After pondering testimony  from eighteen witnesses  and\n\nreviewing numerous exhibits, the  state hearing officer concluded\n\nthat  Portland's IEP for the 1991-92  school year was \"reasonably\n\ncalculated  to  be  of  significant  educational  benefit  in  an\n\nenvironment  which is  much  less restrictive  than Eagle  Hill.\"\n\nAccordingly, he  rejected the  Lenns' remonstrance.   The federal\n\ndistrict  court upheld  the  agency determination.   This  appeal\n\nensued.3\n\nII.  STATUTORY OVERVIEW\n\n          We  start  our substantive  discussion  by  parsing the\n\nstatutory scheme and describing how,  and to what extent, parents\n\nor guardians displeased by a school board's response to a child's\n\nhandicap may seek judicial review of an IEP.\n\n                                A\n\n          To qualify  for federal funding under the IDEA, a state\n\nmust  offer  \"all  children  with  disabilities  .  .  .  a  free\n\nappropriate public  education.\"   20 U.S.C.     1400(c), 1412(1).\n\nIn this context, appropriateness requires that  the instructional\n\nplan  be  custom  tailored  to address  the  handicapped  child's\n\n\"unique  needs,\"  20  U.S.C.    1400(c),  in  a  way  \"reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the  child to receive educational benefits.\"\n\nBoard of Educ. v.

The Act sets more modest goals:  it\n\nemphasizes an  appropriate, rather  than an ideal,  education; it\n\nrequires   an   adequate,   rather   than   an   optimal,    IEP.\n\nAppropriateness and adequacy are terms of moderation.  It follows\n\nthat, although an IEP must afford some educational benefit to the\n\nhandicapped  child,  the benefit  conferred  need  not reach  the\n\nhighest attainable level or even the level needed to maximize the\n\nchild's  potential.  See Rowley, 458 U.S.  at 198; Roland M., 910\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 992.\n\n          The   IDEA   also   articulates   a    preference   for\n\n                                5\n\nmainstreaming.

CLAIMED ERRORS OF LAW\n\n          In an  effort to  sidestep clear-error review  and take\n\nshelter  in the lee of  a more accommodating  standard, the Lenns\n\nattribute two  errors of law  to the  court below.   They contend\n\nthat  the court (1) applied  the wrong legal  yardstick in taking\n\nthe  measure of  the hearing officer's  findings; and  (2) failed\n\nsufficiently to address each  of Daniel's identified  educational\n\nneeds in determining the adequacy of Portland's proposed IEP.  We\n\ndiscuss these contentions seriatim.\n                                  \n\n                                8\n\n                                A\n\n          Appellants'  flagship claim  is  that  the lower  court\n\naffirmed the hearing  officer's decision  without conducting  the\n\nindependent evidentiary review that the IDEA requires.  The claim\n\nfounders:   the  record  below contains  all  the earmarks  of  a\n\nsuitably deferential, yet suitably independent, judicial inquiry.\n\n          The linchpin of this conclusion is the district court's\n\nopinion.  In it,  Judge Brody explains a reviewing  court's duty,\n\ncanvasses  the   pertinent  authorities,  and   acknowledges  the\n\nrelationship  between  the  hearing  officer's findings  and  the\n\ndistrict court's oversight function, concluding that  \"while [the\n\ndistrict]  court must  make an  independent ruling,  [its] review\n\nmust  be something  short of  de novo.\"   Lenn  v.  Portland Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nComm., No.  92-0011-P-H, slip op. at 6 (D. Me. Dec. 14, 1992) (D.\n     \n\nCt. Op.).  The court's discussion could hardly be more pointed or\n\nmore accurate.\n\n          In  the face of this pellucid prose, appellants have an\n\nuphill battle.  They argue that, although the district judge gave\n\nlip  service  to the  correct  standard, he  actually  viewed the\n\nevidence through  a much  more deferential  glass.   We recognize\n\nthat  actions sometimes speak louder  than words.   Thus, a trial\n\ncourt  cannot satisfy its oversight obligation in an IDEA case by\n\nreciting the catechism of independent review and  then failing to\n\npractice  what it  preaches.   But when,  as now,  a  trial court\n\ndelineates the proper  rule of decision,  citing book and  verse,\n\nthe burden  of demonstrating  that the court  is merely  mouthing\n\n                                9\n\nempty platitudes rests with the party who mounts the  accusation.\n\nThis  is  a  heavy burden;  it  cannot  be  carried by  perfervid\n\nrhetoric  or glib wordplay.   To  prevail on  such a  theory, the\n\naccuser  must offer solid indications  that the district court in\n\nfact  strayed  from  the straight  and  narrow.    After all,  an\n\nappellate tribunal  ought not lightly assume that a federal trial\n\njudge  is  indulging in  the adjudicatory  equivalent of  a shell\n\ngame.\n\n          In  this instance,  we  think the  accusation that  the\n\njudge said one  thing, but did another, is unfounded.  The Lenns'\n\nmost touted point  is their asseveration that  the district court\n\nexpressly  invoked the clear-error standard when  it noted that a\n\ncourt  is \"not confined to the hearing officer's decision if [it]\n\nfind[s] clear error.\"  D. Ct. Op. at 10.  Based primarily on this\n\nremark,4 appellants invite us  to disregard the court's professed\n\nallegiance to the  correct standard  of review.   We decline  the\n\ninvitation.\n\n          First and foremost, we simply cannot credit appellants'\n\nargument  that  this  isolated  reference  indicates  a wholesale\n\n                    \n\n     4The district court also wrote that it found \"ample evidence\nin the record\" to support the hearing officer's decision.  D. Ct.\nOp. at 10.   Appellants  argue that this  statement manifests  an\nabandonment  of  the  preponderance-of-the-evidence test.    This\nargument  proves  nothing  more  than  appellants'  penchant  for\ngrasping  at straws    especially since  the context  makes clear\nthat the lower court applied the proper test; indeed, in the very\nsame  paragraph  of  its  opinion,  the  court  used  the  phrase\n\"preponderance  of the evidence.\"   Id.  We  will neither confine\n                                       \ndistrict courts to the rote recitation of buzzwords  nor penalize\nthem   for  relieving  the  tedium  of  opinion  writing  by  the\noccasional employment of artful synonyms.\n\n                                10\n\nabandonment of the principles of independent review.  We think it\n\nis  far more likely, all things considered, that the reference to\n\n\"clear error\" represents simply an infelicitous choice of phrase.\n\nIndeed, a close perusal of the record makes manifest the depth of\n\njudicial  involvement and  provides  clinching evidence  that the\n\ndistrict  judge  utilized  the approved  level  of  review.   The\n\ntranscript reveals that the judge took a hands-on approach to the\n\ndecisional process.  Instead of limiting his perscrutation to the\n\nadministrative  record, he  conducted  what amounted  to a  mini-\n\ntrial, hearing testimony  from two  witnesses regarding  Daniel's\n\neducational  needs  and  receiving  newly  emergent documentation\n\nchronicling  Daniel's progress  at  Eagle Hill.   The  judge then\n\ncarefully scrutinized all the evidence, new and old, and drew his\n\nown conclusions  from  it.   This is  the very  stuff from  which\n\nindependent review is fashioned.\n\n          We have said enough.  The law does not require district\n\ncourts to be precise to the point of pedantry.   Consequently, an\n\nappellate court must  not hesitate to excuse  an awkward locution\n\nand give  a busy trial judge  a bit of breathing room.   If using\n\nthe  wrong word  or phrase  constituted grounds  for reversal  in\n\nevery  case, much  too high  a premium  would be placed  on sheer\n\nliteralism.   We have  regularly refused  to exact that  premium.\n\nSee,  e.g., Roland M., 910 F.2d at 991 n.4 (disregarding district\n                     \n\ncourt's \"infelicitous\" choice of terminology  where \"the context,\n\nand other statements in  the court's memorandum\" made  plain that\n\nthe  court  fully  understood  the  operative  legal  principle);\n\n                                11\n\nCollins v.

Mindful that pettifoggery, for its own sake,\n\nbenefits  no one,  we  will not  disregard  the totality  of  the\n\ncircumstances  in  a  headlong  rush to  elevate  formalism  over\n\nsubstance.\n\n          We add,  moreover, that  even if Judge  Brody used  the\n\nchallenged  terminology  in a  purposeful  manner,  we would  not\n\nreverse.  The \"clear  error\" reference appears in a  paragraph in\n\nwhich, after restating the hearing  officer's key findings   that\n\nthe 1991-92 IEP  offered Daniel  a major change  in services  and\n\nthat   the  new  mix  was   reasonably  calculated  to  bestow  a\n\nsignificant educational  benefit on him    the judge acknowledged\n\nhis  duty to afford the administrative proceeding due weight.5  A\n\n                    \n\n     5The court wrote:  \"While we are not confined to the hearing\nofficer's  decision if we find clear error, we are constrained in\nthat we cannot  impose our view of preferable educational methods\n\n                                12\n\nreference at this  juncture to clear  error is not  inappropriate\n\nsince the precise  degree of deference attributable  to a hearing\n\nofficer's subsidiary findings of fact in an IDEA  case ultimately\n                    \n\nrests  within the trial court's  discretion.  See, e.g., Hampton,\n                                                                \n\n976  F.2d at 52; Westmoreland,  930 F.2d at  946; Burlington, 736\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  792.    That  the  district  court  may  have  afforded\n\nparticular  administrative  findings substantial  respect    even\n\ndeference  on a  par with  clearly erroneous  review    would not\n\ncomprise  reversible  error   so  long  as  the   court  made  an\n\nindependent  ruling   as  to  the  IEP's  adequacy   based  on  a\n\npreponderance   of  all  the   evidence,  including  the  hearing\n\nofficer's duly weighted findings.\n\n          This  criterion was satisfied.   The opinion as a whole\n\nshows   conclusively   that   the  judge   made   an  independent\n\ndetermination concerning the adequacy of Portland's IEP, throwing\n\nall the available  evidence into  the pot.   Among other  things,\n\nJudge  Brody  specifically discussed  the  testimony  of Daniel's\n\nteachers  in Portland,  the testimony  of the  Cleveland Clinic's\n\nindependent  evaluators, and  Daniel's standardized  test scores.\n\nD.

He also cited additional record evidence that\n\nbuttressed  the  hearing  officer's evaluation  of  Daniel's past\n\nprogress in  the Portland  public schools  and the likelihood  of\n\nfuture   educational  benefits   should   the   1991-92  IEP   be\n\nimplemented.  Id.  at 10.  Last, but surely  not least, the judge\n                 \n\napplied the proper burden of proof, concluding that the Lenns had\n\n                    \n\nupon the state.\"  D. Ct.

Hence, we find no warping of the standard of review.

Appellants' Reply  Brief at\n\n11.   Building on this premise, appellants then conclude that the\n\ncourt below  emasculated the  requirement by failing  to consider\n\n                    \n\n     6While the Lenns grudgingly acknowledge this reference, they\nmaintain that the  court erred  by requiring them  to prove  that\nonly Eagle Hill will provide Daniel with an appropriate education\n    \nwhen,   in  fact,   their   burden  was   merely  to   prove  the\ninappropriateness of  Portland's  IEP.   On  balance, we  do  not\nbelieve it can fairly  be said that the court  misapprehended the\ncontours  of  the issue.    Throughout  its pages,  the  district\ncourt's  opinion  is  geared   toward  determining  whether  \"the\nproposed  IEP  was  reasonably  calculated to  enable  Daniel  to\nreceive educational benefits.\"   D. Ct. Op. at  10.  Indeed,  the\ncourt pointedly wrote that \"[a]lthough the Eagle Hill residential\nprogram may well be the ideal educational environment for Daniel,\nthat is not the legal standard under [the] IDEA.\"  Id.   \n                                                      \nThis specific  disclaimer sounds the death  knell for appellants'\nargument.\n\n                                14\n\n\"separately\"  and \"directly\"  whether  Portland's  IEP  addressed\n\nDaniel's non-academic needs in a meaningfully beneficial way.

Because  a  one-\n\ndimensional view of an  IEP would afford too narrow  a foundation\n\nfor a determination that the program  is reasonably calculated to\n\nprovide \"effective results\" and \"demonstrable improvement\" in the\n\nvarious  \"educational and personal  skills identified  as special\n\nneeds,\"  Burlington,   736  F.2d  at  788,   a  district  court's\n                   \n\ndetermination  that  an IEP  complies  with  the Act  necessarily\n\ninvolves a host of subsidiary determinations. \n\n          Be  that  as  it  may,  appellants'  legal  formulation\n\ndistorts the Act's requirements.   The Act does not  mandate, nor\n\nhas any court held  it to require, that  the district judge  must\n\nconsider  each  unique  need in  isolation  and  make a  separate\n\nfinding regarding the  preponderance of the evidence in  each and\n\n                                15\n\nevery  identified area.  Such a requirement would serve merely to\n\nbalkanize the  concept of educational  benefit and to  burden the\n\ndistrict courts without producing  any offsetting advantages.  We\n\nhold that no such requirement exists.  In the last analysis, what\n\nmatters  is  not whether  the district  judge  makes a  series of\n\nsegregable findings,  but whether the  judge is cognizant  of all\n\nthe  child's special needs and considers the IEP's offerings as a\n\nunitary whole, taking those special needs into proper account.\n\n          The   record   also  belies   appellants'  self-serving\n\nsuggestion  that  the district  court assessed  Daniel's academic\n\nneeds in  a vacuum.    A trial court charged  with evaluating the\n\nadequacy of an  IEP cannot be said to  have committed legal error\n\nas long as (1)  it does not overlook  or misconstrue evidence  of\n\nrecord,  and (2) its overall decision is based upon a supportable\n\nfinding  that the  program  described in  the  IEP is  reasonably\n\ncalculated to address  the handicapped child's  education-related\n\nneeds,  both academic  and  non-academic.   The district  court's\n\nfinding in this  case fits  comfortably within that  rubric.   We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n          The  district  court explicitly  acknowledged \"Daniel's\n\nself-esteem and social skills  needs\" and took pains to  limn the\n\n\"wide  range  of  after-school   support  services\"  proposed  by\n\nPortland  to  address those  needs.    D.  Ct.  Op.  at  8.    In\n\nconsidering  the  likely  impact  of these  services,  the  court\n\nfocused on Portland's plan to provide a social skills facilitator\n\nand opined that, although  hiring a facilitator might not  be the\n\n                                16\n\nbest mechanism for addressing Daniel's needs, \"the ideal\" is  not\n\n\"the legal standard under [the]  IDEA.\"  Id. at 10; see  also id.\n                                                                 \n\nat  12.  The court observed that Portland's program would \"enable\n\nDaniel  to remain in his  home community and  interact daily with\n\nnon-disabled  peers,\"  id.  at  10, thus  furthering  his  social\n                          \n\ndevelopment.7    Finally, the  judge  mentioned  that while  \"the\n\ngoals for  Daniel's social  and organizational skill  development\n\nwould  be more useful if they could be objectively measured,\" id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 11 n.2, this deficiency does not undermine the IEP.\n\n          Based on these, and other comments, it is clear  beyond\n\nhope of contradiction that Portland's ability to address Daniel's\n\nnon-academic   needs  informed   the  district   court's  overall\n\ndetermination that the IEP  comports with the Act's requirements.\n\nNo more is exigible.\n\nIV.  WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Appellants' final  assignment of error posits  that the\n\ndistrict court blundered in  concluding that Portland's IEP would\n\n                    \n\n     7We do not accept appellants' hypothesis that the mainstream\nnature of a proposed  placement can never enter into  the primary\nanalysis  of an  IEP's  adequacy.   When  a child,  like  Daniel,\ndemonstrates a particular need for  learning how to interact with\nnon-disabled peers, a mainstream placement will almost inevitably\nhelp to  address that need.   Such an  integral aspect of  an IEP\npackage  cannot be  ignored  when judging  the program's  overall\nadequacy and appropriateness.   The Third Circuit, which recently\nreaffirmed the  special nature  of the educational  benefits that\nmainstream  programs confer,  apparently shares  this view.   See\n                                                                 \nOberti v. Board of Educ.,     F.2d    ,     (3d  Cir. 1993) [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span>\n                        \n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>  <span class=\"page\">178480</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *9]  (observing  that, in  assessing the  educational\nbenefit  of placing  a  handicapped  child  with  non-handicapped\npeers,  \"the  court must  pay special  attention to  those unique\nbenefits  the child  may  obtain from  integration  in a  regular\nclassroom  .   .  .,   i.e.,  the  development   of  social   and\n                           \ncommunication skills from interaction with nondisabled peers\").\n\n                                17\n\nprovide Daniel with an appropriate public education.  We  discern\n\nno clear error.   To  the contrary, the  record fully sustains  a\n\nfinding that Portland's IEP is adequate and appropriate to ensure\n\nthe requisite degree of educational benefit.\n\n          On this score, appellants' cardinal contention is  that\n\nPortland's  IEP  fails to  take  account  of Daniel's  inadequate\n\nsocial  skills.   We demur.   The  record  reflects that  the IEP\n\nforthrightly  addresses  this  area of  critical  need,  offering\n\nDaniel  an array  of  after-school socialization  services.   For\n\nexample, Daniel would spend three hours a day, three days a week,\n\nwith a social skills facilitator, who would encourage and oversee\n\nhis   involvement   in   extracurricular    and   community-based\n\nactivities.   The facilitator would  work to hone Daniel's skills\n\nin  relating to non-disabled peers  in a real-world  milieu.8  On\n\nthe  remaining school  days, Daniel  would receive  social skills\n\nprogramming  in  more   structured  environments,  spending   one\n\nafternoon at  a one-on-one  counseling session with  a doctorate-\n\nlevel psychologist  and the other  in the company  of handicapped\n\npeers  at  a  group  counseling session  devoted  to  self-esteem\n\n                    \n\n     8To be sure, there is room for principled disagreement about\nthe  efficacy  of  a   social  skills  facilitator.    Portland's\nwitnesses  and  plaintiffs'  experts  expressed  widely divergent\nviews  on this  topic.   But,  judges  are not  especially  well-\nequipped  to choose  between  various educational  methodologies.\nSee  Rowley,  458  U.S. at  207-08.   Where,  as  here,  there is\n           \nsatisfactory  record  support  for  the  appropriateness  of  the\nparticular  approach  selected  by  the   school  department  and\napproved by the state education  agency, a reviewing court should\nnot  meddle.   See  id.;  see also  Roland  M., 910  F.2d  at 992\n                                              \n(warning that \"courts should  be loathe to intrude very  far into\ninterstitial details or to  become embroiled in captious disputes\nas to the precise efficacy of different instructional programs\").\n\n                                18\n\nissues.  Thus, while  Portland's IEP may not contain  the precise\n\nprograms  that the  parents  prefer, it  embodies a  substantial,\n\nsuitably diverse socialization component.\n\n          On the academic side, the IEP places Daniel in a small,\n\nspecial education class for English (with a student/teacher ratio\n\nof  eight-to-three)  and   four  mainstream  educational  courses\n\n(ranging in size  from fifteen to  eighteen students per  class).\n\nIn  the  mainstream classes  (at least  three  of which  would be\n\ntaught or  co-taught by a  special educator), Daniel  would study\n\nWestern  civilization,  mathematics,9 science,  and  an elective.\n\nThe  special English class would occupy the first period of every\n\nday and  would prepare Daniel organizationally  for the remainder\n\nof the  day.  A small  group session held during  the last period\n\nwould  help  Daniel  synthesize   the  day's  lessons,  hone  his\n\norganizational  skills,   and  teach  him   homework  strategies.\n\nPortland  also offered  (1) personalized  instruction in  custom-\n\ntailored  learning techniques, on a daily basis, to assist Daniel\n\nin mastering the curriculum; and (2) a home/school coordinator to\n\nwork  once a  week with  Daniel's mother  to synthesize  home and\n\ninstitutional instruction.\n\n          Under federal law, Portland's  IEP package must  assure\n\nDaniel a \"basic floor of [educational] opportunity.\"  Rowley, 458\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The finding that\n\n                    \n\n     9The   mainstream   math   class   contemplates   individual\ninstruction  geared  to  each  student's  level and  needs     an\nespecially  important  feature  given   the  nature  of  Daniel's\nhandicap  and the  problems he  has  encountered in  dealing with\napplied mathematics.\n\n                                19\n\nPortland's  proposal  at  least  reaches  this  floor  cannot  be\n\nfaulted.  The school committee tendered a rigorous program, to be\n\nadministered by a highly experienced  and well-credentialed team,\n\ncatering to the full range of Daniel's needs through a variety of\n\nmechanisms.10     The   academic  schedule,   with  its   mix  of\n\nmainstream   courses,   small-class   instruction,  and   private\n\nprogramming in compensatory skills, furnished abundant reason for\n\nthe hearing  officer and  the court  below to  find that  the IEP\n\nwould  likely  achieve  measured   success.11    The  IEP's  non-\n\nacademic  component     which  includes numerous  one-on-one  and\n\nsmall-group   services   geared  toward   fostering  self-esteem,\n\nenhancing   socialization   skills,   developing   organizational\n\nabilities, and  perfecting  homework  techniques     furnishes  a\n\nsatisfactory predicate for a similar  finding in respect to  non-\n\nacademic needs.\n\n          In   short,   Portland's  IEP   provides  \"personalized\n\ninstruction with sufficient  support services to permit  [Daniel]\n\nto  benefit educationally  from that  instruction.\"   Rowley, 458\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 203.  What is more, it allows Daniel to live at home with\n\n                    \n\n     10Appellants  criticize  the IEP  for  offering  no services\ngeared toward physical education or health management needs.   In\nfact, the IEP affords Daniel an individualized physical education\nprogram  as   well  as  a  choice   of  extracurricular  athletic\nactivities.   Since the record  fails to demonstrate  that Daniel\nsuffers an  infirmity in  motor coordination or  personal hygiene\nthat  would  require  specially  designed programs,  no  more  is\nrequired.\n\n     11Significantly, teachers who  had previously taught  Daniel\nin large,  mainstream classes  testified that he  participated in\nclass activities,  did  well,  felt  good  about  his  work,  and\nachieved passing grades.\n\n                                20\n\nsupportive parents,  to be educated with  non-disabled peers, and\n\nto  interact regularly with the  members of his  community.12  It\n\nfollows  inexorably  that   the  district  court's  findings   of\n\nappropriateness  and  adequacy  comfortably  survive  clear-error\n\nreview.\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.13   The  trial court  correctly\n\ndiscerned the relevant  legal principles and applied them  to the\n\ntask at  hand.  Its  conclusion that Portland's  proposed 1991-92\n\nIEP meets Daniel's  needs is supported by the record.  Finding no\n\nsignificant error of law or fact, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     12This  mainstream  approach, which  places  Daniel in  \"the\nleast  restrictive  environment\"  appropriate  to his  needs,  34\nC.F.R.    300.552(d) (1992), is  the preferred  choice under  the\nAct.  See 20 U.S.C.   1412(5); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202.\n                                              \n\n     13Appellants'   brief  is   larded   with  claims   that   a\nfundamentally  flawed process created  substantive infirmities in\nPortland's  IEP.   However,  in  the  district court,  appellants\nstipulated  to the  absence  of any  disputed procedural  issues.\nBecause these procedural claims have not been properly preserved,\nthey  need not be addressed in this  venue.
