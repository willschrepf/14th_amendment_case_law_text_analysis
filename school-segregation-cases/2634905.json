Gaynor for appellee.\n\n\n                            Pursuant to Code § 19.2-398(A)(2), the Commonwealth appeals the trial court’s decision\n\n              to grant appellee Abdul Rahman Cole’s motion to suppress evidence obtained during a strip\n\n              search of appellee. Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\n              appellee’s motion to suppress because it applied the wrong legal standard in assessing the\n\n              constitutionality of the jail’s strip search policy in light of the Supreme Court of the United\n\n              States’ holding in Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the Cnty. of Burlington, 132 S. Ct.\n\n              1510 (2012). We agree with the Commonwealth and thus, reverse the trial court’s decision and\n\n              remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n                            \n                                Pursuant to Code § 17.1-413, this opinion is not designated for publication.\n\f                                                               I. Background1\n\n              The evidence indicated that on April 8, 2014, Alexandria Police Officer Tony Moore\n\nstopped appellee’s vehicle for failure to maintain lane control. After stopping appellee, Officer\n\nMoore learned that he had an outstanding warrant in Arlington County for a failure to appear on\n\na DUI charge. During a search of appellee’s vehicle, Officer Moore found an open container of\n\nalcohol and a small round cigar containing what appeared to be marijuana inside of a\n\nMcDonald’s bag. After field-testing the substance in the cigar, Officer Moore told appellee that\n\nhe was charging him with possession of an open container and possession of marijuana and\n\ntransported appellee to the Alexandria Detention Center.\n\n              When Officer Moore and appellee arrived at the Alexandria Detention Center, Deputy\n\nRobert Roland met them in the sally port and conducted a pat-down search of appellee’s outer\n\nclothing and the inside of his pockets. Officer Moore informed Deputy Roland about the\n\nArlington warrant and the marijuana and open container charges. In light of the drug charge,\n\nDeputy Roland contacted his supervisor and obtained permission to “strip search” appellee.\n\n              Once in the room designated for strip searches, along with Officer Moore, Deputy Roland\n\nconducted a visual body cavity search of appellee, which included, among other requirements\n\nthat appellee bend or squat so that Deputy Roland could observe his genital and buttock region.\n\nThe search did not involve any physical contact from the officers. During the search, Officer\n\nMoore and Deputy Roland observed and, after a brief struggle with appellee, recovered a baggie\n\nfrom appellee’s buttocks, which contained fourteen rocks of crack cocaine and a small amount of\n\nmarijuana. After the strip search, Officer Moore then took appellee before the magistrate. There\n\n\n                                                            \n              1\n         As the parties are fully conversant with the record in this case and because this\nmemorandum opinion carries no precedential value, this opinion recites only those facts and\nincidents of the proceedings as are necessary to the parties’ understanding of the disposition of this\nappeal.\n                                                 -2-\n\fis no evidence in the appendix as to whether the magistrate released appellee on bond or ordered\n\nhim held in the detention facility.2\n\n              Subsequently, appellee moved to suppress, on two separate bases, the cocaine and\n\nmarijuana found in the baggie, and the trial court held a hearing on appellee’s motion on August\n\n28, 2014. At the hearing, Officer Moore testified consistent with the facts set forth above. In\n\naddition, Deputy Roland testified to the Alexandria Detention Center strip search policy in place\n\nwhen appellee was arrested. The policy required a strip search for any person being booked for a\n\ndrug or weapons charge, or for any crime of violence and required supervisors to approve a\n\nrequested strip search, which could be denied if the supervisor determined the immediate charge\n\ndid not justify the search. Detainees processed into the general population, however, are strip\n\nsearched regardless of the charges against them.\n\n              At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied appellee’s motion to suppress on\n\none of the grounds, and took the motion to suppress under advisement as to the constitutionality\n\nof the strip search. The trial court reconvened the hearing regarding the constitutionality of the\n\nstrip search on September 11, 2014. Prior to the trial court ruling on the motion to suppress, the\n\nCommonwealth requested permission to put on more evidence in particular regarding the layout\n\nof the jail, the strip search policy, and the supervisory process. The defense objected to\n\nre-opening the evidence. The trial court ruled that because “everybody missed the Florence\n\ndecision” prior to the first hearing, “it would be abuse of discretion not to allow the\n\n\n\n                                                            \n              2\n          Appellee was ultimately indicted on the felony charges of possession of cocaine with\nintent to sell, give, or distribute, second offense, in violation of Code § 18.2-248, and attempt to\nimpede a law enforcement officer by threats of bodily harm or force in violation of Code\n§ 18.2-460, as well as the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana with intent to\ndistribute in violation of Code § 18.2-248.1. Pursuant to the Court’s authority to hear this appeal\nunder Code § 19.2-398(A)(2), we only consider appellee’s felony charges.\n                                                               -3-\n\fCommonwealth to . . . and the defense the opportunity to open the evidentiary record and make a\n\nfull and complete record.”\n\n       Lieutenant Joseph Penkey then testified in more detail regarding the layout of the jail, the\n\nbooking area in particular, as well as the jail’s strip search policy. Lieutenant Penkey testified\n\nthat the first floor of the facility is “very mixed use” and includes the booking area, some\n\nspecialized housing units, the control center, the visitor center, as well as some disciplinary and\n\nadministrative segregation. Other floors contain the general population units. Inside the booking\n\narea there are twelve individual cells, three slightly larger cells that can each hold three\n\ndetainees, and four “fairly large cells” that can hold larger groups of detainees.\n\n       There is a small area with about eighteen to twenty seats in front of the booking counter\n\nwhere people waiting to be processed, waiting to see a magistrate or waiting to be released or go\n\nto court, may sit. People sitting in the booking area are not handcuffed unless their behavior\n\nrequires it. Nearby is a bank of phones where detainees are permitted to make phone calls.\n\nLieutenant Penkey noted that inmates from the general population may be held in the segregation\n\nunits or sober living unit on the first floor. Additionally, a general population inmate is usually\n\nassigned to clean the booking cells at night.\n\n       As for the jail’s strip search policy, Lieutenant Penkey testified that when arrestees first\n\narrive at the detention center, they are brought into a vehicle sally port where a deputy searches\n\ntheir outer clothing and pockets and takes certain property for safekeeping. If the arrestee is\n\nbeing charged with weapon or drug charges or weapons or drugs are found during the initial\n\nsearch of the arrestee, the deputy would contact the booking sergeant for a determination of\n\nwhether the person should be strip searched. Once it is determined that a prisoner will be strip\n\nsearched, the prisoner is escorted to a specific room for the search. If a detainee is not going to\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fbe strip searched, he is taken to the booking area to wait to see the magistrate and then continues\n\nwith the classification process. This process can take several hours.\n\n        Prisoners waiting to see a magistrate sit in the open booking area rather than in the group\n\ncells. Once they complete their initial processing, detainees usually are placed in group cells.\n\nDetainees granted bail usually remain in booking for about a day to give them an opportunity to\n\nmake bail before being sent to general population. When detainees exit their cells to use the\n\nshowers or the telephones, they may be in the same vicinity as the detainees awaiting booking\n\nwho sit in the seats across from the booking desk. Detainees awaiting booking are also allowed\n\nto walk into the bathroom, which is located in a unit adjacent to the booking station. Normally\n\nfour deputies work in the booking area. On average, about 25 detainees are in the booking area\n\neither in the cells or waiting to be processed in or out of the jail.\n\n        At the conclusion of the second hearing, the trial court granted appellee’s motion to\n\nsuppress the drugs found as a result of the strip search, holding that Florence was distinguishable\n\nand that this Court’s decision in King v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 717, 723, 644 S.E.2d 391,\n\n394 (2007), governed the present case. This appeal followed.\n\n                                             II. Analysis\n\n        We review the evidence “in a light most favorable to [appellee], the prevailing party\n\nbelow, and we grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.”\n\nCommonwealth v. Grimstead, 12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991) (quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Holloway, 9 Va. App. 11, 20, 384 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1989)). “‘Ultimate\n\nquestions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search’ involve\n\nquestions of both law and fact and are reviewed de novo on appeal.” McGee v. Commonwealth,\n\n25 Va. App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (quoting Ornelas v. United States,\n\n517 U.S. 690, 691 (1996)). “In performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court’s\n                                                  -5-\n\ffindings of historical fact unless ‘plainly wrong’ or without evidence to support them and we\n\ngive due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law\n\nenforcement officers.” Id. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (citing Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 699).\n\n              “Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer’s authority to conduct a ‘full search’ incident\n\nto arrest ‘is only skin deep.’” Craddock v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 539, 548, 580 S.E.2d\n\n454, 459 (2003) (quoting Commonwealth v. Gilmore, 27 Va. App. 320, 328, 498 S.E.2d 464,\n\n468 (1998)). “A different set of legal principles governs institutional searches of pretrial\n\ndetainees being processed for admission in the general population of a penal facility.” Id. at 549,\n\n580 S.E.2d at 459. Even in the detainee context, “The Fourth Amendment prohibits only\n\n‘unreasonable searches and seizures,’ Anderson v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 361, 363, 457\n\nS.E.2d 396, 397 (1995), not reasonable ones.” King v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 717, 723,\n\n644 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2007).\n\n                             “The test of reasonableness . . . is not capable of precise definition\n                             or mechanical application.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559\n                             (1979). For every case, this test “requires a balancing of the need\n                             for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that\n                             the search entails.” Id. Moreover, “[c]ourts must consider the\n                             scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\n                             conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which\n                             it is conducted.”3 Id.\n\nKing, 49 Va. App. at 723, 644 S.E.2d at 394 (footnote added).\n\n              The central issue before the Court is the applicability of Florence and the correct legal\n\nstandard to be applied to determine the constitutionality of the Alexandria Detention Center’s\n\nstrip search of appellee. At the outset, we note that a strip search that involves a stranger peering\n                                                            \n              3\n         We note that among the various types of searches performed on arrestees or detainees,\nthe type of search involved in the present case constituted a “visual body cavity search,” which\ngoes beyond a standard “strip search” (an “‘inspection of a naked individual, without any\nscrutiny of his body cavities’”) and “‘extends to a visual inspection of the anal and genital\nareas.’” Craddock, 40 Va. App. at 548, 580 S.E.2d at 459 (quoting Kidd v. Commonwealth, 38\nVa. App. 433, 446, 565 S.E.2d 337, 343 (2002)).\n                                                -6-\n\fwithout consent at a naked individual, and in particular at the most private portions of that\n\nperson’s body, is a serious invasion of privacy. The Supreme Court has said, in respect to a\n\nschoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the meaning of such a search, and the degradation\n\nits subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demanding\n\nits own specific suspicions. Safford Unified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009).\n\n        The Commonwealth argues that Florence announced a broad rule authorizing blanket\n\npolicies for strip searches of classes of detainees - without requiring reasonable suspicion to strip\n\nsearch individual detainees - in order to ensure jail security. Further, the Commonwealth asserts\n\nthat the trial court failed to apply the correct legal standard to its assessment of the jail’s policy in\n\nthis case, which requires that “deference must be given to the officials in charge of the jail unless\n\nthere is ‘substantial evidence’ demonstrating their response to the situation is exaggerated.”\n\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1518 (citing Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85 (1984)).\n\nAppellee, however, argues that Florence does not apply to the facts of this case because its\n\nholding does not extend to detainees whose detention statuses have not been reviewed by a\n\nmagistrate and who are held separately from the general population of a jail.\n\n        In Florence, the Supreme Court addressed the question of “whether undoubted security\n\nimperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be\n\nexempt from the more invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a\n\nconcealed weapon or other contraband.” Id. The petitioner in Florence was arrested on an\n\napparently outdated arrest warrant for a failure to appear at an enforcement hearing and taken\n\nfirst to a detention center and then transferred to a correctional facility before the warrant was\n\nultimately dismissed and he was released. Id. at 1514. At both facilities, petitioner was\n\nsubjected to visual body cavity searches pursuant to the facility procedures requiring these\n\nsearches of all detainees regardless of the circumstances of their arrests, their suspected offenses,\n                                                  -7-\n\fbehavior, demeanor, or criminal history. Id. Petitioner argued that “persons arrested for a minor\n\noffense could not be required to remove their clothing and expose the most private areas of their\n\nbodies to close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process.” Id. at 1514-15. “Rather\n\n. . . officials could conduct this kind of search only if they had reason to suspect a particular\n\ninmate of concealing a weapon, drugs, or other contraband.” Id. at 1515. The Court upheld the\n\nsearches and policies behind them, holding that “every detainee who will be admitted to the\n\ngeneral population may be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed.” Id. at\n\n1513.\n\n        In support of its holding, the Court underscored the “importance of deference to\n\ncorrectional officials” and acknowledged their “significant interest in conducting a thorough\n\nsearch as a standard part of the intake process.” Id. at 1516, 1518. Citing several studies, the\n\nCourt discussed the health and safety reasons supporting policies requiring strip searches for\n\ndetainees prior to their admission into a detention facility, and concluded that\n\n               [i]t is not surprising that correctional officials have sought to\n               perform thorough searches at intake for disease, gang affiliation,\n               and contraband. Jails are often crowded, unsanitary, and\n               dangerous places. There is substantial interest in preventing any\n               new inmate, either of his own will or as a result of coercion, from\n               putting all who live or work at these institutions at even greater\n               risk when he is admitted to the general population.\n\nId. at 1520. As extensively discussed in Florence, the proliferation of drugs or weapons\n\nthroughout a jail presents a serious security and health risk to all detainees and employees of the\n\nfacility. “The difficulties of operating a detention center must not be underestimated by the\n\ncourts.” Id. at 1515 (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987)). “Detecting contraband\n\nconcealed by new detainees . . . is a most serious responsibility. Weapons, drugs, and alcohol all\n\ndisrupt the safe operation of a jail.” Id. at 1519 (citation omitted). Drugs pose a specific risk in\n\nthat “[t]he use of drugs can embolden inmates in aggression toward officers or each other; and,\n                                                 -8-\n\feven apart from their use, the trade in these substances can lead to violent confrontations.” Id.\n\n(citation omitted). Indeed, “[s]omething as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a significant\n\ndanger. Inmates commit more than 10,000 assaults on correctional staff every year and many\n\nMore among themselves.” Id. (citing Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, J. Stephan &\n\nJ. Karberg, Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003)).\n\n       Given these serious concerns, the Court rejected petitioner’s argument that more invasive\n\nstrip searches need not be conducted for detainees not arrested for a serious crime or on weapon\n\nor drug charges because “the seriousness of the offense is a poor predictor of who has\n\ncontraband” and “it would be difficult in practice to determine whether individual detainees fall\n\nwithin the proposed exception.” Id. at 1520. Thus, Florence set forth a general rule that\n\ndetainees being admitted to the general population of a jail facility could be strip searched\n\nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion regardless of the severity of the charges they faced.\n\nId. at 1513.\n\n       The Commonwealth argues that Florence directly applies to the case at hand and\n\nauthorizes the type of visual body cavity search to which appellee was subjected. We agree. In\n\nthe present case, appellee was transported to the Alexandria Detention Center booking area,\n\nwhich may be populated by around 25 other detainees in various stages of the commitment\n\nprocess at any given time. The detainees in the booking area may be awaiting their appearance\n\nbefore a magistrate, awaiting payment of bond, going through the classification and assessment\n\nprocess before admission to the general population, or waiting to go to court. These detainees\n\nare not necessarily handcuffed and wait either in rows of plastic chairs in the common booking\n\narea, or held in group or individual cells on the first floor of the facility. The group cells hold a\n\nminimum of three detainees at any given time. “Most of the time,” detainees held in the booking\n\narea are placed in the group cells rather than the individual cells, which are generally reserved\n                                                 -9-\n\ffor detainees whose medical or behavioral status requires their isolation. Detainees are allowed\n\nto exit their cells, without handcuffs, to shower, use the bathroom, or make telephone calls.\n\nDuring those times they are usually escorted by officers; however there are usually only four\n\ndeputies working in the booking area.\n\n       General population inmates also travel through the booking area and other areas of the\n\nfirst floor. Some are held in the segregation or sober living unit and others may be assigned to\n\nclean the cells in the booking area at night. Additionally, general population inmates may pass\n\nthrough the booking area on their way to and from court.\n\n       The facts of this case align with, and therefore our conclusion is guided by, Florence.\n\nWhile appellee was not yet being processed into the “general population” of the jail, he was\n\nbeing admitted to the booking area where he would commingle with detainees who committed\n\ncrimes ranging in severity, were at various stages of the booking or commitment process, and all\n\nof whom presented possible opportunities for appellee to “pass off” the drugs hidden on his\n\nperson.  Maintaining safety and order at correctional institutions requires the expertise of\n\ncorrectional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the\n\nproblems they face. The Florence decision has confirmed the importance of deference to\n\ncorrectional officials and explained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional\n\nrights must be upheld if it “has a ‘valid, rational connection’ to a legitimate governmental\n\ninterest.” Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 132 (2003) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91).\n\nWe find that from the very well developed record in this matter and the particular facts\n\npresented, Florence authorizes a strip search here and therefore, the trial court erred by granting\n\nappellee’s motion to suppress.\n\n                                                                           Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f",

Background1\n\n              The evidence indicated that on April 8, 2014, Alexandria Police Officer Tony Moore\n\nstopped appellee’s vehicle for failure to maintain lane control. After stopping appellee, Officer\n\nMoore learned that he had an outstanding warrant in Arlington County for a failure to appear on\n\na DUI charge. During a search of appellee’s vehicle, Officer Moore found an open container of\n\nalcohol and a small round cigar containing what appeared to be marijuana inside of a\n\nMcDonald’s bag. After field-testing the substance in the cigar, Officer Moore told appellee that\n\nhe was charging him with possession of an open container and possession of marijuana and\n\ntransported appellee to the Alexandria Detention Center.\n\n              When Officer Moore and appellee arrived at the Alexandria Detention Center, Deputy\n\nRobert Roland met them in the sally port and conducted a pat-down search of appellee’s outer\n\nclothing and the inside of his pockets. Officer Moore informed Deputy Roland about the\n\nArlington warrant and the marijuana and open container charges. In light of the drug charge,\n\nDeputy Roland contacted his supervisor and obtained permission to “strip search” appellee.\n\n              Once in the room designated for strip searches, along with Officer Moore, Deputy Roland\n\nconducted a visual body cavity search of appellee, which included, among other requirements\n\nthat appellee bend or squat so that Deputy Roland could observe his genital and buttock region.\n\nThe search did not involve any physical contact from the officers. During the search, Officer\n\nMoore and Deputy Roland observed and, after a brief struggle with appellee, recovered a baggie\n\nfrom appellee’s buttocks, which contained fourteen rocks of crack cocaine and a small amount of\n\nmarijuana. After the strip search, Officer Moore then took appellee before the magistrate. There\n\n\n                                                            \n              1\n         As the parties are fully conversant with the record in this case and because this\nmemorandum opinion carries no precedential value, this opinion recites only those facts and\nincidents of the proceedings as are necessary to the parties’ understanding of the disposition of this\nappeal.\n                                                 -2-\n\fis no evidence in the appendix as to whether the magistrate released appellee on bond or ordered\n\nhim held in the detention facility.2\n\n              Subsequently, appellee moved to suppress, on two separate bases, the cocaine and\n\nmarijuana found in the baggie, and the trial court held a hearing on appellee’s motion on August\n\n28, 2014. At the hearing, Officer Moore testified consistent with the facts set forth above. In\n\naddition, Deputy Roland testified to the Alexandria Detention Center strip search policy in place\n\nwhen appellee was arrested. The policy required a strip search for any person being booked for a\n\ndrug or weapons charge, or for any crime of violence and required supervisors to approve a\n\nrequested strip search, which could be denied if the supervisor determined the immediate charge\n\ndid not justify the search. Detainees processed into the general population, however, are strip\n\nsearched regardless of the charges against them.\n\n              At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied appellee’s motion to suppress on\n\none of the grounds, and took the motion to suppress under advisement as to the constitutionality\n\nof the strip search. The trial court reconvened the hearing regarding the constitutionality of the\n\nstrip search on September 11, 2014. Prior to the trial court ruling on the motion to suppress, the\n\nCommonwealth requested permission to put on more evidence in particular regarding the layout\n\nof the jail, the strip search policy, and the supervisory process. The defense objected to\n\nre-opening the evidence. The trial court ruled that because “everybody missed the Florence\n\ndecision” prior to the first hearing, “it would be abuse of discretion not to allow the\n\n\n\n                                                            \n              2\n          Appellee was ultimately indicted on the felony charges of possession of cocaine with\nintent to sell, give, or distribute, second offense, in violation of Code § 18.2-248, and attempt to\nimpede a law enforcement officer by threats of bodily harm or force in violation of Code\n§ 18.2-460, as well as the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana with intent to\ndistribute in violation of Code § 18.2-248.1. Pursuant to the Court’s authority to hear this appeal\nunder Code § 19.2-398(A)(2), we only consider appellee’s felony charges.\n                                                               -3-\n\fCommonwealth to . . . and the defense the opportunity to open the evidentiary record and make a\n\nfull and complete record.”\n\n       Lieutenant Joseph Penkey then testified in more detail regarding the layout of the jail, the\n\nbooking area in particular, as well as the jail’s strip search policy. Lieutenant Penkey testified\n\nthat the first floor of the facility is “very mixed use” and includes the booking area, some\n\nspecialized housing units, the control center, the visitor center, as well as some disciplinary and\n\nadministrative segregation. Other floors contain the general population units. Inside the booking\n\narea there are twelve individual cells, three slightly larger cells that can each hold three\n\ndetainees, and four “fairly large cells” that can hold larger groups of detainees.\n\n       There is a small area with about eighteen to twenty seats in front of the booking counter\n\nwhere people waiting to be processed, waiting to see a magistrate or waiting to be released or go\n\nto court, may sit. People sitting in the booking area are not handcuffed unless their behavior\n\nrequires it. Nearby is a bank of phones where detainees are permitted to make phone calls.\n\nLieutenant Penkey noted that inmates from the general population may be held in the segregation\n\nunits or sober living unit on the first floor. Additionally, a general population inmate is usually\n\nassigned to clean the booking cells at night.\n\n       As for the jail’s strip search policy, Lieutenant Penkey testified that when arrestees first\n\narrive at the detention center, they are brought into a vehicle sally port where a deputy searches\n\ntheir outer clothing and pockets and takes certain property for safekeeping. If the arrestee is\n\nbeing charged with weapon or drug charges or weapons or drugs are found during the initial\n\nsearch of the arrestee, the deputy would contact the booking sergeant for a determination of\n\nwhether the person should be strip searched. Once it is determined that a prisoner will be strip\n\nsearched, the prisoner is escorted to a specific room for the search. If a detainee is not going to\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fbe strip searched, he is taken to the booking area to wait to see the magistrate and then continues\n\nwith the classification process. This process can take several hours.\n\n        Prisoners waiting to see a magistrate sit in the open booking area rather than in the group\n\ncells. Once they complete their initial processing, detainees usually are placed in group cells.\n\nDetainees granted bail usually remain in booking for about a day to give them an opportunity to\n\nmake bail before being sent to general population. When detainees exit their cells to use the\n\nshowers or the telephones, they may be in the same vicinity as the detainees awaiting booking\n\nwho sit in the seats across from the booking desk. Detainees awaiting booking are also allowed\n\nto walk into the bathroom, which is located in a unit adjacent to the booking station. Normally\n\nfour deputies work in the booking area. On average, about 25 detainees are in the booking area\n\neither in the cells or waiting to be processed in or out of the jail.\n\n        At the conclusion of the second hearing, the trial court granted appellee’s motion to\n\nsuppress the drugs found as a result of the strip search, holding that Florence was distinguishable\n\nand that this Court’s decision in King v.

Further, the Commonwealth asserts\n\nthat the trial court failed to apply the correct legal standard to its assessment of the jail’s policy in\n\nthis case, which requires that “deference must be given to the officials in charge of the jail unless\n\nthere is ‘substantial evidence’ demonstrating their response to the situation is exaggerated.”\n\nFlorence, 132 S.

Petitioner argued that “persons arrested for a minor\n\noffense could not be required to remove their clothing and expose the most private areas of their\n\nbodies to close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process.” Id. at 1514-15. “Rather\n\n. . . officials could conduct this kind of search only if they had reason to suspect a particular\n\ninmate of concealing a weapon, drugs, or other contraband.” Id. at 1515. The Court upheld the\n\nsearches and policies behind them, holding that “every detainee who will be admitted to the\n\ngeneral population may be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed.” Id. at\n\n1513.\n\n        In support of its holding, the Court underscored the “importance of deference to\n\ncorrectional officials” and acknowledged their “significant interest in conducting a thorough\n\nsearch as a standard part of the intake process.” Id. at 1516, 1518. Citing several studies, the\n\nCourt discussed the health and safety reasons supporting policies requiring strip searches for\n\ndetainees prior to their admission into a detention facility, and concluded that\n\n               [i]t is not surprising that correctional officials have sought to\n               perform thorough searches at intake for disease, gang affiliation,\n               and contraband. Jails are often crowded, unsanitary, and\n               dangerous places. There is substantial interest in preventing any\n               new inmate, either of his own will or as a result of coercion, from\n               putting all who live or work at these institutions at even greater\n               risk when he is admitted to the general population.\n\nId. at 1520. As extensively discussed in Florence, the proliferation of drugs or weapons\n\nthroughout a jail presents a serious security and health risk to all detainees and employees of the\n\nfacility. “The difficulties of operating a detention center must not be underestimated by the\n\ncourts.” Id. at 1515 (citing Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84-85 (1987)). “Detecting contraband\n\nconcealed by new detainees . . . is a most serious responsibility. Weapons, drugs, and alcohol all\n\ndisrupt the safe operation of a jail.” Id. at 1519 (citation omitted). Drugs pose a specific risk in\n\nthat “[t]he use of drugs can embolden inmates in aggression toward officers or each other; and,\n                                                 -8-\n\feven apart from their use, the trade in these substances can lead to violent confrontations.” Id.\n\n(citation omitted). Indeed, “[s]omething as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a significant\n\ndanger. Inmates commit more than 10,000 assaults on correctional staff every year and many\n\nMore among themselves.” Id. (citing Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, J. Stephan &\n\nJ. Karberg, Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003)).\n\n       Given these serious concerns, the Court rejected petitioner’s argument that more invasive\n\nstrip searches need not be conducted for detainees not arrested for a serious crime or on weapon\n\nor drug charges because “the seriousness of the offense is a poor predictor of who has\n\ncontraband” and “it would be difficult in practice to determine whether individual detainees fall\n\nwithin the proposed exception.” Id. at 1520. Thus, Florence set forth a general rule that\n\ndetainees being admitted to the general population of a jail facility could be strip searched\n\nwithout individualized reasonable suspicion regardless of the severity of the charges they faced.\n\nId. at 1513.\n\n       The Commonwealth argues that Florence directly applies to the case at hand and\n\nauthorizes the type of visual body cavity search to which appellee was subjected. We agree. In\n\nthe present case, appellee was transported to the Alexandria Detention Center booking area,\n\nwhich may be populated by around 25 other detainees in various stages of the commitment\n\nprocess at any given time. The detainees in the booking area may be awaiting their appearance\n\nbefore a magistrate, awaiting payment of bond, going through the classification and assessment\n\nprocess before admission to the general population, or waiting to go to court. These detainees\n\nare not necessarily handcuffed and wait either in rows of plastic chairs in the common booking\n\narea, or held in group or individual cells on the first floor of the facility. The group cells hold a\n\nminimum of three detainees at any given time. “Most of the time,” detainees held in the booking\n\narea are placed in the group cells rather than the individual cells, which are generally reserved\n                                                 -9-\n\ffor detainees whose medical or behavioral status requires their isolation. Detainees are allowed\n\nto exit their cells, without handcuffs, to shower, use the bathroom, or make telephone calls.\n\nDuring those times they are usually escorted by officers; however there are usually only four\n\ndeputies working in the booking area.\n\n       General population inmates also travel through the booking area and other areas of the\n\nfirst floor. Some are held in the segregation or sober living unit and others may be assigned to\n\nclean the cells in the booking area at night. Additionally, general population inmates may pass\n\nthrough the booking area on their way to and from court.\n\n       The facts of this case align with, and therefore our conclusion is guided by, Florence.\n\nWhile appellee was not yet being processed into the “general population” of the jail, he was\n\nbeing admitted to the booking area where he would commingle with detainees who committed\n\ncrimes ranging in severity, were at various stages of the booking or commitment process, and all\n\nof whom presented possible opportunities for appellee to “pass off” the drugs hidden on his\n\nperson.  Maintaining safety and order at correctional institutions requires the expertise of\n\ncorrectional officials, who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the\n\nproblems they face. The Florence decision has confirmed the importance of deference to\n\ncorrectional officials and explained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional\n\nrights must be upheld if it “has a ‘valid, rational connection’ to a legitimate governmental\n\ninterest.” Overton v. Bazzetta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (2003) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91).\n\nWe find that from the very well developed record in this matter and the particular facts\n\npresented, Florence authorizes a strip search here and therefore, the trial court erred by granting\n\nappellee’s motion to suppress.\n\n                                                                           Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f</pre>",
