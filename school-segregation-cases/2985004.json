Associates, L.P.\r\n(“BKA”) purchased commercial property located on Luzon Street in Houston,\r\nTexas.<span>  </span>American First National Bank\r\n(“AFNB”) loaned BKA $210,000 to finance the purchase.<span>  </span>This loan was evidenced by a promissory note\r\nand secured by a deed of trust.<span>  </span>AFNB\r\nrecorded its first lien on this property by filing the deed of trust in the real\r\nproperty records of Harris County.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Approximately eight months later,\r\nBob Karim introduced Jason and Jared Huckabee, principals of The Sound Block\r\nInc., to his contacts at AFNB.<span>  </span>AFNB\r\nloaned Sound Block $180,000 to open a music rehearsal studio.<span>  </span>Karim personally guaranteed the loan, and BKA\r\nexecuted a second deed of trust on BKA’s Luzon Street property in favor of AFNB\r\nas collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span> \r\n</span>In connection with this transaction, BKA executed a third party pledge\r\nagreement in favor of AFNB as the secured party.<span>  </span>AFNB recorded its second lien on the Luzon\r\nStreet property by filing the deed of trust in the real property records of\r\nHarris County.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>BKA later decided to sell the Luzon\r\nStreet property.<span>  </span>David Lewis, acting on\r\nbehalf of Jordan-Lewis Development, executed an earnest money contract to\r\npurchase the Luzon Street property for $215,000.<span>  </span>The contract required BKA to convey the\r\nproperty to Jordan-Lewis Development at closing with no liens or security\r\ninterests that would not be satisfied out of the sales price.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Before the sale to Jordan-Lewis\r\nDevelopment closed and at Karim’s request, the executive committee of AFNB\r\napproved a modification to the Sound Block loan.<span>  </span>This approval was memorialized in a\r\nmemorandum, signed by AFNB’s president, who was also the chairman of the loan\r\ncommittee.<span>  </span>The memorandum showed that\r\nthe second lien on the Luzon Street property would be released and a\r\ncertificate of deposit to be held at AFNB in the amount of $55,000 would be\r\nadded as collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span> \r\n</span>The memorandum did not expressly require Karim or BKA to sign an\r\nadditional assignment or pledge.<span>  </span>An\r\nemail from Karim to AFNB and Alamo Title confirmed that Karim would “deposit” a\r\n$55,000 CD after receiving funds from closing the sale of the Luzon Street\r\nproperty and that Karim expected that to “clear” the lien.<span>  </span>Karim testified that in his conversation with\r\nAFNB about substituting collateral, there was no mention of a need for him to\r\nsign a pledge.<span>  </span>Karim understood that the\r\nCD would be collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span>  </span>Moreover, Karim had previously both\r\npersonally guaranteed the Sound Block loan and signed a third party pledge\r\nagreement on behalf of BKA.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\nparties to the sale of the Luzon Street property engaged Alamo Title as the\r\nescrow and closing agent. <span> </span>Alamo Title\r\nasked AFNB for a statement of the amounts required to extinguish the liens on\r\nthe property.<span>  </span>In response, AFNB sent a\r\npayoff statement, which indicated that the first lien could be satisfied by\r\npayment of $45,992.77 plus a per diem cost of approximately nine dollars.<span>  </span>The payoff statement also noted, “Per officer\r\ninstruction, the customer need provide a CD I/A/O $55,000.00 in order to\r\nrelease the second lien.” <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Westbound Bank loaned Jordan-Lewis\r\nDevelopment $188,000 toward the purchase.<span> \r\n</span>In connection with closing, Westbound Bank sent Alamo Title Company a\r\nletter with specific instructions for handling escrow and closing the\r\nsale.<span>  </span>This letter stated, “You are\r\ninstructed to close this loan transaction Loan, at Borrower’s expense, insuring\r\nWESTBOUND BANK a valid FIRST lien . . . .”<span> \r\n</span>The parties closed the transaction.<span> \r\n</span>Three days later, Jordan-Lewis Development and Westbound Bank funded the\r\npurchase price, and the sale proceeds were then disbursed.<span>  </span>The final seller’s statement showed a charge\r\nto seller at closing of $55,000 for “American First National Bank Certificate\r\nof Deposit.”<span>  </span>Documents from Alamo Title\r\nshow wire transfers to AFNB to pay off the first lien and to fund a certificate\r\nof deposit in the amount of $55,000.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\ncertificate of deposit was opened in Karim’s name, individually.<span>  </span>A stamp and notation on the front of the\r\ncertificate indicate that it was pledged as collateral.<span>  </span>The terms of the CD included the following\r\nexpress right of setoff granted in favor of AFNB:<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>SETOFF.<span>  </span>We may (without prior notice and when\r\npermitted by law) set off the funds in this account against any due and payable\r\ndebt you owe us now or in the future, by any of you having the right of\r\nwithdrawal, to the extent of such persons’ or legal entity’s right to\r\nwithdraw.<span>  </span>If the debt arises from a\r\nnote, “any due and payable debt” includes the total amount of which we are\r\nentitled to demand payment under the terms of the note at the time we set off,\r\nincluding any balance the due date for which we properly accelerate [illegible]\r\nthe note.<span>  </span>We will not be liable for the\r\ndishonor of any check [illegible] the dishonor occurs because we set off a debt\r\nagainst this amount.<span>  </span>You agree to hold\r\nus harmless from any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of\r\nsetoff.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>AFNB’s general ledger shows the transaction opening\r\na CD in the amount of $55,000 “to pledge LN #11372, The Sound Block.”<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>While BKA’s sale of the Luzon\r\nStreet property was pending, an AFNB loan assistant sent an email asking Karim\r\nto sign certain attached documents.<span>  </span>The\r\nsubject-line of the email read: “the documents need to be sign.”<span>  </span>At trial, the loan assistant testified that\r\nshe asked Karim to sign a pledge agreement per the instructions she received\r\nfrom the loan officer.<span>  </span>She testified\r\nthat when Karim came to the bank after the sale proceeds had been disbursed,\r\nshe personally escorted him to the new account department and then told him to\r\ncontact her after the CD was opened so that she could prepare a pledge\r\nagreement for his signature in order to release the lien.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Karim’s\r\ntestimony contradicted the loan assistant’s testimony.<span>  </span>Karim testified that when he went to the\r\nbank, the new accounts department contacted the loan department.<span>  </span>Although Karim recalled the loan assistant\r\nmeeting him, he testified unequivocally that no AFNB representative told him he\r\nneeded to sign a pledge agreement or do anything other than open the CD.<span>  </span>He testified that he did everything required\r\nby AFNB:

App.</span><span>—</span><span>San Antonio 1936, no writ)).<span>  </span>When a lien is extinguished by the payment of\r\nthe indebtedness, the “extinguishment is complete even without a written\r\nrelease.”<span>  </span><i>Id.</i> <span> </span>The Texas Property Code\r\ndefines a “payoff statement” as “a statement of the amount of: (A) the unpaid\r\nbalance of a loan secured by a mortgage, including principal, interest, and\r\nother charges properly assessed under the loan documentation of the mortgage;\r\nand (B) interest on a per diem basis for the unpaid balance.”<span>  </span><span>Tex.\r\nProp. Code Ann.</span> § 12.017(a)(5) (West Supp. 2010).<span>  </span>The Property Code also provides for release\r\nof a lien based on satisfaction of the terms of the payoff statement.<span>  </span>It provides:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>An\r\nauthorized officer of a title insurance company or an authorized title\r\ninsurance agent may, on behalf of the mortgagor or a transferee of the\r\nmortgagor who acquired title to the property described in the mortgage, execute\r\nan affidavit that complies with the requirements of this section and record the\r\naffidavit in the real property records of each county in which the mortgage was\r\nrecorded.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>Id.</span></i><span>\r\n§ 12.017(c).<span>  </span>The statute prescribes\r\nthe form for the “Affidavit as Release of Lien” referenced in Section\r\n12.017(c).<span>  </span>That affidavit must provide,\r\namong other things, that the “[a]ffiant has ascertained that Title Company\r\ndelivered to Mortgagee payment of the loan secured by the mortgage in the\r\namount and time and to the location required by the payoff statement.”<span>  </span><i>Id.</i>\r\n§ 12.017(d).<span>  </span>It must also state\r\nthat “Pursuant to Section 12.017, Texas Property Code, this affidavit\r\nconstitutes a full and final release of the mortgage from the property.”<span>  </span><i>Id.</i><span>  </span>Considering the plain language of these\r\nstatutory provisions, we reject AFNB’s argument that a payoff statement is not\r\n“anything close to . . . binding.”<span> \r\n</span>Rather, we conclude that satisfaction of the debt underlying the lien,\r\nin an amount and manner as reflected in the payoff statement, extinguishes the\r\nlien.<span>  </span>To conclude otherwise would\r\ncontradict the Legislature’s plainly expressed intention, as reflected in the\r\nstatute providing that release of the lien may be established by a title\r\ncompany’s affidavit demonstrating that payment had been made according to the\r\nterms of the payoff statement.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Upon request, AFNB sent Alamo Title\r\na payoff statement indicating that the first lien could be satisfied by payment\r\nof $45,992.77 plus a per diem cost of $8.9291.<span> \r\n</span>The basis for this was the loan agreement and deed of trust underlying\r\nthe first lien.<span>  </span>The payoff statement\r\nfurther provided a payoff amount for the second lien of $55,000.00 with a note\r\nthat stated, “Per officer instruction, the customer need provide a CD I/A/O\r\n$55,000.00 in order to release the second lien.”<span>  </span>The basis for this was the memorandum\r\napproved by AFNB’s executive committee.<span> \r\n</span>The subject of this memorandum was “Total release the lien on R/E\r\nlocated at 1813 Luzon Street, Houston, TX 77009 being collateral of the subject\r\nnote [the Sound Block loan].”<span>  </span>The\r\nmemorandum stated that the original terms of the loan would be modified and the\r\nsecond lien would be released in exchange for an AFNB CD in the amount of\r\n$55,000. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The parties agree that after\r\nWestbound Bank funded Jordan-Lewis Development’s purchase of the Luzon Street\r\nproperty, Karim went to AFNB and opened a CD with the $55,000 that was transferred\r\nto AFNB as part of the real estate transaction.<span> \r\n</span>The parties also agree that Karim never executed an additional third-party\r\npledge agreement.<span>  </span>Even so, execution of\r\na pledge agreement was not required by either the payoff statement or AFNB’s memorandum\r\nmemorializing the agreement it reached with Karim as to substituting\r\ncollateral. <span> </span>In addition, the CD itself\r\nwas stamped “pledged” with a notation that it was collateral for the Sound\r\nBlock loan, and it included an express right of setoff.<span>  </span>As to the second lien, Karim satisfied the\r\nterms of the payoff statement and the agreement underlying it.<span>  </span>We conclude, as a matter of law, that his purchase\r\nof a $55,000 CD with AFNB extinguished the second lien.<span>  </span><i>See\r\nCaress</i>, 330 S.W.3d at 366.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>AFNB devotes much of its briefing\r\nto arguing that Jordan-Lewis Development and Westbound Bank lacked standing to\r\npursue a breach of contract claim because they lacked privity with respect to\r\nthe payoff statement.<span>  </span>Our decision, like\r\nthe trial court’s judgment, does not depend on a breach of contract\r\ntheory.<span>  </span>Because we decide only that\r\nsatisfaction of the requirements to release the second lien extinguished it, we\r\nneed not address any of the arguments relating to the standing of Jordan-Lewis\r\nDevelopment and Westbound Bank to pursue a contract action.<span>  </span>Rather, we conclude that Jordan-Lewis\r\nDevelopment and Westbound Bank

Associates, L.P.\r\n(“BKA”) purchased commercial property located on Luzon Street in Houston,\r\nTexas.<span>  </span>American First National Bank\r\n(“AFNB”) loaned BKA $210,000 to finance the purchase.<span>  </span>This loan was evidenced by a promissory note\r\nand secured by a deed of trust.<span>  </span>AFNB\r\nrecorded its first lien on this property by filing the deed of trust in the real\r\nproperty records of Harris County.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Approximately eight months later,\r\nBob Karim introduced Jason and Jared Huckabee, principals of The Sound Block\r\nInc., to his contacts at AFNB.<span>  </span>AFNB\r\nloaned Sound Block $180,000 to open a music rehearsal studio.<span>  </span>Karim personally guaranteed the loan, and BKA\r\nexecuted a second deed of trust on BKA’s Luzon Street property in favor of AFNB\r\nas collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span> \r\n</span>In connection with this transaction, BKA executed a third party pledge\r\nagreement in favor of AFNB as the secured party.<span>  </span>AFNB recorded its second lien on the Luzon\r\nStreet property by filing the deed of trust in the real property records of\r\nHarris County.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>BKA later decided to sell the Luzon\r\nStreet property.<span>  </span>David Lewis, acting on\r\nbehalf of Jordan-Lewis Development, executed an earnest money contract to\r\npurchase the Luzon Street property for $215,000.<span>  </span>The contract required BKA to convey the\r\nproperty to Jordan-Lewis Development at closing with no liens or security\r\ninterests that would not be satisfied out of the sales price.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Before the sale to Jordan-Lewis\r\nDevelopment closed and at Karim’s request, the executive committee of AFNB\r\napproved a modification to the Sound Block loan.<span>  </span>This approval was memorialized in a\r\nmemorandum, signed by AFNB’s president, who was also the chairman of the loan\r\ncommittee.<span>  </span>The memorandum showed that\r\nthe second lien on the Luzon Street property would be released and a\r\ncertificate of deposit to be held at AFNB in the amount of $55,000 would be\r\nadded as collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span> \r\n</span>The memorandum did not expressly require Karim or BKA to sign an\r\nadditional assignment or pledge.<span>  </span>An\r\nemail from Karim to AFNB and Alamo Title confirmed that Karim would “deposit” a\r\n$55,000 CD after receiving funds from closing the sale of the Luzon Street\r\nproperty and that Karim expected that to “clear” the lien.<span>  </span>Karim testified that in his conversation with\r\nAFNB about substituting collateral, there was no mention of a need for him to\r\nsign a pledge.<span>  </span>Karim understood that the\r\nCD would be collateral for the Sound Block loan.<span>  </span>Moreover, Karim had previously

statement.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Upon request, AFNB sent Alamo Title\r\na payoff statement indicating that the first lien could be satisfied by payment\r\nof $45,992.77 plus a per diem cost of $8.9291.<span> \r\n</span>The basis for this was the loan agreement and deed of trust underlying\r\nthe first lien.<span>  </span>The payoff statement\r\nfurther provided a payoff amount for the second lien of $55,000.00 with a note\r\nthat stated, “Per officer instruction, the customer need provide a CD I/A/O\r\n$55,000.00 in order to release the second lien.”<span>  </span>The basis for this was the memorandum\r\napproved by AFNB’s executive committee.<span> \r\n</span>The subject of this memorandum was “Total release the lien on R/E\r\nlocated at 1813 Luzon Street, Houston, TX 77009 being collateral of the subject\r\nnote [the Sound Block loan].”<span>  </span>The\r\nmemorandum stated that the original terms of the loan would be modified and the\r\nsecond lien would be released in exchange for an AFNB CD in the amount of\r\n$55,000. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The parties agree that after\r\nWestbound Bank funded Jordan-Lewis Development’s purchase of the Luzon Street\r\nproperty, Karim went to AFNB and opened a CD with the $55,000 that was transferred\r\nto AFNB as part of the real estate transaction.<span> \r\n</span>The parties also agree that Karim never executed an additional third-party\r\npledge agreement.<span>  </span>Even so, execution of\r\na pledge agreement was not required by either the payoff statement or AFNB’s memorandum\r\nmemorializing the agreement it reached with Karim as to substituting\r\ncollateral. <span> </span>In addition, the CD itself\r\nwas stamped “pledged” with a notation that it was collateral for the Sound\r\nBlock loan, and it included an express right of setoff.<span>  </span>As to the second lien, Karim satisfied the\r\nterms of the payoff statement and the agreement underlying it.<span>  </span>We conclude, as a matter of law, that his purchase\r\nof a $55,000 CD with AFNB extinguished the second lien.<span>
