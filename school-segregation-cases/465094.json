ARBUCKLE,\n\n               Attorney-Appellant.\n\f                          ORDER AND JUDGMENT *\n\n\nBefore KELLY, PORFILIO, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n      In the lead appeal, plaintiffs Brenda Harris and Larry Tolsma challenge the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to defendant American General\n\nFinance, Inc. (AGF) on their claims brought under the Real Estate Settlement\n\nProcedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2617. They also appeal the order\n\ndenying their request for a statutory penalty, as authorized by the Kansas\n\nConsumer Protection Act (KCPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-636(a). In the related\n\nappeal, plaintiffs challenge the amount of attorney fees awarded to their counsel.\n\nWe exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      We provide only a brief outline of the facts to explain the issues presented\n\nfor review. Plaintiffs financed their home and automobile through loans with\n\nAGF in two separate accounts. One of the accounts carried disability insurance.\n\nPlaintiffs directed the proceeds from the disability policy to be paid to AGF to\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties’ request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fbring both accounts current, and the rest to be paid to them. Instead, AGF\n\nretained all of the proceeds and applied them to the loans. During 2002, plaintiffs\n\ndirected various payments to one or the other of the loans, but AGF did not\n\nalways apply the payments as directed. Plaintiffs and their attorney sent at least\n\nfour letters to AGF concerning the payment directions. AGF responded to all but\n\nthe last letter, but did not adjust the loans to plaintiffs’ satisfaction.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed suit alleging AGF violated RESPA and KCPA. They also\n\nasserted claims for conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress and\n\nsought a declaratory judgment for an accounting. The district court granted\n\nAGF’s motion for summary judgment on the RESPA, accounting, and\n\nemotional-distress claims, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the KCPA and\n\nconversion claims. The jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs’ favor on the KCPA\n\nclaim and awarded $500 in damages. The jury found in AGF’s favor on the\n\nconversion claim.\n\n       After trial, the parties agreed to the district court’s request to work out the\n\nissue of attorney fees. After several months with no resolution, the district court\n\nentered the judgment for $500 in plaintiffs’ favor. Plaintiffs then filed a motion\n\nto amend the judgment to impose a $10,000 civil penalty under the KCPA and to\n\naward them attorney fees. The district court denied the request for a civil penalty\n\nand awarded plaintiffs $200 in attorney fees. Plaintiffs appeal, asserting that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment to AGF on their RESPA\n\n                                            -3-\n\fclaims, that a civil penalty under the KCPA was warranted, and that the\n\nattorney-fee award of $200 is inadequate.\n\n                                 Appeal No. 06-3086\n\n                       Summary Judgment on RESPA Claims\n\n      We first address plaintiffs’ appeal of the summary-judgment order on their\n\nRESPA claims. As relevant here, RESPA requires that upon the receipt of a\n\nqualified written request, the servicer of a federally related mortgage loan must\n\nacknowledge receipt of the correspondence within twenty days, excluding\n\nweekends and holidays, and within sixty working days, must make appropriate\n\ncorrections or investigate and provide the borrower with a written notification\n\nexplaining why the servicer believes the account is correct. 12 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2605(e)(1)(A) & (2); see also 24 C.F.R. § 3500.21(e). A “qualified written\n\nrequest” must be a written correspondence that “includes, or otherwise enables\n\nthe servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower; and includes a\n\nstatement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower . . . that the account is in\n\nerror or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information\n\nsought. . . .” § 2605(e)(1)(B). AGF does not dispute plaintiffs’ assertion that it is\n\na “servicer” of a “federally related mortgage loan,” as defined by RESPA.\n\n12 U.S.C. §§ 2605(i)(2) & 2602(1).\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment, viewing\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fMcGowan v. City of Eufala, 472 F.3d 736, 741 (10th Cir. 2006). Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that three letters sent to AGF by their attorney dated\n\nJune 28, 2002, September 26, 2002, and October 14, 2002, were qualified written\n\nrequests and that AGF’s treatment of those requests violated RESPA. 1 The\n\nJune 28 letter complained about collection procedures employed by AGF’s\n\npersonnel. It also contained the following pertinent language: “On May 21,\n\n2002, you refused to accept a payment on the vehicle and demanded the funds be\n\napplied to the house payment. I believe the law requires you to honor the\n\ndebtor’s directions on how their funds are to be applied.” Aplee. Supp. App.\n\n(appeal No. 06-3086), at 57. The district court held that the letter was not a\n\nqualified written request because it did not include the loan account numbers, did\n\nnot state that the account was in error, and did not request information from the\n\nlender.\n\n      “[W]e can affirm for any reason supported by the record but not relied on\n\nby the district court.” Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co., 287 F.3d 936, 950\n\n(10th Cir. 2002). We need not decide whether the June 28 letter was a qualified\n\n1\n      Plaintiffs have abandoned on appeal their claim that a July 1, 2002, letter\nsigned by plaintiffs themselves, rather than their attorney, was a qualified written\nrequest.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fwritten request because even if it was, we conclude that AGF responded to it as\n\nRESPA requires by sending a writing within 60 days explaining why it believed\n\nthe account was correct, and otherwise complying with RESPA. Aplee. Supp.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3086), at 59-60. Plaintiffs have made no showing that\n\nAGF’s response did not comply with RESPA.\n\n      As for the other two letters, plaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that they filed suit before the applicable time limits expired. On\n\nSeptember 28, 2002, within twenty working days, AGF acknowledged receipt of\n\nplaintiffs’ September 26 letter. Plaintiffs filed suit on November 4, 2002, before\n\nthe sixty-working-day deadline for a substantive response to the September 26\n\nletter. Similarly, suit was filed before the twenty-working-day deadline to\n\nacknowledge plaintiffs’ October 14 letter. Accordingly, these claims were not\n\nripe. See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (“A claim is not\n\nripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur\n\nas anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” (quotation omitted)). We affirm\n\nthe summary judgment on plaintiffs’ RESPA claims.\n\n                           Civil Penalty Under the KCPA\n\n      Plaintiffs also challenge the district court’s decision not to impose a civil\n\npenalty on AGF for its violation of the KCPA. “When exercising jurisdiction\n\nover pendent state claims, we must apply the substantive law of the forum state\n\nand reach the same decision we believe that state’s highest court would, just as\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwe would if our jurisdiction rested on diversity of citizenship.” Lytle v. City of\n\nHaysville, 138 F.3d 857, 868 (10th Cir. 1998). We review the district court’s\n\ndecision not to impose a civil penalty under the KCPA for an abuse of discretion.\n\nDodson v. U-Needa Self Storage, LLC, 96 P.3d 667, 673 (Kan. Ct. App. 2004).\n\n       The KCPA provides that “[a] consumer who is aggrieved by a violation of\n\n[the] act may recover . . . damages or a civil penalty as provided in [Kan. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 50-636(a)], whichever is greater.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-634(b). Section\n\n50-636(a) authorizes a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation.\n\nKan. Stat. Ann. § 50-636(a).\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the district court was required to choose an amount for\n\na penalty and then decide whether to order AGF to pay it. Relying on Bell v.\n\nKent-Brown Chevrolet Co., 561 P.2d 907, 911 (Kan. Ct. App. 1977), superseded\n\nby statute on other grounds, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-626, they assert that because a\n\nsuccessful consumer is to be awarded the greater amount of the penalty or the\n\ndamages award, the court is required to set a penalty amount. In a related\n\nargument, plaintiffs assert that even though section 50-634(b) provides that a\n\nconsumer may recover damages or a civil penalty, the legislative intent was to\n\nrequire the court to set a penalty amount. We are not persuaded. Neither the\n\nstatute nor Bell requires this and we see no indication that the Kansas legislature\n\nintended such a requirement or that the Kansas appellate courts would impose\n\none.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      Plaintiffs also contend that imposing a $10,000 civil penalty would serve\n\nthe KCPA’s purpose of “encourag[ing] aggrieved consumers with small claims to\n\nfile suit,” Equitable Life Leasing Corp. v. Abbick, 757 P.2d 304, 307 (Kan. 1988).\n\nThis may be so, but whether to impose a penalty and the amount are discretionary\n\nwith the court. Here, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion that the district court did not\n\nexercise its discretion at all, the court stated that it had reviewed its notes\n\nregarding the trial and its instructions to the jury, and was “satisfied that the jury\n\nadequately appraised defendant’s conduct as well as plaintiffs’ damages.” Aplt.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3086), at 80. The record on appeal does not include the jury\n\ninstructions or trial transcripts; therefore, we cannot review the district court’s\n\ndetermination that the jury adequately appraised the parties’ conduct. See Scott v.\n\nHern, 216 F.3d 897, 912 (10th Cir. 2000) (“Where the record is insufficient to\n\npermit review we must affirm.”). Moreover, plaintiffs do not argue that the jury’s\n\nconclusion was erroneous. Consequently, having reviewed the parties’\n\narguments, the applicable law, and the record provided, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in deciding against imposing a civil penalty\n\nunder the KCPA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f                     Appeal No. 06-3358 – Attorney Fee Award\n\n      In this appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court’s attorney-fee award of\n\n$200.00 on their KCPA claim. 2 Attorney fees may be awarded under the KCPA\n\n“if, inter alia, a supplier is found to have violated the act through judgment.”\n\nDodson, 96 P.3d at 673 (citing Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-634(e)). The district court\n\nnoted that plaintiffs were successful due to their attorney’s efforts on one minor\n\nKCPA claim, but their attorney did not segregate his time spent on the KCPA\n\nclaims from claims for which an attorney-fee award is not authorized. Therefore,\n\nthe court determined that an attorney fee of $200 was reasonable because it was\n\n“consistent with a contingent fee following a trial and successful recovery.” Aplt.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3358), at 73.\n\n      Plaintiffs argue that a $200 fee is patently unreasonable, considering their\n\ncounsel’s time spent preparing their case and conducting a two-day trial. They\n\nmaintain that it is unreasonable to expect their attorney to keep separate time\n\nrecords. In addition, they argue that their KCPA claims were inseparable from\n\n\n\n\n2\n       Plaintiffs’ attorney characterizes himself as the appellant in this appeal, but\nhe does not have standing to appeal the attorney-fee award. Weeks v. Indep. Sch.\nDist. No. I-89, 230 F.3d 1201, 1213 (10th Cir. 2000). We construe the\nattorney-fee appeal as part of the merits appeal brought by plaintiffs since they\nare parties to the appeal. Cf. Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight,\nInc., 9 F.3d 849, 854-55(10th Cir. 1993) (holding attorney lacked standing to\nchallenge amount of attorney fees awarded; plaintiffs not parties to the appeal).\nAccordingly, this court has jurisdiction.\n\n                                          -9-\n\ftheir conversion claims, so they were entitled to their requested fees for the\n\nclaims on which the case went to trial.\n\n      We apply an abuse-of-discretion standard of review to the district court’s\n\ndecision on attorney fees. Dodson, 96 P.3d at 673. “Where several causes of\n\naction are joined and only some of them permit the award of attorney fees, the\n\nwork on several causes must be segregated in determining an attorney fee award.”\n\nDeSpiegelaere v. Killion, 947 P.2d 1039, 1044 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997). If, however,\n\nthe KCPA claims are “inextricably intertwined” with other claims, the district\n\ncourt need not separate attorney fees for each claim. York v. Intrust Bank, N.A.,\n\n962 P.2d 405, 430 (Kan. 1998). But counsel assumes a risk if he does not\n\nsegregate his time, because “if [he has] made no attempt in [his] time records to\n\nsegregate [his] time as to different causes of action that are not mutual in their\n\nfacts and impossible of segregation, it could well be that a court could find a\n\nfailure of proof and award no attorney fees.” DeSpiegelaere, 947 P.2d at 1044-45.\n\n      Plaintiffs press for a rule requiring an award of a reasonable attorney fee in\n\nevery KCPA case in order to encourage attorneys to pursue KCPA claims. They\n\nrely on York, 962 P.2d at 430, for the proposition that segregation of time is not\n\nrequired. In York, the trial court based the attorney-fee award on an expert\n\nwitness’s review of the attorneys’ time entry logs to calculate how much time the\n\nattorneys spent prosecuting the KCPA claim. Id. Therefore, the attorney-fee\n\naward in York was based on the time spent on the KCPA claim, even though the\n\n                                          -10-\n\fcourt found that the KCPA claim was inextricably intertwined with other claims.\n\nSee id. Plaintiffs have not cited any legal authority authorizing a departure from\n\nestablished Kansas law requiring attorneys to segregate their time. DeSpiegelaere,\n\n947 P.2d at 1044.\n\n      Next, although plaintiffs do not argue that their attorney segregated his time\n\nrecords, they contend that their KCPA claims were inextricably intertwined with\n\ntheir conversion claim. 3 The conversion claim concerned the disability insurance\n\nproceeds, while the successful KCPA claim was based on how plaintiffs’ payments\n\nwere applied to the two loan accounts. We conclude that plaintiffs have not\n\ndemonstrated that the two types of claims were inextricably intertwined to warrant\n\nan award of attorney fees on the conversion claim. Based on this record, we find\n\nno abuse of discretion in the district court’s attorney-fee award.\n\n\n\n\n3\n       Plaintiffs do not argue that their KCPA claims were inextricably\nintertwined with their other claims, including those for a declaratory judgment for\nan accounting, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and RESPA violations.\nAlthough not made clear on appeal, we assume plaintiffs are requesting only\nthose fees generated on the KCPA and conversion claims, as discussed in their\nattorney’s offer of proof to the district court to support an allowance of attorney\nfees.

(AGF) on their claims brought under the Real Estate Settlement\n\nProcedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2617. They also appeal the order\n\ndenying their request for a statutory penalty, as authorized by the Kansas\n\nConsumer Protection Act (KCPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-636(a). In the related\n\nappeal, plaintiffs challenge the amount of attorney fees awarded to their counsel.\n\nWe exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      We provide only a brief outline of the facts to explain the issues presented\n\nfor review. Plaintiffs financed their home and automobile through loans with\n\nAGF in two separate accounts. One of the accounts carried disability insurance.\n\nPlaintiffs directed the proceeds from the disability policy to be paid to AGF to\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties’ request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fbring both accounts current, and the rest to be paid to them. Instead, AGF\n\nretained all of the proceeds and applied them to the loans. During 2002, plaintiffs\n\ndirected various payments to one or the other of the loans, but AGF did not\n\nalways apply the payments as directed. Plaintiffs and their attorney sent at least\n\nfour letters to AGF concerning the payment directions. AGF responded to all but\n\nthe last letter, but did not adjust the loans to plaintiffs’ satisfaction.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed suit alleging AGF violated RESPA and KCPA. They also\n\nasserted claims for conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress and\n\nsought a declaratory judgment for an accounting. The district court granted\n\nAGF’s motion for summary judgment on the RESPA, accounting, and\n\nemotional-distress claims, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the KCPA and\n\nconversion claims. The jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs’ favor on the KCPA\n\nclaim and awarded $500 in damages. The jury found in AGF’s favor on the\n\nconversion claim.\n\n       After trial, the parties agreed to the district court’s request to work out the\n\nissue of attorney fees. After several months with no resolution, the district court\n\nentered the judgment for $500 in plaintiffs’ favor. Plaintiffs then filed a motion\n\nto amend the judgment to impose a $10,000 civil penalty under the KCPA and to\n\naward them attorney fees. The district court denied the request for a civil penalty\n\nand awarded plaintiffs $200 in attorney fees. Plaintiffs appeal, asserting that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment to AGF on their RESPA\n\n                                            -3-\n\fclaims, that a civil penalty under the KCPA was warranted, and that the\n\nattorney-fee award of $200 is inadequate.\n\n                                 Appeal No. 06-3086\n\n                       Summary Judgment on RESPA Claims\n\n      We first address plaintiffs’ appeal of the summary-judgment order on their\n\nRESPA claims. As relevant here, RESPA requires that upon the receipt of a\n\nqualified written request, the servicer of a federally related mortgage loan must\n\nacknowledge receipt of the correspondence within twenty days, excluding\n\nweekends and holidays, and within sixty working days, must make appropriate\n\ncorrections or investigate and provide the borrower with a written notification\n\nexplaining why the servicer believes the account is correct. 12 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2605(e)(1)(A) & (2); see also 24 C.F.R. § 3500.21(e). A “qualified written\n\nrequest” must be a written correspondence that “includes, or otherwise enables\n\nthe servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower; and includes a\n\nstatement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower . . . that the account is in\n\nerror or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information\n\nsought. . . .” § 2605(e)(1)(B). AGF does not dispute plaintiffs’ assertion that it is\n\na “servicer” of a “federally related mortgage loan,” as defined by RESPA.\n\n12 U.S.C. §§ 2605(i)(2) & 2602(1).\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment, viewing\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fMcGowan v.

It also contained the following pertinent language: “On May 21,\n\n2002, you refused to accept a payment on the vehicle and demanded the funds be\n\napplied to the house payment. I believe the law requires you to honor the\n\ndebtor’s directions on how their funds are to be applied.” Aplee. Supp. App.\n\n(appeal No. 06-3086), at 57. The district court held that the letter was not a\n\nqualified written request because it did not include the loan account numbers, did\n\nnot state that the account was in error, and did not request information from the\n\nlender.\n\n      “[W]e can affirm for any reason supported by the record but not relied on\n\nby the district court.” Jacobsen v.

Aplee. Supp.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3086), at 59-60. Plaintiffs have made no showing that\n\nAGF’s response did not comply with RESPA.\n\n      As for the other two letters, plaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that they filed suit before the applicable time limits expired. On\n\nSeptember 28, 2002, within twenty working days, AGF acknowledged receipt of\n\nplaintiffs’ September 26 letter. Plaintiffs filed suit on November 4, 2002, before\n\nthe sixty-working-day deadline for a substantive response to the September 26\n\nletter. Similarly, suit was filed before the twenty-working-day deadline to\n\nacknowledge plaintiffs’ October 14 letter. Accordingly, these claims were not\n\nripe. See, e.g., Texas v.

In a related\n\nargument, plaintiffs assert that even though section 50-634(b) provides that a\n\nconsumer may recover damages or a civil penalty, the legislative intent was to\n\nrequire the court to set a penalty amount. We are not persuaded. Neither the\n\nstatute nor Bell requires this and we see no indication that the Kansas legislature\n\nintended such a requirement or that the Kansas appellate courts would impose\n\none.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      Plaintiffs also contend that imposing a $10,000 civil penalty would serve\n\nthe KCPA’s purpose of “encourag[ing] aggrieved consumers with small claims to\n\nfile suit,” Equitable Life Leasing Corp. v.

Here, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion that the district court did not\n\nexercise its discretion at all, the court stated that it had reviewed its notes\n\nregarding the trial and its instructions to the jury, and was “satisfied that the jury\n\nadequately appraised defendant’s conduct as well as plaintiffs’ damages.” Aplt.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3086), at 80. The record on appeal does not include the jury\n\ninstructions or trial transcripts; therefore, we cannot review the district court’s\n\ndetermination that the jury adequately appraised the parties’ conduct. See Scott v.\n\nHern, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769208\"><a href=\"/opinion/769208/american-civil-liberties-union-foundation-of-colorado-inc-amicus-curiae/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 912 (10th Cir. 2000) (“Where the record is insufficient to\n\npermit review we must affirm.”). Moreover, plaintiffs do not argue that the jury’s\n\nconclusion was erroneous. Consequently, having reviewed the parties’\n\narguments, the applicable law, and the record provided, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in deciding against imposing a civil penalty\n\nunder the KCPA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f                     Appeal No. 06-3358 – Attorney Fee Award\n\n      In this appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court’s attorney-fee award of\n\n$200.00 on their KCPA claim. 2 Attorney fees may be awarded under the KCPA\n\n“if, inter alia, a supplier is found to have violated the act through judgment.”\n\nDodson, 96 P.3d at 673 (citing Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-634(e)). The district court\n\nnoted that plaintiffs were successful due to their attorney’s efforts on one minor\n\nKCPA claim, but their attorney did not segregate his time spent on the KCPA\n\nclaims from claims for which an attorney-fee award is not authorized. Therefore,\n\nthe court determined that an attorney fee of $200 was reasonable because it was\n\n“consistent with a contingent fee following a trial and successful recovery.” Aplt.\n\nApp. (appeal No. 06-3358), at 73.\n\n      Plaintiffs argue that a $200 fee is patently unreasonable, considering their\n\ncounsel’s time spent preparing their case and conducting a two-day trial. They\n\nmaintain that it is unreasonable to expect their attorney to keep separate time\n\nrecords. In addition, they argue that their KCPA claims were inseparable from\n\n\n\n\n2\n       Plaintiffs’ attorney characterizes himself as the appellant in this appeal, but\nhe does not have standing to appeal the attorney-fee award.

But counsel assumes a risk if he does not\n\nsegregate his time, because “if [he has] made no attempt in [his] time records to\n\nsegregate [his] time as to different causes of action that are not mutual in their\n\nfacts and impossible of segregation, it could well be that a court could find a\n\nfailure of proof and award no attorney fees.” DeSpiegelaere, 947 P.2d at 1044-45.\n\n      Plaintiffs press for a rule requiring an award of a reasonable attorney fee in\n\nevery KCPA case in order to encourage attorneys to pursue KCPA claims. They\n\nrely on York, 962 P.2d at 430, for the proposition that segregation of time is not\n\nrequired. In York, the trial court based the attorney-fee award on an expert\n\nwitness’s review of the attorneys’ time entry logs to calculate how much time the\n\nattorneys spent prosecuting the KCPA claim. Id. Therefore, the attorney-fee\n\naward in York was based on the time spent on the KCPA claim, even though the\n\n                                          -10-\n\fcourt found that the KCPA claim was inextricably intertwined with other claims.\n\nSee id. Plaintiffs have not cited any legal authority authorizing a departure from\n\nestablished Kansas law requiring attorneys to segregate their time. DeSpiegelaere,\n\n947 P.2d at 1044.\n\n      Next, although plaintiffs do not argue that their attorney segregated his time\n\nrecords, they contend that their KCPA claims were inextricably intertwined with\n\ntheir conversion claim. 3 The conversion claim concerned the disability insurance\n\nproceeds, while the successful KCPA claim was based on how plaintiffs’ payments\n\nwere applied to the two loan accounts. We conclude that plaintiffs have not\n\ndemonstrated that the two types of claims were inextricably intertwined to warrant\n\nan award of attorney fees on the conversion claim. Based on this record, we find\n\nno abuse of discretion in the district court’s attorney-fee award.\n\n\n\n\n3\n       Plaintiffs do not argue that their KCPA claims were inextricably\nintertwined with their other claims, including those for a declaratory judgment for\nan accounting, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and RESPA violations.\nAlthough not made clear on appeal, we assume plaintiffs are requesting only\nthose fees generated on the KCPA and conversion claims, as discussed in their\nattorney’s offer of proof to the district court to support an allowance of attorney\nfees.
