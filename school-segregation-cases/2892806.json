Bilello contends the Omaha area located east of 42nd Street is racially\n\fmixed and economically distressed. The district court1 dismissed the claims, without\nprejudice, for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Bilello appeals.\nWe generally affirm.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n      Bilello is an Iowa resident employed by Service One, which provides in-home\nappliance repairs. Bilello works in residences located in the north and south sections\nof Omaha, which, Bilello alleges, are “racially mixed and economically distressed.”\nKum & Go is a limited liability company doing business in Omaha, and is owned by\nKrause Gentle Corporation. Kum & Go stores are located throughout Omaha and sell\ngasoline, ready-to-eat foods, and sundries.\n\n         Bilello alleges Kum & Go engages in a discriminatory “practice and policy\n. . . [of] provid[ing] restroom facilities to their customers outside the North and South\nOmaha areas and [of] refus[ing] restroom services to their customers, including\n[Bilello], east of 42nd Street, Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska.” On multiple\noccasions, Bilello purchased goods at Kum & Go stores located east of 42nd Street,\nbut store employees repeatedly refused Bilello access to restroom facilities, causing\nhim discomfort, inconvenience, and embarrassment. Bilello alleges the patron\nrestroom practice and policy at Kum & Go stores located east of 42nd Street\nconstitute willful violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a(a) and 1981.2 Bilello seeks\ninjunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorney\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Nebraska.\n      2\n       In his original complaint Bilello alleged Kum & Go was in willful violation\nof Omaha Municipal Code § 49-492 (Code). Because Bilello did not allege the Code\nprovides any civil remedies or private right of action, the district court dismissed the\nclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Bilello did not re-\nplead the alleged Code violation claim in his First Amended Complaint.\n                                           2\n\ffees. Kum & Go filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted for failure\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n\n      On appeal, Bilello argues the district court erred in ruling he (1) did not have\nstanding to raise issues of racial discrimination directed against unidentified residents\nof north and south Omaha; and (2) failed to state causes of action under 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000(a) and 1981.\n\nII.     DISCUSSION\n       A.     42 U.S.C. § 2000a\n       By its plain language, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(c) requires notice to the state or\nlocal authority as a prerequisite to filing a civil action when a state or local law\nprohibits discrimination in public accommodations and provides a remedy for such\npractice. Subsection (c) proscribes a civil action may not be brought under section\n2000a-3(a) “before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged\nact or practice has been given to the appropriate State or local authority by registered\nmail or in person.” Id.\n\n       Nebraska has enacted laws prohibiting discriminatory public accommodation\npractices and has conferred authority on an administrative agency to investigate,\nresolve, and, when necessary, redress discriminatory practices. Nebraska law\nguarantees “[a]ll persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and equal\nenjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in sections 20-132 to\n20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the grounds of race, color, sex,\nreligion, national origin, or ancestry.” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 20-132 (Reissue 1991).\nSection 20-139 directs that sections 20-132 to 20-143 “shall be administered by the\n[Nebraska] Equal Opportunity Commission” (Commission) and further provides that\ncounty attorneys are authorized to enforce these statutory sections and “possess the\nsame powers and duties” as the Commission. Id. § 20-139 (Supp. 2002).\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       At least two federal circuit courts have ruled that when a state has enacted laws\nto protect against discriminatory public accommodation practices, a Title II plaintiff\nmust establish he has satisfied the procedural prerequisites of section 2000a-3(c)\nbefore filing a civil action in federal court. See Stearnes v. Baur’s Opera House, Inc.,\n3 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (7th Cir. 1993) (Illinois law); Harris v. Ericson, 457 F.2d 765,\n766 (10th Cir. 1972) (New Mexico law). Although Bilello apparently attempted to\ncomply with the procedural requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(c) by filing written\nnotice of the alleged discriminatory practice with the City of Omaha’s Human\nRelations Director, Nebraska law expressly declares the laws guaranteeing full and\nequal enjoyment to public accommodation shall be administered by the Commission.3\nSee Neb. Rev. Stat. § 20-139 (Supp. 2002).\n\n      Since the requirements of section 2000a-3(c) are jurisdictional, we join the\nSeventh and Tenth Circuits in holding these procedural prerequisites must be satisfied\nbefore we have jurisdiction over a section 2000a claim. See Stearnes, 3 F.3d at 1144;\nHarris, 457 F.2d at 767. We recognize the issue of jurisdiction was not raised below\nby the parties or the district court. However, when the record indicates jurisdiction\nmay be lacking, we must consider the jurisdictional issue sua sponte. See GMAC\nCommercial Credit LLC v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., 357 F.3d 827, 828 (8th Cir.\n2004) (explaining “[a]ny party or the court may, at any time, raise the issue of subject\nmatter jurisdiction”); Thomas v. Basham, 931 F.2d 521, 522-23 (8th Cir. 1991)\n(clarifying that federal courts have limited jurisdiction, and “every federal appellate\ncourt has a special obligation to consider its own jurisdiction” and raise sua sponte\njurisdictional issues “when there is an indication that jurisdiction is lacking, even if\nthe parties concede the issue”). Because the record establishes Bilello failed to notify\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       The record contains no indication the City of Omaha’s Human Relations\nDirector forwarded Bilello’s complaint to either the Commission or the Douglas\nCounty Attorney.\n                                           4\n\fthe Commission of the alleged discriminatory public accommodation practice and\npolicy, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court’s dismissal of the 2000a claim.\n\n\n\n        B.     42 U.S.C. § 1981\n        Bilello also contends Kum & Go’s alleged discriminatory public\naccommodation practice constitutes a willful violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which,\nin relevant part, provides:\n\n        All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\nright in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\nevidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security\nof persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\npunishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no\nother.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). Bilello claims Kum & Go’s refusal to allow patrons\naccess to restroom facilities at stores located east of 42nd Street is founded in race\ndiscrimination and denies him the full and equal benefit of the laws. Kum & Go\nargues Bilello, a Caucasian, lacks standing to bring such a claim.\n\n        The vast majority of cases filed pursuant to section 1981 allege intentional\ndiscriminatory conduct prompted by a hostile animus towards the plaintiff’s race. On\noccasion, courts have permitted cases to proceed where a plaintiff alleges a\ndiscriminatory practice was motivated by a hostile animus to another person’s or\ngroup’s race. Typically, courts have limited these third-party standing cases to\nsituations in which the plaintiff is the direct target of discrimination. See Des Vergnes\nv. Seekonk Water Dist., 601 F.2d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1979) (concluding section 1981\nconfers an “implied Right of action against any other person who, with a racially\ndiscriminatory intent, interferes with [the plaintiff’s] right to make contracts with non-\nwhites”; the statute also confers “an implied Right of action against any other person\n\n\n                                            5\n\fwho, with a racially discriminatory intent, injures [the plaintiff] because he made\ncontracts with non-whites”); see also Winston v. Lear-Siegler, Inc., 558 F.2d 1266,\n1270 (6th Cir. 1977); cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237 (1969)\n(reaching parallel result under § 1982). The D.C. Circuit has declared that implicit in\nthese cases, cited infra, “is a cause of action protecting people from private retaliation\nfor refusing to violate other people’s rights under § 1981, or for exercising their own\n§ 1981 rights.” Fair Employment Council of Greater Wash., Inc. v. BMC Mktg. Corp.,\n28 F.3d 1268, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n        Third-party standing for section 1981 claims is also permitted in cases\ninvolving discriminatory action taken directly against a non-minority person because\nof the person’s relationship to, association with, or advocacy of minorities. See\nClayton v. White Hall Sch. Dist., 875 F.2d 676, 678-80 (8th Cir. 1989) (concluding\nwhite employee had standing under section 1981 to raise issue of racial discrimination\ndirected against minority co-worker); Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262,\n1266-67 (10th Cir. 1989) (concluding white attorney had standing under section 1981\nto sue newspaper publishing allegedly false articles because attorney represented\nminority clients); Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111, 114-15 (5th Cir.\n1986) (permitting section 1981 suit by white plaintiff terminated because of marriage\nto minority spouse); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d 888, 890\n(11th Cir.1986) (same); Fiedler v. Marumsco Christian Sch., 631 F.2d 1144, 1150 (4th\nCir. 1980) (concluding white father and two white daughters had standing under\nsection 1981 to file suit against private sectarian school for terminating contractual\nrelationship with white daughters because of one daughter’s association with black\nstudent at school); DeMatteis v. Eastman Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 312, modified on\nreh’g, 520 F.2d 409 (2d Cir. 1975) (allowing suit under section 1981 where white\nemployee claimed his company forced him to retire because he sold his house to a\nfellow black employee).\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f        Assuming, without deciding, these standing principles enunciated in section\n1981 right-to-contract cases apply equally to section 1981 equal benefit cases, these\nstanding principles are simply not implicated in this case. Here, the challenged\npractice and policy of refusing patrons access to restroom facilities was not\nspecifically targeted at Bilello, nor has Bilello alleged he was refused access to\nrestroom facilities because of his close relationship to, association with, or advocacy\nof minorities. Nor has Bilello alleged “some hindrance to the third party’s ability to\nprotect his or her own interests.” Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991). If\nminority individuals patronizing Kum & Go stores located east of 42nd Street are\nbeing refused access to restroom facilities, then those individuals or persons related\nto or associated with them may file a section 1981 action. Because Bilello has not met\nthe minimum requisites for third-party standing, we conclude the district court\nproperly dismissed his section 1981 claim.\n\n       Finally, with regard to section 1981’s right to “the full and equal benefit of all\nlaws,” we have recognized that “[b]ecause the state is the sole source of the law, it is\nonly the state that can deny the full and equal benefit of the law.” Youngblood v.\nHy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., 266 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir. 2001) (quoting Chapman v.\nHigbee Co., 256 F.3d 416, 421 (6th Cir. 2001), rev’d en banc, 319 F.3d 825 (6th Cir.\n2003)).4 As such, we have held “[u]nder the Full-and-Equal Benefit clause [of 42\n\n\n       4\n        The Sixth Circuit granted rehearing en banc in Chapman and reversed the\npanel decision, with a majority holding “section 1981 plainly protects against\nimpairment of its equal benefit clause by private discrimination.” Chapman, 319 F.3d\nat 833, petition for cert. filed, 71 U.S.L.W. 3725 (U.S. May 06, 2003) (No. 02-1646).\nThe Second Circuit, while “assuming that Section 1981 requires a nexus to state\nproceedings or laws,” also held “the equal benefit clause of Section 1981(a) does not\nrequire state action.” Phillip v. Univ. of Rochester, 316 F.3d 291, 298-99 (2d Cir.\n2003). Under Eighth Circuit practice, we are bound to follow our precedents in\nYoungblood and a subsequently decided case, Bediako v. Stein Mart, Inc., 354 F.3d\n835 (8th Cir. 2004). Even if this circuit, sitting en banc, were to reverse its prior\nholdings requiring state action for claims brought pursuant to section 1981’s equal\n                                           7\n\fU.S.C. § 1981 a plaintiff must] allege that some sort of state action contributed to [the\nplaintiff’s] being discriminated against.” Bediako v. Stein Mart, Inc., 354 F.3d 835,\n838 n.3 (8th Cir. 2004) (citing Youngblood, 266 F.3d at 855). Bilello has not alleged\nstate action caused him to be denied the full and equal benefit of the laws; nor has\nBilello alleged the government was in a position of interdependence with Kum & Go\nor was so connected with the actions of the Kum & Go store managers and employees,\nthat the alleged discriminatory practice may be attributed to the state. Therefore,\nBilello’s section 1981 equal benefit claim fails as a matter of law. See Youngblood,\n266 F.3d at 855.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n      We affirm the dismissal, without prejudice, of Bilello’s section 2000a claim for\nlack of jurisdiction, and we dismiss, with prejudice, Bilello’s section 1981 equal\nbenefit claim for want of standing and for failure to allege state action.\n                         ___________________________\n\n\n\n\nbenefit clause, we believe the facts alleged by Bilello do not support a viable section\n1981 equal benefit claim under the standards articulated by the Sixth and Second\nCircuits. See Chapman, 319 F.3d at 832 (declaring “[a] litigant must demonstrate the\ndenial of the benefit of a law or proceeding protecting his . . . personal security or a\ncognizable property right”); Phillip, 316 F.3d at 298 (declaring “[p]rospective\nplaintiffs . . . must identify a relevant law or proceeding for the ‘security of persons\nand property’”) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a)).\n                                           8\n\f",

DISCUSSION\n       A.     42 U.S.C. § 2000a\n       By its plain language, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(c) requires notice to the state or\nlocal authority as a prerequisite to filing a civil action when a state or local law\nprohibits discrimination in public accommodations and provides a remedy for such\npractice. Subsection (c) proscribes a civil action may not be brought under section\n2000a-3(a) “before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged\nact or practice has been given to the appropriate State or local authority by registered\nmail or in person.” Id.\n\n       Nebraska has enacted laws prohibiting discriminatory public accommodation\npractices and has conferred authority on an administrative agency to investigate,\nresolve, and, when necessary, redress discriminatory practices. Nebraska law\nguarantees “[a]ll persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and equal\nenjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in sections 20-132 to\n20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the grounds of race, color, sex,\nreligion, national origin, or ancestry.” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 20-132 (Reissue 1991).\nSection 20-139 directs that sections 20-132 to 20-143 “shall be administered by the\n[Nebraska] Equal Opportunity Commission” (Commission) and further provides that\ncounty attorneys are authorized to enforce these statutory sections and “possess the\nsame powers and duties” as the Commission. Id. § 20-139 (Supp. 2002).\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       At least two federal circuit courts have ruled that when a state has enacted laws\nto protect against discriminatory public accommodation practices, a Title II plaintiff\nmust establish he has satisfied the procedural prerequisites of section 2000a-3(c)\nbefore filing a civil action in federal court.

Baur’s Opera House, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629037\"><a href=\"/opinion/629037/mark-w-stearnes-v-baurs-opera-house-incorporated-doing-business-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144-45 (7th Cir. 1993) (Illinois law); Harris v.

Although Bilello apparently attempted to\ncomply with the procedural requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(c) by filing written\nnotice of the alleged discriminatory practice with the City of Omaha’s Human\nRelations Director, Nebraska law expressly declares the laws guaranteeing full and\nequal enjoyment to public accommodation shall be administered by the Commission.3\nSee Neb. Rev. Stat. § 20-139 (Supp. 2002).\n\n      Since the requirements of section 2000a-3(c) are jurisdictional, we join the\nSeventh and Tenth Circuits in holding these procedural prerequisites must be satisfied\nbefore we have jurisdiction over a section 2000a claim. See Stearnes, 3 F.3d at 1144;\nHarris, 457 F.2d at 767. We recognize the issue of jurisdiction was not raised below\nby the parties or the district court.

Because the record establishes Bilello failed to notify\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       The record contains no indication the City of Omaha’s Human Relations\nDirector forwarded Bilello’s complaint to either the Commission or the Douglas\nCounty Attorney.\n                                           4\n\fthe Commission of the alleged discriminatory public accommodation practice and\npolicy, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court’s dismissal of the 2000a claim.\n\n\n\n        B.     42 U.S.C. § 1981\n        Bilello also contends Kum & Go’s alleged discriminatory public\naccommodation practice constitutes a willful violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which,\nin relevant part, provides:\n\n        All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\nright in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\nevidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security\nof persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\npunishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no\nother.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). Bilello claims Kum & Go’s refusal to allow patrons\naccess to restroom facilities at stores located east of 42nd Street is founded in race\ndiscrimination and denies him the full and equal benefit of the laws. Kum & Go\nargues Bilello, a Caucasian, lacks standing to bring such a claim.\n\n        The vast majority of cases filed pursuant to section 1981 allege intentional\ndiscriminatory conduct prompted by a hostile animus towards the plaintiff’s race. On\noccasion, courts have permitted cases to proceed where a plaintiff alleges a\ndiscriminatory practice was motivated by a hostile animus to another person’s or\ngroup’s race. Typically, courts have limited these third-party standing cases to\nsituations in which the plaintiff is the direct target of discrimination. See Des Vergnes\nv.

Here, the challenged\npractice and policy of refusing patrons access to restroom facilities was not\nspecifically targeted at Bilello, nor has Bilello alleged he was refused access to\nrestroom facilities because of his close relationship to, association with, or advocacy\nof minorities. Nor has Bilello alleged “some hindrance to the third party’s ability to\nprotect his or her own interests.” Powers v.
