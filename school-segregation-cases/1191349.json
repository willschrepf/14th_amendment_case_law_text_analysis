Flippin, Assistant Attorney General for Appellee, Ross Bates and Paul Barrett\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n         Sherman Alexander Henderson (“Appellant”) is an inmate in the custody of the Tennessee\nDepartment of Correction (the “TDOC”). Ross Bates is an Associate Warden with the TDOC. Paul\nBarrett (together with Ross Bates, “Appellees”) is a Pre-Release Counselor with the TDOC. On\nNovember 30, 2004, Mr. Henderson filed a “Complaint for Violation of Civil Rights Under Title 42\nUSC §1983\" (the “Complaint”) against Messrs. Bates and Barrett. In his Complaint, Mr. Henderson\nasserts that Messrs. Bates and Barrett conspired to deprive Mr. Henderson of his constitutional right\nto equal protection under the law. Specifically, Mr. Henderson asserts that Messrs. Bates and Barrett\nwillfully and maliciously discriminated against Mr. Henderson by changing his custody status on\nDecember 30, 2003. Mr. Henderson alleges that he was treated differently than similarly situated\ninmates and that this differential treatment violated his right to equal protection under the law.\n\f        On May 25, 2005, Messrs. Bates and Barrett filed a “Motion to Dismiss” (the “Motion”),\nalong with a Memorandum of Law in support thereof. In their Motion, Messrs. Bates and Barrett\nassert that they have “absolute immunity from suit as [] state employee[s] and sovereign immunity\nas [] officer[s] of the State.” Further, the Motion states that:\n\n               ...Mr. Henderson fails to state an equal protection claim. An inmate\n               has no constitutional right to avoid administrative segregation,\n               placement in a particular unit of the prison, or a particular security\n               classification. As Mr. Henderson fails to allege a fundamental\n               constitutional right or liberty interest at stake, he fails to state an\n               equal protection claim. Additionally, Mr. Henderson has not alleged\n               that he was discriminated against based on a suspect classification.\n               His movement and change in custody status was rationally related to\n               penological interests.\n\nBy Order of May 26, 2005, the trial court granted the Motion to Dismiss and adopted the legal\nanalysis set out in the Memorandum of Law.\n\n       Mr. Henderson appeals, pro se, and raises three issues for review as stated in his brief:\n\n               1. Did the Circuit Trial Court err when it deemed defendants’ were\n               absolutely immune from this §1983 action?\n\n               2. Did the Circuit Trial Court err when it dismissed plaintiff’s civil\n               right action before he could conduct civil discovery?\n\n               3. Did the Circuit Trial Court err in not determining whether\n               plaintiff[’s] agreement in signing Form CR-0996 “Department of\n               Correction Assignment of Responsibility” form that he entered\n               constituted a conditional contract in his Minimum Direct, Trusty\n               custody and annex placement, so long as he maintain[ed] good\n               behavior while housed at an annex?\n\n        We perceive the sole issue to be whether the trial court erred in dismissing Mr. Henderson’s\nComplaint for failure to state an equal protection claim. It is well settled in Tennessee that a motion\nto dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted tests the legal\nsufficiency of the complaint. It admits the truth of all relevant and material allegations but asserts\nthat such allegations do not constitute a cause of action as a matter of law. See Riggs v. Burson, 941\nS.W.2d 44 (Tenn. 1997). Obviously, when considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted, we are limited to the examination of the complaint alone.\nSee Wolcotts Fin. Serv., Inc. v. McReynolds, 807 S.W.2d 708 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990). The basis for\nthe motion is that the allegations in the complaint considered alone and taken as true are insufficient\nto state a claim as a matter of law. See Cornpropst v. Sloan, 528 S.W.2d 188 (Tenn. 1975). In\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fconsidering such a motion, the court should construe the complaint liberally in favor of the plaintiff,\ntaking all the allegations of fact therein as true. See Cook Uithoven v. Spinnaker’s of Rivergate,\nInc., 878 S.W.2d 934 (Tenn. 1994).\n\nEqual Protection Claim\n\n        The Supreme Court of Tennessee has stated that the Tennessee Constitution's equal\nprotection provisions confer \"essentially the same protection\" as the equal protection clause of the\nUnited States Constitution. Tennessee Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 851 S.W.2d 139, 152\n(Tenn.1993). Equal protection requires that persons similarly situated be treated the same under the\nlaw, or that the state treat persons under like circumstances and conditions the same. Genesco, Inc.\nv. Woods, 578 S.W.2d 639, 641 (Tenn.1979), superseded on other grounds by Combustion Eng'g,\nInc. v. Jackson, 705 S.W.2d 655 (Tenn.1986); Jaami v. Conley, 958 S.W.2d 123, 126\n(Tenn.Ct.App.1997). Nevertheless, \"[t]he Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal laws, not equal\nresults.\" Personnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293, 60 L.Ed.2d\n870 (1979), aff'd, Feeney v. Personnel Adm'r of Mass., 445 U.S. 901, 100 S.Ct. 1075, 63 L.Ed.2d\n317 (1980).\n\n        Equal protection challenges are based upon governmental classifications. The classic analysis\nfor such challenges involves the application of differing standards depending upon the effect. That\nanalysis requires strict scrutiny only when the classification interferes with a fundamental right or\noperates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class. State v. Tester, 879 S.W.2d 823, 828\n(Tenn.1994). The standard of reduced scrutiny applies in other situations requiring only that a\nrational basis exist for the classification, or that the classification have a reasonable relationship to\na legitimate state interest. Id. Unless a suspect classification or denial of a fundamental right to a\nparticular class is involved, equal protection attacks on prison regulations are analyzed to determine\nwhether distinctions between groups have a rational basis, or, more particularly, whether they are\nreasonably related to penological interests. Lee v. Young, No. 99-6012, 2002 WL 1781335 (6th Cir.\nNov. 6, 2000) (citing Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867, 877 (7th Cir.1988)).\n\n        It is well settled that prisoners do not have the constitutional right to be incarcerated in any\nparticular institution. See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532 (1976). The United\nStates Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the ability to transfer prisoners is essential to prison\nmanagement, and that requiring hearings for such transfers would impermissibly interfere with\nprison administration. See, e.g., Ward v. Dyke, 58 F.3d 271 at 274 (citing Meachum v. Fano, 427\nU.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976); Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 103 S.Ct.\n1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466\n(1976)). “Whatever expectation the prisoner may have in remaining at a particular prison so long\nas he behaves himself, it is ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger procedural due process protections\nas long as prison officials have discretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for no reason at all.\"\nWard v. Dyke, 58 F.3d 271 (citing Meachum v. Fano, 42 U.S. at 228, 96 Sup.Ct. at 2540).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f        Absent an allegation of interference with a fundamental right or discriminatory treatment\nbased on suspect classification, a plaintiff cannot maintain an equal protection claim because he or\nshe was treated differently from others alleged to be similarly situated. Booher v. U.S. Postal Serv.,\n843 F.2d 943, 944 (6th Cir.1988). In Booher, a discharged probationary employee alleged that he\nwas \"singled out\" for discharge and other probationary employees with worse attendance records\nwere not discharged. Id. The Sixth Circuit noted that Booher sought to make out a violation of equal\nprotection by claiming he was treated differently from other similarly situated employees. The Court\nconcluded that Booher’s claim ultimately failed because there was no claim that Booher was\nvictimized because of some suspect classification, which is an essential element of an equal\nprotection claim, and that, even assuming there was an unjustified action taken against Booher, this\nsingle action, without more, cannot form the basis of an equal protection claim. Id. The Booher\nCourt reiterated that the equal protection concept does not create a classification of persons who\nreceived better treatment. Id. In other words, an equal protection claim does not arise simply because\nof differing treatment.\n\n        This reasoning has been applied in the context of a prisoner challenging his reclassification\nand transfer by prison officials. Newell v. Brown, 981 F.2d 880 (6th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S.\n842, 114 S.Ct. 127, 126 L.Ed.2d 91 (1993). After first determining that the prisoner did not have a\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest, the court held that \"the plaintiff could not make out a\nviolation of his equal protection rights simply by showing that other inmates were treated\ndifferently.\" Id. Relying upon Booher, the Newell Court held that the prisoner would have to show\nhe was reclassified because of some suspect classification. Id. Similarly, a prisoner alleging\nselective enforcement of a prison regulation cannot sustain an equal protection claim absent an\nassertion and a showing of some purposeful discrimination. Fletcher v. Chartrand, 869 F.2d 1490\n(6th Cir.1989) (citing McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 109 S.Ct. 1756 (1987)).\n\n        In the instant case, not only does Mr. Henderson not have a constitutional right to a particular\nplacement in the prison system, but he also has not alleged that he was treated more harshly than\nothers because he is a member of a suspect class. Mr. Henderson only alleges that he was “singled\nout and victimized because of his classification within his group of prisoners convicted of first\ndegree murder.” First degree murderers are not protected as a suspect class. Consequently, there\nneed only be a rationale basis for Mr. Henderson’s custody status being changed that is reasonably\nrelated to a penological interest. Lee v. Young, No. 99-6012, 2002 WL 1781335 (6th Cir. Nov. 6,\n2000) (citing Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867, 877 (7th Cir.1988)).\n\n         The TDOC is vested with wide discretion in the management and supervision of penal\ninstitutions. See T.C.A. §4-6-102 (2005). Mr. Henderson asserts that he was moved “to a more\nsecure housing unit...due to the parole board having declined plaintiff for seven (7) years[.]”\nConsidering the effect of a decline of parole on a prisoner’s propensity to escape or to act out\ninappropriately, movement to a more secure housing unit or a change in custody status of the inmate\nwould certainly be rational under the circumstances and would serve the legitimate penological\ninterest of maintaining security and order. Consequently, and for the foregoing reasons, we find that\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fthe trial court did not err in finding that Mr. Henderson fails to state a claim for violation of his right\nto equal protection.\n\n        Having concluded that the trial court properly dismissed Mr. Henderson’s claim on the basis\nthat Mr. Henderson failed to state a cause of action for equal protection violation, we also conclude\nthat the trial court did not err in suspending discovery and/or in granting the Motion to Dismiss\nbefore Mr. Henderson was allowed to respond to same. As discussed above, a Tenn R. Civ. P. 12.02\nmotion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint only. Consequently, a response by Mr.\nHenderson and/or further discovery would have worked no benefit to him.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order of the trial court dismissing Mr. Henderson’s\nComplaint. Costs of this appeal are assessed against the Appellant, Sherman Alexander Henderson,\nand his surety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 __________________________________________\n                                                 W.

The classic analysis\nfor such challenges involves the application of differing standards depending upon the effect. That\nanalysis requires strict scrutiny only when the classification interferes with a fundamental right or\noperates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class. State v. Tester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752509\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752509/state-v-tester/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828\n(Tenn.1994). The standard of reduced scrutiny applies in other situations requiring only that a\nrational basis exist for the classification, or that the classification have a reasonable relationship to\na legitimate state interest. Id. Unless a suspect classification or denial of a fundamental right to a\nparticular class is involved, equal protection attacks on prison regulations are analyzed to determine\nwhether distinctions between groups have a rational basis, or, more particularly, whether they are\nreasonably related to penological interests.

Booher v. U.S. Postal Serv.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504043\"><a href=\"/opinion/504043/michael-booher-v-united-states-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944 (6th Cir.1988). In Booher, a discharged probationary employee alleged that he\nwas \"singled out\" for discharge and other probationary employees with worse attendance records\nwere not discharged. Id. The Sixth Circuit noted that Booher sought to make out a violation of equal\nprotection by claiming he was treated differently from other similarly situated employees. The Court\nconcluded that Booher’s claim ultimately failed because there was no claim that Booher was\nvictimized because of some suspect classification, which is an essential element of an equal\nprotection claim, and that, even assuming there was an unjustified action taken against Booher, this\nsingle action, without more, cannot form the basis of an equal protection claim. Id. The Booher\nCourt reiterated that the equal protection concept does not create a classification of persons who\nreceived better treatment. Id. In other words, an equal protection claim does not arise simply because\nof differing treatment.\n\n        This reasoning has been applied in the context of a prisoner challenging his reclassification\nand transfer by prison officials.

After first determining that the prisoner did not have a\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest, the court held that \"the plaintiff could not make out a\nviolation of his equal protection rights simply by showing that other inmates were treated\ndifferently.\" Id. Relying upon Booher, the Newell Court held that the prisoner would have to show\nhe was reclassified because of some suspect classification. Id. Similarly, a prisoner alleging\nselective enforcement of a prison regulation cannot sustain an equal protection claim absent an\nassertion and a showing of some purposeful discrimination. Fletcher v. Chartrand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519733\"><a href=\"/opinion/519733/gordon-louis-v-by-rite-oil-company-dba-express-oil-shops-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(6th Cir.1989) (citing McCleskey v.

Mr. Henderson only alleges that he was “singled\nout and victimized because of his classification within his group of prisoners convicted of first\ndegree murder.” First degree murderers are not protected as a suspect class. Consequently, there\nneed only be a rationale basis for Mr. Henderson’s custody status being changed that is reasonably\nrelated to a penological interest. Lee v.

See T.C.A. §4-6-102 (2005). Mr. Henderson asserts that he was moved “to a more\nsecure housing unit...due to the parole board having declined plaintiff for seven (7) years[.]”\nConsidering the effect of a decline of parole on a prisoner’s propensity to escape or to act out\ninappropriately, movement to a more secure housing unit or a change in custody status of the inmate\nwould certainly be rational under the circumstances and would serve the legitimate penological\ninterest of maintaining security and order. Consequently, and for the foregoing reasons, we find that\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fthe trial court did not err in finding that Mr. Henderson fails to state a claim for violation of his right\nto equal protection.\n\n        Having concluded that the trial court properly dismissed Mr. Henderson’s claim on the basis\nthat Mr. Henderson failed to state a cause of action for equal protection violation, we also conclude\nthat the trial court did not err in suspending discovery and/or in granting the Motion to Dismiss\nbefore Mr. Henderson was allowed to respond to same. As discussed above, a Tenn R. Civ. P. 12.02\nmotion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint only. Consequently, a response by Mr.\nHenderson and/or further discovery would have worked no benefit to him.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order of the trial court dismissing Mr. Henderson’s\nComplaint. Costs of this appeal are assessed against the Appellant, Sherman Alexander Henderson,\nand his surety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 __________________________________________\n                                                 W.
