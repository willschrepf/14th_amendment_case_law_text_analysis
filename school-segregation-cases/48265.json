Britt, 133 Ohio St.3d 217, 2012-Ohio-4541.]\nAttorneys—Misconduct—Failure to provide competent representation—Failure to\n        act with reasonable diligence in representing client—Charging an\n        excessive fee—Failure to properly supervise staff—Failure to hold fees in\n        trust account until earned—Indefinite suspension.\n    (No. 2011-2043—Submitted March 21, 2012—Decided October 3, 2012.)\n    ON CERTIFIED REPORT by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and\n                     Discipline of the Supreme Court, No. 10-048.\n                                   __________________\n        Per Curiam.\n        {¶ 1} Respondent, Curtis D. Britt of Dayton, Ohio, Attorney Registration\nNo. 0070966, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1999. In March\n2007, he was also admitted to the bar in Kentucky. Although his Kentucky\nlicense was suspended from December 2008 to November 2009 for nonpayment\nof his bar dues, that license is now in good standing.1\n        {¶ 2} In June 2010, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged Britt\nwith multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct arising from his\nhandling of a client’s bankruptcy matter. In a second amended complaint, relator\nfurther alleged that Britt had collected retainers and filing fees from more than 40\nclients, converted those funds, and failed to perform the promised services and\nthat the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) had obtained levies against him for\npast-due employee tax withholdings.\n\n1. It appears, however, that Britt has a nonpractice exemption for which he has voluntarily agreed\nnot to practice law in Kentucky until the exemption is removed by the Continuing Legal Education\nCommission upon certification of completion of appropriate continuing-legal-education credit\nhours. See http://www.kybar.org/26 (accessed Aug. 23, 2012).\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 3} The parties stipulated that Britt neglected numerous client matters;\nfailed to reasonably communicate with his clients; failed to preserve the identity\nof client funds and property; and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation and conduct that was prejudicial to the administration\nof justice by converting those funds to his own use and that his conduct adversely\nreflects on his fitness to practice law.\n        {¶ 4} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and\nDiscipline adopted the parties’ stipulations of fact and misconduct.         After a\nhearing, where the panel heard Britt’s testimony and received exhibits, the panel\nrecommended that he be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio\nand ordered to make full restitution to those clients affected by his misconduct.\nThe board adopted the panel’s report in its entirety.\n        {¶ 5} Relator objects to the board’s recommended sanction, arguing that\nBritt’s conduct warrants permanent disbarment. For the reasons that follow, we\noverrule relator’s objection, adopt the board’s findings of fact, conclusions of law,\nand recommended sanction with the additional requirements that Britt complete\n12 hours of continuing legal education (“CLE”) in law-office and trust-account\nmanagement and that he serve one year of monitored probation upon his\nreinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio.\n                                     Misconduct\n                                      Count One\n        {¶ 6} With respect to Count One, the parties stipulated and the board\nfound that Sonya Weaver met Britt through Total Bankruptcy, a website that\nprovided bankruptcy client referrals for a fee. At her first appointment, Weaver\nmet Britt’s employee, Kenneth Cooper, who, although he was not an attorney,\ntold her that she would qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy notwithstanding her\nownership interest in three time-share properties. Cooper also advised her to stop\npaying her credit-card bills and quit her part-time job, which she did.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 7} At that February 6, 2009 appointment, Weaver signed a fee\nagreement that required her to pay a $1,000 flat fee plus filing fees, and within\nseveral weeks she wrote two checks to Britt for a total of $1,424. By early\nMarch, she had returned her completed paperwork and bank records to Britt’s\noffice and completed an online credit-counseling course. At her first meeting\nwith Britt in April 2009, he informed her that Chapter 7 bankruptcy might not be\na viable option, given her ownership interest in certain property, including the\ntime-share properties she had disclosed to Cooper, but that he needed additional\ninformation to make a final determination.\n       {¶ 8} At a brief meeting several days later, Britt reviewed Weaver’s\ndocuments and confirmed that Chapter 7 bankruptcy was not a viable option.\nWhen Weaver expressed dissatisfaction because she had relied on Cooper’s\nflawed advice and was two months behind in her credit-card payments, Britt\nsuggested that she contact her creditors to set up a payment plan.\n       {¶ 9} On April 30, 2009, Weaver sent Britt a certified letter terminating\nhis representation and requesting the return of her file, an itemized statement of\nthe legal services rendered, and the return of any unearned fees. Approximately\none month later, Britt sent her a $499 check—$299 for the filing fee and $200 for\nunearned legal fees—but he failed to provide an itemized statement of the\nservices provided and failed to return her file.          He had not kept any\ncontemporaneous time records in Weaver’s case, but in responding to relator’s\ninquiries, he maintained that he had earned $925 for two hours of direct\nconsultation with Weaver and one hour of file review, billed at $225 per hour,\n$150 for administrative work performed by his assistant, and a $50\nreimbursement for Weaver’s credit-counseling course.            Weaver, however,\ndisputed that she had spent two hours with Britt. She has retained new counsel to\nassist her with her bankruptcy filing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     Count Two\n       {¶ 10} With regard to Count Two, the parties stipulated and the board\nfound that in May 2010, Britt agreed to represent Craig Smith in a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. Smith paid a retainer of $800 and gave Britt $299 for the filing fee,\nand Britt deposited the money into his operating account. Britt did not promptly\nfile the bankruptcy petition and did not respond to Smith’s inquiries.             He\nstipulated that the delay in filing was due, in part, to the fact that he had spent the\nfiling fee on unrelated matters. He did eventually file the petition, but only after\nhe received and misapplied other client funds to pay the filing fee.\n                                    Count Three\n       {¶ 11} Neil Frazier retained Britt in October 2009 to represent him in the\ndissolution of his marriage. He gave Britt an $800 retainer and $250 for the filing\nfee, which Britt deposited in his operating account. Frazier terminated Britt’s\nrepresentation in October 2010 based upon his lack of communication and his\nfailure to file the petition for dissolution. Britt failed to refund Frazier’s money\nbecause he had spent it on other matters.\n                                    Count Four\n       {¶ 12} During relator’s investigation of the Smith grievance, Britt\nadmitted that he had a client trust account but that he regularly deposited client\nmoney, whether earned or unearned, into his operating account.             During his\nSeptember 28, 2010 deposition, he admitted that he had accepted employment,\nretainers, and filing fees from 24 to 30 additional bankruptcy clients. He further\nacknowledged that he had spent their money on other matters and had failed to\nfile their bankruptcy petitions. Although relator asked Britt to provide names and\ncontact information for these clients by October 8, 2010, he did not comply with\nthe request until approximately November 4, 2010—after he had retained counsel.\n       {¶ 13} The documents Britt provided to relator demonstrated that he had\naccepted over $40,000 in retainers and filing fees from 41 clients, in addition to\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nthe clients discussed in Counts One through Three, and deposited all of the money\ninto his operating account. Britt used those funds, in part, for his own purposes\nwithout any regard to whether he had earned them. He did not take any action to\nnotify the affected clients of his misconduct until after relator initiated its\ninvestigation. At the time of the panel hearing, Britt had not made restitution to\nany of the affected clients, though he had been paying $1,000 per month ($9,350\nin all) to local bankruptcy attorney Nick Zingarelli, who had assumed the\nrepresentation of some of the affected clients.\n       {¶ 14} The parties further stipulated and the board found that as a result of\nBritt’s failure to withhold federal income taxes or pay unemployment taxes, the\nIRS had filed two levies, totaling more than $16,000, against him in the\nbankruptcy court. Consequently, the bankruptcy trustee has remitted fees earned\nby Britt to the IRS.\n                                    Violations\n       {¶ 15} The parties stipulated and the board found that Britt violated\nProf.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a\nclient) by failing to provide Weaver with competent representation as a result of\nhis flawed office intake and review process and violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.5\n(prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an\nillegal or clearly excessive fee) and 7.1 (prohibiting a lawyer from making or\nusing false, misleading, or nonverifiable communication about the lawyer or the\nlawyer’s services) by failing to provide Weaver the free initial consultation that\nthe Total Bankruptcy website had promised. The parties also stipulated and the\nboard found that Britt aided in the unauthorized practice of law by failing to\nproperly supervise Cooper, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 5.3(b) (requiring a lawyer\nto make reasonable efforts to ensure that a nonlawyer employee’s conduct is\ncompatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer) and 5.5(a) (prohibiting\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\na lawyer from assisting another to practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the\nregulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction).\n       {¶ 16} With respect to the remaining counts, the parties stipulated and the\nboard found that Brit failed to provide diligent, prompt, and competent\nrepresentation to his clients in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.1, 1.3 (requiring a\nlawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client) and 1.4 (requiring\na lawyer to reasonably communicate with a client), that he violated Prof.Cond.R.\n1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client\ntrust account, separate from the lawyer’s own property) and (c) (requiring a\nlawyer to deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been\npaid in advance) by failing to properly segregate client funds in a client trust\naccount, that he violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging\nin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and (d)\n(prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice) by converting client funds, and that the sum of his\nconduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, in violation of\nProf.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that\nadversely reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice law).\n       {¶ 17} We adopt the board’s findings of fact and misconduct.\n                                       Sanction\n       {¶ 18} Noting that taking retainers from clients and failing to perform the\npromised work is tantamount to theft, relator argued that the appropriate sanction\nfor Britt’s conduct is disbarment. Britt, in contrast, requested that the board\nrecommend a two-year suspension, with reinstatement conditioned upon his\nmaking full restitution to the affected clients.\n       {¶ 19} The board found that Britt should be indefinitely suspended from\nthe practice of law in Ohio and ordered to pay full restitution to the clients\naffected by his misconduct. Relator objects to the board’s recommendation and\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nargues that permanent disbarment is the only appropriate sanction for the\nmisconduct at issue in this case.\n       {¶ 20} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider\nrelevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the\nsanctions imposed in similar cases. Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, 96 Ohio\nSt.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, ¶ 16.              In making a final\ndetermination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors\nlisted in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10. Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, 115 Ohio St.3d\n473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, ¶ 21.\n       {¶ 21} Here, in addition to Britt’s treating his flat fees as earned upon\nreceipt, depositing them with his client’s fee deposits into his operating account,\nand spending the money without performing the promised work, he has also aided\nin the unauthorized practice of law by failing to adequately supervise Cooper, and\ncharged a clearly excessive fee.\n       {¶ 22} We have held that disbarment is the presumptive sanction for\nmisappropriation, but we have recognized that this sanction may be tempered with\nsufficient evidence of mitigating or extenuating circumstances. See, e.g., Dayton\nBar Assn. v. Gerren, 103 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-4110, 812 N.E.2d 1280, ¶ 14,\nciting Disciplinary Counsel v. France, 97 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-5945, 778\nN.E.2d 573, ¶ 11 (presumptive disciplinary measure for acts of misappropriation\nis disbarment); Disciplinary Counsel v. Smith, 101 Ohio St.3d 27, 2003-Ohio-\n6623, 800 N.E.2d 1129, ¶ 9 (lesser sanction of indefinite suspension based on the\nmitigating evidence that respondent had been licensed to practice for\napproximately 45 years without any previous ethical infraction); Disciplinary\nCounsel v. Garrity, 98 Ohio St.3d 317, 2003-Ohio-740, 784 N.E.2d 691\n(indefinitely suspending a lawyer and former pharmacist convicted of stealing\nprescription drugs for his own use where mitigating factors included the lawyer’s\ndrug addiction, demonstrated commitment to sobriety, cooperation in the\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ninvestigations leading to and arising out of his drug-related convictions, and the\nabsence of harm to his legal clients).\n       {¶ 23} Relator argues that Britt has failed to present sufficient mitigating\nevidence to overcome the presumptive sanction of disbarment.          Specifically,\nrelator argues that this court has deviated from the presumptive sanction in cases\ninvolving only a handful of clients and significant mitigation such as a mental\nillness or addiction or in cases where the respondent has practiced for many years\nwithout misconduct—factors that are not present in this case.           See, e.g.,\nDisciplinary Counsel v. Squire, 130 Ohio St.3d 368, 2011-Ohio-5578, 958 N.E.2d\n914, ¶ 65-66, 70 (indefinitely suspending an attorney who failed to hold client\nfunds separate from his own property, misappropriated client funds for his own\nbenefit, failed to maintain detailed records of the money held and disbursed on\nbehalf of his clients, failed to maintain or produce documentation to support\nclaimed client-related expenditures, borrowed money from clients without\ndisclosing the inherent conflicts of such arrangements or advising his clients to\nseek independent counsel, engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit,\nor misrepresentation, and knowingly made false statements of material fact during\nthe ensuing disciplinary proceeding when mitigating factors included practice of\nmore than 25 years without disciplinary action), citing Akron Bar Assn. v.\nSmithern, 125 Ohio St.3d 72, 2010-Ohio-652, 926 N.E.2d 274 (indefinitely\nsuspending an attorney for converting client funds on more than 30 separate\noccasions and for depositing more than $100,000 in client retainers in her\npersonal bank account rather than in her firm’s trust account when mitigating\nfactors included more than 20 years of practice without disciplinary violations,\ncooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, an agreement to make full restitution,\nand gambling and alcohol addictions that were causally related to the attorney’s\nmisconduct); and Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Harris, 96 Ohio St.3d 138, 2002-Ohio-\n2988, 772 N.E.2d 621 (indefinitely suspending an attorney who converted more\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nthan $29,000 in client funds when mitigating factors included the attorney’s status\nas a military veteran, his 27 years of practice without incident, and letters and\ntestimony from his pastor and several professional acquaintances, including\ncurrent and former judges, attesting to his dedication and trustworthiness).\n       {¶ 24} As aggravating factors in this case, we find that Britt has engaged\nin a pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses. See BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(1)(c) and (d). The parties also stipulated that the vulnerability of and harm\nto Britt’s clients, who had limited resources and whose bankruptcy filings were\ndelayed, sometimes indefinitely, by Britt’s neglect and conversion of their fees,\nare an aggravating factor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h). And although Britt\nhas retained attorney Nick Zingarelli to assist some clients affected by his\nmisconduct and paid him more than $9,000 for that work, at the time of the panel\nhearing, there were other clients to whom Britt had made no restitution. See\nBCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(i).\n       {¶ 25} Relator argues that Britt acted with a dishonest or selfish motive\nbecause he deposited his clients’ funds into his operating account and then used\nthem to pay his professional and personal obligations. See BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(1)(b).\n       {¶ 26} At the panel hearing, Britt testified that he spent 20 years in the Air\nForce working in the areas of federal acquisitions and contract management and\nthat upon his honorable discharge from the service in 1996, he chose to attend law\nschool. Upon graduating from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in\n1999, he worked as a foreclosure attorney for two law firms and then became a\nstaff attorney for a title company. He was laid off by the title company in October\n2007 and shared office space with a friend for approximately six months before\nan Indianapolis law firm opened an office in the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash\nand hired him to handle consumer bankruptcy matters for clients obtained through\nan Internet-based referral service. Britt was the only employee at the Blue Ash\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nlocation and had no experience in bankruptcy law. He quit after two of his first\nthree paychecks bounced.\n        {¶ 27} After leaving the firm, Britt took the suggestion of Ken Cooper,\nthe Indianapolis firm’s business and marketing manager, and opened his own\nbankruptcy firm, using the same Internet referral service to obtain clients. He\nmaintained an office in Blue Ash from July 2008 through July 2009, an office in\nthe Cincinnati suburb of Kenwood from October 2008 to November 2009, an\noffice in Cincinnati from February 2009 through January 2010, and an office in\nFlorence, Kentucky, from October 2008 through September 2010. His conduct in\nthis case does not appear to have been dishonest or selfish. It was born of his\ninexperience and lack of guidance as he commenced and rapidly expanded his\nsolo practice.\n        {¶ 28} As the board found, and relator now argues, Britt has failed to\ndemonstrate that his diagnosis of depression is a mitigating factor pursuant to\nBCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) because his evaluating psychiatrist opined that his\ncondition “was not severe enough to substantially impair his ability to practice\nlaw.” (Emphasis sic.) Nonetheless, we find that sufficient mitigating factors are\npresent to warrant an indefinite suspension rather than a permanent disbarment in\nthis case.\n        {¶ 29} First, Britt has no prior disciplinary record.     BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(2)(a). Britt also made a full and free disclosure to the board and displayed\na cooperative attitude toward the proceedings. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). He\nresponded to relator’s letters of inquiry and agreed to be deposed on two separate\noccasions. He admitted the misconduct alleged in the initial grievances against\nhim. And when questioned during his second deposition about his handling of\nclient funds, he admitted that he routinely deposited client payments, including\nfiling-fee deposits, directly into his operating account.       At that time, Britt\nestimated that he had 25 to 30 clients whose bankruptcy petitions had not been\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nfiled because he no longer had the money to pay the filing fees. This disclosure\nresulted in additional charges levied against Britt in relator’s second amended\ncomplaint.\n       {¶ 30} Not only was Britt candid with relator, he also openly\nacknowledged his own misconduct to the affected clients. In letters to each of\nthem, Britt set out the amount of the payments he had received and advised them:\n\n\n       These monies should have been deposited into my attorney trust\n       account and held there until earned. I did not deposit them into my\n       trust account but instead deposited them into my operating\n       account.    Additionally, I have not instituted your bankruptcy\n       proceeding and so no fees were earned by me. In plain English, I\n       spent the money you paid me before it was earned. My failure to\n       properly hold your money in trust until earned and my failure to\n       prosecute your bankruptcy are both serious ethical violations to\n       which I have admitted. I am currently being prosecuted by the\n       Cincinnati Bar Association in an action pending before the Board\n       of Commissioners on Grievance[s] and Discipline.\n\n\n       {¶ 31} Britt advised his clients that he had made arrangements with\nattorney Zingarelli to complete their representation, if they so chose, and\nexplained that once his disciplinary action was resolved, his clients could file\nclaims with the Client Security Fund. He also apologized to his clients, stating:\n\n\n       I know that I have violated your trust and put you in jeopardy by\n       not timely performing the services I promised to perform. I have\n       been suffering from depression and have only recently begun to\n       receive treatment. I say this as an explanation and not an excuse.\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       As you may know, I served in the Air Force for 20 years and was\n       honorably discharged. I have a family and have always prided\n       myself on being an honest, contributing member of our\n       community. I have dishonored myself and my profession and have\n       let you down. I cannot adequately convey how sorry I am for my\n       actions.\n\n\n       {¶ 32} Britt offered a sincere apology to the members of the panel and\nexpressed his desire to return to the practice of law at some point in the future so\nthat he could provide pro bono services for a nonprofit organization in an effort to\nfulfill his obligations to the public and to restore his honor and integrity. He has\nalso submitted letters from four former clients and one colleague attesting to his\ncompetency, integrity, and professionalism. The writers do not state that they are\naware of the pending disciplinary action against Britt, but at a minimum, their\nletters offer some indication that Britt can be rehabilitated.\n       {¶ 33} Based on the foregoing, and in light of the sincerity with which\nBritt has expressed both his remorse and his desire to make amends for his\nmisconduct, we believe that he may one day be able resume the competent,\nethical, and professional practice of law.        Therefore, we overrule relator’s\nobjections and adopt the board’s recommended sanction of an indefinite\nsuspension coupled with an order of restitution. Recognizing, however, that\nBritt’s inexperience and lack of guidance contributed significantly to his\nmisconduct, we supplement the board’s recommended sanction with the\nadditional requirements that Britt complete 12 hours of CLE in law-office and\ntrust-account management before seeking reinstatement and serve a one-year\nperiod of monitored probation upon reinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio.\n       {¶ 34} Accordingly, Curtis D. Britt is indefinitely suspended from the\npractice of law in Ohio and ordered to provide to relator, within 30 days of this\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nopinion, documentation of all funds received from Sonya Weaver, Craig Smith,\nNeil Frazier, and each of the clients identified in Exhibits D, K, L, and M of Joint\nExhibit 1 and make restitution to those clients (or their designated payees) in the\naggregate amount of $2,000 per month until he has made full restitution. Britt is\nfurther ordered to provide a monthly accounting to relator of all restitution\npayments made pursuant to this order, commencing with 30 days of this opinion.\nAny future reinstatement shall be conditioned on proof that Britt has fully\ncomplied with this restitution order and completed 12 hours of CLE in law-office\nand trust-account management in addition to the general requirements of Gov.Bar\nR. X. Furthermore, upon reinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio, Britt is\nordered to serve one year of monitored probation in accordance with Gov.Bar R.\nV(9).

Britt of Dayton, Ohio, Attorney Registration\nNo. 0070966, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1999. In March\n2007, he was also admitted to the bar in Kentucky. Although his Kentucky\nlicense was suspended from December 2008 to November 2009 for nonpayment\nof his bar dues, that license is now in good standing.1\n        {¶ 2} In June 2010, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged Britt\nwith multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct arising from his\nhandling of a client’s bankruptcy matter. In a second amended complaint, relator\nfurther alleged that Britt had collected retainers and filing fees from more than 40\nclients, converted those funds, and failed to perform the promised services and\nthat the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) had obtained levies against him for\npast-due employee tax withholdings.\n\n1. It appears, however, that Britt has a nonpractice exemption for which he has voluntarily agreed\nnot to practice law in Kentucky until the exemption is removed by the Continuing Legal Education\nCommission upon certification of completion of appropriate continuing-legal-education credit\nhours. See http://www.kybar.org/26 (accessed Aug. 23, 2012).\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 3} The parties stipulated that Britt neglected numerous client matters;\nfailed to reasonably communicate with his clients; failed to preserve the identity\nof client funds and property; and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation and conduct that was prejudicial to the administration\nof justice by converting those funds to his own use and that his conduct adversely\nreflects on his fitness to practice law.\n        {¶ 4} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and\nDiscipline adopted the parties’ stipulations of fact and misconduct.         After a\nhearing, where the panel heard Britt’s testimony and received exhibits, the panel\nrecommended that he be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio\nand ordered to make full restitution to those clients affected by his misconduct.\nThe board adopted the panel’s report in its entirety.\n        {¶ 5} Relator objects to the board’s recommended sanction, arguing that\nBritt’s conduct warrants permanent disbarment. For the reasons that follow, we\noverrule relator’s objection, adopt the board’s findings of fact, conclusions of law,\nand recommended sanction with the additional requirements that Britt complete\n12 hours of continuing legal education (“CLE”) in law-office and trust-account\nmanagement and that he serve one year of monitored probation upon his\nreinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio.\n                                     Misconduct\n                                      Count One\n        {¶ 6} With respect to Count One, the parties stipulated and the board\nfound that Sonya Weaver met Britt through Total Bankruptcy, a website that\nprovided bankruptcy client referrals for a fee. At her first appointment, Weaver\nmet Britt’s employee, Kenneth Cooper, who, although he was not an attorney,\ntold her that she would qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy notwithstanding her\nownership interest in three time-share properties. Cooper also advised her to stop\npaying her credit-card bills and quit her part-time job, which she did.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 7} At that February 6, 2009 appointment, Weaver signed a fee\nagreement that required her to pay a $1,000 flat fee plus filing fees, and within\nseveral weeks she wrote two checks to Britt for a total of $1,424. By early\nMarch, she had returned her completed paperwork and bank records to Britt’s\noffice and completed an online credit-counseling course. At her first meeting\nwith Britt in April 2009, he informed her that Chapter 7 bankruptcy might not be\na viable option, given her ownership interest in certain property, including the\ntime-share properties she had disclosed to Cooper, but that he needed additional\ninformation to make a final determination.\n       {¶ 8} At a brief meeting several days later, Britt reviewed Weaver’s\ndocuments and confirmed that Chapter 7 bankruptcy was not a viable option.\nWhen Weaver expressed dissatisfaction because she had relied on Cooper’s\nflawed advice and was two months behind in her credit-card payments, Britt\nsuggested that she contact her creditors to set up a payment plan.\n       {¶ 9} On April 30, 2009, Weaver sent Britt a certified letter terminating\nhis representation and requesting the return of her file, an itemized statement of\nthe legal services rendered, and the return of any unearned fees. Approximately\none month later, Britt sent her a $499 check—$299 for the filing fee and $200 for\nunearned legal fees—but he failed to provide an itemized statement of the\nservices provided and failed to return her file.          He had not kept any\ncontemporaneous time records in Weaver’s case, but in responding to relator’s\ninquiries, he maintained that he had earned $925 for two hours of direct\nconsultation with Weaver and one hour of file review, billed at $225 per hour,\n$150 for administrative work performed by his assistant, and a $50\nreimbursement for Weaver’s credit-counseling course.            Weaver, however,\ndisputed that she had spent two hours with Britt. She has retained new counsel to\nassist her with her bankruptcy filing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     Count Two\n       {¶ 10} With regard to Count Two, the parties stipulated and the board\nfound that in May 2010, Britt agreed to represent Craig Smith in a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. Smith paid a retainer of $800 and gave Britt $299 for the filing fee,\nand Britt deposited the money into his operating account. Britt did not promptly\nfile the bankruptcy petition and did not respond to Smith’s inquiries.             He\nstipulated that the delay in filing was due, in part, to the fact that he had spent the\nfiling fee on unrelated matters. He did eventually file the petition, but only after\nhe received and misapplied other client funds to pay the filing fee.\n                                    Count Three\n       {¶ 11} Neil Frazier retained Britt in October 2009 to represent him in the\ndissolution of his marriage. He gave Britt an $800 retainer and $250 for the filing\nfee, which Britt deposited in his operating account. Frazier terminated Britt’s\nrepresentation in October 2010 based upon his lack of communication and his\nfailure to file the petition for dissolution. Britt failed to refund Frazier’s money\nbecause he had spent it on other matters.\n                                    Count Four\n       {¶ 12} During relator’s investigation of the Smith grievance, Britt\nadmitted that he had a client trust account but that he regularly deposited client\nmoney, whether earned or unearned, into his operating account.             During his\nSeptember 28, 2010 deposition, he admitted that he had accepted employment,\nretainers, and filing fees from 24 to 30 additional bankruptcy clients. He further\nacknowledged that he had spent their money on other matters and had failed to\nfile their bankruptcy petitions. Although relator asked Britt to provide names and\ncontact information for these clients by October 8, 2010, he did not comply with\nthe request until approximately November 4, 2010—after he had retained counsel.\n       {¶ 13} The documents Britt provided to relator demonstrated that he had\naccepted over $40,000 in retainers and filing fees from 41 clients, in addition to\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nthe clients discussed in Counts One through Three, and deposited all of the money\ninto his operating account. Britt used those funds, in part, for his own purposes\nwithout any regard to whether he had earned them. He did not take any action to\nnotify the affected clients of his misconduct until after relator initiated its\ninvestigation. At the time of the panel hearing, Britt had not made restitution to\nany of the affected clients, though he had been paying $1,000 per month ($9,350\nin all) to local bankruptcy attorney Nick Zingarelli, who had assumed the\nrepresentation of some of the affected clients.\n       {¶ 14} The parties further stipulated and the board found that as a result of\nBritt’s failure to withhold federal income taxes or pay unemployment taxes, the\nIRS had filed two levies, totaling more than $16,000, against him in the\nbankruptcy court. Consequently, the bankruptcy trustee has remitted fees earned\nby Britt to the IRS.\n                                    Violations\n       {¶ 15} The parties stipulated and the board found that Britt violated\nProf.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a\nclient) by failing to provide Weaver with competent representation as a result of\nhis flawed office intake and review process and violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.5\n(prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an\nillegal or clearly excessive fee) and 7.1 (prohibiting a lawyer from making or\nusing false, misleading, or nonverifiable communication about the lawyer or the\nlawyer’s services) by failing to provide Weaver the free initial consultation that\nthe Total Bankruptcy website had promised. The parties also stipulated and the\nboard found that Britt aided in the unauthorized practice of law by failing to\nproperly supervise Cooper, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 5.3(b) (requiring a lawyer\nto make reasonable efforts to ensure that a nonlawyer employee’s conduct is\ncompatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer) and 5.5(a) (prohibiting\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\na lawyer from assisting another to practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the\nregulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction).\n       {¶ 16} With respect to the remaining counts, the parties stipulated and the\nboard found that Brit failed to provide diligent, prompt, and competent\nrepresentation to his clients in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.1, 1.3 (requiring a\nlawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client) and 1.4 (requiring\na lawyer to reasonably communicate with a client), that he violated Prof.Cond.R.\n1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client\ntrust account, separate from the lawyer’s own property) and (c) (requiring a\nlawyer to deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been\npaid in advance) by failing to properly segregate client funds in a client trust\naccount, that he violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging\nin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and (d)\n(prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice) by converting client funds, and that the sum of his\nconduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, in violation of\nProf.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that\nadversely reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice law).\n       {¶ 17} We adopt the board’s findings of fact and misconduct.\n                                       Sanction\n       {¶ 18} Noting that taking retainers from clients and failing to perform the\npromised work is tantamount to theft, relator argued that the appropriate sanction\nfor Britt’s conduct is disbarment. Britt, in contrast, requested that the board\nrecommend a two-year suspension, with reinstatement conditioned upon his\nmaking full restitution to the affected clients.\n       {¶ 19} The board found that Britt should be indefinitely suspended from\nthe practice of law in Ohio and ordered to pay full restitution to the clients\naffected by his misconduct. Relator objects to the board’s recommendation and\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nargues that permanent disbarment is the only appropriate sanction for the\nmisconduct at issue in this case.\n       {¶ 20} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider\nrelevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the\nsanctions imposed in similar cases.

Specifically,\nrelator argues that this court has deviated from the presumptive sanction in cases\ninvolving only a handful of clients and significant mitigation such as a mental\nillness or addiction or in cases where the respondent has practiced for many years\nwithout misconduct—factors that are not present in this case.

See BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(1)(c) and (d). The parties also stipulated that the vulnerability of and harm\nto Britt’s clients, who had limited resources and whose bankruptcy filings were\ndelayed, sometimes indefinitely, by Britt’s neglect and conversion of their fees,\nare an aggravating factor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h). And although Britt\nhas retained attorney Nick Zingarelli to assist some clients affected by his\nmisconduct and paid him more than $9,000 for that work, at the time of the panel\nhearing, there were other clients to whom Britt had made no restitution. See\nBCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(i).\n       {¶ 25} Relator argues that Britt acted with a dishonest or selfish motive\nbecause he deposited his clients’ funds into his operating account and then used\nthem to pay his professional and personal obligations. See BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(1)(b).\n       {¶ 26} At the panel hearing, Britt testified that he spent 20 years in the Air\nForce working in the areas of federal acquisitions and contract management and\nthat upon his honorable discharge from the service in 1996, he chose to attend law\nschool. Upon graduating from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in\n1999, he worked as a foreclosure attorney for two law firms and then became a\nstaff attorney for a title company. He was laid off by the title company in October\n2007 and shared office space with a friend for approximately six months before\nan Indianapolis law firm opened an office in the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash\nand hired him to handle consumer bankruptcy matters for clients obtained through\nan Internet-based referral service. Britt was the only employee at the Blue Ash\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nlocation and had no experience in bankruptcy law. He quit after two of his first\nthree paychecks bounced.\n        {¶ 27} After leaving the firm, Britt took the suggestion of Ken Cooper,\nthe Indianapolis firm’s business and marketing manager, and opened his own\nbankruptcy firm, using the same Internet referral service to obtain clients. He\nmaintained an office in Blue Ash from July 2008 through July 2009, an office in\nthe Cincinnati suburb of Kenwood from October 2008 to November 2009, an\noffice in Cincinnati from February 2009 through January 2010, and an office in\nFlorence, Kentucky, from October 2008 through September 2010. His conduct in\nthis case does not appear to have been dishonest or selfish. It was born of his\ninexperience and lack of guidance as he commenced and rapidly expanded his\nsolo practice.\n        {¶ 28} As the board found, and relator now argues, Britt has failed to\ndemonstrate that his diagnosis of depression is a mitigating factor pursuant to\nBCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) because his evaluating psychiatrist opined that his\ncondition “was not severe enough to substantially impair his ability to practice\nlaw.” (Emphasis sic.) Nonetheless, we find that sufficient mitigating factors are\npresent to warrant an indefinite suspension rather than a permanent disbarment in\nthis case.\n        {¶ 29} First, Britt has no prior disciplinary record.     BCGD Proc.Reg.\n10(B)(2)(a). Britt also made a full and free disclosure to the board and displayed\na cooperative attitude toward the proceedings. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). He\nresponded to relator’s letters of inquiry and agreed to be deposed on two separate\noccasions. He admitted the misconduct alleged in the initial grievances against\nhim. And when questioned during his second deposition about his handling of\nclient funds, he admitted that he routinely deposited client payments, including\nfiling-fee deposits, directly into his operating account.       At that time, Britt\nestimated that he had 25 to 30 clients whose bankruptcy petitions had not been\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nfiled because he no longer had the money to pay the filing fees. This disclosure\nresulted in additional charges levied against Britt in relator’s second amended\ncomplaint.\n       {¶ 30} Not only was Britt candid with relator, he also openly\nacknowledged his own misconduct to the affected clients. In letters to each of\nthem, Britt set out the amount of the payments he had received and advised them:\n\n\n       These monies should have been deposited into my attorney trust\n       account and held there until earned. I did not deposit them into my\n       trust account but instead deposited them into my operating\n       account.    Additionally, I have not instituted your bankruptcy\n       proceeding and so no fees were earned by me. In plain English, I\n       spent the money you paid me before it was earned. My failure to\n       properly hold your money in trust until earned and my failure to\n       prosecute your bankruptcy are both serious ethical violations to\n       which I have admitted. I am currently being prosecuted by the\n       Cincinnati Bar Association in an action pending before the Board\n       of Commissioners on Grievance[s] and Discipline.\n\n\n       {¶ 31} Britt advised his clients that he had made arrangements with\nattorney Zingarelli to complete their representation, if they so chose, and\nexplained that once his disciplinary action was resolved, his clients could file\nclaims with the Client Security Fund. He also apologized to his clients, stating:\n\n\n       I know that I have violated your trust and put you in jeopardy by\n       not timely performing the services I promised to perform. I have\n       been suffering from depression and have only recently begun to\n       receive treatment. I say this as an explanation and not an excuse.\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       As you may know, I served in the Air Force for 20 years and was\n       honorably discharged. I have a family and have always prided\n       myself on being an honest, contributing member of our\n       community. I have dishonored myself and my profession and have\n       let you down. I cannot adequately convey how sorry I am for my\n       actions.\n\n\n       {¶ 32} Britt offered a sincere apology to the members of the panel and\nexpressed his desire to return to the practice of law at some point in the future so\nthat he could provide pro bono services for a nonprofit organization in an effort to\nfulfill his obligations to the public and to restore his honor and integrity. He has\nalso submitted letters from four former clients and one colleague attesting to his\ncompetency, integrity, and professionalism. The writers do not state that they are\naware of the pending disciplinary action against Britt, but at a minimum, their\nletters offer some indication that Britt can be rehabilitated.\n       {¶ 33} Based on the foregoing, and in light of the sincerity with which\nBritt has expressed both his remorse and his desire to make amends for his\nmisconduct, we believe that he may one day be able resume the competent,\nethical, and professional practice of law.        Therefore, we overrule relator’s\nobjections and adopt the board’s recommended sanction of an indefinite\nsuspension coupled with an order of restitution. Recognizing, however, that\nBritt’s inexperience and lack of guidance contributed significantly to his\nmisconduct, we supplement the board’s recommended sanction with the\nadditional requirements that Britt complete 12 hours of CLE in law-office and\ntrust-account management before seeking reinstatement and serve a one-year\nperiod of monitored probation upon reinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio.\n       {¶ 34} Accordingly, Curtis D. Britt is indefinitely suspended from the\npractice of law in Ohio and ordered to provide to relator, within 30 days of this\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nopinion, documentation of all funds received from Sonya Weaver, Craig Smith,\nNeil Frazier, and each of the clients identified in Exhibits D, K, L, and M of Joint\nExhibit 1 and make restitution to those clients (or their designated payees) in the\naggregate amount of $2,000 per month until he has made full restitution. Britt is\nfurther ordered to provide a monthly accounting to relator of all restitution\npayments made pursuant to this order, commencing with 30 days of this opinion.\nAny future reinstatement shall be conditioned on proof that Britt has fully\ncomplied with this restitution order and completed 12 hours of CLE in law-office\nand trust-account management in addition to the general requirements of Gov.Bar\nR. X. Furthermore, upon reinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio, Britt is\nordered to serve one year of monitored probation in accordance with Gov.Bar R.\nV(9). Costs are taxed to Britt.\n                                                            Judgment accordingly.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                               __________________\n       Dimity V.
