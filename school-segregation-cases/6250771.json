Viewing this evidence in\nthe light most favorable to Kramer, the panel concluded that\nthe district court’s characterization of the letter’s contents as\nstigmatizing was erroneous, and that Dr. Cullinan was\nentitled to qualified immunity. The panel further held that\neven if the content were stigmatizing, it was not clearly\nestablished law that charges other than fraud, dishonesty, and\nimmorality would trigger the requirements of a name-clearing\nhearing.

Because it is unlikely that the\ninformation released was stigmatizing, and because it was not\nclearly established as a matter of law that the information was\nstigmatizing, Dr. Cullinan was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n     SOU employed Kramer on an annual appointment basis\nin a dual role, as Executive Director of Jefferson Public Radio\n\f4                     KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\n(Public Radio) and as Executive Director of a related\nfoundation, the JPR Foundation, Inc. (Foundation). Kramer\nreported directly to Dr. Cullinan.\n\n    At some point, Dr. Cullinan became concerned about\ncostly capital projects being undertaken by Foundation, such\nas the acquisition and renovation of a theater and a\nwarehouse. Dr. Cullinan notified Foundation and the Oregon\nUniversity System (University System) Chancellor\n(Chancellor Pernsteiner), of the potential financial risk to\nSOU as a result of Foundation’s projects. Dr. Cullinan also\nraised the issue of conflict-of-interest situations between\nPublic Radio and Foundation.\n\n    In response to Dr. Cullinan’s concerns, Chancellor\nPernsteiner initiated an asset and liability review of Public\nRadio and Foundation. The resulting report (Audit Report)\nconcluded that Foundation’s new projects could impose\n“additional strain” on community fund-raising and “may not\nalign with policy interests of SOU.” The Audit Report also\nnoted inherent problems, including actual, apparent, and\npotential conflicts of interest with Kramer serving as\nExecutive Director of both Public Radio and Foundation. One\nconsequence of that arrangement was “a lack of segregation\nof duties by the Executive Director of [Public Radio] when\nentering into contracts,” which was a conflict of interest\nbecause “one individual cannot adequately represent the\ninterests of two separate parties to the same agreement or\ncontract.” The Audit Report determined that this situation\nwas contrary to SOU’s contract policy.1\n\n\n    1\n         Additionally, Oregon Administrative Rule 580-046-0025(2)\nprovided that a foundation’s governing body, employees, and agents\n“[s]hall not be subject to control by the institution or an institution\n\f                       KRAMER V. CULLINAN                               5\n\n    The Audit Report concluded that there was high internal\ncontrol risk regarding the key areas examined. The report\nincluded recommendations to reduce those risks, including\nprohibiting one person from serving as Executive Director of\nboth Public Radio and Foundation. In response, Dr. Cullinan\nagreed to address the concerns raised by the Audit Report and\neliminate the conflict of interest posed by Kramer’s dual\nroles. Dr. Cullinan convened a task force to address\nimplementation of the recommendations in the Audit Report.\n\n    Kramer resisted limiting his employment to one role, and\ninsisted that it was crucial to Public Radio and Foundation\nthat he continue serving as Executive Director of both\nentities. The task force completed its work, but no\nrecommended resolution of the conflict presented by\nKramer’s dual roles was presented to Dr. Cullinan.\n\n     In the meantime, Kramer launched a counteroffensive,\ndrafting and distributing proposed resolutions to the\nFoundation Board (Board). The resolutions would have\ndramatically altered the relationship between SOU and\nFoundation, deprived SOU of assets, and secured Kramer’s\nposition at Foundation. The resolutions were to be voted upon\nat the Board meeting scheduled for March 22, 2012.\n\n    Upon learning of Kramer’s proposed resolutions, Dr.\nCullinan sought the advice of counsel, who sent a letter\n(Miller Nash Letter) to Foundation’s attorney, dated the same\nday as the scheduled board meeting. The Miller Nash Letter\nincluded a copy of the Audit Report and highlighted the\nrecommendation that SOU eliminate the conflict of interest\n\n\nemployee” and “[s]hall not give the appearance that the institution or any\nof its officers or employees control the foundation or its property.”\n\f6                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\npresented by Kramer’s dual role. The Miller Nash Letter\ninformed Foundation that SOU considered Kramer’s\nproposed resolutions counterproductive, and requested that\nFoundation’s Board not adopt the proposed resolutions. The\nLetter also outlined potential avenues of legal redress against\nFoundation, its Board, and/or Kramer, to protect SOU’s rights\nin Public Radio and its assets.\n\n     The Miller Nash Letter also addressed the directors’ and\nKramer’s potential liability, outlining reasons why they might\nnot be protected by directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\nIt is this portion of the Miller Nash Letter that precipitated\nKramer’s claim of stigmatization. In the course of explaining\nwhy indemnification might not be available to Kramer or\nFoundation’s directors, the Miller Nash Letter opined that\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability policies generally “exclude\ncoverage for intentional acts, waste, or fraud.” The Miller\nNash Letter contained the following language that Kramer\nalso identified as stigmatizing:\n\n        Nor do we see a clear path to indemnity.\n        Article X of the bylaws forbids\n        indemnification for actions taken in bad faith\n        or through willful misconduct. If any actions\n        of Mr. Kramer or the Foundation’s directors\n        (including past actions and the adoption of the\n        Proposed Resolutions) are determined to have\n        been made in bad faith or through willful\n        misconduct, neither Mr. Kramer nor the\n        Foundation’s directors will be entitled to\n        indemnification, and they are unlikely to be\n        entitled to protection under any directors’ and\n        officers’ liability insurance.\n\f                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN                       7\n\nThe Miller Nash Letter also contained a request that\nFoundation’s attorney transmit the Letter to Board members.\n\n    At the Board meeting, copies of the Miller Nash Letter\nwere made available. Members of the press were in\nattendance. In a prepared statement to the Board, Dr. Cullinan\ndiscussed SOU’s need to act as a “good steward of public\nassets,” and expressed her hope for a mutually beneficial\noutcome. She stated in part:\n\n       While I continue to hope for a mutually\n       beneficial solution, I must be clear that, if the\n       board passes some of the resolutions before it\n       today, SOU must take prompt action to\n       protect the interests of [Public Radio], its\n       donors and the University. As you know, SOU\n       is a public university and has a legal\n       obligation to be a good steward of public\n       assets. In light of that obligation, we have\n       consulted external legal counsel about the\n       possible consequences of the actions before\n       the [Public Radio Foundation] board, and we\n       will follow the advice of counsel in taking\n       whatever action is warranted should these\n       resolutions pass. Our attorneys have drafted a\n       letter outlining the serious potential risks\n       associated with the proposed resolutions, and\n       they have asked the [Public Radio]\n       Foundation’s attorney to share that letter with\n       you all.\n\nDr. Cullinan urged SOU and Foundation to address their\nissues through mediation, rather than legal action. Still, she\nexpressed a belief that if the resolutions were passed, “and\n\f8                  KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nSOU is required to take protective legal action, this situation\nwill quickly move past the point where we can reach an\namicable resolution.”\n\n    After the Board rejected the proposed resolutions,\nFoundation and SOU engaged in mediation resulting in an\nagreement that was not approved by the Board.\n\n   The day following the Board meeting, Dr. Cullinan sent\nKramer a potential non-renewal notice (the March 23 Notice).\nThe March 23 Notice informed Kramer that his annual\nappointment with SOU “may not be renewed for the\nupcoming 2012-2013 fiscal year” and that his employment\nwith SOU “may terminate on June 30, 2012.”\n\n    On June 25, 2012, Dr. Cullinan informed Kramer that his\nappointment definitely would not be renewed (the June 25\nNon-Renewal). The non-renewal was without cause. Kramer\nchallenged the non-renewal of his appointment and received\na hearing before SOU’s Grievance Hearing Committee (the\nCommittee). Due to the equivocal phrasing of the March 23\nNotice, the Committee determined that Kramer had not\n“received proper notice of his non-renewal.” The Committee\nrecommended that Kramer be given 90 days’ salary and\nbenefits to remedy the insufficient notice, which Dr. Cullinan\napproved and SOU paid. The Committee also confirmed that\nSOU policy did not require any reason to be stated in a notice\nof non-renewal.\n\n    Following completion of the grievance procedures,\nKramer brought suit in federal district court against Dr.\nCullinan, Chancellor Pernsteiner, SOU, and the University\nSystem (collectively the Defendants), asserting various\nclaims related to his separation, including a civil rights claim\n\f                        KRAMER V. CULLINAN                                 9\n\nagainst Dr. Cullinan for deprivation of a liberty interest\nwithout due process of law.2 Defendants moved for summary\njudgment on all claims, including the state law claims, against\nDr. Cullinan and Chancellor Pernsteiner. In a well-reasoned\norder, the district court granted summary judgment in favor\nof Defendants on all claims, with the exception of the civil\nrights claim against Dr. Cullinan for deprivation of a liberty\ninterest without due process of law.3\n\n    Addressing Kramer’s liberty interest claim against Dr.\nCullinan, the district court concluded that the Miller Nash\nLetter contained stigmatizing charges against Kramer, that\nthe charges were made public, and that the charges were\nconnected to Kramer’s termination. The district court also\nheld that Kramer’s constitutional right was clearly\nestablished. This claim against Dr. Cullinan is the only issue\nremaining for resolution on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n    2\n       Kramer also alleged violation of his property interest without due\nprocess (against Dr. Cullinan), violation of equal protection under the\nFourteenth Amendment (against Chancellor Pernsteiner), and state law\nclaims of blacklisting (against SOU and Dr. Cullinan), tortious\ninterference with economic relations, breach of contract, and wage and\nhour violation.\n    3\n       The court concluded that Kramer “had no protected property\ninterest in his continued employment with SOU,” that “Pernsteiner’s\nactions did not constitute a violation of Kramer’s right to equal\nprotection,” that there was “no evidence . . . that Defendants acted with the\nmalicious intent to injure Kramer” through blacklisting, that Kramer was\nnot entitled to any further remedy under his contract because he “received\nninety days of pay and benefits,” and that the Grievance Committee’s\naward was not subject to Oregon’s wage collection statute.\n\f10                 KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n    Dr. Cullianan contends that she is entitled to qualified\nimmunity with respect to the claim that she “[v]iolated [n]o\nFourteenth Amendment [r]ight.” Specifically, Dr. Cullinan\nmaintains that the Miller Nash Letter contained no\nstigmatizing charges, that the Letter was not sent in the\ncourse of Kramer’s termination, and that the asserted\nconstitutional right was not clearly established at the time of\nthe alleged violation.\n\n    “We review a denial of qualified immunity de novo,\nviewing the facts and drawing reasonable inferences in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing summary\njudgment. . . . ” Ames v. King Cty., Wash., 846 F.3d 340, 347\n(9th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted).\n\n     To determine whether a public official is entitled to\nqualified immunity, we consider whether 1) the official\nviolated a constitutional right, and 2) the “right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the official’s alleged misconduct.”\nId. (citation omitted). It is within our discretion which prong\nto address first. See id.\n\nA) Whether Dr. Cullinan violated a constitutional right\n\n    The Fourteenth Amendment protects against deprivation\nof liberty and property interests without due process of law.\nSee K.W. ex rel. D.W v. Armstrong, 789 F.3d 962, 972 (9th\nCir. 2015). “A person’s liberty interest is implicated if the\ngovernment levels a charge against him that impairs his\nreputation for honesty or morality. . . . ” Guzman v. Shewry,\n552 F.3d 941, 955 (9th Cir. 2009), as amended (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). If the government, in the\n\f                      KRAMER V. CULLINAN                            11\n\ncourse of terminating a person’s employment, publicly\ndiscloses stigmatizing information, the employee is entitled\nto a “name-clearing hearing.” Cox v. Roskelley, 359 F.3d\n1105, 1110 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n    To establish that she “has a protected liberty interest at\nstake,” a plaintiff must demonstrate that: “(1) the accuracy of\nthe charge is contested, (2) there [was] some public disclosure\nof the charge, and (3) the charge [was] made in connection\nwith the termination of employment . . .” See Guzman,\n552 F.3d at 955 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).4\n\n    Whether a defendant’s statements rise to the level of\nstigmatizing a plaintiff is a question of fact. See Campanelli\nv. Bockrath, 100 F.3d 1476, 1480 (9th Cir. 1996). We have\npreviously held that charges made by an employer may be\nsufficiently stigmatizing to implicate an employee’s liberty\ninterest. See, e.g., Guzman, 552 F.3d at 946 (accusing\nemployee of fraudulently avowing that medical devices were\nFDA-approved); Campanelli, 100 F.3d at 1480 (charging\ncoach with “immoral conduct”); Vanelli v. Reynolds Sch.\nDist., 667 F.2d 773, 776–78 (9th Cir. 1982) (dismissing\nteacher for “offensive conduct”).\n\n    Here, the Miller Nash Letter explained that if Kramer’s\nproposed resolutions were approved by Foundation, SOU\nmight pursue legal redress. The Miller Nash Letter\nspecifically mentioned potential legal action against Kramer\nindividually for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the\n\n\n    4\n      We assume, without deciding, that the Miller Nash Letter was sent\nin the course of Kramer’s termination. It is undisputed that the other\nrequirements are met.\n\f12                 KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nStandards of Conduct for officers of Oregon nonprofit\ncorporations. The Letter also expressed that in the event the\nresolutions were passed, SOU did not “see a clear path\ntoward indemnity.” As discussed, it was in this context that\nthe language identified by Kramer as stigmatizing was\nused—identifying “actions taken in bad faith or through\nwillful misconduct” and noting that “intentional acts, waste\nor fraud” are generally excluded from coverage. The\ndifficulty with Kramer’s argument is that the Letter stopped\nfar short of actually imputing bad faith, willful misconduct,\nintentional acts, waste, or fraud to Kramer. Rather, the Letter\nstated that if the actions were later determined to constitute\nbad faith or willful misconduct, insurance coverage would not\nbe available. This statement is not analogous to the\naffirmative statements we have held to be stigmatizing. See,\ne.g., Guzman, 552 F.3d at 946; Campanelli, 100 F.3d at 1480;\nVanelli, 667 F.2d at 776–78.\n\n     In Tibbets v. Kulongoski, 567 F.3d 529, 530 (9th Cir.\n2009), former employees brought a § 1983 action against the\nGovernor of Oregon and other state actors alleging violation\nof their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The\nemployees maintained that the state made stigmatizing\nstatements about them in press releases without providing\nname-clearing hearings. See id. We reiterated that “a liberty\ninterest is implicated in the employment termination context\nif the charge impairs a reputation for honesty or morality.” Id.\nat 535 (citation omitted). We concluded that statements\nreferencing “strengthening accountability and transparency,”\n“ethics,” “honesty,” and “openness” were “more analogous to\ncases where honesty . . . has been implicated.” Id. at 537\n(alteration omitted).\n\f                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN                       13\n\n    In Cox, a terminated employee brought a § 1983 action\nalleging in part that county officials deprived him of his\nliberty interest in his good name. We focused our analysis on\nwhether placing a stigmatizing termination letter in an\nemployee’s personnel file sufficiently publicized the\nstigmatizing information. See 359 F.3d at 1109–12. We\naccepted as true Cox’s assertion that the notice of termination\nin his personnel file contained stigmatizing information,\nexplaining that “there is no doubt that the termination letter\ncharged improper conduct and could impair Cox’s reputation\nfor honesty or morality.” Id. at 1113.\n\n    The Miller Nash Letter stopped short of actually imputing\nto Kramer any bad faith, willful misconduct, intentional acts,\nwaste or fraud, and the Letter did not reference the type of\nstigmatizing statements we have held to be actionable, i.e.,\nthose accusing terminated employees of dishonesty,\nimmorality and the like. Viewing this evidence in the light\nmost favorable to Kramer, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s characterization of the Letter’s contents as\nstigmatizing was erroneous, and Dr. Cullinan was entitled to\nqualified immunity.\n\nB) Whether the asserted right was clearly established\n\n    Although we elected to first address the existence of a\nconstitutional violation, we would reach the same result had\nwe first examined whether the constitutional right asserted is\nclearly established. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223,\n236 (2009) (holding that courts may “exercise their sound\ndiscretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the\nqualified immunity analysis should be addressed first”).\n\f14                 KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\n    For a constitutional right to be “clearly established” its\n“contours [must be] sufficiently definite that any reasonable\nofficial in the defendant’s shoes would have understood that\nhe was violating it.” Plumhoff v. Richard, 134 S. Ct. 2012,\n2023 (2014). Although a case “directly on point” is not\nrequired for a right to be clearly established, “existing\nprecedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional\nquestion beyond debate.” White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551\n(2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). So\nlong as existing caselaw “did not preclude” an official from\nreasonably believing that his or her conduct was lawful, the\nofficial has a right to qualified immunity. Lane v. Franks,\n134 S. Ct. 2369, 2381 (2014).\n\n    To evaluate whether a particular question is beyond\ndebate, a court looks for “cases of controlling authority in\n[the plaintiff’s] jurisdiction at the time” or “a consensus of\ncases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer\ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.” Wilson\nv. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999). The plaintiff bears the\nburden of demonstrating that the right at issue was clearly\nestablished. See Alston v. Read, 663 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.\n2011).\n\n    By the time of Kramer’s termination, it was clearly\nestablished law that an employer charging an employee with\nfraud, dishonesty, or immorality is required under the\nFourteenth Amendment to afford that employee a name-\nclearing hearing. See Guzman, 552 F.3d at 955; Tibbetts,\n567 F.3d at 530; Campanelli, 100 F.3d at 1480. However, that\ngeneralized statement of the law was not sufficient to put Dr.\nCullinan on notice that her particular actions violated\nKramer’s constitutional rights. See Mitchell v. Washington,\n818 F.3d 436, 447 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that it is not\n\f                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN                       15\n\nenough “that the broad principle underlying a right is well-\nestablished”) (citation and alteration omitted). Accordingly,\nKramer’s reliance on Tibbets and Cox as “clearly\nestablishing” precedent is not persuasive. Those cases did not\ndefinitively place the question of whether the conditional\nlanguage in the Miller Nash letter was stigmatizing “beyond\ndebate.” Plumhoff, 134 S. Ct. at 2023. Indeed, as discussed,\nthe language in the Letter is not similar to phrasing that we\nhave found to be stigmatizing.\n\n    The district court failed to identify, the parties have not\ncited, and we have not found a case where conditional\nlanguage was determined to be stigmatizing. Neither has a\ncase been referenced that found stigmatization in the absence\nof a charge of fraud, dishonesty, or immoral conduct. In this\ncircumstance, Kramer has failed to place the stigmatizing\nnature of the Letter “beyond debate.” White, 137 S. Ct. at\n551; see also Alston, 663 F.3d at 1098 (placing this burden on\nthe plaintiff). Reliance on the broad principles espoused in\nTibbets and similar cases clearly establishing the stigmatizing\nnature of charges of fraud, dishonesty, or immorality does not\nplace the question in this case “beyond debate” because the\nLetter did not charge Kramer with fraud, dishonesty or\nimmorality. At worst, the Letter could plausibly be read to\nimply a breach of fiduciary duty. But no precedent has been\nbrought to our attention clearly establishing a charge of\nbreach of fiduciary duty as stigmatizing.\n\n    The Supreme Court has cautioned us against defining\nclearly established law “at a high level of generality.” White,\n137 S. Ct. at 552. In White, the Supreme Court overruled a\ndecision of the Tenth Circuit denying qualified immunity\nwhere “it failed to identify a case where an officer acting\nunder similar circumstances . . . was held to have violated the\n\f16                  KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nFourth Amendment.” Id. at 550, 552. The Supreme Court\nreiterated that “the clearly established law must be\nparticularized to the facts of the case.” Id. at 552 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). There is simply no clearly\nestablished law “particularized to the [unique] facts of [this]\ncase.” Id. This is not a case where the stigmatizing nature of\nthe charge is obvious as in Guzman, 552 F.3d at 946 (fraud),\nor Tibbets, 567 F.3d at 530 (dishonesty), or Campanelli, 100\nF.3d at 1480 (immorality), or Vanelli, 667 F.2d at 776–78\n(“offensive conduct”). Dr. Cullinan’s conduct did not\nconstitute such a run-of-the-mill Fourteenth Amendment\nviolation. Instead, this case lacks an explicit charge of fraud,\ndishonesty, or immorality, militating against a conclusion that\nDr. Cullinan’s actions violated a “clearly established” right.\nWhite, 137 S. Ct at 552.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n    Dr. Cullinan was entitled to qualified immunity. The\nMiller Nash Letter did not contain stigmatizing content, and\neven if the content were stigmatizing, it was not clearly\nestablished law that charges other than fraud, dishonesty, and\nimmorality would trigger the requirements of a name-clearing\nhearing. The district court decision denying qualified\nimmunity to Dr. Cullinan is reversed, and the case is\nremanded to the district court with directions to enter\nsummary judgment in favor of Dr. Cullinan.\n\n     REVERSED and REMANDED with directions.\n\f",

Viewing this evidence in\nthe light most favorable to Kramer, the panel concluded that\nthe district court’s characterization of the letter’s contents as\nstigmatizing was erroneous, and that Dr. Cullinan was\nentitled to qualified immunity. The panel further held that\neven if the content were stigmatizing, it was not clearly\nestablished law that charges other than fraud, dishonesty, and\nimmorality would trigger the requirements of a name-clearing\nhearing.

Because it is unlikely that the\ninformation released was stigmatizing, and because it was not\nclearly established as a matter of law that the information was\nstigmatizing, Dr. Cullinan was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n     SOU employed Kramer on an annual appointment basis\nin a dual role, as Executive Director of Jefferson Public Radio\n\f4                     KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\n(Public Radio) and as Executive Director of a related\nfoundation, the JPR Foundation, Inc. (Foundation). Kramer\nreported directly to Dr. Cullinan.\n\n    At some point, Dr. Cullinan became concerned about\ncostly capital projects being undertaken by Foundation, such\nas the acquisition and renovation of a theater and a\nwarehouse. Dr. Cullinan notified Foundation and the Oregon\nUniversity System (University System) Chancellor\n(Chancellor Pernsteiner), of the potential financial risk to\nSOU as a result of Foundation’s projects. Dr. Cullinan also\nraised the issue of conflict-of-interest situations between\nPublic Radio and Foundation.\n\n    In response to Dr. Cullinan’s concerns, Chancellor\nPernsteiner initiated an asset and liability review of Public\nRadio and Foundation. The resulting report (Audit Report)\nconcluded that Foundation’s new projects could impose\n“additional strain” on community fund-raising and “may not\nalign with policy interests of SOU.” The Audit Report also\nnoted inherent problems, including actual, apparent, and\npotential conflicts of interest with Kramer serving as\nExecutive Director of both Public Radio and Foundation. One\nconsequence of that arrangement was “a lack of segregation\nof duties by the Executive Director of [Public Radio] when\nentering into contracts,” which was a conflict of interest\nbecause “one individual cannot adequately represent the\ninterests of two separate parties to the same agreement or\ncontract.” The Audit Report determined that this situation\nwas contrary to SOU’s contract policy.1\n\n\n    1\n         Additionally, Oregon Administrative Rule 580-046-0025(2)\nprovided that a foundation’s governing body, employees, and agents\n“[s]hall not be subject to control by the institution or an institution\n\f                       KRAMER V. CULLINAN                               5\n\n    The Audit Report concluded that there was high internal\ncontrol risk regarding the key areas examined. The report\nincluded recommendations to reduce those risks, including\nprohibiting one person from serving as Executive Director of\nboth Public Radio and Foundation. In response, Dr. Cullinan\nagreed to address the concerns raised by the Audit Report and\neliminate the conflict of interest posed by Kramer’s dual\nroles. Dr. Cullinan convened a task force to address\nimplementation of the recommendations in the Audit Report.\n\n    Kramer resisted limiting his employment to one role, and\ninsisted that it was crucial to Public Radio and Foundation\nthat he continue serving as Executive Director of both\nentities. The task force completed its work, but no\nrecommended resolution of the conflict presented by\nKramer’s dual roles was presented to Dr. Cullinan.\n\n     In the meantime, Kramer launched a counteroffensive,\ndrafting and distributing proposed resolutions to the\nFoundation Board (Board). The resolutions would have\ndramatically altered the relationship between SOU and\nFoundation, deprived SOU of assets, and secured Kramer’s\nposition at Foundation. The resolutions were to be voted upon\nat the Board meeting scheduled for March 22, 2012.\n\n    Upon learning of Kramer’s proposed resolutions, Dr.\nCullinan sought the advice of counsel, who sent a letter\n(Miller Nash Letter) to Foundation’s attorney, dated the same\nday as the scheduled board meeting. The Miller Nash Letter\nincluded a copy of the Audit Report and highlighted the\nrecommendation that SOU eliminate the conflict of interest\n\n\nemployee” and “[s]hall not give the appearance that the institution or any\nof its officers or employees control the foundation or its property.”\n\f6                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\npresented by Kramer’s dual role. The Miller Nash Letter\ninformed Foundation that SOU considered Kramer’s\nproposed resolutions counterproductive, and requested that\nFoundation’s Board not adopt the proposed resolutions. The\nLetter also outlined potential avenues of legal redress against\nFoundation, its Board, and/or Kramer, to protect SOU’s rights\nin Public Radio and its assets.\n\n     The Miller Nash Letter also addressed the directors’ and\nKramer’s potential liability, outlining reasons why they might\nnot be protected by directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\nIt is this portion of the Miller Nash Letter that precipitated\nKramer’s claim of stigmatization. In the course of explaining\nwhy indemnification might not be available to Kramer or\nFoundation’s directors, the Miller Nash Letter opined that\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability policies generally “exclude\ncoverage for intentional acts, waste, or fraud.” The Miller\nNash Letter contained the following language that Kramer\nalso identified as stigmatizing:\n\n        Nor do we see a clear path to indemnity.\n        Article X of the bylaws forbids\n        indemnification for actions taken in bad faith\n        or through willful misconduct. If any actions\n        of Mr. Kramer or the Foundation’s directors\n        (including past actions and the adoption of the\n        Proposed Resolutions) are determined to have\n        been made in bad faith or through willful\n        misconduct, neither Mr. Kramer nor the\n        Foundation’s directors will be entitled to\n        indemnification, and they are unlikely to be\n        entitled to protection under any directors’ and\n        officers’ liability insurance.\n\f                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN                       7\n\nThe Miller Nash Letter also contained a request that\nFoundation’s attorney transmit the Letter to Board members.\n\n    At the Board meeting, copies of the Miller Nash Letter\nwere made available. Members of the press were in\nattendance. In a prepared statement to the Board, Dr. Cullinan\ndiscussed SOU’s need to act as a “good steward of public\nassets,” and expressed her hope for a mutually beneficial\noutcome. She stated in part:\n\n       While I continue to hope for a mutually\n       beneficial solution, I must be clear that, if the\n       board passes some of the resolutions before it\n       today, SOU must take prompt action to\n       protect the interests of [Public Radio], its\n       donors and the University. As you know, SOU\n       is a public university and has a legal\n       obligation to be a good steward of public\n       assets. In light of that obligation, we have\n       consulted external legal counsel about the\n       possible consequences of the actions before\n       the [Public Radio Foundation] board, and we\n       will follow the advice of counsel in taking\n       whatever action is warranted should these\n       resolutions pass. Our attorneys have drafted a\n       letter outlining the serious potential risks\n       associated with the proposed resolutions, and\n       they have asked the [Public Radio]\n       Foundation’s attorney to share that letter with\n       you all.\n\nDr. Cullinan urged SOU and Foundation to address their\nissues through mediation, rather than legal action. Still, she\nexpressed a belief that if the resolutions were passed, “and\n\f8                  KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nSOU is required to take protective legal action, this situation\nwill quickly move past the point where we can reach an\namicable resolution.”\n\n    After the Board rejected the proposed resolutions,\nFoundation and SOU engaged in mediation resulting in an\nagreement that was not approved by the Board.\n\n   The day following the Board meeting, Dr. Cullinan sent\nKramer a potential non-renewal notice (the March 23 Notice).\nThe March 23 Notice informed Kramer that his annual\nappointment with SOU “may not be renewed for the\nupcoming 2012-2013 fiscal year” and that his employment\nwith SOU “may terminate on June 30, 2012.”\n\n    On June 25, 2012, Dr. Cullinan informed Kramer that his\nappointment definitely would not be renewed (the June 25\nNon-Renewal). The non-renewal was without cause. Kramer\nchallenged the non-renewal of his appointment and received\na hearing before SOU’s Grievance Hearing Committee (the\nCommittee). Due to the equivocal phrasing of the March 23\nNotice, the Committee determined that Kramer had not\n“received proper notice of his non-renewal.” The Committee\nrecommended that Kramer be given 90 days’ salary and\nbenefits to remedy the insufficient notice, which Dr. Cullinan\napproved and SOU paid. The Committee also confirmed that\nSOU policy did not require any reason to be stated in a notice\nof non-renewal.\n\n    Following completion of the grievance procedures,\nKramer brought suit in federal district court against Dr.\nCullinan, Chancellor Pernsteiner, SOU, and the University\nSystem (collectively the Defendants), asserting various\nclaims related to his separation, including a civil rights claim\n\f                        KRAMER V. CULLINAN                                 9\n\nagainst Dr. Cullinan for deprivation of a liberty interest\nwithout due process of law.2 Defendants moved for summary\njudgment on all claims, including the state law claims, against\nDr. Cullinan and Chancellor Pernsteiner. In a well-reasoned\norder, the district court granted summary judgment in favor\nof Defendants on all claims, with the exception of the civil\nrights claim against Dr. Cullinan for deprivation of a liberty\ninterest without due process of law.3\n\n    Addressing Kramer’s liberty interest claim against Dr.\nCullinan, the district court concluded that the Miller Nash\nLetter contained stigmatizing charges against Kramer, that\nthe charges were made public, and that the charges were\nconnected to Kramer’s termination. The district court also\nheld that Kramer’s constitutional right was clearly\nestablished. This claim against Dr. Cullinan is the only issue\nremaining for resolution on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n    2\n       Kramer also alleged violation of his property interest without due\nprocess (against Dr. Cullinan), violation of equal protection under the\nFourteenth Amendment (against Chancellor Pernsteiner), and state law\nclaims of blacklisting (against SOU and Dr. Cullinan), tortious\ninterference with economic relations, breach of contract, and wage and\nhour violation.\n    3\n       The court concluded that Kramer “had no protected property\ninterest in his continued employment with SOU,” that “Pernsteiner’s\nactions did not constitute a violation of Kramer’s right to equal\nprotection,” that there was “no evidence . . . that Defendants acted with the\nmalicious intent to injure Kramer” through blacklisting, that Kramer was\nnot entitled to any further remedy under his contract because he “received\nninety days of pay and benefits,” and that the Grievance Committee’s\naward was not subject to Oregon’s wage collection statute.\n\f10                 KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n    Dr. Cullianan contends that she is entitled to qualified\nimmunity with respect to the claim that she “[v]iolated [n]o\nFourteenth Amendment [r]ight.” Specifically, Dr. Cullinan\nmaintains that the Miller Nash Letter contained no\nstigmatizing charges, that the Letter was not sent in the\ncourse of Kramer’s termination, and that the asserted\nconstitutional right was not clearly established at the time of\nthe alleged violation.\n\n    “We review a denial of qualified immunity de novo,\nviewing the facts and drawing reasonable inferences in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing summary\njudgment. . . . ” Ames v.

The Letter also expressed that in the event the\nresolutions were passed, SOU did not “see a clear path\ntoward indemnity.” As discussed, it was in this context that\nthe language identified by Kramer as stigmatizing was\nused—identifying “actions taken in bad faith or through\nwillful misconduct” and noting that “intentional acts, waste\nor fraud” are generally excluded from coverage. The\ndifficulty with Kramer’s argument is that the Letter stopped\nfar short of actually imputing bad faith, willful misconduct,\nintentional acts, waste, or fraud to Kramer. Rather, the Letter\nstated that if the actions were later determined to constitute\nbad faith or willful misconduct, insurance coverage would not\nbe available. This statement is not analogous to the\naffirmative statements we have held to be stigmatizing.

We reiterated that “a liberty\ninterest is implicated in the employment termination context\nif the charge impairs a reputation for honesty or morality.” Id.\nat 535 (citation omitted). We concluded that statements\nreferencing “strengthening accountability and transparency,”\n“ethics,” “honesty,” and “openness” were “more analogous to\ncases where honesty . . . has been implicated.” Id. at 537\n(alteration omitted).\n\f                   KRAMER V.

We focused our analysis on\nwhether placing a stigmatizing termination letter in an\nemployee’s personnel file sufficiently publicized the\nstigmatizing information. See 359 F.3d at 1109–12. We\naccepted as true Cox’s assertion that the notice of termination\nin his personnel file contained stigmatizing information,\nexplaining that “there is no doubt that the termination letter\ncharged improper conduct and could impair Cox’s reputation\nfor honesty or morality.” Id. at 1113.\n\n    The Miller Nash Letter stopped short of actually imputing\nto Kramer any bad faith, willful misconduct, intentional acts,\nwaste or fraud, and the Letter did not reference the type of\nstigmatizing statements we have held to be actionable, i.e.,\nthose accusing terminated employees of dishonesty,\nimmorality and the like. Viewing this evidence in the light\nmost favorable to Kramer, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s characterization of the Letter’s contents as\nstigmatizing was erroneous, and Dr. Cullinan was entitled to\nqualified immunity.\n\nB) Whether the asserted right was clearly established\n\n    Although we elected to first address the existence of a\nconstitutional violation, we would reach the same result had\nwe first examined whether the constitutional right asserted is\nclearly established.

Richard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2675750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2675750/plumhoff-v-rickard/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although a case “directly on point” is not\nrequired for a right to be clearly established, “existing\nprecedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional\nquestion beyond debate.” White v. Pauly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551\n(2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). So\nlong as existing caselaw “did not preclude” an official from\nreasonably believing that his or her conduct was lawful, the\nofficial has a right to qualified immunity. Lane v. Franks,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679557/lane-v-franks/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2381 (2014).\n\n    To evaluate whether a particular question is beyond\ndebate, a court looks for “cases of controlling authority in\n[the plaintiff’s] jurisdiction at the time” or “a consensus of\ncases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer\ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.” Wilson\nv. Layne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617 (1999). The plaintiff bears the\nburden of demonstrating that the right at issue was clearly\nestablished. See Alston v. Read, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618859\"><a href=\"/opinion/618859/alston-v-read/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (9th Cir.\n2011).\n\n    By the time of Kramer’s termination, it was clearly\nestablished law that an employer charging an employee with\nfraud, dishonesty, or immorality is required under the\nFourteenth Amendment to afford that employee a name-\nclearing hearing. See Guzman, 552 F.3d at 955; Tibbetts,\n567 F.3d at 530; Campanelli, 100 F.3d at 1480. However, that\ngeneralized statement of the law was not sufficient to put Dr.\nCullinan on notice that her particular actions violated\nKramer’s constitutional rights. See Mitchell v. Washington,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that it is not\n\f                   KRAMER V. CULLINAN                       15\n\nenough “that the broad principle underlying a right is well-\nestablished”) (citation and alteration omitted). Accordingly,\nKramer’s reliance on Tibbets and Cox as “clearly\nestablishing” precedent is not persuasive. Those cases did not\ndefinitively place the question of whether the conditional\nlanguage in the Miller Nash letter was stigmatizing “beyond\ndebate.” Plumhoff, 134 S. Ct. at 2023. Indeed, as discussed,\nthe language in the Letter is not similar to phrasing that we\nhave found to be stigmatizing.\n\n    The district court failed to identify, the parties have not\ncited, and we have not found a case where conditional\nlanguage was determined to be stigmatizing. Neither has a\ncase been referenced that found stigmatization in the absence\nof a charge of fraud, dishonesty, or immoral conduct. In this\ncircumstance, Kramer has failed to place the stigmatizing\nnature of the Letter “beyond debate.” White, 137 S. Ct. at\n551; see also Alston, 663 F.3d at 1098 (placing this burden on\nthe plaintiff). Reliance on the broad principles espoused in\nTibbets and similar cases clearly establishing the stigmatizing\nnature of charges of fraud, dishonesty, or immorality does not\nplace the question in this case “beyond debate” because the\nLetter did not charge Kramer with fraud, dishonesty or\nimmorality. At worst, the Letter could plausibly be read to\nimply a breach of fiduciary duty. But no precedent has been\nbrought to our attention clearly establishing a charge of\nbreach of fiduciary duty as stigmatizing.\n\n    The Supreme Court has cautioned us against defining\nclearly established law “at a high level of generality.” White,\n137 S. Ct. at 552. In White, the Supreme Court overruled a\ndecision of the Tenth Circuit denying qualified immunity\nwhere “it failed to identify a case where an officer acting\nunder similar circumstances . . . was held to have violated the\n\f16                  KRAMER V. CULLINAN\n\nFourth Amendment.” Id. at 550, 552. The Supreme Court\nreiterated that “the clearly established law must be\nparticularized to the facts of the case.” Id. at 552 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). There is simply no clearly\nestablished law “particularized to the [unique] facts of [this]\ncase.” Id. This is not a case where the stigmatizing nature of\nthe charge is obvious as in Guzman, 552 F.3d at 946 (fraud),\nor Tibbets, 567 F.3d at 530 (dishonesty), or Campanelli, 100\nF.3d at 1480 (immorality), or Vanelli, 667 F.2d at 776–78\n(“offensive conduct”). Dr. Cullinan’s conduct did not\nconstitute such a run-of-the-mill Fourteenth Amendment\nviolation. Instead, this case lacks an explicit charge of fraud,\ndishonesty, or immorality, militating against a conclusion that\nDr. Cullinan’s actions violated a “clearly established” right.\nWhite, 137 S. Ct at 552.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n    Dr. Cullinan was entitled to qualified immunity. The\nMiller Nash Letter did not contain stigmatizing content, and\neven if the content were stigmatizing, it was not clearly\nestablished law that charges other than fraud, dishonesty, and\nimmorality would trigger the requirements of a name-clearing\nhearing. The district court decision denying qualified\nimmunity to Dr. Cullinan is reversed, and the case is\nremanded to the district court with directions to enter\nsummary judgment in favor of Dr. Cullinan.\n\n     REVERSED and REMANDED with directions.\n\f</pre>",
