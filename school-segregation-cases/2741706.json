State</i>, 951 S.W.2d 856, 863\r\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 1997, pet. ref'd);<i> Pena v. State</i>, 864 S.W.2d 147, 152 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Waco 1993, no pet.) (op. on reh'g); <i>Coleman v. State</i>, 833 S.W.2d 286, 289 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, pet. ref'd).<i><span>        </span></i></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The officer who found the drugs in Meitler's automobile explained how he found the\r\ndrugs, how he packaged the drugs in an envelope sealed with evidence tape, dated and\r\nsigned the package and turned it in at the station.  The officer then identified the packaging\r\nas his, along with his signature and date.  Officer Steve Tigert, the custodian of the\r\nevidence, testified about drug task force policies on maintaining evidence in a locker, and\r\nexplained how he kept them segregated and stored, and also explained how he matched\r\nthe evidence listed on the incoming property sheet with the actual items delivered.  He also\r\ntestified he was the person who submitted the evidence to the laboratory for examination. \r\nFinally, Drew Fout, a representative of the Texas Department of Public Safety Crime\r\nLaboratory, testified regarding the internal procedures used to create a paper trail for the\r\nreceipt of evidence and for the analysis of the items delivered.  Fout testified he had\r\nopened, examined, and repackaged the evidence, and retained it in the vault at the\r\nlaboratory until he brought it to court.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The evidence supports the court's conclusion that the matter in question is what its\r\nproponent claimed.  In light of this evidence, and in the absence of any evidence of\r\ntampering or any other matter that would cast doubt on its authenticity, we conclude the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling the objection.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Meitler next contends the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial, after the\r\nprosecutor intentionally violated the terms of an order on a motion in limine by questioning\r\nhim about a search of his residence by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency.  The order\r\nhad granted Meitler's motion restricting the prosecutor from mentioning extraneous\r\noffenses or prior convictions at trial.  Thus, it appears that the question may have exceeded\r\nthe bounds of the order.  However, there are procedural problems with the preservation of\r\nthis alleged error.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>First, counsel objected, and eventually asked for a mistrial, but did not ask for an\r\ninstruction to disregard.  The asking of an improper question will seldom result in a mistrial\r\nbecause, in most cases, any harm can be cured by an instruction to disregard. <i>Ladd v.\r\nState</i>, 3 S.W.3d 547, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Thus, testimony referring to or implying\r\nextraneous offenses allegedly committed by a defendant may be rendered harmless by the\r\ntrial court's instruction to disregard.  <i>Campos v. State</i>,<i> </i>589 S.W.2d 424, 428 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. [Panel Op.] 1979).  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>A mistrial is required only when the improper question is clearly prejudicial to the\r\ndefendant and is of such character as to suggest the impossibility of withdrawing the\r\nimpression produced on the minds of the jurors.  <i>Id.</i>  A trial court's denial of a mistrial is\r\nreviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <i> Id.</i>;<i> State v. Gonzalez</i>, 855 S.W.2d 692,\r\n696 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In this case, the mention of a search by a drug agency is inherently prejudicial to the\r\ndefendant.  However, we are not prepared to say that it is of such a prejudicial nature that\r\na proper instruction would not have rendered the error harmless, and thus the trial court's\r\ndecision to deny the motion for mistrial was not such as to constitute an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  The contention of error is overruled.<span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We affirm the judgment.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                                           </span>Donald R.

State</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372622\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372622/coleman-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 289 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, pet. ref'd).<i><span>        </span></i></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The officer who found the drugs in Meitler's automobile explained how he found the\r\ndrugs, how he packaged the drugs in an envelope sealed with evidence tape, dated and\r\nsigned the package and turned it in at the station.  The officer then identified the packaging\r\nas his, along with his signature and date.  Officer Steve Tigert, the custodian of the\r\nevidence, testified about drug task force policies on maintaining evidence in a locker, and\r\nexplained how he kept them segregated and stored, and also explained how he matched\r\nthe evidence listed on the incoming property sheet with the actual items delivered.  He also\r\ntestified he was the person who submitted the evidence to the laboratory for examination. \r\nFinally, Drew Fout, a representative of the Texas Department of Public Safety Crime\r\nLaboratory, testified regarding the internal procedures used to create a paper trail for the\r\nreceipt of evidence and for the analysis of the items delivered.  Fout testified he had\r\nopened, examined, and repackaged the evidence, and retained it in the vault at the\r\nlaboratory until he brought it to court.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The evidence supports the court's conclusion that the matter in question is what its\r\nproponent claimed.  In light of this evidence, and in the absence of any evidence of\r\ntampering or any other matter that would cast doubt on its authenticity, we conclude the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling the objection.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Meitler next contends the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial, after the\r\nprosecutor intentionally violated the terms of an order on a motion in limine by questioning\r\nhim about a search of his residence by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency.  The order\r\nhad granted Meitler's motion restricting the prosecutor from mentioning extraneous\r\noffenses or prior convictions at trial.  Thus, it appears that the question may have exceeded\r\nthe bounds of the order.  However, there are procedural problems with the preservation of\r\nthis alleged error.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>First, counsel objected, and eventually asked for a mistrial, but did not ask for an\r\ninstruction to disregard.  The asking of an improper question will seldom result in a mistrial\r\nbecause, in most cases, any harm can be cured by an instruction to disregard. <i>Ladd v.\r\nState</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773413/ladd-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Thus, testimony referring to or implying\r\nextraneous offenses allegedly committed by a defendant may be rendered harmless by the\r\ntrial court's instruction to disregard.  <i>Campos v. State</i>,<i> </i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1571451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1571451/campos-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 428 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. [Panel Op.] 1979).  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>A mistrial is required only when the improper question is clearly prejudicial to the\r\ndefendant and is of such character as to suggest the impossibility of withdrawing the\r\nimpression produced on the minds of the jurors.  <i>Id.</i>  A trial court's denial of a mistrial is\r\nreviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <i> Id.</i>;<i> State v. Gonzalez</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1669213\"><a href=\"/opinion/1669213/state-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>,\r\n696 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In this case, the mention of a search by a drug agency is inherently prejudicial to the\r\ndefendant.  However, we are not prepared to say that it is of such a prejudicial nature that\r\na proper instruction would not have rendered the error harmless, and thus the trial court's\r\ndecision to deny the motion for mistrial was not such as to constitute an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  The contention of error is overruled.<span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We affirm the judgment.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                                           </span>Donald R.
