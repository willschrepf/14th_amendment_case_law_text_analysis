After nearly thirty\n\nyears of litigation, a settlement agreement has been reached\n\nbetween the Private Plaintiffs, the United States (which\n\nintervened in this action in support of the Private Plaintiffs),\n\nand the State of Mississippi.   Among other obligations, the\n\nagreement promises approximately $500 million in funding over\n\nseventeen years to remedy the present effects of Mississippi’s\n\npast policies of de jure segregation.     After conducting a hearing\n\non the fairness of the proposed settlement agreement and\n\nreceiving a concurrent resolution from the Mississippi\n\nLegislature supporting the proposal and agreeing to fund it, the\n\ndistrict court approved the settlement.\n\n     Dissatisfied with the relief provided for in the agreement,\n\n                                  2\n\fseveral of the Private Plaintiffs (“Appellants”) appeal to this\n\ncourt, asking us to reverse the district court’s decision and,\n\nthereby, to invalidate the settlement.       Appellants also desire to\n\nopt out of this class action and, thus, to continue litigating\n\nthis controversy.   Finally, Appellants’ attorney, who represented\n\nthe Private-Plaintiff class for many years, contends that he must\n\nbe permitted to proceed separately regarding his fees, even\n\nthough the settlement agreement provides a lump sum for the fees\n\nof all the attorneys who have represented the Private Plaintiffs.\n\n     We have reviewed Appellants’ objections to the settlement\n\nagreement, and we hold that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in approving it.    In addition, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court correctly denied Appellants’ motion to opt out of\n\nthe Private-Plaintiff class.    Finally, we reject the assertion of\n\nAppellants’ attorney that he is entitled to proceed separately\n\nregarding attorneys’ fees.    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                             I. Background\n\nA.   Procedural History1\n\n\n\n     1\n          The procedural history of this litigation has been\nchronicled in several prior court opinions. Except to the extent\nthat it is relevant to this appeal, we do not repeat that history\nhere. For proceedings regarding the first trial in this case,\nsee Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523 (N.D. Miss. 1987); Ayers\nv. Allain, 893 F.2d 732 (5th Cir. 1990); Ayers v. Allain, 914\nF.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1990) (en banc); United States v. Fordice, 505\nU.S. 717 (1992). For proceedings concerning the second trial,\nsee Ayers v. Fordice, 879 F. Supp. 1419 (N.D. Miss. 1995); Ayers\nv. Fordice, 111 F.3d 1183 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                   3\n\f     1.     Proceedings Through the First Appeal\n\n     The Private Plaintiffs2 filed suit against, among others,\n\nthe Governor of Mississippi and the Board of Trustees of State\n\nInstitutions of Higher Learning (“the Board”).     The United States\n\nsubsequently intervened as a plaintiff.    In their complaints, the\n\nPrivate Plaintiffs and the United States alleged, inter alia,\n\nthat the Defendants had not satisfied their affirmative\n\nobligation under the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI to\n\ndisestablish the State’s racially dual system of higher\n\neducation.3    After conducting a trial, the district court ruled\n\nthat the State——by adopting race-neutral policies and procedures\n\nand taking certain affirmative actions——had satisfied its duty to\n\nreform the former de jure segregated state-university system.\n\nAyers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1564 (N.D. Miss. 1987).    We\n\naffirmed.     Ayers v. Allain, 914 F.2d 676, 692 (5th Cir. 1990) (en\n\n\n     2\n          In September 1975, the district court certified, under\nRule 23(b)(2), the following class:\n     [A]ll black citizens residing in Mississippi, whether\n     students, former students, parents, employees, or\n     taxpayers, who have been, are, or will be discriminated\n     against on account of race in receiving equal educational\n     opportunity and/or equal employment opportunity in the\n     universities operated by [the] Board . . . .\n     3\n          Mississippi’s state-university system consists of eight\nschools——five historically white universities and three\nhistorically black universities. The historically white\nuniversities are the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State\nUniversity, Mississippi University for Women, the University of\nSouthern Mississippi, and Delta State University. The\nhistorically black universities are Jackson State University,\nMississippi Valley State University, and Alcorn State University.\n\n                                   4\n\fbanc).\n\n     2.   The Supreme Court’s Decision\n\n     Reversing, the Supreme Court held that both this court and\n\nthe district court had applied an incorrect legal standard.      See\n\nUnited States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 729-32 (1992).    According\n\nto the Court’s opinion,\n\n     If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable\n     to its prior system that continue to have segregative\n     effects——whether by influencing student enrollment\n     decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of\n     the university system——and such policies are without\n     sound educational justification and can be practicably\n     eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of\n     proving that it has dismantled its prior system. Such\n     policies run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause, even\n     though the State has abolished the legal requirement that\n     whites and blacks be educated separately and has\n     established racially neutral policies not animated by a\n     discriminatory purpose.\n\nId. at 731-32.   In other words, the Court ruled that the Equal\n\nProtection Clause and Title VI4 require Mississippi to abolish\n\nany policy or practice that (1) is traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation, (2) continues to have segregative effects, (3) is\n\nwithout sound educational justification, and (4) can be\n\npracticably eliminated.\n\n     Having articulated the legal standard to be applied on\n\nremand, the Court closed with an important clarification:\n\n\n\n     4\n          The Supreme Court opined that “the reach of Title VI’s\nprotection extends no further than the Fourteenth Amendment,”\nthereby obviating the need to engage in distinct analyses.\nFordice, 505 U.S. at 732 n.7; accord Ayers, 111 F.3d at 1191 n.5.\n\n                                 5\n\f     If we understand [the Private Plaintiffs] to press us to\n     order the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and\n     Mississippi Valley State solely so that they may be\n     publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by private\n     choice, we reject that request. The State provides these\n     facilities for all its citizens and it has not met its\n     burden under Brown to take affirmative steps to dismantle\n     its prior de jure system . . . .\n\nId. at 743.   Thus, the Court affirmed that this litigation\n\nconcerns eliminating the effects of prior legal segregation, not\n\nmandating equality among Mississippi’s publicly funded\n\neducational institutions.   Cf. Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,\n\n305 U.S. 337, 351 (1938) (explaining that the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment guarantees to individuals the equal protection of the\n\nlaws).\n\n     3.   The Second Trial and the Remedial Order\n\n     On remand, the district court applied the legal standard\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court and found vestiges of\n\nsegregation with continued segregative effects in several areas\n\nof Mississippi’s higher-education system.      See Ayers v. Fordice,\n\n879 F. Supp. 1419, 1477 (N.D. Miss. 1995).     To reform these\n\nareas, consistent with the Supreme Court’s emphasis on\n\neducational soundness and practicability, the district court\n\nissued a remedial decree, id. at 1494-96, and it ordered the\n\nestablishment of a three-person committee to monitor the\n\nimplementation of its decree.   Id. at 1494.    We describe below\n\nonly those provisions of the decree that bear on this appeal.\n\n     Regarding admissions standards, the court accepted the\n\n                                 6\n\fBoard’s proposed admissions policy, which remains in place today.\n\nId. at 1494 (accepting the Board’s proposed admissions policy);\n\nid. at 1477-79 (describing that policy).      Previously, admissions\n\nstandards were stricter at the historically white universities\n\nthan at the historically black universities, and the standards\n\nwere based almost exclusively on an applicant’s performance on\n\nthe American College Test (ACT).       See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734-\n\n35.   The prior admissions standards were a vestige of de jure\n\nsegregation that continued to have segregative effects: Because\n\nAfrican-American applicants as a class scored lower on the ACT\n\nthan white applicants, the standards effectively channeled black\n\nstudents to the historically black universities.         See Fordice,\n\n505 U.S. at 734-35.   Under the Board’s current policy, however,\n\nuniform standards govern admission to all of the State’s\n\nuniversities.   Ayers, 879 F. Supp. at 1477-78.     Also, rather than\n\nbeing based almost entirely on ACT scores, the current admissions\n\nstandards also take into account high school grades.         Id.\n\nFurther, applicants who do not meet the regular admissions\n\ncriteria can still gain admission through completion of a spring\n\nscreening process, which for some students leads to participation\n\nin a summer remedial program and further remedial instruction\n\nduring the regular academic year.      Id. at 1478-79.\n\n      The decree directed the implementation of the Board’s\n\nproposals for the development of additional academic programs at\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fJackson State, including programs in the field of allied health\n\nand graduate degrees in social work, urban planning, and\n\nbusiness.   Id. at 1494.   The court further instructed the Board\n\nto conduct an institutional study of Jackson State, involving\n\nexamination of the feasibility and educational soundness of\n\nproviding additional academic offerings there, such as an\n\nengineering school, a law school, and a pharmacy program.     Id. at\n\n1494-95.    Regarding Alcorn State, the district court ordered the\n\nestablishment of an MBA program at the school’s Natchez Center.\n\nId.   Additionally, the court ordered the Board to study whether\n\ndesegregation in the two state universities in the Mississippi\n\nDelta region——Delta State and Mississippi Valley State——could\n\nonly be achieved through consolidating the two institutions.       Id.\n\n      The remedial decree also directed the State to submit to the\n\nmonitoring committee a report addressing the practicability of\n\nhaving the State assume control over the facilities-maintenance\n\nfunds then controlled individually by each of the eight state\n\nuniversities.    Id.   The district court further instructed the\n\nBoard “to study the feasibility of establishing system-wide\n\ncoordination of the community colleges in the State in the areas\n\nof admissions standards and articulation procedures, and report\n\nto the Monitoring Committee” regarding its findings.5    Id. at\n\n\n      5\n          Although a separate lawsuit was underway regarding\nMississippi’s community-college system, the district court issued\nthese directions respecting the community colleges because\n\n                                   8\n\f1496.\n\n     4.   This Court’s 1997 Opinion\n\n     On appeal, while upholding most of the district court’s\n\ndecision, this court rejected a few of its conclusions, and we\n\nset forth several instructions to be followed on remand.    We\n\nfocus here only on those aspects of our 1997 opinion that are\n\nrelevant to this appeal.   We concluded that the district court\n\nerred in finding that the use of ACT cutoffs to award\n\nscholarships was not traceable to the de jure system and that\n\nthis policy did not continue to foster segregation.     Ayers v.\n\nFordice, 111 F.3d 1183, 1209 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 1084 (1998).   Thus, we remanded for consideration of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming this aspect\n\nof the undergraduate scholarship policies at the historically\n\nwhite universities and of implementing, if necessary, appropriate\n\n\n\npolicies at those colleges impact access to the state-university\nsystem. See Ayers, 879 F. Supp. at 1474-75. Specifically, the\ndistrict court observed that the community colleges are in a\nposition to take students——who, upon graduation from high school,\nare not capable of succeeding at a four-year university——and to\nprepare them to transfer to a university and, thereby, to obtain\na four-year degree. Id. Because these under-prepared students\nwere often African-American, the court suggested that the\ncommunity colleges were a valuable resource for integrating the\nfour-year universities and for serving as an alternative route to\na bachelors degree for black students. Id. Finding that the\ncommunity colleges were not performing this task “to any great\ndegree,” the court therefore ordered the Board to study whether\nthe universities and the community colleges should coordinate\ntheir admissions requirements and remedial programs. Id. at\n1475.\n\n                                 9\n\fremedial relief.     Id. at 1209, 1228.   In addition, we directed\n\nthe district court to investigate the status of the Board’s\n\nproposal to consolidate Mississippi Valley State and Delta State.\n\nId. at 1214, 1228.    If the district court determined that the\n\nBoard planned not to merge the two schools, we instructed the\n\ncourt to order the Board to study other methods of desegregating\n\nMississippi Valley State, including adding academic programs at\n\nthat school.   Id.    We also concluded that the Board should report\n\nto the monitoring committee on new academic and land-grant\n\nprograms that would have a reasonable chance of increasing the\n\nnumber of non-African-American students attending Alcorn State.\n\nId. at 1214, 1228.    Additionally, we remanded the issue of\n\nequipment funding, asking the district court to investigate the\n\ncause and segregative effect of disparities between the money\n\nreceived by the historically white universities and the\n\nhistorically black universities and, if necessary, to implement\n\nappropriate relief.     Id. at 1225, 1228.   Finally, we instructed\n\nthe district court to monitor closely the effectiveness of the\n\nsummer remedial program.     Id. at 1228-29.   We indicated that the\n\nprogram should be reformed as necessary to achieve the objective\n\nof identifying and admitting students who are capable——with\n\nreasonable remediation——of performing at the university level,\n\nbut who fail to qualify for regular admission.      Id.\n\n     5.   Proceedings on Remand From Our 1997 Decision\n\n\n                                  10\n\f     Below we briefly review the aspects of the proceedings\n\nconducted and the orders issued by the district court on remand\n\nfrom our 1997 decision in this case that are relevant to this\n\nappeal.\n\n     In June 1998, the district court ruled that it would no\n\nlonger consider the consolidation of Mississippi Valley State and\n\nDelta State, since the Board had concluded that the merger was\n\nnot practical.     Thus, as we instructed it to do in our 1997\n\nopinion, the court directed the Board to study programs that\n\ncould be implemented at Mississippi Valley State to attract non-\n\nAfrican-American students.     Next, the district court found that\n\nthe Board was in the process of implementing a Ph.D. program in\n\nsocial work at Jackson State.     After observing that, in response\n\nto our 1997 decision, the Board had ceased using ACT scores as\n\nthe sole criterion for awarding scholarships, the district court\n\ninstructed the Board to submit information to the court and to\n\nthe Plaintiffs regarding the educational soundness of using ACT\n\nscores as one aspect of the scholarship-award criteria.\n\n     In August 1998, the district court appointed a monitor to\n\naid the court and the parties in implementing the remedial\n\ndecree: Dr. Jerry Boone, a former state university administrator\n\nfrom Tennessee.6\n\n\n     6\n          The court amended its previous order that had provided\nfor a three-person monitoring committee. To the extent that\nAppellants now contend that either the district court’s selection\n\n                                  11\n\f     In October 1999, the district court ruled that the Board had\n\nfully complied with several of its obligations concerning Jackson\n\nState.   After considering the monitor’s status report, the court\n\nconcluded that the Board had implemented academic programs in\n\nallied health, social work (Ph.D.), urban planning (masters and\n\nPh.D.), and business (Ph.D.) at Jackson State.   The court also\n\nnoted that the Board had conducted an institutional study of\n\nJackson State and had prepared to establish an engineering school\n\nat the university.   Accordingly, the court stated that the Board\n\n\n\nof a sole monitor or the identity of the individual selected to\nserve as the monitor requires us to invalidate the parties’\nsettlement, we reject their contention. Approximately six months\nafter we handed down our 1997 decision in this case, the district\ncourt ordered each side to submit six names from which the court\nwould select the monitoring committee. In the opinion\naccompanying its order, the court noted that the parties’ failure\nto agree on the membership of the monitoring committee was\ndelaying the implementation of the remedial decree. At that\ntime, the Private Plaintiffs, who were represented by Alvin\nChambliss (attorney for Appellants here), were busy seeking\nSupreme Court review of our 1997 decision. Consequently, counsel\nfor the Private Plaintiffs chose not to address the issues then\npending in the trial court, such as the composition of the\nmonitoring committee. At the district court’s direction, the\nUnited States submitted names of candidates for the monitoring\ncommittee on behalf of both itself and the Private Plaintiffs.\nApproximately two-and-a-half months after the district court’s\ndeadline for the submission of candidates had passed, the Private\nPlaintiffs filed a motion requesting access to the list of\ncandidates submitted by the Defendants, but it does not appear\nthat the Private Plaintiffs ever sought to submit their own list\nof candidates. While the record does not reflect precisely why\nthe district court——faced with the parties’ inability to agree on\nthe committee’s composition——eventually decided to appoint only\none monitor, we cannot conclude that the court’s action requires\nus to invalidate the present settlement. Further, we reject\nAppellants’ unsupported attacks on Dr. Boone’s qualifications to\nserve as the court-appointed monitor.\n\n                                12\n\fhad complied with most of its duties regarding new academic\n\nprograms at Jackson State.\n\n     In July 1999, the district court ruled that the Board had\n\ncomplied with the paragraph of the remedial decree concerning\n\ncoordination of admissions standards and establishment of\n\narticulation agreements between the State’s community colleges\n\nand its universities.   The court found that Mississippi’s\n\ncommunity colleges had approved an open-admissions policy.\n\nFurther, the court observed that the Board had standardized “an\n\nalternative procedure for students to qualify for university\n\nadmission by completing specified requirements at a community\n\ncollege.”   The court also noted that, under the Board’s policy,\n\nstudents who unsuccessfully attempt the summer remedial program\n\nare counseled regarding community-college enrollment.\n\n     In July 2000, the district court approved the Mississippi\n\nLegislature’s appropriation of funds to construct a facility to\n\nhouse the court-ordered MBA program at Alcorn State’s Natchez\n\ncampus.   See Ayers v. Fordice, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, 2000 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 9877, at *9 (N.D. Miss. July 6, 2000).\n\n     In January 2001, the district court issued an order\n\nregarding legal and pharmacy education at Jackson State.     Finding\n\nno unmet demand for legal education in the Jackson area, the\n\ncourt concluded that the Board need not establish a law school at\n\nJackson State for the purpose of desegregating that institution.\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fThe district court also found that the existing pharmacy program\n\nat the University of Mississippi was meeting the State’s need for\n\npharmacy education.   It further ruled that the creation of either\n\na law school or a pharmacy school at Jackson State was neither\n\nfeasible nor educationally sound.7     The district court then\n\nannounced that “[w]ith these issues resolved, the court finds\n\nthat all elements of the Ayers Remedial Decree having to do with\n\nJackson State University and involving significant expenditures\n\nof funds have now been completed.”\n\n     In February 2001, the district court concluded that the\n\nBoard’s proposal regarding facilities-maintenance funds\n\nessentially satisfied this aspect of the remedial decree.\n\n     To summarize the status of this litigation when the district\n\ncourt was presented with the proposed settlement agreement, most\n\nof both the district court’s remedial decree and our instructions\n\non remand had been implemented.    Thus, only the following issues\n\nremained to some extent unresolved: (1) further review of the\n\nuniform admissions standards;8 (2) continued evaluation of the\n\n     7\n          But, while noting that such a program was not required\nby the court’s remedial decree, the district court approved the\nBoard’s proposal for an inter-institutional pharmacy program,\njointly controlled by Jackson State, the University of\nMississippi, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\n     8\n          In June 1998, the district court ordered the Board to\nmonitor freshman enrollment statewide to assess the impact of the\nuniform admissions standards. The district court had scheduled a\nhearing on the admissions standards, but it was postponed pending\nsettlement negotiations. In his analysis of enrollment data from\n1993-1998, the monitor reported “a substantial and fairly steady\n\n                                  14\n\fsummer remedial program;9 (3) investigation of potential new\n\nacademic programs that might help to desegregate Mississippi\n\nValley State and Alcorn State; (4) assessment of equipment\n\nfunding; and (5) consideration of the use of ACT scores as a\n\ncomponent of the criteria for awarding scholarships.\n\nB.   Proceedings Concerning the Settlement Agreement\n\n     1.   The Settlement Agreement\n\n     After lengthy negotiations, all of the Defendants, the\n\n\nincrease in total freshmen enrollments, universities and\ncommunity colleges combined, among resident black students.” But\nhe also noted that African-American freshmen were “drift[ing]\naway from the universities and toward the community colleges.”\nIn addition, the monitor cautioned against placing too much\nweight on the data, pointing out that his analysis dealt only\nwith numbers from three years before and three years after the\nuniform admissions standards were instituted.\n     9\n          The monitor also reported to the district court on the\neffectiveness of the summer remedial program. The monitor’s\nassessment of the program was quite positive; he concluded:\n“Overall, I believe the spring screening and summer remedial\nprogram should be regarded as a success for those who attend the\nsummer program. Most of the students who go through it complete\nit successfully and go on to attend one of the universities in\nthe fall.” Further, he noted that there had been “no reduction\nin black students attending college since the summer program was\ninitiated, although a larger proportion are choosing to attend a\ncommunity college,” a result which did not trouble the monitor\n“because transfer arrangements between the universities and the\ncommunity colleges make initial enrollment in a community college\na clear alternative for university-bound students who prefer not\nto go through the summer program.” Noting that many of the\nrejected applicants who did not participate in the spring\nscreening process and the summer remedial program were apparently\nunaware of the programs’ existence, the monitor recommended that\nthe Board should be required to ensure that students who do not\nqualify for regular admission are adequately informed about the\nspring screening process and the summer remedial program,\nincluding the availability of financial aid for participants.\n\n                               15\n\fUnited States, and the lead Private Plaintiff (Congressman Bennie\n\nThompson),10 on behalf of both himself and the Private-Plaintiff\n\nclass, reached a settlement agreement.   By its terms, “[j]udicial\n\napproval of [the] Agreement is to relieve the Board, and all\n\nother defendants, of any further obligations under the remedial\n\ndecree.”   Further, the “only obligations of the Board, and other\n\ndefendants, arising out of or related to the Ayers litigation\n\nwill be those specified in [the] Agreement.”    We describe below\n\nthe major obligations contained in the Agreement.\n\n           a.   Financial Assistance for the Summer Remedial\n                Program\n\n     Under the agreement, the State will provide special funding\n\nin the amount of $500,000 annually for five years (from 2002-\n\n2006) and $750,000 annually for five additional years (from 2007-\n\n2011) to supplement the need-based financial aid presently\n\navailable to summer program participants.11    Further, the\n\nagreement obligates the Board to “widely” publicize both the\n\nopportunity to enroll in the summer remedial program and the\n\n\n\n\n     10\n          Congressman Thompson is one of the twenty-one original\nnamed plaintiffs in this suit, and in March 2000, the district\ncourt designated——for “purposes of efficient communications and\norganization”——Congressman Thompson as the “lead plaintiff” in\nthis action.\n     11\n          The Board, however, “specifically reserves the right to\nno longer provide the summer program at certain Mississippi\nuniversities should future circumstances so warrant.”\n\n                                16\n\favailability of financial aid for program participants.12\n\n          b.   Academic Programs\n\n     The agreement provides for the establishment, continuation,\n\nor enhancement of a variety of academic programs at Alcorn State,\n\nJackson State, and Mississippi Valley State.13   Further,\n\n\n     12\n          This provision is directly responsive to the monitor’s\nrecommendation that the Board adequately inform students who are\ndenied regular admission about the summer program and the\nfinancial aid available to those who participate in it.\n     13\n          The specific programs or program areas named in the\nagreement are detailed below. When a particular program is being\nor will be provided at a branch campus, that information is\nindicated parenthetically.\n     Alcorn State: (1) business administration, masters (Natchez\ncampus); (2) accounting, masters (Natchez campus); (3) finance,\nbachelors (Lorman campus) and masters (Natchez campus);\n(4) physician assistants, masters (Natchez campus or Vicksburg\ncampus); (5) biotechnology, masters (Lorman campus); (6) computer\nnetworking, bachelors (Vicksburg campus); (7) environmental\nscience, bachelors (Lorman campus); (8) nursing; (9) teacher\neducation; (10) mathematics and sciences (biology, chemistry,\nphysics); and (11) computer science.\n     Jackson State: (1) business, Ph.D.; (2) urban planning,\nmasters and Ph.D.; (3) social work, Ph.D.; (4) civil engineering,\nbachelors; (5) computer engineering, bachelors;\n(6) telecommunications engineering, bachelors; (7) public health,\nmasters; (8) health care administration, bachelors;\n(9) communicative disorders, masters; (10) higher education,\nPh.D.; (11) public health, Ph.D.; (12) Mississippi\nInterinstitutional Pharmacy Initiative; (13) school of allied\nhealth; (14) school of public health; (15) school of engineering\n(graduate programs in civil, computer, and telecommunications\nengineering will be considered for implementation upon\naccreditation of the baccalaureate engineering programs);\n(16) business; and (17) education.\n     Mississippi Valley State: (1) history, bachelors;\n(2) special education, masters and bachelors; (3) computer\nscience, masters; (4) bioinformatics, masters; (5) leadership\nadministration, masters; (6) business administration, masters;\n(7) biology; (8) chemistry; (9) computer science;\n(10) mathematics; and (11) special education.\n\n                                17\n\fbeginning with fiscal year 2002, annual appropriations are to be\n\nprovided to the historically black universities for seventeen\n\nyears, in the total amount of $245,880,000, to fund the numerous\n\nacademic programs detailed in the agreement.14\n\n          c.   Endowments\n\n     The agreement establishes both a publicly funded and a\n\nprivately funded endowment for the benefit of Alcorn State,\n\nJackson State, and Mississippi Valley State.     Mississippi will\n\ncreate the public endowment, which will consist of $70 million,\n\nover the course of fourteen years.   Additionally, the agreement\n\nrequires the Board to use its best efforts over a seven-year\n\nperiod to raise $35 million for the privately funded endowment.\n\n     Initially, the endowments will be managed by a seven-person\n\ncommittee composed of the presidents of the historically black\n\nuniversities, the Commissioner of Higher Education, two members\n\nof the Board, and a member to be agreed on by the other members.\n\n\n\n     14\n          The agreement also states that,\n     The Board will maintain the right to evaluate program\n     implementation in light of program objectives including\n     reservation of the right to direct reallocation of\n     monies, in consultation with the presidents of the\n     historically black universities, to other academic\n     programs and other-race endeavors identified in this\n     Agreement. Given the considerable period of time covered\n     by this Agreement, the Board further reserves the right\n     to substitute academic programs, in consultation with the\n     presidents of the historically black universities, for\n     those presently identified should future circumstances so\n     warrant.\n\n\n                                18\n\fThe income from both endowments will be allocated 28.3% to Alcorn\n\nState, 43.4% to Jackson State, and 28.3% to Mississippi Valley\n\nState, with the schools being required to use the funds for\n\nother-race15 marketing and recruitment, including the employment\n\nof other-race recruiting personnel and the award of other-race\n\nstudent scholarships.      The schools may also expend the endowment\n\nincome on the academic programs provided for in the agreement.\n\n     Alcorn State, Jackson State, and Mississippi Valley State\n\nwill each receive its pro rata share of the endowments when the\n\ninstitution attains a total other-race enrollment of ten percent\n\nand sustains that enrollment for three consecutive years.      After\n\nobtaining full control over the endowment funds, the historically\n\nblack universities may use the income for “sound academic\n\npurposes such as faculty compensation, academic program\n\nenhancements and student scholarships.”\n\n            d.   Capital Improvements\n\n     The agreement authorizes various capital improvements, at a\n\ntotal cost of up to $75 million, at Alcorn State, Jackson State,\n\nand Mississippi Valley State.\n\n            e.   Funding\n\n     According to the agreement, the funding necessary to\n\nimplement the agreement’s provisions supplements the usual\n\n\n\n     15\n            The agreement defines “other-race” as non-African-\nAmerican.\n\n                                   19\n\fappropriations made to the state-university system and does not\n\nsupplant normal funding for Alcorn State, Jackson State, and\n\nMississippi Valley State.\n\n          f.    Recognition of Jackson State as a Comprehensive\n                University\n\n     Acknowledging that Jackson State presently offers a broad\n\narray of academic programs and that its service area extends\n\nbeyond the Jackson, Mississippi, metropolitan area, the Board\n\nagrees that Jackson State should be “recognized as a\n\ncomprehensive university.”   The additional programs, facilities,\n\nand other resources to which comprehensive recognition entitles\n\nJackson State are those provided for in the agreement.\n\n          g.    Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Under the agreement, the attorneys for the Private\n\nPlaintiffs will receive a total of $2.5 million for fees, costs,\n\nand expenses.   Additionally, the agreement states that\n\n     The class representative (Congressman Thompson) and Class\n     counsel Byrd, Derfner and Pressman specifically represent\n     that North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, The Center\n     for Law and Education, and Alvin O. Chambliss, Jr. have\n     knowledge of these provisions (i) that the Ayers\n     defendants’ obligations for attorneys’ fees, costs and\n     expenses will be fully satisfied on payment of $2,500,000\n     . . . and (ii) that no present or former counsel for the\n     Class, or member of the Class, may seek attorneys’ fees,\n     costs and expenses other than as set forth in this\n     Agreement.\n\n          h.    Settlement Implementation\n\n     The agreement obligates the Board to report annually to lead\n\ncounsel for the Private Plaintiffs and counsel for the United\n\n                                  20\n\fStates on the agreement’s implementation.     In addition, it\n\nexpresses the parties’ decision to submit to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the district court any dispute relating to the\n\nagreement.    Also, the agreement will not become final until its\n\napproval is no longer subject to further appeal or judicial\n\nreview.\n\n     2.    Appellants’ Motion to Opt Out\n\n     Unhappy with the relief provided for in the agreement,\n\nAppellants filed a motion to opt out of the Private-Plaintiff\n\nclass.    After holding a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district\n\ncourt denied their motion.     See Ayers v. Musgrove, No. 4:75CV009-\n\nB-D, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, at *1, *18 (N.D. Miss. Nov. 26,\n\n2001).\n\n     3.    The District Court’s Approval of the Settlement\n           Agreement\n\n     Several months after it ordered that notice of the proposed\n\nsettlement be published in newspapers throughout Mississippi, the\n\ndistrict court conducted a fairness hearing, receiving testimony\n\nfrom proponents of and objectors to the settlement.     See Ayers v.\n\nMusgrove, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, 2002 WL 91895 (N.D. Miss. Jan. 2,\n\n2002).    The district court acknowledged that it had heard\n\npersuasive arguments both for and against approving the\n\nsettlement.    Id. at *3.16   Despite having concerns about the\n\n\n     16\n          In its opinion, the court summarized the most weighty\ncontentions on each side. See Ayers, 2002 WL 91895, at *3-4.\n\n                                   21\n\fproposed settlement, including its high cost and long duration,\n\nthe district court expressed a preference for ending this case\n\nthrough agreement of the parties.     Id. at *4.   But it worried\n\nthat none of the parties involved had the authority to\n\nappropriate the substantial sum necessary to fund the proposal.\n\nId. at *4.    Accordingly, the district court stated that——if the\n\nMississippi Legislature would endorse the agreement and agree to\n\nfund it——the court would approve the settlement.      Id. at *5.\n\n     After the district court received a concurrent resolution\n\nevidencing the Legislature’s support for and agreement to fund\n\nthe settlement, the court issued a final judgment approving the\n\nsettlement.    According to the district court,\n\n     [I]f the State of Mississippi through its elected\n     representatives, the policymakers of the State, wants to\n     go further in the enhancements to the historically black\n     institutions than called for by the court——and they have\n     advised the court they do——then their actions will be\n     given precedence. It is not illegal to do more than that\n     required by the Constitution.\n\nAyers v. Musgrove, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, slip op. at 2 (N.D. Miss.\n\nFeb. 15, 2002).    The court’s decision, inter alia, specified that\n\n(1) this suit is a class action certified under Rule 23(b)(2);\n\n(2) the settlement agreement is incorporated by reference into\n\nthe final judgment; (3) the agreement “affords the Class Members\n\nconsiderable relief in light of the established law of this case,\n\nthe present stage of these proceedings and the range of possible\n\nrecovery through further litigation, and is, in all respects,\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\ffair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interest of the\n\nClass”; and (4) all claims relating to this controversy are\n\ndismissed with prejudice.17   Id. at 2-4.   In addition to\n\nappealing the district court’s final judgment approving the\n\nsettlement, Appellants challenge the district court’s denial of\n\ntheir motion to opt out of the Private-Plaintiff class.18\n\n                      II. Standard of Review\n\n     A district court’s findings of fact must be accepted unless\n\nthose findings are clearly erroneous, but we review de novo a\n\ndistrict court’s conclusions of law.    See Prudhomme v. Tenneco\n\nOil Co., 955 F.2d 390, 392 (5th Cir. 1992).    In addition, “[o]ur\n\nappellate review of the district court’s approval of a settlement\n\nis limited; an approved settlement will not be upset unless the\n\ncourt clearly abused its discretion.”    Parker v. Anderson, 667\n\nF.2d 1204, 1209 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982) (citing Young v. Katz, 447\n\n\n\n     17\n          Before turning to the merits of Appellants’\ncontentions, we briefly observe that the funding provided for in\nthe settlement agreement is apparently being withheld, pending\nfinal judicial approval of the parties’ settlement. At oral\nargument, counsel for the State explained that, while the Board\ncontinues to fulfill its obligations under the district court’s\nremedial decree, implementation of the additional commitments\ncontained in the agreement awaits final court approval of the\nsettlement.\n     18\n          Below we address those of Appellants’ contentions that\nwe can adequately discern from the briefing. Several of\nAppellants’ arguments are insufficiently developed and are,\ntherefore, waived. See FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(9)(A); L & A\nContracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 106, 113\n(5th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                 23\n\fF.2d 431, 432 (5th Cir. 1971)); accord Reed v. Gen. Motors Corp.,\n\n703 F.2d 170, 172 (5th Cir. 1983).    Finally, a district court’s\n\ndenial of a motion to opt out of a class certified under Rule\n\n23(b)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion.    See Penson v.\n\nTerminal Transp. Co., 634 F.2d 989, 994 (5th Cir. Unit B Jan.\n\n1981).\n\n                          III. Discussion\n\nA.   The District Court’s Approval of the Settlement Agreement\n\n     A district court has discretion to approve a class-action\n\nsettlement under Rule 23(e) if the settlement is fair, adequate,\n\nand reasonable.   Parker, 667 F.2d at 1208-09.   Our cases instruct\n\nthat the district court’s “exercise of discretion is to be tested\n\nby inquiries that ‘ensure that the settlement is in the interest\n\nof the class, does not unfairly impinge on the rights and\n\ninterests of dissenters, and does not merely mantle oppression.’”\n\nReed, 703 F.2d at 172 (quoting Pettway v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co.,\n\n576 F.2d 1157, 1214 (5th Cir. 1978)).    Further, six factors guide\n\nour review of a decision to approve a settlement agreement\n\nresolving a class-action suit:\n\n     (1) the existence of fraud or collusion behind the\n     settlement; (2) the complexity, expense and likely\n     duration of the litigation; (3) the stage of the\n     proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;\n     (4) the probability of plaintiffs’ success on the merits;\n     (5) the range of possible recovery; and (6) the opinions\n     of the class counsel, class representatives, and absent\n     class members.\n\nId. (citing Parker, 667 F.2d at 1209).    Accordingly, we focus\n\n                                 24\n\fbelow on the Parker factors, and we also address both Appellants’\n\ninadequate-representation contention and their challenge to the\n\nagreement’s provision regarding attorneys’ fees.\n\n     1.   Fraud or Collusion\n\n     Appellants’ brief contains several vague assertions of\n\ncollusion.   Primarily, Appellants claim that they had\n\ninsufficient access to and participation in the settlement\n\nnegotiations.   Further, they suggest that collusion occurred in\n\nthe negotiation of attorneys’ fees.\n\n     It is unclear why Appellants’ attorney, Alvin Chambliss (who\n\nrepresented the Private-Plaintiff class for many years), did not\n\nparticipate in the settlement negotiations.    The lead Private\n\nPlaintiff, Congressman Thompson, testified at the fairness\n\nhearing that every effort was made to keep Mr. Chambliss informed\n\nregarding the negotiations.    Further, letters and\n\nfacsimiles——indicating correspondence between lead counsel for\n\nthe class and Mr. Chambliss concerning the settlement talks——were\n\npresented as exhibits at the fairness hearing.    Regardless, the\n\ndistrict court found Appellants’ allegations of collusion to be\n\nunsupported.    Ayers, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, at *16.\n\nBecause Appellants have pointed to no record evidence that\n\ncontradicts this finding——let alone evidence showing it to be\n\nclearly erroneous——we reject their contention that collusion was\n\npresent in the settlement negotiations.\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\f     2.    The Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the\n           Suit and the Stage of the Proceedings\n\n     The second and third Parker factors——the complexity,\n\nexpense, and likely duration of the litigation and the stage of\n\nthe proceedings and the amount of discovery completed——weigh in\n\nfavor of affirming the district court’s decision.      First,\n\nregarding the second factor, settling now avoids the risks and\n\nburdens of potentially protracted litigation concerning several\n\naspects of our remand instructions and the district court’s\n\nremedial decree.     See supra notes 8-9 and accompanying text\n\n(describing five issues that were not fully resolved when the\n\nparties reached their agreement).      Specifically, settlement\n\neliminates the transaction costs that further proceedings would\n\nimpose on the process of desegregating Mississippi’s state-\n\nuniversity system.    The agreement also provides relief for the\n\nclass sooner than continued litigation would.\n\n     Second, examination of the stage of the proceedings and the\n\namount of discovery completed weighs in favor of upholding the\n\nsettlement.   The several trials and appeals that have already\n\noccurred in this case have largely resolved the controlling legal\n\nissues.   Thus, the parties and the district court possess ample\n\ninformation with which to evaluate the merits of the competing\n\npositions.\n\n     3.    Likelihood of Success on the Merits and Range of\n           Possible Recovery\n\n\n                                  26\n\f     Because two trials and several appeals have already occurred\n\nin this case, the probability of the Plaintiffs’ success on the\n\nmerits and the range of possible recovery have largely been\n\nresolved.    Our 1997 opinion conclusively determined nearly all of\n\nthe State’s obligations.19    Most of our instructions to the\n\ndistrict court in that opinion concerned the remedial decree, see\n\nAyers, 111 F.3d at 1228-29, and as discussed above, the district\n\ncourt concluded——before the parties reached their\n\nsettlement——that much of the remedial decree had been\n\nsatisfied.20\n\n     Nevertheless, aside from their allegations of collusion,\n\nAppellants’ main objections to the settlement agreement center on\n\ntheir view that the relief it provides is inadequate.     Appellants\n\nprimarily seek more money for academic programs and facilities at\n\nthe historically black universities and lower admissions\n\nstandards.     But they also object to the requirement that the\n\n\n     19\n          Appellants claim that Mississippi, in dismantling its\nformer system of de jure segregation, has not complied with Title\nVI and several regulations and policies promulgated in accordance\nwith that statute. But their reliance on Title VI and its\nimplementing regulations is unavailing because Mississippi’s\nobligations have been determined under the Fourteenth Amendment;\nboth the Supreme Court and this court have stated that the\nrequirements of Title VI extend no further than those of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Fordice, 505 U.S. at 732 n.7; Ayers, 111\nF.3d at 1191 n.5.\n     20\n          To the extent that Appellants allege that the district\ncourt disregarded our 1997 remand instructions, we reject their\ncontention. Appellants do not direct us to anything in the\nrecord that would support such an assertion.\n\n                                  27\n\fhistorically black universities reach and sustain an other-race\n\nenrollment of ten percent before gaining full control over the\n\nendowments created by the settlement agreement.   Additionally,\n\nAppellants assert that the agreement does not adequately address\n\ninstitutional mission designations,21 faculty\n\nsalaries, governance, accreditation, and the allocation of land-\n\ngrant functions between Alcorn State and Mississippi State\n\nUniversity.   We address each of Appellants’ specific contentions\n\nin turn below and explain why Appellants are unlikely to achieve\n\ngreater relief through further litigation.\n\n     Concerning Appellants’ desire for more funding for and\n\n\n\n     21\n          In 1981, the Board assigned missions to the state\nuniversities in Mississippi. Ayers, 674 F. Supp. at 1539. A\nuniversity’s “mission” defines the institution’s “role and scope”\nrelative to the other institutions within the system. Id. The\nBoard designated the University of Mississippi, Mississippi\nState, and the University of Southern Mississippi as\n“comprehensive” universities. Id. This designation indicates\nthat these institutions offered a greater number and higher level\nof degree programs than did the remaining universities and that\nthese schools were expected to offer a number of doctoral\nprograms, but not in the same disciplines. Id. Jackson State\nwas classified as an “urban” university, indicating that its role\nwas to serve the urban community of Jackson, Mississippi. Id. at\n1539-40. Mississippi Valley State, Alcorn State, Mississippi\nUniversity for Women, and Delta State received the designation of\n“regional” university. Id. at 1540. The regional designation\nsignifies that these institutions were expected to focus on the\nprovision of undergraduate education. Id.\n     While the agreement provides for the recognition of Jackson\nState as a comprehensive university, it also states that Jackson\nState’s “use of the comprehensive description does not imply any\nchange in [its] institutional mission classification.\nInstitutional mission designations are not being addressed by\nthis Agreement.”\n\n                                28\n\fprograms at the historically black universities, our 1997\n\ndecision affirmed the district court’s finding that “merely\n\nadding programs and increasing budgets is not likely to\n\ndesegregate” a historically black university.      Ayers, 111 F.3d at\n\n1213 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAdditionally, we upheld the district court’s determination that\n\nthe State’s funding formula is not traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.     Id. at 1224-25.   While we did instruct the district\n\ncourt to investigate potential programmatic enhancements at\n\nAlcorn State and Mississippi Valley State for the purpose of\n\ndesegregating those schools, id. at 1228, the settlement\n\nagreement makes ample provision for academic offerings at both\n\nuniversities.    Further, testimony of the Board’s witnesses at the\n\nfairness hearing indicates that many of these programs were\n\nselected in accordance with our guidance that “well-planned\n\nprograms that respond to the particular needs and interests of\n\nlocal populations can help to desegregate historically black\n\ninstitutions.”    Id. at 1213-14.\n\n     As discussed above, several new academic programs have also\n\nbeen added at Jackson State, and the settlement agreement\n\nprovides for the continuation of these programs in addition to\n\nthe implementation of several new programs.     Appellants\n\nnonetheless assert that the settlement should be invalidated\n\nbecause programs in law, pharmacy, engineering, and public health\n\n\n\n                                    29\n\fhave not been established at Jackson State.     Further, they\n\ncontend that Jackson State should have partial control over the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center, located in Jackson,\n\nMississippi.\n\n     Each of Appellants’ contentions has been addressed by prior\n\ncourt rulings.    First, the district court found, in its January\n\n2001 order discussed above, that placing either a law school or a\n\npharmacy school at Jackson State was neither feasible nor\n\neducationally sound; moreover, no party even sought such steps at\n\nthe time of the district court’s ruling.22     Second, in the same\n\norder, the district court noted that an engineering school and a\n\nmasters in public health program have already been implemented at\n\nJackson State, and the settlement agreement provides continued\n\nfunding for these offerings as well as funding for a school of\n\npublic health at Jackson State.      Third, regarding the University\n\nof Mississippi Medical Center, our 1997 decision affirmed the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that institutional affiliation between\n\nJackson State and the Medical Center had no desegregative\n\npotential.     Id. at 1211, 1215.\n\n     Regarding facilities at the historically black universities,\n\nour 1997 opinion also rejected “Plaintiffs’ argument for general\n\n\n\n     22\n          An inter-institutional pharmacy program, over which\nJackson State has partial control, was developed, however, and\nthe settlement agreement provides for the continuation of that\nprogram.\n\n                                    30\n\ffunds to enhance facilities” at these schools.    Id. at 1224.\n\nStill, the settlement agreement provides up to $75 million for\n\ncapital improvements at the historically black universities,\n\nincluding acquisition of property, construction of new buildings\n\nand repairs and renovation of existing ones, purchase of\n\nadditional equipment, and landscaping and drainage installation.\n\nIn addition, in its February 2001 order discussed above, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the Board had essentially satisfied\n\nits obligation under the remedial decree to assume greater\n\ncontrol over funds for facilities maintenance.\n\n     Turning to Appellants’ contentions respecting the current\n\nadmissions policy, their hope for lower admissions standards also\n\ncannot be reconciled with our 1997 opinion, which specifically\n\napproved the district court’s adoption of uniform admissions\n\nstandards that are rigorous enough to exclude students incapable\n\nof succeeding at the university level.    See id. at 1198-1200.   In\n\nparticular, we affirmed the district court’s finding that the\n\nopen admissions component of the standards then (and, apparently,\n\nagain now) sought by the Private Plaintiffs was educationally\n\nunsound.23   Id. at 1199.   We did, however, instruct the district\n\n\n     23\n          At oral argument, Appellants advocated a return to\ntiered admissions standards, with the historically white\nuniversities employing stricter admissions criteria than the\nhistorically black universities. Appellants fail to recognize,\nhowever, that the Supreme Court condemned that prior policy as a\nvestige of de jure segregation with continued discriminatory\neffects. See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734-35.\n\n                                  31\n\fcourt to review the efficacy of the spring screening process and\n\nthe summer remedial program.    See id. at 1201, 1228-29.      As\n\ndiscussed above, the court-appointed monitor’s reports indicate\n\nthat the summer program has been a success.     Further, the\n\nsettlement agreement responds to the monitor’s primary\n\nrecommendation regarding the summer program——i.e., that the\n\nprogram, and the availability of financial aid for participants,\n\nshould be adequately publicized by the Board.\n\n     We also reject Appellants’ objection to the requirement that\n\neach of the historically black universities achieve and maintain\n\nten-percent other-race enrollment before receiving its share of\n\nthe endowments.    As the United States explains in its brief, the\n\nten-percent threshold seeks to ensure that the historically black\n\nuniversities devote the endowment funds to promoting the\n\ndesegregation of their schools, not to upgrading them “so that\n\nthey may be publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by\n\nprivate choice.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.   This provision will\n\nnot encourage the historically black universities to discriminate\n\nin admitting students because the current admissions standards\n\nare uniform across the state-university system; the schools lack\n\ndiscretion to deny entry to those applicants who meet the uniform\n\ncriteria.   Instead, the ten-percent threshold will provide the\n\nhistorically black universities with a legitimate incentive to\n\n\n\n\n                                 32\n\frecruit and to attract other-race students.24\n\n     In addition, Appellants’ complaint that institutional\n\nmission designations should have been addressed in the agreement\n\nis not well taken.   In our 1997 opinion we observed that the\n\ndistrict court’s remedial decree “does not order any alteration\n\nof the mission designations,” and we further noted that “[n]o\n\nparty appeals retention of the mission designations per se.”\n\nAyers, 111 F.3d at 1211.   But, even if we were to reconsider this\n\nissue now, the extensive programmatic enhancements at the\n\nhistorically black universities that have been implemented thus\n\nfar and will be established as a result of the agreement are\n\nintended to remedy the present segregative effects of this\n\nparticular vestige of de jure segregation.   Cf. id. at 1213 (“The\n\nissue of programmatic enhancement directly implicates policies\n\ngoverning institutional missions, which the district court found\n\nto be traceable to the de jure system and to have current\n\nsegregative effects.”).\n\n     Finally, turning to Appellants’ last four areas of concern,\n\nour 1997 decision affirmed the district court’s 1995 rulings that\n\nno relief was warranted to remedy disparities in the salaries,\n\nthe hiring, or the promotion of African-American faculty, id. at\n\n\n\n     24\n          Moreover, we note that the ten-percent threshold\nresponds to the monitor’s observation that the historically white\nuniversities have been desegregating faster than the historically\nblack universities.\n\n                                33\n\f1226-27; to modify the composition of the Board or its staff, id.\n\nat 1227-28; to address the Board’s efforts regarding the\n\naccreditation of academic programs at the historically black\n\nuniversities,25 id. at 1214-15; or to re-allocate land-grant\n\nresponsibilities between Alcorn State and Mississippi State\n\nUniversity, id. at 1217.\n\n     Accordingly, both the probability of the Plaintiffs’ success\n\non the merits and the range of possible recovery point strongly\n\nin favor of affirming.   Rejection of the settlement and further\n\nlitigation is unlikely to lead to greater relief for the Private-\n\nPlaintiff class, particularly since most of the relief sought by\n\nAppellants has been foreclosed by our 1997 decision in this case.\n\nThe settlement agreement provides meaningful relief; in\n\nparticular, it contains generous funding for (1) a variety of new\n\nand enhanced academic programs at the historically black\n\nuniversities and (2) financial aid for participants in the summer\n\nremedial program——a program lauded by the court-appointed\n\nmonitor——to assist those denied admission under the current\n\nuniform standards.   Further, we reiterate that the targeted\n\nprogrammatic enhancements provided for in the agreement are\n\nintended to promote desegregation at the historically black\n\n\n\n     25\n          We did, however, instruct the district court to ensure\nthat the then-existing business programs at Jackson State\nreceived accreditation. In June 1998, the district court\ndetermined that this step had been achieved.\n\n                                34\n\funiversities.    To the extent that Appellants “press us to order\n\nthe upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Mississippi\n\nValley State solely so that they may be publicly financed,\n\nexclusively black enclaves by private choice,” the Supreme Court\n\nhas rejected their contention.     Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.\n\n     4.   The Opinions of the Class Counsel, Class\n          Representatives, and Absent Class Members\n\n     Appellants also assert that reversal is required because\n\nmany class members oppose the settlement agreement.26    Our\n\njurisprudence, however, makes clear that a settlement can be\n\napproved despite opposition from class members, including named\n\nplaintiffs.     See Reed, 703 F.2d at 174-75 (affirming the district\n\ncourt’s approval of a settlement despite “the objections of\n\ntwenty-three of twenty-seven named plaintiffs and nearly forty\n\npercent of the 1,517 member class”); Parker, 667 F.2d at 1207-08,\n\n1214 (affirming a district court’s approval of a settlement of a\n\nclass-action suit even though nine of the eleven named plaintiffs\n\nopposed the settlement); Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331\n\n(5th Cir. 1977) (“A settlement can be fair notwithstanding a\n\nlarge number of class members who oppose it.”).     That several\n\n\n     26\n          Appellants claim that approximately 4,000 class\nmembers, including more than half of the original named\nplaintiffs, do not support the settlement agreement. But, while\nthe record indicates that several class members oppose the\nsettlement, the number does not appear to be anywhere near 4,000.\nAccording to the district court’s opinion regarding Appellants’\nmotion to opt out of the class, ninety-nine Private Plaintiffs\nsought to opt out. Ayers, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, at *1.\n\n                                  35\n\fclass members desire broader relief, which has been foreclosed by\n\nprior court rulings, does not prevent judicial approval of this\n\nsettlement agreement, which promises substantial relief to the\n\nclass.\n\n     5.   Inadequate Representation\n\n     Appellants also argue that the district court erred in\n\napproving the settlement because the class was not adequately\n\nrepresented during the settlement negotiations.   Mr. Chambliss,\n\nRobert Pressman, and Armand Derfner have represented the Private\n\nPlaintiffs for many years.   In March 2000, attorneys from the law\n\nfirm of Byrd and Associates entered an appearance on behalf of\n\nthe Private Plaintiffs, which was “acknowledged and agreed to” by\n\nMr. Chambliss.   Later that month, the district court designated\n\nCongressman Thompson as the lead plaintiff.   In May 2000, in\n\nresponse to an order from the district court, Congressman\n\nThompson named Isaac Byrd and Byrd’s law firm as lead counsel for\n\nthe Private Plaintiffs.   Still, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Pressman, and\n\nMr. Derfner continued to represent the Private-Plaintiff class.27\n\n     It appears that Mr. Byrd and his firm took the lead in\n\nnegotiating the settlement agreement on behalf of the Private\n\nPlaintiffs.   In their brief, Appellants criticize Congressman\n\nThompson’s and Mr. Byrd’s representation of the class during the\n\n\n     27\n          Mr. Pressman and Mr. Derfner, in addition to Mr. Byrd,\ncurrently represent the Private-Plaintiff Appellees in this\nappeal.\n\n                                36\n\fsettlement negotiations.    In particular, Appellants note that Mr.\n\nByrd is primarily a plaintiffs’ personal-injury lawyer and is\n\ninexperienced in civil-rights litigation.\n\n     In Reed, this court noted that “adequacy of representation\n\nand adequacy of settlement are different sides of the same\n\nquestion.”28    703 F.2d at 175.   Further, we stated that “the\n\nsettlement itself provides insight into adequacy of\n\nrepresentation.”    Id.; accord Parker, 667 F.2d at 1211 (stating\n\nthat “generally an attorney who secures and submits a fair and\n\nadequate settlement has represented the client class fairly and\n\nadequately”).    Here, the district court concluded that the\n\nsettlement agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and our\n\nanalysis of the agreement in the context of the Parker factors\n\nreveals no abuse of discretion by the district judge.       We also\n\nobserved in Reed that “it is the trial judge who can best know\n\nhow well the class was represented.”     703 F.2d at 175.    Here, the\n\ndistrict court found “the allegations of inadequate\n\nrepresentation of class members wholly unsubstantiated.”29\n\n     28\n          Indeed, Appellants’ complaints about the representation\nprovided by Congressman Thompson center on their disagreement\nwith his view that the settlement agreement is satisfactory.\n     29\n          In its order naming Thompson lead plaintiff, the\ndistrict court remarked that he “is one of the original named\nplaintiffs who brought this suit against the defendants herein\nand has been more active than any other plaintiff in pursuing\nthis case, having appeared before the court on several occasions\nas a witness and representative of the plaintiff class and also\nat conferences.”\n     Regarding the attorneys who negotiated the settlement\n\n                                   37\n\fAyers, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, at *16.     Accordingly, because\n\nthe agreement provides ample relief to the class and Appellants\n\nhave not shown that any record evidence supports their\n\ninadequate-representation allegation, we refuse to invalidate the\n\nsettlement on this ground.\n\n     6.   Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Appellants also contend that the settlement should be\n\nrejected because the amount of attorneys’ fees was negotiated\n\nalong with the rest of the agreement.     But they fail to cite any\n\nauthority for the proposition that a district court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it approves a settlement agreement that contains\n\na provision for attorneys’ fees.     On the contrary, the Supreme\n\nCourt has stated that, “[i]deally, of course, litigants will\n\nsettle the amount of a fee.”   Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n\n\n\nagreement, the district court stated,\n     Mr. Byrd, retained and named by Mr. Thompson, the lead\n     private plaintiff, as lead counsel for the class, is a\n     competent attorney whose co-counsel, Mr. Pressman and Mr.\n     Derfner, undisputedly competent and long-time attorneys\n     for the class, actively participated in the settlement\n     negotiation   process,   along   with   the  independent\n     participation of the United States Department of Justice\n     attorneys, whose competent representation of the United\n     States for more than twenty-five years is undisputed.\nAyers, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, at *16. That counsel for the\nUnited States was personally involved in the settlement\nnegotiations gives us an additional reason to conclude that the\nclass was adequately represented. Cf. United States v. City of\nMiami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1332 (5th Cir. 1980) (stating that, when\napproving a consent decree in a case in which the United States\nwas the plaintiff, a court “can safely assume that the interests\nof all affected have been considered”).\n\n                                38\n\f437 (1983).   True, the Court has suggested that, in cases where\n\nthe plaintiffs request damages and the defendant offers to settle\n\nfor a lump sum covering both damages and attorneys’ fees,\n\nnegotiating the allocation may present a conflict of interest for\n\nthe plaintiffs’ attorney.    But even in such cases, the Court has\n\ndeclined to prohibit simultaneous negotiation of liability and\n\nfees, stating that “a defendant may have good reason to demand to\n\nknow his total liability.”    White v. N.H. Dep’t of Employment\n\nSec., 455 U.S. 445, 454 n.15 (1982).   Indeed, in the context of\n\ncivil-rights litigation seeking injunctive relief, the Court has\n\nopined that prohibiting agreement between the parties on\n\nattorneys’ fees “might well preclude the settlement of a\n\nsubstantial number of cases.”    Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717,\n\n733 (1986); cf. Armstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 616 F.2d 305,\n\n312, 326-27 (7th Cir. 1980) (affirming the district court’s\n\napproval of a settlement agreement that resolved a public-school-\n\ndesegregation class action and that provided for the attorneys’\n\nfees of both counsel for the named plaintiffs and counsel for the\n\nabsent class members).   The provision for attorneys’ fees\n\ntherefore does not cause us to conclude that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in approving the settlement agreement.\n\n     7.   Conclusion\n\n     We have analyzed the agreement in the context of the Parker\n\nfactors, and we hold that the district court did not abuse its\n\n\n\n                                 39\n\fdiscretion in approving the settlement agreement.    Further, we\n\nagree with the district court that Appellants’ inadequate-\n\nrepresentation argument fails, and we reject Appellants’\n\nassertion that the agreement’s clause regarding attorneys’ fees\n\nrenders the settlement invalid.\n\nB.    The District Court’s Denial of Appellants’ Motion to Opt Out\n      of the Class\n\n      Appellants assert that they should have been permitted to\n\nopt out of the class because it does not satisfy the requirements\n\nof Rule 23(a).   Alternatively, they claim that Rule 23 cannot be\n\napplied to deny them the opportunity to litigate their claims in\n\na separate proceeding.   Appellants raise two arguments in support\n\nof this alterative contention.    First, they maintain that\n\nMississippi state law affords them the right to proceed with a\n\nseparate action30 and that Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304\n\nU.S. 64 (1938), requires us to apply state law rather than Rule\n\n23.   Second, Appellants suggest that refusing to permit them to\n\nopt out impinges on their First Amendment rights.\n\n      We have held that “a member of a class certified under Rule\n\n23(b)(2) has no absolute right to opt out of the class.”      Penson,\n\n634 F.2d at 994.   Rather, a “district court . . . acting under\n\nits Rule 23(d)(2) discretionary power, may require that an opt-\n\nout right and notice thereof be given should it believe that such\n\n\n\n      30\n           See MISS. CONST. art. 3, § 24.\n\n                                  40\n\fa right is desirable to protect the interests of the absent class\n\nmembers.”   Id.   Typically, such cases involve “hybrid” Rule\n\n23(b)(2) class actions, in which individual monetary relief for\n\ncertain class members is sought in addition to class-wide\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief.     Id.   “Such a class action, at\n\nleast in the relief stage, begins to resemble a 23(b)(3) action,\n\nand there has been more concern with protecting the due process\n\nrights of the individual class members to ensure they are aware\n\nof the opportunity to receive the monetary relief to which they\n\nare entitled.”    Id.\n\n     Here, the class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because\n\nMississippi, in maintaining vestiges of its prior de jure system\n\nof higher education, had “acted [and] refused to act on grounds\n\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\n\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with\n\nrespect to the class as a whole.”     FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2).   This\n\ncase is not a hybrid class action; the Private Plaintiffs have\n\nsought solely injunctive and declaratory relief throughout the\n\nlitigation.   Even in their briefs to this court,\n\nAppellants——while expressing their dissatisfaction with the\n\nextent of the relief provided for in the settlement agreement——do\n\nnot request any individual relief, whether monetary or otherwise.\n\nAppellants’ interests do not diverge from those of the Private\n\nPlaintiffs who support the settlement, except to the extent that\n\n\n\n                                 41\n\fAppellants believe that they are entitled to greater class-wide\n\ninjunctive relief.   Accordingly, since Appellants have failed to\n\nshow the existence of individual claims that are separate and\n\ndistinct from the claims for class-wide relief, the district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that no basis existed for it to\n\nexercise its discretion to allow Appellants to opt out.\n\n     Additionally, we reject Appellants’ assertion that the\n\nrequisites of Rule 23(a) have not been met here.   As discussed\n\nabove, the district court confirmed class certification in its\n\nfinal judgment.   Aside from their allegation of inadequate\n\nrepresentation, Appellants do not specify why——after nearly\n\nthirty years of litigation——they now feel that class\n\ncertification was improper in this case.   Further, Appellants’\n\ninadequate-representation argument fails in this context for the\n\nsame reason that this contention did not cause us to reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s approval of the settlement: Appellants provide\n\nnothing to contradict the district court’s finding that class\n\ncounsel and Congressman Thompson adequately represented the\n\nPrivate-Plaintiff class.\n\n     Finally, Appellants’ contentions based on Erie and the First\n\nAmendment lack merit.   First, this is not a diversity case; thus,\n\nErie is inapplicable.   Erie, 304 U.S. at 78 (“Except in matters\n\ngoverned by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the\n\nlaw to be applied in any case is the law of the State.” (emphasis\n\n\n\n                                42\n\fadded)).    Moreover, Erie does not affect the application of a\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure, such as Rule 23, in federal\n\ncourt.    See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 470 (1965) (“The Erie\n\nrule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule.”).    Second,\n\nAppellants provide no authority for the proposition that denying\n\nthem the right to opt out of a Rule 23(b)(2) class violates the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n     Appellants fail to articulate a viable ground for opting out\n\nof the class.   Consequently, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion.\n\nC.   Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Finally, Mr. Chambliss asserts that he is not bound by the\n\nprovision for attorneys’ fees in the settlement agreement.     He\n\ninsists that he is entitled to have his fee determined by the\n\ndistrict court.    Further, he claims that he should be compensated\n\nat the same level as the lawyers who represented Mississippi in\n\nits tobacco litigation.\n\n     Mr. Chambliss’s contention lacks merit.   First, to the\n\nextent that Mr. Chambliss challenges the distribution of the sum\n\nprovided in the settlement agreement for attorneys’ fees, there\n\nis no order for us to review because the district court has yet\n\nto rule on the allocation of the attorneys’-fees money.31\n\n\n     31\n          The district court directed the Private Plaintiffs’\nattorneys to agree on the allocation of the funds provided in the\nagreement for attorneys’ fees, or the court stated that it would\n\n                                 43\n\fSecond, if one reads Appellants’ brief as arguing that the\n\nsettlement agreement should not have been approved because the\n\nprovision for attorneys’ fees was improper, that contention is\n\nunavailing, as explained above.    Third, Mr. Chambliss provides no\n\nauthority for the proposition that he should be allowed to file a\n\nsubsequent claim for attorneys’ fees when the district court has\n\napproved a settlement that contains an agreement as to fees.    The\n\npreferred view seems to be that a claim for attorneys’ fees in a\n\ncivil-rights action, which is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b),\n\nis a single claim possessed by the client.     See Evans, 475 U.S.\n\nat 730 & n.19; Richards v. Reed, 611 F.2d 545, 546 & n.2 (5th\n\nCir. 1980).   Here, the parties settled the class’s attorneys’-\n\nfees claim along with the rest of this case.    We therefore reject\n\nMr. Chambliss’s assertion that he is entitled to proceed\n\nseparately regarding attorneys’ fees.   Further, until the\n\ndistrict court approves an allocation of the funds provided in\n\nthe settlement agreement for attorneys’ fees, we cannot review\n\nwhether Mr. Chambliss has received an appropriate share.\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n\n\ndetermine the allocation. Class counsel has proposed a division\nof the funds, which was negotiated and agreed to by five of the\nsix lawyers and firms that have represented the Private-Plaintiff\nclass. Only Mr. Chambliss neither participated in the\ndiscussions nor approved class counsel’s proposal, even though he\nwas repeatedly invited to participate in the negotiations.\nNevertheless, the proposed division includes a significant share\nfor Mr. Chambliss. It does not appear from the record that the\ndistrict court has ruled on the proposed allocation.\n\n                                  44\n\fAccordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                          45\n\f",

After nearly thirty\n\nyears of litigation, a settlement agreement has been reached\n\nbetween the Private Plaintiffs, the United States (which\n\nintervened in this action in support of the Private Plaintiffs),\n\nand the State of Mississippi.   Among other obligations, the\n\nagreement promises approximately $500 million in funding over\n\nseventeen years to remedy the present effects of Mississippi’s\n\npast policies of de jure segregation.     After conducting a hearing\n\non the fairness of the proposed settlement agreement and\n\nreceiving a concurrent resolution from the Mississippi\n\nLegislature supporting the proposal and agreeing to fund it, the\n\ndistrict court approved the settlement.\n\n     Dissatisfied with the relief provided for in the agreement,\n\n                                  2\n\fseveral of the Private Plaintiffs (“Appellants”) appeal to this\n\ncourt, asking us to reverse the district court’s decision and,\n\nthereby, to invalidate the settlement.       Appellants also desire to\n\nopt out of this class action and, thus, to continue litigating\n\nthis controversy.   Finally, Appellants’ attorney, who represented\n\nthe Private-Plaintiff class for many years, contends that he must\n\nbe permitted to proceed separately regarding his fees, even\n\nthough the settlement agreement provides a lump sum for the fees\n\nof all the attorneys who have represented the Private Plaintiffs.\n\n     We have reviewed Appellants’ objections to the settlement\n\nagreement, and we hold that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in approving it.    In addition, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court correctly denied Appellants’ motion to opt out of\n\nthe Private-Plaintiff class.    Finally, we reject the assertion of\n\nAppellants’ attorney that he is entitled to proceed separately\n\nregarding attorneys’ fees.    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                             I.

The\nhistorically black universities are Jackson State University,\nMississippi Valley State University, and Alcorn State University.\n\n                                   4\n\fbanc).\n\n     2.   The Supreme Court’s Decision\n\n     Reversing, the Supreme Court held that both this court and\n\nthe district court had applied an incorrect legal standard.      See\n\nUnited States v. Fordice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112782\"><a href=\"/opinion/112782/united-states-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729-32 (1992).    According\n\nto the Court’s opinion,\n\n     If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable\n     to its prior system that continue to have segregative\n     effects——whether by influencing student enrollment\n     decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of\n     the university system——and such policies are without\n     sound educational justification and can be practicably\n     eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of\n     proving that it has dismantled its prior system. Such\n     policies run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause, even\n     though the State has abolished the legal requirement that\n     whites and blacks be educated separately and has\n     established racially neutral policies not animated by a\n     discriminatory purpose.\n\nId. at 731-32.   In other words, the Court ruled that the Equal\n\nProtection Clause and Title VI4 require Mississippi to abolish\n\nany policy or practice that (1) is traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation, (2) continues to have segregative effects, (3) is\n\nwithout sound educational justification, and (4) can be\n\npracticably eliminated.\n\n     Having articulated the legal standard to be applied on\n\nremand, the Court closed with an important clarification:\n\n\n\n     4\n          The Supreme Court opined that “the reach of Title VI’s\nprotection extends no further than the Fourteenth Amendment,”\nthereby obviating the need to engage in distinct analyses.\nFordice, 505 U.S. at 732 n.7; accord Ayers, 111 F.3d at 1191 n.5.\n\n                                 5\n\f     If we understand [the Private Plaintiffs] to press us to\n     order the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and\n     Mississippi Valley State solely so that they may be\n     publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by private\n     choice, we reject that request. The State provides these\n     facilities for all its citizens and it has not met its\n     burden under Brown to take affirmative steps to dismantle\n     its prior de jure system . . . .\n\nId. at 743.   Thus, the Court affirmed that this litigation\n\nconcerns eliminating the effects of prior legal segregation, not\n\nmandating equality among Mississippi’s publicly funded\n\neducational institutions.

See Ayers v. Fordice,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2264344\"><a href=\"/opinion/2264344/ayers-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1477 (N.D. Miss. 1995).     To reform these\n\nareas, consistent with the Supreme Court’s emphasis on\n\neducational soundness and practicability, the district court\n\nissued a remedial decree, id. at 1494-96, and it ordered the\n\nestablishment of a three-person committee to monitor the\n\nimplementation of its decree.   Id. at 1494.    We describe below\n\nonly those provisions of the decree that bear on this appeal.\n\n     Regarding admissions standards, the court accepted the\n\n                                 6\n\fBoard’s proposed admissions policy, which remains in place today.\n\nId. at 1494 (accepting the Board’s proposed admissions policy);\n\nid. at 1477-79 (describing that policy).      Previously, admissions\n\nstandards were stricter at the historically white universities\n\nthan at the historically black universities, and the standards\n\nwere based almost exclusively on an applicant’s performance on\n\nthe American College Test (ACT).       See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734-\n\n35.   The prior admissions standards were a vestige of de jure\n\nsegregation that continued to have segregative effects: Because\n\nAfrican-American applicants as a class scored lower on the ACT\n\nthan white applicants, the standards effectively channeled black\n\nstudents to the historically black universities.         See Fordice,\n\n505 U.S. at 734-35.   Under the Board’s current policy, however,\n\nuniform standards govern admission to all of the State’s\n\nuniversities.   Ayers, 879 F. Supp. at 1477-78.     Also, rather than\n\nbeing based almost entirely on ACT scores, the current admissions\n\nstandards also take into account high school grades.         Id.\n\nFurther, applicants who do not meet the regular admissions\n\ncriteria can still gain admission through completion of a spring\n\nscreening process, which for some students leads to participation\n\nin a summer remedial program and further remedial instruction\n\nduring the regular academic year.      Id. at 1478-79.\n\n      The decree directed the implementation of the Board’s\n\nproposals for the development of additional academic programs at\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fJackson State, including programs in the field of allied health\n\nand graduate degrees in social work, urban planning, and\n\nbusiness.   Id. at 1494.   The court further instructed the Board\n\nto conduct an institutional study of Jackson State, involving\n\nexamination of the feasibility and educational soundness of\n\nproviding additional academic offerings there, such as an\n\nengineering school, a law school, and a pharmacy program.     Id. at\n\n1494-95.    Regarding Alcorn State, the district court ordered the\n\nestablishment of an MBA program at the school’s Natchez Center.\n\nId.   Additionally, the court ordered the Board to study whether\n\ndesegregation in the two state universities in the Mississippi\n\nDelta region——Delta State and Mississippi Valley State——could\n\nonly be achieved through consolidating the two institutions.       Id.\n\n      The remedial decree also directed the State to submit to the\n\nmonitoring committee a report addressing the practicability of\n\nhaving the State assume control over the facilities-maintenance\n\nfunds then controlled individually by each of the eight state\n\nuniversities.    Id.   The district court further instructed the\n\nBoard “to study the feasibility of establishing system-wide\n\ncoordination of the community colleges in the State in the areas\n\nof admissions standards and articulation procedures, and report\n\nto the Monitoring Committee” regarding its findings.5    Id. at\n\n\n      5\n          Although a separate lawsuit was underway regarding\nMississippi’s community-college system, the district court issued\nthese directions respecting the community colleges because\n\n                                   8\n\f1496.\n\n     4.   This Court’s 1997 Opinion\n\n     On appeal, while upholding most of the district court’s\n\ndecision, this court rejected a few of its conclusions, and we\n\nset forth several instructions to be followed on remand.    We\n\nfocus here only on those aspects of our 1997 opinion that are\n\nrelevant to this appeal.   We concluded that the district court\n\nerred in finding that the use of ACT cutoffs to award\n\nscholarships was not traceable to the de jure system and that\n\nthis policy did not continue to foster segregation.     Ayers v.\n\nFordice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).   Thus, we remanded for consideration of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming this aspect\n\nof the undergraduate scholarship policies at the historically\n\nwhite universities and of implementing, if necessary, appropriate\n\n\n\npolicies at those colleges impact access to the state-university\nsystem. See Ayers, 879 F. Supp. at 1474-75. Specifically, the\ndistrict court observed that the community colleges are in a\nposition to take students——who, upon graduation from high school,\nare not capable of succeeding at a four-year university——and to\nprepare them to transfer to a university and, thereby, to obtain\na four-year degree. Id. Because these under-prepared students\nwere often African-American, the court suggested that the\ncommunity colleges were a valuable resource for integrating the\nfour-year universities and for serving as an alternative route to\na bachelors degree for black students. Id. Finding that the\ncommunity colleges were not performing this task “to any great\ndegree,” the court therefore ordered the Board to study whether\nthe universities and the community colleges should coordinate\ntheir admissions requirements and remedial programs. Id. at\n1475.\n\n                                 9\n\fremedial relief.     Id. at 1209, 1228.   In addition, we directed\n\nthe district court to investigate the status of the Board’s\n\nproposal to consolidate Mississippi Valley State and Delta State.\n\nId. at 1214, 1228.    If the district court determined that the\n\nBoard planned not to merge the two schools, we instructed the\n\ncourt to order the Board to study other methods of desegregating\n\nMississippi Valley State, including adding academic programs at\n\nthat school.   Id.    We also concluded that the Board should report\n\nto the monitoring committee on new academic and land-grant\n\nprograms that would have a reasonable chance of increasing the\n\nnumber of non-African-American students attending Alcorn State.\n\nId. at 1214, 1228.    Additionally, we remanded the issue of\n\nequipment funding, asking the district court to investigate the\n\ncause and segregative effect of disparities between the money\n\nreceived by the historically white universities and the\n\nhistorically black universities and, if necessary, to implement\n\nappropriate relief.     Id. at 1225, 1228.   Finally, we instructed\n\nthe district court to monitor closely the effectiveness of the\n\nsummer remedial program.     Id. at 1228-29.   We indicated that the\n\nprogram should be reformed as necessary to achieve the objective\n\nof identifying and admitting students who are capable——with\n\nreasonable remediation——of performing at the university level,\n\nbut who fail to qualify for regular admission.      Id.\n\n     5.   Proceedings on Remand From Our 1997 Decision\n\n\n                                  10\n\f     Below we briefly review the aspects of the proceedings\n\nconducted and the orders issued by the district court on remand\n\nfrom our 1997 decision in this case that are relevant to this\n\nappeal.\n\n     In June 1998, the district court ruled that it would no\n\nlonger consider the consolidation of Mississippi Valley State and\n\nDelta State, since the Board had concluded that the merger was\n\nnot practical.     Thus, as we instructed it to do in our 1997\n\nopinion, the court directed the Board to study programs that\n\ncould be implemented at Mississippi Valley State to attract non-\n\nAfrican-American students.     Next, the district court found that\n\nthe Board was in the process of implementing a Ph.D. program in\n\nsocial work at Jackson State.     After observing that, in response\n\nto our 1997 decision, the Board had ceased using ACT scores as\n\nthe sole criterion for awarding scholarships, the district court\n\ninstructed the Board to submit information to the court and to\n\nthe Plaintiffs regarding the educational soundness of using ACT\n\nscores as one aspect of the scholarship-award criteria.\n\n     In August 1998, the district court appointed a monitor to\n\naid the court and the parties in implementing the remedial\n\ndecree: Dr. Jerry Boone, a former state university administrator\n\nfrom Tennessee.6\n\n\n     6\n          The court amended its previous order that had provided\nfor a three-person monitoring committee. To the extent that\nAppellants now contend that either the district court’s selection\n\n                                  11\n\f     In October 1999, the district court ruled that the Board had\n\nfully complied with several of its obligations concerning Jackson\n\nState.   After considering the monitor’s status report, the court\n\nconcluded that the Board had implemented academic programs in\n\nallied health, social work (Ph.D.), urban planning (masters and\n\nPh.D.), and business (Ph.D.) at Jackson State.   The court also\n\nnoted that the Board had conducted an institutional study of\n\nJackson State and had prepared to establish an engineering school\n\nat the university.   Accordingly, the court stated that the Board\n\n\n\nof a sole monitor or the identity of the individual selected to\nserve as the monitor requires us to invalidate the parties’\nsettlement, we reject their contention. Approximately six months\nafter we handed down our 1997 decision in this case, the district\ncourt ordered each side to submit six names from which the court\nwould select the monitoring committee. In the opinion\naccompanying its order, the court noted that the parties’ failure\nto agree on the membership of the monitoring committee was\ndelaying the implementation of the remedial decree. At that\ntime, the Private Plaintiffs, who were represented by Alvin\nChambliss (attorney for Appellants here), were busy seeking\nSupreme Court review of our 1997 decision. Consequently, counsel\nfor the Private Plaintiffs chose not to address the issues then\npending in the trial court, such as the composition of the\nmonitoring committee. At the district court’s direction, the\nUnited States submitted names of candidates for the monitoring\ncommittee on behalf of both itself and the Private Plaintiffs.\nApproximately two-and-a-half months after the district court’s\ndeadline for the submission of candidates had passed, the Private\nPlaintiffs filed a motion requesting access to the list of\ncandidates submitted by the Defendants, but it does not appear\nthat the Private Plaintiffs ever sought to submit their own list\nof candidates. While the record does not reflect precisely why\nthe district court——faced with the parties’ inability to agree on\nthe committee’s composition——eventually decided to appoint only\none monitor, we cannot conclude that the court’s action requires\nus to invalidate the present settlement. Further, we reject\nAppellants’ unsupported attacks on Dr. Boone’s qualifications to\nserve as the court-appointed monitor.\n\n                                12\n\fhad complied with most of its duties regarding new academic\n\nprograms at Jackson State.\n\n     In July 1999, the district court ruled that the Board had\n\ncomplied with the paragraph of the remedial decree concerning\n\ncoordination of admissions standards and establishment of\n\narticulation agreements between the State’s community colleges\n\nand its universities.   The court found that Mississippi’s\n\ncommunity colleges had approved an open-admissions policy.\n\nFurther, the court observed that the Board had standardized “an\n\nalternative procedure for students to qualify for university\n\nadmission by completing specified requirements at a community\n\ncollege.”   The court also noted that, under the Board’s policy,\n\nstudents who unsuccessfully attempt the summer remedial program\n\nare counseled regarding community-college enrollment.\n\n     In July 2000, the district court approved the Mississippi\n\nLegislature’s appropriation of funds to construct a facility to\n\nhouse the court-ordered MBA program at Alcorn State’s Natchez\n\ncampus.   See Ayers v. Fordice, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, 2000 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 9877, at *9 (N.D. Miss. July 6, 2000).\n\n     In January 2001, the district court issued an order\n\nregarding legal and pharmacy education at Jackson State.     Finding\n\nno unmet demand for legal education in the Jackson area, the\n\ncourt concluded that the Board need not establish a law school at\n\nJackson State for the purpose of desegregating that institution.\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fThe district court also found that the existing pharmacy program\n\nat the University of Mississippi was meeting the State’s need for\n\npharmacy education.   It further ruled that the creation of either\n\na law school or a pharmacy school at Jackson State was neither\n\nfeasible nor educationally sound.7     The district court then\n\nannounced that “[w]ith these issues resolved, the court finds\n\nthat all elements of the Ayers Remedial Decree having to do with\n\nJackson State University and involving significant expenditures\n\nof funds have now been completed.”\n\n     In February 2001, the district court concluded that the\n\nBoard’s proposal regarding facilities-maintenance funds\n\nessentially satisfied this aspect of the remedial decree.\n\n     To summarize the status of this litigation when the district\n\ncourt was presented with the proposed settlement agreement, most\n\nof both the district court’s remedial decree and our instructions\n\non remand had been implemented.    Thus, only the following issues\n\nremained to some extent unresolved: (1) further review of the\n\nuniform admissions standards;8 (2) continued evaluation of the\n\n     7\n          But, while noting that such a program was not required\nby the court’s remedial decree, the district court approved the\nBoard’s proposal for an inter-institutional pharmacy program,\njointly controlled by Jackson State, the University of\nMississippi, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\n     8\n          In June 1998, the district court ordered the Board to\nmonitor freshman enrollment statewide to assess the impact of the\nuniform admissions standards. The district court had scheduled a\nhearing on the admissions standards, but it was postponed pending\nsettlement negotiations. In his analysis of enrollment data from\n1993-1998, the monitor reported “a substantial and fairly steady\n\n                                  14\n\fsummer remedial program;9 (3) investigation of potential new\n\nacademic programs that might help to desegregate Mississippi\n\nValley State and Alcorn State; (4) assessment of equipment\n\nfunding; and (5) consideration of the use of ACT scores as a\n\ncomponent of the criteria for awarding scholarships.\n\nB.   Proceedings Concerning the Settlement Agreement\n\n     1.   The Settlement Agreement\n\n     After lengthy negotiations, all of the Defendants, the\n\n\nincrease in total freshmen enrollments, universities and\ncommunity colleges combined, among resident black students.” But\nhe also noted that African-American freshmen were “drift[ing]\naway from the universities and toward the community colleges.”\nIn addition, the monitor cautioned against placing too much\nweight on the data, pointing out that his analysis dealt only\nwith numbers from three years before and three years after the\nuniform admissions standards were instituted.\n     9\n          The monitor also reported to the district court on the\neffectiveness of the summer remedial program. The monitor’s\nassessment of the program was quite positive; he concluded:\n“Overall, I believe the spring screening and summer remedial\nprogram should be regarded as a success for those who attend the\nsummer program. Most of the students who go through it complete\nit successfully and go on to attend one of the universities in\nthe fall.” Further, he noted that there had been “no reduction\nin black students attending college since the summer program was\ninitiated, although a larger proportion are choosing to attend a\ncommunity college,” a result which did not trouble the monitor\n“because transfer arrangements between the universities and the\ncommunity colleges make initial enrollment in a community college\na clear alternative for university-bound students who prefer not\nto go through the summer program.” Noting that many of the\nrejected applicants who did not participate in the spring\nscreening process and the summer remedial program were apparently\nunaware of the programs’ existence, the monitor recommended that\nthe Board should be required to ensure that students who do not\nqualify for regular admission are adequately informed about the\nspring screening process and the summer remedial program,\nincluding the availability of financial aid for participants.\n\n                               15\n\fUnited States, and the lead Private Plaintiff (Congressman Bennie\n\nThompson),10 on behalf of both himself and the Private-Plaintiff\n\nclass, reached a settlement agreement.   By its terms, “[j]udicial\n\napproval of [the] Agreement is to relieve the Board, and all\n\nother defendants, of any further obligations under the remedial\n\ndecree.”   Further, the “only obligations of the Board, and other\n\ndefendants, arising out of or related to the Ayers litigation\n\nwill be those specified in [the] Agreement.”    We describe below\n\nthe major obligations contained in the Agreement.\n\n           a.   Financial Assistance for the Summer Remedial\n                Program\n\n     Under the agreement, the State will provide special funding\n\nin the amount of $500,000 annually for five years (from 2002-\n\n2006) and $750,000 annually for five additional years (from 2007-\n\n2011) to supplement the need-based financial aid presently\n\navailable to summer program participants.11    Further, the\n\nagreement obligates the Board to “widely” publicize both the\n\nopportunity to enroll in the summer remedial program and the\n\n\n\n\n     10\n          Congressman Thompson is one of the twenty-one original\nnamed plaintiffs in this suit, and in March 2000, the district\ncourt designated——for “purposes of efficient communications and\norganization”——Congressman Thompson as the “lead plaintiff” in\nthis action.\n     11\n          The Board, however, “specifically reserves the right to\nno longer provide the summer program at certain Mississippi\nuniversities should future circumstances so warrant.”\n\n                                16\n\favailability of financial aid for program participants.12\n\n          b.   Academic Programs\n\n     The agreement provides for the establishment, continuation,\n\nor enhancement of a variety of academic programs at Alcorn State,\n\nJackson State, and Mississippi Valley State.13   Further,\n\n\n     12\n          This provision is directly responsive to the monitor’s\nrecommendation that the Board adequately inform students who are\ndenied regular admission about the summer program and the\nfinancial aid available to those who participate in it.\n     13\n          The specific programs or program areas named in the\nagreement are detailed below. When a particular program is being\nor will be provided at a branch campus, that information is\nindicated parenthetically.\n     Alcorn State: (1) business administration, masters (Natchez\ncampus); (2) accounting, masters (Natchez campus); (3) finance,\nbachelors (Lorman campus) and masters (Natchez campus);\n(4) physician assistants, masters (Natchez campus or Vicksburg\ncampus); (5) biotechnology, masters (Lorman campus); (6) computer\nnetworking, bachelors (Vicksburg campus); (7) environmental\nscience, bachelors (Lorman campus); (8) nursing; (9) teacher\neducation; (10) mathematics and sciences (biology, chemistry,\nphysics); and (11) computer science.\n     Jackson State: (1) business, Ph.D.; (2) urban planning,\nmasters and Ph.D.; (3) social work, Ph.D.; (4) civil engineering,\nbachelors; (5) computer engineering, bachelors;\n(6) telecommunications engineering, bachelors; (7) public health,\nmasters; (8) health care administration, bachelors;\n(9) communicative disorders, masters; (10) higher education,\nPh.D.; (11) public health, Ph.D.; (12) Mississippi\nInterinstitutional Pharmacy Initiative; (13) school of allied\nhealth; (14) school of public health; (15) school of engineering\n(graduate programs in civil, computer, and telecommunications\nengineering will be considered for implementation upon\naccreditation of the baccalaureate engineering programs);\n(16) business; and (17) education.\n     Mississippi Valley State: (1) history, bachelors;\n(2) special education, masters and bachelors; (3) computer\nscience, masters; (4) bioinformatics, masters; (5) leadership\nadministration, masters; (6) business administration, masters;\n(7) biology; (8) chemistry; (9) computer science;\n(10) mathematics; and (11) special education.\n\n                                17\n\fbeginning with fiscal year 2002, annual appropriations are to be\n\nprovided to the historically black universities for seventeen\n\nyears, in the total amount of $245,880,000, to fund the numerous\n\nacademic programs detailed in the agreement.14\n\n          c.   Endowments\n\n     The agreement establishes both a publicly funded and a\n\nprivately funded endowment for the benefit of Alcorn State,\n\nJackson State, and Mississippi Valley State.     Mississippi will\n\ncreate the public endowment, which will consist of $70 million,\n\nover the course of fourteen years.   Additionally, the agreement\n\nrequires the Board to use its best efforts over a seven-year\n\nperiod to raise $35 million for the privately funded endowment.\n\n     Initially, the endowments will be managed by a seven-person\n\ncommittee composed of the presidents of the historically black\n\nuniversities, the Commissioner of Higher Education, two members\n\nof the Board, and a member to be agreed on by the other members.\n\n\n\n     14\n          The agreement also states that,\n     The Board will maintain the right to evaluate program\n     implementation in light of program objectives including\n     reservation of the right to direct reallocation of\n     monies, in consultation with the presidents of the\n     historically black universities, to other academic\n     programs and other-race endeavors identified in this\n     Agreement. Given the considerable period of time covered\n     by this Agreement, the Board further reserves the right\n     to substitute academic programs, in consultation with the\n     presidents of the historically black universities, for\n     those presently identified should future circumstances so\n     warrant.\n\n\n                                18\n\fThe income from both endowments will be allocated 28.3% to Alcorn\n\nState, 43.4% to Jackson State, and 28.3% to Mississippi Valley\n\nState, with the schools being required to use the funds for\n\nother-race15 marketing and recruitment, including the employment\n\nof other-race recruiting personnel and the award of other-race\n\nstudent scholarships.      The schools may also expend the endowment\n\nincome on the academic programs provided for in the agreement.\n\n     Alcorn State, Jackson State, and Mississippi Valley State\n\nwill each receive its pro rata share of the endowments when the\n\ninstitution attains a total other-race enrollment of ten percent\n\nand sustains that enrollment for three consecutive years.      After\n\nobtaining full control over the endowment funds, the historically\n\nblack universities may use the income for “sound academic\n\npurposes such as faculty compensation, academic program\n\nenhancements and student scholarships.”\n\n            d.   Capital Improvements\n\n     The agreement authorizes various capital improvements, at a\n\ntotal cost of up to $75 million, at Alcorn State, Jackson State,\n\nand Mississippi Valley State.\n\n            e.   Funding\n\n     According to the agreement, the funding necessary to\n\nimplement the agreement’s provisions supplements the usual\n\n\n\n     15\n            The agreement defines “other-race” as non-African-\nAmerican.\n\n                                   19\n\fappropriations made to the state-university system and does not\n\nsupplant normal funding for Alcorn State, Jackson State, and\n\nMississippi Valley State.\n\n          f.    Recognition of Jackson State as a Comprehensive\n                University\n\n     Acknowledging that Jackson State presently offers a broad\n\narray of academic programs and that its service area extends\n\nbeyond the Jackson, Mississippi, metropolitan area, the Board\n\nagrees that Jackson State should be “recognized as a\n\ncomprehensive university.”   The additional programs, facilities,\n\nand other resources to which comprehensive recognition entitles\n\nJackson State are those provided for in the agreement.\n\n          g.    Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Under the agreement, the attorneys for the Private\n\nPlaintiffs will receive a total of $2.5 million for fees, costs,\n\nand expenses.   Additionally, the agreement states that\n\n     The class representative (Congressman Thompson) and Class\n     counsel Byrd, Derfner and Pressman specifically represent\n     that North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, The Center\n     for Law and Education, and Alvin O. Chambliss, Jr. have\n     knowledge of these provisions (i) that the Ayers\n     defendants’ obligations for attorneys’ fees, costs and\n     expenses will be fully satisfied on payment of $2,500,000\n     . . . and (ii) that no present or former counsel for the\n     Class, or member of the Class, may seek attorneys’ fees,\n     costs and expenses other than as set forth in this\n     Agreement.\n\n          h.    Settlement Implementation\n\n     The agreement obligates the Board to report annually to lead\n\ncounsel for the Private Plaintiffs and counsel for the United\n\n                                  20\n\fStates on the agreement’s implementation.     In addition, it\n\nexpresses the parties’ decision to submit to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the district court any dispute relating to the\n\nagreement.    Also, the agreement will not become final until its\n\napproval is no longer subject to further appeal or judicial\n\nreview.\n\n     2.    Appellants’ Motion to Opt Out\n\n     Unhappy with the relief provided for in the agreement,\n\nAppellants filed a motion to opt out of the Private-Plaintiff\n\nclass.    After holding a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district\n\ncourt denied their motion.     See Ayers v.

The District Court’s Approval of the Settlement\n           Agreement\n\n     Several months after it ordered that notice of the proposed\n\nsettlement be published in newspapers throughout Mississippi, the\n\ndistrict court conducted a fairness hearing, receiving testimony\n\nfrom proponents of and objectors to the settlement.     See Ayers v.\n\nMusgrove, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">91895</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D.

Id. at *4.   But it worried\n\nthat none of the parties involved had the authority to\n\nappropriate the substantial sum necessary to fund the proposal.\n\nId. at *4.    Accordingly, the district court stated that——if the\n\nMississippi Legislature would endorse the agreement and agree to\n\nfund it——the court would approve the settlement.      Id. at *5.\n\n     After the district court received a concurrent resolution\n\nevidencing the Legislature’s support for and agreement to fund\n\nthe settlement, the court issued a final judgment approving the\n\nsettlement.

It is not illegal to do more than that\n     required by the Constitution.\n\nAyers v. Musgrove, No. 4:75CV009-B-D, slip op. at 2 (N.D. Miss.\n\nFeb. 15, 2002).    The court’s decision, inter alia, specified that\n\n(1) this suit is a class action certified under Rule 23(b)(2);\n\n(2) the settlement agreement is incorporated by reference into\n\nthe final judgment; (3) the agreement “affords the Class Members\n\nconsiderable relief in light of the established law of this case,\n\nthe present stage of these proceedings and the range of possible\n\nrecovery through further litigation, and is, in all respects,\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\ffair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interest of the\n\nClass”; and (4) all claims relating to this controversy are\n\ndismissed with prejudice.17   Id. at 2-4.   In addition to\n\nappealing the district court’s final judgment approving the\n\nsettlement, Appellants challenge the district court’s denial of\n\ntheir motion to opt out of the Private-Plaintiff class.18\n\n                      II.

The District Court’s Approval of the Settlement Agreement\n\n     A district court has discretion to approve a class-action\n\nsettlement under Rule 23(e) if the settlement is fair, adequate,\n\nand reasonable.   Parker, 667 F.2d at 1208-09.   Our cases instruct\n\nthat the district court’s “exercise of discretion is to be tested\n\nby inquiries that ‘ensure that the settlement is in the interest\n\nof the class, does not unfairly impinge on the rights and\n\ninterests of dissenters, and does not merely mantle oppression.’”\n\nReed, 703 F.2d at 172 (quoting Pettway v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"356027\"><a href=\"/opinion/356027/17-fair-emplpraccas-1712-17-empl-prac-dec-p-8470-rush-pettway-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214 (5th Cir. 1978)).    Further, six factors guide\n\nour review of a decision to approve a settlement agreement\n\nresolving a class-action suit:\n\n     (1) the existence of fraud or collusion behind the\n     settlement; (2) the complexity, expense and likely\n     duration of the litigation; (3) the stage of the\n     proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;\n     (4) the probability of plaintiffs’ success on the merits;\n     (5) the range of possible recovery; and (6) the opinions\n     of the class counsel, class representatives, and absent\n     class members.\n\nId. (citing Parker, 667 F.2d at 1209).    Accordingly, we focus\n\n                                 24\n\fbelow on the Parker factors, and we also address both Appellants’\n\ninadequate-representation contention and their challenge to the\n\nagreement’s provision regarding attorneys’ fees.\n\n     1.   Fraud or Collusion\n\n     Appellants’ brief contains several vague assertions of\n\ncollusion.   Primarily, Appellants claim that they had\n\ninsufficient access to and participation in the settlement\n\nnegotiations.   Further, they suggest that collusion occurred in\n\nthe negotiation of attorneys’ fees.\n\n     It is unclear why Appellants’ attorney, Alvin Chambliss (who\n\nrepresented the Private-Plaintiff class for many years), did not\n\nparticipate in the settlement negotiations.    The lead Private\n\nPlaintiff, Congressman Thompson, testified at the fairness\n\nhearing that every effort was made to keep Mr. Chambliss informed\n\nregarding the negotiations.    Further, letters and\n\nfacsimiles——indicating correspondence between lead counsel for\n\nthe class and Mr. Chambliss concerning the settlement talks——were\n\npresented as exhibits at the fairness hearing.    Regardless, the\n\ndistrict court found Appellants’ allegations of collusion to be\n\nunsupported.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">19730</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16.\n\nBecause Appellants have pointed to no record evidence that\n\ncontradicts this finding——let alone evidence showing it to be\n\nclearly erroneous——we reject their contention that collusion was\n\npresent in the settlement negotiations.\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\f     2.    The Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the\n           Suit and the Stage of the Proceedings\n\n     The second and third Parker factors——the complexity,\n\nexpense, and likely duration of the litigation and the stage of\n\nthe proceedings and the amount of discovery completed——weigh in\n\nfavor of affirming the district court’s decision.      First,\n\nregarding the second factor, settling now avoids the risks and\n\nburdens of potentially protracted litigation concerning several\n\naspects of our remand instructions and the district court’s\n\nremedial decree.     See supra notes 8-9 and accompanying text\n\n(describing five issues that were not fully resolved when the\n\nparties reached their agreement).      Specifically, settlement\n\neliminates the transaction costs that further proceedings would\n\nimpose on the process of desegregating Mississippi’s state-\n\nuniversity system.    The agreement also provides relief for the\n\nclass sooner than continued litigation would.\n\n     Second, examination of the stage of the proceedings and the\n\namount of discovery completed weighs in favor of upholding the\n\nsettlement.   The several trials and appeals that have already\n\noccurred in this case have largely resolved the controlling legal\n\nissues.   Thus, the parties and the district court possess ample\n\ninformation with which to evaluate the merits of the competing\n\npositions.\n\n     3.    Likelihood of Success on the Merits and Range of\n           Possible Recovery\n\n\n                                  26\n\f     Because two trials and several appeals have already occurred\n\nin this case, the probability of the Plaintiffs’ success on the\n\nmerits and the range of possible recovery have largely been\n\nresolved.    Our 1997 opinion conclusively determined nearly all of\n\nthe State’s obligations.19    Most of our instructions to the\n\ndistrict court in that opinion concerned the remedial decree, see\n\nAyers, 111 F.3d at 1228-29, and as discussed above, the district\n\ncourt concluded——before the parties reached their\n\nsettlement——that much of the remedial decree had been\n\nsatisfied.20\n\n     Nevertheless, aside from their allegations of collusion,\n\nAppellants’ main objections to the settlement agreement center on\n\ntheir view that the relief it provides is inadequate.     Appellants\n\nprimarily seek more money for academic programs and facilities at\n\nthe historically black universities and lower admissions\n\nstandards.     But they also object to the requirement that the\n\n\n     19\n          Appellants claim that Mississippi, in dismantling its\nformer system of de jure segregation, has not complied with Title\nVI and several regulations and policies promulgated in accordance\nwith that statute. But their reliance on Title VI and its\nimplementing regulations is unavailing because Mississippi’s\nobligations have been determined under the Fourteenth Amendment;\nboth the Supreme Court and this court have stated that the\nrequirements of Title VI extend no further than those of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Fordice, 505 U.S. at 732 n.7; Ayers, 111\nF.3d at 1191 n.5.\n     20\n          To the extent that Appellants allege that the district\ncourt disregarded our 1997 remand instructions, we reject their\ncontention. Appellants do not direct us to anything in the\nrecord that would support such an assertion.\n\n                                  27\n\fhistorically black universities reach and sustain an other-race\n\nenrollment of ten percent before gaining full control over the\n\nendowments created by the settlement agreement.   Additionally,\n\nAppellants assert that the agreement does not adequately address\n\ninstitutional mission designations,21 faculty\n\nsalaries, governance, accreditation, and the allocation of land-\n\ngrant functions between Alcorn State and Mississippi State\n\nUniversity.   We address each of Appellants’ specific contentions\n\nin turn below and explain why Appellants are unlikely to achieve\n\ngreater relief through further litigation.\n\n     Concerning Appellants’ desire for more funding for and\n\n\n\n     21\n          In 1981, the Board assigned missions to the state\nuniversities in Mississippi. Ayers, 674 F. Supp. at 1539. A\nuniversity’s “mission” defines the institution’s “role and scope”\nrelative to the other institutions within the system. Id. The\nBoard designated the University of Mississippi, Mississippi\nState, and the University of Southern Mississippi as\n“comprehensive” universities. Id. This designation indicates\nthat these institutions offered a greater number and higher level\nof degree programs than did the remaining universities and that\nthese schools were expected to offer a number of doctoral\nprograms, but not in the same disciplines. Id. Jackson State\nwas classified as an “urban” university, indicating that its role\nwas to serve the urban community of Jackson, Mississippi. Id. at\n1539-40. Mississippi Valley State, Alcorn State, Mississippi\nUniversity for Women, and Delta State received the designation of\n“regional” university. Id. at 1540. The regional designation\nsignifies that these institutions were expected to focus on the\nprovision of undergraduate education. Id.\n     While the agreement provides for the recognition of Jackson\nState as a comprehensive university, it also states that Jackson\nState’s “use of the comprehensive description does not imply any\nchange in [its] institutional mission classification.\nInstitutional mission designations are not being addressed by\nthis Agreement.”\n\n                                28\n\fprograms at the historically black universities, our 1997\n\ndecision affirmed the district court’s finding that “merely\n\nadding programs and increasing budgets is not likely to\n\ndesegregate” a historically black university.      Ayers, 111 F.3d at\n\n1213 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAdditionally, we upheld the district court’s determination that\n\nthe State’s funding formula is not traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.     Id. at 1224-25.   While we did instruct the district\n\ncourt to investigate potential programmatic enhancements at\n\nAlcorn State and Mississippi Valley State for the purpose of\n\ndesegregating those schools, id. at 1228, the settlement\n\nagreement makes ample provision for academic offerings at both\n\nuniversities.    Further, testimony of the Board’s witnesses at the\n\nfairness hearing indicates that many of these programs were\n\nselected in accordance with our guidance that “well-planned\n\nprograms that respond to the particular needs and interests of\n\nlocal populations can help to desegregate historically black\n\ninstitutions.”    Id. at 1213-14.\n\n     As discussed above, several new academic programs have also\n\nbeen added at Jackson State, and the settlement agreement\n\nprovides for the continuation of these programs in addition to\n\nthe implementation of several new programs.     Appellants\n\nnonetheless assert that the settlement should be invalidated\n\nbecause programs in law, pharmacy, engineering, and public health\n\n\n\n                                    29\n\fhave not been established at Jackson State.     Further, they\n\ncontend that Jackson State should have partial control over the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center, located in Jackson,\n\nMississippi.\n\n     Each of Appellants’ contentions has been addressed by prior\n\ncourt rulings.    First, the district court found, in its January\n\n2001 order discussed above, that placing either a law school or a\n\npharmacy school at Jackson State was neither feasible nor\n\neducationally sound; moreover, no party even sought such steps at\n\nthe time of the district court’s ruling.22     Second, in the same\n\norder, the district court noted that an engineering school and a\n\nmasters in public health program have already been implemented at\n\nJackson State, and the settlement agreement provides continued\n\nfunding for these offerings as well as funding for a school of\n\npublic health at Jackson State.      Third, regarding the University\n\nof Mississippi Medical Center, our 1997 decision affirmed the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that institutional affiliation between\n\nJackson State and the Medical Center had no desegregative\n\npotential.     Id. at 1211, 1215.\n\n     Regarding facilities at the historically black universities,\n\nour 1997 opinion also rejected “Plaintiffs’ argument for general\n\n\n\n     22\n          An inter-institutional pharmacy program, over which\nJackson State has partial control, was developed, however, and\nthe settlement agreement provides for the continuation of that\nprogram.\n\n                                    30\n\ffunds to enhance facilities” at these schools.    Id. at 1224.\n\nStill, the settlement agreement provides up to $75 million for\n\ncapital improvements at the historically black universities,\n\nincluding acquisition of property, construction of new buildings\n\nand repairs and renovation of existing ones, purchase of\n\nadditional equipment, and landscaping and drainage installation.\n\nIn addition, in its February 2001 order discussed above, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the Board had essentially satisfied\n\nits obligation under the remedial decree to assume greater\n\ncontrol over funds for facilities maintenance.\n\n     Turning to Appellants’ contentions respecting the current\n\nadmissions policy, their hope for lower admissions standards also\n\ncannot be reconciled with our 1997 opinion, which specifically\n\napproved the district court’s adoption of uniform admissions\n\nstandards that are rigorous enough to exclude students incapable\n\nof succeeding at the university level.    See id. at 1198-1200.   In\n\nparticular, we affirmed the district court’s finding that the\n\nopen admissions component of the standards then (and, apparently,\n\nagain now) sought by the Private Plaintiffs was educationally\n\nunsound.23   Id. at 1199.   We did, however, instruct the district\n\n\n     23\n          At oral argument, Appellants advocated a return to\ntiered admissions standards, with the historically white\nuniversities employing stricter admissions criteria than the\nhistorically black universities. Appellants fail to recognize,\nhowever, that the Supreme Court condemned that prior policy as a\nvestige of de jure segregation with continued discriminatory\neffects. See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734-35.\n\n                                  31\n\fcourt to review the efficacy of the spring screening process and\n\nthe summer remedial program.    See id. at 1201, 1228-29.      As\n\ndiscussed above, the court-appointed monitor’s reports indicate\n\nthat the summer program has been a success.     Further, the\n\nsettlement agreement responds to the monitor’s primary\n\nrecommendation regarding the summer program——i.e., that the\n\nprogram, and the availability of financial aid for participants,\n\nshould be adequately publicized by the Board.\n\n     We also reject Appellants’ objection to the requirement that\n\neach of the historically black universities achieve and maintain\n\nten-percent other-race enrollment before receiving its share of\n\nthe endowments.    As the United States explains in its brief, the\n\nten-percent threshold seeks to ensure that the historically black\n\nuniversities devote the endowment funds to promoting the\n\ndesegregation of their schools, not to upgrading them “so that\n\nthey may be publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by\n\nprivate choice.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.   This provision will\n\nnot encourage the historically black universities to discriminate\n\nin admitting students because the current admissions standards\n\nare uniform across the state-university system; the schools lack\n\ndiscretion to deny entry to those applicants who meet the uniform\n\ncriteria.   Instead, the ten-percent threshold will provide the\n\nhistorically black universities with a legitimate incentive to\n\n\n\n\n                                 32\n\frecruit and to attract other-race students.24\n\n     In addition, Appellants’ complaint that institutional\n\nmission designations should have been addressed in the agreement\n\nis not well taken.   In our 1997 opinion we observed that the\n\ndistrict court’s remedial decree “does not order any alteration\n\nof the mission designations,” and we further noted that “[n]o\n\nparty appeals retention of the mission designations per se.”\n\nAyers, 111 F.3d at 1211.   But, even if we were to reconsider this\n\nissue now, the extensive programmatic enhancements at the\n\nhistorically black universities that have been implemented thus\n\nfar and will be established as a result of the agreement are\n\nintended to remedy the present segregative effects of this\n\nparticular vestige of de jure segregation.   Cf. id. at 1213 (“The\n\nissue of programmatic enhancement directly implicates policies\n\ngoverning institutional missions, which the district court found\n\nto be traceable to the de jure system and to have current\n\nsegregative effects.”).\n\n     Finally, turning to Appellants’ last four areas of concern,\n\nour 1997 decision affirmed the district court’s 1995 rulings that\n\nno relief was warranted to remedy disparities in the salaries,\n\nthe hiring, or the promotion of African-American faculty, id. at\n\n\n\n     24\n          Moreover, we note that the ten-percent threshold\nresponds to the monitor’s observation that the historically white\nuniversities have been desegregating faster than the historically\nblack universities.\n\n                                33\n\f1226-27; to modify the composition of the Board or its staff, id.\n\nat 1227-28; to address the Board’s efforts regarding the\n\naccreditation of academic programs at the historically black\n\nuniversities,25 id. at 1214-15; or to re-allocate land-grant\n\nresponsibilities between Alcorn State and Mississippi State\n\nUniversity, id. at 1217.\n\n     Accordingly, both the probability of the Plaintiffs’ success\n\non the merits and the range of possible recovery point strongly\n\nin favor of affirming.   Rejection of the settlement and further\n\nlitigation is unlikely to lead to greater relief for the Private-\n\nPlaintiff class, particularly since most of the relief sought by\n\nAppellants has been foreclosed by our 1997 decision in this case.\n\nThe settlement agreement provides meaningful relief; in\n\nparticular, it contains generous funding for (1) a variety of new\n\nand enhanced academic programs at the historically black\n\nuniversities and (2) financial aid for participants in the summer\n\nremedial program——a program lauded by the court-appointed\n\nmonitor——to assist those denied admission under the current\n\nuniform standards.   Further, we reiterate that the targeted\n\nprogrammatic enhancements provided for in the agreement are\n\nintended to promote desegregation at the historically black\n\n\n\n     25\n          We did, however, instruct the district court to ensure\nthat the then-existing business programs at Jackson State\nreceived accreditation. In June 1998, the district court\ndetermined that this step had been achieved.\n\n                                34\n\funiversities.    To the extent that Appellants “press us to order\n\nthe upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Mississippi\n\nValley State solely so that they may be publicly financed,\n\nexclusively black enclaves by private choice,” the Supreme Court\n\nhas rejected their contention.     Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.\n\n     4.   The Opinions of the Class Counsel, Class\n          Representatives, and Absent Class Members\n\n     Appellants also assert that reversal is required because\n\nmany class members oppose the settlement agreement.26    Our\n\njurisprudence, however, makes clear that a settlement can be\n\napproved despite opposition from class members, including named\n\nplaintiffs.     See Reed, 703 F.2d at 174-75 (affirming the district\n\ncourt’s approval of a settlement despite “the objections of\n\ntwenty-three of twenty-seven named plaintiffs and nearly forty\n\npercent of the 1,517 member class”); Parker, 667 F.2d at 1207-08,\n\n1214 (affirming a district court’s approval of a settlement of a\n\nclass-action suit even though nine of the eleven named plaintiffs\n\nopposed the settlement); Cotton v. Hinton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348294\"><a href=\"/opinion/348294/15-fair-emplpraccas-1342-15-empl-prac-dec-p-7864-hollie-cotton-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1331\n\n(5th Cir. 1977) (“A settlement can be fair notwithstanding a\n\nlarge number of class members who oppose it.”).

But, while\nthe record indicates that several class members oppose the\nsettlement, the number does not appear to be anywhere near 4,000.\nAccording to the district court’s opinion regarding Appellants’\nmotion to opt out of the class, ninety-nine Private Plaintiffs\nsought to opt out. Ayers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">19730</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1.\n\n                                  35\n\fclass members desire broader relief, which has been foreclosed by\n\nprior court rulings, does not prevent judicial approval of this\n\nsettlement agreement, which promises substantial relief to the\n\nclass.\n\n     5.   Inadequate Representation\n\n     Appellants also argue that the district court erred in\n\napproving the settlement because the class was not adequately\n\nrepresented during the settlement negotiations.   Mr. Chambliss,\n\nRobert Pressman, and Armand Derfner have represented the Private\n\nPlaintiffs for many years.   In March 2000, attorneys from the law\n\nfirm of Byrd and Associates entered an appearance on behalf of\n\nthe Private Plaintiffs, which was “acknowledged and agreed to” by\n\nMr. Chambliss.   Later that month, the district court designated\n\nCongressman Thompson as the lead plaintiff.   In May 2000, in\n\nresponse to an order from the district court, Congressman\n\nThompson named Isaac Byrd and Byrd’s law firm as lead counsel for\n\nthe Private Plaintiffs.   Still, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Pressman, and\n\nMr. Derfner continued to represent the Private-Plaintiff class.27\n\n     It appears that Mr. Byrd and his firm took the lead in\n\nnegotiating the settlement agreement on behalf of the Private\n\nPlaintiffs.   In their brief, Appellants criticize Congressman\n\nThompson’s and Mr. Byrd’s representation of the class during the\n\n\n     27\n          Mr. Pressman and Mr. Derfner, in addition to Mr. Byrd,\ncurrently represent the Private-Plaintiff Appellees in this\nappeal.\n\n                                36\n\fsettlement negotiations.    In particular, Appellants note that Mr.\n\nByrd is primarily a plaintiffs’ personal-injury lawyer and is\n\ninexperienced in civil-rights litigation.\n\n     In Reed, this court noted that “adequacy of representation\n\nand adequacy of settlement are different sides of the same\n\nquestion.”28    703 F.2d at 175.   Further, we stated that “the\n\nsettlement itself provides insight into adequacy of\n\nrepresentation.”    Id.; accord Parker, 667 F.2d at 1211 (stating\n\nthat “generally an attorney who secures and submits a fair and\n\nadequate settlement has represented the client class fairly and\n\nadequately”).    Here, the district court concluded that the\n\nsettlement agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and our\n\nanalysis of the agreement in the context of the Parker factors\n\nreveals no abuse of discretion by the district judge.       We also\n\nobserved in Reed that “it is the trial judge who can best know\n\nhow well the class was represented.”     703 F.2d at 175.    Here, the\n\ndistrict court found “the allegations of inadequate\n\nrepresentation of class members wholly unsubstantiated.”29\n\n     28\n          Indeed, Appellants’ complaints about the representation\nprovided by Congressman Thompson center on their disagreement\nwith his view that the settlement agreement is satisfactory.\n     29\n          In its order naming Thompson lead plaintiff, the\ndistrict court remarked that he “is one of the original named\nplaintiffs who brought this suit against the defendants herein\nand has been more active than any other plaintiff in pursuing\nthis case, having appeared before the court on several occasions\nas a witness and representative of the plaintiff class and also\nat conferences.”\n     Regarding the attorneys who negotiated the settlement\n\n                                   37\n\fAyers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Accordingly, because\n\nthe agreement provides ample relief to the class and Appellants\n\nhave not shown that any record evidence supports their\n\ninadequate-representation allegation, we refuse to invalidate the\n\nsettlement on this ground.\n\n     6.   Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Appellants also contend that the settlement should be\n\nrejected because the amount of attorneys’ fees was negotiated\n\nalong with the rest of the agreement.     But they fail to cite any\n\nauthority for the proposition that a district court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it approves a settlement agreement that contains\n\na provision for attorneys’ fees.     On the contrary, the Supreme\n\nCourt has stated that, “[i]deally, of course, litigants will\n\nsettle the amount of a fee.”   Hensley v.

True, the Court has suggested that, in cases where\n\nthe plaintiffs request damages and the defendant offers to settle\n\nfor a lump sum covering both damages and attorneys’ fees,\n\nnegotiating the allocation may present a conflict of interest for\n\nthe plaintiffs’ attorney.    But even in such cases, the Court has\n\ndeclined to prohibit simultaneous negotiation of liability and\n\nfees, stating that “a defendant may have good reason to demand to\n\nknow his total liability.”    White v.

The provision for attorneys’ fees\n\ntherefore does not cause us to conclude that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in approving the settlement agreement.\n\n     7.

Alternatively, they claim that Rule 23 cannot be\n\napplied to deny them the opportunity to litigate their claims in\n\na separate proceeding.   Appellants raise two arguments in support\n\nof this alterative contention.    First, they maintain that\n\nMississippi state law affords them the right to proceed with a\n\nseparate action30 and that Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1938), requires us to apply state law rather than Rule\n\n23.   Second, Appellants suggest that refusing to permit them to\n\nopt out impinges on their First Amendment rights.\n\n      We have held that “a member of a class certified under Rule\n\n23(b)(2) has no absolute right to opt out of the class.”      Penson,\n\n634 F.2d at 994.   Rather, a “district court . . . acting under\n\nits Rule 23(d)(2) discretionary power, may require that an opt-\n\nout right and notice thereof be given should it believe that such\n\n\n\n      30\n           See MISS. CONST. art. 3, § 24.\n\n                                  40\n\fa right is desirable to protect the interests of the absent class\n\nmembers.”   Id.   Typically, such cases involve “hybrid” Rule\n\n23(b)(2) class actions, in which individual monetary relief for\n\ncertain class members is sought in addition to class-wide\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief.     Id.   “Such a class action, at\n\nleast in the relief stage, begins to resemble a 23(b)(3) action,\n\nand there has been more concern with protecting the due process\n\nrights of the individual class members to ensure they are aware\n\nof the opportunity to receive the monetary relief to which they\n\nare entitled.”    Id.\n\n     Here, the class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because\n\nMississippi, in maintaining vestiges of its prior de jure system\n\nof higher education, had “acted [and] refused to act on grounds\n\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\n\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with\n\nrespect to the class as a whole.”     FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2).   This\n\ncase is not a hybrid class action; the Private Plaintiffs have\n\nsought solely injunctive and declaratory relief throughout the\n\nlitigation.   Even in their briefs to this court,\n\nAppellants——while expressing their dissatisfaction with the\n\nextent of the relief provided for in the settlement agreement——do\n\nnot request any individual relief, whether monetary or otherwise.\n\nAppellants’ interests do not diverge from those of the Private\n\nPlaintiffs who support the settlement, except to the extent that\n\n\n\n                                 41\n\fAppellants believe that they are entitled to greater class-wide\n\ninjunctive relief.   Accordingly, since Appellants have failed to\n\nshow the existence of individual claims that are separate and\n\ndistinct from the claims for class-wide relief, the district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that no basis existed for it to\n\nexercise its discretion to allow Appellants to opt out.\n\n     Additionally, we reject Appellants’ assertion that the\n\nrequisites of Rule 23(a) have not been met here.   As discussed\n\nabove, the district court confirmed class certification in its\n\nfinal judgment.   Aside from their allegation of inadequate\n\nrepresentation, Appellants do not specify why——after nearly\n\nthirty years of litigation——they now feel that class\n\ncertification was improper in this case.   Further, Appellants’\n\ninadequate-representation argument fails in this context for the\n\nsame reason that this contention did not cause us to reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s approval of the settlement: Appellants provide\n\nnothing to contradict the district court’s finding that class\n\ncounsel and Congressman Thompson adequately represented the\n\nPrivate-Plaintiff class.\n\n     Finally, Appellants’ contentions based on Erie and the First\n\nAmendment lack merit.   First, this is not a diversity case; thus,\n\nErie is inapplicable.   Erie, 304 U.S. at 78 (“Except in matters\n\ngoverned by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the\n\nlaw to be applied in any case is the law of the State.” (emphasis\n\n\n\n                                42\n\fadded)).    Moreover, Erie does not affect the application of a\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure, such as Rule 23, in federal\n\ncourt.    See Hanna v. Plumer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107024\"><a href=\"/opinion/107024/hanna-v-plumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (1965) (“The Erie\n\nrule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule.”).    Second,\n\nAppellants provide no authority for the proposition that denying\n\nthem the right to opt out of a Rule 23(b)(2) class violates the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n     Appellants fail to articulate a viable ground for opting out\n\nof the class.   Consequently, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion.\n\nC.   Attorneys’ Fees\n\n     Finally, Mr. Chambliss asserts that he is not bound by the\n\nprovision for attorneys’ fees in the settlement agreement.     He\n\ninsists that he is entitled to have his fee determined by the\n\ndistrict court.    Further, he claims that he should be compensated\n\nat the same level as the lawyers who represented Mississippi in\n\nits tobacco litigation.\n\n     Mr. Chambliss’s contention lacks merit.   First, to the\n\nextent that Mr. Chambliss challenges the distribution of the sum\n\nprovided in the settlement agreement for attorneys’ fees, there\n\nis no order for us to review because the district court has yet\n\nto rule on the allocation of the attorneys’-fees money.31\n\n\n     31\n          The district court directed the Private Plaintiffs’\nattorneys to agree on the allocation of the funds provided in the\nagreement for attorneys’ fees, or the court stated that it would\n\n                                 43\n\fSecond, if one reads Appellants’ brief as arguing that the\n\nsettlement agreement should not have been approved because the\n\nprovision for attorneys’ fees was improper, that contention is\n\nunavailing, as explained above.    Third, Mr. Chambliss provides no\n\nauthority for the proposition that he should be allowed to file a\n\nsubsequent claim for attorneys’ fees when the district court has\n\napproved a settlement that contains an agreement as to fees.    The\n\npreferred view seems to be that a claim for attorneys’ fees in a\n\ncivil-rights action, which is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b),\n\nis a single claim possessed by the client.     See Evans, 475 U.S.\n\nat 730 & n.19; Richards v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372811\"><a href=\"/opinion/372811/24-fair-emplpraccas-32-24-empl-prac-dec-p-31388-dianne-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 & n.2 (5th\n\nCir. 1980).   Here, the parties settled the class’s attorneys’-\n\nfees claim along with the rest of this case.    We therefore reject\n\nMr. Chambliss’s assertion that he is entitled to proceed\n\nseparately regarding attorneys’ fees.   Further, until the\n\ndistrict court approves an allocation of the funds provided in\n\nthe settlement agreement for attorneys’ fees, we cannot review\n\nwhether Mr. Chambliss has received an appropriate share.\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n\n\ndetermine the allocation. Class counsel has proposed a division\nof the funds, which was negotiated and agreed to by five of the\nsix lawyers and firms that have represented the Private-Plaintiff\nclass. Only Mr. Chambliss neither participated in the\ndiscussions nor approved class counsel’s proposal, even though he\nwas repeatedly invited to participate in the negotiations.\nNevertheless, the proposed division includes a significant share\nfor Mr. Chambliss. It does not appear from the record that the\ndistrict court has ruled on the proposed allocation.\n\n                                  44\n\fAccordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                          45\n\f</pre>",
