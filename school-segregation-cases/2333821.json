Mason (\"Plaintiff\") has brought a suit against the DEP and various individuals who are or were employed by the DEP (\"the Individual Defendants\"). Plaintiff's <i>Complaint</i> alleges, among other counts, that the DEP and the Individual Defendants violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\").<sup>[1]</sup> Presently at issue is the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [#4] and the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [# 8]. For the following reasons, the DEP's <i>Motion</i> is ALLOWED and the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion</i> is ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Background</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Factual Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>From November 5, 1995 to January 31, 2008, Plaintiff was an employee of the DEP.<sup>[3]</sup> While employed at the DEP, Plaintiff suffered from asthma, hearing problems, diverticulitis, stress/hypertension, and anxiety.<sup>[4]</sup> These conditions interfere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> with Plaintiff's major life functions of sleeping, concentrating, interacting with others, learning, and working.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, Plaintiff was diagnosed with chronic depression in 2003 and with \"high blood pressure/hypertension\" in 2005.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2007, the DEP increased Plaintiff's workload, responsibilities, and duties, thereby exacerbating Plaintiff's condition.<sup>[7]</sup> Around August of 2007, Plaintiff informed Defendant d'Hedouville and \"DEP Management\" of his specific medical impairments, that the increased responsibility at work was exacerbating his condition, and that his impairment was interfering with his ability to work.<sup>[8]</sup> Plaintiff sought treatment for these conditions in September and October of 2007.<sup>[9]</sup> In particular, he was hospitalized on October 3, 2007 and October 6, 2007.<sup>[10]</sup> The DEP knew or should have known about Plaintiff's hospitalization.<sup>[11]</sup> Plaintiff used his accrued sick and vacation time when absent from work.<sup>[12]</sup> Despite Plaintiff's hospitalization and reporting of his medical impairments, Defendant d'Hedouville did not inform Plaintiff of his rights under the FMLA.<sup>[13]</sup> The DEP allegedly subjected Plaintiff to additional adverse employment actions, such as issuing Plaintiff a written warning on November 16, 2007 allegedly because of Plaintiff's impairments.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 17, 2007, the DEP convened a meeting about Plaintiff's work performance, at which Plaintiff alleges that he was denied his <i>Weingarten</i> rights.<sup>[15]</sup> On November 28, 2007, based upon information gathered at the November 17 meeting, the DEP suspended Plaintiff for five business days for lack of veracity, poor work performance, and insubordination.<sup>[16]</sup> While serving his suspension, on November 29, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a medical note from a nurse practitioner indicating that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, dehydration, diarrhea, and significant weight loss.<sup>[17]</sup> On December 2, 2007, Plaintiff requested information regarding his FMLA rights from Defendant d'Hedouville and he forwarded the request to Defendants Massimo and Stolfa.<sup>[18]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> DEP, in particular Defendant Massimo, denied Plaintiff leave under the FMLA.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>On December 5, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a letter to Defendant Massimo.<sup>[20]</sup> The letter included a medical note informing the DEP that Plaintiff needed to take a leave of absence to treat his disabilities rather than return from his suspension.<sup>[21]</sup> Plaintiff also provided, on December 6, 2007, a \"Certification of Health Care Provider\" (\"Certification\") executed by his Nurse Practitioner \"Smith\" (\"NP Smith\"), mentioning Plaintiff's inability to work \"relative to\" Plaintiff's \"serious health condition.\"<sup>[22]</sup> On December 11, 2007, Defendant Massimo requested details about Plaintiff's ailment and noted that the Certification was not signed by a medical doctor.<sup>[23]</sup> On December 12, 2007, NP Smith notified the DEP that Plaintiff was diagnosed with high blood pressure, gastroenteritis, and sleep deprivation.<sup>[24]</sup> NP Smith also later notified the DEP that the stress level caused by the denial of FMLA leave would worsen Plaintiff's condition.<sup>[25]</sup> After multiple communications regarding the documentation for Plaintiff's requested leave, the DEP denied Plaintiff's request on December 23, 2007, because his request was not signed by a medical doctor, it failed to discuss the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition, and it failed to include the reasons why the medical leave was necessary.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>The DEP arranged an appointment for Plaintiff to obtain a second medical opinion with Dr. Morris,<sup>[27]</sup> at which the doctor stated to Plaintiff, \"I understand that you have been disciplined twice.\"<sup>[28]</sup> At the appointment, Plaintiff refused to sign a medical release.<sup>[29]</sup> Despite this fact, Dr. Morris provided his medical notes to the DEP.<sup>[30]</sup> On January 23, 2008, the DEP conducted a Pre-Termination hearing, at which Defendant Massimo was the Hearing Officer.<sup>[31]</sup> In response to Plaintiff's complaint of Defendant Massimo's bias (given his involvement in Plaintiff's FMLA denial), \"upper level management\" at the DEP refused to provide Plaintiff with an appeal.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p>On January 31, 2008, despite the Certification executed by NP Smith and that Plaintiff's impairments met the criteria for \"serious health condition[s]\" under the FMLA, Plaintiff was terminated based (at least partly) on Dr. Morris's second medical opinion.<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> B. <i>Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff filed a <i>Complaint</i> on December 4, 2009, naming the DEP along with the Individual Defendants.<sup>[34]</sup> The <i>Complaint</i> contained seven counts: (I) violation of Plaintiff's FMLA rights (namely, a violation of the personal medical leave provision by denying Plaintiff leave for a \"serious health condition\"); (II) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (III) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (IV) interference with advantageous business relations (only as to the Individual Defendants); (V) retaliation and inference with protected rights; (VI) invasion of privacy under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 214, section 1B (only as to the DEP and Defendant Massimo); and (VII) conversion (only as to the DEP).<sup>[35]</sup> Plaintiff sought punitive damages.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants and the DEP have filed separate <i>Motions to Dismiss.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must include factual allegations that, if taken as true, demonstrate a plausible claim for relief.<sup>[37]</sup> This court addresses the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> and the Individual Defendant's <i>Motion to Dismiss,</i> in that order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The DEP's Motion to Dismiss</i><sup>[38]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Count I Is Barred Against the DEP by the Eleventh Amendment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment prevents private individuals from suing non-consenting states in federal court.<sup>[39]</sup> This immunity also applies to \"arms\" of the state.<sup>[40]</sup> Although Congress has the power to abrogate that Eleventh Amendment immunity, such power may only be validly exercised if Congress both (a) \"`unequivocally intends to do so'\" and (b) \"`act(s) pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority,'\" such as the authority granted by Section 5 of the Fourteen Amendment.<sup>[41]</sup></p>\n<p>The FMLA entitles eligible employees to a certain amount of unpaid leave per year in four clearly specified situations: (1) the birth of a child; (2) the adoption of a child or placement of a foster child; (3) the need to care for a parent, child or spouse with a serious health condition (the \"family-care\" leave provision); and (4) the inability to work due to the employee's own serious health condition (the \"self-care\" or \"personal medical\" leave provision).<sup>[42]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> Only the personal medical leave provision is at issue here.<sup>[43]</sup></p>\n<p>The First Circuit held, in <i>Laro v. New Hampshire,</i><sup>[44]</sup> that \"the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA does not exhibit a sufficient congruence to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination to validly abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"<sup>[45]</sup> As a result, no private action for monetary damages may lie against state employers for violation of the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Two years after <i>Laro,</i> the Supreme Court held that Congress validly abrogated sovereign immunity such that state employees may maintain claims in federal court for their employers' failure to comply with the family-care provision of the FMLA.<sup>[46]</sup> The Court, however, did not address whether sovereign immunity is similarly abrogated for claims of a violation of the personal medical leave provision.<sup>[47]</sup> The prevailing law in the First Circuit, therefore, is that the Commonwealth retains Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims under the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.<sup>[48]</sup></p>\n<p>Because (1) the DEP is an agency of the Commonwealth<sup>[49]</sup> and (2) Plaintiff's FMLA claim against the DEP is based solely upon Plaintiff's exercise of the personal medical leave provision, Count I is barred as against the DEP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Count V Against the DEP, Alleging Retaliation, Fails to State a Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In Count V, Plaintiff alleges \"retaliation and interference with protected rights.\"<sup>[50]</sup> Construing the language of Count V in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he appears to raise two potential bases for his allegation of retaliation: (a) the exercise of his <i>Weingarten</i> rights and (b) the exercise of his FMLA rights.<sup>[51]</sup> Neither is a sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> basis to allow Plaintiff's claim to survive.</p>\n<p>Under the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), an employee under a union contract whose employer is subject to the NLRA has <i>Weingarten</i> rights: the employee is entitled to union representation at any meeting at which the employee reasonably believes that he or she will be disciplined.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\n<p>The DEP highlights that any <i>Weingarten</i> rights that Plaintiff might have would arise from his status as a union employee under his union's collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with the DEP, rather than an independent employment contract with the DEP.<sup>[53]</sup> The DEP also points out that only Plaintiff's union may enforce those rights by asserting and exhausting the applicable grievance procedures in the CBA.<sup>[54]</sup> Moreover, the applicable grievance procedures must be exhausted before relief is sought in court.<sup>[55]</sup> Plaintiff does not dispute any of these contentions.</p>\n<p>Given the above understanding, Plaintiff has failed to identify any legal grounds for a retaliation claim on the basis of <i>Weingarten</i> rights. Plaintiff has not shown that he is the type of an employee entitled to <i>Weingarten</i> rights. Moreover, Plaintiff has not shown that his union either asserted Plaintiff's rights or exhausted any applicable grievance procedures. Plaintiff therefore does not have a private right of action to enforce <i>Weingarten</i> rights.<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>Insofar as Plaintiff claims retaliation based upon his exercise of his FMLA rights under the personal medical leave provision,<sup>[57]</sup> his claim is also barred by the Eleventh Amendment. If Congress cannot validly abrogate sovereign immunity for claims based on the personal medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*356</span> leave provision of the FMLA because such claims are not related to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination, it must follow that Congress is similarly unable to abrogate sovereign immunity for retaliation claims based upon that same personal medical leave provision.<sup>[58]</sup> Plaintiff does not dispute this argument. Under any reading of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, therefore, Count V fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Plaintiff's State Law Claims Against the DEP Are Barred</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Eleventh Amendment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>All of Plaintiff's state law claims (Counts II, III, VI, and VII) against the DEP, a state agency, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment precludes suits in federal court against non-consenting states, state agencies, and state officials sued in their official capacities.<sup>[59]</sup> The bar applies \"regardless of whether the suit seeks damages or injunctive relief.\"<sup>[60]</sup> All of Plaintiff's state law claims are therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act Bars Counts II, III, VI, and VII Against the DEP</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff's state law claims are also barred for other reasons. Counts II, VI, and VII state intentional torts: intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and conversion, respectively.<sup>[61]</sup> All three claims are barred against the DEP by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (\"MTCA\") because Section 10(c) of Chapter 258 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides that the Commonwealth cannot be held liable for any claim arising out of an intentional tort.<sup>[62]</sup> Accordingly, Counts II, VI, and VII fail as against the DEP and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Count III alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress against the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*357</span> DEP.<sup>[63]</sup> The MTCA, in providing a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims, outlines careful parameters for the Commonwealth's liability. In particular, the law provides that a \"civil action shall not be instituted against a public employer on a claim for damages under this chapter unless the claimant shall have first presented his claim in writing to the executive officer of such public employer within two years after the date upon which the cause of action arose.\"<sup>[64]</sup> Section Four's specification of presentment is a \"statutory prerequisite; compliance is a condition precedent to the assertion of a right created by the act.\"<sup>[65]</sup> A plaintiff's failure to present her claim in accordance with Section Four precludes bringing a claim for injuries under the MTCA.<sup>[66]</sup> Here, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the MTCA's presentment requirement was met. Plaintiff does not allege that he presented his claim. Neither the Attorney General's office nor the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs have any record of Plaintiff having presented his claim.<sup>[67]</sup> As a result, Count III is barred as against the DEP and is dismissed.<sup>[68]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants claim that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim on either of his federal counts: Count I, alleging a violation of the FMLA's personal medical leave provision; and Count V, alleging retaliation against Plaintiff for attempting to exercise his FMLA rights. The Individual Defendants argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit against them in their official capacities and that under the FMLA they are not liable in their individual capacities. The Individual Defendants additionally argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity. This court considers the Individual Defendants' arguments in seriatim.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Eleventh Amendment Immunity for Official Capacity Suits</i><sup>[69]</sup></p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants contend that state officials sued in their official capacities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*358</span> are entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.<sup>[70]</sup></p>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment has been construed by the Supreme Court to bar an action for damages against a state official because it is a suit against the official's office and \"`no different from a suit against the State itself.'\"<sup>[71]</sup> Congress can, however, abrogate states' and state officials' Eleventh Amendment immunity if Congress both (a) makes its intention \"unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" and (b) acts pursuant to a \"valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<sup>[72]</sup> Congress has satisfied the first of these two criteria by providing that employees may seek damages under the FMLA \"against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.\"<sup>[73]</sup> The First Circuit has held that Congress has failed to satisfy the second criterion, at least with reference to the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA that Plaintiff invokes.<sup>[74]</sup></p>\n<p>The First Circuit has held that the FMLA's personal medical leave provision \"does not exhibit a sufficient congruence to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination to validly abrogate\" the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the \"states as employers from private damages actions.\"<sup>[75]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiff's arguments referencing Judge Lipez's dissent in <i>Laro</i> are unavailing.<sup>[76]</sup> It is true that the Supreme Court determined in <i>Hibbs</i> that the family-care leave provision of the FMLA represents a valid abrogation of states' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[77]</sup> But the First Circuit's holding in <i>Laro</i>that the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity has not been validly abrogated by Congress's enactment of the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA<sup>[78]</sup>remains binding here.<sup>[79]</sup> The holding in <i>Laro</i> has \"not been modified by, let alone presented to, the First Circuit since the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> Court's decision in <i>Hibbs.</i>\"<sup>[80]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, insofar as Plaintiff brings this claim against the Individual Defendants in their official capacities, this claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Additionally, insofar as Plaintiff claims retaliation based upon the exercise of his FMLA rights under the personal medical leave provision,<sup>[81]</sup> this claim against the Individual Defendants in their official capacities is also barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<sup>[82]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>State Officials May Be Liable in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants argue that if they have been sued in their individual capacities, then they are still not liable under the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.<sup>[83]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Plaintiff Has Sued the Individual Defendants in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, the Individuals Defendants argue that Plaintiff's failure to indicate that the suit is against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities means that this court should presume that the suit is an official-capacity suit.<sup>[84]</sup> Contrary to the Individual Defendants' assertion,<sup>[85]</sup> the First Circuit has addressed the issue and has adopted a \"course of proceedings\" test.<sup>[86]</sup> Under this test, the court examines the \"substance of the pleadings and the course of proceedings in order to determine whether the suit is for individual or official liability.\"<sup>[87]</sup> The underlying inquiry is whether a plaintiff's \"intention to hold a defendant personally liable can be ascertained fairly.\"<sup>[88]</sup> Relevant factors include the nature of a plaintiff's claims, requests for compensatory or punitive damages, and the nature of any defenses raised in response to the complaint.<sup>[89]</sup></p>\n<p>Much like in <i>Powell,</i> the course of proceedings here gave the Individual Defendants fair notice that they were being sued in their individual capacities. First, Plaintiff's <i>Complaint</i> contained a prayer for punitive damages.<sup>[90]</sup> Although many courts have held that punitive damages cannot be recovered in an FMLA action,<sup>[91]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*360</span> at the least the mention of punitive damages would likely charge the Individual Defendants with notice of an individual-capacity suit. Second, the Individual Defendants raised a qualified immunity defense,<sup>[92]</sup> which indicates that the Individual Defendants interpreted Plaintiff's action as being against them personally.<sup>[93]</sup> Moreover, Plaintiffs's counsel even confirmed at a February 17, 2011 Motion Hearing in front of this court that Plaintiff was suing the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities, not in their official capacities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>The Relevant FMLA Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The next issue is whether the Individual Defendants, who are employees and supervisors for a public agency, are individually liable for violations of the FMLA.<sup>[94]</sup> The Individual Defendants argue that the FMLA's language only applies to employers and that they are not liable because they are not employers under the FMLA.<sup>[95]</sup></p>\n<p>Resolution of this legal question depends on the FMLA's definition of \"employer,\" which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>(4) Employer. (A) In general. The term \"employer\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) means any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) includes</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(I) any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(II) any successor in interest of an employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iii) includes any \"public agency\", as defined in section 3(x) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(x)); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iv) includes the General Accounting Office [Government Accountability Office] and the Library of Congress.<sup>[96]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Because the individual liability provision (clause (ii)(I)) is separate from the provision which includes public agencies (clause (iv)), it is sharply contested whether the FMLA's definition of \"employer\" applies to supervisors of public agencies.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court and the First Circuit have yet to directly address this issue.<sup>[97]</sup> District courts within the First Circuit have differed in their outcomes.<sup>[98]</sup> But <span class=\"star-pagination\">*361</span> the decisions of the other courts within the First Circuit are not entirely on point for the purposes of this decision. The rationale for those cases is slightly removed from the debate here concerning whether the FMLA attaches individual liability to public employees.<sup>[99]</sup></p>\n<p>In the decisions that directly address the matter, there is a nationwide split among both Courts of Appeals and district courts.<sup>[100]</sup> On the one hand, the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that public employees cannot be held individually liable under the FMLA.<sup>[101]</sup> In holding that the FMLA's individual liability provision \"does not extend to public agencies,\"<sup>[102]</sup> the Sixth Circuit in <i>Mitchell</i> provided three detailed textual reasons for its holding.<sup>[103]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits have taken the opposite position and concluded that public employees may be held individually liable under the FMLA.<sup>[104]</sup> This was the majority position, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*362</span> at least as of 2006.<sup>[105]</sup> This court will accordingly refer to the Fifth and Eighth Circuits' view as the majority position.<sup>[106]</sup> The Fifth and Eighth Circuits interpreted the text of the FMLA as permitting a public employee to be individually liable if the public employee violated the FMLA and \"act[ed], directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer.\"<sup>[107]</sup> The Fifth Circuit in <i>Modica</i> also sequentially rejected the three reasons relied upon by the Sixth Circuit in <i>Mitchell.</i><sup>[108]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>The Individual Defendants May Be Liable in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As the First Circuit has instructed in considering the FMLA, this court's analysis begins \"with the language of the statute and ask `whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.'\"<sup>[109]</sup> If Congress's intent is clear, \"that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\"<sup>[110]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*363</span> Based on a fair reading of the FMLA's text, this court concludes that the majority position is more convincing. According to Section 2611(4)(A), the term \"employer\" includes public agencies. The term \"employer\" also includes any person who acts \"directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such an employer.\" It follows that an individual acting in the interest of a public agency can be an \"employer.\" The Individual Defendants, therefore, as supervisors in a public agency, may be subject to individual liability under the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Because the Individual Defendants' arguments originate from <i>Mitchell,</i><sup>[111]</sup> this court will explain why the <i>Mitchell</i> court's analysis in less persuasive than the majority position.</p>\n<p>The <i>Mitchell</i> court first focused on the separation of the individual liability provision and public agency provision into two clauses, arguing that there is no relationship between clauses (ii)-(iv).<sup>[112]</sup> The court reasoned that \"the separation of otherwise related concepts (i.e., what the term `employer' `includes') into distinctly enumerated clauses compels an interpretation that treats each clause in an independent manner.\"<sup>[113]</sup> There is, however, no compelling logic for such a conclusion. If the provisions were not distinctly enumerated, but grouped together, it could be just as arguable whether \"employer\" includes \"any person who acts . . . in the interest of an employer\" that is a \"public agency.\"<sup>[114]</sup> And as other courts have pointed out, two grammatical items(1) the word \"and\" that follows clause (iii) and (2) the em dash (\"\") that follows the term \"employer\" (at the top of the definition)suggest a relationship between the individual liability and public agency provisions.<sup>[115]</sup> Moreover, although the relevant Senate committee report is not dispositive of the issue, it does slightly weigh in favor of this court's reading.<sup>[116]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*364</span> The <i>Mitchell</i> court next argued that having clauses (i)-(iv) included in the term \"employer\" would yield an interpretation that \"renders other provisions of the statute superfluous\" and create \"several oddities.\"<sup>[117]</sup> Each oddity or apparent superfluous aspect has been convincingly refuted by other courts. First, Section 2611(4)(B), providing that a public agency is considered a \"person engaged in commerce or in an industry or activity affecting commerce,\" is not rendered superfluous because its purpose is to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving that a public agency is engaged in commerce.<sup>[118]</sup> Second, an interpretation that holds supervisors of public agencies individually liable is not redundant, particularly given that holding a supervisor in the private sector liable yields an identical result.<sup>[119]</sup> Third, this court's interpretation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*365</span> does not create an \"absurdity\" through the successor-in-interest clause ((ii)(II)) applying to the Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") and Library of Congress (clause iv).<sup>[120]</sup> Clause (iv) was only included by a 1995 amendment<sup>[121]</sup> and this unanticipated effect on the 1993 law should not change the \"straightforward language of the clauses\" with which this court is here concerned.<sup>[122]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court lastly argued that a definition of \"employer\" that \"incorporates the individual liability and public agency provision[s] into a single clause is substantially similar to, if not identical,\"<sup>[123]</sup> to definition of employer in the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\").<sup>[124]</sup> Had Congress intended the FMLA and FLSA's definitions of \"employer\" to be identical, the <i>Mitchell</i> court argued, it would have expressly adopted the FLSA's definition.<sup>[125]</sup> This argument is unconvincing for four reasons, three of which have been succinctly expressed by another court:</p>\n<blockquote>[1][I]t would have been curious for the FMLA to have incorporated the FLSA's definition of \"employer,\" as that definition makes explicit reference to \"labor organizations.\" Such a reference in the context of the Family and Medical Leave Act would have been unnecessary and a likely cause of confusion. [2] In any event, though the FMLA does adopt several of the FSLA's [sic] provisions by direct reference, in other instances it does not. <i>Compare</i> 29 U.S.C. § 2611(1) (defining \"commerce\"), with 29 U.S.C. § 203(b) (same). . . . [3][I]f Congress wanted to shield public officials from liability under the FMLA, it would have done so explicitly; indeed, Congress did so in the FLSA when it excluded from the definition of \"employer\" \"any labor organization (other than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.\" Congress could have as easily included a provision in Section 2611(4) limiting the liability of public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*366</span> agencies to the agencies themselves. Congress chose not to do so, and this Court is not prepared to read into the statute that effect.<sup>[126]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth, various courts have concluded that the FMLA's definition of \"employer\" is virtually identical to the FLSA's definition of \"employer,\" and the term \"employer\" should be interpreted the same way under both statutes.<sup>[127]</sup></p>\n<p>Although this court's reasoning does not rely solely on the analogy between the FMLA and FLSA,<sup>[128]</sup> the First Circuit may find otherwise.<sup>[129]</sup> Accordingly, the First Circuit's relevant FLSA decisions indicate that the Individual Defendants may still be held individually liable. Specifically, the First Circuit interprets the FLSA's definition of \"employer\" pursuant to an \"economic reality\" analysis.<sup>[130]</sup> The First Circuit has determined that several factors are important to the personal liability analysis, including the individual's ownership interest, degree of control over the corporation's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*367</span> financial affairs and compensation practices, and role in \"caus[ing] the corporation to compensate (or not to compensate) employees in accordance with the FLSA.\"<sup>[131]</sup> With this test and factors in mind, the First Circuit has affirmed a president of a corporation being held liable because he did not just have \"some supervisory control over other employees\" but had \"ultimate control over the business's day-to-day operations.\"<sup>[132]</sup> Moreover, he was \"instrumental\" in \"causing\" the corporation to violate the FLSA because he was the \"corporate officer principally in charge of directing employment practices, such as hiring and firing employees, requiring employees to attend meetings unpaid, and setting employees' wages and schedules.\"<sup>[133]</sup> The First Circuit's \"economic reality\" has been applied in the FMLA context by district courts in the First Circuit, albeit in the context of a supervisor working for a private company.<sup>[134]</sup></p>\n<p>Were the First Circuit to apply this test to the context of a supervisor of a \"public agency,\"<sup>[135]</sup> the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion</i> would likely still be denied. All of the Individual Defendants are alleged to have been instrumental in causing the violation of Plaintiff's FMLA rights.<sup>[136]</sup> Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*368</span> Massimo and d'Hedouville were allegedly particularly instrumental in some violations.<sup>[137]</sup> Defendant Massimo not only allegedly denied Plaintiff leave under the FMLA,<sup>[138]</sup> but also violated Plaintiff's FMLA rights in other ways.<sup>[139]</sup> Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant d'Hedouville of Plaintiff's personal medical conditions<sup>[140]</sup> and Defendant d'Hedouville did not inform Plaintiff of his FMLA rights.<sup>[141]</sup> Although Defendants Burt, McGillicuddy, and Stolfa were not as often involved with Plaintiff, they nonetheless appear to be responsible for making decisions that contributed to the alleged violations.<sup>[142]</sup> These three Defendants also appear to have exercised a sufficient level of control, at least in regards to the power to hire and fire employees.<sup>[143]</sup> Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that all of the Individual Defendants retaliated against him by terminating him for requesting FMLA leave.<sup>[144]</sup> Plaintiff has therefore adequately pled that the Individual Defendants were instrumental in causing the violation of his FMLA rights.<sup>[145]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> On a separate note, the Individual Defendants argue that Congress did not intend to hold individuals working for public agencies liable because it would be a disincentive to enter public service.<sup>[146]</sup> This argument is not persuasive for several reasons. First, this court's conclusion is rooted in the plain meaning of the statute and it need not venture into extensive speculations concerning congressional intent and purpose behind the FMLA.<sup>[147]</sup> Second, the Individual Defendants cite authoritycase law, congressional history, or otherto support their argument. Third, insofar as this is an invocation of the \"dog that did not bark\" canon,<sup>[148]</sup> the canon does not apply because there is no indication that a potential disincentive to enter public service \"would be so extreme as to have inevitably provoked comment in Congress.\"<sup>[149]</sup></p>\n<p>This court's conclusion is based on the FMLA's clear text. Recognizing, however, that another court might hold that the FMLA is ambiguous,<sup>[150]</sup> this court notes that the Department of Labor's (\"DOL\") interpretations could support the view that supervisors in public agencies are individually liable.<sup>[151]</sup> The <i>Modica</i> and <i>Mitchell</i> courts cited to the same provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations defining \"employer\" and both courts claimed that those provisions supported their contrary conclusions.<sup>[152]</sup> Whereas the <i>Modica</i> court found <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> that the definition of \"employer\" under the FMLA was \"virtually the same\" as the definition in the FLSA (but for the inclusion of successors in interest and exclusion of labor organizations),<sup>[153]</sup> the <i>Mitchell</i> court thought the separation between \"public agency\" and \"directly or indirectly\" in one definition supported its interpretation.<sup>[154]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court also highlighted the mention of \"corporate officers\" in another definition.<sup>[155]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court's view of the agency's final rule is not convincing for two reasons. First, no logic compels the <i>Mitchell</i> court's interpretation of the regulations. The clause \"directly or indirectly\" can still coherently relate to the \"public agency\" clause such that a supervisor within a public agency may be an \"employer.\" Second, the regulatory preamble (or \"Summary of Major Comments\") explaining the regulation at issuethe definition of \"employer\"suggests that the DOL agrees with this court's conclusion.<sup>[156]</sup> Specifically, a public agency with jurisdiction over public (and private) entities questioned \"whether managers or supervisors can be held personally liable\" under the FMLA.<sup>[157]</sup> In response to this question from a public agency, the DOL clarified that not only \"corporate officers\" but \"managers and supervisors\" can also be held individually liable.<sup>[158]</sup> The DOL's interpretations, therefore, reinforce this court's conclusion, which is rooted in the statutory text, that supervisors in public agencies may be held individually liable for violations of the FMLA.<sup>[159]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> 3. <i>The Individual Defendants Are Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants argue that even if they fall within the definition of an \"employer\" under the FMLA and are subject to individual liability, they are entitled to qualified immunity because their liability had not been \"clearly established.\"<sup>[160]</sup> The Individual Defendants provide no First Circuit case law to support the application of qualified immunity here.<sup>[161]</sup> The Individual Defendants argue solely that they should receive qualified immunity because of legal uncertainty over the individual liability of public officials.<sup>[162]</sup> This argument misconstrues the First Circuit's method of analyzing a qualified immunity claim. A claim of qualified immunity concerns the Individual Defendants' underlying <i>conduct</i> that gives rise to liability, not their prospective <i>liability</i> for violating a statute.<sup>[163]</sup> Any doubt as to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> Individual Defendants' liability is irrelevant because Plaintiff, as an employee of a public agency, had clearly established rights under the FMLA.<sup>[164]</sup> This court therefore focuses its argument below on the proper qualified immunity analysis.<sup>[165]</sup></p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has reaffirmed, the doctrine of qualified immunity \"protects government officials `from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\"<sup>[166]</sup> To determine whether a particular officer is entitled to qualified immunity, a \"court must decide: (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the Plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional [or statutory] right; and (2) if so, whether the right was `clearly established at the time of the defendant's alleged violation.'\"<sup>[167]</sup> The First Circuit has explained that the second step of the qualified immunity analysis has two aspects: \"(1) `the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation' and (2) whether, on the facts of the case, a `reasonable defendant would have understood that this conduct violated the Plaintiff's constitutional [or statutory] rights.'\"<sup>[168]</sup> A defendant, therefore, is entitled to qualified immunity if a \"reasonable official would not have understood\" that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> her conduct violated a plaintiff's constitutional or statutory rights.<sup>[169]</sup> This prong of the inquiry is highly fact-specific.<sup>[170]</sup> In conducting this analysis, \"a court should `use its full knowledge of its own [and other relevant] precedents.'\"<sup>[171]</sup> Under the above analysis, both of the prongs of the qualified immunity analysis have been met.<sup>[172]</sup> First, Plaintiff has alleged conduct that constitutes a violation of the FMLA. The Individual Defendants allegedly failed to comply with statutory procedures. For instance, the Individual Defendants allegedly failed to provide Plaintiff with a third health care provider to give a binding final opinion to resolve the conflict between certifying doctors.<sup>[173]</sup> Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave was denied.<sup>[174]</sup> Plaintiff has alleged interference with his FMLA rights<sup>[175]</sup> and retaliation for his exercise of those rights.<sup>[176]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, between late 2007 and early 2008,<sup>[177]</sup> this conduct was clearly established as a violation of the FMLA. Applying the two subsidiary issues on the second prong, this court first determines that the law was clear in general that it was a violation of the FMLA for the Individual Defendants to engage in the conduct at issue. These violated rights include<sup>[178]</sup> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> following: (a) the employers' interference with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by failing to provide FMLA leave and not discharging their obligations to inquire; and (b) terminating Plaintiff in retaliation for his requesting FMLA leave.<sup>[179]</sup> Failing to provide Plaintiff's requested leave could be a violation of the FMLA.<sup>[180]</sup> The Individual Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff individualized notice of the FMLA would also be a violation, at least if it harmed or prejudiced Plaintiff.<sup>[181]</sup> The Individual Defendants' alleged acts of retaliation (e.g., termination) were clearly established as violations of the FMLA.<sup>[182]</sup> Moreover, existing case law gave the Individual Defendants notice that it was potentially a violation of the FMLA to not allow for a third health care provider to resolve the conflict between certifying doctors.<sup>[183]</sup> Other courts, including controlling authority in at least one instance,<sup>[184]</sup> have noted that similar conduct constituted violations of the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Not only was the law generally clear that the Individual Defendants' conduct violated Plaintiff's FMLA rights, but, turning to the second subsidiary issue, on the facts of the case, a reasonable, defendant would have understood that this conduct violated the Plaintiff's FMLA rights. An objectively reasonable defendant would have understood that not providing notice to Plaintiff of his FMLA rights, denying Plaintiff his request for FMLA leave, failing to pursue its obligation to inquire, and retaliating against Plaintiff for exercise of his rights could violate Plaintiff's rights under the FMLA. Other courts have even found that such rights under the FMLA are clearly established.<sup>[185]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> As explained above, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show that the Individual Defendants' conduct violated his FMLA rights. The law at the time was clearly established to put the Individual Defendants on notice that their conduct violated the FMLA. Lastly, a reasonable defendant under the same circumstances as the Individual Defendants would have understood that the conduct at issue violated Plaintiff's statutory rights. The Individual Defendants are therefore not entitled to a defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, including Eleventh Amendment immunity, Plaintiff's failure to state a claim, and MTCA requirements, the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [# 8] is ALLOWED.</p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants are immune from this suit in their official capacities.

The Eleventh Circuit's decision in <i>Wascura</i> has held less persuasive force because \"the court concluded that the FMLA should be interpreted in the same manner as the FLSA, and therefore was bound by a previous holding of that circuit that a `public official sued in his individual capacity is not an employer subject to individual liability under the FLSA.'\" <i>Sadowski,</i> 643 F.Supp.2d at 753 n. 3 (quoting <i>Wascura,</i> 169 F.3d at 686). The <i>Wascura</i> court therefore did not engage in a textual analysis of the FMLA. <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 828. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit case holding that a public officer cannot be an employer in his individual capacity (because he only has the authority to act in his official capacity) has \"been swept away by the Supreme Court in\" <i>Hafer v.

Second, an interpretation that commingles the individual liability provision with the public agency provision renders certain provisions of the statute superfluous and results in several oddities.

In sum, and disregarding those courts bound by their Circuit's binding precedent, since 2006, six courts have decided to follow the majority position, whereas three courts have followed the minority position. <i>See</i> Leila Early, <i>Sadowski v.

That is, if clauses (ii)(I), (ii)(II), (iii), and (iv) were one long clause, one could still draw the same conclusion that the <i>Mitchell</i> court drew.</p>\n<p>[115]  <i>See </i><i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 185 (\"Congress's use of the em dash following the term `employer' indicates a relationship between clauses such that `employer means what is provided for in subparagraph (i) and includes what is provided for in subparagraphs (ii), (iii), and (iv).'\" (quoting <i>Sheaffer v. Cnty. of Chatham,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d 709, 728 (M.D.N.C.2004))). Another court has argued that had Congress intended for clause (4)(A)(ii) to modify the clauses (4)(A)(iii) and (iv), it \"surely would have made this intent crystal clear by placing subsection 4(A)(ii) last in the statute.\" <i>Keene,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d at 776, 779 (holding that supervisors of public agencies are not liable under the FMLA). But, insofar as the <i>Keene</i> court relied on various other (textual and non-textual) arguments, placing clause 4(A)(ii) last in the statute would not be any more of a \"crystal clear\" indication that it modified clause 4(A)(iii) and (iv).</p>\n<p>[116]  The report indicates that the majority viewed \"employer\" as being equally defined by public agencies and private employers. <i>See</i> S. Comm. on Labor and Human Res., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, S. Rep. 103-3, 21-22 (1993), <i>reprinted in</i> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 23-24, 1993 WL 22195, at *19 (\"Section 101(4)(A) defines an \"employer\" as any public agency as defined in section 3(x) of the FLSA, and any person engaged in commerce or in an industry or activity affecting commerce who employs 50 or more employees. . . .\"). Insofar as the definition of \"employer\" places public agencies and private employers on an equal plane, there is no clear reason why clause (ii)(I) would not apply to public agencies. Also, this court's consideration of legislative history, even where the statutory text is clear by its plain meaning, is in accord with the interpretive methods of the First Circuit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Larios,</i> 593 F.3d 82, 90 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Mass. Museum of Contemporary Art Found., Inc. v. Buchel,</i> 593 F.3d 38, 51 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Gen. Dynamics Land Sys. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004) (using legislative history to confirm plain meaning of language used in initial step of <i>Chevron</i> analysis). <i>But see </i><i>Saysana v. Gillen,</i> 590 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir.2009) (\"We approach all arguments based on legislative history with significant caution. . . . [A] speculative argument based on legislative history pales in the face of a very strong argument based on text and structure.\"); <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 48 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1995) (assuming without deciding that, during the initial stage of a <i>Chevron</i> inquiry, if a text's meaning is not readily apparent, a court may skeptically look into legislative history for an unmistakable expression of congressional intent).</p>\n<p>[117]  <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 830.</p>\n<p>[118]  <i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 186; <i>see </i><i>Hewett,</i> 421 F.Supp.2d at 820 (\"Section 2611(4)(b) <i>expressly</i> waives the requirement that plaintiffs prove that a public agency defendant is `engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce. . . .' It is difficult to envision that Congress would have at the same time <i>implicitly</i> barred suits against individual within those same agencies.\"). The <i>Mitchell</i> court also argued that clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) could not be read together because public agencies do not have to meet the fifty employee requirement to be considered an employer under the FMLA. <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 831 (\"`Public agencies are covered employers without regard to the number of employees employed.'\" (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.104(a))). This argument, for two reasons, does not prove that supervisors in public agencies cannot be held individually liable. First, there is no reason in the structure or grammar of the statute that clause (ii)(I) should only modify clause (i) and not modify clause (iii). The non-relation of clause (iii) to clause (i) does not require clause (ii)(I) to apply only to clause (i) and not to clause (iii). In fact, this reading of the text, that clause (ii)(I) applies to both clauses (iii) and (i), is supported by the views of the relevant Senate committee in the legislative history. <i>See supra</i> note 116 and accompanying text. Second, clause (iii) was likely separated from clause (i) for a different reason. Clause (i) includes as employers only those who employ \"50 or more employees.\" Congress was expressly and repeatedly concerned about the FMLA's impact (or lack thereof) on small businesses. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.

Also, it is logically consistent to maintain this court's conclusion concerning public supervisors' liability and separately read the successor-in-interest clause as not applying to clause (iv). At the least, it is not \"quite impossible that [the 1995] Congress could have intended\" this result. <i>Pub. Citizen v.

The FLSA defines \"employer\" as any \"person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and includes a public agency, but does not include any labor organization (other than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. § 203(d).</p>\n<p>[125]  <i>Id.</i> at 831-32 (arguing that FMLA distinguishes its definition of employer from that provided in the FLSA by separating the individual liability and public agency provisions).</p>\n<p>[126]  <i>Hewett,</i> 421 F.Supp.2d at 821 (citations omitted). This argument from negative implication appears to be in accord with Supreme Court decisions. <i>Cf. </i><i>Keene Corp. v.

This did create an ambiguous situation concerning the liability of public agency employees. But, in the FMLA, Congress explicitly took `Public Agency' out of the private employer definition and disconnected it from liability based on a person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer. Therefore, a better way to view the situation is that the FMLA corrected the ambiguity of the FLSA, as opposed to letting the ambiguity of the FLSA control the interpretation of the FMLA.\"); Note, <i>Individual Liability Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993: A Senseless Detour on the Road to Flexible Workplace,</i> 63 Brook.

Moreover, were this court to even entertain a debate of Congress's intentions on the matter, it would point out that this same argument cuts against the Individual Defendants: leaving employees of state agencies, like Plaintiff, without any remedy for a violation of their FMLA rights would dampen the incentive of employees to enter public service. <i>Cf.</i> Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Statement of Rep.

Gillen,</i> 614 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010), doing so is nonetheless in accord with the practice of the First Circuit, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Saysana,</i> 590 F.3d at 16 (concluding that the text of the statute was clear but nonetheless considering the agency's interpretation \"if we were to conclude that the statute were ambiguous\").</p>\n<p>[151]  The DOL has authority to promulgate guidelines for the FMLA. <i>See </i><i>Engelhardt v.

Richards Co.,</i> 472 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2654).</p>\n<p>[152]  The relevant portions of the Code of Federal Regulations are as follows:\n</p>\n<p>An employer covered by FMLA is any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce, who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Employers covered by FMLA also include any person acting, directly or indirectly, in the interest of a covered employer to any of the employees of the employer, any successor in interest of a covered employer, and any public agency. Public agencies are covered employers without regard to the number of employees employed. (<i>See</i> § 825.600.)</p>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 825.104(a).</p>\n<p>An \"employer\" includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer to any of the employer's employees. The definition of \"employer\" in section 3(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 203(d), similarly includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. As under the FLSA, individuals such as corporate officers \"acting in the interest of an employer\" are individually liable for any violations of the requirements of FMLA.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 825.104(d).</p>\n<p>[153]  <i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p>[154]  <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p>[155]  <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[156]  <i>Cf. </i><i>Rucker,</i> 471 F.3d at 12 (discussing the regulatory preamble).</p>\n<p>[157]  60 Fed.

Although the DOL cited Fifth and Sixth Circuit decisions concerning private employers, the Fifth Circuit had already held that a sheriff is an employer for purposes of the FLSA. <i>See </i><i>Lee v. Coahoma Cnty., Miss.,</i> 937 F.2d 220, 226 (5th Cir.1991). In response to the public agency, therefore, the DOL's reference to \"established FLSA case law\" likely meant to include individual liability for supervisors in public agencies.</p>\n<p>[159]  Additionally, although this court focuses on the text of the FMLA, some courts have been motivated by a non-textual argument to hold that supervisors in public agencies are not individually liable under the FMLA. Such a non-textual argument would not alter this court's conclusion. Specifically, if indeed the \"intention of the language\" is simply \"to ensure that someone will be held individually responsible for paying for or rectifying a FMLA violation,\" <i>Keene,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d at 777, then the FMLA (or the <i>Keene</i> court's interpretation of it) would indicate that the Individual Defendants should be responsible because the DEP retains Eleventh Amendment immunity, <i>see supra</i> Section III.A.1. Moreover, insofar as this decision is specific to the facts at issue here, holding the Individual Defendants liable would not promote \"redundancy, unnecessary complication, and the involvement of unnecessary persons who may be in a position not far removed from the employee who is bringing the lawsuit.\" <i>Keene,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d at 777. The Individual Defendants are not redundant or an unnecessary complication, of course, because of the immunity of the DEP.

This court assumes that qualified immunity may be applied in an FMLA case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 187 (holding that a public employee was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established that public employees are subject to individual liability under the FMLA); <i>Darby,</i> 287 F.3d at 681 (denying individual defendants' defense of qualified immunity to FMLA violation); cf. <i>Bartolomeo v.

Mason (\"Plaintiff\") has brought a suit against the DEP and various individuals who are or were employed by the DEP (\"the Individual Defendants\"). Plaintiff's <i>Complaint</i> alleges, among other counts, that the DEP and the Individual Defendants violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\").<sup>[1]</sup> Presently at issue is the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [#4] and the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [# 8]. For the following reasons, the DEP's <i>Motion</i> is ALLOWED and the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion</i> is ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Background</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Factual Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>From November 5, 1995 to January 31, 2008, Plaintiff was an employee of the DEP.<sup>[3]</sup> While employed at the DEP, Plaintiff suffered from asthma, hearing problems, diverticulitis, stress/hypertension, and anxiety.<sup>[4]</sup> These conditions interfere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> with Plaintiff's major life functions of sleeping, concentrating, interacting with others, learning, and working.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, Plaintiff was diagnosed with chronic depression in 2003 and with \"high blood pressure/hypertension\" in 2005.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2007, the DEP increased Plaintiff's workload, responsibilities, and duties, thereby exacerbating Plaintiff's condition.<sup>[7]</sup> Around August of 2007, Plaintiff informed Defendant d'Hedouville and \"DEP Management\" of his specific medical impairments, that the increased responsibility at work was exacerbating his condition, and that his impairment was interfering with his ability to work.<sup>[8]</sup> Plaintiff sought treatment for these conditions in September and October of 2007.<sup>[9]</sup> In particular, he was hospitalized on October 3, 2007 and October 6, 2007.<sup>[10]</sup> The DEP knew or should have known about Plaintiff's hospitalization.<sup>[11]</sup> Plaintiff used his accrued sick and vacation time when absent from work.<sup>[12]</sup> Despite Plaintiff's hospitalization and reporting of his medical impairments, Defendant d'Hedouville did not inform Plaintiff of his rights under the FMLA.<sup>[13]</sup> The DEP allegedly subjected Plaintiff to additional adverse employment actions, such as issuing Plaintiff a written warning on November 16, 2007 allegedly because of Plaintiff's impairments.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 17, 2007, the DEP convened a meeting about Plaintiff's work performance, at which Plaintiff alleges that he was denied his <i>Weingarten</i> rights.<sup>[15]</sup> On November 28, 2007, based upon information gathered at the November 17 meeting, the DEP suspended Plaintiff for five business days for lack of veracity, poor work performance, and insubordination.<sup>[16]</sup> While serving his suspension, on November 29, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a medical note from a nurse practitioner indicating that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, dehydration, diarrhea, and significant weight loss.<sup>[17]</sup> On December 2, 2007, Plaintiff requested information regarding his FMLA rights from Defendant d'Hedouville and he forwarded the request to Defendants Massimo and Stolfa.<sup>[18]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> DEP, in particular Defendant Massimo, denied Plaintiff leave under the FMLA.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>On December 5, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a letter to Defendant Massimo.<sup>[20]</sup> The letter included a medical note informing the DEP that Plaintiff needed to take a leave of absence to treat his disabilities rather than return from his suspension.<sup>[21]</sup> Plaintiff also provided, on December 6, 2007, a \"Certification of Health Care Provider\" (\"Certification\") executed by his Nurse Practitioner \"Smith\" (\"NP Smith\"), mentioning Plaintiff's inability to work \"relative to\" Plaintiff's \"serious health condition.\"<sup>[22]</sup> On December 11, 2007, Defendant Massimo requested details about Plaintiff's ailment and noted that the Certification was not signed by a medical doctor.<sup>[23]</sup> On December 12, 2007, NP Smith notified the DEP that Plaintiff was diagnosed with high blood pressure, gastroenteritis, and sleep deprivation.<sup>[24]</sup> NP Smith also later notified the DEP that the stress level caused by the denial of FMLA leave would worsen Plaintiff's condition.<sup>[25]</sup> After multiple communications regarding the documentation for Plaintiff's requested leave, the DEP denied Plaintiff's request on December 23, 2007, because his request was not signed by a medical doctor, it failed to discuss the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition, and it failed to include the reasons why the medical leave was necessary.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>The DEP arranged an appointment for Plaintiff to obtain a second medical opinion with Dr. Morris,<sup>[27]</sup> at which the doctor stated to Plaintiff, \"I understand that you have been disciplined twice.\"<sup>[28]</sup> At the appointment, Plaintiff refused to sign a medical release.<sup>[29]</sup> Despite this fact, Dr. Morris provided his medical notes to the DEP.<sup>[30]</sup> On January 23, 2008, the DEP conducted a Pre-Termination hearing, at which Defendant Massimo was the Hearing Officer.<sup>[31]</sup> In response to Plaintiff's complaint of Defendant Massimo's bias (given his involvement in Plaintiff's FMLA denial), \"upper level management\" at the DEP refused to provide Plaintiff with an appeal.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p>On January 31, 2008, despite the Certification executed by NP Smith and that Plaintiff's impairments met the criteria for \"serious health condition[s]\" under the FMLA, Plaintiff was terminated based (at least partly) on Dr. Morris's second medical opinion.<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> B. <i>Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff filed a <i>Complaint</i> on December 4, 2009, naming the DEP along with the Individual Defendants.<sup>[34]</sup> The <i>Complaint</i> contained seven counts: (I) violation of Plaintiff's FMLA rights (namely, a violation of the personal medical leave provision by denying Plaintiff leave for a \"serious health condition\"); (II) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (III) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (IV) interference with advantageous business relations (only as to the Individual Defendants); (V) retaliation and inference with protected rights; (VI) invasion of privacy under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 214, section 1B (only as to the DEP and Defendant Massimo); and (VII) conversion (only as to the DEP).<sup>[35]</sup> Plaintiff sought punitive damages.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants and the DEP have filed separate <i>Motions to Dismiss.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must include factual allegations that, if taken as true, demonstrate a plausible claim for relief.<sup>[37]</sup> This court addresses the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> and the Individual Defendant's <i>Motion to Dismiss,</i> in that order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The DEP's Motion to Dismiss</i><sup>[38]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Count I Is Barred Against the DEP by the Eleventh Amendment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment prevents private individuals from suing non-consenting states in federal court.<sup>[39]</sup> This immunity also applies to \"arms\" of the state.<sup>[40]</sup> Although Congress has the power to abrogate that Eleventh Amendment immunity, such power may only be validly exercised if Congress both (a) \"`unequivocally intends to do so'\" and (b) \"`act(s) pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority,'\" such as the authority granted by Section 5 of the Fourteen Amendment.<sup>[41]</sup></p>\n<p>The FMLA entitles eligible employees to a certain amount of unpaid leave per year in four clearly specified situations: (1) the birth of a child; (2) the adoption of a child or placement of a foster child; (3) the need to care for a parent, child or spouse with a serious health condition (the \"family-care\" leave provision); and (4) the inability to work due to the employee's own serious health condition (the \"self-care\" or \"personal medical\" leave provision).<sup>[42]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> Only the personal medical leave provision is at issue here.<sup>[43]</sup></p>\n<p>The First Circuit held, in <i>Laro v. New Hampshire,</i><sup>[44]</sup> that \"the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA does not exhibit a sufficient congruence to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination to validly abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"<sup>[45]</sup> As a result, no private action for monetary damages may lie against state employers for violation of the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Two years after <i>Laro,</i> the Supreme Court held that Congress validly abrogated sovereign immunity such that state employees may maintain claims in federal court for their employers' failure to comply with the family-care provision of the FMLA.<sup>[46]</sup> The Court, however, did not address whether sovereign immunity is similarly abrogated for claims of a violation of the personal medical leave provision.<sup>[47]</sup> The prevailing law in the First Circuit, therefore, is that the Commonwealth retains Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims under the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.<sup>[48]</sup></p>\n<p>Because (1) the DEP is an agency of the Commonwealth<sup>[49]</sup> and (2) Plaintiff's FMLA claim against the DEP is based solely upon Plaintiff's exercise of the personal medical leave provision, Count I is barred as against the DEP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Count V Against the DEP, Alleging Retaliation, Fails to State a Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In Count V, Plaintiff alleges \"retaliation and interference with protected rights.\"<sup>[50]</sup> Construing the language of Count V in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he appears to raise two potential bases for his allegation of retaliation: (a) the exercise of his <i>Weingarten</i> rights and (b) the exercise of his FMLA rights.<sup>[51]</sup> Neither is a sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> basis to allow Plaintiff's claim to survive.</p>\n<p>Under the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), an employee under a union contract whose employer is subject to the NLRA has <i>Weingarten</i> rights: the employee is entitled to union representation at any meeting at which the employee reasonably believes that he or she will be disciplined.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\n<p>The DEP highlights that any <i>Weingarten</i> rights that Plaintiff might have would arise from his status as a union employee under his union's collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with the DEP, rather than an independent employment contract with the DEP.<sup>[53]</sup> The DEP also points out that only Plaintiff's union may enforce those rights by asserting and exhausting the applicable grievance procedures in the CBA.<sup>[54]</sup> Moreover, the applicable grievance procedures must be exhausted before relief is sought in court.<sup>[55]</sup> Plaintiff does not dispute any of these contentions.</p>\n<p>Given the above understanding, Plaintiff has failed to identify any legal grounds for a retaliation claim on the basis of <i>Weingarten</i> rights. Plaintiff has not shown that he is the type of an employee entitled to <i>Weingarten</i> rights. Moreover, Plaintiff has not shown that his union either asserted Plaintiff's rights or exhausted any applicable grievance procedures. Plaintiff therefore does not have a private right of action to enforce <i>Weingarten</i> rights.<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>Insofar as Plaintiff claims retaliation based upon his exercise of his FMLA rights under the personal medical leave provision,<sup>[57]</sup> his claim is also barred by the Eleventh Amendment. If Congress cannot validly abrogate sovereign immunity for claims based on the personal medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*356</span> leave provision of the FMLA because such claims are not related to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination, it must follow that Congress is similarly unable to abrogate sovereign immunity for retaliation claims based upon that same personal medical leave provision.<sup>[58]</sup> Plaintiff does not dispute this argument. Under any reading of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, therefore, Count V fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Plaintiff's State Law Claims Against the DEP Are Barred</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Eleventh Amendment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>All of Plaintiff's state law claims (Counts II, III, VI, and VII) against the DEP, a state agency, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment precludes suits in federal court against non-consenting states, state agencies, and state officials sued in their official capacities.<sup>[59]</sup> The bar applies \"regardless of whether the suit seeks damages or injunctive relief.\"<sup>[60]</sup> All of Plaintiff's state law claims are therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>The Massachusetts Tort Claims Act Bars Counts II, III, VI, and VII Against the DEP</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff's state law claims are also barred for other reasons. Counts II, VI, and VII state intentional torts: intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and conversion, respectively.<sup>[61]</sup> All three claims are barred against the DEP by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (\"MTCA\") because Section 10(c) of Chapter 258 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides that the Commonwealth cannot be held liable for any claim arising out of an intentional tort.<sup>[62]</sup> Accordingly, Counts II, VI, and VII fail as against the DEP and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Count III alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress against the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*357</span> DEP.<sup>[63]</sup> The MTCA, in providing a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims, outlines careful parameters for the Commonwealth's liability. In particular, the law provides that a \"civil action shall not be instituted against a public employer on a claim for damages under this chapter unless the claimant shall have first presented his claim in writing to the executive officer of such public employer within two years after the date upon which the cause of action arose.\"<sup>[64]</sup> Section Four's specification of presentment is a \"statutory prerequisite; compliance is a condition precedent to the assertion of a right created by the act.\"<sup>[65]</sup> A plaintiff's failure to present her claim in accordance with Section Four precludes bringing a claim for injuries under the MTCA.<sup>[66]</sup> Here, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the MTCA's presentment requirement was met. Plaintiff does not allege that he presented his claim. Neither the Attorney General's office nor the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs have any record of Plaintiff having presented his claim.<sup>[67]</sup> As a result, Count III is barred as against the DEP and is dismissed.<sup>[68]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants claim that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim on either of his federal counts: Count I, alleging a violation of the FMLA's personal medical leave provision; and Count V, alleging retaliation against Plaintiff for attempting to exercise his FMLA rights. The Individual Defendants argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit against them in their official capacities and that under the FMLA they are not liable in their individual capacities. The Individual Defendants additionally argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity. This court considers the Individual Defendants' arguments in seriatim.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Eleventh Amendment Immunity for Official Capacity Suits</i><sup>[69]</sup></p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants contend that state officials sued in their official capacities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*358</span> are entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.<sup>[70]</sup></p>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment has been construed by the Supreme Court to bar an action for damages against a state official because it is a suit against the official's office and \"`no different from a suit against the State itself.'\"<sup>[71]</sup> Congress can, however, abrogate states' and state officials' Eleventh Amendment immunity if Congress both (a) makes its intention \"unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" and (b) acts pursuant to a \"valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<sup>[72]</sup> Congress has satisfied the first of these two criteria by providing that employees may seek damages under the FMLA \"against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.\"<sup>[73]</sup> The First Circuit has held that Congress has failed to satisfy the second criterion, at least with reference to the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA that Plaintiff invokes.<sup>[74]</sup></p>\n<p>The First Circuit has held that the FMLA's personal medical leave provision \"does not exhibit a sufficient congruence to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination to validly abrogate\" the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the \"states as employers from private damages actions.\"<sup>[75]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiff's arguments referencing Judge Lipez's dissent in <i>Laro</i> are unavailing.<sup>[76]</sup> It is true that the Supreme Court determined in <i>Hibbs</i> that the family-care leave provision of the FMLA represents a valid abrogation of states' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[77]</sup> But the First Circuit's holding in <i>Laro</i>that the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity has not been validly abrogated by Congress's enactment of the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA<sup>[78]</sup>remains binding here.<sup>[79]</sup> The holding in <i>Laro</i> has \"not been modified by, let alone presented to, the First Circuit since the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> Court's decision in <i>Hibbs.</i>\"<sup>[80]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, insofar as Plaintiff brings this claim against the Individual Defendants in their official capacities, this claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Additionally, insofar as Plaintiff claims retaliation based upon the exercise of his FMLA rights under the personal medical leave provision,<sup>[81]</sup> this claim against the Individual Defendants in their official capacities is also barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<sup>[82]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>State Officials May Be Liable in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants argue that if they have been sued in their individual capacities, then they are still not liable under the personal medical leave provision of the FMLA.<sup>[83]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Plaintiff Has Sued the Individual Defendants in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, the Individuals Defendants argue that Plaintiff's failure to indicate that the suit is against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities means that this court should presume that the suit is an official-capacity suit.<sup>[84]</sup> Contrary to the Individual Defendants' assertion,<sup>[85]</sup> the First Circuit has addressed the issue and has adopted a \"course of proceedings\" test.<sup>[86]</sup> Under this test, the court examines the \"substance of the pleadings and the course of proceedings in order to determine whether the suit is for individual or official liability.\"<sup>[87]</sup> The underlying inquiry is whether a plaintiff's \"intention to hold a defendant personally liable can be ascertained fairly.\"<sup>[88]</sup> Relevant factors include the nature of a plaintiff's claims, requests for compensatory or punitive damages, and the nature of any defenses raised in response to the complaint.<sup>[89]</sup></p>\n<p>Much like in <i>Powell,</i> the course of proceedings here gave the Individual Defendants fair notice that they were being sued in their individual capacities. First, Plaintiff's <i>Complaint</i> contained a prayer for punitive damages.<sup>[90]</sup> Although many courts have held that punitive damages cannot be recovered in an FMLA action,<sup>[91]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*360</span> at the least the mention of punitive damages would likely charge the Individual Defendants with notice of an individual-capacity suit. Second, the Individual Defendants raised a qualified immunity defense,<sup>[92]</sup> which indicates that the Individual Defendants interpreted Plaintiff's action as being against them personally.<sup>[93]</sup> Moreover, Plaintiffs's counsel even confirmed at a February 17, 2011 Motion Hearing in front of this court that Plaintiff was suing the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities, not in their official capacities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>The Relevant FMLA Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The next issue is whether the Individual Defendants, who are employees and supervisors for a public agency, are individually liable for violations of the FMLA.<sup>[94]</sup> The Individual Defendants argue that the FMLA's language only applies to employers and that they are not liable because they are not employers under the FMLA.<sup>[95]</sup></p>\n<p>Resolution of this legal question depends on the FMLA's definition of \"employer,\" which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>(4) Employer. (A) In general. The term \"employer\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) means any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) includes</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(I) any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(II) any successor in interest of an employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iii) includes any \"public agency\", as defined in section 3(x) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(x)); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iv) includes the General Accounting Office [Government Accountability Office] and the Library of Congress.<sup>[96]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Because the individual liability provision (clause (ii)(I)) is separate from the provision which includes public agencies (clause (iv)), it is sharply contested whether the FMLA's definition of \"employer\" applies to supervisors of public agencies.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court and the First Circuit have yet to directly address this issue.<sup>[97]</sup> District courts within the First Circuit have differed in their outcomes.<sup>[98]</sup> But <span class=\"star-pagination\">*361</span> the decisions of the other courts within the First Circuit are not entirely on point for the purposes of this decision. The rationale for those cases is slightly removed from the debate here concerning whether the FMLA attaches individual liability to public employees.<sup>[99]</sup></p>\n<p>In the decisions that directly address the matter, there is a nationwide split among both Courts of Appeals and district courts.<sup>[100]</sup> On the one hand, the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that public employees cannot be held individually liable under the FMLA.<sup>[101]</sup> In holding that the FMLA's individual liability provision \"does not extend to public agencies,\"<sup>[102]</sup> the Sixth Circuit in <i>Mitchell</i> provided three detailed textual reasons for its holding.<sup>[103]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits have taken the opposite position and concluded that public employees may be held individually liable under the FMLA.<sup>[104]</sup> This was the majority position, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*362</span> at least as of 2006.<sup>[105]</sup> This court will accordingly refer to the Fifth and Eighth Circuits' view as the majority position.<sup>[106]</sup> The Fifth and Eighth Circuits interpreted the text of the FMLA as permitting a public employee to be individually liable if the public employee violated the FMLA and \"act[ed], directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer.\"<sup>[107]</sup> The Fifth Circuit in <i>Modica</i> also sequentially rejected the three reasons relied upon by the Sixth Circuit in <i>Mitchell.</i><sup>[108]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>The Individual Defendants May Be Liable in Their Individual Capacities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As the First Circuit has instructed in considering the FMLA, this court's analysis begins \"with the language of the statute and ask `whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.'\"<sup>[109]</sup> If Congress's intent is clear, \"that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\"<sup>[110]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*363</span> Based on a fair reading of the FMLA's text, this court concludes that the majority position is more convincing. According to Section 2611(4)(A), the term \"employer\" includes public agencies. The term \"employer\" also includes any person who acts \"directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such an employer.\" It follows that an individual acting in the interest of a public agency can be an \"employer.\" The Individual Defendants, therefore, as supervisors in a public agency, may be subject to individual liability under the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Because the Individual Defendants' arguments originate from <i>Mitchell,</i><sup>[111]</sup> this court will explain why the <i>Mitchell</i> court's analysis in less persuasive than the majority position.</p>\n<p>The <i>Mitchell</i> court first focused on the separation of the individual liability provision and public agency provision into two clauses, arguing that there is no relationship between clauses (ii)-(iv).<sup>[112]</sup> The court reasoned that \"the separation of otherwise related concepts (i.e., what the term `employer' `includes') into distinctly enumerated clauses compels an interpretation that treats each clause in an independent manner.\"<sup>[113]</sup> There is, however, no compelling logic for such a conclusion. If the provisions were not distinctly enumerated, but grouped together, it could be just as arguable whether \"employer\" includes \"any person who acts . . . in the interest of an employer\" that is a \"public agency.\"<sup>[114]</sup> And as other courts have pointed out, two grammatical items(1) the word \"and\" that follows clause (iii) and (2) the em dash (\"\") that follows the term \"employer\" (at the top of the definition)suggest a relationship between the individual liability and public agency provisions.<sup>[115]</sup> Moreover, although the relevant Senate committee report is not dispositive of the issue, it does slightly weigh in favor of this court's reading.<sup>[116]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*364</span> The <i>Mitchell</i> court next argued that having clauses (i)-(iv) included in the term \"employer\" would yield an interpretation that \"renders other provisions of the statute superfluous\" and create \"several oddities.\"<sup>[117]</sup> Each oddity or apparent superfluous aspect has been convincingly refuted by other courts. First, Section 2611(4)(B), providing that a public agency is considered a \"person engaged in commerce or in an industry or activity affecting commerce,\" is not rendered superfluous because its purpose is to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving that a public agency is engaged in commerce.<sup>[118]</sup> Second, an interpretation that holds supervisors of public agencies individually liable is not redundant, particularly given that holding a supervisor in the private sector liable yields an identical result.<sup>[119]</sup> Third, this court's interpretation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*365</span> does not create an \"absurdity\" through the successor-in-interest clause ((ii)(II)) applying to the Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") and Library of Congress (clause iv).<sup>[120]</sup> Clause (iv) was only included by a 1995 amendment<sup>[121]</sup> and this unanticipated effect on the 1993 law should not change the \"straightforward language of the clauses\" with which this court is here concerned.<sup>[122]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court lastly argued that a definition of \"employer\" that \"incorporates the individual liability and public agency provision[s] into a single clause is substantially similar to, if not identical,\"<sup>[123]</sup> to definition of employer in the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\").<sup>[124]</sup> Had Congress intended the FMLA and FLSA's definitions of \"employer\" to be identical, the <i>Mitchell</i> court argued, it would have expressly adopted the FLSA's definition.<sup>[125]</sup> This argument is unconvincing for four reasons, three of which have been succinctly expressed by another court:</p>\n<blockquote>[1][I]t would have been curious for the FMLA to have incorporated the FLSA's definition of \"employer,\" as that definition makes explicit reference to \"labor organizations.\" Such a reference in the context of the Family and Medical Leave Act would have been unnecessary and a likely cause of confusion. [2] In any event, though the FMLA does adopt several of the FSLA's [sic] provisions by direct reference, in other instances it does not. <i>Compare</i> 29 U.S.C. § 2611(1) (defining \"commerce\"), with 29 U.S.C. § 203(b) (same). . . . [3][I]f Congress wanted to shield public officials from liability under the FMLA, it would have done so explicitly; indeed, Congress did so in the FLSA when it excluded from the definition of \"employer\" \"any labor organization (other than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.\" Congress could have as easily included a provision in Section 2611(4) limiting the liability of public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*366</span> agencies to the agencies themselves. Congress chose not to do so, and this Court is not prepared to read into the statute that effect.<sup>[126]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth, various courts have concluded that the FMLA's definition of \"employer\" is virtually identical to the FLSA's definition of \"employer,\" and the term \"employer\" should be interpreted the same way under both statutes.<sup>[127]</sup></p>\n<p>Although this court's reasoning does not rely solely on the analogy between the FMLA and FLSA,<sup>[128]</sup> the First Circuit may find otherwise.<sup>[129]</sup> Accordingly, the First Circuit's relevant FLSA decisions indicate that the Individual Defendants may still be held individually liable. Specifically, the First Circuit interprets the FLSA's definition of \"employer\" pursuant to an \"economic reality\" analysis.<sup>[130]</sup> The First Circuit has determined that several factors are important to the personal liability analysis, including the individual's ownership interest, degree of control over the corporation's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*367</span> financial affairs and compensation practices, and role in \"caus[ing] the corporation to compensate (or not to compensate) employees in accordance with the FLSA.\"<sup>[131]</sup> With this test and factors in mind, the First Circuit has affirmed a president of a corporation being held liable because he did not just have \"some supervisory control over other employees\" but had \"ultimate control over the business's day-to-day operations.\"<sup>[132]</sup> Moreover, he was \"instrumental\" in \"causing\" the corporation to violate the FLSA because he was the \"corporate officer principally in charge of directing employment practices, such as hiring and firing employees, requiring employees to attend meetings unpaid, and setting employees' wages and schedules.\"<sup>[133]</sup> The First Circuit's \"economic reality\" has been applied in the FMLA context by district courts in the First Circuit, albeit in the context of a supervisor working for a private company.<sup>[134]</sup></p>\n<p>Were the First Circuit to apply this test to the context of a supervisor of a \"public agency,\"<sup>[135]</sup> the Individual Defendants' <i>Motion</i> would likely still be denied. All of the Individual Defendants are alleged to have been instrumental in causing the violation of Plaintiff's FMLA rights.<sup>[136]</sup> Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*368</span> Massimo and d'Hedouville were allegedly particularly instrumental in some violations.<sup>[137]</sup> Defendant Massimo not only allegedly denied Plaintiff leave under the FMLA,<sup>[138]</sup> but also violated Plaintiff's FMLA rights in other ways.<sup>[139]</sup> Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant d'Hedouville of Plaintiff's personal medical conditions<sup>[140]</sup> and Defendant d'Hedouville did not inform Plaintiff of his FMLA rights.<sup>[141]</sup> Although Defendants Burt, McGillicuddy, and Stolfa were not as often involved with Plaintiff, they nonetheless appear to be responsible for making decisions that contributed to the alleged violations.<sup>[142]</sup> These three Defendants also appear to have exercised a sufficient level of control, at least in regards to the power to hire and fire employees.<sup>[143]</sup> Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that all of the Individual Defendants retaliated against him by terminating him for requesting FMLA leave.<sup>[144]</sup> Plaintiff has therefore adequately pled that the Individual Defendants were instrumental in causing the violation of his FMLA rights.<sup>[145]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> On a separate note, the Individual Defendants argue that Congress did not intend to hold individuals working for public agencies liable because it would be a disincentive to enter public service.<sup>[146]</sup> This argument is not persuasive for several reasons. First, this court's conclusion is rooted in the plain meaning of the statute and it need not venture into extensive speculations concerning congressional intent and purpose behind the FMLA.<sup>[147]</sup> Second, the Individual Defendants cite authoritycase law, congressional history, or otherto support their argument. Third, insofar as this is an invocation of the \"dog that did not bark\" canon,<sup>[148]</sup> the canon does not apply because there is no indication that a potential disincentive to enter public service \"would be so extreme as to have inevitably provoked comment in Congress.\"<sup>[149]</sup></p>\n<p>This court's conclusion is based on the FMLA's clear text. Recognizing, however, that another court might hold that the FMLA is ambiguous,<sup>[150]</sup> this court notes that the Department of Labor's (\"DOL\") interpretations could support the view that supervisors in public agencies are individually liable.<sup>[151]</sup> The <i>Modica</i> and <i>Mitchell</i> courts cited to the same provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations defining \"employer\" and both courts claimed that those provisions supported their contrary conclusions.<sup>[152]</sup> Whereas the <i>Modica</i> court found <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> that the definition of \"employer\" under the FMLA was \"virtually the same\" as the definition in the FLSA (but for the inclusion of successors in interest and exclusion of labor organizations),<sup>[153]</sup> the <i>Mitchell</i> court thought the separation between \"public agency\" and \"directly or indirectly\" in one definition supported its interpretation.<sup>[154]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court also highlighted the mention of \"corporate officers\" in another definition.<sup>[155]</sup> The <i>Mitchell</i> court's view of the agency's final rule is not convincing for two reasons. First, no logic compels the <i>Mitchell</i> court's interpretation of the regulations. The clause \"directly or indirectly\" can still coherently relate to the \"public agency\" clause such that a supervisor within a public agency may be an \"employer.\" Second, the regulatory preamble (or \"Summary of Major Comments\") explaining the regulation at issuethe definition of \"employer\"suggests that the DOL agrees with this court's conclusion.<sup>[156]</sup> Specifically, a public agency with jurisdiction over public (and private) entities questioned \"whether managers or supervisors can be held personally liable\" under the FMLA.<sup>[157]</sup> In response to this question from a public agency, the DOL clarified that not only \"corporate officers\" but \"managers and supervisors\" can also be held individually liable.<sup>[158]</sup> The DOL's interpretations, therefore, reinforce this court's conclusion, which is rooted in the statutory text, that supervisors in public agencies may be held individually liable for violations of the FMLA.<sup>[159]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> 3. <i>The Individual Defendants Are Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Individual Defendants argue that even if they fall within the definition of an \"employer\" under the FMLA and are subject to individual liability, they are entitled to qualified immunity because their liability had not been \"clearly established.\"<sup>[160]</sup> The Individual Defendants provide no First Circuit case law to support the application of qualified immunity here.<sup>[161]</sup> The Individual Defendants argue solely that they should receive qualified immunity because of legal uncertainty over the individual liability of public officials.<sup>[162]</sup> This argument misconstrues the First Circuit's method of analyzing a qualified immunity claim. A claim of qualified immunity concerns the Individual Defendants' underlying <i>conduct</i> that gives rise to liability, not their prospective <i>liability</i> for violating a statute.<sup>[163]</sup> Any doubt as to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> Individual Defendants' liability is irrelevant because Plaintiff, as an employee of a public agency, had clearly established rights under the FMLA.<sup>[164]</sup> This court therefore focuses its argument below on the proper qualified immunity analysis.<sup>[165]</sup></p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has reaffirmed, the doctrine of qualified immunity \"protects government officials `from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\"<sup>[166]</sup> To determine whether a particular officer is entitled to qualified immunity, a \"court must decide: (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the Plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional [or statutory] right; and (2) if so, whether the right was `clearly established at the time of the defendant's alleged violation.'\"<sup>[167]</sup> The First Circuit has explained that the second step of the qualified immunity analysis has two aspects: \"(1) `the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation' and (2) whether, on the facts of the case, a `reasonable defendant would have understood that this conduct violated the Plaintiff's constitutional [or statutory] rights.'\"<sup>[168]</sup> A defendant, therefore, is entitled to qualified immunity if a \"reasonable official would not have understood\" that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> her conduct violated a plaintiff's constitutional or statutory rights.<sup>[169]</sup> This prong of the inquiry is highly fact-specific.<sup>[170]</sup> In conducting this analysis, \"a court should `use its full knowledge of its own [and other relevant] precedents.'\"<sup>[171]</sup> Under the above analysis, both of the prongs of the qualified immunity analysis have been met.<sup>[172]</sup> First, Plaintiff has alleged conduct that constitutes a violation of the FMLA. The Individual Defendants allegedly failed to comply with statutory procedures. For instance, the Individual Defendants allegedly failed to provide Plaintiff with a third health care provider to give a binding final opinion to resolve the conflict between certifying doctors.<sup>[173]</sup> Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave was denied.<sup>[174]</sup> Plaintiff has alleged interference with his FMLA rights<sup>[175]</sup> and retaliation for his exercise of those rights.<sup>[176]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, between late 2007 and early 2008,<sup>[177]</sup> this conduct was clearly established as a violation of the FMLA. Applying the two subsidiary issues on the second prong, this court first determines that the law was clear in general that it was a violation of the FMLA for the Individual Defendants to engage in the conduct at issue. These violated rights include<sup>[178]</sup> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> following: (a) the employers' interference with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by failing to provide FMLA leave and not discharging their obligations to inquire; and (b) terminating Plaintiff in retaliation for his requesting FMLA leave.<sup>[179]</sup> Failing to provide Plaintiff's requested leave could be a violation of the FMLA.<sup>[180]</sup> The Individual Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff individualized notice of the FMLA would also be a violation, at least if it harmed or prejudiced Plaintiff.<sup>[181]</sup> The Individual Defendants' alleged acts of retaliation (e.g., termination) were clearly established as violations of the FMLA.<sup>[182]</sup> Moreover, existing case law gave the Individual Defendants notice that it was potentially a violation of the FMLA to not allow for a third health care provider to resolve the conflict between certifying doctors.<sup>[183]</sup> Other courts, including controlling authority in at least one instance,<sup>[184]</sup> have noted that similar conduct constituted violations of the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Not only was the law generally clear that the Individual Defendants' conduct violated Plaintiff's FMLA rights, but, turning to the second subsidiary issue, on the facts of the case, a reasonable, defendant would have understood that this conduct violated the Plaintiff's FMLA rights. An objectively reasonable defendant would have understood that not providing notice to Plaintiff of his FMLA rights, denying Plaintiff his request for FMLA leave, failing to pursue its obligation to inquire, and retaliating against Plaintiff for exercise of his rights could violate Plaintiff's rights under the FMLA. Other courts have even found that such rights under the FMLA are clearly established.<sup>[185]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> As explained above, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show that the Individual Defendants' conduct violated his FMLA rights. The law at the time was clearly established to put the Individual Defendants on notice that their conduct violated the FMLA. Lastly, a reasonable defendant under the same circumstances as the Individual Defendants would have understood that the conduct at issue violated Plaintiff's statutory rights. The Individual Defendants are therefore not entitled to a defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, including Eleventh Amendment immunity, Plaintiff's failure to state a claim, and MTCA requirements, the DEP's <i>Motion to Dismiss</i> [# 8] is ALLOWED.</p>\n<p>The Individual Defendants are immune from this suit in their official capacities.

The <i>Mitchell</i> court also argued that clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) could not be read together because public agencies do not have to meet the fifty employee requirement to be considered an employer under the FMLA. <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 831 (\"`Public agencies are covered employers without regard to the number of employees employed.'\" (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.104(a))). This argument, for two reasons, does not prove that supervisors in public agencies cannot be held individually liable. First, there is no reason in the structure or grammar of the statute that clause (ii)(I) should only modify clause (i) and not modify clause (iii). The non-relation of clause (iii) to clause (i) does not require clause (ii)(I) to apply only to clause (i) and not to clause (iii). In fact, this reading of the text, that clause (ii)(I) applies to both clauses (iii) and (i), is supported by the views of the relevant Senate committee in the legislative history. <i>See supra</i> note 116 and accompanying text. Second, clause (iii) was likely separated from clause (i) for a different reason. Clause (i) includes as employers only those who employ \"50 or more employees.\" Congress was expressly and repeatedly concerned about the FMLA's impact (or lack thereof) on small businesses. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.

Moreover, were this court to even entertain a debate of Congress's intentions on the matter, it would point out that this same argument cuts against the Individual Defendants: leaving employees of state agencies, like Plaintiff, without any remedy for a violation of their FMLA rights would dampen the incentive of employees to enter public service. <i>Cf.</i> Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Statement of Rep. Clay (Sponsor), H381 (House of Representatives, Feb. 3, 1993) (In the Committee of the Whole) (\"Our Government should be a model employer.

S.P. Richards Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202570\"><a href=\"/opinion/202570/engelhardt-v-sp-richards-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2654).</p>\n<p>[152]  The relevant portions of the Code of Federal Regulations are as follows:\n</p>\n<p>An employer covered by FMLA is any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce, who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Employers covered by FMLA also include any person acting, directly or indirectly, in the interest of a covered employer to any of the employees of the employer, any successor in interest of a covered employer, and any public agency. Public agencies are covered employers without regard to the number of employees employed. (<i>See</i> § 825.600.)</p>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 825.104(a).</p>\n<p>An \"employer\" includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer to any of the employer's employees. The definition of \"employer\" in section 3(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 203(d), similarly includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. As under the FLSA, individuals such as corporate officers \"acting in the interest of an employer\" are individually liable for any violations of the requirements of FMLA.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 825.104(d).</p>\n<p>[153]  <i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p>[154]  <i>Mitchell,</i> 343 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p>[155]  <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[156]  <i>Cf. </i><i>Rucker,</i> 471 F.3d at 12 (discussing the regulatory preamble).</p>\n<p>[157]  60 Fed.

The inquiring agency was the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. <i>See</i> About, California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/DFEH/About/ Default.aspx (last visited Mar. 25, 2011).</p>\n<p>[158]  60 Fed.Reg. at 2181 (\"[The] FMLA's definition of `employer' is the same as the . . . FLSA insofar as it includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer to any of the employer's employees. Under established FLSA case law, corporate officers, managers and supervisors acting in the interest of an employer can be held individually liable for violations of the law.\" (citation omitted)). Although the DOL cited Fifth and Sixth Circuit decisions concerning private employers, the Fifth Circuit had already held that a sheriff is an employer for purposes of the FLSA. <i>See </i><i>Lee v. Coahoma Cnty., Miss.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563827\"><a href=\"/opinion/563827/isaac-lee-cross-appellees-v-coahoma-county-mississippi-cross-appellants/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 226 (5th Cir.1991). In response to the public agency, therefore, the DOL's reference to \"established FLSA case law\" likely meant to include individual liability for supervisors in public agencies.</p>\n<p>[159]  Additionally, although this court focuses on the text of the FMLA, some courts have been motivated by a non-textual argument to hold that supervisors in public agencies are not individually liable under the FMLA. Such a non-textual argument would not alter this court's conclusion. Specifically, if indeed the \"intention of the language\" is simply \"to ensure that someone will be held individually responsible for paying for or rectifying a FMLA violation,\" <i>Keene,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d at 777, then the FMLA (or the <i>Keene</i> court's interpretation of it) would indicate that the Individual Defendants should be responsible because the DEP retains Eleventh Amendment immunity, <i>see supra</i> Section III.A.1. Moreover, insofar as this decision is specific to the facts at issue here, holding the Individual Defendants liable would not promote \"redundancy, unnecessary complication, and the involvement of unnecessary persons who may be in a position not far removed from the employee who is bringing the lawsuit.\" <i>Keene,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d at 777. The Individual Defendants are not redundant or an unnecessary complication, of course, because of the immunity of the DEP. They are not unnecessary persons not far removed from Plaintiff because all of them, as explained below, are alleged to have played a role in the conduct that constituted violations of Plaintiff's FMLA rights.</p>\n<p>[160]  Indiv.

Moreover, district courts in the First Circuit discussing individual liability in an FMLA action do not raise the issue of qualified immunity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Meara,</i> 27 F.Supp.2d at 291. This court assumes that qualified immunity may be applied in an FMLA case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Modica,</i> 465 F.3d at 187 (holding that a public employee was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established that public employees are subject to individual liability under the FMLA); <i>Darby,</i> 287 F.3d at 681 (denying individual defendants' defense of qualified immunity to FMLA violation); cf. <i>Bartolomeo v.

Accordingly, a violation of Plaintiff's rights would be unlawful, even if no one could be held liable for such a violation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sueiro Vazquez v.

Additionally, the only two decisions issued in the District of Massachusetts on the matter had held supervisors individually liable. <i>See supra</i> note 98.
