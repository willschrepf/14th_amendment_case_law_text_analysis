LEHMAN\n                              OPINION\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case presents the question whether Washington state\nlaw creates a liberty interest in an inmate’s early release into\ncommunity custody that is protected under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it does.\nWe conclude, however, that this right was not clearly estab-\nlished at the time of the facts giving rise to this case. We\ntherefore affirm the district court’s grant of qualified immu-\nnity.\n\n          I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n   In August 1999, Joseph Dale Carver pled guilty to child\nmolestation in the third degree. He was sentenced to fifty-four\nmonths of confinement in the custody of the Washington\nState Department of Corrections (“DOC” or “Department”).\nBecause he was a sex offender, state law also required that\nCarver be sentenced to a term of community custody to begin\n“either upon completion of the term of confinement or at such\ntime as [he] is transferred to community custody in lieu of\nearned release[.]” See WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.710(1)\n(2006).1 He was sentenced to a thirty-six-month period of\ncommunity custody.\n  1\n    The Washington Court of Appeals has explained that “[c]ommunity\ncustody is the intense monitoring of an offender in the community for a\nperiod of at least one year after release or transfer from confinement.\nAlthough it has other purposes, community custody continues in the\nnature of punishment, and is not equivalent to general release.” In re\nCrowder, 985 P.2d 944, 945 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999). Offenders in commu-\nnity custody live in a residence pre-approved by the DOC and are subject\nto mandatory and discretionary conditions imposed by either the DOC or\nthe sentencing court. See, e.g., WASH. REV. CODE §§ 9.94A.710(2)-(3),\n9.94A.700(4)-(5) (listing mandatory and discretionary conditions imposed\non offenders subject to community custody including, inter alia, reporting\nrequirements, payment of supervision fees, and prohibitions against pos-\nsession of controlled substances and consumption of alcohol).\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6515\n   Carver’s good behavior as a prisoner earned him an early\nrelease date of June 27, 2002.2 Carver’s sex offense, however,\nprecluded him from being released on his earned date. WASH.\nREV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(a) (2006). Rather, state law pro-\nvides that sex offenders may become eligible for transfer to\ncommunity custody in lieu of early release. Id. Eligibility for\ntransfer to community custody is determined based on “re-\nlease plan[s]” submitted by offenders. WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(c). In March 2002, Carver submitted a release\nplan. His plan was denied in April 2002, pursuant to a DOC\npolicy then in effect which provided for the categorical denial\nof release plans of offenders, like Carver, whom the Depart-\nment determined “appear[ed] to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and [who had] been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .” DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (May 4,\n2001).3 As a result of the denial of his proposed release plan,\nCarver served his full term of confinement.\n\n   In September 2004, Carver filed a civil rights suit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, asserting that DOC officials denied him early\nrelease into community custody without affording him due\nprocess of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.4 The district\ncourt, adopting the report and recommendation of the magis-\ntrate judge, granted the DOC officials’ motion for summary\njudgment on two principal grounds: one, that Washington law\ndoes not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity custody and therefore Carver did not have a due process\n  2\n     For reasons that are not explained in the record before us, this date was\nsubsequently pushed back to January 13, 2003.\n   3\n     As we explain infra, this policy was subsequently struck down by the\nWashington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d 635, 640 (Wash.\nCt. App. 2002) (holding “DOC Policy 350.200 . . . violates the governing\nstatutes”).\n   4\n     Carver’s original complaint named as a defendant only Joseph Leh-\nman, secretary of the DOC at the time that Carver’s release plan was\ndenied. In his amended complaint, Carver named two additional defen-\ndants, Kimberley Acker and Victoria Roberts, both DOC officials\ninvolved in making end of sentence review determinations.\n\f6516                     CARVER v. LEHMAN\nright protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and two, that\neven if such a right existed, Defendant Lehman was entitled\nto qualified immunity.5 Carver timely appealed. We have\njurisdiction to review the district court’s determination pursu-\nant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we review de novo its grant of\nsummary judgment and finding of qualified immunity. See\nMabe v. San Bernardino County, Dep’t of Pub. Soc. Servs.,\n237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001); Galen v. County of Los\nAngeles, 477 F.3d 652, 658 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n   [1] The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty,\nor property, without due process of law . . . .” U.S. CONST.\namend. XIV, § 1. Our analysis of due process claims proceeds\nin two steps. “[T]he first asks whether there exists a liberty or\nproperty interest which has been interfered with by the State;\nthe second examines whether the procedures attendant upon\nthat deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.” Ky. Dep’t of\nCorr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989) (citation omit-\nted).\n\n   [2] We have recognized that “[a] liberty interest may arise\nfrom either of two sources: the due process clause itself or\nstate law.” Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, 1089 (9th\nCir. 1986). Carver concedes that the Due Process Clause does\nnot create a liberty interest in an inmate’s “conditional[ ]\nrelease[ ] before the expiration of a valid sentence.” Green-\nholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Corr. Complex,\n442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979). Rather, he argues that Washington\nstate’s statutory scheme governing early release into commu-\n  5\n    The district court also adopted the magistrate judge’s finding that\nDefendants Acker and Roberts were entitled to summary judgment\nbecause Carver failed to show that “these defendants played any part in\nenacting the policy that precluded [Carver] from being considered for\nrelease.” Carver does not appeal this portion of the judgment below.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                            6517\nnity custody “uses mandatory language, ‘creat[ing] a pre-\nsumption that . . . release will be granted’ . . . unless certain\ndesignated findings are made, and thereby gives rise to a con-\nstitutional liberty interest.” McQuillion v. Duncan, 306 F.3d\n895, 901 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Greenholtz, 442 U.S. at 12;\nciting Bd. of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 377-78 (1987)).\nAs in prior cases, our task here is to apply the well-established\nmandatory language rule governing state-created liberty inter-\nests set forth by the Supreme Court in Greenholtz and Allen\nto the Washington statutory scheme at issue.6 See, e.g., Sass\nv. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, 461 F.3d 1123, 1127-28 (9th Cir.\n2006) (holding California law creates a liberty interest in\nparole); Biggs v. Terhune, 334 F.3d 910, 914 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(same); McQuillion, 306 F.3d at 901-902 (same); Bermudez\nv. Duenas, 936 F.2d 1064, 1065-66 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding\nGuam law creates a liberty interest in parole); Baumann v.\nAriz. Dep’t of Corr., 754 F.2d 841, 843-45 (9th Cir. 1989)\n(holding Arizona law does not create a liberty interest in cus-\ntodial release); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 869 F.2d\n   6\n     In his reply brief, Lehman argued that Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472\n(1995) should control our liberty interest inquiry. In Sandin, the Supreme\nCourt considered a challenge to a prison regulation imposing disciplinary\nsegregation for misconduct. Id. at 475-77. In holding that the regulation\ndid not create a liberty interest, the Court did not apply the “mandatory\nlanguage” framework of Greenholtz and Allen. Id. at 481-86. Instead, it\nfocused on whether the challenged restraint arising from the regulation\n“impose[d] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. See also Wilkinson v. Austin, 545\nU.S. 209, 222-224 (2005) (applying Sandin to determine whether Ohio\ninmates have a liberty interest in avoiding placement in a “supermax”\nprison). As Lehman properly conceded in his supplemental submissions to\nthe court, we have since held that Sandin’s holding was limited to “the\nseparate but related question of when due process liberty interests are cre-\nated by internal prison regulations.” McQuillion, 306 F.3d at 902-03\n(emphasis added). See also Sass, 461 F.3d at 1127 n.3 (explaining that this\ncourt has “consistently rejected th[e] argument” that Sandin eliminated the\n“ ‘mandatory language’ approach of Greenholtz and Allen). Accordingly,\nwe continue to apply the “mandatory language” rule set forth in Green-\nholtz and Allen in order to determine whether Washington’s statutory\nscheme creates a liberty interest in early release into community custody.\n\f6518                    CARVER v. LEHMAN\n461, 469-70 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding Idaho law does not\ncreate a liberty interest in parole). We turn to that task now.\n\n A.    The Washington statutory scheme governing early\n           release into community custody creates a\n           constitutionally protected liberty interest.\n\n   Washington law mandates that an individual convicted of\na sex offense be sentenced to a term of community custody\nthat “shall begin either upon completion of the term of con-\nfinement or at such time as the offender is transferred to com-\nmunity custody in lieu of earned release.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.710(1). Unlike other inmates, then, a convicted sex\noffender who accrues “earned release time . . . for good\nbehavior and good performance” is not entitled to early\nrelease; rather, he is eligible for transfer into community cus-\ntody at an earlier date. WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(1),\n(2)(a). The law requires the DOC to develop a program to\neffectuate the transfer to community custody of such inmates.\nSee WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(1). As part of that pro-\ngram, the Department must “require the offender to propose\na release plan that includes an approved residence and living\narrangement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(c). The law\nthen describes how the DOC should evaluate such release\nplans, stating:\n\n      The department may deny transfer to community\n      custody status in lieu of earned release time pursuant\n      to subsection (1) of this section if the department\n      determines an offender’s release plan, including pro-\n      posed residence location and living arrangements,\n      [1] may violate the conditions of the sentence or\n      conditions of supervision, [2] place the offender at\n      risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, [3]\n      place the offender at risk to reoffend, or [4] present\n      a risk to victim safety or community safety.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6519\nWASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (emphasis added).7\n\n   In order to comply with the statutory mandate, the DOC\npromulgated Policy Directive 350.200. Under the version of\nthis policy in force when Carver submitted his release plan,\nthe DOC instructed that release plans of sex offenders be\nassessed to determine “the degree of risk for victims and\npotential victims of similar age or circumstances” and to\nensure that, subject to certain exceptions, “[s]ex offenders will\nnot return to a residence where minor victim(s) or other chil-\ndren of similar age are present in the residence[.]” DOC Pol-\nicy Directive 350.200 (May 4, 2001). The Policy Directive\nspecified that a residence proposed by an offender within a\nrelease plan may be denied if the proposed location will place\nthe offender in violation of court-imposed conditions, at the\nlikely risk to re-offend, or in close proximity to the minor vic-\ntim(s), school, child care center, playground, or other facilities\nwhere children of similar age and circumstances surrounding\nthe conviction are present and who may be put at substantial\nrisk of harm by the offender residing at that location.8 The\n  7\n     The provision goes on to state that “[t]he department’s authority under\nthis section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\nstatutory provision regarding conditions for community custody or com-\nmunity placement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The concurrence\nargues that this sentence makes it clear that the function of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is “to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny transfer\nin the event that it makes one of the four determinations, notwithstanding\nwhat other legal sources might otherwise require.” Conc. Op. at 6532. We\ndo not disagree. The fact that the provision permits the DOC to deny\nrelease even where other legal sources would allow for it is irrelevant,\nhowever, to the question at hand: whether, regardless of other legal\nsources, the statute itself places substantive limits on the DOC’s exercise\nof discretion? As we explain infra, the provision’s preservation to the\nDOC of discretion to deny transfer only “in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations[,]” is precisely the type of substantive limitation\nthat gives rise to the liberty interest that we now recognize.\n   8\n     The final of these criteria is drawn from section 72.09.340(3)(a) of\nWashington’s Revised Code which provides that the DOC is “authorized\nto reject a residence location if the proposed residence is within close\n\f6520                       CARVER v. LEHMAN\nDOC’s policy also provided for the categorical denial of\nrelease plans “if the End of Sentence Review Committee has\ndetermined that the offender appears to meet the definition of\na sexually violent predator and s/he has been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .”9 This final provision, under which Car-\nver’s release plan was denied, was subsequently eliminated\nafter the Washington Court of Appeals held that it violated the\nstatutory requirement that all sex offenders “may become eli-\ngible” for community custody. See In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at\n638-40. See also Letter from Anne L. Fiala, Assistant Deputy\nSecretary, Washington State Dep’t of Corrections, to Office\nof Correctional Operations Management (Jan. 12, 2003).10\n\n   [3] Carver argues that this statutory scheme creates a pro-\ntected liberty interest because it requires the DOC to transfer\n\nproximity to schools, child care centers, playgrounds, or other grounds or\nfacilities where children of similar age or circumstance as a previous vic-\ntim are present who the department determines may be put at substantial\nrisk of harm by the sex offender’s residence at that location.” WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)(a) (2006).\n   9\n     Washington state law defines “sexually violent predator” as “any per-\nson who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence\nand who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which\nmakes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if\nnot confined in a secure facility.” WASH. REV. CODE § 71.09.020(16)\n(2006). An offender determined to be a sexually violent predator may be\nsubject to civil commitment after his term of confinement. WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.040 (2006).\n   10\n      The DOC amended Policy Directive 350.200 in June 2002. In its\namended form, the policy provides for the denial of release plans “[w]hen\nthe offender’s plan is to return to a residence where there is a victim(s)\nthat the [department] believes is at risk[,]” and for the rejection of pro-\nposed residences under the same criteria as set forth in its prior directive.\nSee DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (June 25, 2002). The amended policy\nalso initially retained the provision requiring the categorical denial of the\nrelease plans of those who appear to meet the sexually violent predator\ndefinition and have been referred for civil commitment. Id. As we explain\nsupra, the categorical denial provision was eliminated after the Washing-\nton Court of Appeals’ decision in In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 640.\n\f                         CARVER v. LEHMAN                        6521\nan inmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “un-\nless any one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\nfound[,]” thereby “creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release\n[into community custody] will be granted, and that this in turn\ncreates a legitimate expectation of release absent the requisite\nfinding that one of the justifications for [denial] exists.”\nGreenholtz, 442 U.S. at 11-12. See also Allen, 482 U.S. at\n377-78. We agree.\n\n   [4] The Washington statutory scheme uses language that\neffectively mandates the transfer to community custody of\nthose inmates who have earned release time and who have not\nbeen found to meet one of the statutory reasons for denial of\na release plan set forth in § 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section\n9.94A.710(1) requires that sex offenders be sentenced to a\nterm of community custody to begin either when the offend-\ner’s term of confinement is complete or when he is transferred\nas a result of earned release time. Section 9.94A.728(1) like-\nwise requires the DOC to develop and promulgate procedures\nby which a sex offender may become eligible for transfer to\ncommunity custody in lieu of earned release time. The same\nsection then sets forth the limited circumstances under which\nthe Department “may deny” an inmate’s proposed plan for\ntransfer to community custody. WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d) (listing as legitimate reasons for denial, a\nDOC determination that the release plan may violate the con-\nditions of the sentence or conditions of supervision, place the\noffender at risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, place\nthe offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim or\ncommunity safety). By placing substantive limitations on\nDOC’s discretion to deny release plans and, in particular, by\nrequiring that denial of such plans be based on the limited\ncriteria contained in section 9.94A.728(2)(d), Washington has\ncreated a liberty interest in early release into community cus-\ntody that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.11 See Allen, 482 U.S. at 375-76 (clarifying\n  11\n     At oral argument, Lehman argued that the presence of more specific\ncriteria for denial of proposed residence locations in section\n\f6522                       CARVER v. LEHMAN\nthat a state may grant “significant discretion to the decision-\nmaker” to apply “general or broad release criteria” without\n“depriv[ing] the prisoner of the liberty interest in parole[,]” so\nlong as “release is required after the [decisionmaker] deter-\nmines (in its broad discretion) that the necessary prerequisites\nexist”). See also Baumann, 754 F.2d at 844 (noting that “[a]\nstate may create a constitutionally protected liberty interest by\nestablishing regulatory measures that impose substantive limi-\ntations on the exercise of official discretion”); Bergen v.\n\n72.09.340(3)(a) undermines Carver’s contention that the four criteria listed\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provide the exclusive legitimate bases for\ndenial of a release plan. Lehman is incorrect: the bases for denial of pro-\nposed residence locations contained in section 72.09.340(3)(a) are, in\neffect, specific variations of the same more general formulations set forth\nfor denial of release plans in section 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section\n72.09.340(3)(a) provides:\n       [T]he department shall not approve a residence location if the\n       proposed residence: (i) Includes a minor victim or child of sim-\n       ilar age or circumstance as a previous victim who the depart-\n       ment determines may be put at substantial risk of harm by the\n       offender’s residence in the household; or (ii) is within close\n       proximity of the current residence of a minor victim, unless the\n       whereabouts of the minor victim cannot be determined or\n       unless such a restriction would impede family reunification\n       efforts ordered by the court or directed by the department of\n       social and health services. The department is further authorized\n       to reject a residence location if the proposed residence is\n       within close proximity to schools, child care centers, play-\n       grounds, or other grounds or facilities where children of simi-\n       lar age or circumstance as a previous victim are present who\n       the department determines may be put at substantial risk of\n       harm by the sex offender’s residence at that location.\nThese bases for denial of a proposed residence, which take into account\nwhether the residence includes or is near a past or potential victim, are\nsimply more specific examples of the final two criteria that serve as legiti-\nmate bases for denial under § 9.94A.728(2)(d), whether the “proposed res-\nidence location and living arrangements . . . place the offender at risk to\nreoffend, or present a risk to victim safety or community safety.” WASH.\nREV. CODE § 72.09.340(3)(a).\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                     6523\nSpaulding, 881 F.2d 719, 721 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A board\ncharged with deciding a prisoner’s early release may be dele-\ngated significant discretion in making its decision, and yet be\nconstrained by legal standards in exercising that discretion\n. . . . that scheme may give rise to a liberty interest in early\nrelease.”) (internal citation omitted).\n\n   [5] That the Washington statute governing transfer to com-\nmunity custody does not use the more traditional mandatory\nlanguage formula used in other early release statutes, i.e. stat-\ning that the DOC “shall” grant release “unless” certain find-\nings are made, does not require a contrary result. See Allen,\n482 U.S. at 378 (rejecting the argument that a statute must\ncontain the “shall/unless” formula in order to create a liberty\ninterest). Although we have accorded significance to the use\nof the term “shall” in assessing whether early release statutes\ncreate a liberty interest, we have never held that use of this\nterm is required in order to satisfy the mandatory language\nrule set forth in Greenholtz and Allen. Nor do we here.\nDespite the absence of the word “shall,” we conclude that the\nlanguage of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is mandatory. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) provides that the department “may deny\ntransfer to community custody . . . if” any one of four criteria\nis met. By establishing criteria under which release may be\ndenied, section 9.94A.728(2)(d) creates the presumption that,\nabsent the existence of one those criteria, release will be\ngranted. The repetition of the criteria, albeit in more specific\nform, in section 72.09.340(3)(a) and in Policy Directive\n350.200 confirms our understanding of the mandatory nature\nof the statute.\n\n   The “may deny . . . if” formula operates in precisely the\nsame manner and has precisely the same effect as a “shall\ngrant . . . unless” clause. Under the “may deny . . . if” for-\nmula, the provision sets forth the conditions under which the\nagency may deny release. Otherwise, it must grant it. This is\ndistinguishable from state statutes that provide that a decision-\nmaker “may grant . . . if” certain criteria are met. Under the\n\f6524                         CARVER v. LEHMAN\n“may grant . . . if” formula, the agency may only grant release\nif the relevant criteria are met, but it is not required to do so.12\nTherefore, under the “may deny . . . if” formula, as under a\n“shall grant . . . unless” clause, there is an expectation that\nrelease will be granted unless one of the specified conditions\nexists.\n\n   Our conclusion is supported by Washington state court\ndecisions finding a limited liberty interest in transfer to com-\nmunity custody in lieu of early release, as well as interpreting\nthe statutory provisions governing such transfers. The Wash-\nington Court of Appeals has consistently found a “limited lib-\nerty interest in early release into a community custody\nprogram . . . .” In re Crowder, 985 P.2d at 944-45 (holding\ninmate had liberty interest in grant or denial of community\ncustody placement upon earning of early release, but that the\nminimum level of due process required to protect this interest\nwas provided). See also In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 636 (“An\ninmate’s interest in his earned early release credits is a lim-\nited, but protected, liberty interest.”); In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d\n1227, 1231 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005) (same).13\n  12\n      For this reason, courts have routinely held that the “may grant . . . if”\nformulation does not create a liberty interest. See, e.g., Barna v. Travis,\n239 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 2001) (New York parole statute); Dace v.\nMickelson, 797 F.2d 574, 577 (8th Cir. 1986) (South Dakota parole stat-\nute); Gale v. Moore, 763 F.2d 341, 343 (8th Cir. 1985) (Missouri parole\nstatute); Parker v. Corrothers, 750 F.2d 653, 656-657 (8th Cir. 1984)\n(Arkansas parole statute); Dock v. Latimer, 729 F.2d 1287, 1288 (10th Cir.\n1984) (Utah parole statute); Irving v. Thigpen, 732 F.2d 1215, 1217 (5th\nCir. 1984) (Mississippi parole statute); Candelaria v.

Gilligan, 609 F.2d 866, 867\n(6th Cir. 1979) (Ohio parole statute).\n   13\n      The concurrence contends that we read too much into the use of the\nword “liberty interest” in these cases. It first argues that the liberty interest\n\f                            CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6525\n   Moreover, in interpreting the statutory scheme governing\nearly release into community custody, the state Court of\nAppeals has on two occasions discussed the mandatory nature\nof the law. In Dutcher, an inmate similarly situated to Carver\nchallenged the DOC’s failure to review his plan for release\ninto community custody pursuant to the Department’s policy\nof categorically denying the plans of those offenders who\nappeared to be sexually violent predators and who were\nreferred for civil commitment. 60 P.3d at 635-36. The court\nheld that the DOC’s policy violated the statutory mandate,\nexplaining that “the statute compels DOC to require offenders\nto develop a release plan, and requires DOC to base its com-\n\nrecognized by the Washington Court of Appeals is merely procedural,\nrather than substantive, in nature. Conc. Op. at 6533 (“In both Liptrap and\nDutcher, the Washington court’s holding concerned only the inmate’s pro-\ncedural right to have his proposal considered on the merits, rather than a\nsubstantive right to transfer.”). To the contrary, the Washington court\nexplained: “An inmate’s interest in his earned early release credits is a\nlimited, but protected, liberty interest. Likewise, the department’s compli-\nance with requirements of statutes affecting his release is a protected lib-\nerty interest.” See In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (quoting In re Ducther,\n60 P.3d at 636) (emphasis added). As this language makes clear, the\nWashington court recognizes a liberty interest in both the substantive right\nto earned early release (here, in the form of transfer to community cus-\ntody) and the distinct procedural right to have the DOC comply with the\nrequirements of the statutes governing such release.\n   The concurrence next suggests that “the Washington Court of Appeals\nis using ‘liberty interest’ far more broadly than the term of art of federal\nDue Process jurisprudence . . . encompassing any right cognizable at law\nwith some bearing on whether one receives liberty.” Conc. Op. at 6534\nn.3. That the Washington court had the federal Due Process Clause—and\nnot an ambiguous right otherwise recognized at law—in mind when ana-\nlyzing section 9.94A.728(2) is, again, evidenced by the plain language of\nits decision in Liptrap, where the court framed its discussion of the interest\nat stake in the familiar terms of federal due process jurisprudence. See In\nre Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (explaining that “ “[d]ue process protects\nagainst the deprivation of life, liberty, or property” and finding that “ “[a]n\ninmate’s interest in his earned early release credits is a limited, but pro-\ntected, liberty interest”).\n\f6526                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nmunity custody eligibility decisions on the merits of the\nrelease plan.” 60 P.3d at 638 (emphasis added).\n\n   Our conclusion that requiring a decision on the merits of a\nrelease plan permits the Department to deny such a plan only\nif it finds one of the statutory criteria listed in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is bolstered by the state court’s interpretation\nof the statute in In re Liptrap. In Liptrap, inmates challenged\nthe DOC’s policy of refusing to review release plans of sex\noffenders until a forensic psychological evaluation had been\ncompleted. Id. at 1229. In finding that the Department’s pol-\nicy violated inmates’ due process rights, the court explained\nthat “[t]he provisions in subsections [9.94A.728(2)] (c) and\n(d), spell[ ] out what is required in a release plan and stat[e]\nreasons why the department may deny a release[.]” Id. at\n1232 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Liptrap court found\nthat “the department [does not have] unlimited discretion to\ndecide whether and when to consider an offender for transfer\nto community custody.” Id. Rather, the DOC’s failure to\n“state[ ] a legitimate reason” for the denial of a release plan,\nthe court concluded, “deprived [the inmates] of earned early\nrelease credits in violation of due process.” Id. at 1234\n(emphasis added).14 This holding is consistent with our con-\nclusion that Washington law requires that the DOC’s denial\nof a release plan be based on a “legitimate reason,” and that\nsuch reasons are enumerated in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   [6] In sum, we hold that the Washington statutory scheme\ngoverning transfer to community custody of those inmates\nwho have earned early release time creates a liberty interest\nthat is protected under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\n  14\n     The Liptrap court specifically noted section 72.09.340’s provision for\ndenial of a release plan because the proposed residence is near young chil-\ndren as a “legitimate statutory reason for disapproving a release plan for\na sex offender.” In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1233 & n.6 (citing WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)). For the reasons set forth in footnote 11 supra, this\nprovision is simply a specific example of the more general bases for denial\nset forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                            6527\nteenth Amendment.15 Our next step is to determine “whether\n   15\n      We acknowledge that our holding is inconsistent with two non-\nprecedential dispositions of this court, as well as the unpublished decisions\nof several federal district courts that have addressed this question. See\nDutcher v. Lehman, No. 06-35043, 2007 WL 1742794 (9th Cir. June 14,\n2007); Chaney v. Lehman, No. 05-36116, 2007 WL 870358 (9th Cir. Mar.\n22, 2007); Duncan v. Lehman, No. C04-5633RBL, 2006 WL 1548820\n(W.D. Wash. June 2, 2006); Garcia v. Lehman, No. C04-5893FDB, 2006\nWL 827957 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 23, 2006). The district court dispositions\nare in no way binding and, for the reasons set forth above, we do not\nbelieve that they reach the correct result.\n   The contrary dispositions of our own court do give us pause, although\nwhen the panel involved deliberately chooses to make its views non-\nprecedential we would be disregarding our duty to exercise our indepen-\ndent judgment if we treated those views as controlling on the court. See\n9TH CIR. R. 36-3. Still we examine the less formal views of our colleagues\nwith some deference, while bearing in mind the ultimate status our col-\nleagues have chosen to have us and all future panels afford those views.\nIn Chaney, one of the two non-precedential dispositions filed by our col-\nleagues, Washington inmates held beyond the date that they were or would\nbe eligible for release into community custody appealed the denial of their\nrelease without a prior hearing. 2007 WL 870358, at *1. In affirming the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of their section 1983 claim, the Chaney panel\nreached two alternative holdings. One, with only the cursory observation\nthat “[t]he Washington statute grants a significant degree of discretion to\nthe DOC[,]” the panel found that state law did not create a liberty interest\nin release into community custody. Id. However, as the Supreme Court\nexplained in Allen, “the presence of general or broad release criteria—\ndelegating significant discretion to the decisionmaker . . . . is not incom-\npatible with the existence of a liberty interest.” Allen, 482 U.S. at 375-76\n(emphasis added). Two, acknowledging that Washington state courts have\nfound a limited liberty interest, the panel concluded that even assuming\nthe existence of such an interest, the process demanded by the Chaney\nplaintiffs—a hearing—was not required. 2007 WL 870358, at *2. In the\npresent case, Carver argues only that he was entitled to some form of pro-\ncess before his release plan was summarily rejected, not that he was enti-\ntled to a full hearing. Thus, the alternative Chaney holding is in no way\ninconsistent with the conclusion we reach here. In Dutcher, the second of\nthe two non-precedential dispositions, the panel’s conclusion that Wash-\nington law does not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity placement was supported only by a citation to Greenholtz. Dutcher,\n2007 WL 1742794, at *1. For the reasons set forth above, we believe that\nGreenholtz supports the existence of a liberty interest. The Dutcher\npanel’s failure to provide any reasoning in its disposition makes it impos-\nsible for us to address the merits of its conclusion to the contrary.\n\f6528                    CARVER v. LEHMAN\nthe procedures attendant upon th[e] deprivation [of Carver’s\nliberty interest] were constitutionally sufficient[.]” Thompson,\n490 U.S. at 460. Carver’s release plan was denied under a cat-\negorical policy that provided him with no process at all; it\nsimply rejected all plans of offenders who, like Carver,\nappeared to fall under the definition of a sexually violent\npredator and who were referred for civil commitment.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the complete absence of proce-\ndures deprived Carver of his liberty interest in transfer to\ncommunity custody without due process of law.\n\n                   B.   Qualified Immunity\n\n   [7] Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . .\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Our qualified immunity\nanalysis proceeds in two parts. First, we consider whether\n“the facts alleged show that [Lehman’s] conduct violated a\nconstitutional right[.]” Galen, 477 F.3d at 658-59 (citing Sau-\ncier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-02 (2001)). For the reasons\ndiscussed above, we answer this question in the affirmative.\nSecond, we ask if “the right [Lehman is] alleged to have vio-\nlated [was] clearly established such that a reasonable [official]\nwould have understood that he was violating that right[.]” Id.\nWe conclude that the answer to this question is no.\n\n   [8] In determining whether the right alleged to have been\nviolated was clearly established, we must consider the right\n“in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad\ngeneral proposition[.]” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “ ‘The con-\ntours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that\nright.’ ” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). Here, because section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) does not use the more common mandatory\nterm “shall,” a reasonable correctional official might not have\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                     6529\nunderstood that the Washington statutory scheme created a\nliberty interest in early release into community custody. Cer-\ntainly, the question was highly debatable at the time that Leh-\nman was required to act. Carver’s plan was denied before the\nWashington Court of Appeals had issued its decisions in Dut-\ncher and Liptrap, which clarified that not only does a limited\nliberty interest exist under state law, but that the DOC’s dis-\ncretion to deny release into community custody is limited to\nrejection of a plan on the basis of the legitimate statutory\ncriteria set forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   [9] Because we conclude that the right at issue here was not\nsufficiently clear at the time of the facts giving rise to this\ncase such that a reasonable official would understand that\ndenying a release plan without providing a legitimate statu-\ntory reason for that denial would violate due process, we\naffirm the district court’s grant of qualified immunity.\n\n                       III.   Conclusion\n\n   Washington state law creates a liberty interest in an\ninmate’s early release into community custody that is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Carver was denied his due process right by the\nstate officials’ refusal to approve his release plan without\nreviewing it on its merits. At the time, however, the due pro-\ncess right arising from the existence of his liberty interest was\nnot sufficiently clearly established to meet the Saucier stan-\ndard. We therefore affirm the district court’s determination\nthat Lehman is entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nMILAN D. SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring in the\njudgment:\n\n   I respectfully part ways with the majority. I do not believe\nthat Washington State law creates a Fourteenth Amendment\n\f6530                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nliberty interest in early release into community custody. The\nmajority erroneously conjures a statutory liberty interest, pro-\ntected by the Due Process Clause, out of Wash. Rev. Code\n§ 9.94A.728(2) only by confusing “may” and “shall” and by\nreading “if” to mean “only if.”\n\n                               I.\n\n   “The preeminent canon of statutory construction requires\nus to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it\nmeans and means in a statute what it says there.” BedRoc Ltd.\nv. United States, 541 U.S. 176, 183 (2004) (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted). Far from using “the more tra-\nditional mandatory language formula used in other early\nrelease statutes,” Maj. Op. at 6523, section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\ninstead uses traditional permissive “may . . . if” language used\nin statutes that create no liberty interest. Had the Washington\nState Legislature meant to write a statute limiting the discre-\ntion of the DOC, it could easily have said so. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) states that the DOC “may deny” convicted\nsex offenders transfer to community custody “if” it makes\ncertain determinations about the offender’s proposed release\nplan. It says nothing about the criteria for granting the\nrequest, let alone detailing circumstances under which the\nDOC must do so.\n\n   The majority overcomes the legislature’s failure to specify\nany criteria for granting a request by holding that the determi-\nnations mentioned in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are the only\nconditions on which the DOC may deny transfer, and there-\nfore requiring that it grant in all other cases. Maj. Op. at\n6523-24. One searches the statute in vain, however, for any\nindication that those determinations are the exclusive reasons\nthat the DOC “may deny” transfer. The criteria of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) are sufficient to deny sex offenders transfer,\nbut are not necessary. Had the legislature wished to make\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                            6531\nthem necessary, it would have used not “if” but “only if,” or\nsome semantic equivalent.1\n\n   In some cases, a court may read the word “if” to mean\n“only if.” The canon of construction expressio unius est exclu-\nsio alterius stands for the proposition that, when the legisla-\nture provides a list of related items, it impliedly means to\nexclude other items. See Norman J. Singer, 2A Sutherland\nStatutes and Statutory Construction § 47:23 (7th Ed. 2007).\nSuch a result obtains, however, only where there is some rea-\nson to believe that the legislature intended that the enumera-\ntion be exclusive—or at the very least in the absence of\nevidence to the contrary. “The maxim expressio unius est\nexclusio alterius is an aid to construction, not a rule of law.\nIt can never override clear and contrary evidences of [legisla-\ntive] intent.” Neuberger v. Comm’r, 311 U.S. 83, 88 (1940);\nsee also Wash. State Labor Council v. Reed, 65 P.3d 1203,\n1209 (Wash. 2003) (“[T]he rule of expressio unius est exclu-\nsio alterius d[oes] not necessarily apply without considering\n  1\n    It is true that there are no magic words necessary for the legislature to\ncreate a liberty interest. Bd. of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 378 (1987).\nThere are any number of other ways the legislature might have accom-\nplished the result the majority reads into section 9.94A.728(2)(d). It might\nhave said the DOC “shall” grant release “unless” the criteria are met or\n“if” they are not; it might have said that it “may” deny release “only if”\nthe criteria are met, or “except in the event” they are not; it might have\ncome up with another formulation that means substantially the same thing.\n   The distinction between “if” and “only if,” however, is not a mere quib-\nble over vocabulary—it goes right to the heart of whether the criteria of\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d) are necessary or sufficient conditions for transfer,\nand therefore whether transfer is mandatory or entirely discretionary.\n“May . . . only if” would be effectively identical to “shall . . . unless ”;\n“may . . . if” is not. Contra Maj. Op. at 6523-24. In formal terms, the\nmajority commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent: from the premise\n“if P, then Q,” it does not follow from “not P” that “not Q.” See generally\nRuggero J. Aldisert, Logic for Lawyers 160-61 (3d ed. 1997); Bruce N.\nWaller, Critical Thinking 112-13 (5th ed. 2005); Wikipedia, Denying the\nantecedent, available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_\nantecedent (Last accessed May 30, 2008).\n\f6532                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nother factors which may persuade the court that legislative\nintent was the opposite of what the statutory construction rule\nwould require.”). In this case, however, the majority uses the\ntechnique sub silentio to override the unambiguously discre-\ntionary language in the statute (“may”).\n\n   The language of Wash. Rev. Code section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\nmakes it clear that the provision’s purpose is to expand the\ndiscretion of the DOC. This makes the majority’s implicit\nexpressio unius reading especially inappropriate. The statute\nstates: “The department’s authority under this section is inde-\npendent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or statu-\ntory provision regarding conditions for community custody or\ncommunity placement.” Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.728(2)(d).\nThat language makes the function of section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\napparent: to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny trans-\nfer in the event that it makes one of the four determinations,\nnotwithstanding what other legal sources might otherwise\nrequire. The majority’s reading of the statute, however, turns\nthat meaning on its head, transmuting a non obstante provi-\nsion written to preserve or expand discretion into one with the\neffect of limiting it.\n\n                              II.\n\n   I might still concur with this misreading of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d), however, if the Washington State courts had\nsimilarly misread the statute. See Bergen v. Spaulding, 881\nF.2d 719, 721 (9th Cir.1989) (“Whether a state statute pro-\nvides such a protectable entitlement depends on the structure\nand language of the statute, as well as the state courts’ inter-\npretation of the scope of the interest.”) (emphasis added). But,\nnotwithstanding the majority’s characterization of state prece-\ndent, they have not.\n\n   The majority quotes language from Washington intermedi-\nate appellate courts recognizing a “limited liberty interest” in\nearly release. Maj. Op. at 6524 (quoting In re Liptrap, 111\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                           6533\nP.3d 1227, 1231 (Wash. Ct.

What the majority\nomits is the nature of that state “liberty interest.” In both Lip-\ntrap and Dutcher, the Washington court’s holding concerned\nonly the inmate’s procedural right to have his proposal con-\nsidered on the merits, rather than a substantive right to transfer.2\nLiptrap, 111 P.3d at 1234; Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 638. This was\nbased, in large part, on the only truly mandatory language\nfound in section 9.94A.728(2), mandating that the DOC “shall\n. . . require the offender to propose a release plan.” Wash.\nRev. Code § 9.94A.728(2)(c); see Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 638.\nUnfortunately, “expectation of receiving process is not, with-\nout more, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process\nClause” of the Fourteenth Amendment. Olim v. Wakinekona,\n461 U.S. 238, 250-51 n.12 (1983); see also In re Cashaw, 866\nP.2d 8, 12 (Wash. 1994) (“The United States Supreme Court\nand the Ninth Circuit have clearly held that procedural laws\ndo not create liberty interests; only substantive laws can\ncreate these interests.”). Washington State law permits prison-\ners to challenge DOC violations of parole procedures, but it\ngrounds this right to process in state law, not in the federal con-\nstitution.3 While the DOC has, therefore, no “discretion to\n  2\n     Crowder, decided in 1999, predated the 2002 enactment of the statute\nsupposedly creating the liberty interest at issue in this case. Liptrap, 111\nP.3d at 1232 & n.3.\n   3\n     See Cashaw, 866 P.2d 8, 13 (Wash. 1994) (“The Court of Appeals was\ncorrect in concluding the Board had violated its own procedural rules for\nparolability hearings . . . . Where the Court of Appeals erred was in taking\nthe additional step of concluding this violation was of constitutional mag-\nnitude.”). Cashaw instead held that the inmate’s right to challenge his\nrestraint because of procedural error is grounded in Washington Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 16.4. Id. at 13-14. Notwithstanding the holding of\nCashaw, Dutcher refers to an inmate’s “protected liberty interest” in “the\ndepartment’s compliance with requirements of statute affecting his\nrelease,” citing Cashaw itself for the proposition. 60 P.3d at 636 & n.3\n(citing Cashaw, 866 P.2d at 11).\n  As the majority notes, Dutcher “recognizes a liberty interest in both the\nsubstantive right to early release . . .and the distinct procedural right to\n\f6534                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\ndecide whether or when to consider an offender for transfer\nto community custody,” Liptrap, 60 P.3d at 638 (emphasis\nadded), Washington’s courts have given no indication that its\ndiscretion is substantially limited in how it makes that consid-\neration.\n\n   None of the cases cited by the majority implies that the\ncriteria in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are the exclusive reasons\nthat the DOC may deny transfer to community custody. Lip-\ntrap notes that the statute “stat[es] reasons why the depart-\nment may deny a release plan,” 111 P.3d at 1232, but those\n“reasons” are kept in the indefinite: they are just “reasons”—\nnot the reasons, let alone the only reasons—for denial. Simi-\nlarly, Dutcher held that “the statute . . . requires DOC to base\nits community custody eligibility decisions on the merits of\nthe release plan,” 60 P.3d at 638, but does not imply that sec-\ntion 9.94A.728(2)(d) provides the sole rubric by which those\n“merits” are to be evaluated.\n\nhave the DOC comply with the requirements of the statutes governing\nsuch release.” Maj. Op. at 6524-25 n.13 (emphasis added). Because Dut-\ncher’s holding concerns only the latter, procedural right, its description of\nthe former can only be described as dicta. As with much dicta, it risks\nimprecision, using the same term, “liberty interest,” to refer both to the\nsubstantive interest in transfer, which could conceivably be a Fourteenth\nAmendment “liberty interest,” and the procedural right to compliance with\nregulation, which cannot. If a chef announces that the dessert will consist\nof “fruit,” but in the very next breath lists “herring” and “quartz” as other\nkinds of “fruit,” one might be forgiven in beginning to doubt that the\ndish’s ingredients have necessarily been plucked off a tree.\n   Notwithstanding its use of traditional Due Process Clause terminology\nand concepts, therefore, the only charitable reading of Dutcher, not\nsquarely foreclosed by both United States and Washington State Supreme\nCourt precedent, is that the Washington Court of Appeals is using “liberty\ninterest” far more broadly than the term of art of federal Due Process juris-\nprudence that the majority contemplates, encompassing any right cogniza-\nble at law with some bearing on whether one receives liberty. No other\nreading is possible in light of precedent that has held that a right to process\nis no more a Fourteenth Amendment “liberty interest” than a herring is a\nfruit. Olim, 461 U.S. at 250-51 n.12; Cashaw, 866 P.2d at 12.\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                         6535\n   Washington courts have implied only one limit on the sub-\nstance of the DOC’s exercise of discretion: its reasons for\ndenial must be “legitimate.” Id. But contrary to the majority’s\nassertions, there is no indication that a reason may acquire\n“legitimacy” only by its enumeration in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d). Indeed, there is every indication to the con-\ntrary: it was Crowder, a decision predating the enactment of\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d) by three years, that first mentioned\n“legitimate reasons” for denial of community custody. 985\nP.2d at 946. Moreover, Crowder specified the petitioner’s\n“own withdrawal of a suggested placement plan” as among\nthe “legitimate reasons” for denying him transfer, id.—a rea-\nson which certainly seems legitimate, but appears nowhere in\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d). Neither Dutcher nor Liptrap hint\nthat subsequent codification of certain legitimate reasons has\nsomehow narrowed the range of legitimacy, and no Washing-\nton case has provided a general definition for what makes a\nreason “legitimate,” which could be as broad as “any reason\nnot otherwise proscribed by law.”4 This ill-defined “right” to\ntransfer only in the absence of some “legitimate” reason to\ndeny is hardly sufficient to produce the “legitimate expecta-\ntion of release” required of a protected liberty interest under\nGreenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Corr. Com-\nplex, 442 U.S. 1, 12 (1979). Washington case law, in short,\nprovides no reason for us to disregard the text and manifest\npurpose of section 9.94A.728(2).\n\n                            *      *       *\n\n   For the reasons set forth above, I would join the two district\ncourts and two panels of this court, see Maj. Op. at 6526 n.14,\nthat have all held that section 9.94A.728(2) does not create a\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. I would therefore not reach the issue\n  4\n    Under such a reading, the DOC, for example, could not deny transfer\nto someone on account of his race or religion. Such a condition may limit\nthe DOC’s discretion, but scarcely enough to give rise to any “expecta-\ntion” of transfer.\n\f6536                CARVER v.

LEHMAN\n                              OPINION\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case presents the question whether Washington state\nlaw creates a liberty interest in an inmate’s early release into\ncommunity custody that is protected under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it does.\nWe conclude, however, that this right was not clearly estab-\nlished at the time of the facts giving rise to this case. We\ntherefore affirm the district court’s grant of qualified immu-\nnity.\n\n          I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n   In August 1999, Joseph Dale Carver pled guilty to child\nmolestation in the third degree. He was sentenced to fifty-four\nmonths of confinement in the custody of the Washington\nState Department of Corrections (“DOC” or “Department”).\nBecause he was a sex offender, state law also required that\nCarver be sentenced to a term of community custody to begin\n“either upon completion of the term of confinement or at such\ntime as [he] is transferred to community custody in lieu of\nearned release[.]” See WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.710(1)\n(2006).1 He was sentenced to a thirty-six-month period of\ncommunity custody.\n  1\n    The Washington Court of Appeals has explained that “[c]ommunity\ncustody is the intense monitoring of an offender in the community for a\nperiod of at least one year after release or transfer from confinement.\nAlthough it has other purposes, community custody continues in the\nnature of punishment, and is not equivalent to general release.” In re\nCrowder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264817\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264817/in-re-crowder/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999). Offenders in commu-\nnity custody live in a residence pre-approved by the DOC and are subject\nto mandatory and discretionary conditions imposed by either the DOC or\nthe sentencing court. See, e.g., WASH. REV. CODE §§ 9.94A.710(2)-(3),\n9.94A.700(4)-(5) (listing mandatory and discretionary conditions imposed\non offenders subject to community custody including, inter alia, reporting\nrequirements, payment of supervision fees, and prohibitions against pos-\nsession of controlled substances and consumption of alcohol).\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6515\n   Carver’s good behavior as a prisoner earned him an early\nrelease date of June 27, 2002.2 Carver’s sex offense, however,\nprecluded him from being released on his earned date. WASH.\nREV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(a) (2006). Rather, state law pro-\nvides that sex offenders may become eligible for transfer to\ncommunity custody in lieu of early release. Id. Eligibility for\ntransfer to community custody is determined based on “re-\nlease plan[s]” submitted by offenders. WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(c). In March 2002, Carver submitted a release\nplan. His plan was denied in April 2002, pursuant to a DOC\npolicy then in effect which provided for the categorical denial\nof release plans of offenders, like Carver, whom the Depart-\nment determined “appear[ed] to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and [who had] been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .” DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (May 4,\n2001).3 As a result of the denial of his proposed release plan,\nCarver served his full term of confinement.\n\n   In September 2004, Carver filed a civil rights suit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, asserting that DOC officials denied him early\nrelease into community custody without affording him due\nprocess of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.4 The district\ncourt, adopting the report and recommendation of the magis-\ntrate judge, granted the DOC officials’ motion for summary\njudgment on two principal grounds: one, that Washington law\ndoes not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity custody and therefore Carver did not have a due process\n  2\n     For reasons that are not explained in the record before us, this date was\nsubsequently pushed back to January 13, 2003.\n   3\n     As we explain infra, this policy was subsequently struck down by the\nWashington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580928/in-re-dutcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (Wash.\nCt. App. 2002) (holding “DOC Policy 350.200 . . . violates the governing\nstatutes”).\n   4\n     Carver’s original complaint named as a defendant only Joseph Leh-\nman, secretary of the DOC at the time that Carver’s release plan was\ndenied. In his amended complaint, Carver named two additional defen-\ndants, Kimberley Acker and Victoria Roberts, both DOC officials\ninvolved in making end of sentence review determinations.\n\f6516                     CARVER v.

See also Sass, 461 F.3d at 1127 n.3 (explaining that this\ncourt has “consistently rejected th[e] argument” that Sandin eliminated the\n“ ‘mandatory language’ approach of Greenholtz and Allen). Accordingly,\nwe continue to apply the “mandatory language” rule set forth in Green-\nholtz and Allen in order to determine whether Washington’s statutory\nscheme creates a liberty interest in early release into community custody.\n\f6518                    CARVER v. LEHMAN\n461, 469-70 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding Idaho law does not\ncreate a liberty interest in parole). We turn to that task now.\n\n A.    The Washington statutory scheme governing early\n           release into community custody creates a\n           constitutionally protected liberty interest.\n\n   Washington law mandates that an individual convicted of\na sex offense be sentenced to a term of community custody\nthat “shall begin either upon completion of the term of con-\nfinement or at such time as the offender is transferred to com-\nmunity custody in lieu of earned release.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.710(1). Unlike other inmates, then, a convicted sex\noffender who accrues “earned release time . . . for good\nbehavior and good performance” is not entitled to early\nrelease; rather, he is eligible for transfer into community cus-\ntody at an earlier date. WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(1),\n(2)(a). The law requires the DOC to develop a program to\neffectuate the transfer to community custody of such inmates.\nSee WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(1). As part of that pro-\ngram, the Department must “require the offender to propose\na release plan that includes an approved residence and living\narrangement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(c). The law\nthen describes how the DOC should evaluate such release\nplans, stating:\n\n      The department may deny transfer to community\n      custody status in lieu of earned release time pursuant\n      to subsection (1) of this section if the department\n      determines an offender’s release plan, including pro-\n      posed residence location and living arrangements,\n      [1] may violate the conditions of the sentence or\n      conditions of supervision, [2] place the offender at\n      risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, [3]\n      place the offender at risk to reoffend, or [4] present\n      a risk to victim safety or community safety.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6519\nWASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (emphasis added).7\n\n   In order to comply with the statutory mandate, the DOC\npromulgated Policy Directive 350.200. Under the version of\nthis policy in force when Carver submitted his release plan,\nthe DOC instructed that release plans of sex offenders be\nassessed to determine “the degree of risk for victims and\npotential victims of similar age or circumstances” and to\nensure that, subject to certain exceptions, “[s]ex offenders will\nnot return to a residence where minor victim(s) or other chil-\ndren of similar age are present in the residence[.]” DOC Pol-\nicy Directive 350.200 (May 4, 2001). The Policy Directive\nspecified that a residence proposed by an offender within a\nrelease plan may be denied if the proposed location will place\nthe offender in violation of court-imposed conditions, at the\nlikely risk to re-offend, or in close proximity to the minor vic-\ntim(s), school, child care center, playground, or other facilities\nwhere children of similar age and circumstances surrounding\nthe conviction are present and who may be put at substantial\nrisk of harm by the offender residing at that location.8 The\n  7\n     The provision goes on to state that “[t]he department’s authority under\nthis section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\nstatutory provision regarding conditions for community custody or com-\nmunity placement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The concurrence\nargues that this sentence makes it clear that the function of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is “to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny transfer\nin the event that it makes one of the four determinations, notwithstanding\nwhat other legal sources might otherwise require.” Conc. Op. at 6532. We\ndo not disagree. The fact that the provision permits the DOC to deny\nrelease even where other legal sources would allow for it is irrelevant,\nhowever, to the question at hand: whether, regardless of other legal\nsources, the statute itself places substantive limits on the DOC’s exercise\nof discretion? As we explain infra, the provision’s preservation to the\nDOC of discretion to deny transfer only “in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations[,]” is precisely the type of substantive limitation\nthat gives rise to the liberty interest that we now recognize.\n   8\n     The final of these criteria is drawn from section 72.09.340(3)(a) of\nWashington’s Revised Code which provides that the DOC is “authorized\nto reject a residence location if the proposed residence is within close\n\f6520                       CARVER v. LEHMAN\nDOC’s policy also provided for the categorical denial of\nrelease plans “if the End of Sentence Review Committee has\ndetermined that the offender appears to meet the definition of\na sexually violent predator and s/he has been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .”9 This final provision, under which Car-\nver’s release plan was denied, was subsequently eliminated\nafter the Washington Court of Appeals held that it violated the\nstatutory requirement that all sex offenders “may become eli-\ngible” for community custody. See In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at\n638-40. See also Letter from Anne L. Fiala, Assistant Deputy\nSecretary, Washington State Dep’t of Corrections, to Office\nof Correctional Operations Management (Jan. 12, 2003).10\n\n   [3] Carver argues that this statutory scheme creates a pro-\ntected liberty interest because it requires the DOC to transfer\n\nproximity to schools, child care centers, playgrounds, or other grounds or\nfacilities where children of similar age or circumstance as a previous vic-\ntim are present who the department determines may be put at substantial\nrisk of harm by the sex offender’s residence at that location.” WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)(a) (2006).\n   9\n     Washington state law defines “sexually violent predator” as “any per-\nson who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence\nand who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which\nmakes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if\nnot confined in a secure facility.” WASH. REV. CODE § 71.09.020(16)\n(2006). An offender determined to be a sexually violent predator may be\nsubject to civil commitment after his term of confinement. WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.040 (2006).\n   10\n      The DOC amended Policy Directive 350.200 in June 2002. In its\namended form, the policy provides for the denial of release plans “[w]hen\nthe offender’s plan is to return to a residence where there is a victim(s)\nthat the [department] believes is at risk[,]” and for the rejection of pro-\nposed residences under the same criteria as set forth in its prior directive.\nSee DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (June 25, 2002). The amended policy\nalso initially retained the provision requiring the categorical denial of the\nrelease plans of those who appear to meet the sexually violent predator\ndefinition and have been referred for civil commitment. Id. As we explain\nsupra, the categorical denial provision was eliminated after the Washing-\nton Court of Appeals’ decision in In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 640.\n\f                         CARVER v. LEHMAN                        6521\nan inmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “un-\nless any one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\nfound[,]” thereby “creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release\n[into community custody] will be granted, and that this in turn\ncreates a legitimate expectation of release absent the requisite\nfinding that one of the justifications for [denial] exists.”\nGreenholtz, 442 U.S. at 11-12. See also Allen, 482 U.S. at\n377-78. We agree.\n\n   [4] The Washington statutory scheme uses language that\neffectively mandates the transfer to community custody of\nthose inmates who have earned release time and who have not\nbeen found to meet one of the statutory reasons for denial of\na release plan set forth in § 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section\n9.94A.710(1) requires that sex offenders be sentenced to a\nterm of community custody to begin either when the offend-\ner’s term of confinement is complete or when he is transferred\nas a result of earned release time. Section 9.94A.728(1) like-\nwise requires the DOC to develop and promulgate procedures\nby which a sex offender may become eligible for transfer to\ncommunity custody in lieu of earned release time. The same\nsection then sets forth the limited circumstances under which\nthe Department “may deny” an inmate’s proposed plan for\ntransfer to community custody. WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d) (listing as legitimate reasons for denial, a\nDOC determination that the release plan may violate the con-\nditions of the sentence or conditions of supervision, place the\noffender at risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, place\nthe offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim or\ncommunity safety). By placing substantive limitations on\nDOC’s discretion to deny release plans and, in particular, by\nrequiring that denial of such plans be based on the limited\ncriteria contained in section 9.94A.728(2)(d), Washington has\ncreated a liberty interest in early release into community cus-\ntody that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.11 See Allen, 482 U.S. at 375-76 (clarifying\n  11\n     At oral argument, Lehman argued that the presence of more specific\ncriteria for denial of proposed residence locations in section\n\f6522                       CARVER v. LEHMAN\nthat a state may grant “significant discretion to the decision-\nmaker” to apply “general or broad release criteria” without\n“depriv[ing] the prisoner of the liberty interest in parole[,]” so\nlong as “release is required after the [decisionmaker] deter-\nmines (in its broad discretion) that the necessary prerequisites\nexist”). See also Baumann, 754 F.2d at 844 (noting that “[a]\nstate may create a constitutionally protected liberty interest by\nestablishing regulatory measures that impose substantive limi-\ntations on the exercise of official discretion”); Bergen v.\n\n72.09.340(3)(a) undermines Carver’s contention that the four criteria listed\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provide the exclusive legitimate bases for\ndenial of a release plan. Lehman is incorrect: the bases for denial of pro-\nposed residence locations contained in section 72.09.340(3)(a) are, in\neffect, specific variations of the same more general formulations set forth\nfor denial of release plans in section 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section\n72.09.340(3)(a) provides:\n       [T]he department shall not approve a residence location if the\n       proposed residence: (i) Includes a minor victim or child of sim-\n       ilar age or circumstance as a previous victim who the depart-\n       ment determines may be put at substantial risk of harm by the\n       offender’s residence in the household; or (ii) is within close\n       proximity of the current residence of a minor victim, unless the\n       whereabouts of the minor victim cannot be determined or\n       unless such a restriction would impede family reunification\n       efforts ordered by the court or directed by the department of\n       social and health services. The department is further authorized\n       to reject a residence location if the proposed residence is\n       within close proximity to schools, child care centers, play-\n       grounds, or other grounds or facilities where children of simi-\n       lar age or circumstance as a previous victim are present who\n       the department determines may be put at substantial risk of\n       harm by the sex offender’s residence at that location.\nThese bases for denial of a proposed residence, which take into account\nwhether the residence includes or is near a past or potential victim, are\nsimply more specific examples of the final two criteria that serve as legiti-\nmate bases for denial under § 9.94A.728(2)(d), whether the “proposed res-\nidence location and living arrangements . . . place the offender at risk to\nreoffend, or present a risk to victim safety or community safety.” WASH.\nREV. CODE § 72.09.340(3)(a).\n\f                       CARVER v.

See Allen,\n482 U.S. at 378 (rejecting the argument that a statute must\ncontain the “shall/unless” formula in order to create a liberty\ninterest). Although we have accorded significance to the use\nof the term “shall” in assessing whether early release statutes\ncreate a liberty interest, we have never held that use of this\nterm is required in order to satisfy the mandatory language\nrule set forth in Greenholtz and Allen. Nor do we here.\nDespite the absence of the word “shall,” we conclude that the\nlanguage of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is mandatory. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) provides that the department “may deny\ntransfer to community custody . . . if” any one of four criteria\nis met. By establishing criteria under which release may be\ndenied, section 9.94A.728(2)(d) creates the presumption that,\nabsent the existence of one those criteria, release will be\ngranted. The repetition of the criteria, albeit in more specific\nform, in section 72.09.340(3)(a) and in Policy Directive\n350.200 confirms our understanding of the mandatory nature\nof the statute.\n\n   The “may deny . . . if” formula operates in precisely the\nsame manner and has precisely the same effect as a “shall\ngrant . . . unless” clause. Under the “may deny . . . if” for-\nmula, the provision sets forth the conditions under which the\nagency may deny release. Otherwise, it must grant it. This is\ndistinguishable from state statutes that provide that a decision-\nmaker “may grant . . . if” certain criteria are met. Under the\n\f6524                         CARVER v. LEHMAN\n“may grant . . . if” formula, the agency may only grant release\nif the relevant criteria are met, but it is not required to do so.12\nTherefore, under the “may deny . . . if” formula, as under a\n“shall grant . . . unless” clause, there is an expectation that\nrelease will be granted unless one of the specified conditions\nexists.\n\n   Our conclusion is supported by Washington state court\ndecisions finding a limited liberty interest in transfer to com-\nmunity custody in lieu of early release, as well as interpreting\nthe statutory provisions governing such transfers. The Wash-\nington Court of Appeals has consistently found a “limited lib-\nerty interest in early release into a community custody\nprogram . . . .” In re Crowder, 985 P.2d at 944-45 (holding\ninmate had liberty interest in grant or denial of community\ncustody placement upon earning of early release, but that the\nminimum level of due process required to protect this interest\nwas provided).

It first argues that the liberty interest\n\f                            CARVER v. LEHMAN                             6525\n   Moreover, in interpreting the statutory scheme governing\nearly release into community custody, the state Court of\nAppeals has on two occasions discussed the mandatory nature\nof the law. In Dutcher, an inmate similarly situated to Carver\nchallenged the DOC’s failure to review his plan for release\ninto community custody pursuant to the Department’s policy\nof categorically denying the plans of those offenders who\nappeared to be sexually violent predators and who were\nreferred for civil commitment. 60 P.3d at 635-36. The court\nheld that the DOC’s policy violated the statutory mandate,\nexplaining that “the statute compels DOC to require offenders\nto develop a release plan, and requires DOC to base its com-\n\nrecognized by the Washington Court of Appeals is merely procedural,\nrather than substantive, in nature. Conc. Op. at 6533 (“In both Liptrap and\nDutcher, the Washington court’s holding concerned only the inmate’s pro-\ncedural right to have his proposal considered on the merits, rather than a\nsubstantive right to transfer.”). To the contrary, the Washington court\nexplained: “An inmate’s interest in his earned early release credits is a\nlimited, but protected, liberty interest. Likewise, the department’s compli-\nance with requirements of statutes affecting his release is a protected lib-\nerty interest.” See In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (quoting In re Ducther,\n60 P.3d at 636) (emphasis added). As this language makes clear, the\nWashington court recognizes a liberty interest in both the substantive right\nto earned early release (here, in the form of transfer to community cus-\ntody) and the distinct procedural right to have the DOC comply with the\nrequirements of the statutes governing such release.\n   The concurrence next suggests that “the Washington Court of Appeals\nis using ‘liberty interest’ far more broadly than the term of art of federal\nDue Process jurisprudence . . . encompassing any right cognizable at law\nwith some bearing on whether one receives liberty.” Conc. Op. at 6534\nn.3. That the Washington court had the federal Due Process Clause—and\nnot an ambiguous right otherwise recognized at law—in mind when ana-\nlyzing section 9.94A.728(2) is, again, evidenced by the plain language of\nits decision in Liptrap, where the court framed its discussion of the interest\nat stake in the familiar terms of federal due process jurisprudence. See In\nre Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (explaining that “ “[d]ue process protects\nagainst the deprivation of life, liberty, or property” and finding that “ “[a]n\ninmate’s interest in his earned early release credits is a limited, but pro-\ntected, liberty interest”).\n\f6526                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nmunity custody eligibility decisions on the merits of the\nrelease plan.” 60 P.3d at 638 (emphasis added).\n\n   Our conclusion that requiring a decision on the merits of a\nrelease plan permits the Department to deny such a plan only\nif it finds one of the statutory criteria listed in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is bolstered by the state court’s interpretation\nof the statute in In re Liptrap. In Liptrap, inmates challenged\nthe DOC’s policy of refusing to review release plans of sex\noffenders until a forensic psychological evaluation had been\ncompleted. Id. at 1229. In finding that the Department’s pol-\nicy violated inmates’ due process rights, the court explained\nthat “[t]he provisions in subsections [9.94A.728(2)] (c) and\n(d), spell[ ] out what is required in a release plan and stat[e]\nreasons why the department may deny a release[.]” Id. at\n1232 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Liptrap court found\nthat “the department [does not have] unlimited discretion to\ndecide whether and when to consider an offender for transfer\nto community custody.” Id. Rather, the DOC’s failure to\n“state[ ] a legitimate reason” for the denial of a release plan,\nthe court concluded, “deprived [the inmates] of earned early\nrelease credits in violation of due process.” Id. at 1234\n(emphasis added).14 This holding is consistent with our con-\nclusion that Washington law requires that the DOC’s denial\nof a release plan be based on a “legitimate reason,” and that\nsuch reasons are enumerated in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   [6] In sum, we hold that the Washington statutory scheme\ngoverning transfer to community custody of those inmates\nwho have earned early release time creates a liberty interest\nthat is protected under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\n  14\n     The Liptrap court specifically noted section 72.09.340’s provision for\ndenial of a release plan because the proposed residence is near young chil-\ndren as a “legitimate statutory reason for disapproving a release plan for\na sex offender.” In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1233 & n.6 (citing WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)). For the reasons set forth in footnote 11 supra, this\nprovision is simply a specific example of the more general bases for denial\nset forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\f                           CARVER v.

In affirming the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of their section 1983 claim, the Chaney panel\nreached two alternative holdings.

In Dutcher, the second of\nthe two non-precedential dispositions, the panel’s conclusion that Wash-\nington law does not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity placement was supported only by a citation to Greenholtz.

Our qualified immunity\nanalysis proceeds in two parts. First, we consider whether\n“the facts alleged show that [Lehman’s] conduct violated a\nconstitutional right[.]” Galen, 477 F.3d at 658-59 (citing Sau-\ncier v.

For the reasons\ndiscussed above, we answer this question in the affirmative.\nSecond, we ask if “the right [Lehman is] alleged to have vio-\nlated [was] clearly established such that a reasonable [official]\nwould have understood that he was violating that right[.]” Id.\nWe conclude that the answer to this question is no.\n\n   [8] In determining whether the right alleged to have been\nviolated was clearly established, we must consider the right\n“in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad\ngeneral proposition[.]” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “ ‘The con-\ntours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that\nright.’ ” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987)). Here, because section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) does not use the more common mandatory\nterm “shall,” a reasonable correctional official might not have\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                     6529\nunderstood that the Washington statutory scheme created a\nliberty interest in early release into community custody. Cer-\ntainly, the question was highly debatable at the time that Leh-\nman was required to act. Carver’s plan was denied before the\nWashington Court of Appeals had issued its decisions in Dut-\ncher and Liptrap, which clarified that not only does a limited\nliberty interest exist under state law, but that the DOC’s dis-\ncretion to deny release into community custody is limited to\nrejection of a plan on the basis of the legitimate statutory\ncriteria set forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   [9] Because we conclude that the right at issue here was not\nsufficiently clear at the time of the facts giving rise to this\ncase such that a reasonable official would understand that\ndenying a release plan without providing a legitimate statu-\ntory reason for that denial would violate due process, we\naffirm the district court’s grant of qualified immunity.\n\n                       III.   Conclusion\n\n   Washington state law creates a liberty interest in an\ninmate’s early release into community custody that is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Carver was denied his due process right by the\nstate officials’ refusal to approve his release plan without\nreviewing it on its merits. At the time, however, the due pro-\ncess right arising from the existence of his liberty interest was\nnot sufficiently clearly established to meet the Saucier stan-\ndard. We therefore affirm the district court’s determination\nthat Lehman is entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nMILAN D. SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring in the\njudgment:\n\n   I respectfully part ways with the majority. I do not believe\nthat Washington State law creates a Fourteenth Amendment\n\f6530                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nliberty interest in early release into community custody. The\nmajority erroneously conjures a statutory liberty interest, pro-\ntected by the Due Process Clause, out of Wash. Rev. Code\n§ 9.94A.728(2) only by confusing “may” and “shall” and by\nreading “if” to mean “only if.”\n\n                               I.\n\n   “The preeminent canon of statutory construction requires\nus to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it\nmeans and means in a statute what it says there.” BedRoc Ltd.\nv.

Far from using “the more tra-\nditional mandatory language formula used in other early\nrelease statutes,” Maj. Op. at 6523, section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\ninstead uses traditional permissive “may . . . if” language used\nin statutes that create no liberty interest. Had the Washington\nState Legislature meant to write a statute limiting the discre-\ntion of the DOC, it could easily have said so. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) states that the DOC “may deny” convicted\nsex offenders transfer to community custody “if” it makes\ncertain determinations about the offender’s proposed release\nplan. It says nothing about the criteria for granting the\nrequest, let alone detailing circumstances under which the\nDOC must do so.\n\n   The majority overcomes the legislature’s failure to specify\nany criteria for granting a request by holding that the determi-\nnations mentioned in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are the only\nconditions on which the DOC may deny transfer, and there-\nfore requiring that it grant in all other cases. Maj. Op. at\n6523-24. One searches the statute in vain, however, for any\nindication that those determinations are the exclusive reasons\nthat the DOC “may deny” transfer. The criteria of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) are sufficient to deny sex offenders transfer,\nbut are not necessary. Had the legislature wished to make\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                            6531\nthem necessary, it would have used not “if” but “only if,” or\nsome semantic equivalent.1\n\n   In some cases, a court may read the word “if” to mean\n“only if.” The canon of construction expressio unius est exclu-\nsio alterius stands for the proposition that, when the legisla-\nture provides a list of related items, it impliedly means to\nexclude other items. See Norman J. Singer, 2A Sutherland\nStatutes and Statutory Construction § 47:23 (7th Ed. 2007).\nSuch a result obtains, however, only where there is some rea-\nson to believe that the legislature intended that the enumera-\ntion be exclusive—or at the very least in the absence of\nevidence to the contrary. “The maxim expressio unius est\nexclusio alterius is an aid to construction, not a rule of law.\nIt can never override clear and contrary evidences of [legisla-\ntive] intent.” Neuberger v.

It might\nhave said the DOC “shall” grant release “unless” the criteria are met or\n“if” they are not; it might have said that it “may” deny release “only if”\nthe criteria are met, or “except in the event” they are not; it might have\ncome up with another formulation that means substantially the same thing.\n   The distinction between “if” and “only if,” however, is not a mere quib-\nble over vocabulary—it goes right to the heart of whether the criteria of\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d) are necessary or sufficient conditions for transfer,\nand therefore whether transfer is mandatory or entirely discretionary.\n“May . . . only if” would be effectively identical to “shall . . . unless ”;\n“may . . . if” is not. Contra Maj. Op. at 6523-24. In formal terms, the\nmajority commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent: from the premise\n“if P, then Q,” it does not follow from “not P” that “not Q.” See generally\nRuggero J.

In this case, however, the majority uses the\ntechnique sub silentio to override the unambiguously discre-\ntionary language in the statute (“may”).\n\n   The language of Wash. Rev. Code section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\nmakes it clear that the provision’s purpose is to expand the\ndiscretion of the DOC. This makes the majority’s implicit\nexpressio unius reading especially inappropriate. The statute\nstates: “The department’s authority under this section is inde-\npendent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or statu-\ntory provision regarding conditions for community custody or\ncommunity placement.” Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.728(2)(d).\nThat language makes the function of section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\napparent: to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny trans-\nfer in the event that it makes one of the four determinations,\nnotwithstanding what other legal sources might otherwise\nrequire. The majority’s reading of the statute, however, turns\nthat meaning on its head, transmuting a non obstante provi-\nsion written to preserve or expand discretion into one with the\neffect of limiting it.\n\n                              II.\n\n   I might still concur with this misreading of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d), however, if the Washington State courts had\nsimilarly misread the statute.

Cashaw instead held that the inmate’s right to challenge his\nrestraint because of procedural error is grounded in Washington Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 16.4. Id. at 13-14. Notwithstanding the holding of\nCashaw, Dutcher refers to an inmate’s “protected liberty interest” in “the\ndepartment’s compliance with requirements of statute affecting his\nrelease,” citing Cashaw itself for the proposition. 60 P.3d at 636 & n.3\n(citing Cashaw, 866 P.2d at 11).\n  As the majority notes, Dutcher “recognizes a liberty interest in both the\nsubstantive right to early release . . .and the distinct procedural right to\n\f6534                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\ndecide whether or when to consider an offender for transfer\nto community custody,” Liptrap, 60 P.3d at 638 (emphasis\nadded), Washington’s courts have given no indication that its\ndiscretion is substantially limited in how it makes that consid-\neration.\n\n   None of the cases cited by the majority implies that the\ncriteria in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are the exclusive reasons\nthat the DOC may deny transfer to community custody. Lip-\ntrap notes that the statute “stat[es] reasons why the depart-\nment may deny a release plan,” 111 P.3d at 1232, but those\n“reasons” are kept in the indefinite: they are just “reasons”—\nnot the reasons, let alone the only reasons—for denial. Simi-\nlarly, Dutcher held that “the statute . . . requires DOC to base\nits community custody eligibility decisions on the merits of\nthe release plan,” 60 P.3d at 638, but does not imply that sec-\ntion 9.94A.728(2)(d) provides the sole rubric by which those\n“merits” are to be evaluated.\n\nhave the DOC comply with the requirements of the statutes governing\nsuch release.” Maj. Op. at 6524-25 n.13 (emphasis added). Because Dut-\ncher’s holding concerns only the latter, procedural right, its description of\nthe former can only be described as dicta. As with much dicta, it risks\nimprecision, using the same term, “liberty interest,” to refer both to the\nsubstantive interest in transfer, which could conceivably be a Fourteenth\nAmendment “liberty interest,” and the procedural right to compliance with\nregulation, which cannot. If a chef announces that the dessert will consist\nof “fruit,” but in the very next breath lists “herring” and “quartz” as other\nkinds of “fruit,” one might be forgiven in beginning to doubt that the\ndish’s ingredients have necessarily been plucked off a tree.\n   Notwithstanding its use of traditional Due Process Clause terminology\nand concepts, therefore, the only charitable reading of Dutcher, not\nsquarely foreclosed by both United States and Washington State Supreme\nCourt precedent, is that the Washington Court of Appeals is using “liberty\ninterest” far more broadly than the term of art of federal Due Process juris-\nprudence that the majority contemplates, encompassing any right cogniza-\nble at law with some bearing on whether one receives liberty. No other\nreading is possible in light of precedent that has held that a right to process\nis no more a Fourteenth Amendment “liberty interest” than a herring is a\nfruit.

LEHMAN                         6535\n   Washington courts have implied only one limit on the sub-\nstance of the DOC’s exercise of discretion: its reasons for\ndenial must be “legitimate.” Id. But contrary to the majority’s\nassertions, there is no indication that a reason may acquire\n“legitimacy” only by its enumeration in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d). Indeed, there is every indication to the con-\ntrary: it was Crowder, a decision predating the enactment of\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d) by three years, that first mentioned\n“legitimate reasons” for denial of community custody. 985\nP.2d at 946. Moreover, Crowder specified the petitioner’s\n“own withdrawal of a suggested placement plan” as among\nthe “legitimate reasons” for denying him transfer, id.—a rea-\nson which certainly seems legitimate, but appears nowhere in\nsection 9.94A.728(2)(d). Neither Dutcher nor Liptrap hint\nthat subsequent codification of certain legitimate reasons has\nsomehow narrowed the range of legitimacy, and no Washing-\nton case has provided a general definition for what makes a\nreason “legitimate,” which could be as broad as “any reason\nnot otherwise proscribed by law.”4 This ill-defined “right” to\ntransfer only in the absence of some “legitimate” reason to\ndeny is hardly sufficient to produce the “legitimate expecta-\ntion of release” required of a protected liberty interest under\nGreenholtz v.
