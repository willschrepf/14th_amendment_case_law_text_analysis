He was\ninformed by the medical staff at the State Correctional\nInstitution at Pittsburgh (SCIP) that his medical condition\nwould be kept confidential. However, because of certain\npractices permitted by prison officials, Doe's condition was\nnot kept confidential. Doe sued under 42 U.S.C.S 1983,\nclaiming that prison practices violated his right to medical\nprivacy under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the\nPennsylvania Confidentiality of HIV-Related Information\nAct, 35 P.S. S 7601 et seq. The District Court granted\ndefendants' motions to dismiss the S 1983 claims on the\nbasis of qualified immunity, declined jurisdiction over the\nstate claims, and dismissed the case.\n\nAlthough we ultimately agree that defendants ar e entitled\nto qualified immunity, we do not agree with the District\n\n                                  2\n\fCourt's reasoning. We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment\nprotects an inmate's right to medical privacy, subject to\nlegitimate penological interests. However , because this right\nwas not clearly established at the time of defendants'\nconduct, we will affirm the dismissal of Doe's complaint.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nJohn Doe arrived at SCIP on January 11, 1995. Shortly\nthereafter, Doe was informed by the medical staff that he\nwas HIV-positive. After signing a written consent of\ndisclosure form, he was told that his medical condition\nwould be kept confidential and that medical r ecords\nrelating to his illness would be maintained separately from\nhis general prison file.\n\nBecause of certain procedures permitted by defendants,\nDoe's condition was not kept confidential. Specifically,\nwhen Doe was taken for sick call appointments, staf f\ninformed the escorting officers of Doe's medical condition.\nDuring physician visits, staff kept the door to the clinic\nroom open, allowing officers, inmates, and guards in the\narea to see and hear Doe and the treating physician.\nFinally, while administering medication, nurses announced\nhis medication loudly enough for others to hear , allowing\ninmates to infer Doe's condition. Doe filed administrative\ngrievances concerning the sick call and medication\ndistribution practices, but the grievances did not bring\nabout any change in the practices.\n\nOn July 11, 1997, Doe, proceeding pr o se, filed suit\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983 and the Pennsylvania\nConfidentiality of HIV-Related Infor mation Act, 35 P.S.\nS 7601 et seq. in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint named as\ndefendants Joan Delie, Health Care Administrator at SCIP;\nDr. Paul Noel, Medical Director of SCIP; Diane Manson, a\nNurse/Grievance Officer; and Sophie Swika and Kim\nZimmerman, both nurses at SCIP. Doe claimed his\nconstitutional right to privacy was violated by the\"open-\ndoor\" examination room policy, by the disclosure of his\nmedical condition to corrections officer escorts, and by the\nloud announcement of the names of his medications. He\n\n                               3\n\falleged that these practices made him reluctant to discuss\nembarrassing symptoms with doctors, subjected him to\npsychological harassment and humiliation, and caused him\nto discontinue treatment. Doe requested declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, as well as nominal, compensatory, and\npunitive damages.\n\nOn August 5, 1997, Doe filed motions for a temporary\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction ordering\ndefendants to provide for nondisclosure of his medical\ninformation during sick call visits and medication\ndistribution. The Magistrate Judge recommended that both\nmotions be denied pending service of the complaint and\nmotions on defendants. This Report and Recommendation\nwas adopted by the District Court on September 16, 1997.\n\nAfter service of the complaint,1 defendants Delie, Manson,\nand Swika, and defendant Noel by separate motion, moved\nto dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Doe was granted leave to\nfile an amended complaint and did so on Mar ch 3, 1998.\nThe amended complaint added James Price, the\nsuperintendent of SCIP, as a defendant and otherwise\nreasserted Doe's privacy claims. Defendants r easserted\ntheir motions to dismiss based, inter alia, on the defense of\nqualified immunity, which shields public officials from\nactions for damages unless their conduct was unr easonable\nin light of clearly established law.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge issued a Report and\nRecommendation on September 21, 1998. The Magistrate\nfound that no clear federal constitutional right to\nnondisclosure of an inmate's medical condition exists and\nrecommended dismissal of defendants Delie, Manson,\nSwika, and Price on grounds of qualified immunity. The\nMagistrate found that the only involvement alleged as to\ndefendant Noel was his inadequate response to Doe's\ngrievances, which did not give rise to a S 1983 claim. In\naddition, the Magistrate Judge found, sua sponte , that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Nurse Zimmerman was never served with pr ocess in the district court.\nShe is not a Commonwealth employee, and was appar ently referred to\nSCIP through a private nursing facility. Ef forts to locate her at that\nagency were unsuccessful.\n\n                                4\n\fdefendant Zimmerman was entitled to qualified immunity\nfor her alleged misconduct and recommended dismissal of\nthe complaint against her pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Finally, the Magistrate Judge\nrecommended that the District Court decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Doe's state law claims.\n\nOver Doe's objections, the District Court adopted the\nMagistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and\ndismissed the case on December 17, 1998. On January 13,\n1999, Doe filed his notice of appeal of the District Court's\ndecision. We appointed counsel for Doe and have benefitted\nas a result from counsel's willingness to undertake this\nrepresentation.\n\nShortly before oral argument, counsel informed us that\nDoe was awaiting a re-trial on his conviction. Counsel has\nnow informed us that Doe was acquitted in his re-trial, and\ntherefore is no longer an inmate at SCIP .\n\nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over\nDoe's S 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S 1331 and over\nthe state law claim under 28 U.S.C. S 1367. W e have\nappellate jurisdiction over the District Court'sfinal\njudgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291. W e exercise\nplenary review over the District Court's dismissal of a\ncomplaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\nstate a claim. Piecknick v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n36 F.3d 1250, 1255 (3d Cir. 1994). W e must accept as true\nall of the factual allegations in the complaint as well as the\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn fr om them. Moore\nv. Tartler, 986 F.2d 682, 685 (3d Cir. 1993). We may\ndismiss the complaint only if it is clear that no r elief could\nbe granted under any set of facts that could be pr oved\nconsistent with the allegations. Hishon v. King & Spalding,\n467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984).\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nBecause Doe is no longer an inmate at SCIP, we must\nfirst consider whether his claims are moot before reviewing\nthe District Court's qualified immunity analysis.\n\n                               5\n\fA. MOOTNESS\n\nThe Constitution limits the power of the federal judiciary\nto the resolution of \"cases and contr oversies.\" See U.S.\nConst. art. III, S 2, cl.1. Federal courts ar e not empowered\nto decide moot questions. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S.\n244, 246 (1971) (per curiam). The mootness doctrine\nrequires that an actual controversy exist at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed. New\nJersey Turnpike Auth. v. Jersey Cent. Power & Light, 772\nF.2d 25, 31 (3d Cir. 1985).\n\nWe have stated that \"mootness has two aspects: (1) the\nissues presented are no longer `live' or (2) the parties lack\na cognizable interest in the outcome.\" Id. As a result of his\nacquittal, Doe is no longer an inmate at SCIP . It is clear\nthat any declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the\nstaff at SCIP would have no impact on him, and therefore\nhis equitable claims are moot.\n\nDoe argues that his case falls into the \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review\" exception to the mootness\ndoctrine. The exception is limited to cases which have two\nelements: \"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too\nshort to be fully litigated to its cessation or expiration and\n(2) there is a reasonable likelihood that the same\ncomplaining party would be subjected to the same action\nagain.\" Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, 4 F .3d 195, 206 (3d Cir.\n1993) (emphasis omitted), quoting Weinstein v. Bradford,\n423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975)(per curiam). Given the length of\ntime it took Doe, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis,\nto reach this stage of the litigation, we will assume,\narguendo, that the first element is satisfied.\n\nHowever, as a result of his acquittal, we simply cannot\nconclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that he would\nbe subjected to the same conduct. See Weinstein, 423 U.S.\nat 149 (former inmate's challenge to par ole decisions\nmooted upon his release from supervision); see also Abdul-\nAkbar, 4 F.3d at 206 (cautioning against\"conjecture\" that\nprisoner could again be incarcerated at maximum security\nunit and holding prisoner's release from maximum security\nunit mooted challenge to law library in maximum security\nunit).2 Doe is no longer incar cerated at SCIP. Because there\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. But see Doe v. Wigginton, 21 F .3d 733, 736 (6th Cir. 1994) (no\ndiscussion of mootness, although facts state plaintiff was released from\n\n                               6\n\fis no reasonable likelihood that Doe will be subjected to the\nsame action, Doe's acquittal has clearly mooted his claims\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nNonetheless, where a plaintiff has r equested several\nforms of relief and some of the r equests become moot, the\ncourt must still consider the viability of the r emaining\nrequests. Jersey Cent. Power & Light Co. v. State of New\nJersey, 772 F.2d 35, 40 (3d Cir. 1985). \"[T]he availability of\ndamages or other monetary relief almost always avoids\nmootness.\" Id. at 41.3 Therefore, we must review the\nDistrict Court's qualified immunity analysis with respect to\nDoe's nominal and punitive damages claims.\n\nB. A PRISONER'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN MEDICAL\nRECORDS\n\nSection 1983 imposes civil liability upon any person who,\nacting under the color of state law, deprives another\nindividual of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by\nthe Constitution or laws of the United States. 42 U.S.C.\nS 1983. This section does not create any new substantive\nrights, but it provides a remedy for the violation of a federal\nconstitutional or statutory right conferred elsewhere. Baker\nv. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n.3 (1979).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nprison prior to appeal). The Sixth Circuit r eached the merits to dismiss\nthe privacy claim of an HIV-positive prisoner , but, as discussed in\nfootnote six, infra, the substantive law of privacy in the Sixth Circuit\nconflicts with that of the Third Circuit.\n\n3. While the District Court did not consider the effect of S 803(d)(e) of\nthe\nPrison Litigation Reform Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(e), on Doe's\nclaims, we have since recognized that S 1997e(e) prohibits compensatory\ndamages for mental or emotional injury absent allegations of physical\ninjury. Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 251 (3d Cir. 2000). However,\nS 1997e(e) does not bar claims seeking nominal damages to vindicate\nconstitutional rights, nor claims seeking punitive damages to deter or\npunish egregious violations of constitutional rights. Id. Therefore, while\nDoe's claims for compensatory damage are barr ed by S 1997e(e), his\nclaims for nominal damages survive. Moreover , to the extent that Doe's\npunitive damages claims stem solely from the violations of his right to\nmedical privacy, and not from any emotional or mental distress suffered,\nthose claims are not barred by S 1997e(e). See id. at 252.\n\n                               7\n\fWhen the defendant in a S 1983 action claims qualified\nimmunity, a court must first determine if the plaintiff 's\nallegations are sufficient to establish the violation of a\nfederal constitutional or statutory right. W ilson v. Layne,\n526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999), citing Conn v. Gabbert , 526 U.S.\n286, 290 (1999).4 If the plaintif f 's allegations meet this\nthreshold, a court must next determine whether the right\nthat the defendant's conduct allegedly violated was a clearly\nestablished one, about which a reasonable person would\nhave known. Id. If the plaintiff 's allegations fail to satisfy\neither inquiry, then a defendant is entitled to qualified\nimmunity and dismissal of the case. Deciding \"this purely\nlegal question permits courts expeditiously to weed out\nsuits which fail the test without requiring a defendant who\nrightly claims qualified immunity to engage in expensive\nand time consuming preparation to defend the suit on its\nmerits.\" Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991).\n\nWith this framework in mind, we must deter mine\nwhether an HIV-positive inmate has a right to privacy in his\nmedical information. If so, we must deter mine whether that\nright was clearly established in 1995.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Notwithstanding the fact that the Supr eme Court has twice stated in\nmandatory, unqualified language that \"[a] court evaluating a claim of\nqualified immunity must first deter mine whether the plaintiff has alleged\nthe deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all . . .\" Wilson,\n526\nU.S. at 609 quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. at 290 (internal\nquotations omitted) (emphasis added), Judge Garth's dissent would\nprefer that we skip the first prong of qualified immunity analysis. See\nDissent, infra at p. 40. This practice ignor es the Supreme Court's\nexpress language and creates an exception based on the procedural\nposture of the case. While there may be pragmatic considerations\nfavoring Judge Garth's qualification of the Supr eme Court's unqualified\nlanguage, the Court has not yet suggested any basis for departing from\nthe rule articulated in Wilson. Our thr eshold task here, in qualified\nimmunity analysis, is to determine whether Doe has alleged a violation\nof a constitutional right. We hold that he has, although the full extent\nof\nthat right in the prison setting has yet to be delineated. Whether and\nhow prison officials must accommodate, or may curtail and even\nextinguish that right, in light of the penological interests concerned, is\nnot before the Court today.\n\n                               8\n\f1.\n\nAn individual has a constitutional right to privacy which\nprotects \"the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of\npersonal matters.\" Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599\n(1977). We have long recognized the right to privacy in one's\nmedical information: \"There can be no question that . . .\nmedical records, which may contain intimate facts of a\npersonal nature, are well within the ambit of materials\nentitled to privacy protection.\" United States v.\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp. 638 F.2d 570, 577 (3d Cir. 1980).\nThe right to privacy in one's medical information extends to\nprescription records. Doe v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth.,\n72 F.3d 1133, 1138 (3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied 519 U.S.\n808 (1996) [hereinafter \"Doe v. SEPT A\"]. In Doe v. SEPTA,\nwe acknowledged that the privacy interest in information\nregarding one's HIV status is particularly strong because of\nthe stigma, potential for harassment, and \"risk of much\nharm from non-consensual dissemination of the\ninformation.\" Id. at 1140.\n\nThe District Court recognized Doe's right to privacy in his\nmedical information, but concluded that such a right does\nnot exist in prison. We disagree. As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, prison inmates do not shed all fundamental\nprotections of the Constitution at the prison gates. Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974). Inmates r etain those\nrights that are not inconsistent with their status as\nprisoners or with the legitimate penological objectives of the\ncorrections system. Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822\n(1974).\n\nFor example, prisoners retain rights af forded by the First\nAmendment. O'Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348 (1987).\nThey retain the protection of due pr ocess, Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n555, and the protection against racial discrimination. Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U.S. 333, 334 (1968) (per curiam). Of\ncourse, prisoners retain the Eighth Amendment's protection\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment. Wilson v. Seiter,\n501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991). While many rights survive\nincarceration, however, it is clear that some rights retained\nby free citizens are necessarily extinguished by\nimprisonment.\n\n                               9\n\fThe defendants correctly assert that prisoners do not\nhave a Fourth Amendment right to privacy in their cells.\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 529 (1984). The Supreme\nCourt has concluded that the Fourth Amendment right to\nprivacy, to be free from unreasonable searches, is\nfundamentally inconsistent with incarceration. Id. at 527.\nMindful that internal security is a chief concern in prisons,\nthe Court recognized that it would be impossible to prevent\nthe introduction of weapons, drugs and other contraband\ninto the premises if prisoners maintained a right of privacy\nin their cells. Id. Therefore,\"the Fourth Amendment has no\napplicability to a prison cell.\" Id. at 536.\n\nHowever, Doe's asserted right to privacy in his medical\ninformation is completely differ ent than the right\nextinguished in Hudson. See, e.g., Powell v. Schriver, 175\nF.3d 107, 112 n.3 (2d Cir. 1999) (noting right to\nconfidentiality of medical information is distinct from right\nof privacy implicated in Hudson); Anderson v. Romero, 72\nF.3d 518, 522 (7th Cir. 1995) (same). The Hudson court\nconfirmed that a Fourth Amendment right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures is inconsistent with\nincarceration. In the instant case, Doe is asserting his\nFourteenth Amendment right to privacy in his medical\ninformation. The right to nondisclosur e of one's medical\ninformation emanates from a different source5 and protects\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the gover nment from conducting\nunreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV. While\ncourts and commentators have emphasized the privacy interests\nprotected by the Fourth Amendment, the Supr eme Court has clarified\nthat the Fourth Amendment \"protects individual privacy against certain\nkinds of governmental intrusion, but its pr otections go further, and\noften\nhave nothing to do with privacy at all.\" Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.\n347, 350 (1967).\n\nThere are at least two types of privacy pr otected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment: the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters, and the right to autonomy and independence in personal\ndecision-making. See Whalen, 429 U.S. at 599-600; Westinghouse, 638\nF.2d at 577. Cases in the latter category describe the liberty interests\nin\nmatters relating to marriage, procr eation, contraception, family\nrelationships, and child rearing and education. See e.g. Troxel v.\nGranville, 120 S.Ct. 2054 (2000) (parents' rights to make decisions\n\n                               10\n\fdifferent interests than the right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures. Compare Whalen, 429\nU.S. at 598-99 with Hudson, 468 U.S. at 525.\n\nIt is beyond question that information about one's HIV-\npositive status is information of the most personal kind and\nthat an individual has an interest in pr otecting against the\ndissemination of such information. See Doe v. SEPTA, 72\nF.3d at 1140; Westinghouse, 638 F.2d at 577. Moreover, a\nprisoner's right to privacy in this medical infor mation is not\nfundamentally inconsistent with incarceration. Therefore,\nwe join the Second Circuit in recognizing that the\nconstitutional right to privacy in one's medical information\nexists in prison. See Powell, 175 F.3d at 112.\n\nWe acknowledge, however, that a prisoner does not enjoy\na right of privacy in his medical information to the same\nextent as a free citizen. We do not suggest that Doe has a\nright to conceal this diagnosed medical condition fr om\neveryone in the corrections system. Doe's constitutional\nright is subject to substantial restrictions and limitations in\norder for correctional officials to achieve legitimate\ncorrectional goals and maintain institutional security.\n\nSpecifically, an inmate's constitutional right may be\ncurtailed by a policy or regulation that is shown to be\n\"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\"\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). Courts must\nrespect the administrative concerns underlying a prison\nregulation, without requiring proof that the regulation is\nthe least restrictive means of addressing those concerns.\nWe have summarized the analysis as follows:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nconcerning care and custody of childr en); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113\n(1973) (right to abortion); Loving v. Vir ginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)\n(freedom\nto marry); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (right to marital\nprivacy in use of contraceptives); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.\n510 (1925) (parents' right to teach own childr en); Meyer v. Nebraska,\n262 U.S. 390 (1923) (right to teach foreign language). As described\nabove, Doe's privacy interest clearly falls into the first category. Some\ncourts have referred to the first category as a \"right to\nconfidentiality,\" to\ndistinguish it from the right to autonomy and independence in personal\ndecision making. E.g. Powell v. Schriver , 175 F.3d 107, 113-14 (2d. Cir.\n1999).\n\n                               11\n\f       [Turner] directs courts to assess the overall\n       reasonableness of such regulations by weighing four\n       factors. First, there must be a valid, rational\n       connection between the prison regulation and the\n       legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify\n       it, and this connection must not be so remote as to\n       render the policy arbitrary or irrational. Second, a\n       court must consider whether inmates retain alternative\n       means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a\n       court must take into account the costs that\n       accommodating the right would impose on other\n       inmates, guards, and prison resour ces generally. And\n       fourth, a court must consider whether there ar e\n       alternatives to the regulation that fully accommodate\n       the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid\n       penological interests.\n\nDehart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 51 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\nAppellant alleges that his constitutional right to privacy\nin his medical information was violated by thr ee practices:\nthe \"open-door\" examination room policy, the disclosure of\nhis medical condition to corrections officer escorts, and the\nloud announcement of the names of his medications. Doe\nconcedes that the \"open door\" examination r oom policy\ncould conceivably be justified by a legitimate security\ninterest but contends that no such inter est has been\nadvanced here. In addition, Doe maintains that the other\ndisclosures are unrelated to any legitimate penological\ninterests, and thus violated his right to privacy.\n\nGiven the disposition of the case by the District Court,\ndefendants did not have the opportunity to come forward\nwith any evidence of legitimate penological inter ests, costs\nof accommodating Doe's privacy interest, or availability of\nalternatives to the disclosures made her e. Based on this\nundeveloped record, we are unable to assess any of the\nTurner factors. Rather than speculating about these factors,\nwe ordinarily would remand for consideration by the trial\ncourt on those issues. However, we need not decide those\nissues in this case because of our disposition of the second\nprong of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\n                               12\n\f2.\n\nAs stated earlier, the qualified immunity doctrine shields\npublic officials from actions for damages unless their\nconduct was unreasonable in light of clearly established\nlaw. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). We\nhave recognized that qualified immunity applies if\n\"reasonable officials in the defendants' position at the\nrelevant time could have believed, in light of what was in\nthe decided case law, that their conduct would be lawful.\"\nGood v. Dauphin County Social Servs. for Childr en & Youth,\n891 F.2d 1087, 1092 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nThus, having determined that Doe has alleged a violation\nof a constitutional right, we must determine whether Doe's\nright to privacy was \"clearly established\" in a\n\"particularized\" sense. Anderson v. Cr eighton, 483 U.S. 635,\n640 (1987). \"The contours of the right must be sufficiently\nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what\nhe is doing violates that right.\" Id. W e do not require precise\nfactual correspondence between the right asserted and\nprior case law. Good, 891 F.2d at 1092. Whether an official\nmay be protected by qualified immunity tur ns on the\n\"objective legal reasonableness of the action, assessed in\nlight of the legal rules that were clearly established at the\ntime it was taken.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 614\n(1999) (internal quotes omitted). The issue is whether, given\nthe established law and the information available to\nDefendants, reasonable prison officials in Defendants'\npositions could have believed that their conduct was lawful.\nSee Paff v. Kaltenback, 204 F.3d 425, 431 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nAppellant makes three arguments in support of his\ncontention that his right to privacy in his medical\ninformation was clearly established in 1995. First, Doe\nargues that a Pennsylvania statute both cr eates a right and\nserves to inform defendants of the existence of that right.\nSecond, Doe argues that, by 1995, a \"gr owing consensus\"\nof other courts had held that inmates possess a right to\nprivacy in their medical records. Finally, Doe argues that\nthe class action settlement in Austin v. Pennsylvania Dept.\nof Corrections, 876 F. Supp. 1437 (E.D.Pa. 1995), put\ndefendants on specific notice of the existence of a prisoner's\n\n                               13\n\fconstitutional right to privacy in his medical infor mation.\nWe address each argument in tur n.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Confidentiality of HIV-Related\nInformation Act, 35 P.S. S 7603, became effective March 1,\n1991. Under the Act, any person who obtains confidential\nHIV-related information in the course of providing health or\nsocial services, or pursuant to consent, may not disclose\nthe information, except by consent, or to certain designated\npersons. 35 P.S. S 7607. The state right is enforceable in a\nprivate cause of action for damages. 35 P.S.S 7610. Doe\ncontends that he consented to the HIV test but did not\nconsent to the various disclosures made by defendants.\nWhile Doe concedes that the state statute cannot be the\nbasis for his federal action, he argues that prison officials\ncould not have been acting \"reasonably\" when they were in\ndirect violation of a clear state statute; they thus lost the\nprotections of qualified immunity.\n\nThis argument misinterprets the ef fect of a state law on\na federal constitutional claim. The Supreme Court has held\nthat officials do not forfeit qualified immunity from suit for\nviolation of a federal constitutional right because they failed\nto comply with a clear state statute. Davis v. Scherer, 468\nU.S. 183, 195 (1984); see also D.R. by L.R. v. Middle Bucks\nArea Vocat'l Tech. School, 972 F.2d 1364, 1375-76 (3d Cir.\n1992) (en banc) (\"[I]llegality under the state statute can\nneither add to nor subtract from the constitutional validity\nof a state's actions.\") (internal quotes and citation omitted).\nTo overcome qualified immunity, Doe's clearly established\nright must be the federal right on which the claim for relief\nis based.6 Claims for violations of the Pennsylvania\nConfidentiality of HIV-Related Infor mation Act can be\nvindicated in state courts, or, as Doe did here, as a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. For example, state law may bear upon a claim under the Due Process\nclause when the property interest pr otected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment is created by state law. See Boar d of Regents v. Roth, 408\nU.S. 564, 577 (1972); Acierno v. Cloutier , 40 F.3d 597 (3d. Cir. 1994). A\nfederal statute can provide the clearly established right when it is the\nbasis for the action. See, e.g. Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980)\n(vindicating rights under Social Security Act). This case involves neither\nsituation.\n\n                               14\n\fsupplemental claim. But the state statute cannot\"clearly\nestablish\" the federal right for qualified immunity purposes.\n\nSecond, a review of decisions which had addr essed the\nissue by 1995 reveals that no court of appeals had held\nthat prisoners retained a constitutional right to the privacy\nof their medical information. In fact, only a handful of\ndistrict court opinions had done so.\n\nThe earliest circuit opinion addressing the issue analyzed\na prison policy of segregating HIV-positive inmates from the\ngeneral prison population. Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d\n1495, 1515-1521 (11th Cir. 1991). In Harris, the Eleventh\nCircuit stated that the \"precise natur e and scope of the\nprivacy right at issue in this case is rather ill-defined.\" Id.\nat 1513. Nevertheless, the court assumed, ar guendo, that\nHIV-positive inmates had a \"constitutionally-protected\nprivacy interest\" in nondisclosure of their medical\ninformation. The court acknowledged that \"the scope of\nsuch a right, however, is far from settled, and we need not\ndivine its precise parameters here,\" Id. at 1513 n. 26,\nbecause it found that the Department of Corr ections'\ndecision to segregate such inmates from the general prison\npopulation served a legitimate penological inter est in\nreducing the transmission of HIV and reducing the threat\nof violence. Id. at 1521.\n\nPrior to 1995, other courts of appeals likewise upheld the\nsegregation of HIV-positive inmates fr om the general\npopulation. See, e.g. Camarillo v. McCarthy, 998 F.2d 638,\n640 n.2 (9th Cir. 1993) (reserving question of whether HIV\nsegregation policy is constitutional but holding officers\nentitled to qualified immunity); Moore v. Mabus, 976 F.2d\n268, 271 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding HIV segr egation policy\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests).7 Of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. By 1995, the Sixth Circuit had explicitly held that the right of\nprivacy\nis not implicated at all by prison official's disclosure of an inmate's\nHIV\nstatus. See Doe v. Wigginton, 21 F.3d 733, 740 (6th Cir. 1994). However,\nSixth Circuit law conflicts with our cir cuit on this issue because the\nSixth Circuit does not recognize the right to privacy in one's medical\ninformation in any setting. Compare J.P. v. DeSanti, 653 F.2d 1080 (6th\nCir. 1981) (no right to privacy in \"social histories\" and medical records)\nwith United States v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 638 F.2d 570 (3d Cir.\n1980) (right to privacy in medical recor ds).\n\n                               15\n\fcourse, the nature of the disclosures in HIV housing\nsegregation cases is different than the disclosures Doe\nchallenges here.\n\nIn 1995, the Seventh Circuit considered disclosures that\nare closer to the ones that occurred in the present case.\nAnderson v. Romero, 72 F.3d 518 (7th Cir. 1995). In\nAnderson, the prison superintendent told a guar d, in the\npresence of another guard, to make sur e inmate Anderson\nwas in a cell by himself because he was HIV-positive. The\ninformation was repeated to at least one other guard. The\nAnderson court recognized a \"qualified constitutional right\nto confidentiality of medical records and medical\ncommunications\" outside of prison, but concluded that it\nwas an open question as to whether the right applied in the\nprison setting. Id. at 522. The court r ejected two district\ncourt opinions which had found that nonsystematic\ndisclosures of HIV status had violated HIV -positive inmates'\nright to privacy and instead relied on the fact no appellate\ncourt had yet recognized the right. Id. at 523-25 (discussing\nWoods v. White, 689 F. Supp. 874 (W.D.Wis. 1988) aff 'd\n899 F.2d 17 (7th Cir. 1990) (table) and Rodriguez v.\nCoughlin, 1989 WL 59607 (W.D.N.Y. 1989). The Anderson\ncourt concluded that the officials were entitled to qualified\nimmunity because, if such a right existed, it was not clearly\nestablished in 1992 nor in 1995.8Id. at 524.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The appellate cases illustrate the problem identified by the Supreme\nCourt in qualified immunity cases: \"[T]he generally sound rule of\navoiding determination of constitutional issues does not readily fit the\nsituation presented here [because] when liability is claimed on the basis\nof a constitutional violation, even a finding of qualified immunity\nrequires some determination about the state of constitutional law at the\ntime the officer acted. What is more significant is that if the policy of\navoidance [of constitutional issues] wer e always followed in favor of\nruling on qualified immunity whenever ther e was no clearly settled\nconstitutional rule of primary conduct, standar ds of official conduct\nwould tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment both of officials and\nindividuals. An immunity determination, with nothing more, provides no\nclear standard, constitutional or non-constitutional . . . . therefore the\nbetter approach is to determine the right before determining whether it\nwas previously established with clarity.\" County of Sacramento v. Lewis,\n523 U.S. 833, 841 n.5 (1998). See also W ilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,\n609 (1999).\n\n                               16\n\fWe note that Doe has cited several district court cases\nwhich concluded, by 1995, that inmates have a right to\nprivacy in their medical information. See Austin v.\nPennsylvania Dept. of Corrections, 876 F . Supp. 1437\n(E.D.Pa. 1995) (approving class action settlement including\npolicies regarding treatment of HIV positive inmates);\nClarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F. Supp. 1019 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)\n(failure to provide qualified interpr eters violated deaf\ninmates' right to privacy); Faison v. Parker, 823 F. Supp.\n1198 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (disclosure of inmate's medical\nconditions in presentence report did not violate right to\nprivacy); Nolley v. County of Erie, 776 F . Supp. 715\n(W.D.N.Y. 1991) (HIV-positive inmate's right to privacy\nviolated by involuntary segregation and placing red stickers\non his documents); Doe v. Coughlin, 697 F . Supp. 1234,\n1238 (N.D.N.Y. 1988) (granting preliminary injunction to\nhalt involuntary segregation of HIV-positive inmates);\nWoods v. White, 689 F. Supp. 874, 876 (W.D. Wis. 1988),\naff 'd 899 F.2d 17 (7th Cir . 1990) (table) (gratuitous\ndisclosure of HIV-positive status to guar ds and inmates\nviolated constitutional right to privacy).\n\nOf course, all of these opinions are factually and legally\ndistinguishable from the present case. Both Nolley and Doe\nv. Coughlin are HIV-positive inmate segregation cases.\nThese cases conflict with the subsequent appellate HIV\nsegregation cases, which upheld the practice. 9 See\nCamarillo, 998 F.2d at 640; Moor e, 976 F.2d at 271; Harris,\n941 F.2d at 1515-21. Likewise, the district court decision in\nWhite v. Woods was specifically considered and rejected by\nthe Seventh Circuit's opinion in Anderson v. Romero. 72\nF.3d at 525 (holding prisoners had no clearly established\nright to privacy in medical records in 1995). In Faison, the\ndistrict court found that disclosure of an inmate's medical\nconditions in a court-ordered presentence report did not\nviolate the inmate's right to privacy. 823 F . Supp. at 1205.\nAnd Clarkson v. Coughlin addressed deaf inmates, not HIV-\npositive ones. 898 F. Supp. at 1024.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. These opinions also conflict with other New York district court cases\nwhich upheld the segregation of HIV-positive inmates. See Baez v.\nRapping, 680 F. Supp. 112 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); Cordero v. Coughlin, 607 F.\nSupp. 9 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).\n\n                               17\n\fIn short, none of these decisions, individually or\ncollectively, makes it sufficiently clear to r easonable officials\nthat their conduct violated a prisoner's federal\nconstitutional right. District court opinions may be relevant\nto the determination of when a right was clearly established\nfor qualified immunity analysis.10 However, in this case, the\nabsence of binding precedent in this cir cuit,11 the doubts\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. See Hayes v. Long, 72 F.3d 70, 73-74 (8th Cir. 1995) (looking to all\ndecisional law, including Supreme Court, cir cuit courts, district courts,\nand state court opinions for clearly established rights); Tribble v.\nGardner, 860 F.2d 321, 324 (9th Cir . 1988)(same). We note that the\nFourth, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits do not look to district court\ndecisions to determine if rights are clearly established. See, e.g., Anaya\nv. Crossroads Managed Care Sys., Inc., 195 F.3d 584, 594 (10th Cir.\n1999) (considering only Supreme Court, forum circuit, highest state\ncourt, or clearly established weight of authority fr om other circuit\ncourts); Edwards v. City of Goldsboro 178 F.3d 231, 251 (4th Cir.\n1999)(considering only Supreme Court, forum cir cuit and highest state\ncourt); Jenkins by Hall v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., 115 F.3d 821, 826\nn.4 (11th Cir.) cert. denied, Jenkins ex rel. Hall v. Herring, 522 U.S.\n966\n(1997)(same). The Second and Seventh Circuits consider district court\nopinions as evidence of the law but hold that they cannot clearly\nestablish the law of the circuit. Anderson , 72 F.3d at 525; Jermosen v.\nSmith, 945 F.2d 547, 551 (2d Cir. 1991). The Sixth Circuit has held that\na district court must find binding precedent from the Supreme Court,\nthe Sixth Circuit, or from itself. Ohio Civil Serv. Employees Ass'n v.\nSeiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1177 (6th Cir . 1988).\n\nWe have held that district court decisions do not establish the law of\nthe circuit, and are not even binding on other district courts within the\ndistrict. Threadgill v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 928 F.2d 1366, 1371\n(3d Cir. 1991). Yet, as our prior decisions have illustrated, district\ncourt\nopinions do play a role in the qualified immunity analysis. See e.g. Pro\nv. Donatucci, 81 F.3d 1283 (3d Cir . 1996) (affirming district court's\nreliance on Fifth Circuit opinion and two district court opinions to find\nclearly established right in qualified immunity analysis); cf. Brown v.\nGrabowski, 922 F.2d 1097 n.13 (3d Cir . 1990) (accepting the use of out\nof circuit and district court opinions in qualified immunity analysis but\nreversing because opinions had been render ed after conduct in\nquestion).\n\n11. The absence of circuit precedent does not mean an official will always\nretain the immunity defense. \"The easiest cases don't even arise.\" United\nStates v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                               18\n\fexpressed by the most analogous appellate holding,\ntogether with the conflict among a handful of district court\nopinions, undermines any claim that the right was clearly\nestablished in 1995.\n\nFinally, we address Doe's argument r egarding the\nsettlement in Austin v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections,\n876 F. Supp. 1437 (E.D.Pa. 1995). In Austin, the district\ncourt accepted a negotiated settlement between a class of\ninmates and the Pennsylvania Department of Corr ections\nover numerous prison conditions, including medical care.\nAs part of the settlement, the DOC agreed to keep inmates'\nmedical information regarding their HIV status confidential\nand to advocate a universal precautions policy instead of a\nnotification policy in future union negotiations. Id. at 1453.\nDoe argues that, in light of the Austin settlement, prison\nofficials could not reasonably believe that non-consensual\ndisclosures of an inmate's HIV status wer e lawful.\n\nWe agree that, in some ways, the Austin settlement is\nmore persuasive than the scattered district court opinions\npreviously discussed. Austin has significant factual\ncorrespondence to Doe's case. In addition, the opinion\ndocuments the participation of the DOC in lengthy\nnegotiations regarding treatment of HIV-positive inmates to\nsettle the class action. Cf. Buckley v. Rogerson , 133 F.3d\n1125, 1130-31 (8th Cir. 1998) (district court class action\njudgment against Missouri state prison system clearly\nestablished right for Iowa state prisoner to over come\nqualified immunity defense).\n\nNevertheless, Austin is also less persuasive than other\ndistrict court opinions. Rather than providing a decision on\nthe legal merits of the claims, the Austin court merely\napproved a settlement. As the Austin court itself noted, it\n\"only evaluate[ed] the probable outcome of the litigation\nand [was] not required to weigh and decide each\ncontention.\" Austin, 876 F. Supp. at 1464 n.16. The Austin\ncourt's statement about the constitutionality of disclosing\nan inmate's medical information was in r esponse to\nproposed, and rejected, courses of conduct.12 The legal\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. The Austin court stated: \"One gr oup of inmates objects to the\nSettlement Agreement because they believe the provisions which ensure\n\n                               19\n\fconclusion regarding the constitutional right to privacy was\ndictum. It was not binding on the parties and it certainly\ndid not clearly establish a constitutional right.\n\nNor can the fact that the DOC agreed to settle a case\nclearly establish a federal constitutional right. The law\nfavors settlement, particularly in class actions and other\ncomplex cases, to conserve judicial resour ces and reduce\nparties' costs. See In Re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck\nFuel Tank Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 784 (3d Cir.) cert. denied,\nGeneral Motors v. French, 516 U.S. 824 (1995). Where, as in\nAustin, the factual and legal issues wer e numerous, broad\nand complex, the decision to settle a case cannot be\nelevated to the recognition of a constitutional right.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the\ncited authorities, individually or in combination, clearly\nestablished an inmate's constitutional right to privacy in\nhis medical information. Government officials must stay\nabreast of constitutional developments, but they are not\n\"expected to predict the future course of constitutional\nlaw.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. at 617. We conclude that\nthe contours of defendants' legal obligations under the\nConstitution were not sufficiently clear in 1995 that a\nreasonable prison official would understand that the non-\nconsensual disclosure of a prisoner's HIV status violates\nthe Constitution. Accordingly, we will affir m the District\nCourt order granting Defendants qualified immunity from\nPlaintiff 's claims.13\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthe anonymity of HIV-infected inmates ar e too stringent. These inmates\nwant the DOC to test all inmates and notify the general population of\nthose inmates who are HIV-positive. Such a notification procedure is\nunrelated to any penological interest and would most likely violate state\nlaw . . . and the Constitution of the United States.\" Austin, 876 F. Supp.\nat 1466. With respect to the Turner factors, however, the Austin court\nstated that \"there was no assurance that this Court would order an\nelimination of the notification provision. Although individuals have an\ninterest in preventing disclosure of their HIV status which is protected\nby state law and the Constitution, inmates' rights must necessarily yield\nto a certain extent to legitimate penological inter ests.\" Id. at 1467.\n\n13. We will likewise affirm the District Court's order dismissing Nurse\nZimmerman pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for qualified\nimmunity and declining supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.\n\n                               20\n\f3.\n\nAlthough the exact boundaries of such a right have yet to\nbe established, we hold today that prison inmates r etain a\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to\nprivacy in their medical information. The exact parameters\nof a prisoner's right to privacy in that infor mation will have\nto be determined in a later case on a mor e complete record,\nwhere the Turner factors can be fully considered in the\ncontext of the penological interests concer ned. Moreover,\nbecause we are granting qualified immunity to the\ndefendants, we also do not go on to the issue of the\nstandard that is utilized to determine whether a prisoner's\nright to privacy in his medical information has been\nviolated. That determination too will have to wait for\nanother day.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe hold that the Fourteenth Amendment pr otects an\ninmate's right to medical privacy, subject to legitimate\npenological interests. However, because this right was not\nclearly established at the time of defendants' conduct, we\nwill affirm the District Court's dismissal of Doe's complaint\non the basis of qualified immunity.\n\n                               21\n\fNYGAARD, concurring and dissenting:\n\nI agree with Judge Roth's conclusion that prisoners have\na right to privacy in their medical information, and that\nthis right may be compromised only if it conflicts with a\nlegitimate penological objective that satisfies the criteria\noutlined in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254\n(1987). I would conclude, however, that Doe's right to\nprivacy in medical matters was clearly established at the\ntime of the alleged violations such that Appellees, as\nreasonable employees of the Pennsylvania Department of\nCorrections, should have known that the right existed and\ntherefore cannot be dismissed from defending these\nallegations on the basis of qualified immunity. Hence, I\ndissent from the conclusions contained in Section III, B. 2\nof Judge Roth's opinion.\n\nIt is now axiomatic that the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity bars government officials fr om liability for\ndamages unless they disobeyed \"clearly establish[ed]\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a r easonable\nperson would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738 (1982). Debates over\ndefendants' qualified immunity typically tur n on this\n\"clearly established right\" clause. The Supr eme Court has\nunpacked the meaning of Harlow by pr oviding the following\nanalytic parameters: For a right to be clearly established,\nthe \"contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right,\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635,\n640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039 (1987). Nonetheless, at the same\ntime, a court need not have ruled on a case bearing a\n\"precise factual correspondence\" with the one under\nconsideration. Assaf v. Fields, 178 F .3d. 170 (3d Cir. 1999),\ncert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 374 (1999). Thus, gover nment\nofficials are not barred from the protection of qualified\nimmunity if they fail to predict fluctuations in legal debates.\nThey will not, however, be granted immunity if they fail to\nmake obvious inferences from a generally established right,\nto its application in particular situations.\n\nThe question is whether these members of the\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections should have\nknown from 1995 through 1997 that prisoners possessed a\n\n                               22\n\fright to the privacy of their medical recor ds. I proceed to\nmy conclusion as follows:\n\nFirst, we have recognized the right to confidentiality in\nmedical records since 1980. United States v. Westinghouse\nElec. Corp., 638 F.2d 570, 577 (3d Cir . 1980). We stated in\nWestinghouse that medical recor ds, which \"may contain\nintimate facts of a personal nature, ar e well within the\nambit of materials entitled to privacy protection.\nInformation about one's body and state of health is a\nmatter which the individual is ordinarily entitled to retain\nwithin the private enclave where he may lead a private life.\"\nId. at 577 (citations omitted). Those infected with HIV are\noften subjected to discrimination, ridicule, and violence,\nand therefore by 1995 we recognized the heightened\nimportance of respecting the medical privacy of HIV\ncarriers. See Doe v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp.\nAuth., 72 F.3d 1133, 1140 (3d Cir . 1995) (noting not only\nthe importance of maintaining the privacy of medical\nrecords but also the corollary r esponsibility of maintaining\nthe confidentiality of prescriptions for medications used to\ntreat AIDS.); see also Doe v. City of New Y ork, 15 F.3d 264\n(2d Cir. 1994); Doe v. Borough of Barrington, 729 F. Supp.\n376 (D.N.J. 1990). Thus the constitutional right to privacy\nof medical information in the non-prison context was well\nestablished at the time the defendants here\"leaked\" the\ninformation about Doe.\n\nLikewise, the standard for determining the legitimacy of\nan infringement on a prisoner's constitutional right, such\nas the right to confidentiality in medical r ecords, was well\nestablished by 1995. In Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct.\nat 2257, the Supreme Court determined that any alleged\nviolation of a prisoner's right will be unwarranted unless it\nis determined to be \"reasonably r elated to legitimate\npenological interests.\" See also W ashington v. Harper, 494\nU.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (1990); O'Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 107 S.Ct. 2400 (1987); Monmouth\nCounty Corr. Inst. v. Lanzara, 834 F .2d 326, 343 (3d Cir.\n1987). Turner provided four questions to guide our analysis.\nFirst, is there a valid and rational connection between the\nregulation or activity and the legitimate gover nmental\ninterest? Second, is there an alter native means for the\n\n                               23\n\fprisoner to exercise the right? Third, will accommodating\nthe right cause an unreasonable burden on the staff, other\ninmates, or prison resources? Fourth, is there another\nobvious means to accomplish the prison's objective? The\nCourt's intention in fashioning this test was \"to formulate\na standard of review for prisoners' constitutional claims\nthat is responsive both to the policy of judicial restraint\nregarding prisoner complaints and [to] the need to protect\nconstitutional rights.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. at\n2257 (citations omitted).\n\nAlthough we have given \"[p]rison officials . . . broad\ndiscretion in fashioning appropriate r esponses to legitimate\npenological objectives consistent with the constitutional\nrights of inmates,\" Monmouth County, 834 F.2d at 343,\nTurner demands that the responses at issue reasonably\nserve a valid penological interest. The courts must not,\ntherefore, allow our analysis to be obscur ed by bald\nassertions from prison officials who claim that the policy in\nquestion serves a legitimate end. Expressing some\nfrustration that the Turner standar d was being misapplied,\nthe Supreme Court restated its purpose and application in\nWashington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (1990).\n\"We made quite clear,\" Justice Kennedy admonished, \"that\nthe standard of review we adopted in Turner applies to all\ncircumstances in which the needs of prison administration\nimplicate constitutional rights.\" Id. at 223, 110 S.Ct. at\n1038.\n\nWell before 1995, therefore, officials for the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections should have known 1) that a\nconstitutional right to privacy in medical r ecords exists,\nparticularly for HIV-related infor mation, and 2) that under\nTurner, prisoners do not forfeit constitutional rights except\nwhen those rights cannot reasonably be r econciled with\nlegitimate penological objectives. With these two premises\nwell known, I would expect reasonable prison officials to\ninfer that they cannot arbitrarily violate a prisoner's right to\nprivacy in medical information. In this situation, the\n\"contours of the right [were] sufficiently clear\" for Appellees\nto understand that they were violating Doe's\nconstitutionally protected right. Anderson , 483 U.S. at 640,\n107 S.Ct. at 3039.\n\n                               24\n\fNext, I believe that a \"consensus of cases of persuasive\nauthority\" had been established by 1995. W ilson v. Lane,\n526 U.S. 603, 616, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1700 (1999). The\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals had pr esumed the\nexistence of the right to privacy in HIV-r elated medical\ninformation for prisoners by 1991. See Harris v. Thigpen,\n941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir. 1991). Likewise, in 1992 the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit r eviewed segregation\nof HIV-positive inmates under the Tur ner test, finding that\nthe identification and segregation of HIV -positive prisoners\n\"obviously serves a legitimate penological inter est,\" and\nthereby acknowledging the existence of a prisoner's right to\nprivacy in medical information that can only be abrogated\nby a legitimate penological objective. Moor e v. Mabus, 976\nF.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\nIn 1993, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that\ninmates have a constitutionally protected privacy interest in\nnondisclosure of confidential medical infor mation\nconcerning their HIV status. Faison v. Parker, 823 F. Supp.\n1198 (E.D. Pa. 1993). Although the court recognized this\nright, it ultimately held that the disclosur e of such\ninformation in a presentencing report served the state's\ncompelling and countervailing interest of utilizing this\nknowledge to provide an appropriate sentence and care\nregimen. The balance of interests favor ed disclosure\nbecause the medical information was not included in the\npublic record, was treated as confidential, and was\nprovided only to the appropriate officials. Thus, by 1993 the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania recognized the right to\nprivacy in inmates' HIV-related medical information and\nfurther understood that this right could be compr omised\nonly by the need to meet a compelling and incompatible\ngovernment interest. The Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nreinforced this ruling in Austin v. Pennsylvania Dept. of\nCorr., 876 F. Supp. 1437 (E.D. Pa. 1995), which I will\ndiscuss in more detail below.\n\nA series of other District Courts reached the same\nconclusion by 1995. Clarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F. Supp.\n1019, 1041 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (\"Prison inmates retain a\nconstitutional right to privacy concerning medical\ninformation about them.\"); Nolley v. County of Erie, 802 F.\n\n                               25\n\fSupp. 898 (W.D.N.Y. 1992); Inmates of N.Y. State with\nHuman Immune Deficiency Virus v. Cuomo, No. 90-CV-252,\n1991 WL 16032, *3 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 1991)(\"[T]he federal\nConstitution protects against the unwarranted and\nindiscriminate disclosure of the identity of HIV-infected\nindividuals and of their medical records; that is to say, the\ncourt accepts . . . the proposition that the constitutional\nright of privacy extends to such matters, and that prisoners\nenjoy such a privacy right. . . .\"); Bor ough of Barrington,\n729 F.Supp. at 384 (\"The government's interest in\ndisclosure here does not outweigh the substantial privacy\ninterest involved. The government has not shown a\ncompelling state interest in breaching the Does' privacy.\");\nWoods v. White, 689 F. Supp. 874 (W.D. Wis. 1988), aff 'd\nwithout opinion, 899 F.2d 17 (7th Cir . 1990);1 Rodriguez v.\nCoughlin, No. 87 Civ. 1577E, 1989 WL 59607 (W .D.N.Y.\nJune 2, 1989); Doe v. Coughlin, 697 F . Supp. 1234, 1238\n(N.D.N.Y. 1988) (\"[I]n recognition of the particularly\npersonal nature of the information potentially subject to\ndisclosure under the state's program, the court determines\nthat the prisoners subject to this program must be afforded\nat least some protection against the non-consensual\ndisclosure of their diagnosis.\")\n\nAppellees argue, and Judge Roth agrees, that these cases\ndo not constitute a proper consensus. T o the contrary, I\nagree with the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nwhich explained that \"[i]n the absence of binding precedent,\na court should look to all available decisional law, including\ndecisions of state courts, other circuits and district courts.\"\nNorfleet v. Arkansas Dep't of Human Services , 989 F.2d\n289, 291 (8th Cir. 1993); see also Buckley v. Rogerson, 133\nF.3d 1125, 1129-30 (8th Cir. 1998) (finding a right clearly\nestablished on the basis of decisions from out of circuit\ndistrict courts). We should remember that the Supreme\nCourt has recently made clear that all that is required to\ndefeat claims of qualified immunity is a \"consensus of cases\nof persuasive authority,\" and not a consensus of binding\nauthority. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 616. Thus although a lone\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Judge Roth states that the Seventh Circuit \"rejected\" Woodsin\nAnderson v. Romero, 72, F.3d 518 (7th Cir. 1995). This is not entirely\naccurate. The court in Anderson merely declined to reach the question.\n\n                               26\n\fDistrict Court opinion may not secure a right, when that\nopinion is combined with opinions from the Supr eme Court,\nCourts of Appeals, and a variety of District Courts, then I\nwould conclude that the right was established to an extent\nsufficient to notify the officials.\n\nTwo other factors render the officials' failure to recognize\nDoe's right to privacy in his medical recor ds still more\nunreasonable. First, The Pennsylvania Confidentiality of\nHIV-Related Information Act, 35 P .S. S 7603, which became\neffective on March 1, 1991, provides a statutory right to\nnondisclosure. Section 7607 states:\n\n       (a) Limitations on disclosure.--No person or employee,\n       or agent of such person, who obtains confidential HIV-\n       related information in the course of pr oviding any\n       health or social service or pursuant to a release of\n       confidential HIV-related information under subsection\n       (c) may disclose or be compelled to disclose the\n       information.\n\nThe statute makes no exception for inmates, as it states\nthat HIV-related information can be disclosed to\n\n       [e]mployees of county mental health/mental\n       retardation agencies, county childr en and youth\n       agencies, county juvenile probation departments,\n       county or State facilities for delinquent youth, and\n       contracted residential providers of the above-named\n       entities receiving or contemplating residential\n       placement of the subject, who:\n\n        (i) generally are authorized to receive medical\n       information; and\n\n        (ii) are responsible for ensuring that the subject\n       receives appropriate health care; and\n\n        (iii) have a need to know the HIV-r elated information\n       in order to ensure such care is pr ovided.\n\nId. Because no exception is made for adult prisoners, and\nall other exceptions are clearly stated, the Department of\nCorrections should have known by March 1991 that\nprisoners possess a right to the privacy of their HIV-related\ninformation. Considering the specificity of the statute, and\n\n                               27\n\fits precise applicability to the facts of this case, the right\nunder review was clearly established in 1991.\n\nAppellees, and Judge Roth, claim that a state statute is\nirrelevant to the issue of qualified immunity on a federal\nclaim. See Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194-97, 104\nS.Ct. 3012, 3019-21 (1984). I disagree. As the Supreme\ncourt explained in Elder v. Halloway, Davis held that\n\n       an official's clear violation of a state administrative\n       regulation does not allow a S 1983 plaintiff to overcome\n       the official's qualified immunity. Only in this context is\n       the Court's statement comprehensible: `A plaintiff who\n       seeks damages for violation of constitutional or\n       statutory rights may overcome the appellee official's\n       qualified immunity only by showing that those rights\n       were clearly established . . .' Davis, in short, concerned\n       not the authorities a court may consider in\n       determining qualified immunity, but this entirely\n       discrete question: Is qualified immunity defeated where\n       an appellee violates any clearly established duty,\n       including one under state law, or must the clearly\n       established right be the federal right on which the\n       claim for relief is based? The Court held the latter.\n\n510 U.S. 510, 515, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023 (1994) (citations\nomitted).\n\nThe reason why I disagree with Judge Roth is that\nalthough a state statute will not, by itself, place an official\non notice of a federal right, to me such a statutory right\nshould raise the official's awareness that a parallel federal\nright may exist. Such a warning should facilitate a\nreasonable official's ability to make the inference discussed\nabove. This position is congruent with the objectives of the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity. If a state statute clearly\narticulates a right, and places those within its jurisdiction\non notice of that right, and if that right per fectly coincides\nwith a federally protected right, then why would we not\nconsider the statute's existence when determining whether\nthe offender should have known of the federal right? I think\nwe should. Indeed it seems to me that a state statute,\nlocally promulgated, and free from many of the\nuncertainties of case law, most effectively notifies the\ncommunity of a protected right, and reinforces federal law.\n\n                                28\n\fRegardless of how a person learned of the right, and\nregardless of whether she thought she was violating state\nor federal law, she knew that a right existed and that she\nwas violating it. The purpose of qualified immunity is to\nprotect government officials fr om having to defend\nthemselves in litigation over rights and duties that they did\nnot know they were violating. Here, the Appellees were\nclearly notified by the 1991 statute that Doe was entitled to\nthe privacy of his medical records under state law. The\ninference that prisoners were entitled to the same right\nunder federal law was implicit by 1995. If we allow the state\nstatute to play no role in assessing whether or not the\nofficials should have known of the federal right, then we\nallow officials to turn a blind eye to the general state of the\nlaw and discourage them from making a good faith effort to\nrecognize such implicit principles. I consider this good faith\neffort to be within the responsibilities of a \"reasonable\nofficial.\"\n\nIn addition, as powerful evidence that these officials\nknew they were violating Doe's right to privacy, in an\nopinion establishing a right to privacy for inmates' HIV-\nrelated medical records, Austin v. Pennsylvanian Dep't of\nCorr., the very agency and officials before us now were also\nappellees in that case. In that opinion in January 1995, the\nCourt stated that the \"DOC has agreed to keep inmates'\nmedical information regarding HIV status confidential and\nto advocate a universal precautions policy in place of the\ncurrent Contagious Disease Notification Policy in its\nforthcoming negotiations with the union repr esentative of\nits custody staff.\" Austin, 876 F . Supp. at 1453. This\ndecision alone directly notified Appellees of their obligation\nto protect Doe's privacy right. As Judge Roth correctly\nstates, court approval of a settlement does not provide a\nlegal decision regarding the constitutionality of the\nelements of the settlement. But that is not the test. The\ncourt clearly warned the very institution before us in this\nmatter that it risked constitutional violations by disclosure.\nIndeed the language the Court used was that disclosure of\na prisoner's HIV-related medical infor mation, if \"unrelated\nto any penological interest . . . would most likely violate\nstate law, and the Constitution of the United States.\" Id. at\n1437. Austin explained that \"[a]lthough individuals have an\n\n                               29\n\finterest in preventing disclosure of their HIV status which\nis protected by state law and the Constitution, inmates'\nrights must necessarily yield to a certain extent to\nlegitimate penological interests,\" and then clearly stated the\ncriterion of the Turner test. Id. In light of this notification,\nit seems disingenuous to claim that the officials here\ndeserve protection from Doe's claims because they did not\nknow that they could not arbitrarily disclose a prisoner's\nmedical information.2\n\n       In summary, the combination of the preponderance of\ncase law, the state statute, and the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections' previous agr eement to respect\nprivacy in prisoners' HIV-related materials, clearly\nestablished the right in question. I would find that, taken\ntogether, these factors defeat Appellees' claim to qualified\nimmunity. I therefore respectfully dissent from this aspect\nof the Majority's decision.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Finally, I note that the manner in which this delicate information was\ndisseminated indicates to me that the officials knew they were\nmisbehaving, but persisted in doing so regar dless of the fact that they\nwere mistreating Doe.\n\n                               30\n\fGARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting and concurring.\n\nI agree with Judge Roth that the District Court's decision\ndismissing Doe's complaint should be affir med because the\ndefendants have qualified immunity from Doe's claims.\nHowever, I cannot agree that, on this r ecord brought before\nus on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,1 we can or should declare\nthat \"a constitutional right to privacy in one's medical\ninformation exists in prison.\" (Roth Op. at 11.) This case is\none of first impression, and Judge Roth's holding, with\nwhich Judge Nygaard concurs as to the constitutional right,2\nmay have a multitude of ramifications in this Cir cuit where\nmajor prisons abound. It is for that reason that I write\nseparately contesting the creation of a constitutional right\nof privacy and confidentiality for prisoners. 3\n\nIt is true that, in so holding, Judge Roth qualifies this\nstatement, observing that \"Doe's constitutional right is\nsubject to substantial restrictions and limitations in order\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A motion brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\nis granted only if: \"taking the allegations of the complaint as true, . .\n.\nand viewing them liberally giving plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences\nwhich fairly may be drawn therefrom, . . .`it appears beyond doubt that\nthe plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim\nwhich\nwould entitle [them] to relief.' \"Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d\n434,\n444 (3d Cir. 1977) (internal citations omitted).\n\n2. For ease of reference, I will r efer to Judge Roth's holding throughout\nthis dissent and concurrence, although Judge Nygaard constitutes her\nmajority with respect to the establishment of a constitutional right to\nprivacy in prison.\n\n3. In her footnote 3, relevant to her discussion of mootness, (see Roth\nOp., Part III.A), Judge Roth asserts that S 1997e(e) of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") does not bar claims for punitive damages,\nrelying on Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F .3d 247, 251 (3d Cir. 2000). I\ndisagree with her analysis, because I believe that this case is far more\nsimilar to Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342 (D.C.Cir. 1998),\nwhere the D.C. Circuit held that an inmate's punitive damages claims\nwere barred by the PLRA. We distinguished Davis in Allah \"because\nthose claims [in Davis] stemmed fr om the allegations of emotional and\nmental injury [suffered as a r esult of the violation of Davis'\nconstitutional\nright to privacy].\" 226 F.3d at 252. As a consequence, contrary to Judge\nRoth, I would hold that Doe's punitive damages claim is barred by the\nPLRA, although I agree that the claim for nominal damages prevents our\ndismissing Doe's action as moot.\n\f31\n\ffor correctional officers to achieve legitimate correctional\ngoals and maintain institutional security.\" (Roth Op. at 11.)\nNevertheless, because she and I agree that such a\nconstitutional right of privacy in prison has not been and is\nnot clearly established, the prudential and wiser course of\naction in this case is to decline to determine that such a\nconstitutional right has been established at all .\n\nI.\n\nThe record before us in this case is naked of anything\nother than Doe's allegations in his complaint--allegations\nwhich complain of a lack of privacy and confidentiality as\nwell as a violation of his grievance/appeal rights. 4 However,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. That statement of Doe's claim alleges:\n\n       - Doe is a death row prisoner;\n\n       - After submitting to a blood test, Doe was informed by the prison\n       medical staff that he was HIV-positive and that this medical\n       condition would be kept confidential;\n\n       - He has undergone medical examinations and tests in the open\n       presence of correctional officers and other inmates;\n\n       - The clinic door is kept open when Doe is seen by doctors and\n       specialists from the Centers for Disease Contr ol (CDC), so that\n       correctional officers can see Doe;\n\n       - When Doe has an appointment with a CDC specialist, the\n       correctional officers who escort him to the appointment are\n       informed of the nature of the appointment;\n\n       - On one occasion, a nurse announced aloud the names of the\n       medications being delivered to Doe in the pr esence of other\n       inmates and that nurse told a corrections officer about Doe's\n       condition;\n\n       - In connection with Doe's internal grievance about the sick call\n       procedure, he was interviewed by a medical grievance officer\n       whom Doe told that another inmate twice over heard a nurse\n       stating the name of Doe's medication when delivering it to him;\n\n       - Doe's internal grievance, which contained information about his\n       HIV-positive status, was forwarded to the superintendent of the\n       prison;\n\n                               32\n\fwe have not been informed and do not know whether Doe,\nwho was a death penalty prisoner, was r equired to be\nclosely guarded at all times by prison guar ds, thereby\nvirtually ensuring that the guards would be privy even to\nprivate conversations. We do not know the construction and\ndimensions of the medical area or medication dispensary at\nSCI-Pittsburgh--whether there ar e communal examination\nrooms or private examination cubicles. W e do not know the\nlocation of Doe's death penalty cell in the Restricted\nHousing Unit (\"RHU\"), or the route, access, and distance\nfrom his cell to the medical area. W e do not know the\ncircumstances under which medication is dispensed at sick\ncall--the structure and configuration of the dispensary, the\nlocation in the dispensary of physicians, nurses, guards,\nand other prisoners, or the manner in which prisoners\nreceive medication (are they separately scheduled or are\nthey scheduled in a group or in an open line?). Nor do we\nknow the administrative complexities encounter ed by\nprison authorities in ensuring the manner in which each\nprisoner receives the correct medication. We do not know\nthe state of the security precautions in the dispensary area\nas compared to the security in the RHU, nor do we know\nthe required provisions for security in the passageways\nbetween the two areas.\n\nAll that we do know from Doe's complaint is 1) that the\nclinic door is kept open when Doe is seen by doctors and\nCDC specialists so that Doe may be viewed by corr ections\nofficers,5 and 2) that, when Doe receives his medication, the\nmedication is sometimes referred to by name. Moreover,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       - Prison officials responded to Doe's internal grievance by\n       informing him that the nurses denied his allegations and that the\n       door had to be left open when Doe was being examined by\n       specialists and doctors due to a \"security issue\"; and\n\n       - His appeal rights had been affected by being obliged to go\n       through the superintendent prior to appeal tofinal review.\n\n(App. 15a-19a.)\n\n5. Judge Roth acknowledges that Doe has conceded that this practice\nmay be justified by the prison's legitimate security concerns. (Roth Op.\nat 12.)\n\n                               33\n\fbecause, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, no response or\ninformation is available from, in this case, the prison\nauthorities, we have no knowledge of the physical,\nstructural, or security conditions in prison that contribute\nto and may generate a diminished expectation of privacy or\nconfidentiality.6\n\nPrisons are communal environments in which a large\nnumber of inmates and prison employees coexist in a\nconfined living space. For this reason, inmates have little\nphysical privacy, and the circumstances of medical\ntreatment may not conform to private, non-prison norms.\nPrisoners must do everything in close proximity to other\ninmates and prison personnel, including sleeping, eating,\ndressing, bathing, and, to a certain extent, r eceiving\nmedical attention.\n\nII.\n\nAnother reality of prison life is the fact that prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Because, as noted, this is an appeal fr om a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,\nthe defendants have not been able to inform us of their actions,\nprocedures, regulations, explanations, or justifications in response to\nDoe's complaint. (See text infra, discussing the inadvisability of\ncreating\nconstitutional rights based on a naked recor d consisting only of the\nprisoner-plaintiff 's allegations.) It is not only impossible to analyze\nthe\nfactors identified in Turner (connection between regulation and\njustification; alternative means of exer cising right; costs of\naccommodating right; and alternatives to the r egulation), as even Judge\nRoth acknowledges (see Roth Op. at 12 (\"defendants did not have the\nopportunity to [produce] any evidence of legitimate penological interests,\ncosts. . . , or availability of alternatives. . .\")), but it is similarly\nhopeless\nto draw upon instruction from the \"privacy?\" cases cited by both Judge\nRoth and Judge Nygaard. This is so because, her e, there are no factual\ncircumstances that can be likened or compar ed to the circumstances\ndescribed in the cases my colleagues have cited, almost all of which are\nnon-prison cases or are inapposite for some other reason and, therefore,\nare not relevant in any event. See, e.g., Doe v. Southeastern Pennsylvania\nTransp. Auth., 72 F3d 1133 (3d Cir . 1995) (non-prison case); United\nStates v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 638 F .2d 570 (3d Cir. 1980) (non-\nprison case); Moore v. Mabus, 976 F .2d 268 (5th Cir. 1992) (does not\nestablish privacy right); Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir.\n1991) (does not establish privacy right).\n\n                               34\n\fresources are limited. Prison systems are generally in this\nday and age overcrowded and understaf fed. Therefore,\naccommodation of prisoners' privacy and confidentiality\ndemands, their needs, and even their rights cannot be\nassumed or declared in a vacuum. Considering the\ncommunal nature of prison existence, similar in many\nprivacy (or lack of privacy) aspects to life in the military,\ntogether with the limited and often insufficientfinancial\nresources of prisons, I believe it to be rash and imprudent\nto hold at this time, without much more infor mation about\nprison security concerns, that Doe has a constitutional\nright to privacy in his HIV-positive status, any more than\nhe has a constitutional right of privacy in his cell. See\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 525-26 (1984).\n\nI recognize, of course, that the rationale of Hudson,\nanalyzed under the Fourth Amendment, dealt with the lack\nof privacy an inmate has in his cell accommodation,\nwhereas here our attention is drawn to rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment and the \"penumbras\" of rights\nencompassing privacy. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\nU.S. 479, 484 (1965) (holding that \"specific guarantees in\nthe Bill of Rights have penumbras,\" one of which is the\nright of privacy). However, certainly Doe's expectation of\nprivacy and confidentiality of medical infor mation in a\ncommunal dispensary setting cannot be deemed to be\ngreater than his expectation of privacy in his cell,\ndepending, of course, on all of the circumstances which I\nhave noted above and as to which we have no infor mation.\n\nIndeed, I take issue with Judge Roth's assertion that\n\"Doe's asserted right to privacy in his medical information\nis completely different than the right extinguished in\nHudson.\" (Roth Op. at 10.) After all, in Hudson, the\nSupreme Court declined to declare a constitutional right\nbecause \"[t]he recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in\ntheir individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the\nconcept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of\npenal institutions,\" 468 U.S. at 526, wher eas, here, Judge\nRoth has declared a constitutional right, but has held that\n\"Doe's constitutional right is subject to substantial\nrestrictions and limitations in order for correctional officials\nto achieve legitimate correctional goals and maintain\n\n                                35\n\finstitutional security.\" (Roth Op. at 11.) If there are\nconcerns, as evidently Judge Roth has her e, that\n\"legitimate correctional goals\" and \"institutional security\"\nmay be jeopardized by the exercise of Doe's purported\nconstitutional right, it would seem to me only prudent that\nwe should withhold declaring a constitutional right of\nprivacy until we have obtained the information we lack.\n\nThat is the course of action that the Supreme Court took\nin Hudson, where the Court decided the very limited\nquestion of a prisoner's Fourth Amendment privacy right in\nhis cell on an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,\nnot a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion, and\neven Powell v. Schriver, 175 F.3d 107 (2d Cir. 1999), which\nJudge Roth cites in support of her declared constitutional\nright, went to full trial before the Second Cir cuit announced\nthat a constitutional right had been established.\n\nI believe that we can analogize Doe's situation to the\nSupreme Court's rationale in Hudson, where the Court, as\nnoted, held that prisoners do not have a Fourth\nAmendment right to privacy in their cells. Doe's complaint\nincludes claims of violation of his privacy, violation of\nconfidentiality, and violation of his rights under the\ngrievances and appeal procedures. My r eading of Doe's\ncomplaint reveals that it is the privacy aspect on which Doe\nhas focused and which has caused his distress. But, the\nquestion that then arises is whether Doe had a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy concerning his HIV -positive status.\nIn this respect, I believe we can look to Hudson, where the\nCourt stated:\n\n       Determining whether an expectation of privacy is\n       \"legitimate\" or \"reasonable\" necessarily entails a\n       balancing of interests. The two inter ests here are the\n       interest of society in the security of its penal\n       institutions and the interest of the prisoner in privacy\n       within his cell. The latter interest, of course, is already\n       limited by the exigencies of the circumstances: A prison\n       \"shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home, an\n       automobile, an office, or a hotel room.\" We strike the\n       balance in favor of institutional security, which we\n       have noted is \"central to all other corrections goals.\" A\n       right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms\n\n                               36\n\f       is fundamentally incompatible with the close and\n       continual surveillance of inmates and their cells r equired\n       to ensure institutional security and inter nal order. We\n       are satisfied that society would insist that the\n       prisoner's expectation of privacy always yield to what\n       must be considered the paramount interest in\n       institutional security. We believe that it is accepted by\n       our society that \"[l]oss of freedom of choice and privacy\n       are inherent incidents of confinement.\"\n\nHudson, 468 U.S. at 527-28 (internal citations omitted)\n(emphasis added). So too is the privacy inter est implicated\nin this case \"limited by the exigencies of the\ncircumstances,\" namely the communal natur e of prison life,\nthe logistical problems with prisoner confidentiality in\nprison medical facilities, and the need for prisoners,\nespecially death row prisoners such as Doe, to be watched\nclosely by prison guards. Therefor e, I believe that,\ndepending upon the prison information as to which we are\nstill ignorant, Doe's right to privacy in the communication\nof his medical information may be \"fundamentally\nincompatible with the close and continual surveillance of\ninmates\" as was the Fourth Amendment right in Hudson.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. I should note that the connection between the prison's security\ninterest and the deprivation of Doe's right to privacy is less direct here\nthan in the Fourth Amendment context. In Hudson , the Supreme Court\nobserved that prison officials must be able to maintain prison safety by\nentering inmate's cells to search for weapons and contraband. Here,\nDoe's right to privacy is overshadowed and diminished by the general\nneed to monitor and guard prisoners and by the very nature of a forced\ncommunal living environment, both of which make it difficult to preserve\na prisoner's privacy.\n\nMoreover, I believe that the balancing of interests prescribed by the\nSupreme Court in Hudson whereby expectations of privacy must be\nbalanced against legitimate penological and security interests cannot be\nundertaken unless and until those interests ar e known and spread upon\nthe record. Until that time, I cannot subscribe to or hold that prisoners\nhave the same privacy interests as the general non-prison population\nenjoys. I also believe that, when the balancing equation is completed, it\nwill weigh in favor of institutional security and against prisoners'\nunrealistic expectations of privacy as it does in the Fourth Amendment\ncontext.\n\n                               37\n\fSee Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974) (\"challenges\nto prison restrictions that are asserted to inhibit First\nAmendment interests must be analyzed in ter ms of the\nlegitimate policies and goals of the corrections system, to\nwhose custody and care the prisoner has been committed\nin accordance with due process of law\").\n\nThus, the realities of prison life compel a holding that\nDoe has not established a constitutional right to privacy on\nthe record here--and certainly not in the current posture of\nthis case. Though the Supreme Court has held that\nprisoners retain \"those [constitutional] rights not\nfundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment itself or\nincompatible with the objectives of incarceration,\" Hudson\nv. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 523 (1984), the Court has also\nobserved repeatedly that \"[l]awful incar ceration brings\nabout the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many\nprivileges and rights, a retraction justified by the\nconsiderations underlying our penal system.\" 8 Price v.\nJohnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285 (1948). These \"considerations\"\ninclude \"deterrence of crime, rehabilitation of prisoners,\nand institutional security,\" DeHart v. Hor n, 227 F.3d 47, 50\n(3d Cir. 2000), as well as, I believe, allocation of limited\nprison resources. Indeed, the Supr eme Court has stated:\n\"because the `problems of prisons in America are complex\nand intractable,' and because courts are particularly `ill\nequipped' to deal with these problems, we generally have\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nHence, I am neither influenced nor persuaded by Judge Roth's reliance\non Powell v. Schriver, 175 F.3d 107 (2d Cir. 1999), a Second Circuit case\nnot binding in this Circuit and completely distinguishable because: 1)\nPowell was decided only after a full jury trial, whereas here we have a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion which takes the allegations of the complaint as\ntrue, see note 1, supra; 2) Powell extrapolated its privacy holding from\nDoe v. City of New York, 15 F.3d 264 (2d Cir. 1994), which is a non-\nprison case of privacy; and 3) Powell's emphasis was wholly on\ntranssexualism--a condition with its unique pr oblems not relevant in\nDoe's case.\n\n8. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle most recently in Shaw v.\nMurphy, stating that \"constitutional rights that prisoners possess are\nmore limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals\nin society at large.\" 121 S.Ct. 1475, 1479 (2001).\n\n                               38\n\fdeferred to the judgments of prison officials in upholding\nthese regulations against constitutional challenge.\" Shaw v.\nMurphy, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 1480 (2001) (inter nal citations\nomitted) (holding that a prisoner has no First Amendment\nright to provide legal assistance to other inmates and that,\ntherefore, prison officials did not violate the prisoner's\nconstitutional rights when they intercepted a letter\ncontaining legal advice that he sent to another prisoner).\n\nIII.\n\nI also note that a decision in this case that 1) the record\nis not sufficient to establish a constitutional right but that\n2) the right was not clearly established in any event is\nconsistent with the Supreme Court's dir ective in Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603 (1999). In Wilson , the Court stated\nthat \"[a] court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity\n`must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the\ndeprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so,\nproceed to determine whether that right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.' \" 526 U.S.\n603, 609 (1999) (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286,\n290 (1999)). The Court explained that \"[d]eciding the\nconstitutional question before addressing the qualified\nimmunity question . . . promotes clarity in the legal\nstandards for official conduct, to the benefit of both the\nofficers and the general public.\" 526 U.S. at 609.\n\nHowever, Wilson arose in the context of a district court's\nruling on a summary judgment motion, not on a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, as did the other cases cited by\nthe Court in Wilson. See Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286\n(1999); County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833\n(1998); see also Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226 (1991).9 This\ndoctrine makes sense in the context of a summary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Powell v. Schriver, see note 5, supra, in which the Second Circuit held\nthat a transsexual prisoner had a constitutional right to privacy in that\nmedical information but that the constitutional right to privacy in prison\nwas not clearly established, arose in the context of a district court's\ngrant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the defendant. In that\ncase, unlike this one, the Second Circuit had the benefit of a full\nfactual\nrecord after a full jury trial.\n\n                               39\n\fjudgment motion, which occurs at the close of discovery\nwhen a court may make a decision on the existence of a\nconstitutional right with the benefit of the r elevant facts.\n\nHence, it seems to me that the Wilson rule is not\nappropriately extended to rulings on Rule 12(b)(6) motions\nto dismiss, where the factual recor d is as scant as it is\nhere. In my opinion, to construct a constitutional right out\nof the whole cloth without analysis and without any\nknowledge of the institutional factors or security concerns\nattendant to a prison population or to a penal envir onment\nappears to me to be not only improvident but, as I have\nstated, rash. Indeed, I find it highly unusual that a court\nshould decide the existence of a constitutional right when\nit has essentially no record befor e it and no basis on which\nit may balance the claims made by the prisoner of privacy\nexpectations against legitimate security inter ests of the\nprison. Such a decision does not \"promote[ ] clarity in the\nlegal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both\nthe officers and the general public,\" W ilson, 526 U.S. at\n609, but instead causes uncertainty and confusion by\nestablishing an hitherto undeclared constitutional right\nwith no discernable standards.\n\nJudge Roth in her majority opinion has responded to this\ncritique and my thesis by citing two Supreme Court cases\nand declaring that the Supreme Court unequivocally\ndemands that, in qualified immunity cases, the\nconstitutional right first be declared befor e we address\nwhether that right has been clearly established. (Roth Op.\nat 8 n.4.) I quite agree with her that the doctrine she\ninvokes requires the declaration of a constitutional right as\nthe first order of business. However, and this is a major\n\"however,\" those cases to which she r efers were not cases\ndecided by a district court on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 608 (1999) (\"The District\nCourt denied respondents' motion for summary judgment\non the basis of qualified immunity.\"); Conn v. Gabbert, 526\nU.S. 286, 289 (1999) (\"[Defendants] moved for summary\njudgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the\nDistrict Court granted the motion.\"). The very nature of a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion, as contrasted with a summary\njudgment motion, with its concomitant standar d of review\n\n                               40\n\f(accepting all of the plaintiff 's allegations as true), is alien\nto certain types of judicial declarations (namely,\ndeclarations of constitutional rights).\n\nThe Seventh Circuit, albeit in a differ ent context, has\nrecently held that district court judges should not apply the\nRule 12(b)(6) standard of accepting a plaintif f 's allegations\nas true when they determine whether to certify a class. The\nSeventh Circuit instructed that, \"[b]efore deciding whether\nto allow a case to proceed as a class action, .. . a judge\nshould make whatever factual and legal inquiries ar e\nnecessary under Rule 23.\" Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines,\nInc., 249 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2001). Similarly, I suggest that\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) standard cannot be applied by district\ncourts in first determining the existence of a constitutional\nright, because the facts and circumstances of the case, as\nthey bear upon penological interests and concer ns, must be\nexplored before a court can unequivocally announce a\nconstitutional right.\n\nMoreover, I have great difficulty, as I envisage the bench\nand bar will also have, in identifying the contours and\nparameters of an asserted constitutional right of prison\nprivacy that is still subject to the restrictions and\nlimitations of penal security interests. Even Judge Roth\nadmits that these restrictions, limitations, and\naccommodations have yet to be delineated. In particular,\nsince the relevant penological interests are presently not\nknown and may, by their very nature, cause the\nconstitutional right at issue here to disappear into thin air\nor be diminished to a point of nothingness, it seems to me\nfar better that we know precisely the right with which we\nare dealing before creating such a right liable to be\ndismissed on its first documented challenge.\n\nCertainly the Supreme Court could never have intended\nthat a fundamental constitutional right be cr eated with no\nregard for the framework or circumstances relevant to its\napplication. It is for that reason, I suggest and strongly\nurge, that it is far more prudent and r esponsible to await\nthe development of an appropriate recor d before plunging\nahead to create a fundamental right which may not ever be\nsustainable in a communal prison context.\n\n                               41\n\fJudge Roth acknowledges that the record in this case is\nundeveloped just as Doe himself \"concedes that the `open\ndoor' examination room policy [see note 3, supra] could\nconceivably be justified by a legitimate security interest but\ncontends that no such interest has been advanced here.\"\n(Roth Op. at 12.) Judge Roth, recognizing that we would\nordinarily remand for consideration by the trial court of\nissues concerning legitimate penological inter ests, security\nconcerns, costs of accommodating Doe's privacy interest,\navailability of alternatives, etc., did not take that course\nbecause the right which she has declared was not clearly\nestablished.\n\nI would hold that, if a record is undeveloped, as this one\nis, it cannot suffice to form the basis for the declaration of\na constitutional right. The announcement of a\nconstitutional right--an announcement which is never\nlightly reached and which inevitably has far -reaching and\nunpredictable consequences--should be gr ounded on\nunassailable legal principles and formulated based on a full\nfactual record. Had Judge Roth just assumed arguendo\nthat a constitutional right existed in prison, as the Eleventh\nCircuit did in Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F .2d 1495, 1513 (11th\nCir. 1991), (which was admittedly decided before the\nSupreme Court's holding in Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603\n(1999)), while I would have been uncomfortable, I would not\nhave resisted her announcement as I have. But, to\nannounce without reservation a full-fledged constitutional\nright of privacy in prison, as a matter of first impression,\nwithout a factual record, and without any substantial or\npersuasive case support, I believe transcends our r ole as\nreviewing judges. I think the declaration made in this case\nis wrong and is a grave mistake to publish as this Circuit's\nprecedent. I think that we will ultimatelyfind it necessary\nto retreat from the constitutional position this panel has\ntaken.\n\nIV.\n\nAccordingly, in my opinion, we are corr ect in disposing of\nthis case on qualified immunity grounds, not only because\nthe constitutional right was not clearly established but\nbecause, at this time and in the posture of the present\n\n                               42\n\fcase, we should not announce a constitutional right which\ncannot be defined at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nI therefore respectfully dissent fr om Judge Roth's\nconstitutional holding but concur in the final judgment,\nbecause I agree with Judge Roth that such a right has not\nbeen, and is not, clearly established and that, ther efore, the\nDistrict Court's dismissal of Doe's action should be\naffirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               43\n\f",

He was\ninformed by the medical staff at the State Correctional\nInstitution at Pittsburgh (SCIP) that his medical condition\nwould be kept confidential. However, because of certain\npractices permitted by prison officials, Doe's condition was\nnot kept confidential. Doe sued under 42 U.S.C.S 1983,\nclaiming that prison practices violated his right to medical\nprivacy under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the\nPennsylvania Confidentiality of HIV-Related Information\nAct, 35 P.S. S 7601 et seq. The District Court granted\ndefendants' motions to dismiss the S 1983 claims on the\nbasis of qualified immunity, declined jurisdiction over the\nstate claims, and dismissed the case.\n\nAlthough we ultimately agree that defendants ar e entitled\nto qualified immunity, we do not agree with the District\n\n                                  2\n\fCourt's reasoning. We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment\nprotects an inmate's right to medical privacy, subject to\nlegitimate penological interests. However , because this right\nwas not clearly established at the time of defendants'\nconduct, we will affirm the dismissal of Doe's complaint.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nJohn Doe arrived at SCIP on January 11, 1995. Shortly\nthereafter, Doe was informed by the medical staff that he\nwas HIV-positive. After signing a written consent of\ndisclosure form, he was told that his medical condition\nwould be kept confidential and that medical r ecords\nrelating to his illness would be maintained separately from\nhis general prison file.\n\nBecause of certain procedures permitted by defendants,\nDoe's condition was not kept confidential. Specifically,\nwhen Doe was taken for sick call appointments, staf f\ninformed the escorting officers of Doe's medical condition.\nDuring physician visits, staff kept the door to the clinic\nroom open, allowing officers, inmates, and guards in the\narea to see and hear Doe and the treating physician.\nFinally, while administering medication, nurses announced\nhis medication loudly enough for others to hear , allowing\ninmates to infer Doe's condition. Doe filed administrative\ngrievances concerning the sick call and medication\ndistribution practices, but the grievances did not bring\nabout any change in the practices.\n\nOn July 11, 1997, Doe, proceeding pr o se, filed suit\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 1983 and the Pennsylvania\nConfidentiality of HIV-Related Infor mation Act, 35 P.S.\nS 7601 et seq. in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint named as\ndefendants Joan Delie, Health Care Administrator at SCIP;\nDr. Paul Noel, Medical Director of SCIP; Diane Manson, a\nNurse/Grievance Officer; and Sophie Swika and Kim\nZimmerman, both nurses at SCIP. Doe claimed his\nconstitutional right to privacy was violated by the\"open-\ndoor\" examination room policy, by the disclosure of his\nmedical condition to corrections officer escorts, and by the\nloud announcement of the names of his medications. He\n\n                               3\n\falleged that these practices made him reluctant to discuss\nembarrassing symptoms with doctors, subjected him to\npsychological harassment and humiliation, and caused him\nto discontinue treatment. Doe requested declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, as well as nominal, compensatory, and\npunitive damages.\n\nOn August 5, 1997, Doe filed motions for a temporary\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction ordering\ndefendants to provide for nondisclosure of his medical\ninformation during sick call visits and medication\ndistribution. The Magistrate Judge recommended that both\nmotions be denied pending service of the complaint and\nmotions on defendants. This Report and Recommendation\nwas adopted by the District Court on September 16, 1997.\n\nAfter service of the complaint,1 defendants Delie, Manson,\nand Swika, and defendant Noel by separate motion, moved\nto dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Doe was granted leave to\nfile an amended complaint and did so on Mar ch 3, 1998.\nThe amended complaint added James Price, the\nsuperintendent of SCIP, as a defendant and otherwise\nreasserted Doe's privacy claims. Defendants r easserted\ntheir motions to dismiss based, inter alia, on the defense of\nqualified immunity, which shields public officials from\nactions for damages unless their conduct was unr easonable\nin light of clearly established law.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge issued a Report and\nRecommendation on September 21, 1998. The Magistrate\nfound that no clear federal constitutional right to\nnondisclosure of an inmate's medical condition exists and\nrecommended dismissal of defendants Delie, Manson,\nSwika, and Price on grounds of qualified immunity. The\nMagistrate found that the only involvement alleged as to\ndefendant Noel was his inadequate response to Doe's\ngrievances, which did not give rise to a S 1983 claim. In\naddition, the Magistrate Judge found, sua sponte , that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Nurse Zimmerman was never served with pr ocess in the district court.\nShe is not a Commonwealth employee, and was appar ently referred to\nSCIP through a private nursing facility. Ef forts to locate her at that\nagency were unsuccessful.\n\n                                4\n\fdefendant Zimmerman was entitled to qualified immunity\nfor her alleged misconduct and recommended dismissal of\nthe complaint against her pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Finally, the Magistrate Judge\nrecommended that the District Court decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Doe's state law claims.\n\nOver Doe's objections, the District Court adopted the\nMagistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and\ndismissed the case on December 17, 1998. On January 13,\n1999, Doe filed his notice of appeal of the District Court's\ndecision. We appointed counsel for Doe and have benefitted\nas a result from counsel's willingness to undertake this\nrepresentation.\n\nShortly before oral argument, counsel informed us that\nDoe was awaiting a re-trial on his conviction. Counsel has\nnow informed us that Doe was acquitted in his re-trial, and\ntherefore is no longer an inmate at SCIP .\n\nII.

As a result of his\nacquittal, Doe is no longer an inmate at SCIP . It is clear\nthat any declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the\nstaff at SCIP would have no impact on him, and therefore\nhis equitable claims are moot.\n\nDoe argues that his case falls into the \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review\" exception to the mootness\ndoctrine. The exception is limited to cases which have two\nelements: \"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too\nshort to be fully litigated to its cessation or expiration and\n(2) there is a reasonable likelihood that the same\ncomplaining party would be subjected to the same action\nagain.\" Abdul-Akbar v.

Given the length of\ntime it took Doe, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis,\nto reach this stage of the litigation, we will assume,\narguendo, that the first element is satisfied.\n\nHowever, as a result of his acquittal, we simply cannot\nconclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that he would\nbe subjected to the same conduct. See Weinstein, 423 U.S.\nat 149 (former inmate's challenge to par ole decisions\nmooted upon his release from supervision); see also Abdul-\nAkbar, 4 F.3d at 206 (cautioning against\"conjecture\" that\nprisoner could again be incarcerated at maximum security\nunit and holding prisoner's release from maximum security\nunit mooted challenge to law library in maximum security\nunit).2 Doe is no longer incar cerated at SCIP.

A PRISONER'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN MEDICAL\nRECORDS\n\nSection 1983 imposes civil liability upon any person who,\nacting under the color of state law, deprives another\nindividual of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by\nthe Constitution or laws of the United States. 42 U.S.C.\nS 1983. This section does not create any new substantive\nrights, but it provides a remedy for the violation of a federal\nconstitutional or statutory right conferred elsewhere. Baker\nv.

The Sixth Circuit r eached the merits to dismiss\nthe privacy claim of an HIV-positive prisoner , but, as discussed in\nfootnote six, infra, the substantive law of privacy in the Sixth Circuit\nconflicts with that of the Third Circuit.\n\n3. While the District Court did not consider the effect of S 803(d)(e) of\nthe\nPrison Litigation Reform Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(e), on Doe's\nclaims, we have since recognized that S 1997e(e) prohibits compensatory\ndamages for mental or emotional injury absent allegations of physical\ninjury. Allah v. Al-Hafeez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770376\"><a href=\"/opinion/770376/michael-malik-allah-minister-khalil-wali-muhammad-michael-malik-allah-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (3d Cir. 2000). However,\nS 1997e(e) does not bar claims seeking nominal damages to vindicate\nconstitutional rights, nor claims seeking punitive damages to deter or\npunish egregious violations of constitutional rights. Id. Therefore, while\nDoe's claims for compensatory damage are barr ed by S 1997e(e), his\nclaims for nominal damages survive. Moreover , to the extent that Doe's\npunitive damages claims stem solely from the violations of his right to\nmedical privacy, and not from any emotional or mental distress suffered,\nthose claims are not barred by S 1997e(e). See id. at 252.\n\n                               7\n\fWhen the defendant in a S 1983 action claims qualified\nimmunity, a court must first determine if the plaintiff 's\nallegations are sufficient to establish the violation of a\nfederal constitutional or statutory right.

Id. If the plaintiff 's allegations fail to satisfy\neither inquiry, then a defendant is entitled to qualified\nimmunity and dismissal of the case. Deciding \"this purely\nlegal question permits courts expeditiously to weed out\nsuits which fail the test without requiring a defendant who\nrightly claims qualified immunity to engage in expensive\nand time consuming preparation to defend the suit on its\nmerits.\" Siegert v.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Supr eme Court has twice stated in\nmandatory, unqualified language that \"[a] court evaluating a claim of\nqualified immunity must first deter mine whether the plaintiff has alleged\nthe deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all . . .\" Wilson,\n526\nU.S. at 609 quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. at 290 (internal\nquotations omitted) (emphasis added), Judge Garth's dissent would\nprefer that we skip the first prong of qualified immunity analysis. See\nDissent, infra at p. 40. This practice ignor es the Supreme Court's\nexpress language and creates an exception based on the procedural\nposture of the case. While there may be pragmatic considerations\nfavoring Judge Garth's qualification of the Supr eme Court's unqualified\nlanguage, the Court has not yet suggested any basis for departing from\nthe rule articulated in Wilson. Our thr eshold task here, in qualified\nimmunity analysis, is to determine whether Doe has alleged a violation\nof a constitutional right. We hold that he has, although the full extent\nof\nthat right in the prison setting has yet to be delineated. Whether and\nhow prison officials must accommodate, or may curtail and even\nextinguish that right, in light of the penological interests concerned, is\nnot before the Court today.\n\n                               8\n\f1.\n\nAn individual has a constitutional right to privacy which\nprotects \"the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of\npersonal matters.\" Whalen v.

First, there must be a valid, rational\n       connection between the prison regulation and the\n       legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify\n       it, and this connection must not be so remote as to\n       render the policy arbitrary or irrational. Second, a\n       court must consider whether inmates retain alternative\n       means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a\n       court must take into account the costs that\n       accommodating the right would impose on other\n       inmates, guards, and prison resour ces generally. And\n       fourth, a court must consider whether there ar e\n       alternatives to the regulation that fully accommodate\n       the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid\n       penological interests.\n\nDehart v.

The issue is whether, given\nthe established law and the information available to\nDefendants, reasonable prison officials in Defendants'\npositions could have believed that their conduct was lawful.\nSee Paff v.

First, Doe\nargues that a Pennsylvania statute both cr eates a right and\nserves to inform defendants of the existence of that right.\nSecond, Doe argues that, by 1995, a \"gr owing consensus\"\nof other courts had held that inmates possess a right to\nprivacy in their medical records. Finally, Doe argues that\nthe class action settlement in Austin v. Pennsylvania Dept.\nof Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1557019\"><a href=\"/opinion/1557019/austin-v-pennsylvania-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S 7603, became effective March 1,\n1991. Under the Act, any person who obtains confidential\nHIV-related information in the course of providing health or\nsocial services, or pursuant to consent, may not disclose\nthe information, except by consent, or to certain designated\npersons. 35 P.S. S 7607. The state right is enforceable in a\nprivate cause of action for damages. 35 P.S.S 7610. Doe\ncontends that he consented to the HIV test but did not\nconsent to the various disclosures made by defendants.\nWhile Doe concedes that the state statute cannot be the\nbasis for his federal action, he argues that prison officials\ncould not have been acting \"reasonably\" when they were in\ndirect violation of a clear state statute; they thus lost the\nprotections of qualified immunity.\n\nThis argument misinterprets the ef fect of a state law on\na federal constitutional claim. The Supreme Court has held\nthat officials do not forfeit qualified immunity from suit for\nviolation of a federal constitutional right because they failed\nto comply with a clear state statute.

For example, state law may bear upon a claim under the Due Process\nclause when the property interest pr otected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment is created by state law. See Boar d of Regents v.

But the state statute cannot\"clearly\nestablish\" the federal right for qualified immunity purposes.\n\nSecond, a review of decisions which had addr essed the\nissue by 1995 reveals that no court of appeals had held\nthat prisoners retained a constitutional right to the privacy\nof their medical information. In fact, only a handful of\ndistrict court opinions had done so.\n\nThe earliest circuit opinion addressing the issue analyzed\na prison policy of segregating HIV-positive inmates from the\ngeneral prison population. Harris v. Thigpen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566783\"><a href=\"/opinion/566783/carmen-jean-harris-and-leslie-john-pettway-james-hollifield-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1515-1521 (11th Cir. 1991). In Harris, the Eleventh\nCircuit stated that the \"precise natur e and scope of the\nprivacy right at issue in this case is rather ill-defined.\" Id.\nat 1513. Nevertheless, the court assumed, ar guendo, that\nHIV-positive inmates had a \"constitutionally-protected\nprivacy interest\" in nondisclosure of their medical\ninformation. The court acknowledged that \"the scope of\nsuch a right, however, is far from settled, and we need not\ndivine its precise parameters here,\" Id. at 1513 n. 26,\nbecause it found that the Department of Corr ections'\ndecision to segregate such inmates from the general prison\npopulation served a legitimate penological inter est in\nreducing the transmission of HIV and reducing the threat\nof violence. Id. at 1521.\n\nPrior to 1995, other courts of appeals likewise upheld the\nsegregation of HIV-positive inmates fr om the general\npopulation. See, e.g. Camarillo v. McCarthy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611008\"><a href=\"/opinion/611008/james-haynes-camarillo-v-daniel-j-mccarthy-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n640 n.2 (9th Cir. 1993) (reserving question of whether HIV\nsegregation policy is constitutional but holding officers\nentitled to qualified immunity); Moore v.

The appellate cases illustrate the problem identified by the Supreme\nCourt in qualified immunity cases: \"[T]he generally sound rule of\navoiding determination of constitutional issues does not readily fit the\nsituation presented here [because] when liability is claimed on the basis\nof a constitutional violation, even a finding of qualified immunity\nrequires some determination about the state of constitutional law at the\ntime the officer acted. What is more significant is that if the policy of\navoidance [of constitutional issues] wer e always followed in favor of\nruling on qualified immunity whenever ther e was no clearly settled\nconstitutional rule of primary conduct, standar ds of official conduct\nwould tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment both of officials and\nindividuals.

Where, as in\nAustin, the factual and legal issues wer e numerous, broad\nand complex, the decision to settle a case cannot be\nelevated to the recognition of a constitutional right.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the\ncited authorities, individually or in combination, clearly\nestablished an inmate's constitutional right to privacy in\nhis medical information. Government officials must stay\nabreast of constitutional developments, but they are not\n\"expected to predict the future course of constitutional\nlaw.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. at 617. We conclude that\nthe contours of defendants' legal obligations under the\nConstitution were not sufficiently clear in 1995 that a\nreasonable prison official would understand that the non-\nconsensual disclosure of a prisoner's HIV status violates\nthe Constitution. Accordingly, we will affir m the District\nCourt order granting Defendants qualified immunity from\nPlaintiff 's claims.13\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthe anonymity of HIV-infected inmates ar e too stringent. These inmates\nwant the DOC to test all inmates and notify the general population of\nthose inmates who are HIV-positive. Such a notification procedure is\nunrelated to any penological interest and would most likely violate state\nlaw . . . and the Constitution of the United States.\" Austin, 876 F. Supp.\nat 1466. With respect to the Turner factors, however, the Austin court\nstated that \"there was no assurance that this Court would order an\nelimination of the notification provision. Although individuals have an\ninterest in preventing disclosure of their HIV status which is protected\nby state law and the Constitution, inmates' rights must necessarily yield\nto a certain extent to legitimate penological inter ests.\" Id. at 1467.\n\n13. We will likewise affirm the District Court's order dismissing Nurse\nZimmerman pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

The exact parameters\nof a prisoner's right to privacy in that infor mation will have\nto be determined in a later case on a mor e complete record,\nwhere the Turner factors can be fully considered in the\ncontext of the penological interests concer ned. Moreover,\nbecause we are granting qualified immunity to the\ndefendants, we also do not go on to the issue of the\nstandard that is utilized to determine whether a prisoner's\nright to privacy in his medical information has been\nviolated. That determination too will have to wait for\nanother day.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe hold that the Fourteenth Amendment pr otects an\ninmate's right to medical privacy, subject to legitimate\npenological interests. However, because this right was not\nclearly established at the time of defendants' conduct, we\nwill affirm the District Court's dismissal of Doe's complaint\non the basis of qualified immunity.\n\n                               21\n\fNYGAARD, concurring and dissenting:\n\nI agree with Judge Roth's conclusion that prisoners have\na right to privacy in their medical information, and that\nthis right may be compromised only if it conflicts with a\nlegitimate penological objective that satisfies the criteria\noutlined in Turner v.

I would conclude, however, that Doe's right to\nprivacy in medical matters was clearly established at the\ntime of the alleged violations such that Appellees, as\nreasonable employees of the Pennsylvania Department of\nCorrections, should have known that the right existed and\ntherefore cannot be dismissed from defending these\nallegations on the basis of qualified immunity. Hence, I\ndissent from the conclusions contained in Section III, B. 2\nof Judge Roth's opinion.\n\nIt is now axiomatic that the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity bars government officials fr om liability for\ndamages unless they disobeyed \"clearly establish[ed]\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a r easonable\nperson would have known.\" Harlow v.

Nonetheless, at the same\ntime, a court need not have ruled on a case bearing a\n\"precise factual correspondence\" with the one under\nconsideration. Assaf v.

Thus, gover nment\nofficials are not barred from the protection of qualified\nimmunity if they fail to predict fluctuations in legal debates.\nThey will not, however, be granted immunity if they fail to\nmake obvious inferences from a generally established right,\nto its application in particular situations.\n\nThe question is whether these members of the\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections should have\nknown from 1995 through 1997 that prisoners possessed a\n\n                               22\n\fright to the privacy of their medical recor ds. I proceed to\nmy conclusion as follows:\n\nFirst, we have recognized the right to confidentiality in\nmedical records since 1980. United States v. Westinghouse\nElec. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386024\"><a href=\"/opinion/386024/8-osh-casbna-2131-1980-oshd-cch-p-24879-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (3d Cir . 1980). We stated in\nWestinghouse that medical recor ds, which \"may contain\nintimate facts of a personal nature, ar e well within the\nambit of materials entitled to privacy protection.\nInformation about one's body and state of health is a\nmatter which the individual is ordinarily entitled to retain\nwithin the private enclave where he may lead a private life.\"\nId. at 577 (citations omitted).

In Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct.\nat 2257, the Supreme Court determined that any alleged\nviolation of a prisoner's right will be unwarranted unless it\nis determined to be \"reasonably r elated to legitimate\npenological interests.\" See also W ashington v.

Second, is there an alter native means for the\n\n                               23\n\fprisoner to exercise the right? Third, will accommodating\nthe right cause an unreasonable burden on the staff, other\ninmates, or prison resources? Fourth, is there another\nobvious means to accomplish the prison's objective? The\nCourt's intention in fashioning this test was \"to formulate\na standard of review for prisoners' constitutional claims\nthat is responsive both to the policy of judicial restraint\nregarding prisoner complaints and [to] the need to protect\nconstitutional rights.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. at\n2257 (citations omitted).\n\nAlthough we have given \"[p]rison officials . . . broad\ndiscretion in fashioning appropriate r esponses to legitimate\npenological objectives consistent with the constitutional\nrights of inmates,\" Monmouth County, 834 F.2d at 343,\nTurner demands that the responses at issue reasonably\nserve a valid penological interest. The courts must not,\ntherefore, allow our analysis to be obscur ed by bald\nassertions from prison officials who claim that the policy in\nquestion serves a legitimate end.

Wilson, 526 U.S. at 616. Thus although a lone\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Judge Roth states that the Seventh Circuit \"rejected\" Woodsin\nAnderson v. Romero, 72, F.3d 518 (7th Cir. 1995). This is not entirely\naccurate. The court in Anderson merely declined to reach the question.\n\n                               26\n\fDistrict Court opinion may not secure a right, when that\nopinion is combined with opinions from the Supr eme Court,\nCourts of Appeals, and a variety of District Courts, then I\nwould conclude that the right was established to an extent\nsufficient to notify the officials.\n\nTwo other factors render the officials' failure to recognize\nDoe's right to privacy in his medical recor ds still more\nunreasonable. First, The Pennsylvania Confidentiality of\nHIV-Related Information Act, 35 P .S. S 7603, which became\neffective on March 1, 1991, provides a statutory right to\nnondisclosure. Section 7607 states:\n\n       (a) Limitations on disclosure.--No person or employee,\n       or agent of such person, who obtains confidential HIV-\n       related information in the course of pr oviding any\n       health or social service or pursuant to a release of\n       confidential HIV-related information under subsection\n       (c) may disclose or be compelled to disclose the\n       information.\n\nThe statute makes no exception for inmates, as it states\nthat HIV-related information can be disclosed to\n\n       [e]mployees of county mental health/mental\n       retardation agencies, county childr en and youth\n       agencies, county juvenile probation departments,\n       county or State facilities for delinquent youth, and\n       contracted residential providers of the above-named\n       entities receiving or contemplating residential\n       placement of the subject, who:\n\n        (i) generally are authorized to receive medical\n       information; and\n\n        (ii) are responsible for ensuring that the subject\n       receives appropriate health care; and\n\n        (iii) have a need to know the HIV-r elated information\n       in order to ensure such care is pr ovided.\n\nId. Because no exception is made for adult prisoners, and\nall other exceptions are clearly stated, the Department of\nCorrections should have known by March 1991 that\nprisoners possess a right to the privacy of their HIV-related\ninformation. Considering the specificity of the statute, and\n\n                               27\n\fits precise applicability to the facts of this case, the right\nunder review was clearly established in 1991.\n\nAppellees, and Judge Roth, claim that a state statute is\nirrelevant to the issue of qualified immunity on a federal\nclaim. See Davis v. Scherer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111241\"><a href=\"/opinion/111241/davis-v-scherer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194-97, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111241\"><a href=\"/opinion/111241/davis-v-scherer/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

Halloway, Davis held that\n\n       an official's clear violation of a state administrative\n       regulation does not allow a S 1983 plaintiff to overcome\n       the official's qualified immunity. Only in this context is\n       the Court's statement comprehensible: `A plaintiff who\n       seeks damages for violation of constitutional or\n       statutory rights may overcome the appellee official's\n       qualified immunity only by showing that those rights\n       were clearly established . . .' Davis, in short, concerned\n       not the authorities a court may consider in\n       determining qualified immunity, but this entirely\n       discrete question: Is qualified immunity defeated where\n       an appellee violates any clearly established duty,\n       including one under state law, or must the clearly\n       established right be the federal right on which the\n       claim for relief is based? The Court held the latter.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112933\"><a href=\"/opinion/112933/elder-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112933\"><a href=\"/opinion/112933/elder-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023 (1994) (citations\nomitted).\n\nThe reason why I disagree with Judge Roth is that\nalthough a state statute will not, by itself, place an official\non notice of a federal right, to me such a statutory right\nshould raise the official's awareness that a parallel federal\nright may exist. Such a warning should facilitate a\nreasonable official's ability to make the inference discussed\nabove. This position is congruent with the objectives of the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity. If a state statute clearly\narticulates a right, and places those within its jurisdiction\non notice of that right, and if that right per fectly coincides\nwith a federally protected right, then why would we not\nconsider the statute's existence when determining whether\nthe offender should have known of the federal right? I think\nwe should. Indeed it seems to me that a state statute,\nlocally promulgated, and free from many of the\nuncertainties of case law, most effectively notifies the\ncommunity of a protected right, and reinforces federal law.\n\n                                28\n\fRegardless of how a person learned of the right, and\nregardless of whether she thought she was violating state\nor federal law, she knew that a right existed and that she\nwas violating it. The purpose of qualified immunity is to\nprotect government officials fr om having to defend\nthemselves in litigation over rights and duties that they did\nnot know they were violating. Here, the Appellees were\nclearly notified by the 1991 statute that Doe was entitled to\nthe privacy of his medical records under state law. The\ninference that prisoners were entitled to the same right\nunder federal law was implicit by 1995. If we allow the state\nstatute to play no role in assessing whether or not the\nofficials should have known of the federal right, then we\nallow officials to turn a blind eye to the general state of the\nlaw and discourage them from making a good faith effort to\nrecognize such implicit principles. I consider this good faith\neffort to be within the responsibilities of a \"reasonable\nofficial.\"\n\nIn addition, as powerful evidence that these officials\nknew they were violating Doe's right to privacy, in an\nopinion establishing a right to privacy for inmates' HIV-\nrelated medical records, Austin v. Pennsylvanian Dep't of\nCorr., the very agency and officials before us now were also\nappellees in that case. In that opinion in January 1995, the\nCourt stated that the \"DOC has agreed to keep inmates'\nmedical information regarding HIV status confidential and\nto advocate a universal precautions policy in place of the\ncurrent Contagious Disease Notification Policy in its\nforthcoming negotiations with the union repr esentative of\nits custody staff.\" Austin, 876 F . Supp. at 1453. This\ndecision alone directly notified Appellees of their obligation\nto protect Doe's privacy right. As Judge Roth correctly\nstates, court approval of a settlement does not provide a\nlegal decision regarding the constitutionality of the\nelements of the settlement. But that is not the test. The\ncourt clearly warned the very institution before us in this\nmatter that it risked constitutional violations by disclosure.\nIndeed the language the Court used was that disclosure of\na prisoner's HIV-related medical infor mation, if \"unrelated\nto any penological interest . . . would most likely violate\nstate law, and the Constitution of the United States.\" Id. at\n1437. Austin explained that \"[a]lthough individuals have an\n\n                               29\n\finterest in preventing disclosure of their HIV status which\nis protected by state law and the Constitution, inmates'\nrights must necessarily yield to a certain extent to\nlegitimate penological interests,\" and then clearly stated the\ncriterion of the Turner test. Id. In light of this notification,\nit seems disingenuous to claim that the officials here\ndeserve protection from Doe's claims because they did not\nknow that they could not arbitrarily disclose a prisoner's\nmedical information.2\n\n       In summary, the combination of the preponderance of\ncase law, the state statute, and the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections' previous agr eement to respect\nprivacy in prisoners' HIV-related materials, clearly\nestablished the right in question. I would find that, taken\ntogether, these factors defeat Appellees' claim to qualified\nimmunity. I therefore respectfully dissent from this aspect\nof the Majority's decision.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Finally, I note that the manner in which this delicate information was\ndisseminated indicates to me that the officials knew they were\nmisbehaving, but persisted in doing so regar dless of the fact that they\nwere mistreating Doe.\n\n                               30\n\fGARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting and concurring.\n\nI agree with Judge Roth that the District Court's decision\ndismissing Doe's complaint should be affir med because the\ndefendants have qualified immunity from Doe's claims.\nHowever, I cannot agree that, on this r ecord brought before\nus on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,1 we can or should declare\nthat \"a constitutional right to privacy in one's medical\ninformation exists in prison.\" (Roth Op. at 11.) This case is\none of first impression, and Judge Roth's holding, with\nwhich Judge Nygaard concurs as to the constitutional right,2\nmay have a multitude of ramifications in this Cir cuit where\nmajor prisons abound. It is for that reason that I write\nseparately contesting the creation of a constitutional right\nof privacy and confidentiality for prisoners. 3\n\nIt is true that, in so holding, Judge Roth qualifies this\nstatement, observing that \"Doe's constitutional right is\nsubject to substantial restrictions and limitations in order\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A motion brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\nis granted only if: \"taking the allegations of the complaint as true, . .\n.\nand viewing them liberally giving plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences\nwhich fairly may be drawn therefrom, . . .`it appears beyond doubt that\nthe plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim\nwhich\nwould entitle [them] to relief.' \"Bogosian v.

For ease of reference, I will r efer to Judge Roth's holding throughout\nthis dissent and concurrence, although Judge Nygaard constitutes her\nmajority with respect to the establishment of a constitutional right to\nprivacy in prison.\n\n3. In her footnote 3, relevant to her discussion of mootness, (see Roth\nOp., Part III.A), Judge Roth asserts that S 1997e(e) of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") does not bar claims for punitive damages,\nrelying on Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F .3d 247, 251 (3d Cir. 2000). I\ndisagree with her analysis, because I believe that this case is far more\nsimilar to Davis v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184664\"><a href=\"/opinion/184664/davis-michael-lee-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.Cir. 1998),\nwhere the D.C. Circuit held that an inmate's punitive damages claims\nwere barred by the PLRA. We distinguished Davis in Allah \"because\nthose claims [in Davis] stemmed fr om the allegations of emotional and\nmental injury [suffered as a r esult of the violation of Davis'\nconstitutional\nright to privacy].\" 226 F.3d at 252. As a consequence, contrary to Judge\nRoth, I would hold that Doe's punitive damages claim is barred by the\nPLRA, although I agree that the claim for nominal damages prevents our\ndismissing Doe's action as moot.\n\f31\n\ffor correctional officers to achieve legitimate correctional\ngoals and maintain institutional security.\" (Roth Op. at 11.)\nNevertheless, because she and I agree that such a\nconstitutional right of privacy in prison has not been and is\nnot clearly established, the prudential and wiser course of\naction in this case is to decline to determine that such a\nconstitutional right has been established at all .\n\nI.\n\nThe record before us in this case is naked of anything\nother than Doe's allegations in his complaint--allegations\nwhich complain of a lack of privacy and confidentiality as\nwell as a violation of his grievance/appeal rights. 4 However,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. That statement of Doe's claim alleges:\n\n       - Doe is a death row prisoner;\n\n       - After submitting to a blood test, Doe was informed by the prison\n       medical staff that he was HIV-positive and that this medical\n       condition would be kept confidential;\n\n       - He has undergone medical examinations and tests in the open\n       presence of correctional officers and other inmates;\n\n       - The clinic door is kept open when Doe is seen by doctors and\n       specialists from the Centers for Disease Contr ol (CDC), so that\n       correctional officers can see Doe;\n\n       - When Doe has an appointment with a CDC specialist, the\n       correctional officers who escort him to the appointment are\n       informed of the nature of the appointment;\n\n       - On one occasion, a nurse announced aloud the names of the\n       medications being delivered to Doe in the pr esence of other\n       inmates and that nurse told a corrections officer about Doe's\n       condition;\n\n       - In connection with Doe's internal grievance about the sick call\n       procedure, he was interviewed by a medical grievance officer\n       whom Doe told that another inmate twice over heard a nurse\n       stating the name of Doe's medication when delivering it to him;\n\n       - Doe's internal grievance, which contained information about his\n       HIV-positive status, was forwarded to the superintendent of the\n       prison;\n\n                               32\n\fwe have not been informed and do not know whether Doe,\nwho was a death penalty prisoner, was r equired to be\nclosely guarded at all times by prison guar ds, thereby\nvirtually ensuring that the guards would be privy even to\nprivate conversations. We do not know the construction and\ndimensions of the medical area or medication dispensary at\nSCI-Pittsburgh--whether there ar e communal examination\nrooms or private examination cubicles. W e do not know the\nlocation of Doe's death penalty cell in the Restricted\nHousing Unit (\"RHU\"), or the route, access, and distance\nfrom his cell to the medical area. W e do not know the\ncircumstances under which medication is dispensed at sick\ncall--the structure and configuration of the dispensary, the\nlocation in the dispensary of physicians, nurses, guards,\nand other prisoners, or the manner in which prisoners\nreceive medication (are they separately scheduled or are\nthey scheduled in a group or in an open line?). Nor do we\nknow the administrative complexities encounter ed by\nprison authorities in ensuring the manner in which each\nprisoner receives the correct medication. We do not know\nthe state of the security precautions in the dispensary area\nas compared to the security in the RHU, nor do we know\nthe required provisions for security in the passageways\nbetween the two areas.\n\nAll that we do know from Doe's complaint is 1) that the\nclinic door is kept open when Doe is seen by doctors and\nCDC specialists so that Doe may be viewed by corr ections\nofficers,5 and 2) that, when Doe receives his medication, the\nmedication is sometimes referred to by name. Moreover,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       - Prison officials responded to Doe's internal grievance by\n       informing him that the nurses denied his allegations and that the\n       door had to be left open when Doe was being examined by\n       specialists and doctors due to a \"security issue\"; and\n\n       - His appeal rights had been affected by being obliged to go\n       through the superintendent prior to appeal tofinal review.\n\n(App. 15a-19a.)\n\n5. Judge Roth acknowledges that Doe has conceded that this practice\nmay be justified by the prison's legitimate security concerns. (Roth Op.\nat 12.)\n\n                               33\n\fbecause, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, no response or\ninformation is available from, in this case, the prison\nauthorities, we have no knowledge of the physical,\nstructural, or security conditions in prison that contribute\nto and may generate a diminished expectation of privacy or\nconfidentiality.6\n\nPrisons are communal environments in which a large\nnumber of inmates and prison employees coexist in a\nconfined living space. For this reason, inmates have little\nphysical privacy, and the circumstances of medical\ntreatment may not conform to private, non-prison norms.\nPrisoners must do everything in close proximity to other\ninmates and prison personnel, including sleeping, eating,\ndressing, bathing, and, to a certain extent, r eceiving\nmedical attention.\n\nII.\n\nAnother reality of prison life is the fact that prison\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Because, as noted, this is an appeal fr om a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,\nthe defendants have not been able to inform us of their actions,\nprocedures, regulations, explanations, or justifications in response to\nDoe's complaint. (See text infra, discussing the inadvisability of\ncreating\nconstitutional rights based on a naked recor d consisting only of the\nprisoner-plaintiff 's allegations.) It is not only impossible to analyze\nthe\nfactors identified in Turner (connection between regulation and\njustification; alternative means of exer cising right; costs of\naccommodating right; and alternatives to the r egulation), as even Judge\nRoth acknowledges (see Roth Op. at 12 (\"defendants did not have the\nopportunity to [produce] any evidence of legitimate penological interests,\ncosts. . . , or availability of alternatives. . .\")), but it is similarly\nhopeless\nto draw upon instruction from the \"privacy?\" cases cited by both Judge\nRoth and Judge Nygaard. This is so because, her e, there are no factual\ncircumstances that can be likened or compar ed to the circumstances\ndescribed in the cases my colleagues have cited, almost all of which are\nnon-prison cases or are inapposite for some other reason and, therefore,\nare not relevant in any event.

Prison systems are generally in this\nday and age overcrowded and understaf fed. Therefore,\naccommodation of prisoners' privacy and confidentiality\ndemands, their needs, and even their rights cannot be\nassumed or declared in a vacuum. Considering the\ncommunal nature of prison existence, similar in many\nprivacy (or lack of privacy) aspects to life in the military,\ntogether with the limited and often insufficientfinancial\nresources of prisons, I believe it to be rash and imprudent\nto hold at this time, without much more infor mation about\nprison security concerns, that Doe has a constitutional\nright to privacy in his HIV-positive status, any more than\nhe has a constitutional right of privacy in his cell. See\nHudson v.

See Griswold v.

However, certainly Doe's expectation of\nprivacy and confidentiality of medical infor mation in a\ncommunal dispensary setting cannot be deemed to be\ngreater than his expectation of privacy in his cell,\ndepending, of course, on all of the circumstances which I\nhave noted above and as to which we have no infor mation.\n\nIndeed, I take issue with Judge Roth's assertion that\n\"Doe's asserted right to privacy in his medical information\nis completely different than the right extinguished in\nHudson.\" (Roth Op. at 10.) After all, in Hudson, the\nSupreme Court declined to declare a constitutional right\nbecause \"[t]he recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in\ntheir individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the\nconcept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of\npenal institutions,\" 468 U.S. at 526, wher eas, here, Judge\nRoth has declared a constitutional right, but has held that\n\"Doe's constitutional right is subject to substantial\nrestrictions and limitations in order for correctional officials\nto achieve legitimate correctional goals and maintain\n\n                                35\n\finstitutional security.\" (Roth Op. at 11.) If there are\nconcerns, as evidently Judge Roth has her e, that\n\"legitimate correctional goals\" and \"institutional security\"\nmay be jeopardized by the exercise of Doe's purported\nconstitutional right, it would seem to me only prudent that\nwe should withhold declaring a constitutional right of\nprivacy until we have obtained the information we lack.\n\nThat is the course of action that the Supreme Court took\nin Hudson, where the Court decided the very limited\nquestion of a prisoner's Fourth Amendment privacy right in\nhis cell on an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,\nnot a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion, and\neven Powell v. Schriver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763559\"><a href=\"/opinion/763559/wayne-powell-as-of-the-estate-of-dana-kimberly-devilla-v-sunny-schriver/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999), which\nJudge Roth cites in support of her declared constitutional\nright, went to full trial before the Second Cir cuit announced\nthat a constitutional right had been established.\n\nI believe that we can analogize Doe's situation to the\nSupreme Court's rationale in Hudson, where the Court, as\nnoted, held that prisoners do not have a Fourth\nAmendment right to privacy in their cells. Doe's complaint\nincludes claims of violation of his privacy, violation of\nconfidentiality, and violation of his rights under the\ngrievances and appeal procedures. My r eading of Doe's\ncomplaint reveals that it is the privacy aspect on which Doe\nhas focused and which has caused his distress. But, the\nquestion that then arises is whether Doe had a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy concerning his HIV -positive status.\nIn this respect, I believe we can look to Hudson, where the\nCourt stated:\n\n       Determining whether an expectation of privacy is\n       \"legitimate\" or \"reasonable\" necessarily entails a\n       balancing of interests. The two inter ests here are the\n       interest of society in the security of its penal\n       institutions and the interest of the prisoner in privacy\n       within his cell. The latter interest, of course, is already\n       limited by the exigencies of the circumstances: A prison\n       \"shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home, an\n       automobile, an office, or a hotel room.\" We strike the\n       balance in favor of institutional security, which we\n       have noted is \"central to all other corrections goals.\" A\n       right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms\n\n                               36\n\f       is fundamentally incompatible with the close and\n       continual surveillance of inmates and their cells r equired\n       to ensure institutional security and inter nal order. We\n       are satisfied that society would insist that the\n       prisoner's expectation of privacy always yield to what\n       must be considered the paramount interest in\n       institutional security. We believe that it is accepted by\n       our society that \"[l]oss of freedom of choice and privacy\n       are inherent incidents of confinement.\"\n\nHudson, 468 U.S. at 527-28 (internal citations omitted)\n(emphasis added). So too is the privacy inter est implicated\nin this case \"limited by the exigencies of the\ncircumstances,\" namely the communal natur e of prison life,\nthe logistical problems with prisoner confidentiality in\nprison medical facilities, and the need for prisoners,\nespecially death row prisoners such as Doe, to be watched\nclosely by prison guards. Therefor e, I believe that,\ndepending upon the prison information as to which we are\nstill ignorant, Doe's right to privacy in the communication\nof his medical information may be \"fundamentally\nincompatible with the close and continual surveillance of\ninmates\" as was the Fourth Amendment right in Hudson.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. I should note that the connection between the prison's security\ninterest and the deprivation of Doe's right to privacy is less direct here\nthan in the Fourth Amendment context. In Hudson , the Supreme Court\nobserved that prison officials must be able to maintain prison safety by\nentering inmate's cells to search for weapons and contraband. Here,\nDoe's right to privacy is overshadowed and diminished by the general\nneed to monitor and guard prisoners and by the very nature of a forced\ncommunal living environment, both of which make it difficult to preserve\na prisoner's privacy.\n\nMoreover, I believe that the balancing of interests prescribed by the\nSupreme Court in Hudson whereby expectations of privacy must be\nbalanced against legitimate penological and security interests cannot be\nundertaken unless and until those interests ar e known and spread upon\nthe record. Until that time, I cannot subscribe to or hold that prisoners\nhave the same privacy interests as the general non-prison population\nenjoys. I also believe that, when the balancing equation is completed, it\nwill weigh in favor of institutional security and against prisoners'\nunrealistic expectations of privacy as it does in the Fourth Amendment\ncontext.\n\n                               37\n\fSee Pell v.

Powell v. Schriver, see note 5, supra, in which the Second Circuit held\nthat a transsexual prisoner had a constitutional right to privacy in that\nmedical information but that the constitutional right to privacy in prison\nwas not clearly established, arose in the context of a district court's\ngrant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the defendant. In that\ncase, unlike this one, the Second Circuit had the benefit of a full\nfactual\nrecord after a full jury trial.\n\n                               39\n\fjudgment motion, which occurs at the close of discovery\nwhen a court may make a decision on the existence of a\nconstitutional right with the benefit of the r elevant facts.\n\nHence, it seems to me that the Wilson rule is not\nappropriately extended to rulings on Rule 12(b)(6) motions\nto dismiss, where the factual recor d is as scant as it is\nhere. In my opinion, to construct a constitutional right out\nof the whole cloth without analysis and without any\nknowledge of the institutional factors or security concerns\nattendant to a prison population or to a penal envir onment\nappears to me to be not only improvident but, as I have\nstated, rash. Indeed, I find it highly unusual that a court\nshould decide the existence of a constitutional right when\nit has essentially no record befor e it and no basis on which\nit may balance the claims made by the prisoner of privacy\nexpectations against legitimate security inter ests of the\nprison. Such a decision does not \"promote[ ] clarity in the\nlegal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both\nthe officers and the general public,\" W ilson, 526 U.S. at\n609, but instead causes uncertainty and confusion by\nestablishing an hitherto undeclared constitutional right\nwith no discernable standards.\n\nJudge Roth in her majority opinion has responded to this\ncritique and my thesis by citing two Supreme Court cases\nand declaring that the Supreme Court unequivocally\ndemands that, in qualified immunity cases, the\nconstitutional right first be declared befor e we address\nwhether that right has been clearly established. (Roth Op.\nat 8 n.4.) I quite agree with her that the doctrine she\ninvokes requires the declaration of a constitutional right as\nthe first order of business. However, and this is a major\n\"however,\" those cases to which she r efers were not cases\ndecided by a district court on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See\nWilson v. Layne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (1999) (\"The District\nCourt denied respondents' motion for summary judgment\non the basis of qualified immunity.\"); Conn v.

Similarly, I suggest that\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) standard cannot be applied by district\ncourts in first determining the existence of a constitutional\nright, because the facts and circumstances of the case, as\nthey bear upon penological interests and concer ns, must be\nexplored before a court can unequivocally announce a\nconstitutional right.\n\nMoreover, I have great difficulty, as I envisage the bench\nand bar will also have, in identifying the contours and\nparameters of an asserted constitutional right of prison\nprivacy that is still subject to the restrictions and\nlimitations of penal security interests. Even Judge Roth\nadmits that these restrictions, limitations, and\naccommodations have yet to be delineated. In particular,\nsince the relevant penological interests are presently not\nknown and may, by their very nature, cause the\nconstitutional right at issue here to disappear into thin air\nor be diminished to a point of nothingness, it seems to me\nfar better that we know precisely the right with which we\nare dealing before creating such a right liable to be\ndismissed on its first documented challenge.\n\nCertainly the Supreme Court could never have intended\nthat a fundamental constitutional right be cr eated with no\nregard for the framework or circumstances relevant to its\napplication. It is for that reason, I suggest and strongly\nurge, that it is far more prudent and r esponsible to await\nthe development of an appropriate recor d before plunging\nahead to create a fundamental right which may not ever be\nsustainable in a communal prison context.\n\n                               41\n\fJudge Roth acknowledges that the record in this case is\nundeveloped just as Doe himself \"concedes that the `open\ndoor' examination room policy [see note 3, supra] could\nconceivably be justified by a legitimate security interest but\ncontends that no such interest has been advanced here.\"\n(Roth Op. at 12.) Judge Roth, recognizing that we would\nordinarily remand for consideration by the trial court of\nissues concerning legitimate penological inter ests, security\nconcerns, costs of accommodating Doe's privacy interest,\navailability of alternatives, etc., did not take that course\nbecause the right which she has declared was not clearly\nestablished.\n\nI would hold that, if a record is undeveloped, as this one\nis, it cannot suffice to form the basis for the declaration of\na constitutional right. The announcement of a\nconstitutional right--an announcement which is never\nlightly reached and which inevitably has far -reaching and\nunpredictable consequences--should be gr ounded on\nunassailable legal principles and formulated based on a full\nfactual record. Had Judge Roth just assumed arguendo\nthat a constitutional right existed in prison, as the Eleventh\nCircuit did in Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F .2d 1495, 1513 (11th\nCir. 1991), (which was admittedly decided before the\nSupreme Court's holding in Wilson v. Layne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1999)), while I would have been uncomfortable, I would not\nhave resisted her announcement as I have. But, to\nannounce without reservation a full-fledged constitutional\nright of privacy in prison, as a matter of first impression,\nwithout a factual record, and without any substantial or\npersuasive case support, I believe transcends our r ole as\nreviewing judges. I think the declaration made in this case\nis wrong and is a grave mistake to publish as this Circuit's\nprecedent. I think that we will ultimatelyfind it necessary\nto retreat from the constitutional position this panel has\ntaken.\n\nIV.\n\nAccordingly, in my opinion, we are corr ect in disposing of\nthis case on qualified immunity grounds, not only because\nthe constitutional right was not clearly established but\nbecause, at this time and in the posture of the present\n\n                               42\n\fcase, we should not announce a constitutional right which\ncannot be defined at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nI therefore respectfully dissent fr om Judge Roth's\nconstitutional holding but concur in the final judgment,\nbecause I agree with Judge Roth that such a right has not\nbeen, and is not, clearly established and that, ther efore, the\nDistrict Court's dismissal of Doe's action should be\naffirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               43\n\f</pre>",
