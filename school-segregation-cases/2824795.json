The district court found\nthat the individual defendants enjoyed qualified immunity as individ-\nuals and granted summary judgment in their favor on that account. It\nalso granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the mer-\nits and in their official capacities. Kitchen appeals. We affirm, finding\nthat Kitchen enjoyed no constitutionally protected liberty interest in\nhis work-release determination under Virginia law.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   We review de novo a district court’s order granting summary judg-\nment and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).\nSummary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material\nfact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Once the moving party discharges\nits burden by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support\nthe nonmoving party’s case, the nonmoving party must come forward\nwith specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\nF.R.C.P. 56(c); see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986). Summary judgment will be granted\nunless a jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the\nevidence presented. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at\n249.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   The undisputed facts of this case follow. On July 15, 1997, in the\ncircuit court of Colonial Heights, Virginia, Ronnell Kitchen (Kitchen)\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                           3\npleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges of driving under the influ-\nence of intoxicants and driving on a suspended license. Kitchen was\nfined and sentenced to a jail term. The sentencing judge’s order also\ncontained the following:\n\n      The Court authorizes that the defendant may participate in\n      a work release program if he is eligible. The defendant must\n      further pay court costs on this charge of $128.00.\n\nKitchen’s brother-in-law, David Resnick, paid in full Kitchen’s fines\nand court costs that same day. Also that same day, Kitchen was com-\nmitted to the Riverside Regional Jail (Jail).\n\n   Sergeant Douglas Upshaw (Upshaw), a defendant in this action,\nwas the work-release coordinator for the Jail. On July 16, Upshaw\ninterviewed Kitchen, and Kitchen signed a \"Work and Education\nRelease Program Rules\" form. Kitchen also submitted a handwritten\nstatement, explaining that he had a strong desire to participate in the\nwork-release program because he had worked for Allied Signal for\ntwenty-four years, because he had four more years to go until retire-\nment, and because he would be fired if he missed five days of work.\nOn the same day as the interview, Upshaw sent by facsimile to Allied\nSignal a copy of the \"Employer’s Community Work Agreement,\" a\nform requiring the employer’s signature and imposing certain condi-\ntions on employers participating in work release.1 The fax to Allied\nSignal was marked \"Urgent\" and \"Reply ASAP.\"\n\n   Allied Signal did not respond to Upshaw’s fax. On July 17th,\nUpshaw then telephoned Allied Signal to discuss the company’s will-\ningness to participate in the program. Officials at Allied Signal, how-\never, expressed reservations about participating in Kitchen’s work\nrelease. Allied Signal did not want, for example, law enforcement\nofficials to come onto the work site to monitor Kitchen. Upshaw\nresponded that he would not need to speak with Kitchen at the work\nsite but would only need to see him there, perhaps through a window.\n  1\n    Allied Signal, for example, would have been required immediately to\ninform the Work Release Coordinator of any changes in Kitchen’s job\nstatus, to submit in advance his weekly work schedule, and to verify the\nnumber of hours he actually worked.\n\f4                        KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\nAllied officials told Upshaw that they wanted more time to consider\nthe matter and that they would contact him on July 18th with their\ndecision.\n\n   Not having heard back from Allied Signal, Upshaw again tele-\nphoned the company on Monday, July 21. That call apparently went\nunreturned. Instead, on July 23, Upshaw received a letter from an\nofficial at Allied Signal who said that company policy was not to par-\nticipate in work-release programs. The letter went on to say that\nKitchen was welcome to return to work under the previous conditions\nof his employment—if he could do so by July 24—but that, in effect,\nthe company would not cooperate with the Jail in supervising\nKitchen.\n\n   On July 23, pursuant to the Jail’s Standard Operating Procedures,\nknown as SOPs, Upshaw sent a letter to the sentencing judge explain-\ning Allied Signal’s refusal to participate and reporting that Kitchen\nwas therefore denied work-release privileges. In the letter, Upshaw\nalso asked the sentencing judge whether Kitchen should be granted\nwork release despite Allied Signal’s refusal to participate and also\napparently enclosed a copy of Allied Signal’s letter of July 23. There\nis no evidence in the record that the judge ever responded to\nUpshaw’s letter. Kitchen did not report for work on July 24.\n\n   Finally, following a telephone call from Kitchen’s union represen-\ntative to Superintendent Hodges on July 29, the Jail agreed to waive\nthe requirement that Allied Signal agree to participate in Kitchen’s\nwork release. Kitchen was thus granted work-release privileges effec-\ntive July 30. However, by that time, Allied Signal had discharged\nKitchen. On July 30, Captain Janulyn Lennon, Upshaw’s supervisor,\nwrote to Allied Signal saying that in light of Kitchen’s long term of\nemployment with the company and short time to go until retirement,\nthe Jail was willing to waive the visitation requirement and the\nrequirement that the employer agree to the terms of the Employer’s\nCommunity Work Agreement. Captain Lennon’s letter also expressed\nhope Allied Signal would reinstate Kitchen. Allied Signal wrote back\non August 1, saying the company had reviewed Kitchen’s discharge\nand had decided not to reinstate him.\n\f                            KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                               5\n                                     III.\n\n  At the outset, we should dispose of the Eleventh Amendment\ndefense urged by the Regional Jail Authority.\n\n   The Authority argues that it is an arm of the State for purposes of\nimmunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Although the\ndistrict court expressed no opinion on the question, because the\ndefense may be raised at any time, see Suarez Corp. Industries v.\nMcGraw, 125 F.3d 222 (4th Cir. 1992), we address the question. The\nEleventh Amendment2 limits the Article III jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts to hear cases against States and state officers acting in their\nofficial capacities. Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to\nmere political subdivisions of a State such as counties or municipali-\nties. Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Education v. Doyle, 429\nU.S. 274, 280 (1977) (citing Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529,\n530 (1890)). However, the amendment does confer sovereign immu-\nnity on an arm of the State. Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280. There is\nno clear line separating those state instrumentalities that are entitled\nto sovereign immunity from those that are not, and we follow the\nSupreme Court’s admonition that courts should seek guidance in the\ntwin purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, namely: 1) \"the State’s\nfears that ‘federal courts would force them to pay their Revolutionary\nWar debts, leading to their financial ruin,’\" and 2) \"the integrity\nretained by each State in our federal system.\" Hess v. Port Auth.\nTrans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 39 (1994). Accordingly, the princi-\npal factor to be considered is \"whether a judgment against the govern-\nment entity would have to be paid from the State’s treasury.\" Cash\nv. Greenville County Bd. of Education, 242 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir.\n2001) (citations omitted). This is often the end of the inquiry, for if\nthe \"State treasury will be called upon to pay a judgment against a\ngovernmental entity . . . consideration of any other factor becomes\n  2\n   The Eleventh Amendment provides: \"The Judicial power of the\nUnited States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or\nequity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by\nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\nState.\" Although, by its terms, the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent\na citizen of a state to sue that state in federal court, it has been construed\nto bar such suits. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15 (1890).\n\f6                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\nunnecessary,\" and the entity will be immune. Cash, 242 F.3d at 223.\nA finding to the contrary weighs against immunity. However, even if\nthe state’s treasury will not be used to satisfy a judgment, we still\nmust determine if the relationship of the entity with the state is close\nenough to implicate the \"dignity of the State as a sovereign.\" 242 F.3d\nat 224. We apply three additional factors in this determination: 1) the\ndegree of control that the State exercises over the entity; 2) whether\nthe entity deals with local rather than statewide concerns; and 3) \"the\nmanner in which State law treats the entity.\" 242 F.3d at 224 (cita-\ntions omitted).\n\n   We are of opinion that the Regional Jail Authority is not an arm\nof the State for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity. First,\nand foremost, Virginia’s treasury is not implicated here. The statutory\nscheme that enables municipalities and other political subdivisions to\ncreate these regional authorities also confers on the entity the power\nto sue and be sued in its own name. See Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-\n95.7(11). There is nothing in this section that indicates that a regional\nauthority acts on behalf of the State when it sues or is sued and thus\nobliges the State to pay any judgment rendered against the authority.\nThe Authority argues that the State will have to pay any judgment\nthrough the operation of the Virginia Constitutional Officer Risk\nManagement plan, an insurance program established by the Common-\nwealth. However, we have held that an insurance plan such as this\ndoes not suffice to extend the protection of sovereign immunity to\nindividuals in the case of a municipal Electoral Board, see Sales v.\nGrant, 224 F.3d 293, 297 (4th Cir. 2000), and we are of opinion this\nprinciple should also apply to another local governmental entity, the\nRegional Jail Authority. Cf. Regents of the University of California\nv. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 431 (1997) (\"it is the entity’s potential legal lia-\nbility, rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to\nreimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first instance, that is\nrelevant . . .\").\n\n   None of the other factors militate towards a finding that the\nAuthority is an arm of the State. First, the state law scheme does not\nappear to treat the Authority as an arm of the State. The Authority\nexercises substantial control over its own operations including\nappointing necessary jail officers, agents and employees, and fixing\ntheir compensation. Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-95.7(3). Additionally, the\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                            7\nparticipating political subdivisions must pay their share, from their\ntreasuries, of the costs for land, stock, equipment, and structures. Va.\nCode Ann. § 53.1-106(B). Furthermore, the governing body of the\nAuthority is appointed by the governing bodies of the participating\nlocal political subdivisions, not the Commonwealth. Va. Code Ann.\n§ 53.1-106(A). While it is true that the State pays two-thirds of the\nsuperintendent’s and approved medical treatment personnel’s salary,\nVa. Code Ann. § 53.1-115, we think that this fact alone does not forge\nthe close link between the Authority and the State requisite to impli-\ncate the State’s dignity as a sovereign and thus entitle the Authority\nto sovereign immunity. To the contrary, the retention of substantial\nauthority and control over the construction, governance, and operation\nof the regional authority, as well as the liability for most of the costs\nand expenses, tends to establish that the Authority is an arm of the\nparticipating local political subdivisions. Finally, the statutory\nscheme, by its own terms, provides a mechanism by which municipal-\nities may combine to solve local or regional jailing problems, not\nstatewide ones. Of equally great importance, we think it clear that\nlogic requires that two or more political subdivisions, as here, neither\nof which is entitled to sovereign immunity, may not, without more,\ncombine to create an agency that is entitled to sovereign immunity.\nAccordingly, we are of opinion that the Regional Authority is not\nentitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   Although the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from depriv-\ning an inmate of liberty without due process of law, when a defendant\nis lawfully convicted and confined to jail, he loses a significant inter-\nest in his liberty for the period of his sentence. See Gaston v. Taylor,\n946 F.2d 340, 343 (4th Cir. 1991) (en banc). Additionally, a prison-\ner’s confinement is of necessity subject to the broad discretion of\nthose managing the jail. See Gaston, 946 F.2d at 343. Nonetheless,\nconfinement does not strip an inmate of all liberty interests. See Gas-\nton, 946 F.2d at 343.\n\n   Kitchen alleges that, for several days, the jail officials unconstitu-\ntionally prevented him from participating in work release. To prevail\nin his § 1983 action for deprivation of a liberty interest, Kitchen first\nwould have to demonstrate that prisoners enjoy a protected liberty\n\f8                            KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\ninterest in work release under Virginia law. See Beverati v. Smith, 120\nF.3d 500, 502 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\n   We employ the standard set forth in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S.\n472, 484 (1995), to determine whether state law creates a liberty\ninterest that affords prisoners due process protection. In Sandin, the\nCourt reconsidered its reasoning in previous cases, particularly Hewitt\nv. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), in which the recognition of a liberty\ninterest turned on whether the statute or regulation at issue used man-\ndatory or discretionary language.3 Sandin, 515 U.S. at 480. Such\ninquiries, said the Court, discourage state officials from codifying\ntheir administrative procedures and inappropriately involve federal\ncourts in managing prisons. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. Instead, the\nCourt concluded that States may still create liberty interests that\nafford prisoners due process protections, but explained:\n\n        [T]hese interests will be generally limited to freedom from\n        restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an\n        unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\n        Process Clause of its own force . . ., nonetheless imposes\n        atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n        the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\n515 U.S. at 484. (internal citations omitted). Applying this standard,\nthe Court in Sandin held that an internal prison disciplinary sentence\nof a prisoner to 30 days in segregated confinement did not present the\ntype of \"atypical, significant deprivation\" in which a State might\ncreate a liberty interest. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486.\n\n   Kitchen does not contend that the temporary withholding of per-\nmission to participate in work release gives rise to the protection of\nthe Due Process Clause by its own force. Thus, the question is\n    3\n   In Hewitt, for example, the Court found that Pennsylvania had gone\nbeyond promulgating simple procedural guidelines. Instead, it had used\n\"language of an unmistakably mandatory character, requiring that certain\nprocedures ‘shall,’ ‘will,’ or ‘must’ be employed\" in administrative seg-\nregation determinations. Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472. Such language, said the\nCourt, \"demands a conclusion that the State has created a protected lib-\nerty interest.\" Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472.\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                            9\nwhether denial of work-release status imposed on Kitchen an \"atypi-\ncal and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n\n   Two cases from our sister circuits have, under Sandin, rejected the\ncontention that once an inmate has been given work release he\nthereby acquires a liberty interest in retaining that status. In Domi-\nnique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156 (1st Cir. 1996), an inmate was, for vari-\nous penalogical reasons, summarily removed from a work-release\nprogram and sent to a medium security prison after having success-\nfully participated in work release for four years. The First Circuit held\nthat because confinement within the prison walls of the medium\nsecurity prison was an ordinary incident of prison life, the prisoner\ndid not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in work\nrelease. See Dominique, 73 F.3d at 1160. Likewise, in Callender v.\nSioux City Residential Treatment Facility, 88 F.3d 666 (8th Cir.\n1996), the inmate’s work-release status was revoked when he refused\nto admit his crime, a condition of maintaining work-release status.\nReasoning that the inmate was returned to the same facility from\nwhich he had left upon being granted work release several months\nbefore, the court found revocation of his work-release status imposed\nneither an atypical nor a significant deprivation. See Callender, 88\nF.3d at 669.\n\n   Kitchen, in the case at hand, was not removed from a work-release\nprogram; he was merely denied permission to participate in one.\nThus, Kitchen essentially claims he suffered a constitutionally signifi-\ncant deprivation in not being granted work release by the jail officials\nwho were authorized by statute and by court order to determine\nwhether he was eligible for such a program. We take judicial notice\nof the fact that there is nothing atypical about prisoners being denied\npermission to leave jail in order to work. Thus, we hold that under\nVirginia law prisoners have no constitutionally protected liberty inter-\nest in work release.\n\n   Neither side has depended on Sandin; instead, they apparently\nassume that the type of inquiry rejected in Sandin would be control-\nling here. However, even under a pre-Sandin analysis we find that\nVirginia law has not created a constitutionally protected liberty inter-\nest in initial work-release determinations.\n\f10                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\n   Using that analysis, we have previously held that prisoners do not\nenjoy a liberty interest in work release under Virginia law. See Gas-\nton v. Taylor, 946 F.2d 340, 344 (4th Cir. 1991) (en banc). In Gaston,\nwe examined Virginia’s work-release statute and found that instead\nof creating an entitlement, Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-60(A) gives the\nDirector of the Department of Corrections discretion to approve\ninmates for the program. See Gaston, 946 F.2d at 344.\n\n   Kitchen attempts to distinguish Gaston by pointing out that the sen-\ntencing judge in this case authorized Kitchen’s work release under\nVa. Code Ann. § 53.1-131(A), a section not construed in Gaston. In\neffect, he argues that, under § 53.1-131(A), once a court orders that\nan inmate may participate, jail officials are unable then to deny the\ninmate permission to be released for work. Kitchen also argues that\nthe sentencing judge’s order itself employed mandatory language\nwhich removed all discretion from jail officials once Kitchen paid his\ncourt costs and fines, and that jail officials \"willfully and deliberately\"\nviolated that court order.\n\n   Under § 53.1-131(A), a court may, \"if it appears to the court that\n[an] offender is a suitable candidate for work release, assign the\noffender to a work release program under the supervision of . . . the\nadministrator of a local or regional jail . . . .\" We note, however, that\n§ 53.1-131(A) also states that \"[t]he Board [of Corrections] shall pre-\nscribe regulations to govern the work release . . . programs authorized\nby this section.\" Thus, under a pre-Sandin analysis, § 53.1-131(A)\nwould not have required that we change the view expressed in Gaston\nthat inmates have no liberty interest in the initial work-release deter-\nmination.\n\n   Furthermore, it is not the case that, as Kitchen argues, the sentenc-\ning judge in his case \"specifically authorized work release for Kitchen\nupon payments of the fines and court costs.\" To support his claim that\npayment of fines and costs was the only prerequisite for an entitle-\nment to work release, Kitchen cites to a disposition notice apparently\nissued by the circuit court clerk’s office. The handwritten notation to\nwhich Kitchen refers says that costs must be paid in full \"for work\nrelease eligibility.\" It may be unclear whether the clerk indicated pay-\nment of costs was a sufficient condition or was instead merely a nec-\nessary condition for Kitchen’s work release. However, what the clerk\n\f                           KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                             11\nindicated on the disposition notice is irrelevant here. It is well estab-\nlished that Virginia trial courts speak only through their written\norders. See Fredericksburg Const. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc.,\n530 S.E.2d 148, 152 (Va. 2000). In this case, after fining Kitchen and\nsentencing him to a term in jail, the court’s order read as follows:\n\n      The Court authorizes that the defendant may participate in\n      a work release program if he is eligible. The defendant must\n      further pay court costs on this charge of $128.00. (emphasis\n      added).\n\nThus, even if payment was a condition of work release, the plain lan-\nguage of the court’s order did not make payment of costs and fines\nthe only condition for work release. Instead, the court’s order obvi-\nously contemplated Jail officials would make an independent determi-\nnation of Kitchen’s eligibility.\n\n    Kitchen also seems to argue that he met all of the Jail’s eligibility\nrequirements for work release and that he therefore was entitled to\nwork release. However, under a pre-Sandin analysis, it would be irrel-\nevant were Kitchen to have met all of the eligibility criteria used to\npre-screen inmates. This is so because the Jail’s SOPs state that \"if\nit is determined that an individual is eligible for work release, he/she\nmay be placed in the program\" (emphasis added). This is not the kind\nof mandatory language identified as dispositive in Hewitt. Addition-\nally, the SOPs make it a requirement of the eligibility investigation\nthat \"the employer must sign and return the [Employer’s Community\nWork Agreement] form to the Coordinator.\"4 Allied Signal declined\nto sign the form, and jail officials, in compliance with their SOPs,\ntherefore identified Kitchen as ineligible for work release.\n  4\n   We note that the Jail’s SOPs also provide that when the jail finds an\ninmate ineligible for work release, a letter of explanation will be submit-\nted to the sentencing judge who ordered work release. The sentencing\njudge then may subsequently order that the inmate be placed on work\nrelease irrespective of the Jail’s determination of ineligibility. Upshaw\ndid notify the sentencing judge of Kitchen’s ineligibility for work\nrelease, citing Allied Signal’s refusal to cooperate. There is no indication\nthat the sentencing judge saw fit to order Kitchen be granted work\nrelease despite the Jail’s finding of ineligibility.\n\f12                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\n   Finally, because the SOPs, in certain instances, provide for \"due\nprocess\" hearings before an inmate is removed from work release for\nviolation of rules, Kitchen argues that those same protections there-\nfore attach to the initial determination of work-release eligibility.\nAlthough we need not and do not decide whether, under Virginia law,\na protected liberty interest attaches once an inmate is granted work-\nrelease status, even the pre-Sandin analysis recognized \"the crucial\ndistinction between being deprived of a liberty one has . . . and being\ndenied the conditional liberty that one desires.\" Greenholtz v. Inmates\nof the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 9\n(1979) (rejecting such an argument in context of parole determina-\ntions).\n\n   Thus, even by engaging in the pre-Sandin analysis Kitchen urges\non us, he still fails to show any evidence that the jail officials’ discre-\ntion was limited by the court’s order or the statutes and regulations\nat issue in this case.\n\n                                    V.\n\n   Finally, Sandin clearly mandates that we find prisoners enjoy a\nprotected liberty interest only when an inmate can demonstrate he suf-\nfered an \"atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Although the court\nis not unsympathetic to Mr. Kitchen’s loss of employment, it is clear\nthat being denied permission to leave jail in order to work is nothing\nmore than an ordinary experience of inmates. Therefore, we hold\nKitchen enjoyed no constitutionally protected liberty interest in work\nrelease.\n\n                                   VI.\n\n   The district court held that the individual defendants as individuals\nwere each protected by qualified immunity and, as well, granted sum-\nmary judgment to the individual defendants in their official capacities.\nIt also granted summary judgment to the Regional Jail Authority.\n\n   As we have just explained, there is no merit to the claim that the\nplaintiff had a Constitutionally protected liberty interest in the work\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                          13\nrelease program. That being true, the order of the district court grant-\ning qualified immunity to the individual defendants as individuals is\nlikewise correct. Slattery v. Rizzo, 939 F.2d 213, 216 (4th Cir. 1991)\n(holding that such a deprivation of a Constitutional right must be\nclearly established which, of course, it was not here, being non-\nexistent).\n\n  The judgment of the district court is accordingly\n\n                                                         AFFIRMED.5\n  5\n   The City of Colonial Heights was a party to the complaint but was\ndismissed from the case on May 26, 1999. Exception is not taken on\nappeal to that order.\n\f",

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at\n249.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   The undisputed facts of this case follow. On July 15, 1997, in the\ncircuit court of Colonial Heights, Virginia, Ronnell Kitchen (Kitchen)\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                           3\npleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges of driving under the influ-\nence of intoxicants and driving on a suspended license. Kitchen was\nfined and sentenced to a jail term. The sentencing judge’s order also\ncontained the following:\n\n      The Court authorizes that the defendant may participate in\n      a work release program if he is eligible. The defendant must\n      further pay court costs on this charge of $128.00.\n\nKitchen’s brother-in-law, David Resnick, paid in full Kitchen’s fines\nand court costs that same day. Also that same day, Kitchen was com-\nmitted to the Riverside Regional Jail (Jail).\n\n   Sergeant Douglas Upshaw (Upshaw), a defendant in this action,\nwas the work-release coordinator for the Jail. On July 16, Upshaw\ninterviewed Kitchen, and Kitchen signed a \"Work and Education\nRelease Program Rules\" form. Kitchen also submitted a handwritten\nstatement, explaining that he had a strong desire to participate in the\nwork-release program because he had worked for Allied Signal for\ntwenty-four years, because he had four more years to go until retire-\nment, and because he would be fired if he missed five days of work.\nOn the same day as the interview, Upshaw sent by facsimile to Allied\nSignal a copy of the \"Employer’s Community Work Agreement,\" a\nform requiring the employer’s signature and imposing certain condi-\ntions on employers participating in work release.1 The fax to Allied\nSignal was marked \"Urgent\" and \"Reply ASAP.\"\n\n   Allied Signal did not respond to Upshaw’s fax. On July 17th,\nUpshaw then telephoned Allied Signal to discuss the company’s will-\ningness to participate in the program. Officials at Allied Signal, how-\never, expressed reservations about participating in Kitchen’s work\nrelease. Allied Signal did not want, for example, law enforcement\nofficials to come onto the work site to monitor Kitchen. Upshaw\nresponded that he would not need to speak with Kitchen at the work\nsite but would only need to see him there, perhaps through a window.\n  1\n    Allied Signal, for example, would have been required immediately to\ninform the Work Release Coordinator of any changes in Kitchen’s job\nstatus, to submit in advance his weekly work schedule, and to verify the\nnumber of hours he actually worked.\n\f4                        KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\nAllied officials told Upshaw that they wanted more time to consider\nthe matter and that they would contact him on July 18th with their\ndecision.\n\n   Not having heard back from Allied Signal, Upshaw again tele-\nphoned the company on Monday, July 21. That call apparently went\nunreturned. Instead, on July 23, Upshaw received a letter from an\nofficial at Allied Signal who said that company policy was not to par-\nticipate in work-release programs. The letter went on to say that\nKitchen was welcome to return to work under the previous conditions\nof his employment—if he could do so by July 24—but that, in effect,\nthe company would not cooperate with the Jail in supervising\nKitchen.\n\n   On July 23, pursuant to the Jail’s Standard Operating Procedures,\nknown as SOPs, Upshaw sent a letter to the sentencing judge explain-\ning Allied Signal’s refusal to participate and reporting that Kitchen\nwas therefore denied work-release privileges. In the letter, Upshaw\nalso asked the sentencing judge whether Kitchen should be granted\nwork release despite Allied Signal’s refusal to participate and also\napparently enclosed a copy of Allied Signal’s letter of July 23. There\nis no evidence in the record that the judge ever responded to\nUpshaw’s letter. Kitchen did not report for work on July 24.\n\n   Finally, following a telephone call from Kitchen’s union represen-\ntative to Superintendent Hodges on July 29, the Jail agreed to waive\nthe requirement that Allied Signal agree to participate in Kitchen’s\nwork release. Kitchen was thus granted work-release privileges effec-\ntive July 30. However, by that time, Allied Signal had discharged\nKitchen. On July 30, Captain Janulyn Lennon, Upshaw’s supervisor,\nwrote to Allied Signal saying that in light of Kitchen’s long term of\nemployment with the company and short time to go until retirement,\nthe Jail was willing to waive the visitation requirement and the\nrequirement that the employer agree to the terms of the Employer’s\nCommunity Work Agreement. Captain Lennon’s letter also expressed\nhope Allied Signal would reinstate Kitchen. Allied Signal wrote back\non August 1, saying the company had reviewed Kitchen’s discharge\nand had decided not to reinstate him.\n\f                            KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                               5\n                                     III.\n\n  At the outset, we should dispose of the Eleventh Amendment\ndefense urged by the Regional Jail Authority.\n\n   The Authority argues that it is an arm of the State for purposes of\nimmunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Although the\ndistrict court expressed no opinion on the question, because the\ndefense may be raised at any time, see Suarez Corp. Industries v.\nMcGraw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1992), we address the question. The\nEleventh Amendment2 limits the Article III jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts to hear cases against States and state officers acting in their\nofficial capacities. Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to\nmere political subdivisions of a State such as counties or municipali-\nties. Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Education v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (1977) (citing Lincoln County v.

However, the amendment does confer sovereign immu-\nnity on an arm of the State. Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280. There is\nno clear line separating those state instrumentalities that are entitled\nto sovereign immunity from those that are not, and we follow the\nSupreme Court’s admonition that courts should seek guidance in the\ntwin purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, namely: 1) \"the State’s\nfears that ‘federal courts would force them to pay their Revolutionary\nWar debts, leading to their financial ruin,’\" and 2) \"the integrity\nretained by each State in our federal system.\" Hess v. Port Auth.\nTrans-Hudson Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117880\"><a href=\"/opinion/117880/hess-v-port-authority-trans-hudson-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (1994). Accordingly, the princi-\npal factor to be considered is \"whether a judgment against the govern-\nment entity would have to be paid from the State’s treasury.\" Cash\nv. Greenville County Bd. of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772341\"><a href=\"/opinion/772341/mary-cash-v-granville-county-board-of-education-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (4th Cir.\n2001) (citations omitted). This is often the end of the inquiry, for if\nthe \"State treasury will be called upon to pay a judgment against a\ngovernmental entity . . . consideration of any other factor becomes\n  2\n   The Eleventh Amendment provides: \"The Judicial power of the\nUnited States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or\nequity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by\nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\nState.\" Although, by its terms, the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent\na citizen of a state to sue that state in federal court, it has been construed\nto bar such suits. See Hans v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92702\"><a href=\"/opinion/92702/hans-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1890).\n\f6                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\nunnecessary,\" and the entity will be immune. Cash, 242 F.3d at 223.\nA finding to the contrary weighs against immunity. However, even if\nthe state’s treasury will not be used to satisfy a judgment, we still\nmust determine if the relationship of the entity with the state is close\nenough to implicate the \"dignity of the State as a sovereign.\" 242 F.3d\nat 224. We apply three additional factors in this determination: 1) the\ndegree of control that the State exercises over the entity; 2) whether\nthe entity deals with local rather than statewide concerns; and 3) \"the\nmanner in which State law treats the entity.\" 242 F.3d at 224 (cita-\ntions omitted).\n\n   We are of opinion that the Regional Jail Authority is not an arm\nof the State for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity. First,\nand foremost, Virginia’s treasury is not implicated here. The statutory\nscheme that enables municipalities and other political subdivisions to\ncreate these regional authorities also confers on the entity the power\nto sue and be sued in its own name. See Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-\n95.7(11). There is nothing in this section that indicates that a regional\nauthority acts on behalf of the State when it sues or is sued and thus\nobliges the State to pay any judgment rendered against the authority.\nThe Authority argues that the State will have to pay any judgment\nthrough the operation of the Virginia Constitutional Officer Risk\nManagement plan, an insurance program established by the Common-\nwealth. However, we have held that an insurance plan such as this\ndoes not suffice to extend the protection of sovereign immunity to\nindividuals in the case of a municipal Electoral Board, see Sales v.\nGrant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770127\"><a href=\"/opinion/770127/inez-sales-debra-m-miller-v-alphonso-l-grant-in-his-individual-capacity/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 (4th Cir. 2000), and we are of opinion this\nprinciple should also apply to another local governmental entity, the\nRegional Jail Authority. Cf. Regents of the University of California\nv. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118087\"><a href=\"/opinion/118087/regents-of-univ-of-cal-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431 (1997) (\"it is the entity’s potential legal lia-\nbility, rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to\nreimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first instance, that is\nrelevant . . .\").\n\n   None of the other factors militate towards a finding that the\nAuthority is an arm of the State. First, the state law scheme does not\nappear to treat the Authority as an arm of the State. The Authority\nexercises substantial control over its own operations including\nappointing necessary jail officers, agents and employees, and fixing\ntheir compensation. Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-95.7(3). Additionally, the\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                            7\nparticipating political subdivisions must pay their share, from their\ntreasuries, of the costs for land, stock, equipment, and structures. Va.\nCode Ann. § 53.1-106(B). Furthermore, the governing body of the\nAuthority is appointed by the governing bodies of the participating\nlocal political subdivisions, not the Commonwealth. Va. Code Ann.\n§ 53.1-106(A). While it is true that the State pays two-thirds of the\nsuperintendent’s and approved medical treatment personnel’s salary,\nVa. Code Ann. § 53.1-115, we think that this fact alone does not forge\nthe close link between the Authority and the State requisite to impli-\ncate the State’s dignity as a sovereign and thus entitle the Authority\nto sovereign immunity. To the contrary, the retention of substantial\nauthority and control over the construction, governance, and operation\nof the regional authority, as well as the liability for most of the costs\nand expenses, tends to establish that the Authority is an arm of the\nparticipating local political subdivisions. Finally, the statutory\nscheme, by its own terms, provides a mechanism by which municipal-\nities may combine to solve local or regional jailing problems, not\nstatewide ones. Of equally great importance, we think it clear that\nlogic requires that two or more political subdivisions, as here, neither\nof which is entitled to sovereign immunity, may not, without more,\ncombine to create an agency that is entitled to sovereign immunity.\nAccordingly, we are of opinion that the Regional Authority is not\nentitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   Although the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from depriv-\ning an inmate of liberty without due process of law, when a defendant\nis lawfully convicted and confined to jail, he loses a significant inter-\nest in his liberty for the period of his sentence. See Gaston v. Taylor,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569318\"><a href=\"/opinion/569318/zeb-gaston-v-john-b-taylor-warden-samuel-pruett-assistant-warden-toni/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (4th Cir. 1991) (en banc). Additionally, a prison-\ner’s confinement is of necessity subject to the broad discretion of\nthose managing the jail. See Gaston, 946 F.2d at 343. Nonetheless,\nconfinement does not strip an inmate of all liberty interests. See Gas-\nton, 946 F.2d at 343.\n\n   Kitchen alleges that, for several days, the jail officials unconstitu-\ntionally prevented him from participating in work release. To prevail\nin his § 1983 action for deprivation of a liberty interest, Kitchen first\nwould have to demonstrate that prisoners enjoy a protected liberty\n\f8                            KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\ninterest in work release under Virginia law. See Beverati v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744503\"><a href=\"/opinion/744503/brian-beverati-emil-van-aelst-v-sewall-smith-warden-maryland-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\n   We employ the standard set forth in Sandin v.

Such\ninquiries, said the Court, discourage state officials from codifying\ntheir administrative procedures and inappropriately involve federal\ncourts in managing prisons. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482. Instead, the\nCourt concluded that States may still create liberty interests that\nafford prisoners due process protections, but explained:\n\n        [T]hese interests will be generally limited to freedom from\n        restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an\n        unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\n        Process Clause of its own force . . ., nonetheless imposes\n        atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n        the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\n515 U.S. at 484. (internal citations omitted). Applying this standard,\nthe Court in Sandin held that an internal prison disciplinary sentence\nof a prisoner to 30 days in segregated confinement did not present the\ntype of \"atypical, significant deprivation\" in which a State might\ncreate a liberty interest. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486.\n\n   Kitchen does not contend that the temporary withholding of per-\nmission to participate in work release gives rise to the protection of\nthe Due Process Clause by its own force. Thus, the question is\n    3\n   In Hewitt, for example, the Court found that Pennsylvania had gone\nbeyond promulgating simple procedural guidelines. Instead, it had used\n\"language of an unmistakably mandatory character, requiring that certain\nprocedures ‘shall,’ ‘will,’ or ‘must’ be employed\" in administrative seg-\nregation determinations. Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472. Such language, said the\nCourt, \"demands a conclusion that the State has created a protected lib-\nerty interest.\" Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472.\n\f                          KITCHEN v.

The First Circuit held\nthat because confinement within the prison walls of the medium\nsecurity prison was an ordinary incident of prison life, the prisoner\ndid not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in work\nrelease. See Dominique, 73 F.3d at 1160. Likewise, in Callender v.\nSioux City Residential Treatment Facility, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721387\"><a href=\"/opinion/721387/james-donald-callender-v-sioux-city-residential-treatment-facility-steve/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1996), the inmate’s work-release status was revoked when he refused\nto admit his crime, a condition of maintaining work-release status.\nReasoning that the inmate was returned to the same facility from\nwhich he had left upon being granted work release several months\nbefore, the court found revocation of his work-release status imposed\nneither an atypical nor a significant deprivation. See Callender, 88\nF.3d at 669.\n\n   Kitchen, in the case at hand, was not removed from a work-release\nprogram; he was merely denied permission to participate in one.\nThus, Kitchen essentially claims he suffered a constitutionally signifi-\ncant deprivation in not being granted work release by the jail officials\nwho were authorized by statute and by court order to determine\nwhether he was eligible for such a program. We take judicial notice\nof the fact that there is nothing atypical about prisoners being denied\npermission to leave jail in order to work. Thus, we hold that under\nVirginia law prisoners have no constitutionally protected liberty inter-\nest in work release.\n\n   Neither side has depended on Sandin; instead, they apparently\nassume that the type of inquiry rejected in Sandin would be control-\nling here. However, even under a pre-Sandin analysis we find that\nVirginia law has not created a constitutionally protected liberty inter-\nest in initial work-release determinations.\n\f10                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\n   Using that analysis, we have previously held that prisoners do not\nenjoy a liberty interest in work release under Virginia law. See Gas-\nton v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569318\"><a href=\"/opinion/569318/zeb-gaston-v-john-b-taylor-warden-samuel-pruett-assistant-warden-toni/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 344 (4th Cir. 1991) (en banc). In Gaston,\nwe examined Virginia’s work-release statute and found that instead\nof creating an entitlement, Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-60(A) gives the\nDirector of the Department of Corrections discretion to approve\ninmates for the program. See Gaston, 946 F.2d at 344.\n\n   Kitchen attempts to distinguish Gaston by pointing out that the sen-\ntencing judge in this case authorized Kitchen’s work release under\nVa. Code Ann. § 53.1-131(A), a section not construed in Gaston. In\neffect, he argues that, under § 53.1-131(A), once a court orders that\nan inmate may participate, jail officials are unable then to deny the\ninmate permission to be released for work. Kitchen also argues that\nthe sentencing judge’s order itself employed mandatory language\nwhich removed all discretion from jail officials once Kitchen paid his\ncourt costs and fines, and that jail officials \"willfully and deliberately\"\nviolated that court order.\n\n   Under § 53.1-131(A), a court may, \"if it appears to the court that\n[an] offender is a suitable candidate for work release, assign the\noffender to a work release program under the supervision of . . . the\nadministrator of a local or regional jail . . . .\" We note, however, that\n§ 53.1-131(A) also states that \"[t]he Board [of Corrections] shall pre-\nscribe regulations to govern the work release . . . programs authorized\nby this section.\" Thus, under a pre-Sandin analysis, § 53.1-131(A)\nwould not have required that we change the view expressed in Gaston\nthat inmates have no liberty interest in the initial work-release deter-\nmination.\n\n   Furthermore, it is not the case that, as Kitchen argues, the sentenc-\ning judge in his case \"specifically authorized work release for Kitchen\nupon payments of the fines and court costs.\" To support his claim that\npayment of fines and costs was the only prerequisite for an entitle-\nment to work release, Kitchen cites to a disposition notice apparently\nissued by the circuit court clerk’s office. The handwritten notation to\nwhich Kitchen refers says that costs must be paid in full \"for work\nrelease eligibility.\" It may be unclear whether the clerk indicated pay-\nment of costs was a sufficient condition or was instead merely a nec-\nessary condition for Kitchen’s work release. However, what the clerk\n\f                           KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                             11\nindicated on the disposition notice is irrelevant here. It is well estab-\nlished that Virginia trial courts speak only through their written\norders. See Fredericksburg Const. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1059598\"><a href=\"/opinion/1059598/fredericksburg-const-v-wyne-excavating/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (Va. 2000). In this case, after fining Kitchen and\nsentencing him to a term in jail, the court’s order read as follows:\n\n      The Court authorizes that the defendant may participate in\n      a work release program if he is eligible. The defendant must\n      further pay court costs on this charge of $128.00. (emphasis\n      added).\n\nThus, even if payment was a condition of work release, the plain lan-\nguage of the court’s order did not make payment of costs and fines\nthe only condition for work release. Instead, the court’s order obvi-\nously contemplated Jail officials would make an independent determi-\nnation of Kitchen’s eligibility.\n\n    Kitchen also seems to argue that he met all of the Jail’s eligibility\nrequirements for work release and that he therefore was entitled to\nwork release. However, under a pre-Sandin analysis, it would be irrel-\nevant were Kitchen to have met all of the eligibility criteria used to\npre-screen inmates. This is so because the Jail’s SOPs state that \"if\nit is determined that an individual is eligible for work release, he/she\nmay be placed in the program\" (emphasis added). This is not the kind\nof mandatory language identified as dispositive in Hewitt. Addition-\nally, the SOPs make it a requirement of the eligibility investigation\nthat \"the employer must sign and return the [Employer’s Community\nWork Agreement] form to the Coordinator.\"4 Allied Signal declined\nto sign the form, and jail officials, in compliance with their SOPs,\ntherefore identified Kitchen as ineligible for work release.\n  4\n   We note that the Jail’s SOPs also provide that when the jail finds an\ninmate ineligible for work release, a letter of explanation will be submit-\nted to the sentencing judge who ordered work release. The sentencing\njudge then may subsequently order that the inmate be placed on work\nrelease irrespective of the Jail’s determination of ineligibility. Upshaw\ndid notify the sentencing judge of Kitchen’s ineligibility for work\nrelease, citing Allied Signal’s refusal to cooperate. There is no indication\nthat the sentencing judge saw fit to order Kitchen be granted work\nrelease despite the Jail’s finding of ineligibility.\n\f12                         KITCHEN v. UPSHAW\n   Finally, because the SOPs, in certain instances, provide for \"due\nprocess\" hearings before an inmate is removed from work release for\nviolation of rules, Kitchen argues that those same protections there-\nfore attach to the initial determination of work-release eligibility.\nAlthough we need not and do not decide whether, under Virginia law,\na protected liberty interest attaches once an inmate is granted work-\nrelease status, even the pre-Sandin analysis recognized \"the crucial\ndistinction between being deprived of a liberty one has . . . and being\ndenied the conditional liberty that one desires.\" Greenholtz v. Inmates\nof the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110085\"><a href=\"/opinion/110085/greenholtz-v-inmates-of-neb-penal-and-correctional-complex/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9\n(1979) (rejecting such an argument in context of parole determina-\ntions).\n\n   Thus, even by engaging in the pre-Sandin analysis Kitchen urges\non us, he still fails to show any evidence that the jail officials’ discre-\ntion was limited by the court’s order or the statutes and regulations\nat issue in this case.\n\n                                    V.\n\n   Finally, Sandin clearly mandates that we find prisoners enjoy a\nprotected liberty interest only when an inmate can demonstrate he suf-\nfered an \"atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Although the court\nis not unsympathetic to Mr. Kitchen’s loss of employment, it is clear\nthat being denied permission to leave jail in order to work is nothing\nmore than an ordinary experience of inmates. Therefore, we hold\nKitchen enjoyed no constitutionally protected liberty interest in work\nrelease.\n\n                                   VI.\n\n   The district court held that the individual defendants as individuals\nwere each protected by qualified immunity and, as well, granted sum-\nmary judgment to the individual defendants in their official capacities.\nIt also granted summary judgment to the Regional Jail Authority.\n\n   As we have just explained, there is no merit to the claim that the\nplaintiff had a Constitutionally protected liberty interest in the work\n\f                          KITCHEN v. UPSHAW                          13\nrelease program. That being true, the order of the district court grant-\ning qualified immunity to the individual defendants as individuals is\nlikewise correct.
