This contention lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties on the same cause of action.   Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979).   Res judicata applies to claims brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.   See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 96-97 (1980).  \"[W]here the federal constitutional claim is based on the same asserted wrong as was the subject of a state action, and where the parties are the same res judicata will bar the federal constitutional claim whether it is asserted in state court or not....\"   Scoggin v.

Alaska Dep't of Corrections, 816 P.2d 134, 138 (Alaska 1991).   An unnamed member of a class cannot make a collateral attack on the class action judgment where the class members received adequate representation.   Id.  \"The question of adequate representation can best be resolved by determining whether the interests of those who would attack the judgment were vigorously pursued and protected in the class action by qualified counsel.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in his section 1983 complaint, Stumpf asserted that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by placing him in administrative segregation or solitary confinement without a hearing and improperly restricting his telephone and visitation privileges, law library access, and ability to practice his religion.   Stumpf is barred from relitigating these claims because he was a member of the class of plaintiffs who won a judgment against the same defendants in a comprehensive prison conditions case in the Alaska state courts.   The claims that Stumpf raised in this action either were raised or could have been raised in the class action and subsequent state court actions.   Moreover, Stumpf received adequate representation in the class action because the class was represented by qualified counsel who obtained a judgment for both injunctive and monetary relief.   Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that Stumpf's section 1983 action is barred by res judicata.
