On the merits, LTC contends that the auditor overvalued its\nproperty by predicating his cost-based valuation on the cost schedule for nursing\nhomes and private hospitals rather than on the cost schedule for apartment\nbuildings with 20 to 39 rental units. LTC hypothesizes that had the auditor used\nthe cost schedule for apartments as a starting point, his ultimate conclusion of\nvalue would have been lower. In addition, LTC alleges a procedural error in the\nBTA’s denial of LTC’s request for a continuance of the evidentiary hearing.\n        {¶ 2} Because we disagree with both of LTC’s arguments, we affirm the\ndecision of the BTA.\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                          Facts\n       {¶ 3} For tax year 2007, the Licking County auditor, an appellee,\nassigned a true value of $1,975,000 to Chestnut House Assisted Living, which\nconsists of 2.43 acres, improved with a 25,824 square-foot building and a paved\nparking area.    The auditor’s land value was $307,400, and the value of\nimprovements was $1,667,600.        The property record card indicates that the\nauditor used the “nursing home” cost schedule, which attributed a cost-based\nvalue of $92.50 per square foot for the building. The county also applied a grade-\nfactor adjustment of 110 percent, to derive a “replacement-cost-new” figure of\n$2,627,590. Next, the county applied a 25 percent reduction for obsolescence,\nwhich led to a cost-less-depreciation figure of $1,970,694 for the building.\n       {¶ 4} But obsolescence was merely one adjustment. The actual amount\nof cost value assigned to the building was $1,653,130 (i.e., $1,667,600 minus the\ncost of the paved area, which was $14,470). That number reflects a substantial\nreduction from the $1,970,694 figure previously determined to be the cost-less-\ndepreciation associated with the facility.        Thus, the auditor’s obsolescence\nadjustment, together with additional adjustments, lowered the original square-\nfootage computation by 37 percent—from $2,627,590 to $1,653,130. Indeed, the\nvaluation of the building represents almost a 31 percent reduction from the figure\nderived by multiplying the nursing-home cost figure of $92.50 per square foot by\nthe 25,824 square feet of the building.\n       {¶ 5} Appellant, LTC Properties, Inc., filed a valuation complaint on\nMarch 24, 2008, with the BOR, seeking a reduced value of $1,000,000. The\nNewark City Schools Board of Education (“school board”) filed a\ncountercomplaint on April 28, and the BOR held a hearing on May 20, 2008.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f                                     January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 6} At the hearing, LTC presented the testimony1 of William\nMcVeigh, the property tax manager for Assisted Living Concepts, the parent of\nLTC. McVeigh asserted that Chestnut House is an assisted-living facility with 39\nefficiency-apartments, 38 of which were then occupied. McVeigh offered an\nincome-capitalization analysis that estimated the facility’s value at $54 per square\nfoot, for a true value of approximately $1,380,000 for the facility as a whole. The\nauditor’s valuation of $1,975,000, by contrast, reflects a valuation of some $76\nper square foot. On cross-examination, McVeigh explained that the rent number\nwas generated by market-driven surveys “for this specific purpose.” McVeigh\nalso distinguished the $1,200 to $1,800 per month that residents actually pay as\n“service fees,” only a portion of which can properly be characterized as rent that\nrelates to the value of the realty. Additionally, McVeigh contested the propriety\nof the auditor’s using the nursing-home and private-hospital category for cost-\nvaluation purposes.        On cross-examination, McVeigh conceded that he was\nneither an employee nor an owner of the taxpayer and that he was not a certified\nappraiser.\n        {¶ 7} By order dated July 3, 2008, the BOR retained the auditor’s\nvaluation of the property, and LTC appealed to the BTA on July 10, 2008. On\nNovember 14, 2008, the school board filed a motion to compel discovery of\nLTC’s witnesses and exhibits, which recited that the school board had served\ninterrogatories and document requests on LTC on September 12 and had followed\nup with LTC twice. On December 9, 2008, the BTA denied the motion to compel\non the grounds that it had been filed more than 120 days after the filing of the\nappeal, which is outside the time limit for seeking the board’s involvement in\n\n\n1. The BOR hearing was transcribed by a court reporter, and the transcript does not show that\nMcVeigh was sworn. Nor does the transcript show any objection to his giving unsworn testimony.\nWe will regard the absence of an objection to the testimony on account of the witness’s not having\nbeen sworn as a waiver of the point. See Stores Realty Co. v. Cleveland, 41 Ohio St.2d 41, 43,\n322 N.E.2d 629 (1975).\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndiscovery pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11.           But the BTA order also\nadmonished LTC that ignoring the discovery request could lead to exclusion of its\nevidence.\n       {¶ 8} The BTA set the case for hearing on April 5, 2010. The county\nand the school board filed disclosures of witnesses and/or exhibits on March 19\nand 22, 2010, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(I), which requires such\ndisclosure at least 14 days before the scheduled hearing. LTC made no such\ndisclosures. Then, on March 26, 2010, 10 days before the scheduled hearing,\nLTC sent a letter requesting continuance of the hearing. The letter tersely stated,\n“Our appraiser is Richard Racek” and that he was “unavailable on [April 5],”\nwithout offering any reason for the appraiser’s unavailability or for the failure to\ndisclose the appraiser and his report previously. On March 29, the county filed a\nmemorandum opposing the continuance, to which LTC responded on March 30.\n       {¶ 9} By order dated March 30, 2010, the BTA denied the continuance.\nThe BTA noted that LTC had ignored discovery and that the school board’s\nwitness disclosure had objected to any witnesses or exhibits for LTC because of\nLTC’s disregard of the discovery requests seeking that very information. The\nBTA next noted that LTC was in violation of both the 14-day disclosure rule and\ndivision (C) of Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15, which requires a continuance request\nto be filed no later than 14 days before the scheduled hearing. Based on the\nmultiple rule violations and the failure to state good cause, the BTA denied the\ncontinuance. With respect to the request that LTC witnesses and exhibits be\nexcluded, the BTA deferred judgment.\n       {¶ 10} The three parties—LTC, the county, and the school board—\nappeared through counsel at the April 5 hearing. Counsel for LTC read aloud\nportions of McVeigh’s testimony to the BOR and presented two exhibits, one\nshowing cost per square foot used by the county for apartments, the other showing\nproperty record cards of other assisted-living facilities. The BTA received the\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nexhibits over objection of the county and the school board. The BTA then\nentertained briefs from the parties.\n       {¶ 11} On June 7, 2011, the BTA issued its decision. As for McVeigh’s\npresentation to the BOR, the BTA declined to adopt his conclusions because\n“there is no data included to support the conclusions reached.” LTC Properties,\nInc. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, BTA No. 2008-A-1010, 2011 WL 2306065,\n*2 (June 7, 2011). With respect to LTC’s contention that the auditor should have\nused the apartment cost schedules as the starting point, the BTA held that\nalthough it had in the past “adopted, at least in part, many appraisals of assisted\nliving facilities that have relied upon comparisons of the subject facilities to\napartment complexes, there is no requirement that such comparisons be made.”\nId., *4. Acknowledging that “the particular code that a county assigns to a\nproperty may impact its valuation, it is clearly not the only factor that determines\nthe valuation to be assigned,” and as a result, “any appraisal of an assisted living\nfacility that is based on rates attributable to an alternative code may require\nadjustments, which it appears were made by the county herein.” Id., *5. The\nBTA found that LTC had “failed to demonstrate that the value which it seeks has\na basis in the market, as of the tax lien date in question” and that the taxpayer had\nthereby not satisfied its burden of proof. Id. Accordingly, the BTA retained the\ncounty’s valuation. Id. We now affirm.\n                                       Analysis\n       {¶ 12} Because the true value of property is a “question of fact, the\ndetermination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities,”\nwe have held that we will “not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals\nwith respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that\nsuch decision is unreasonable or unlawful.” Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision v.\nFodor, 15 Ohio St.2d 52, 239 N.E.2d 25 (1968), syllabus. Moreover, because the\nBTA as the finder of fact has “wide discretion in granting weight to evidence and\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncredibility to witnesses,” we will not reverse the BTA’s determination of\nevidentiary weight and credibility “unless we find an abuse of this discretion.”\nNatl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, 73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398,\n653 N.E.2d 240 (1995).\n                   1. The BTA did not abuse its discretion when it\n                        denied LTC’s request for continuance\n        {¶ 13} With respect to its contention that the BTA ought to have granted\nits request for a continuance of the April 5, 2010 hearing, the case law establishes\nand LTC agrees that the standard for our review is abuse of discretion. Coats v.\nLimbach, 47 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 548 N.E.2d 917 (1989), quoting Akron v. Pub.\nUtil. Comm., 5 Ohio St.2d 237, 241, 215 N.E.2d 366 (1966). As a result, we will\nnot reverse the BTA’s determination without a showing that the board’s “attitude\nis unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.” See J.M. Smucker, L.L.C. v. Levin,\n113 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-2073, 865 N.E.2d 866, ¶ 16. Did the BTA abuse\nits discretion in this instance?\n        {¶ 14} We acknowledge at the outset the established principle that “courts\nliberally continue cases because denying a continuance would deny a litigant his\nday in court.” Coats at 116, citing State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe, 140 Ohio St.\n535, 538, 45 N.E.2d 763 (1942).           Nonetheless, we hold that under the\ncircumstances presented, the BTA was well justified in denying a continuance,\neven if the BTA indulges (as LTC suggests) in a common practice of granting a\nfirst continuance. In so holding, we focus on the requirement that an application\nfor continuance be “made in good faith,” one of the enumerated criteria for\nevaluating such motions. Id.\n        {¶ 15} The BTA’s denial is justified because LTC’s request for\ncontinuance arises in the context of its violation of the BTA’s procedural rules in\nthree pertinent respects. First, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11, which\nauthorizes discovery, by willfully ignoring discovery requests that it disclose its\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nwitnesses and exhibits. Second, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(I) by\nfailing to make disclosure of its witnesses and exhibits 14 days or more before the\nscheduled hearing. Third, LTC failed to comply with the requirement of Ohio\nAdm.Code 5717-1-15(C) that a request for continuance be filed 14 days or more\nbefore the scheduled hearing.\n       {¶ 16} In addition, LTC’s request for continuance states no cause other\nthan the vague “unavailability” of the named appraiser. Nor does it advance any\nreason why LTC should be excused from the operation of the rules it transgressed.\nFinally, it is not wholly irrelevant that the better part of two years had already\nelapsed since the filing of the appeal. Under all these circumstances, the BTA\ncould reasonably have concluded within the exercise of its discretion that the\nrequest lacked good faith.\n       {¶ 17} This situation contrasts starkly with the facts in Coats, 47 Ohio\nSt.3d 114, 548 N.E.2d 917, and Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 53 Ohio St.3d 254, 559 N.E.2d 1351 (1990), two cases in which we did\nfind an abuse of discretion.       In Coats, the BTA declined to convene a\nsupplemental hearing for the purpose of hearing the testimony of an accountant,\nwhere the appellant had herself appeared at the first hearing and had explained\nthat the accountant was ill. In finding an abuse of discretion, we noted that (1) the\nrecord corroborated the claim of the witness’s ill health, (2) the witness’s\ntestimony was critical to the taxpayer’s case, (3) the request was made in good\nfaith, (4) the witness would likely have attended a future hearing, and (5) appellee\nhad not objected to the continuance. Id. at 117. Similarly in Strongsville, we held\nthat the Strongsville Board of Education had “proceeded with diligence when\nadvised of the unavailability of his witness” in several enumerated respects. Id. at\n256.\n       {¶ 18} Quite simply, the conduct of LTC here presents the very antithesis\nof diligence: a series of refusals to disclose its evidence that culminated in a\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nfailure to offer a good-cause explanation for the rule violations or to give any\nactual reasons for the witness’s absence. While the BTA could have decided to\ngrant the continuance, we hold that under these circumstances, the board did not\nabuse its discretion in deciding not to.\n  2. Using the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedules as a starting point\n       for valuing an assisted-living facility was not an abuse of discretion\n       {¶ 19} We turn now to the issue of the auditor’s use of cost schedules in\nvaluing LTC’s property. Here, LTC acknowledges that its facility does not neatly\nfit into any of the rule-prescribed classifications set forth in Ohio Adm.Code\n5703-25-10, so that some degree of improvisation on the auditor’s part is\nnecessary.    But LTC asserts that the auditor’s discretion in this regard is\nconstrained by the principle that “the valuation of the realty portion of congregate\ncare facilities in comparison to conventional apartment buildings has been the\nstandard since Chippewa Place [Dev. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, BTA\nNo. 91-P-245, 1993 WL 384198 (Sept. 24, 1993)].” Karrington of Kenwood, Ltd.\nv. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, BTA No. 2006-M-2329, 2009 WL 4015361, *4\n(Nov. 10, 2009). Under LTC’s theory, this passage means that assisted-living\nfacilities must be treated as apartment buildings for purposes of determining\nwhich cost schedule to use. We disagree for two reasons.\n       {¶ 20} First, the principle that LTC cites and relies on would appear to\nhave little or no application to the cost approach.       Karrington of Kenwood\ndemonstrates the point. In that case, “the board accord[ed] the cost approach very\nlittle weight.” Id., *5, fn. 1. More significant were the income and comparable-\nsale approaches, and the issue was whether to compare the subject property with\nother congregate-care facilities or with apartment buildings. The proper choice\nwas apartment buildings, because under the comparable-sale approach, the\ncomparison to other congregate-care facilities “did not accurately capture the\nvalue of the subject property” on account of “the sales [being] too remote in time\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nand distance.” The same was true under the income approach, because “the\nincome earned by an individual comparable” was found to be “too closely tied to\nthe operating business of eldercare to be indicative of the value of the real\nproperty.” Id., *3. See also Dublin Senior Community L.P. v. Franklin Cty. Bd.\nof Revision, 80 Ohio St.3d 455, 460, 687 N.E.2d 426 (1997) (because a\ncongregate-care center “comprises a combination of real estate and business\nactivities,” charging as it does both rental for the apartments and fees for ancillary\nservices, “the two activities must be kept separate” when the real estate is being\nvalued).     These considerations led the board to conclude that “the use of\ncongregate care facilities to compare either sale prices or income earned” would\ncontravene the requirement “to base value for ad valorem tax purposes on value in\nexchange and not value in use.” Karrington, *3.\n        {¶ 21} We do not think that these concerns directly apply in the cost-\nvaluation context. When sale prices are compared, the sale price of a congregate-\ncare facility may include elements of business value that relate to the provision of\nancillary services as opposed to the rental of realty; likewise, when income is\ncapitalized to determine value, the income of a congregate-care facility must be\nanalyzed into its rental and service-fee components in order to determine that\nportion of income that relates to realty. Both these considerations militate toward\nusing apartment buildings as a point of comparison when valuing the real property\nof a congregate-care facility under the sales-comparison or income-capitalization\napproaches.\n        {¶ 22} By contrast, the application of cost schedules to a particular facility\ninherently relates to the realty:    the items being “costed” are elements of a\npermanent improvement to the land that qualifies as part of the real-property tax\nbase.      See R.C. 5701.02 (defining real property to include “all buildings,\nstructures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land, and all rights\nand privileges belonging or appertaining thereto”). Under this definition, Ohio\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ntax law regards as real property “any property attached to land” unless the statutes\notherwise establish the item to constitute personal property. Thomas Steel Strip\nCorp. v. Limbach, 61 Ohio St.3d 340, 341, 575 N.E.2d 114 (1991); compare\nFuntime, Inc. v. Wilkins, 105 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-6890, 822 N.E.2d 781,\n¶ 14-16. Moreover, the distinction between the cost schedules for the nursing-\nhome/private-hospital category and that for “apartments—20 to 39 rental units” in\nno way relates to a distinction between real property value and business value, but\nto the costs of different kinds of structures adapted for particular purposes. As a\nresult, the decision of which cost category to employ does not appear to correlate\nwith the issue of segregating business value from real property value, and LTC\nhas cited no authority indicating that it does.\n       {¶ 23} Our second area of disagreement with LTC’s argument relates to\nthe potential dissimilarities between assisted-living facilities and ordinary\napartments on the one hand, together with similarities between assisted-living\nfacilities and nursing homes from the design standpoint.          Unlike ordinary\napartments, assisted-living units typically lack full kitchens in the apartments and\ninstead have congregate dining areas, and the bathrooms and hallways have\nhandrails for support and are extra wide to permit the passage of wheelchairs. See\nKarrington, BTA No. 2006-M-2329, 2009 WL 4015361, *2. These features,\nwhich add expense and are likely to be encountered in nursing homes and private\nhospitals as well, indicate the relevance of nursing-home/private-hospital costs in\nvaluing assisted-living facilities.    Accord Harbor Court Ltd. Partnership v.\nCuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, BTA No. 92-T-1054, 1994 WL 269639 (June 10,\n1994), *10 (an appraisal’s cost approach correctly used the cost manual’s “homes\nfor the elderly” category as opposed to the “conventional apartment buildings”\ncategory, given the similarity of structural characteristics).\n       {¶ 24} The similarity of the amenities incorporated into an assisted-living\nfacility to those incorporated into a nursing home or private hospital makes it\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nappropriate, under the cost approach, to include the cost elements that relate to\nthose amenities in the valuation of the property. That is so because the cost\napproach is driven by the “principle of substitution, which states that a rational,\ninformed purchaser will pay no more for a property than the cost of acquiring an\nacceptable substitute with like utility.” International Association of Assessing\nOfficers, Property Assessment Valuation 127 (2d Ed.1996). Indeed, given that\nthe goal of the cost valuation is to establish the high-end cap for what a buyer\nwould be willing to pay for a facility with the same utility, it makes sense that the\ncounty auditor in this case would have used nursing-home costs as a starting point\nand adjusted downward to determine the value of LTC’s facility. See Dayton-\nMontgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, 113 Ohio St.3d\n281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, ¶ 12 (“By determining the cost to replace\nexisting improvements, the auditor establishes an upper limit to the amount a\nbuyer would be willing to pay for an existing structure”), citing Dinner Bell\nMeats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, 12 Ohio St.3d 270, 272, 466 N.E.2d\n909 (1984); Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, 75 Ohio St.3d 181,\n187, 661 N.E.2d 1056 (1996).\n       {¶ 25} Finally, we note that LTC characterizes the county’s 25 percent\nreduction for obsolescence (plus the additional downward adjustment) as a “fudge\nfactor” that does not justify using the nursing-home/private-hospital cost\nschedule. It is true that the basis for these reductions has not been explained by\nthe county, but under the case law, the county does not bear the burden of offering\nsuch an explanation.     See Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, ¶ 30 (“we\nreiterate that the county does not have the affirmative burden to establish as a\ngeneral matter the accuracy of any appraisals that underlie its valuation of the\nproperty” [emphasis sic]). In this regard, LTC’s citation of Dayton-Montgomery\nCty. Port Auth., 113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22 (“Port\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nAuth.”) is unavailing. As we explained in Colonial Village, Port Auth. presented\nan exception to the usual rule because “the developed record before the BTA\nnegated the validity of the county’s valuation of the property.” Colonial Village,\n¶ 24. Specifically, the taxpayer in Port Auth. had presented actual-cost evidence\nthat negated the application of a 1.6 grade-factor adjustment to the cost figure\nfrom the schedules. Port Auth., ¶ 7, 14, 16. By contrast, LTC’s evidence does\nnot rise to the level of placing the burden on the county to explain its\ncomputation.\n                                     Conclusion\n       {¶ 26} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the BTA’s decision to\naffirm the county’s use of the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedule as a\nstarting point in performing a cost valuation of LTC’s assisted-living facility was\nneither unreasonable nor unlawful and that the BTA did not abuse its discretion\nby denying a continuance. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.\n                                                                Decision affirmed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                               __________________\n       PFEIFER, J., concurring.\n       {¶ 27} I concur in whole with the majority opinion. I write separately as a\ncautionary tale for practitioners.\n       {¶ 28} All property owners and their counsel know that they have a heavy\nburden to overcome when challenging a valuation. So why, as in this case, make\nthe situation worse by ignoring simple and obvious requirements? Continuances\nare routinely granted in tax cases, but not when the party seeking the continuance\ndisregards well-established procedure, such as requesting the continuance in a\ntimely fashion and disclosing its witnesses and exhibits. And if a corporate entity\nwants to challenge a valuation, it should send a certified appraiser or other\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nqualified expert, not an employee, however experienced. It is well known that the\nonly nonexperts competent to testify as to valuation are owners. Finally, the best\nway to challenge a valuation is with a proper appraisal, which was not submitted\nin this case. Little wonder that the property owner was unable to establish that the\nboard of revision abused its discretion.\n       {¶ 29} I am sympathetic to the property owner in this case. The valuation\nmethod used by the auditor to determine the value of a congregate-care assisted-\nliving facility is questionable. It seems more reasonable to base the cost on that of\nan apartment complex than on a nursing home or hospital. But for a variety of\nreasons, the corporate property owner was not able to adequately prove its case.\n                              __________________\n       Wayne E.

On the merits, LTC contends that the auditor overvalued its\nproperty by predicating his cost-based valuation on the cost schedule for nursing\nhomes and private hospitals rather than on the cost schedule for apartment\nbuildings with 20 to 39 rental units. LTC hypothesizes that had the auditor used\nthe cost schedule for apartments as a starting point, his ultimate conclusion of\nvalue would have been lower. In addition, LTC alleges a procedural error in the\nBTA’s denial of LTC’s request for a continuance of the evidentiary hearing.\n        {¶ 2} Because we disagree with both of LTC’s arguments, we affirm the\ndecision of the BTA.\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                          Facts\n       {¶ 3} For tax year 2007, the Licking County auditor, an appellee,\nassigned a true value of $1,975,000 to Chestnut House Assisted Living, which\nconsists of 2.43 acres, improved with a 25,824 square-foot building and a paved\nparking area.    The auditor’s land value was $307,400, and the value of\nimprovements was $1,667,600.        The property record card indicates that the\nauditor used the “nursing home” cost schedule, which attributed a cost-based\nvalue of $92.50 per square foot for the building. The county also applied a grade-\nfactor adjustment of 110 percent, to derive a “replacement-cost-new” figure of\n$2,627,590. Next, the county applied a 25 percent reduction for obsolescence,\nwhich led to a cost-less-depreciation figure of $1,970,694 for the building.\n       {¶ 4} But obsolescence was merely one adjustment. The actual amount\nof cost value assigned to the building was $1,653,130 (i.e., $1,667,600 minus the\ncost of the paved area, which was $14,470). That number reflects a substantial\nreduction from the $1,970,694 figure previously determined to be the cost-less-\ndepreciation associated with the facility.        Thus, the auditor’s obsolescence\nadjustment, together with additional adjustments, lowered the original square-\nfootage computation by 37 percent—from $2,627,590 to $1,653,130. Indeed, the\nvaluation of the building represents almost a 31 percent reduction from the figure\nderived by multiplying the nursing-home cost figure of $92.50 per square foot by\nthe 25,824 square feet of the building.\n       {¶ 5} Appellant, LTC Properties, Inc., filed a valuation complaint on\nMarch 24, 2008, with the BOR, seeking a reduced value of $1,000,000. The\nNewark City Schools Board of Education (“school board”) filed a\ncountercomplaint on April 28, and the BOR held a hearing on May 20, 2008.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f                                     January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 6} At the hearing, LTC presented the testimony1 of William\nMcVeigh, the property tax manager for Assisted Living Concepts, the parent of\nLTC. McVeigh asserted that Chestnut House is an assisted-living facility with 39\nefficiency-apartments, 38 of which were then occupied. McVeigh offered an\nincome-capitalization analysis that estimated the facility’s value at $54 per square\nfoot, for a true value of approximately $1,380,000 for the facility as a whole. The\nauditor’s valuation of $1,975,000, by contrast, reflects a valuation of some $76\nper square foot. On cross-examination, McVeigh explained that the rent number\nwas generated by market-driven surveys “for this specific purpose.” McVeigh\nalso distinguished the $1,200 to $1,800 per month that residents actually pay as\n“service fees,” only a portion of which can properly be characterized as rent that\nrelates to the value of the realty. Additionally, McVeigh contested the propriety\nof the auditor’s using the nursing-home and private-hospital category for cost-\nvaluation purposes.        On cross-examination, McVeigh conceded that he was\nneither an employee nor an owner of the taxpayer and that he was not a certified\nappraiser.\n        {¶ 7} By order dated July 3, 2008, the BOR retained the auditor’s\nvaluation of the property, and LTC appealed to the BTA on July 10, 2008. On\nNovember 14, 2008, the school board filed a motion to compel discovery of\nLTC’s witnesses and exhibits, which recited that the school board had served\ninterrogatories and document requests on LTC on September 12 and had followed\nup with LTC twice. On December 9, 2008, the BTA denied the motion to compel\non the grounds that it had been filed more than 120 days after the filing of the\nappeal, which is outside the time limit for seeking the board’s involvement in\n\n\n1. The BOR hearing was transcribed by a court reporter, and the transcript does not show that\nMcVeigh was sworn. Nor does the transcript show any objection to his giving unsworn testimony.\nWe will regard the absence of an objection to the testimony on account of the witness’s not having\nbeen sworn as a waiver of the point.

But the BTA order also\nadmonished LTC that ignoring the discovery request could lead to exclusion of its\nevidence.\n       {¶ 8} The BTA set the case for hearing on April 5, 2010. The county\nand the school board filed disclosures of witnesses and/or exhibits on March 19\nand 22, 2010, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(I), which requires such\ndisclosure at least 14 days before the scheduled hearing. LTC made no such\ndisclosures. Then, on March 26, 2010, 10 days before the scheduled hearing,\nLTC sent a letter requesting continuance of the hearing. The letter tersely stated,\n“Our appraiser is Richard Racek” and that he was “unavailable on [April 5],”\nwithout offering any reason for the appraiser’s unavailability or for the failure to\ndisclose the appraiser and his report previously. On March 29, the county filed a\nmemorandum opposing the continuance, to which LTC responded on March 30.\n       {¶ 9} By order dated March 30, 2010, the BTA denied the continuance.\nThe BTA noted that LTC had ignored discovery and that the school board’s\nwitness disclosure had objected to any witnesses or exhibits for LTC because of\nLTC’s disregard of the discovery requests seeking that very information. The\nBTA next noted that LTC was in violation of both the 14-day disclosure rule and\ndivision (C) of Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15, which requires a continuance request\nto be filed no later than 14 days before the scheduled hearing. Based on the\nmultiple rule violations and the failure to state good cause, the BTA denied the\ncontinuance. With respect to the request that LTC witnesses and exhibits be\nexcluded, the BTA deferred judgment.\n       {¶ 10} The three parties—LTC, the county, and the school board—\nappeared through counsel at the April 5 hearing. Counsel for LTC read aloud\nportions of McVeigh’s testimony to the BOR and presented two exhibits, one\nshowing cost per square foot used by the county for apartments, the other showing\nproperty record cards of other assisted-living facilities. The BTA received the\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nexhibits over objection of the county and the school board. The BTA then\nentertained briefs from the parties.\n       {¶ 11} On June 7, 2011, the BTA issued its decision. As for McVeigh’s\npresentation to the BOR, the BTA declined to adopt his conclusions because\n“there is no data included to support the conclusions reached.” LTC Properties,\nInc. v. Licking Cty.

With respect to LTC’s contention that the auditor should have\nused the apartment cost schedules as the starting point, the BTA held that\nalthough it had in the past “adopted, at least in part, many appraisals of assisted\nliving facilities that have relied upon comparisons of the subject facilities to\napartment complexes, there is no requirement that such comparisons be made.”\nId., *4. Acknowledging that “the particular code that a county assigns to a\nproperty may impact its valuation, it is clearly not the only factor that determines\nthe valuation to be assigned,” and as a result, “any appraisal of an assisted living\nfacility that is based on rates attributable to an alternative code may require\nadjustments, which it appears were made by the county herein.” Id., *5. The\nBTA found that LTC had “failed to demonstrate that the value which it seeks has\na basis in the market, as of the tax lien date in question” and that the taxpayer had\nthereby not satisfied its burden of proof. Id. Accordingly, the BTA retained the\ncounty’s valuation. Id. We now affirm.\n                                       Analysis\n       {¶ 12} Because the true value of property is a “question of fact, the\ndetermination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities,”\nwe have held that we will “not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals\nwith respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that\nsuch decision is unreasonable or unlawful.” Cuyahoga Cty.

Did the BTA abuse\nits discretion in this instance?\n        {¶ 14} We acknowledge at the outset the established principle that “courts\nliberally continue cases because denying a continuance would deny a litigant his\nday in court.” Coats at 116, citing State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3780650\"><a href=\"/opinion/4024303/state-ex-rel-v-mccabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3780650\"><a href=\"/opinion/4024303/state-ex-rel-v-mccabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1942).           Nonetheless, we hold that under the\ncircumstances presented, the BTA was well justified in denying a continuance,\neven if the BTA indulges (as LTC suggests) in a common practice of granting a\nfirst continuance. In so holding, we focus on the requirement that an application\nfor continuance be “made in good faith,” one of the enumerated criteria for\nevaluating such motions. Id.\n        {¶ 15} The BTA’s denial is justified because LTC’s request for\ncontinuance arises in the context of its violation of the BTA’s procedural rules in\nthree pertinent respects. First, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11, which\nauthorizes discovery, by willfully ignoring discovery requests that it disclose its\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nwitnesses and exhibits. Second, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(I) by\nfailing to make disclosure of its witnesses and exhibits 14 days or more before the\nscheduled hearing. Third, LTC failed to comply with the requirement of Ohio\nAdm.Code 5717-1-15(C) that a request for continuance be filed 14 days or more\nbefore the scheduled hearing.\n       {¶ 16} In addition, LTC’s request for continuance states no cause other\nthan the vague “unavailability” of the named appraiser. Nor does it advance any\nreason why LTC should be excused from the operation of the rules it transgressed.\nFinally, it is not wholly irrelevant that the better part of two years had already\nelapsed since the filing of the appeal. Under all these circumstances, the BTA\ncould reasonably have concluded within the exercise of its discretion that the\nrequest lacked good faith.\n       {¶ 17} This situation contrasts starkly with the facts in Coats, 47 Ohio\nSt.3d 114, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v.

In Coats, the BTA declined to convene a\nsupplemental hearing for the purpose of hearing the testimony of an accountant,\nwhere the appellant had herself appeared at the first hearing and had explained\nthat the accountant was ill. In finding an abuse of discretion, we noted that (1) the\nrecord corroborated the claim of the witness’s ill health, (2) the witness’s\ntestimony was critical to the taxpayer’s case, (3) the request was made in good\nfaith, (4) the witness would likely have attended a future hearing, and (5) appellee\nhad not objected to the continuance. Id. at 117. Similarly in Strongsville, we held\nthat the Strongsville Board of Education had “proceeded with diligence when\nadvised of the unavailability of his witness” in several enumerated respects. Id. at\n256.\n       {¶ 18} Quite simply, the conduct of LTC here presents the very antithesis\nof diligence: a series of refusals to disclose its evidence that culminated in a\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nfailure to offer a good-cause explanation for the rule violations or to give any\nactual reasons for the witness’s absence. While the BTA could have decided to\ngrant the continuance, we hold that under these circumstances, the board did not\nabuse its discretion in deciding not to.\n  2. Using the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedules as a starting point\n       for valuing an assisted-living facility was not an abuse of discretion\n       {¶ 19} We turn now to the issue of the auditor’s use of cost schedules in\nvaluing LTC’s property. Here, LTC acknowledges that its facility does not neatly\nfit into any of the rule-prescribed classifications set forth in Ohio Adm.Code\n5703-25-10, so that some degree of improvisation on the auditor’s part is\nnecessary.    But LTC asserts that the auditor’s discretion in this regard is\nconstrained by the principle that “the valuation of the realty portion of congregate\ncare facilities in comparison to conventional apartment buildings has been the\nstandard since Chippewa Place [Dev. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, BTA\nNo. 91-P-245, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">384198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Sept. 24, 1993)].” Karrington of Kenwood, Ltd.\nv.

Under LTC’s theory, this passage means that assisted-living\nfacilities must be treated as apartment buildings for purposes of determining\nwhich cost schedule to use. We disagree for two reasons.\n       {¶ 20} First, the principle that LTC cites and relies on would appear to\nhave little or no application to the cost approach.       Karrington of Kenwood\ndemonstrates the point. In that case, “the board accord[ed] the cost approach very\nlittle weight.” Id., *5, fn. 1. More significant were the income and comparable-\nsale approaches, and the issue was whether to compare the subject property with\nother congregate-care facilities or with apartment buildings. The proper choice\nwas apartment buildings, because under the comparable-sale approach, the\ncomparison to other congregate-care facilities “did not accurately capture the\nvalue of the subject property” on account of “the sales [being] too remote in time\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nand distance.” The same was true under the income approach, because “the\nincome earned by an individual comparable” was found to be “too closely tied to\nthe operating business of eldercare to be indicative of the value of the real\nproperty.” Id., *3. See also Dublin Senior Community L.P. v. Franklin Cty. Bd.\nof Revision, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997) (because a\ncongregate-care center “comprises a combination of real estate and business\nactivities,” charging as it does both rental for the apartments and fees for ancillary\nservices, “the two activities must be kept separate” when the real estate is being\nvalued).     These considerations led the board to conclude that “the use of\ncongregate care facilities to compare either sale prices or income earned” would\ncontravene the requirement “to base value for ad valorem tax purposes on value in\nexchange and not value in use.” Karrington, *3.\n        {¶ 21} We do not think that these concerns directly apply in the cost-\nvaluation context. When sale prices are compared, the sale price of a congregate-\ncare facility may include elements of business value that relate to the provision of\nancillary services as opposed to the rental of realty; likewise, when income is\ncapitalized to determine value, the income of a congregate-care facility must be\nanalyzed into its rental and service-fee components in order to determine that\nportion of income that relates to realty. Both these considerations militate toward\nusing apartment buildings as a point of comparison when valuing the real property\nof a congregate-care facility under the sales-comparison or income-capitalization\napproaches.\n        {¶ 22} By contrast, the application of cost schedules to a particular facility\ninherently relates to the realty:    the items being “costed” are elements of a\npermanent improvement to the land that qualifies as part of the real-property tax\nbase.      See R.C. 5701.02 (defining real property to include “all buildings,\nstructures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land, and all rights\nand privileges belonging or appertaining thereto”). Under this definition, Ohio\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ntax law regards as real property “any property attached to land” unless the statutes\notherwise establish the item to constitute personal property.

Moreover, the distinction between the cost schedules for the nursing-\nhome/private-hospital category and that for “apartments—20 to 39 rental units” in\nno way relates to a distinction between real property value and business value, but\nto the costs of different kinds of structures adapted for particular purposes. As a\nresult, the decision of which cost category to employ does not appear to correlate\nwith the issue of segregating business value from real property value, and LTC\nhas cited no authority indicating that it does.\n       {¶ 23} Our second area of disagreement with LTC’s argument relates to\nthe potential dissimilarities between assisted-living facilities and ordinary\napartments on the one hand, together with similarities between assisted-living\nfacilities and nursing homes from the design standpoint.          Unlike ordinary\napartments, assisted-living units typically lack full kitchens in the apartments and\ninstead have congregate dining areas, and the bathrooms and hallways have\nhandrails for support and are extra wide to permit the passage of wheelchairs. See\nKarrington, BTA No. 2006-M-2329, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4015361</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2. These features,\nwhich add expense and are likely to be encountered in nursing homes and private\nhospitals as well, indicate the relevance of nursing-home/private-hospital costs in\nvaluing assisted-living facilities.

Bd. of Revision, BTA No. 92-T-1054, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">269639</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (June 10,\n1994), *10 (an appraisal’s cost approach correctly used the cost manual’s “homes\nfor the elderly” category as opposed to the “conventional apartment buildings”\ncategory, given the similarity of structural characteristics).\n       {¶ 24} The similarity of the amenities incorporated into an assisted-living\nfacility to those incorporated into a nursing home or private hospital makes it\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nappropriate, under the cost approach, to include the cost elements that relate to\nthose amenities in the valuation of the property. That is so because the cost\napproach is driven by the “principle of substitution, which states that a rational,\ninformed purchaser will pay no more for a property than the cost of acquiring an\nacceptable substitute with like utility.” International Association of Assessing\nOfficers, Property Assessment Valuation 127 (2d Ed.1996). Indeed, given that\nthe goal of the cost valuation is to establish the high-end cap for what a buyer\nwould be willing to pay for a facility with the same utility, it makes sense that the\ncounty auditor in this case would have used nursing-home costs as a starting point\nand adjusted downward to determine the value of LTC’s facility.

It is true that the basis for these reductions has not been explained by\nthe county, but under the case law, the county does not bear the burden of offering\nsuch an explanation.     See Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2009-Ohio-4975, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 30 (“we\nreiterate that the county does not have the affirmative burden to establish as a\ngeneral matter the accuracy of any appraisals that underlie its valuation of the\nproperty” [emphasis sic]).

As we explained in Colonial Village, Port Auth. presented\nan exception to the usual rule because “the developed record before the BTA\nnegated the validity of the county’s valuation of the property.” Colonial Village,\n¶ 24. Specifically, the taxpayer in Port Auth. had presented actual-cost evidence\nthat negated the application of a 1.6 grade-factor adjustment to the cost figure\nfrom the schedules. Port Auth., ¶ 7, 14, 16. By contrast, LTC’s evidence does\nnot rise to the level of placing the burden on the county to explain its\ncomputation.\n                                     Conclusion\n       {¶ 26} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the BTA’s decision to\naffirm the county’s use of the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedule as a\nstarting point in performing a cost valuation of LTC’s assisted-living facility was\nneither unreasonable nor unlawful and that the BTA did not abuse its discretion\nby denying a continuance. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.\n                                                                Decision affirmed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                               __________________\n       PFEIFER, J., concurring.\n       {¶ 27} I concur in whole with the majority opinion. I write separately as a\ncautionary tale for practitioners.\n       {¶ 28} All property owners and their counsel know that they have a heavy\nburden to overcome when challenging a valuation. So why, as in this case, make\nthe situation worse by ignoring simple and obvious requirements? Continuances\nare routinely granted in tax cases, but not when the party seeking the continuance\ndisregards well-established procedure, such as requesting the continuance in a\ntimely fashion and disclosing its witnesses and exhibits. And if a corporate entity\nwants to challenge a valuation, it should send a certified appraiser or other\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nqualified expert, not an employee, however experienced. It is well known that the\nonly nonexperts competent to testify as to valuation are owners. Finally, the best\nway to challenge a valuation is with a proper appraisal, which was not submitted\nin this case. Little wonder that the property owner was unable to establish that the\nboard of revision abused its discretion.\n       {¶ 29} I am sympathetic to the property owner in this case. The valuation\nmethod used by the auditor to determine the value of a congregate-care assisted-\nliving facility is questionable. It seems more reasonable to base the cost on that of\nan apartment complex than on a nursing home or hospital. But for a variety of\nreasons, the corporate property owner was not able to adequately prove its case.\n                              __________________\n       Wayne E.
