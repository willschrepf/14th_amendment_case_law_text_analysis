Conlon, Judge.\n                          ____________\nARGUED SEPTEMBER 13, 2001—DECIDED FEBRUARY 13, 2003\n                   ____________\n\n\n Before RIPPLE, ROVNER, and EVANS, Circuit Judges.\n  ROVNER, Circuit Judge. Illinois prisoner Tyrone Calhoun\nsued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging in relevant part that\nprison employees at the Stateville Correctional Center\nconducted a deliberately harassing strip search in front\nof female guards that constituted cruel and unusual pun-\nishment under the Eighth Amendment. Relying on 28\nU.S.C. § 1915A, the district court sua sponte dismissed\nCalhoun’s complaint prior to service for failure to state\na claim upon which relief may be granted. Calhoun ap-\npeals, and we vacate the dismissal of his Eighth Amend-\nment claims and remand for further proceedings.\n  According to his amended complaint, prison guards\nremoved Calhoun from his cell and escorted him from the\n\f2                                               No. 98-2894\n\nprison’s segregation unit to an open telephone area of the\nday room to conduct a strip search. When they reached the\nday room, Calhoun pleaded for the guards to take him to a\nmore private area, but the guards ordered him to strip\ndirectly in front of several female guards who had no offi-\ncial role in conducting the search. Calhoun contends that\nhe was forced to remove his clothing even after informing\nthe guards that such a search, absent emergency circum-\nstances, would violate the federal constitution, state law,\nand prison regulations. Further, he alleges that during\nthe search the male and female officers laughed at him,\nmade “sexual ribald comments,” forced him to perform\n“provocative acts,” and “pointed their sticks towards his\nanal area” while he bent over and spread his buttocks to\npermit visual inspection for contraband. Moreover, Calhoun\ncontends, then-warden George DeTella and an assistant\nwarden observed the search but took no corrective action.\nFinally, Calhoun alleges that the search constituted “sex-\nual harassment,” and that after his “traumatic experience”\nhe sought psychological treatment, but did not receive\nthe help he needed. He requested compensatory and\npunitive damages and injunctive and declaratory relief,\nas well as “such other relief as it may appear plaintiff\nis entitled.”\n  In screening and dismissing the amended complaint\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the district court reasoned that\nCalhoun’s suit was precluded by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)\nbecause he alleges only psychological, and not physical\ninjury. Calhoun timely moved to alter or amend the judg-\nment, pointing out that § 1997e(e) does not foreclose\ninjunctive and declaratory relief. See Zehner v. Trigg, 133\nF.3d 459, 462-63 (7th Cir. 1997); Davis v. Dist. of Columbia,\n158 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998). The district court\ndenied the motion, concluding that the amended com-\nplaint did not allege grounds for either injunctive or de-\nclaratory relief. Calhoun appealed, and we appointed\ncounsel to represent him.\n\fNo. 98-2894                                               3\n\n  In his amended complaint Calhoun asserts that the\nstrip search violated Illinois law and various constitu-\ntional guarantees, but on appeal he pursues only the\nEighth Amendment claim and has thus abandoned the\nothers. See Duncan v. Wis. Dep’t of Health & Family Servs.,\n166 F.3d 930, 934 (7th Cir. 1999). He argues that the\nallegations in his amended complaint state a viable Eighth\nAmendment claim, and that even absent physical injury\n§ 1997e(e) does not preclude him from recovering nominal\nand punitive damages for the constitutional violation. He\nconcedes, however, that § 1997e(e) bars his recovery of\ncompensatory damages for mental and emotional harm,\nand that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief\nare now moot because he was transferred from Stateville\nto the Pontiac Correctional Facility during the pendency\nof this appeal. See Higgason v. Farley, 83 F.3d 807, 811\n(7th Cir. 1996).\n  We review dismissals under § 1915A for failure to state\na claim de novo, viewing all allegations in the complaint\nas true and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\nZimmerman v. Tribble, 226 F.3d 568, 571 (7th Cir. 2000).\nWith this standard in mind, we must first determine\nwhether Calhoun’s allegations, that prison guards purpose-\nfully demeaned and sexually harassed him while strip\nsearching him in front of female officers, are sufficient\nto state a claim of cruel and unusual punishment under\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n  There is no question that strip searches may be unpleas-\nant, humiliating, and embarrassing to prisoners, but not\nevery psychological discomfort a prisoner endures amounts\nto a constitutional violation. For example, the strip search\nof a male prisoner in front of female officers, if conducted\nfor a legitimate penological purpose, would fail to rise to\nthe level of an Eighth Amendment violation. See Johnson\nv. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 150-51 (7th Cir. 1995). Instead, the\nEighth Amendment prohibits unnecessary and wanton\n\f4                                               No. 98-2894\n\ninfliction of pain, thus forbidding punishment that is “so\ntotally without penological justification that it results in\nthe gratuitous infliction of suffering.” Gregg v. Georgia,\n428 U.S. 153, 173, 183 (1976). Such gratuitous infliction of\npain always violates contemporary standards of decency\nand need not produce serious injury in order to violate\nthe Eighth Amendment. See Hudson v. McMillan, 503 U.S.\n1, 9 (1992). Moreover, physical injury need not result for\nthe punishment to state a cause of action, for the wan-\nton infliction of psychological pain is also prohibited. See\nid. at 16 (Blackmun, J., concurring); Delaney v. DeTella,\n256 F.3d 679, 685 (7th Cir. 2001); Babcock v. White, 102\nF.3d 267, 273 (7th Cir. 1996). Accordingly, to state an\nEighth Amendment claim Calhoun must show that the\nstrip search in question was not merely a legitimate search\nconducted in the presence of female correctional officers,\nbut instead a search conducted in a harassing manner\nintended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain. See\nPeckham v. Wis. Dep’t of Corr., 141 F.3d 694, 697 (7th Cir.\n1998); Johnson, 69 F.3d at 147.\n  The Attorney General of Illinois, who appears as amicus\ncuriae in support of the defendants, urges us to conclude\nthat Calhoun failed to state a claim because, although\nhe objected to the manner in which the guards conducted\nthe search, he never explicitly alleged that the guards\nsearched him for an illegitimate purpose. But the Federal\nRules provide a liberal system of notice pleading, see Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 8, and Calhoun’s complaint includes enough\nto give the defendants fair notice of his Eighth Amend-\nment claim and the grounds upon which his claim rests.\nSee Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence\n& Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993); Payton v.\nKane County, 308 F.3d 673, 676 (7th Cir. 2002). Calhoun\nalleges that the officers sexually harassed him through\nbehavior unrelated to legitimate prison needs. In particular,\nhe alleges that the guards made “ribald comments” and\n\fNo. 98-2894                                                 5\n\nsexually explicit gestures during the search, and that\nthey forced him to perform sexually provocative acts. Fur-\nthermore, he alleges that the female guards present dur-\ning the search were neither mere passersby nor perform-\ning the legitimate penological function of conducting or\nmonitoring the search; they were instead invited specta-\ntors. These allegations, if true, can only lead to the conclu-\nsion that the prison guards conducted the strip search in\na manner designed to demean and humiliate Calhoun,\nand we therefore conclude that he sufficiently states a\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment. See Johnson, 69\nF.3d at 147.\n  Because Calhoun does not claim to have suffered a\nphysical injury, we must next consider whether § 1997e(e)\nprecludes his suit altogether by barring him from seek-\ning recovery of nominal and punitive damages for the\nalleged Eighth Amendment violation. Section 1997e(e)\nprovides that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought\nby a prisoner . . . for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). The Attorney General argues that a\nplain reading of § 1997e(e) bars Calhoun’s suit entirely,\nreasoning that the statute makes a showing of physical\ninjury a filing prerequisite for every civil rights lawsuit\ninvolving mental or emotional injury. We cannot agree.\nThis contention if taken to its logical extreme would\ngive prison officials free reign to maliciously and sadisti-\ncally inflict psychological torture on prisoners, so long\nas they take care not to inflict any physical injury in the\nprocess.\n  Clearly this argument sweeps too broadly, and there is\nno longer room for the position the Attorney General\nespouses. As we have observed before and reemphasize\nhere, “[i]t would be a serious mistake to interpret section\n1997e(e) to require a showing of physical injury in all\nprisoner civil rights suits.” Robinson v. Page, 170 F.3d 747,\n\f6                                                No. 98-2894\n\n748 (7th Cir. 1999). On several occasions we have ex-\nplained that § 1997e(e) may limit the relief available to\nprisoners who cannot allege a physical injury, but it does\nnot bar their lawsuits altogether. See Cassidy v. Ind. Dep’t\nof Corr., 199 F.3d 374, 376-77 (7th Cir. 2000) (damages\nfor mental and emotional injuries barred, but prisoner\nmay pursue all other claims for damages); Zehner, 133 F.3d\nat 462 (injunctive relief available). As its title suggests,\n§ 1997e(e) is a “limitation on recovery.” Accordingly, phys-\nical injury is merely a predicate for an award of damages\nfor mental or emotional injury, not a filing prerequisite\nfor the federal civil action itself. See Robinson, 170 F.3d\nat 749.\n  We agree that, absent a showing of physical injury,\n§ 1997e(e) would bar a prisoner’s recovery of compensa-\ntory damages for mental and emotional injury. See Cas-\nsidy, 199 F.3d at 376. But if that same prisoner alleges\nsome other type of non-physical injury, the statute would\nnot foreclose recovery, assuming that the damages sought\nwere not “for” any mental or emotional injuries suffered.\nSee id.; Robinson, 170 F.3d at 749. This view is not novel.\nIndeed, in the context of First Amendment claims, we\nhave held explicitly that prisoners need not allege a physi-\ncal injury to recover damages because the deprivation of\nthe constitutional right is itself a cognizable injury, regard-\nless of any resulting mental or emotional injury. Rowe\nv. Shake, 196 F.3d 778, 781-82 (7th Cir. 1999); see also\nSearles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 879-81 (10th Cir. 2001)\n(nominal and punitive damages for First Amendment\nviolation not barred); Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 252\n(3d Cir. 2000) (same); Canell v. Lightner, 143 F.3d 1210,\n1213 (9th Cir. 1998) (any form of relief for First Amend-\nment violations available, if not for mental or emotional\ninjury). Using a similar rationale, several of our sister\ncircuits have concluded that § 1997e(e) does not bar all\nrecovery for violations of due process or the right to pri-\n\fNo. 98-2894                                                 7\n\nvacy. See Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411, 418 (2d\nCir. 2002) (nominal and punitive damages available for\ndeprivation-of-property claim); Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d\n623, 630 (9th Cir. 2002) (compensatory, nominal, or puni-\ntive damages available if premised on alleged unconsti-\ntutional conditions of pretrial confinement, and not emo-\ntional or mental distress suffered); Doe v. Delie, 257 F.3d\n309, 314 n.3 & 323 (3d Cir. 2001) (nominal and punitive\ndamages available for violation of inmates’ newly recog-\nnized right to medical privacy); but cf. Harris v. Garner,\n190 F.3d 1279, 1282, 1287-88 & n.9 (§ 1997e(e) precludes\ncompensatory and punitive damages for alleged viola-\ntions of Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, but\nexpressing no view on nominal damages), vacated & reh’g\nen banc granted, 197 F.3d 1059 (11th Cir. 1999), reinstated\nin pertinent part, 216 F.3d 970 (11th Cir. 2000); Davis, 158\nF.3d at 1348-49 (compensatory and punitive damages\nfor violations of constitutional right to privacy barred,\nbut expressing no view on nominal damages). These\ndecisions reflect an emerging view that § 1997e(e), as the\nplain language of the statute would suggest, limits recov-\nery “for mental and emotional injury,” but leaves unaf-\nfected claims for nominal and punitive damages, which\nseek to remedy a different type of injury. See Robinson, 170\nF.3d at 748.\n  We believe that the same reasoning effectively answers\nthe question posed here, namely, whether § 1997e(e)\nforecloses an action for nominal or punitive damages for\nan Eighth Amendment violation involving no physical\ninjury. Just as a “deprivation of First Amendment rights\nstanding alone is a cognizable injury,” Rowe, 196 F.3d\nat 781, so too is the violation of a person’s right to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, see Harper v. Showers,\n174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999) (claim of Eighth Amend-\nment violation “is distinct from” any claim to entitlement\nfor compensation for resulting mental or emotional dam-\n\f8                                               No. 98-2894\n\nages). Although § 1997e(e) would bar recovery of compen-\nsatory damages “for” mental and emotional injuries suf-\nfered, the statute is inapplicable to awards of nominal or\npunitive damages for the Eighth Amendment violation\nitself.\n  This conclusion readily follows from the fact that nom-\ninal damages “are not compensation for loss or injury, but\nrather recognition of a violation of rights.” Redding v.\nFairman, 717 F.2d 1105, 1119 (7th Cir. 1983); see Sahagian\nv. Dickey, 827 F.2d 90, 100 (7th Cir. 1987). The Attorney\nGeneral, relying on an isolated statement in Babcock, 102\nF.3d at 271, argues that an award of nominal damages\nfor Eighth Amendment violations would be inappropri-\nate because the constitutional guarantee against cruel\nand unusual punishment, unlike the right to procedural\ndue process, is not an “absolute” right. Cf. Carey v. Piphus,\n435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978) (because right to procedural due\nprocess is “absolute,” nominal damages are available for\ndenial of right even absent actual injury). But Babcock’s\ncomment about nominal damages was dicta because the\nappellant never argued that their availability could sal-\nvage his claim, see Babcock, 102 F.3d at 273, and because\nhe did not the panel had no occasion to explore our prior\nopinions on the subject. We long ago decided that, at a\nminimum, a plaintiff who proves a constitutional viola-\ntion is entitled to nominal damages. See Hessel v. O’Hearn,\n977 F.2d 299, 302 (7th Cir. 1992); Ustrak v. Fairman, 781\nF.2d 573, 578 (7th Cir. 1986). In particular, we have ap-\nproved the award of nominal damages for Eighth Amend-\nment violations when prisoners could not establish actual\ncompensable harm. See Madison County Jail Inmates\nv. Thompson, 773 F.2d 834, 844 (7th Cir. 1985); see also\nBriggs v. Marshall, 93 F.3d 355, 360 (7th Cir. 1996) (nomi-\nnal damages available to remedy Fourth Amendment\nexcessive force claim). Moreover, we note that several of\nour sister circuits have expressed similar approval of\n\fNo. 98-2894                                                9\n\nnominal damage awards for Eighth Amendment claims.\nSee, e.g., Gibeau v. Nellis, 18 F.3d 107, 110-11 (2d Cir.\n1994); Butler v. Dowd, 979 F.2d 661, 672 (8th Cir. 1992)\n(en banc); Beyah v. Coughlin, 789 F.2d 986, 989 (2d Cir.\n1986); Green v. McKaskle, 788 F.2d 1116, 1124 (5th Cir.\n1986); Lancaster v. Rodriguez, 701 F.2d 864, 866 (10th Cir.\n1983); Doe v. Dist. of Columbia, 697 F.2d 1115, 1122-23\n(D.C. Cir. 1983); see also Slicker v. Jackson, 215 F.3d 1225,\n1231 (11th Cir. 2000) (approving of nominal damage award\nin excessive force case). Because nominal damages are\nawarded to vindicate rights, not to compensate for result-\ning injuries, we hold that § 1997e(e) does not bar a suit\nseeking nominal damages to vindicate Eighth Amendment\nrights. See Thompson, 284 F.3d at 418 (holding that\n§ 1997e(e) does not limit availability of nominal damages\nfor Eighth Amendment violations); see also Benefield v.\nMcDowall, 241 F.3d 1267, 1272 n.3 (10th Cir. 2001) (sug-\ngesting without deciding that § 1997e(e) does not bar\nnominal damages for Eighth Amendment claims); Cassidy,\n199 F.3d at 376-77, aff’g 59 F. Supp. 2d 787 (S.D. Ind. 1999)\n(claims for damages for mental and emotional injury\nbarred, but all other claims for damages for violation of\nright to be free from disability-based discrimination avail-\nable, including nominal damages).\n  For similar reasons we believe that § 1997e(e) does not\npreclude claims for punitive damages for violations of\nthe Eighth Amendment. See Thompson, 284 F.3d at 418\n(punitive damages for Eighth Amendment violations not\nbarred); see also Benefield, 241 F.3d at 1272 n.3 (suggest-\ning without deciding that punitive damages for Eighth\nAmendment claims not barred); Oliver, 289 F.3d at 630\n(punitive damages for constitutional violation not barred);\nDoe, 257 F.3d at 314 n.3 (same); Searles, 251 F.3d at 881\n(same); Allah, 226 F.3d at 251-52 (same); but see Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286-87 (punitive damages barred); Davis, 158\nF.3d at 1348 (same). Punitive damages are awarded to\n\f10                                              No. 98-2894\n\npunish and deter reprehensible conduct. See Memphis\nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 306 n.9 (1986);\nKemezy v. Peters, 79 F.3d 33, 34 (7th Cir. 1996). And in\nSmith v. Wade, itself an Eighth Amendment case, the\nSupreme Court established that punitive damages may\nbe awarded under § 1983 upon a showing of “evil motive\nor intent, or . . . reckless or callous indifference to the\nfederally protected rights of others.” 461 U.S. 30, 56\n(1983); see Kyle v. Patterson, 196 F.3d 695, 697-98 (7th Cir.\n1999). Moreover, nothing prevents an award of punitive\ndamages for constitutional violations when compensa-\ntory damages are not available. See Erwin v. Manitowoc\nCounty, 872 F.2d 1292, 1299 (7th Cir. 1989); Sahagian, 827\nF.2d at 100. Because punitive damages are designed to\npunish and deter wrongdoers for deprivations of consti-\ntutional rights, they are not compensation “for” emotional\nand mental injury. See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306. We\ntherefore conclude that Calhoun may pursue his claims\nfor punitive damages as well.\n   Finally, the Attorney General argues that, even if nomi-\nnal and punitive damages are not barred by § 1997e(e),\nCalhoun does not expressly request nominal damages in\nhis amended complaint, and therefore that prayer for re-\nlief was never before the district court. But pleadings\nfiled by pro se litigants are to be construed liberally. See\nAlvarado v. Litscher, 267 F.3d 648, 651 (7th Cir. 2001).\nAlthough Calhoun does not specifically request nominal\ndamages—as he did compensatory and punitive damages\nand injunctive and declaratory relief—his amended com-\nplaint contains a prayer for “such other relief as it may\nappear plaintiff is entitled.” Moreover, Calhoun’s brief\non appeal makes clear that he is seeking nominal dam-\nages. Under these circumstances, Calhoun’s prayer for\n“such other relief ” can be reasonably viewed as a request\nfor nominal damages. See Kyle, 196 F.3d at 697 (liberally\nconstruing pro se prayer for $1 million in “monetary\nrelief” as a request for punitive damages).\n\fNo. 98-2894                                             11\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the dismissal of\nCalhoun’s amended complaint insofar as it alleges an\nEighth Amendment violation, and REMAND for further\nproceedings on that claim. In all other respects, the judg-\nment of the district court is AFFIRMED. In light of this\ndecision, the district court erred when it concluded that\nCalhoun had incurred one strike under 28 U.S.C § 1915(g).\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—2-13-03\n\f",

Illinois prisoner Tyrone Calhoun\nsued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging in relevant part that\nprison employees at the Stateville Correctional Center\nconducted a deliberately harassing strip search in front\nof female guards that constituted cruel and unusual pun-\nishment under the Eighth Amendment. Relying on 28\nU.S.C. § 1915A, the district court sua sponte dismissed\nCalhoun’s complaint prior to service for failure to state\na claim upon which relief may be granted. Calhoun ap-\npeals, and we vacate the dismissal of his Eighth Amend-\nment claims and remand for further proceedings.\n  According to his amended complaint, prison guards\nremoved Calhoun from his cell and escorted him from the\n\f2                                               No. 98-2894\n\nprison’s segregation unit to an open telephone area of the\nday room to conduct a strip search. When they reached the\nday room, Calhoun pleaded for the guards to take him to a\nmore private area, but the guards ordered him to strip\ndirectly in front of several female guards who had no offi-\ncial role in conducting the search. Calhoun contends that\nhe was forced to remove his clothing even after informing\nthe guards that such a search, absent emergency circum-\nstances, would violate the federal constitution, state law,\nand prison regulations. Further, he alleges that during\nthe search the male and female officers laughed at him,\nmade “sexual ribald comments,” forced him to perform\n“provocative acts,” and “pointed their sticks towards his\nanal area” while he bent over and spread his buttocks to\npermit visual inspection for contraband. Moreover, Calhoun\ncontends, then-warden George DeTella and an assistant\nwarden observed the search but took no corrective action.\nFinally, Calhoun alleges that the search constituted “sex-\nual harassment,” and that after his “traumatic experience”\nhe sought psychological treatment, but did not receive\nthe help he needed. He requested compensatory and\npunitive damages and injunctive and declaratory relief,\nas well as “such other relief as it may appear plaintiff\nis entitled.”\n  In screening and dismissing the amended complaint\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the district court reasoned that\nCalhoun’s suit was precluded by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)\nbecause he alleges only psychological, and not physical\ninjury. Calhoun timely moved to alter or amend the judg-\nment, pointing out that § 1997e(e) does not foreclose\ninjunctive and declaratory relief. See Zehner v.

He argues that the\nallegations in his amended complaint state a viable Eighth\nAmendment claim, and that even absent physical injury\n§ 1997e(e) does not preclude him from recovering nominal\nand punitive damages for the constitutional violation. He\nconcedes, however, that § 1997e(e) bars his recovery of\ncompensatory damages for mental and emotional harm,\nand that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief\nare now moot because he was transferred from Stateville\nto the Pontiac Correctional Facility during the pendency\nof this appeal.

For example, the strip search\nof a male prisoner in front of female officers, if conducted\nfor a legitimate penological purpose, would fail to rise to\nthe level of an Eighth Amendment violation. See Johnson\nv. Phelan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150-51 (7th Cir. 1995). Instead, the\nEighth Amendment prohibits unnecessary and wanton\n\f4                                               No. 98-2894\n\ninfliction of pain, thus forbidding punishment that is “so\ntotally without penological justification that it results in\nthe gratuitous infliction of suffering.” Gregg v.

Such gratuitous infliction of\npain always violates contemporary standards of decency\nand need not produce serious injury in order to violate\nthe Eighth Amendment. See Hudson v.

Moreover, physical injury need not result for\nthe punishment to state a cause of action, for the wan-\nton infliction of psychological pain is also prohibited. See\nid. at 16 (Blackmun, J., concurring); Delaney v. DeTella,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773975\"><a href=\"/opinion/773975/glen-delaney-v-george-detella-glenn-malone-christopher-hughes-eugene/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (7th Cir. 2001); Babcock v.

Accordingly, to state an\nEighth Amendment claim Calhoun must show that the\nstrip search in question was not merely a legitimate search\nconducted in the presence of female correctional officers,\nbut instead a search conducted in a harassing manner\nintended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain. See\nPeckham v. Wis. Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753022\"><a href=\"/opinion/753022/jane-peckham-v-wisconsin-department-of-corrections-patrick-j-fiedler/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (7th Cir.\n1998); Johnson, 69 F.3d at 147.\n  The Attorney General of Illinois, who appears as amicus\ncuriae in support of the defendants, urges us to conclude\nthat Calhoun failed to state a claim because, although\nhe objected to the manner in which the guards conducted\nthe search, he never explicitly alleged that the guards\nsearched him for an illegitimate purpose. But the Federal\nRules provide a liberal system of notice pleading, see Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 8, and Calhoun’s complaint includes enough\nto give the defendants fair notice of his Eighth Amend-\nment claim and the grounds upon which his claim rests.\nSee Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence\n& Coordination Unit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (1993); Payton v.\nKane County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779588\"><a href=\"/opinion/779588/delvin-c-payton-v-county-of-kane/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676 (7th Cir. 2002). Calhoun\nalleges that the officers sexually harassed him through\nbehavior unrelated to legitimate prison needs. In particular,\nhe alleges that the guards made “ribald comments” and\n\fNo. 98-2894                                                 5\n\nsexually explicit gestures during the search, and that\nthey forced him to perform sexually provocative acts. Fur-\nthermore, he alleges that the female guards present dur-\ning the search were neither mere passersby nor perform-\ning the legitimate penological function of conducting or\nmonitoring the search; they were instead invited specta-\ntors. These allegations, if true, can only lead to the conclu-\nsion that the prison guards conducted the strip search in\na manner designed to demean and humiliate Calhoun,\nand we therefore conclude that he sufficiently states a\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment. See Johnson, 69\nF.3d at 147.\n  Because Calhoun does not claim to have suffered a\nphysical injury, we must next consider whether § 1997e(e)\nprecludes his suit altogether by barring him from seek-\ning recovery of nominal and punitive damages for the\nalleged Eighth Amendment violation. Section 1997e(e)\nprovides that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought\nby a prisoner . . . for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). The Attorney General argues that a\nplain reading of § 1997e(e) bars Calhoun’s suit entirely,\nreasoning that the statute makes a showing of physical\ninjury a filing prerequisite for every civil rights lawsuit\ninvolving mental or emotional injury. We cannot agree.\nThis contention if taken to its logical extreme would\ngive prison officials free reign to maliciously and sadisti-\ncally inflict psychological torture on prisoners, so long\nas they take care not to inflict any physical injury in the\nprocess.\n  Clearly this argument sweeps too broadly, and there is\nno longer room for the position the Attorney General\nespouses. As we have observed before and reemphasize\nhere, “[i]t would be a serious mistake to interpret section\n1997e(e) to require a showing of physical injury in all\nprisoner civil rights suits.” Robinson v. Page, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762451\"><a href=\"/opinion/762451/floyd-robinson-v-thomas-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\f6                                                No. 98-2894\n\n748 (7th Cir. 1999). On several occasions we have ex-\nplained that § 1997e(e) may limit the relief available to\nprisoners who cannot allege a physical injury, but it does\nnot bar their lawsuits altogether. See Cassidy v. Ind. Dep’t\nof Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767120\"><a href=\"/opinion/767120/richard-cassidy-v-indiana-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376-77 (7th Cir. 2000) (damages\nfor mental and emotional injuries barred, but prisoner\nmay pursue all other claims for damages); Zehner, 133 F.3d\nat 462 (injunctive relief available). As its title suggests,\n§ 1997e(e) is a “limitation on recovery.” Accordingly, phys-\nical injury is merely a predicate for an award of damages\nfor mental or emotional injury, not a filing prerequisite\nfor the federal civil action itself. See Robinson, 170 F.3d\nat 749.\n  We agree that, absent a showing of physical injury,\n§ 1997e(e) would bar a prisoner’s recovery of compensa-\ntory damages for mental and emotional injury. See Cas-\nsidy, 199 F.3d at 376. But if that same prisoner alleges\nsome other type of non-physical injury, the statute would\nnot foreclose recovery, assuming that the damages sought\nwere not “for” any mental or emotional injuries suffered.\nSee id.; Robinson, 170 F.3d at 749. This view is not novel.\nIndeed, in the context of First Amendment claims, we\nhave held explicitly that prisoners need not allege a physi-\ncal injury to recover damages because the deprivation of\nthe constitutional right is itself a cognizable injury, regard-\nless of any resulting mental or emotional injury.

These\ndecisions reflect an emerging view that § 1997e(e), as the\nplain language of the statute would suggest, limits recov-\nery “for mental and emotional injury,” but leaves unaf-\nfected claims for nominal and punitive damages, which\nseek to remedy a different type of injury. See Robinson, 170\nF.3d at 748.\n  We believe that the same reasoning effectively answers\nthe question posed here, namely, whether § 1997e(e)\nforecloses an action for nominal or punitive damages for\nan Eighth Amendment violation involving no physical\ninjury. Just as a “deprivation of First Amendment rights\nstanding alone is a cognizable injury,” Rowe, 196 F.3d\nat 781, so too is the violation of a person’s right to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, see Harper v.

Although § 1997e(e) would bar recovery of compen-\nsatory damages “for” mental and emotional injuries suf-\nfered, the statute is inapplicable to awards of nominal or\npunitive damages for the Eighth Amendment violation\nitself.\n  This conclusion readily follows from the fact that nom-\ninal damages “are not compensation for loss or injury, but\nrather recognition of a violation of rights.” Redding v.\nFairman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (7th Cir. 1983); see Sahagian\nv.

The Attorney\nGeneral, relying on an isolated statement in Babcock, 102\nF.3d at 271, argues that an award of nominal damages\nfor Eighth Amendment violations would be inappropri-\nate because the constitutional guarantee against cruel\nand unusual punishment, unlike the right to procedural\ndue process, is not an “absolute” right.

And in\nSmith v.

Moreover, nothing prevents an award of punitive\ndamages for constitutional violations when compensa-\ntory damages are not available. See Erwin v. Manitowoc\nCounty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521924\"><a href=\"/opinion/521924/joseph-erwin-brenda-erwin-katrina-erwin-debra-laier-james-laier-rowena/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1299 (7th Cir. 1989); Sahagian, 827\nF.2d at 100. Because punitive damages are designed to\npunish and deter wrongdoers for deprivations of consti-\ntutional rights, they are not compensation “for” emotional\nand mental injury. See Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306. We\ntherefore conclude that Calhoun may pursue his claims\nfor punitive damages as well.\n   Finally, the Attorney General argues that, even if nomi-\nnal and punitive damages are not barred by § 1997e(e),\nCalhoun does not expressly request nominal damages in\nhis amended complaint, and therefore that prayer for re-\nlief was never before the district court. But pleadings\nfiled by pro se litigants are to be construed liberally. See\nAlvarado v. Litscher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775150\"><a href=\"/opinion/775150/chad-j-alvarado-v-jon-e-litscher-secretary-jane-gamble-b-mccreedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (7th Cir. 2001).\nAlthough Calhoun does not specifically request nominal\ndamages—as he did compensatory and punitive damages\nand injunctive and declaratory relief—his amended com-\nplaint contains a prayer for “such other relief as it may\nappear plaintiff is entitled.” Moreover, Calhoun’s brief\non appeal makes clear that he is seeking nominal dam-\nages. Under these circumstances, Calhoun’s prayer for\n“such other relief ” can be reasonably viewed as a request\nfor nominal damages. See Kyle, 196 F.3d at 697 (liberally\nconstruing pro se prayer for $1 million in “monetary\nrelief” as a request for punitive damages).\n\fNo. 98-2894                                             11\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the dismissal of\nCalhoun’s amended complaint insofar as it alleges an\nEighth Amendment violation, and REMAND for further\nproceedings on that claim. In all other respects, the judg-\nment of the district court is AFFIRMED. In light of this\ndecision, the district court erred when it concluded that\nCalhoun had incurred one strike under 28 U.S.C § 1915(g).\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—2-13-03\n\f</pre>",
