Turpin, 155 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir. 1998) and\n\nsubstitute therefor the following opinion.\n\n       Robert Lewis Collier appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In\n\n1978, Collier was convicted in the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia, of felony murder,\n\naggravated assault, and three armed robberies. Collier was sentenced to death for the murder\n\nconviction. The murder occurred as Collier fled from the scene of three armed robberies; the\n\nvictim was a deputy sheriff. Collier’s petition for habeas corpus relief presented a number of\n\nconstitutional challenges to both his convictions and his death sentence. In this appeal, however,\n\nCollier primarily challenges the district court’s conclusion that his death sentence is not\n\nconstitutionally infirm. He contends that, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S. Ct.\n\n2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978), the superior court impermissibly limited the scope of the\n\nmitigating evidence that he was permitted to present to the jury during the sentencing phase of\n\nhis trial. Alternatively, Collier argues that, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nto the Constitution, his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to present\n\nevidence of his background and character that likely would have led the jury to impose a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment rather than of death. We conclude that Collier’s counsel were\n\nineffective, and therefore direct the district court to issue the writ with respect to Collier’s death\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n                                                   I.\n\n                                                  A.\n\f       On April 14, 1978, Collier left his home in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, and drove to\n\nFort Oglethorpe, Georgia, intending to commit a robbery. In Fort Oglethorpe, Collier parked his\n\ncar beside a fast food restaurant, placed a .32 caliber revolver in a grocery bag, and walked to a\n\nnearby floral shop. After entering the shop, Collier drew the revolver and demanded money\n\nfrom the cash register as well as from the four women present in the shop. Collier took the cash\n\nbut allowed the women to keep their purses. After telling them to get down on the floor and put\n\ntheir hands behind their heads, Collier exited the store, walked to his car, placed the sack\n\ncontaining the money and the gun in the trunk, and began driving back toward South Pittsburgh.\n\n       The women in the store immediately called the police, and the Catoosa County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment was notified. Sheriff’s Investigator George Brown responded to the call and began\n\ndriving to the floral shop. While en route, Brown passed Collier driving in the opposite\n\ndirection. Recognizing Collier’s car from the description he had received on his radio, Brown\n\nturned his car around, caught up with Collier, and activated his blue lights. Collier immediately\n\nstopped his car and got out. Collier began walking toward Brown’s car with his wallet in his\n\nhand. Drawing his gun, Brown ordered Collier to “spread eagle” and to place his hands on his\n\ncar. At approximately the same time, Sheriff’s Deputy Baxter Shavers arrived and approached\n\nCollier and Brown with his gun drawn. Seeing Shavers with his gun drawn, Brown holstered his\n\nown weapon and began to pat Collier down.\n\n       Shavers then walked up to Collier and, while pointing his gun at Collier, began to look\n\ninto Collier’s car. Collier grabbed the gun from Shavers, throwing Brown off of him in the\n\nprocess. As Brown attempted to draw his weapon again, Collier fired two shots at him, hitting\n\nhim once in the hip and knocking him to the ground. Shavers had begun running toward his\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fvehicle when Collier turned and fired shots at him. One shot hit Shavers in the neck, killing him\n\ninstantly. Collier got into his car and began to drive away. In the meantime, Brown, still on the\n\nground, had drawn his weapon and fired six harmless shots into Collier’s fleeing automobile.\n\nThe shots failed to disable Collier or his vehicle.\n\n       Collier returned to South Pittsburgh, gathered his wife and their two sons, and drove to\n\nAlabama. The next day, however, Collier decided to return to South Pittsburgh. He was\n\napprehended by Tennessee law enforcement before he reached his home. Within one hour of his\n\narrest, Collier gave a statement to a Tennessee State Trooper that implicated him in the crimes.\n\nCollier then asked for, and received, permission to contact an attorney who previously had\n\nrepresented him. After the attorney arrived, Collier was placed in a lineup and identified as the\n\nperson who had robbed the floral shop and the four customers. Following this identification,\n\nCollier, contrary to his attorney’s advice, waived his right to remain silent and gave a complete\n\nconfession.\n\n       Collier thereafter waived his right to an extradition hearing, and the Sheriff of Catossa\n\nCounty, Georgia, took him into custody. On his return to Georgia, Collier was indicted by a\n\nCatossa County grand jury for felony murder, aggravated assault for the shooting of Brown, and\n\nthree counts of armed robbery.\n\n       The guilt phase of Collier’s trial began on Monday, September 25, 1978, and concluded\n\non Friday, September 29, 1978, at 5:50 p.m.1 The jury found Collier guilty as charged. After the\n\ncourt polled the jury and published the verdicts, the judge announced that the sentencing phase\n\n\n       1\n        Collier was represented at trial by three attorneys, Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and\nJames Secord. See infra note 9. The State was represented by District Attorney William\nCampbell and Assistant District Attorney Craig Gillenn.\n\n                                                  3\n\fof the trial (on the murder charge) would begin that evening, following a two-hour recess for\n\ndinner.2\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. and concluded one hour and twenty-eight\n\nminutes later, at 9:28 p.m., when the jury retired to deliberate. The jury returned its verdict,\n\nimposing the death penalty rather than life imprisonment, at 12:05 a.m. the next morning.3\n\n\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed Collier’s convictions and\n\nsentences for felony murder, aggravated assault, and two of the three armed robberies; the court\n\nreversed Collier’s conviction for one of the armed robbery offenses because it had served as a\n\nlesser included offense of the felony murder. See Collier v. State, 261 S.E.2d 364, 374 (Ga.\n\n1979), overruled in part by Thompson v. State, 426 S.E.2d 895 (1993). Collier’s petition for a\n\nwrit of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court was denied. See Collier v. Georgia, 445\n\nU.S. 946, 100 S. Ct. 1346, 63 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1980). On May 14, 1980, Collier petitioned the\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for a writ of habeas corpus\n\n\n\n       2\n         Neither party objected to proceeding that evening nor requested a continuance until the\nnext day, Saturday, or the following Monday.\n       3\n          The jury based its verdict on the following aggravating circumstances: (1) Collier\ncommitted the murder of Deputy Shavers while committing another capital felony; (2) the victim\nwas a peace officer who, at the time of the murder, was engaged in the performance of his\nofficial duties; and (3) Collier committed the murder for the purpose of preventing his lawful\narrest.\n        The court subsequently implemented the jury’s verdict at the sentencing hearing. In\naddition, the court imposed the following sentences: twenty years imprisonment for the\naggravated assault conviction, and consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment for each of the\nthree armed robbery convictions.\n\n                                                  4\n\fsetting aside his convictions and sentences under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.4 The district court dismissed\n\nthe petition on March 31, 1982, finding that Collier had failed to exhaust his state remedies on a\n\nnumber of his claims for relief.\n\n       On June 23, 1982, Collier filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Superior\n\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia.5 After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition on\n\nDecember 22, 1982, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. See Collier v. Francis, 251 Ga.\n\n512, 307 S.E.2d 485 (1983). On December 22, 1983, Collier filed his second petition for a writ\n\nof habeas corpus in the Northern District of Georgia. On February 28, 1984, the district court\n\ndismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies; we, in turn, denied Collier’s\n\napplication for a certificate of probable cause to appeal.\n\n       On October 22, 1984, Collier filed a second habeas petition in the Superior Court of\n\nButts County. The state moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 9-14-51 on the\n\nground that the petition was successive. The superior court granted the state’s motion and\n\ndismissed the petition on July 2, 1985; the Georgia Supreme Court thereafter denied Collier’s\n\napplication for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. Collier filed his third federal habeas\n\npetition in the Northern District of Georgia on October 6, 1986. Concluding that the petition was\n\na mixed petition within the meaning of Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 102 S. Ct. 1198, 71 L. Ed.\n\n2d 379 (1982), in that it contained both exhausted and unexhausted claims, the court dismissed it\n\non May 13, 1987.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         This was the first of four habeas petitions Collier filed in that court under section 2254;\nthe fourth petition is the one now before us.\n       5\n           Collier filed his petition in that court because he was incarcerated in Butts County.\n\n                                                   5\n\f       In an effort to exhaust all of his claims, Collier returned to the Superior Court of Butts\n\nCounty, filing a third petition for a writ of habeas corpus on September 17, 1987. Following an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the court, on October 12, 1990, rejected the petition without ruling on the\n\nmerits of its claims. The court refused to entertain the merits of some of the claims because they\n\nwere successive, and thus subject to dismissal under O.C.G.A. § 9-14-51; it refused to entertain\n\nthe others on the ground that they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On March 1, 1991,\n\nthe Georgia Supreme Court denied Collier’s application for a certificate of probable cause to\n\nappeal the superior court’s decision.\n\n       On August 9, 1991, Collier filed his fourth petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\n\nNorthern District of Georgia. His petition presented eighteen claims of constitutional error. The\n\nfollowing were among the more significant: (1) during jury selection, the trial court, in violation\n\nof Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968), improperly\n\nprohibited defense counsel from asking the venire persons whether they would automatically\n\nimpose the death penalty upon a finding of guilt – a so-called “reverse-Witherspoon” claim; (2)\n\nthe trial court denied Collier a trial by an impartial jury by refusing to grant Collier a change of\n\nvenue; (3) the Georgia death penalty statute, as applied, was unconstitutionally discriminatory;\n\n(4) the trial court improperly limited the scope of evidence Collier could present at the\n\nsentencing phase of his trial, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L.\n\nEd. 2d 973 (1978); and (5) Collier was denied the effective assistance of counsel, particularly\n\nduring the sentencing phase of his trial.\n\n       The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Collier’s petition on January 27-28,\n\n1994. In a comprehensive order dated February 28, 1995, the court concluded that Collier’s\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fclaims lacked merit and denied relief. On the “reverse-Witherspoon” claim, the court found that\n\nCollier’s counsel attempted to question only two venire persons about their propensity to impose\n\nthe death penalty and that in only one of those cases did the trial judge prevent counsel from\n\ninquiring; moreover, counsel did not object to the court’s ruling in either case. As for the\n\nchange-of-venue issue, the district court found that comprehensive questioning of the venire\n\npersons by the trial judge and counsel revealed no bias against Collier and that the pretrial\n\npublicity was not “so inflammatory and prejudicial as to warrant a change of venue.”\n\n       Turning to Collier’s claim that the death penalty was applied in a discriminatory manner\n\nin Georgia, the district court ruled that the claim failed because Collier had not established that\n\nhis death sentence was the result of discrimination by the decisionmakers in his case. Finally,\n\nwith regard to Collier’s claims of constitutional infirmity at the sentencing phase, the district\n\ncourt found that Collier had neither shown that the trial judge improperly limited the scope of\n\nevidence that he could present in mitigation nor demonstrated that his counsel were ineffective.\n\nThe district court entered its judgment denying the writ on March 1, 1995. Collier thereafter\n\nfiled a motion to alter the judgment, which was denied on April 28, 1995. After the court\n\ngranted Collier’s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal, this appeal followed.6\n\n\n\n                                                 II.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n           We have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994).\n\n                                                  7\n\f         Collier’s brief on appeal raises essentially the same claims as those he presented to the\n\ndistrict court. The majority of his claims lack merit.7 We therefore reject them without\n\ncomment, and limit our discussion to the claim that the sentencing phase of Collier’s trial was\n\nconstitutionally deficient. The gravamen of this claim is that the jury was not presented with the\n\nwealth of available mitigating evidence that would have caused it to impose a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment rather than a sentence of death. Collier contends that the jury did not receive this\n\nevidence for two reasons. First, the trial judge – in an off-the-record chambers conference\n\nshortly before the sentencing phase of the trial began – improperly limited the mitigation\n\nevidence defense counsel could present, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978).\n\nSecond, defense counsel failed to provide the effective assistance of counsel required by the\n\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. We address these two arguments in\n\norder.\n\n\n\n                                                  A.\n\n         The United States Supreme Court decided Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), on July\n\n3, 1978, less than three months prior to Collier’s trial. In Lockett, the Court was presented with\n\n\n\n         7\n          These claims, which challenge Collier’s convictions and/or his sentences, are: (1) that\nthe trial court improperly prohibited defense counsel from inquiring into whether the venire\npersons would automatically impose the death penalty – Collier’s “reverse-Witherspoon” claim;\n(2) that Collier’s death sentence was the result of the racial bias of the decisionmakers; and (3)\nthat the trial court infringed on Collier’s constitutional right of confrontation by admitting\ntestimony of witnesses who had been hypnotized. In addition to advancing these challenges to\nhis convictions and sentences, Collier contends that we should vacate the district court’s\njudgment and remand the case for further proceedings because the district court erred in refusing\nto consider evidence of the racial bias of both the trial judge and his lead defense attorney. This\nclaim is without merit as well.\n\n                                                  8\n\fthe question of whether Ohio “violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by sentencing\n\nSandra Lockett to death pursuant to a statute that narrowly limit[ed] the sentencer’s discretion to\n\nconsider the circumstances of the crime and the record and character of the offender as\n\nmitigating factors.” Id. at 589, 98 S. Ct. at 2956-57 (footnote omitted). The Court found that the\n\n“qualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability\n\nwhen the death sentence is imposed.” Id. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964. The Court concluded,\n\ntherefore, that “the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, [must] not be precluded\n\nfrom considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record and any\n\nof the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than\n\ndeath.” Id. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964-65 (footnote omitted). Collier claims that after the guilt\n\nphase of his trial ended and the sentencing phase began, the court limited the mitigating evidence\n\nthat he could present to the jury in violation of Lockett.\n\n\n\n                                                  1.\n\n       Collier initially raised this Lockett claim on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of\n\nGeorgia, contending that the trial judge, Judge Coker – during an off-the-record conference with\n\ncounsel in chambers shortly before the sentencing phase of the trial was to begin – instructed\n\ndefense counsel that the only mitigating evidence they could introduce would be evidence of\n\nCollier’s reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence of specific acts tending\n\nto mitigate the homicide. As evidence of this off-the-record conference, Collier’s brief to the\n\nsupreme court pointed to an on-the-record-colloquy between the Judge Coker and Donald\n\nBennett, Collier’s lead trial counsel. This conversation took place during the sentencing phase\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fafter Judge Coker, ruling on the State’s objection, refused to allow one of Collier’s mitigation\n\nwitnesses to testify that he and Collier had “mutual respect” for each other. In that colloquy,\n\nJudge Coker said:\n\n       Well, here we go again, you see, Mr. Bennett, evidently our little talk out there,\n       the bantering back and forth didn’t mean very much to you, as to what you were\n       going to do and I told you the problem that we get into by just doing these things,\n       and evidently your memory has become rather short. I know what you told me\n       you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.\n\n(emphasis added). Later in this exchange with Bennett, the judge again referred to a prior\n\ndiscussion, stating, “Well now, Mr. Bennett, I don’t want to get into a hassle with you over the\n\nthing, because I thought we had an understanding back there on the list of questions that you\n\nwould submit to these witnesses.” (emphasis added).\n\n       Despite the above references in the trial transcript, and the fact that Collier’s counsel had\n\nbriefed the issue, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in its opinion disposing of Collier’s appeal,\n\nlimited its discussion to whether Judge Coker improperly excluded the testimony of the witness’\n\n“mutual respect” for Collier. See Collier v. State, 261 S.E.2d 364, 375-76 (Ga. 1979). The\n\nsupreme court held that, although evidence that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence may\n\nbe admissible as mitigation, the witness’ statement about his “mutual respect” for Collier was\n\n“not highly relevant” and “somewhat cumulative”; therefore, Judge Coker had not abused his\n\ndiscretion in excluding it. Id. at 376.8\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The court also noted that defense counsel “did not make any offer of proof of any\nspecific acts of good conduct nor did he attempt to offer evidence of such acts. In fact, the one\nresponse of the witness now in question was the only evidence excluded by the trial court during\nthe sentencing phase of appellant’s trial.” Id.\n\n                                                10\n\f       Collier raised his Lockett claim again in his first state habeas petition to the Butts County\n\nSuperior Court. The court held an evidentiary hearing on October 14, 1982, regarding the\n\nalleged off-the-record conversation between Judge Coker and the defense counsel. Jay Bennett,\n\na member of Collier’s defense team and son of Collier’s lead trial counsel, Donald Bennett,9\n\nrepresented Collier at the evidentiary hearing and testified in place of his father as to the events\n\nof the trial. Jay Bennett testified that, prior to the beginning of the sentencing phase, Judge\n\nCoker summoned him, his father, and the District Attorney, William Campbell, to the court’s\n\nchambers for a conference about the evidence to be presented during the sentencing phase of the\n\ntrial.10 Bennett stated that his father informed Judge Coker that they had fourteen witnesses to\n\npresent and that they intended to have the witnesses testify about specific instances from\n\nCollier’s past. According to Bennett, they told Judge Coker that these witnesses would testify to\n\n       [a] number of specific instances in Mr. Collier’s life, rescuing an individual from\n       drowning, his career in school [in South Pittsburgh], instances where we felt he\n       had proven and that he had made positive contributions to the community. Facts\n       not relating to the crime itself but facts relating to Mr. Collier’s personality, his\n       background. Facts relating to his diabetes and the effect of diabetes on his\n       behavior, when his blood sugar level would be out of balance. And testimony\n       showing the history of his living in that South Pittsburgh community.\n\nJudge Coker refused to allow the proffered testimony, responding, as Bennett related,\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and the third member of Collier’s defense team, James\nSecord, all participated in the prosecution of Collier’s first and second federal habeas corpus\npetitions and his first state habeas corpus petition. Jay Bennett was the only member of the\ndefense team who testified at the October 14, 1982, evidentiary hearing.\n       10\n          Assistant District Attorney Gillenn attended a portion of the chambers conference to\npresent the State’s position on the admissibility of Collier’s Florida conviction for manslaughter,\nwhich the State wished to introduce at the sentencing phase of the trial. According to Gillenn,\nmitigation evidence was not a topic of discussion while he was present.\n\n                                                 11\n\f       in no uncertain terms that we could not go into any evidence relating to the\n       individual except for opinion testimony as to his reputation for truth and veracity.\n       He said this is a criminal trial. You are bound by the rules of evidence. You can\n       introduce evidence relating to the crime itself but no specific facts, no individual\n       opinions, nothing from the accused’s background.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bennett testified that Judge Coker told defense counsel on two occasions\n\nthat the evidence they could present would be limited – first, when Judge Coker met them out on\n\nthe street as he was walking to dinner, and again in the judge’s chambers shortly before the trial\n\nresumed. On the latter occasion, the District Attorney was present.\n\n       After testifying, Jay Bennett called William Campbell to the stand to testify as to his\n\nrecollection of the events in question. Contrary to Bennett’s assertions, Campbell testified that\n\nJudge Coker told defense counsel that he would give them wide latitude to present mitigating\n\nevidence. Campbell stated that “[t]here was no way the Court held them to the rigid rules of\n\nevidence as to the character witness [sic], period.” Campbell testified that the judge’s chambers\n\nconference with counsel prior to the sentencing phase mainly concerned whether the State could\n\npresent evidence of Collier’s prior manslaughter conviction in Florida; Judge Coker ruled against\n\nhim and excluded the evidence. Judge Coker also instructed Campbell to “sit pretty solemn and\n\nquiet” during sentencing.11   Campbell noted that whereas he proffered the evidence (the\n\nconviction) he intended to introduce during the sentencing phase, defense counsel made no\n\nproffer of the evidence they intended to present; in fact, they did not reveal what they intended to\n\npresent until their witnesses took the stand.\n\n\n\n       11\n         On direct examination, Campbell agreed that there were a number of off-the-record\nconferences between the court and counsel. Most of these conferences were between the court\nand defense counsel, who repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea agreement under which\nCollier would receive a life sentence.\n\n                                                12\n\f        Because of health problems, Judge Coker did not appear at the evidentiary hearing. He\n\nwas able to appear for deposition the day after the hearing,12 however; his deposition was made\n\npart of the evidentiary hearing and considered by the court. Judge Coker’s memory of the off-\n\nthe-record conversations with counsel differed substantially from Jay Bennett’s. Judge Coker\n\nrecalled the off-the-record chambers conference he convened between the guilt and sentencing\n\nphases of the trial, and said that he probably advised counsel that the presentation of evidence at\n\nthe sentencing phase would be “governed primarily by the rules of evidence.” He was certain,\n\nhowever, that, after the trial resumed, he permitted defense counsel to go beyond the rules of\n\nevidence and to introduce evidence of Collier’s family life and work habits, as well as whether\n\nor not Collier paid his bills on time. His recollection was that defense counsel proffered as\n\nmitigating evidence no specific acts from Collier’s past, and that he placed no limitation on what\n\ncounsel could ask their witnesses. Judge Coker said that he had no idea of the testimony defense\n\ncounsel intended to elicit from their witnesses; his bottom line was, “ask the question and then\n\nlet me rule on it.”\n\n        Despite holding an evidentiary hearing and taking extensive testimony regarding the\n\nexistence and substance of the off-the-record conference between Judge Coker and counsel, the\n\nsuperior court’s order disposing of Collier’s habeas petition said remarkably little about his\n\nLockett claim. The order merely noted that “[t]he Supreme Court has concluded that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in excluding certain evidence offered in mitigation.” As for the new evidence\n\nadduced at the evidentiary hearing, including Judge Coker’s deposition, the court concluded that\n\nthe evidence failed to establish a Lockett violation.\n\n\n        12\n             At the deposition, Donald Bennett appeared for Collier and questioned Judge Coker.\n\n                                                 13\n\f       Collier appealed the court’s decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. That court, noting\n\nthat the “record of the trial fails to disclose any offer of proof which was made relating to the\n\nrestrictions allegedly placed on counsel,” affirmed the lower court’s ruling that Collier had not\n\ncarried his burden of proving that the trial court, in an off-the-record ruling, had limited the\n\nmitigating evidence the defense could bring before the jury. Collier v. Francis, 307 S.E.2d 485,\n\n487 (Ga. 1983).\n\n       Although Collier renewed his Lockett claim in his next two federal habeas corpus\n\npetitions, the merits of the claim were not reached in either of those actions; both petitions were\n\ndismissed on procedural grounds. The first federal court ruling on the merits of Collier’s Lockett\n\nclaim therefore occurred in the district court proceeding now under review. Based upon its\n\nexamination of the record developed by the Butts County Superior Court in October 1982, the\n\ndistrict court found that the testimony of Collier’s attorney, Jay Bennett, the prosecuting\n\nattorneys, Campbell and Gillenn, and Judge Coker all were credible.13 Because there was a\n\ndirect conflict between the version of the off-the-record conferences offered by defense counsel\n\nand the version recalled by Judge Coker and the prosecutors, the court found the evidence to be\n\n“equal as to what occurred” – in essence that the evidence was in equipoise – and therefore ruled\n\nas a matter of law that Collier had not carried his burden of establishing a Lockett violation.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n         At an evidentiary hearing held on January 27-28, 1994, the district court heard the\ntestimony of two of Collier’s trial attorneys, Jay Bennett – who had testified in the state habeas\ncorpus proceeding in the Butts County Superior Court – and James Secord. The court\ndisregarded their testimony, however, choosing instead to rely on the cold record of the state\nproceeding. The district court disregarded Bennett’s and Secord’s testimony because their\ntestimony did not add to the evidence developed in the state proceeding.\n\n                                                 14\n\f       In reviewing a district court’s resolution of a Lockett claim, we accept the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, and we review the court’s conclusions of law\n\nde novo. Respondent contends, in his brief to this court, that the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthe evidence bearing on Collier’s Lockett claim was “in equipoise” is a factual determination,\n\nand thus subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. We believe that there is only one\n\nway in which evidence of a historical fact may be in equipoise. When a trial court is presented\n\nwith circumstantial evidence that yields equal, opposing inferences, the evidence as to the\n\ninferential facts is in equipoise – neither inference is more likely to be true than the other. We\n\nare not presented with that situation here. Instead, we are presented with a swearing match. One\n\nof Collier’s trial attorneys presents one version of the off-the-record conferences that took place\n\nbefore the sentencing phase of the trial commenced; Judge Coker and the prosecutors present\n\nanother. By finding that the versions presented by both sides of the dispute were “credible,” and\n\nthat the evidence as to what transpired at the conference was therefore in equipoise, the district\n\ncourt made no factual determination at all. The evidence offered by both sides constituted direct,\n\nnot circumstantial, evidence, and a fact finding required a choice between the two contradictory\n\nversions of events. Because the district court did not make such a choice, its determination that\n\nthe evidence is “in equipoise” is entitled to no deference.14\n\n       Ordinarily, we would remand the case to the district court and instruct it to make a\n\ncredibility choice and resolve the dispute. Because in our view only one credibility choice is\n\n\n\n       14\n           In effect, the district court fashioned the following rule to deny Collier relief on his\nclaim: if the court (in a bench trial) could reasonably believe the testimony offered by both sides\nof an issue, the court need not decide which testimony is true – because the evidence is in\nequipoise – and the party with the burden of proof loses.\n\n                                                 15\n\freasonable given the record this case presents, however, we forego a remand and proceed to\n\ndecide both the Lockett issue and Collier’s claim that his attorney’s performance failed to pass\n\nconstitutional muster.\n\n\n\n                                                    2.\n\n          We first note that it is difficult to believe, as Jay Bennett asserted in his testimony before\n\nthe Butts County Superior Court, that Judge Coker would have prohibited Collier’s attorneys\n\nfrom presenting any evidence of character other than Collier’s reputation in the community for\n\ntruth and veracity. Collier did not testify in either the guilt phase or the sentencing phase of the\n\ntrial; thus, his reputation for truth and veracity was entirely irrelevant.15 Such a limitation by the\n\ntrial judge would not simply have violated Lockett, it would have been absurd. Nevertheless,\n\ngiven the conflicting accounts provided by Jay Bennett on the one hand, and Judge Coker,\n\nCampbell, and Gillenn on the other, we look to the transcript of the sentencing phase of the trial\n\nfor evidence that might shed light on what Judge Coker actually said to defense counsel off the\n\nrecord.\n\n          Collier contends that statements made by Judge Coker on the record following the\n\nprosecutor’s objection to the testimony of his third witness, Shelly Jordan – that he had “mutual\n\nrespect” for Collier – support his claim that the judge improperly limited the mitigation evidence\n\n\n\n          15\n         The indictment in this case did not charge Collier with perjury or some other false\nstatement offense as to which his reputation for truth and veracity would be relevant. The only\nstatement made by Collier that was before the jury was his confession to the crimes of murder,\naggravated assault, and armed robbery. By presenting evidence of Collier’s reputation for truth\nand veracity, Collier’s attorneys actually buttressed his confession that he committed those\ncrimes.\n\n                                                    16\n\fhis attorneys could present. The transcript reveals that Collier’s counsel began the sentencing\n\nphase by asking the first two witnesses a few brief questions about their personal history and\n\nassociation with Collier, and then about Collier’s reputation in the community for truth and\n\nveracity, whether the witness would believe Mr. Collier under oath, and little else.16 The third\n\nwitness called to the stand was Shelly Jordan. Donald Bennett began the direct examination of\n\nthe witness by asking foundational questions, apparently as a predicate to inquiring about\n\nCollier’s reputation. The following transpired:\n\n       MR. BENNETT:           What has been your association with Mr. Collier?\n       MR. JORDAN:            Well, we were always close friends, and always got along\n                              well, and had a lot of mutual respect for each other.\n       MR. BENNETT:           Do you have that respect for him now?\n       MR. CAMPBELL:          Your Honor, I object at this time, it’s not what he thinks of\n                              him.\n       THE COURT:             I believe you’ve gone a little far afield, as to his feeling for\n                              the defendant.\n       MR. CAMPBELL:          It’s whether he knows him in the community where he\n                              lives, and not what he thinks about him, but what the\n                              people in that community, it’s not what he thinks, it’s what\n                              the people in the community think.\n       THE COURT:             I think you should be a little more limited in your\n                              examination of the witnesses relative to anything in\n                              mitigation.\n       MR. BENNETT:           Is it Your Honor’s ruling that I cannot ask him his personal\n                              opinion as to what he thinks of this defendant?\n       THE COURT:             His reputation in the community.\n\n(emphasis added). In the ensuing conversation, which took place outside the presence of the jury\n\nbut on the record, Judge Coker acknowledged that there had been some discussion with counsel\n\nprior to the sentencing phase about the evidence the defense could offer. In contrast to Jay\n\n\n\n       16\n          Donald Bennett did ask the first two witnesses whether they considered Collier’s\ncharacter, generally, to be “good” or “bad,” in addition to the questions about his reputation for\ntruthfulness.\n\n                                                  17\n\fBennett’s testimony (at the habeas hearing before the Butts County Superior Court) that Judge\n\nCoker told Collier’s counsel what evidence they could present, however, Judge Coker said, “I\n\nknow what you told me you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.”\n\nMoreover, Judge Coker’s statements on the record belie Bennett’s statement that Judge Coker\n\nrestricted the testimony to Collier’s reputation in the community for truth and veracity and\n\nevidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Judge Coker said:\n\n       I told you that these things that [are] admissible, it’s about his reputation in the\n       community for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things\n       like that, I think that would be mitigating, but because you might have a mutual\n       admiration for him, that is not a mitigating circumstance, and I am going to rule\n       that personal thoughts of him, whether they’re good friends or buddies, it doesn’t\n       really have any bearing on the issues, that’s what I’m trying to say.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       As is apparent from this statement, Judge Coker felt that the testimony regarding the\n\nwitness’ “mutual respect” for Collier was not mitigating evidence. He repeatedly inquired of\n\nDonald Bennett as to how the evidence was mitigating, stating several times that he, personally,\n\ndid not think that the evidence was relevant. In addition, Judge Coker asked how the proffered\n\ntestimony was in “mitigation or extenuation of punishment,” not of the crime itself. Although\n\nthere are indications in the sentencing phase transcript that Judge Coker felt that he was\n\ngenerally bound by the rules of evidence (in fact, he admitted as much during his deposition in\n\nthe state habeas proceeding), there are ample indications that Judge Coker was willing to accept\n\nevidence that would not be admissible under a strict application of the rules of evidence.\n\n       Finally, we note that Donald Bennett asked Judge Coker whether he could ask other\n\nwitnesses the question he had put to Shelly Jordan without being “criticized” by the court. Judge\n\nCoker, as he testified was his practice, responded: “I think you’ll need to ask the question before\n\n                                                18\n\fI make a determination as to whether it’s in mitigation or not, whether it complies with the rules\n\nof evidence.” Bennett did not ask the question again, nor did he make a proffer of any testimony\n\nhe thought Judge Coker had excluded during the off-the-record chambers conference held before\n\nthe sentencing phase commenced. This is not a surprising result, given that Judge Coker did not\n\nlimit or exclude any of the mitigation evidence, other than Shelly Jordan’s statement that he had\n\n“mutual respect” for Collier, that the defense team endeavored to bring before the jury. If Judge\n\nCoker had limited the presentation of mitigating evidence in the way Bennett claims, he likely\n\nwould have excluded other evidence offered by the defense during the sentencing phase; that he\n\ndid not exclude other evidence during the sentencing phase suggests that no such limitations\n\nwere placed on the defense during the pre-sentencing phase conference.\n\n\n\n                                                3.\n\n       We conclude that the record does not support Collier’s claim that the trial court\n\nimproperly limited the scope of the evidence the defense team could offer in mitigation during\n\nthe sentencing phase of the trial. Although the record suggests that defense counsel may have\n\nbeen confused about the extent of the testimony the court would allow them to elicit from their\n\nwitnesses, and that the court may have had a more narrow view than Lockett embraced\n\nconcerning the sort of evidence that could appropriately be admitted during the sentencing phase\n\nof a capital case, the evidence does not support Jay Bennett’s position that Judge Coker told the\n\ndefense team that all he would allow would be testimony of Collier’s reputation in the\n\ncommunity for truth and veracity and evidence of acts mitigating the crime itself. As noted\n\nabove, the only evidence Judge Coker excluded was Shelly Jordan’s statement that he had\n\n\n                                                19\n\f“mutual respect” for Collier – testimony which, although largely irrelevant, arguably should\n\nhave been admitted given the broad latitude accorded to capital defendants to present mitigation\n\nevidence. Furthermore, Judge Coker’s on-the-record statements as to the evidence that, in his\n\nview, would constitute mitigating evidence seriously undermines Jay Bennett’s claim that the\n\nonly evidence that could be introduced was testimony of Collier’s reputation for truth and\n\nveracity and evidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Collier’s Lockett claim accordingly fails.\n\n\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       Collier claims, alternatively, that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance\n\nof counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. First, Collier contends that his attorneys were\n\nineffective because their investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase was deficient; they\n\nfailed to interview and present testimony from numerous close personal friends and relatives\n\nwho could have provided persuasive mitigating evidence, and they failed to explore and present\n\nreadily available expert opinion evidence regarding his diabetes and diffuse organic brain\n\ndamage. Second, Collier contends that counsels’ actual presentation at the sentencing phase of\n\ntrial was ineffective in that they failed to elicit, from the witnesses who did testify, anecdotal\n\nevidence regarding his personal history, diabetic condition, and specific circumstances bearing\n\non the robberies and murder that would have effectively foreclosed the death sentence. Collier\n\ncontends that his attorneys also were ineffective because they failed to object on the record to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fcourt’s perceived (by them) limitation of mitigation evidence and failed to make an offer of\n\nproof as to what his witnesses would have said had they been permitted to testify.17\n\n\n\n                                                 1.\n\n       The first time Collier alleged that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nduring the sentencing phase was in his first state habeas petition. At that time, Collier was still\n\nbeing represented by his defense team. Not surprisingly, then, the claim was not premised upon\n\nvolitional ineffectiveness of trial counsel, but rather upon the same allegations that underpinned\n\nhis Lockett claim – that Judge Coker rendered counsel ineffective when he precluded counsel in\n\nan off-the-record ruling from presenting any substantial mitigating evidence. As it did with\n\nCollier’s Lockett claim, the state habeas court concluded that Collier had not carried his burden\n\nof proof on this ineffective assistance claim. Collier, still represented by his defense team, see\n\nsupra note 9, presented the same claim in his second federal habeas petition, but the petition was\n\ndismissed because Collier had not exhausted his state remedies with respect to all of his claims.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n           In a residual clause in his brief encompassing all of the claims that he presented to the\ndistrict court but, due to space limitation, he was unable to include in his brief, Collier\nincorporated several other grounds for his ineffective assistance claim. To the extent those\ngrounds relate to counsels’ alleged ineffectiveness during the guilt phase of the trial, we believe\nthat the district court properly disposed of them. Our finding that Collier has not demonstrated\nthat his counsel were ineffective in the guilt phase does not affect our examination of their\nperformance in the sentencing phase. We evaluate the attorneys’ performances during each\n“discreet portion[] of a trial without regard to the attorney[s’] performance[s] at other points\nduring the trial.” Horton v. Zant, 941 F.2d 1449, 1461 (11th Cir. 1991).\n         With respect to the additional examples of ineffective assistance in the sentencing phase\nthat Collier presented in this “catch-all” residual clause, we need not consider them given our\nholding that counsel were ineffective in the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                 21\n\f       Collier parted ways with his defense team before filing his second state habeas petition,\n\nthus paving the way for new counsel to claim that Collier’s defense counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance in the sentencing phase of his trial. The petition alleged that counsel were ineffective\n\nfor failing to present “mitigating evidence that would have convinced the jury that Petitioner was\n\nnot ‘some huge, black man,’ as the prosecuting attorney frequently referred to Petitioner, with an\n\nevil and malicious heart that deserved to die.” According to the petition, a wealth of evidence\n\nwas available to demonstrate that Collier was a good family man, an upstanding public citizen\n\nwilling to risk his own injury to help others, and that he was a diabetic who had trouble\n\ncontrolling his behavior when he was not properly medicated. The state habeas court concluded\n\nthat the doctrine of res judicata precluded it from considering Collier’s claim since the claim had\n\nbeen raised in his first state habeas petition. The court concluded, alternatively, that Collier had\n\nwaived any claim of ineffective assistance that he had not raised in his first state habeas petition.\n\n       In Collier’s third federal habeas petition, he raised both claims of ineffective assistance:\n\n(1) that the trial court’s off-the-record-evidentiary ruling had rendered counsel ineffective; and\n\n(2) that counsel were independently ineffective for not objecting on the record to that ruling and\n\nfor failing to present efficacious mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the petition\n\nwithout prejudice because Collier had not exhausted all of his state law claims. In his third and\n\nlast state habeas petition, Collier again alleged that his attorneys’ performance was ineffective,\n\ncalling the court’s attention to two aspects of counsels’ performance that were deficient. The\n\ncourt found that both had been raised – albeit in different forms – in earlier state petitions and\n\ndisposed of, and that the earlier dispositions were res judicata.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Returning to federal court, Collier once again raised his claim of ineffective assistance in\n\nhis fourth habeas petition – the petition under review. The respondent contends that Collier\n\nprocedurally defaulted his claim because he did not assert it until his second state habeas\n\npetition. The district court agreed with respondent and applied the “cause and prejudice” test to\n\ndetermine whether Collier’s failure to follow the applicable state procedural rules precluded his\n\nclaim. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 86-87, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594\n\n(1977) (applying the rule from Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 96 S. Ct. 1708, 48 L. Ed. 2d\n\n149 (1976), which established that petitioners who raise claims in federal habeas corpus petitions\n\nthat are barred by state doctrines of procedural waiver must establish “cause” and “prejudice” for\n\ntheir failure to raise the claims in state court). The court held that Collier had demonstrated\n\nsufficient cause by the fact that he was represented on his first state habeas petition by trial\n\ncounsel. See Stephens v. Kemp, 846 F.2d 642, 651 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that a habeas\n\ncorpus petitioner who did not raise an ineffective assistance claim in his first state habeas\n\npetition satisfied the cause prong of the cause and prejudice test when counsel on the first state\n\nhabeas petition was also trial counsel whose performance was allegedly inadequate).18 The court\n\nthen evaluated Collier’s claim on the merits to determine whether he had established the\n\nprejudice prong of the test as well.\n\n       In its dispositive order of February 28, 1995, the district court ruled that Collier’s counsel\n\nwere not ineffective. The court held that they had pursued a reasonable strategy in investigating\n\nand developing mitigating evidence, and could not be faulted for failing to pursue additional\n\n\n       18\n          We note that, in his brief, respondent has not questioned the district court’s treatment\nof Collier’s procedural default, and therefore we do not address the merits of the procedural\ndefault issue.\n\n                                                  23\n\fanecdotal evidence of Collier’s personal history, diabetic condition, or circumstances leading up\n\nto the crimes. Additionally, the court ruled that Collier’s counsel were not unreasonable for\n\nneglecting to obtain expert opinion testimony regarding his diabetes and the affect of abnormal\n\nblood sugar levels on Collier’s ability to control his behavior as well as expert opinion testimony\n\nconcerning diffuse organic brain damage. The district court also held that if the trial court had\n\nrestricted counsels’ ability to present mitigating evidence during an off-the-record conference\n\nprior to sentencing, in contravention of Lockett, counsel were not “unreasonable in their beliefs\n\nthat they had preserved this issue for appellate review.” Finally, the court stated that it was “not\n\npersuaded that even if Collier’s trial attorneys had done all that his current counsel contend\n\nshould have been done the outcome of the sentencing phase would be different.”\n\n\n\n                                                 2.\n\n       Whether a criminal defendant has received the effective assistance of counsel is a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact and is subject to de novo review. See Bolender v. Singletary, 16 F.3d\n\n1547, 1558 n.12 (11th Cir. 1994). “[S]tate court findings of historical facts made in the course of\n\nevaluating an ineffectiveness claim are subject to the presumption of correctness, and similar\n\nfederal district court findings are deemed correct . . . unless clearly erroneous.” Id. (citing Bush\n\nv. Singletary, 988 F.2d 1082, 1089 (11th Cir. 1993)) (citation omitted). The test for whether\n\ncounsel has provided the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments was articulated by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Under Strickland, a person asserting a claim of\n\nineffective assistance must satisfy a two prong test:\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f                 First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was\n                 deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so\n                 serious that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”\n                 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the\n                 defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n                 defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so\n                 serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose\n                 result is reliable.\n\nId. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. In a capital case, this two part test applies to claims of ineffective\n\nassistance during the sentencing phase as well as the guilt phase of the trial, because a “capital\n\nsentencing proceeding . . . is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence\n\nof standards for decision . . . that counsel’s role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel’s role\n\nat trial – to ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the\n\nstandards governing decision.” Id. at 686-87, 104 S. Ct. at 2064 (citations omitted).\n\n        In subpart i, we examine Collier’s claims of ineffective assistance to determine whether\n\nhe has satisfied the performance prong of the Strickland test. In subpart ii, we determine\n\nwhether Collier has demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the acts and omissions of\n\nhis attorneys.\n\n\n\n                                                   i.\n\n        In order to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel were ineffective,\n\nCollier must demonstrate that their “representation fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness.” Id. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. The performance inquiry thus seeks to\n\ndetermine whether, under “prevailing professional norms,” counsel’s “assistance was reasonable\n\nconsidering all the circumstances.” Id., 104 S. Ct. at 2065. In evaluating Collier’s ineffective\n\nassistance claim, we must give great deference to counsels’ choice of strategy and execution. Id.\n\n                                                  25\n\fat 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (discussing the danger of hindsight in such an evaluation and noting\n\nthat the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged\n\naction “might be considered sound trial strategy”) (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91,\n\n101, 76 S. Ct. 158, 164, 100 L. Ed. 83 (1955)). With these principles in mind, we first examine\n\ncounsels’ investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase, and then their presentation of\n\nmitigating evidence before the jury.\n\n\n\n                                                 a.\n\n       Collier raises two distinct claims of ineffective assistance based on his counsels’ failure\n\nto investigate more fully his personal history as well as his medical and mental condition at the\n\ntime of the crimes. First, he contends that his attorneys failed to interview close relatives and\n\nfriends who could have provided an abundance of information regarding his childhood,\n\neconomic circumstances surrounding his upbringing, social environment in his hometown,\n\ndiabetic condition as well as attendant physical and emotional problems, and specific events in\n\nhis life that would have mitigated the sentence imposed by the jury. He also argues that counsel\n\nfailed to elicit significant mitigating evidence about Collier’s background and character from the\n\nwitnesses that were called at sentencing. Second, Collier claims that his attorneys failed to\n\npursue expert opinion testimony relating to his diabetes and to “diffuse organic brain damage.”\n\nAccording to Collier, such testimony should have been proffered during the sentencing phase to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fshow his reduced capacity to conform his behavior to the law, even if such testimony could not\n\nsupport a legal defense to the crimes themselves.19\n\n       With regard to Collier’s claim that counsel failed to interview a number of close relatives\n\nand friends of Collier that could have provided additional evidence to be used in the sentencing\n\nphase of his trial, the district court found that counsels’ failure to pursue those witnesses’\n\ntestimony was the direct result of a conscious tactical decision. “The question of whether a\n\ndecision by counsel was a tactical one is a question of fact.” Bolender, 16 F.3d at 1558 n.12\n\n(citing Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462). Whether the tactic was reasonable, however, is a question of\n\nlaw and is reviewed de novo. See Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462. In assessing the reasonableness of\n\nthe tactic, we consider “all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to\n\ncounsel’s judgments.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.\n\n       Jay Bennett testified that the defense team thought that if they “could bring out just\n\nexactly what the so-called better class of the community over in Jasper and South Pittsburgh\n\nthought about [Collier], well, that surely the jury would give some consideration to that.”\n\nCollier’s lead defense attorney, Donald Bennett, was from the largely rural area in which the trial\n\nwas held, and was familiar with the attitudes of the local citizenry. He was well-positioned,\n\ntherefore, to determine what testimony would be most well-received by the jury. Bennett\n\nbelieved that the jury would be able to relate to witnesses representing the “governing part of the\n\ncity.” In addition, counsel thought they were limited in the number of witnesses they could\n\n\n\n       19\n         Given our holding that defense counsel were ineffective in failing to elicit more\ntestimony regarding Collier’s upbringing and his mental and physical ailments, it is not\nnecessary for us to determine whether counsel were also ineffective for failing to pursue expert\ntestimony regarding Collier’s diabetic condition or his “diffuse organic brain damage.”\n\n                                                  27\n\fpresent; the out-of-state witnesses from Collier’s hometown in Tennessee had to be subpoenaed,\n\ncourt orders for their appearance had to be obtained, and witness fees had to be tendered.\n\nDonald Bennett traveled to South Pittsburgh and Jasper and interviewed quite a few potential\n\nwitnesses, including Collier’s wife. From those he selected fourteen to subpoena for trial, ten of\n\nwhom were called to testify. They included Collier’s wife, a lifelong friend, people from South\n\nPittsburgh for or with whom Collier had worked and had known for twenty years or more, the\n\nprincipal of Collier’s high school, a member of the South Pittsburgh City Commission, and a\n\nfriend of Collier’s father’s who had known Collier since he was a child.\n\n       As the district court noted, the witnesses whom counsel selected to testify possessed\n\nmuch of the information about Collier’s past and character that Collier now contends should\n\nhave been presented to the jury.20 Although we might think that it would have been more\n\nprudent for Collier’s attorneys to investigate other possible avenues for obtaining information\n\nabout Collier’s character and background, including Collier’s relatives and close friends, “in\n\n\n       20\n          The witnesses whom counsel called to the stand could have testified that Collier’s\nmother died when he was an infant, and that while his father left him in the care of his aunt and\nuncle to raise, he kept Collier’s older brother, and later remarried and had three more children.\nThey could have testified about Collier’s upbringing as a poor black child in a segregated\nsouthern town and about his gentle disposition despite his large stature; that Collier worked from\nan early age to help support himself and his aunt and uncle; that he persevered in school despite\nbeing a slow learner, becoming a football star in high school and then seeing his career end due\nto an injury during his senior year; and that he moved to Seattle after a stint in the army, and then\nreturned to South Pittsburgh to take care of the aunt who had raised him while she was dying of\ncancer. The witnesses could have testified that Collier started a family upon his return to South\nPittsburgh; that he was a devoted father and husband; that he worked hard to provide for his\nfamily; and that, about a month before he committed the crimes in this case, he lost his job with\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority and was nearly out of money when he committed them. At least\none witness, in addition to Collier’s wife, could have testified about Collier’s heroic attempt to\nsave the life of a motorist trapped in a car that had veered off a bridge into a creek. Finally,\nseveral witnesses, and especially Collier’s wife, could have testified that Collier was diabetic and\nthat he was moody and irrational when he had either not taken his insulin or missed a meal.\n\n                                                 28\n\fconsidering claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, ‘[w]e address not what is prudent or\n\nappropriate, but only what is constitutionally compelled.’” Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 794,\n\n107 S. Ct. 3114, 3126, 97 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1987) (quoting United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648,\n\n665 n.38, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2050 n.38, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1984)). Considering all of the\n\ncircumstances from the position of Collier’s counsel at the time of their conduct, see Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066, we cannot conclude that counsel were ineffective for failing\n\nto interview additional potential witnesses in preparation for the sentencing phase.\n\n\n\n                                                 b.\n\n       We next evaluate counsels’ performance during the actual sentencing phase of the trial.\n\nJay Bennett testified that the defense team “knew from the start that the whole case was going to\n\nride on the sentencing phase.” The team’s conclusion is not surprising considering that Collier\n\nhad been tied clearly to the crimes by eyewitness accounts, had given a full confession to\n\nauthorities, and seemed to be of reasonable mental health. In fact, counsel considered having\n\nCollier plead guilty and then proceeding directly to the sentencing phase; William Campbell\n\ntestified that Collier’s defense team repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea of guilty in\n\nexchange for a life sentence. In short, Collier’s attorneys intended to focus their efforts on\n\npresenting evidence that would mitigate Collier’s sentence.\n\n       Counsels’ intention of presenting a strong case in mitigation stands in stark contrast to\n\nthe presentation that actually took place. After briefly summarizing the testimony that counsel\n\nadduced from Collier’s ten mitigation witnesses, we then analyze whether counsels’ performance\n\nfell below the objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. As noted\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fsupra, Collier based his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on two alternative theories: (1)\n\nthat his attorneys’ conduct was constitutionally deficient, or (2) that counsels’ performance was\n\nrendered ineffective by Judge Coker’s ruling limiting the mitigating evidence counsel could\n\npresent. The second theory, the Lockett claim, fails for the reasons stated in subpart A, supra.\n\nAs for Collier’s first theory, we conclude that counsels’ performance did not comport with the\n\nstandards of the profession and was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances; hence,\n\nthe performance constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night.21 The defense team called ten\n\nwitnesses to the stand. Despite their acknowledgment that the sentencing phase was the most\n\nimportant part of the trial, their examination of the witnesses was minimal. Counsel sought to\n\nelicit very little relevant evidence about Collier’s character. In fact, with respect to a number of\n\nwitnesses, counsel sought only their opinion of Collier’s reputation for truth and veracity – a\n\nmatter wholly irrelevant to the issue before the jury.22 Furthermore, even when counsel departed\n\n\n       21\n           The District Attorney, William Campbell, testified in the habeas hearing in the Butts\nCounty Superior Court that neither party objected to beginning the sentencing phase at that hour,\nalthough both he and Donald Bennett were tired. They did not object because the two men\nstruck a deal; Campbell’s assistant, Craig Gillenn, would make the State’s closing argument to\nthe jury, and Bennett’s assistant, James Secord, would present Collier’s argument.\n       22\n          We note that Judge Coker actually prompted Donald Bennett to ask other questions of\nCollier’s witnesses; the judge reminded Bennett of his earlier advice – that Collier’s reputation\n“for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that” would be\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Despite Judge Coker’s prompting, and his admonition at the\nconclusion of the colloquy over witness Shelly Jordan’s “mutual respect” testimony, that Bennett\nwould need to ask questions before the court could rule on the admissibility of the testimony\nsuch questions would elicit, Bennett’s direct examination of subsequent defense witnesses failed\nto explore in any significant way the witnesses’ knowledge of Collier. Bennett raced through the\nremaining witnesses, eliciting very little in the way of mitigating evidence from any of them, and\nnot once making a proffer of additional evidence in response to what he perceived to be an\nadverse exclusionary ruling by the court.\n\n                                                 30\n\ffrom the truth-and-veracity line of questioning, the testimony elicited was of a nature that could\n\nnot reasonably have aided the jury in its sentence determination.\n\n       For instance, Collier’s eighth witness was his wife, Mary Collier. After establishing that\n\nCollier and Mary had been married five years and had two children, both boys, ages three and\n\nfive, the remainder of her direct examination consisted of the following:\n\n       MR. BENNETT:            And since you have been married, has Robert supported his\n                               family?\n       MRS. COLLIER:           Yes, he has.\n       MR. BENNETT:            Has he been a hard worker?\n       MRS. COLLIER:           Yes, sir.\n       MR. BENNETT:            I believe that’s all I need to ask her.\n\nOn cross-examination, the prosecution had Mary Collier testify that she received $70 from\n\nCollier on the day of the crimes, money that she now knew he had stolen from the floral shop.\n\nOn re-direct examination, Donald Bennett established that she was not aware of the crimes when\n\nshe accepted the money.\n\n       Counsel elicited little more mitigation testimony of substance from the other nine\n\nwitnesses called on Collier’s behalf. After the presentation of mitigating evidence ended, the\n\ncourt declared a brief recess. Following the recess, counsel delivered their closing arguments,\n\nand the court charged the jury. The jury retired to deliberate at 9:28 p.m. At 12:05 a.m. the next\n\nmorning, the jury returned its verdict.\n\n       In analyzing this claim of ineffective counsel, we note that defense counsel did elicit\n\ntestimony that Collier had a “good” reputation, that he was generally known as a hard worker\n\nwho took care of his family, and that he had a good reputation for truth and veracity. The trial\n\ntranscript, however, does not support the proposition that counsels’ performance met the\n\nstandard of objective reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel presented no\n\n                                                31\n\fmore than a hollow shell of the testimony necessary for a “particularized consideration of\n\nrelevant aspects of the character and record of [a] convicted defendant before the imposition\n\nupon him of a sentence of death.” Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303, 96 S. Ct.\n\n2978, 2991, 49 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1976). Although counsel were aware of the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion in Lockett, and recognized that the sentencing phase was the most important part of the\n\ntrial given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, they presented almost none of the readily\n\navailable evidence of Collier’s background and character that would have led the jury to eschew\n\nthe death penalty. Instead of developing an image of Collier as a human being who was\n\ngenerally a good family man and a good public citizen, who had a background of poverty but\n\nwho had worked hard as a child and as an adult to support his family and close relatives,\n\ncounsels’ presentation tended to give the impression that the witnesses knew little or nothing\n\nabout Collier. In failing to present any of the available evidence of Collier’s upbringing, his\n\ngentle disposition, his record of helping family in times of need, specific instances of his heroism\n\nand compassion, and evidence of his circumstances at the time of the crimes – including his\n\nrecent loss of his job, his poverty, and his diabetic condition – counsels’ performance brought\n\ninto question the reliability of the jury’s determination that death was the appropriate sentence.\n\nSee Woodson, 428 U.S. at 305, 96 S. Ct. at 2991 (noting the qualitative difference in the need for\n\nreliability in a jury’s determination that death is appropriate in a capital case).\n\n       Although Collier’s attorneys concede that their performance was deficient, they blame\n\nthe trial judge rather than themselves for their poor display. We find that the trial judge was not\n\nto blame for counsels’ ineffectiveness; rather, they were. In sum, counsel did not perform as\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fobjectively reasonable attorneys would have; their performance fell below the standards of the\n\nprofession and therefore their assistance at the sentencing phase of the trial was ineffective.\n\n\n\n                                                 ii.\n\n       Being satisfied that Collier has demonstrated that his attorneys’ performance at the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial fell below the standard or reasonableness required by the Sixth\n\nAmendment, we must now determine whether counsels’ inadequate performance during the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial prejudiced Collier. The Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he\n\npurpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the\n\nassistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 691-92, 104 S. Ct. at 2067. To satisfy the prejudice prong of the analysis, therefore, “[t]he\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\n\n       Collier has sufficiently demonstrated that the failure of his counsel to make an offer of\n\nproof on the record, or effectively to present at sentencing the wealth of mitigating evidence,\n\ncreates a reasonable probability that, but for their errors, he would not have received a death\n\nsentence. “The purpose of a sentencing hearing is to provide the jury with the information\n\nnecessary for it to render an individualized sentencing determination . . . [based upon] the\n\ncharacter and record of the individualized offender and the circumstances of the particular\n\noffense.” Dobbs v. Turpin, 142 F.3d 1383, 1386-87 (11th Cir. 1998) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted). The errors of Collier’s counsel in the sentencing phase frustrated that\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fpurpose; counsel presented ten separate witnesses, including Collier’s wife, whose relevant\n\ntestimony consisted almost entirely of one or two word answers to inquiries as to Collier’s\n\ngeneral reputation in the community, his reputation for truth and veracity, his reputation for hard\n\nwork, and his reputation as a man who supports his family. The testimony of Collier’s trial\n\ncounsel in his habeas corpus proceedings, as well as the affidavits of persons who either were\n\ninterviewed by trial counsel but not called to testify or who testified before the jury,\n\ndemonstrates that counsel were aware of numerous facts from Collier’s history that would have\n\nled the jury to forego the death penalty.\n\n       In evaluating the probability that Collier’s jury would have rejected the death penalty, we\n\nmust not forget to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors that would have been before\n\nthe jury in the absence of his counsels’ errors. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.\n\nThe district court held that even if defense counsel were ineffective in every way alleged in\n\nCollier’s petition, Collier would be unable to demonstrate prejudice because:\n\n       [t]he murder took place following an armed robbery; it involved a defendant who\n       wrested a police officer’s gun from him, shot one officer, and then turned and\n       killed the officer whose gun he had taken; and the murder occurred in a rural\n       community, where the murdered officer was widely known.\n\nThe first two factors listed by the district court generally represent the aggravating circumstances\n\nof Collier’s murder conviction: he killed a police officer while trying to prevent his arrest for the\n\ncommission of another felony. Although we do not underestimate the strength of these\n\naggravating factors, we believe that there is at least a reasonable probability that a jury\n\nconfronted with the stark contrast between Collier’s acts on the day of the crimes and his history\n\nwould not have voted for the death sentence. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390 (quoting Jackson v.\n\nHerring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995), for the proposition that “[m]any death penalty\n\n                                                 34\n\fcases involve murders that are carefully planned, or accompanied by torture, rape, or\n\nkidnaping”). Had counsel presented the wealth of mitigating evidence that they gathered in\n\npreparation for the sentencing phase of the trial, see supra note 20, we believe there is a\n\nreasonable probability that consideration of these facts would have led the jury to a different\n\nresult. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390-91 (affirming grant of the writ in case where evidence of\n\n“unfortunate upbringing” was not investigated by counsel and not presented during the\n\nsentencing phase of defendant’s trial).\n\n       On the other hand, the third factor listed by the district court – that the murder occurred\n\nin a rural community where the officer was widely known – seems to suggest that the people of\n\nthe community could not adequately put aside their anger about the crime to reach a detached\n\nand informed sentencing decision based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the\n\ncase. Although taking into account the righteous anger of the jurors at the killing of a person\n\nwell-known to them might have given the district court a more accurate idea of whether a 1978\n\nCatoosa County jury would have opted for a sentence of life imprisonment had they heard all of\n\nthe mitigating evidence, such considerations run afoul of Strickland. “The assessment of\n\nprejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,\n\nconscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.” Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2068 (emphasis added). We must therefore assume that the jurors\n\ncould put aside their passions and render a sentence based upon the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances of the case as presented to them. Under such an assumption, we believe that the\n\njury would have come to a different result.\n\n       In conclusion, we reiterate the Supreme Court’s statement in Strickland that\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the\n       proceeding whose result is being challenged. In every case the court should be\n       concerned with whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, the result of\n       the particular proceeding is unreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial\n       process that our system counts on to produce just results.\n\nId. at 696, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. By failing to present evidence of Collier’s background that would\n\nhave mitigated his sentence, Collier’s counsel precipitated a “breakdown in the adversarial\n\nprocess.” The jury was called upon to determine whether a man whom they did not know would\n\nlive or die; they were not presented with the particularized circumstances of his past and of his\n\nactions on the day of the crime that would have allowed them fairly to balance the seriousness of\n\nhis transgressions with the conditions of his life. Had they been able to do so, we believe that it\n\nis at least reasonably probable that the jury would have returned a sentence other than death.\n\n\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Robert Lewis Collier did not receive the effective\n\nassistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\n\nStates Constitution, at the sentencing phase of his trial. We therefore AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt’s denial of Collier’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his convictions,\n\nREVERSE the ruling of the district court denying Collier’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwith respect to his sentence of death, and REMAND this case, with the instruction that the\n\ndistrict court grant the writ of habeas corpus vacating Collier’s sentence of death.\n\n\n\n       AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f",

In\n\n1978, Collier was convicted in the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia, of felony murder,\n\naggravated assault, and three armed robberies. Collier was sentenced to death for the murder\n\nconviction. The murder occurred as Collier fled from the scene of three armed robberies; the\n\nvictim was a deputy sheriff. Collier’s petition for habeas corpus relief presented a number of\n\nconstitutional challenges to both his convictions and his death sentence. In this appeal, however,\n\nCollier primarily challenges the district court’s conclusion that his death sentence is not\n\nconstitutionally infirm. He contends that, in violation of Lockett v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Alternatively, Collier argues that, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nto the Constitution, his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to present\n\nevidence of his background and character that likely would have led the jury to impose a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment rather than of death. We conclude that Collier’s counsel were\n\nineffective, and therefore direct the district court to issue the writ with respect to Collier’s death\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n                                                   I.\n\n                                                  A.\n\f       On April 14, 1978, Collier left his home in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, and drove to\n\nFort Oglethorpe, Georgia, intending to commit a robbery. In Fort Oglethorpe, Collier parked his\n\ncar beside a fast food restaurant, placed a .32 caliber revolver in a grocery bag, and walked to a\n\nnearby floral shop. After entering the shop, Collier drew the revolver and demanded money\n\nfrom the cash register as well as from the four women present in the shop. Collier took the cash\n\nbut allowed the women to keep their purses. After telling them to get down on the floor and put\n\ntheir hands behind their heads, Collier exited the store, walked to his car, placed the sack\n\ncontaining the money and the gun in the trunk, and began driving back toward South Pittsburgh.\n\n       The women in the store immediately called the police, and the Catoosa County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment was notified. Sheriff’s Investigator George Brown responded to the call and began\n\ndriving to the floral shop. While en route, Brown passed Collier driving in the opposite\n\ndirection. Recognizing Collier’s car from the description he had received on his radio, Brown\n\nturned his car around, caught up with Collier, and activated his blue lights. Collier immediately\n\nstopped his car and got out. Collier began walking toward Brown’s car with his wallet in his\n\nhand. Drawing his gun, Brown ordered Collier to “spread eagle” and to place his hands on his\n\ncar. At approximately the same time, Sheriff’s Deputy Baxter Shavers arrived and approached\n\nCollier and Brown with his gun drawn. Seeing Shavers with his gun drawn, Brown holstered his\n\nown weapon and began to pat Collier down.\n\n       Shavers then walked up to Collier and, while pointing his gun at Collier, began to look\n\ninto Collier’s car. Collier grabbed the gun from Shavers, throwing Brown off of him in the\n\nprocess. As Brown attempted to draw his weapon again, Collier fired two shots at him, hitting\n\nhim once in the hip and knocking him to the ground. Shavers had begun running toward his\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fvehicle when Collier turned and fired shots at him. One shot hit Shavers in the neck, killing him\n\ninstantly. Collier got into his car and began to drive away. In the meantime, Brown, still on the\n\nground, had drawn his weapon and fired six harmless shots into Collier’s fleeing automobile.\n\nThe shots failed to disable Collier or his vehicle.\n\n       Collier returned to South Pittsburgh, gathered his wife and their two sons, and drove to\n\nAlabama. The next day, however, Collier decided to return to South Pittsburgh. He was\n\napprehended by Tennessee law enforcement before he reached his home. Within one hour of his\n\narrest, Collier gave a statement to a Tennessee State Trooper that implicated him in the crimes.\n\nCollier then asked for, and received, permission to contact an attorney who previously had\n\nrepresented him. After the attorney arrived, Collier was placed in a lineup and identified as the\n\nperson who had robbed the floral shop and the four customers. Following this identification,\n\nCollier, contrary to his attorney’s advice, waived his right to remain silent and gave a complete\n\nconfession.\n\n       Collier thereafter waived his right to an extradition hearing, and the Sheriff of Catossa\n\nCounty, Georgia, took him into custody. On his return to Georgia, Collier was indicted by a\n\nCatossa County grand jury for felony murder, aggravated assault for the shooting of Brown, and\n\nthree counts of armed robbery.\n\n       The guilt phase of Collier’s trial began on Monday, September 25, 1978, and concluded\n\non Friday, September 29, 1978, at 5:50 p.m.1 The jury found Collier guilty as charged. After the\n\ncourt polled the jury and published the verdicts, the judge announced that the sentencing phase\n\n\n       1\n        Collier was represented at trial by three attorneys, Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and\nJames Secord. See infra note 9. The State was represented by District Attorney William\nCampbell and Assistant District Attorney Craig Gillenn.\n\n                                                  3\n\fof the trial (on the murder charge) would begin that evening, following a two-hour recess for\n\ndinner.2\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. and concluded one hour and twenty-eight\n\nminutes later, at 9:28 p.m., when the jury retired to deliberate. The jury returned its verdict,\n\nimposing the death penalty rather than life imprisonment, at 12:05 a.m. the next morning.3\n\n\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed Collier’s convictions and\n\nsentences for felony murder, aggravated assault, and two of the three armed robberies; the court\n\nreversed Collier’s conviction for one of the armed robbery offenses because it had served as a\n\nlesser included offense of the felony murder.

In\naddition, the court imposed the following sentences: twenty years imprisonment for the\naggravated assault conviction, and consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment for each of the\nthree armed robbery convictions.\n\n                                                  4\n\fsetting aside his convictions and sentences under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.4 The district court dismissed\n\nthe petition on March 31, 1982, finding that Collier had failed to exhaust his state remedies on a\n\nnumber of his claims for relief.\n\n       On June 23, 1982, Collier filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Superior\n\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia.5 After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the petition on\n\nDecember 22, 1982, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.

In a comprehensive order dated February 28, 1995, the court concluded that Collier’s\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fclaims lacked merit and denied relief. On the “reverse-Witherspoon” claim, the court found that\n\nCollier’s counsel attempted to question only two venire persons about their propensity to impose\n\nthe death penalty and that in only one of those cases did the trial judge prevent counsel from\n\ninquiring; moreover, counsel did not object to the court’s ruling in either case. As for the\n\nchange-of-venue issue, the district court found that comprehensive questioning of the venire\n\npersons by the trial judge and counsel revealed no bias against Collier and that the pretrial\n\npublicity was not “so inflammatory and prejudicial as to warrant a change of venue.”\n\n       Turning to Collier’s claim that the death penalty was applied in a discriminatory manner\n\nin Georgia, the district court ruled that the claim failed because Collier had not established that\n\nhis death sentence was the result of discrimination by the decisionmakers in his case. Finally,\n\nwith regard to Collier’s claims of constitutional infirmity at the sentencing phase, the district\n\ncourt found that Collier had neither shown that the trial judge improperly limited the scope of\n\nevidence that he could present in mitigation nor demonstrated that his counsel were ineffective.\n\nThe district court entered its judgment denying the writ on March 1, 1995. Collier thereafter\n\nfiled a motion to alter the judgment, which was denied on April 28, 1995. After the court\n\ngranted Collier’s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal, this appeal followed.6\n\n\n\n                                                 II.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n           We have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994).\n\n                                                  7\n\f         Collier’s brief on appeal raises essentially the same claims as those he presented to the\n\ndistrict court. The majority of his claims lack merit.7 We therefore reject them without\n\ncomment, and limit our discussion to the claim that the sentencing phase of Collier’s trial was\n\nconstitutionally deficient. The gravamen of this claim is that the jury was not presented with the\n\nwealth of available mitigating evidence that would have caused it to impose a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment rather than a sentence of death. Collier contends that the jury did not receive this\n\nevidence for two reasons. First, the trial judge – in an off-the-record chambers conference\n\nshortly before the sentencing phase of the trial began – improperly limited the mitigation\n\nevidence defense counsel could present, in violation of Lockett v.

In Lockett, the Court was presented with\n\n\n\n         7\n          These claims, which challenge Collier’s convictions and/or his sentences, are: (1) that\nthe trial court improperly prohibited defense counsel from inquiring into whether the venire\npersons would automatically impose the death penalty – Collier’s “reverse-Witherspoon” claim;\n(2) that Collier’s death sentence was the result of the racial bias of the decisionmakers; and (3)\nthat the trial court infringed on Collier’s constitutional right of confrontation by admitting\ntestimony of witnesses who had been hypnotized. In addition to advancing these challenges to\nhis convictions and sentences, Collier contends that we should vacate the district court’s\njudgment and remand the case for further proceedings because the district court erred in refusing\nto consider evidence of the racial bias of both the trial judge and his lead defense attorney. This\nclaim is without merit as well.\n\n                                                  8\n\fthe question of whether Ohio “violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by sentencing\n\nSandra Lockett to death pursuant to a statute that narrowly limit[ed] the sentencer’s discretion to\n\nconsider the circumstances of the crime and the record and character of the offender as\n\nmitigating factors.” Id. at 589, 98 S. Ct. at 2956-57 (footnote omitted). The Court found that the\n\n“qualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability\n\nwhen the death sentence is imposed.” Id. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964. The Court concluded,\n\ntherefore, that “the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, [must] not be precluded\n\nfrom considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record and any\n\nof the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than\n\ndeath.” Id. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964-65 (footnote omitted). Collier claims that after the guilt\n\nphase of his trial ended and the sentencing phase began, the court limited the mitigating evidence\n\nthat he could present to the jury in violation of Lockett.\n\n\n\n                                                  1.\n\n       Collier initially raised this Lockett claim on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of\n\nGeorgia, contending that the trial judge, Judge Coker – during an off-the-record conference with\n\ncounsel in chambers shortly before the sentencing phase of the trial was to begin – instructed\n\ndefense counsel that the only mitigating evidence they could introduce would be evidence of\n\nCollier’s reputation in the community for truth and veracity and evidence of specific acts tending\n\nto mitigate the homicide. As evidence of this off-the-record conference, Collier’s brief to the\n\nsupreme court pointed to an on-the-record-colloquy between the Judge Coker and Donald\n\nBennett, Collier’s lead trial counsel. This conversation took place during the sentencing phase\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fafter Judge Coker, ruling on the State’s objection, refused to allow one of Collier’s mitigation\n\nwitnesses to testify that he and Collier had “mutual respect” for each other. In that colloquy,\n\nJudge Coker said:\n\n       Well, here we go again, you see, Mr. Bennett, evidently our little talk out there,\n       the bantering back and forth didn’t mean very much to you, as to what you were\n       going to do and I told you the problem that we get into by just doing these things,\n       and evidently your memory has become rather short. I know what you told me\n       you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.\n\n(emphasis added). Later in this exchange with Bennett, the judge again referred to a prior\n\ndiscussion, stating, “Well now, Mr. Bennett, I don’t want to get into a hassle with you over the\n\nthing, because I thought we had an understanding back there on the list of questions that you\n\nwould submit to these witnesses.” (emphasis added).\n\n       Despite the above references in the trial transcript, and the fact that Collier’s counsel had\n\nbriefed the issue, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in its opinion disposing of Collier’s appeal,\n\nlimited its discussion to whether Judge Coker improperly excluded the testimony of the witness’\n\n“mutual respect” for Collier. See Collier v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1263560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1263560/collier-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375-76 (Ga. 1979). The\n\nsupreme court held that, although evidence that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence may\n\nbe admissible as mitigation, the witness’ statement about his “mutual respect” for Collier was\n\n“not highly relevant” and “somewhat cumulative”; therefore, Judge Coker had not abused his\n\ndiscretion in excluding it. Id. at 376.8\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The court also noted that defense counsel “did not make any offer of proof of any\nspecific acts of good conduct nor did he attempt to offer evidence of such acts. In fact, the one\nresponse of the witness now in question was the only evidence excluded by the trial court during\nthe sentencing phase of appellant’s trial.” Id.\n\n                                                10\n\f       Collier raised his Lockett claim again in his first state habeas petition to the Butts County\n\nSuperior Court. The court held an evidentiary hearing on October 14, 1982, regarding the\n\nalleged off-the-record conversation between Judge Coker and the defense counsel. Jay Bennett,\n\na member of Collier’s defense team and son of Collier’s lead trial counsel, Donald Bennett,9\n\nrepresented Collier at the evidentiary hearing and testified in place of his father as to the events\n\nof the trial. Jay Bennett testified that, prior to the beginning of the sentencing phase, Judge\n\nCoker summoned him, his father, and the District Attorney, William Campbell, to the court’s\n\nchambers for a conference about the evidence to be presented during the sentencing phase of the\n\ntrial.10 Bennett stated that his father informed Judge Coker that they had fourteen witnesses to\n\npresent and that they intended to have the witnesses testify about specific instances from\n\nCollier’s past. According to Bennett, they told Judge Coker that these witnesses would testify to\n\n       [a] number of specific instances in Mr. Collier’s life, rescuing an individual from\n       drowning, his career in school [in South Pittsburgh], instances where we felt he\n       had proven and that he had made positive contributions to the community. Facts\n       not relating to the crime itself but facts relating to Mr. Collier’s personality, his\n       background. Facts relating to his diabetes and the effect of diabetes on his\n       behavior, when his blood sugar level would be out of balance. And testimony\n       showing the history of his living in that South Pittsburgh community.\n\nJudge Coker refused to allow the proffered testimony, responding, as Bennett related,\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         Donald Bennett, Jay Bennett, and the third member of Collier’s defense team, James\nSecord, all participated in the prosecution of Collier’s first and second federal habeas corpus\npetitions and his first state habeas corpus petition. Jay Bennett was the only member of the\ndefense team who testified at the October 14, 1982, evidentiary hearing.\n       10\n          Assistant District Attorney Gillenn attended a portion of the chambers conference to\npresent the State’s position on the admissibility of Collier’s Florida conviction for manslaughter,\nwhich the State wished to introduce at the sentencing phase of the trial. According to Gillenn,\nmitigation evidence was not a topic of discussion while he was present.\n\n                                                 11\n\f       in no uncertain terms that we could not go into any evidence relating to the\n       individual except for opinion testimony as to his reputation for truth and veracity.\n       He said this is a criminal trial. You are bound by the rules of evidence. You can\n       introduce evidence relating to the crime itself but no specific facts, no individual\n       opinions, nothing from the accused’s background.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bennett testified that Judge Coker told defense counsel on two occasions\n\nthat the evidence they could present would be limited – first, when Judge Coker met them out on\n\nthe street as he was walking to dinner, and again in the judge’s chambers shortly before the trial\n\nresumed. On the latter occasion, the District Attorney was present.\n\n       After testifying, Jay Bennett called William Campbell to the stand to testify as to his\n\nrecollection of the events in question. Contrary to Bennett’s assertions, Campbell testified that\n\nJudge Coker told defense counsel that he would give them wide latitude to present mitigating\n\nevidence. Campbell stated that “[t]here was no way the Court held them to the rigid rules of\n\nevidence as to the character witness [sic], period.” Campbell testified that the judge’s chambers\n\nconference with counsel prior to the sentencing phase mainly concerned whether the State could\n\npresent evidence of Collier’s prior manslaughter conviction in Florida; Judge Coker ruled against\n\nhim and excluded the evidence. Judge Coker also instructed Campbell to “sit pretty solemn and\n\nquiet” during sentencing.11   Campbell noted that whereas he proffered the evidence (the\n\nconviction) he intended to introduce during the sentencing phase, defense counsel made no\n\nproffer of the evidence they intended to present; in fact, they did not reveal what they intended to\n\npresent until their witnesses took the stand.\n\n\n\n       11\n         On direct examination, Campbell agreed that there were a number of off-the-record\nconferences between the court and counsel. Most of these conferences were between the court\nand defense counsel, who repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea agreement under which\nCollier would receive a life sentence.\n\n                                                12\n\f        Because of health problems, Judge Coker did not appear at the evidentiary hearing. He\n\nwas able to appear for deposition the day after the hearing,12 however; his deposition was made\n\npart of the evidentiary hearing and considered by the court. Judge Coker’s memory of the off-\n\nthe-record conversations with counsel differed substantially from Jay Bennett’s. Judge Coker\n\nrecalled the off-the-record chambers conference he convened between the guilt and sentencing\n\nphases of the trial, and said that he probably advised counsel that the presentation of evidence at\n\nthe sentencing phase would be “governed primarily by the rules of evidence.” He was certain,\n\nhowever, that, after the trial resumed, he permitted defense counsel to go beyond the rules of\n\nevidence and to introduce evidence of Collier’s family life and work habits, as well as whether\n\nor not Collier paid his bills on time. His recollection was that defense counsel proffered as\n\nmitigating evidence no specific acts from Collier’s past, and that he placed no limitation on what\n\ncounsel could ask their witnesses. Judge Coker said that he had no idea of the testimony defense\n\ncounsel intended to elicit from their witnesses; his bottom line was, “ask the question and then\n\nlet me rule on it.”\n\n        Despite holding an evidentiary hearing and taking extensive testimony regarding the\n\nexistence and substance of the off-the-record conference between Judge Coker and counsel, the\n\nsuperior court’s order disposing of Collier’s habeas petition said remarkably little about his\n\nLockett claim. The order merely noted that “[t]he Supreme Court has concluded that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in excluding certain evidence offered in mitigation.” As for the new evidence\n\nadduced at the evidentiary hearing, including Judge Coker’s deposition, the court concluded that\n\nthe evidence failed to establish a Lockett violation.\n\n\n        12\n             At the deposition, Donald Bennett appeared for Collier and questioned Judge Coker.\n\n                                                 13\n\f       Collier appealed the court’s decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. That court, noting\n\nthat the “record of the trial fails to disclose any offer of proof which was made relating to the\n\nrestrictions allegedly placed on counsel,” affirmed the lower court’s ruling that Collier had not\n\ncarried his burden of proving that the trial court, in an off-the-record ruling, had limited the\n\nmitigating evidence the defense could bring before the jury. Collier v. Francis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1227479\"><a href=\"/opinion/1227479/collier-v-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n487 (Ga. 1983).\n\n       Although Collier renewed his Lockett claim in his next two federal habeas corpus\n\npetitions, the merits of the claim were not reached in either of those actions; both petitions were\n\ndismissed on procedural grounds. The first federal court ruling on the merits of Collier’s Lockett\n\nclaim therefore occurred in the district court proceeding now under review. Based upon its\n\nexamination of the record developed by the Butts County Superior Court in October 1982, the\n\ndistrict court found that the testimony of Collier’s attorney, Jay Bennett, the prosecuting\n\nattorneys, Campbell and Gillenn, and Judge Coker all were credible.13 Because there was a\n\ndirect conflict between the version of the off-the-record conferences offered by defense counsel\n\nand the version recalled by Judge Coker and the prosecutors, the court found the evidence to be\n\n“equal as to what occurred” – in essence that the evidence was in equipoise – and therefore ruled\n\nas a matter of law that Collier had not carried his burden of establishing a Lockett violation.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n         At an evidentiary hearing held on January 27-28, 1994, the district court heard the\ntestimony of two of Collier’s trial attorneys, Jay Bennett – who had testified in the state habeas\ncorpus proceeding in the Butts County Superior Court – and James Secord. The court\ndisregarded their testimony, however, choosing instead to rely on the cold record of the state\nproceeding. The district court disregarded Bennett’s and Secord’s testimony because their\ntestimony did not add to the evidence developed in the state proceeding.\n\n                                                 14\n\f       In reviewing a district court’s resolution of a Lockett claim, we accept the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, and we review the court’s conclusions of law\n\nde novo. Respondent contends, in his brief to this court, that the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthe evidence bearing on Collier’s Lockett claim was “in equipoise” is a factual determination,\n\nand thus subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. We believe that there is only one\n\nway in which evidence of a historical fact may be in equipoise. When a trial court is presented\n\nwith circumstantial evidence that yields equal, opposing inferences, the evidence as to the\n\ninferential facts is in equipoise – neither inference is more likely to be true than the other. We\n\nare not presented with that situation here. Instead, we are presented with a swearing match. One\n\nof Collier’s trial attorneys presents one version of the off-the-record conferences that took place\n\nbefore the sentencing phase of the trial commenced; Judge Coker and the prosecutors present\n\nanother. By finding that the versions presented by both sides of the dispute were “credible,” and\n\nthat the evidence as to what transpired at the conference was therefore in equipoise, the district\n\ncourt made no factual determination at all. The evidence offered by both sides constituted direct,\n\nnot circumstantial, evidence, and a fact finding required a choice between the two contradictory\n\nversions of events. Because the district court did not make such a choice, its determination that\n\nthe evidence is “in equipoise” is entitled to no deference.14\n\n       Ordinarily, we would remand the case to the district court and instruct it to make a\n\ncredibility choice and resolve the dispute. Because in our view only one credibility choice is\n\n\n\n       14\n           In effect, the district court fashioned the following rule to deny Collier relief on his\nclaim: if the court (in a bench trial) could reasonably believe the testimony offered by both sides\nof an issue, the court need not decide which testimony is true – because the evidence is in\nequipoise – and the party with the burden of proof loses.\n\n                                                 15\n\freasonable given the record this case presents, however, we forego a remand and proceed to\n\ndecide both the Lockett issue and Collier’s claim that his attorney’s performance failed to pass\n\nconstitutional muster.\n\n\n\n                                                    2.\n\n          We first note that it is difficult to believe, as Jay Bennett asserted in his testimony before\n\nthe Butts County Superior Court, that Judge Coker would have prohibited Collier’s attorneys\n\nfrom presenting any evidence of character other than Collier’s reputation in the community for\n\ntruth and veracity. Collier did not testify in either the guilt phase or the sentencing phase of the\n\ntrial; thus, his reputation for truth and veracity was entirely irrelevant.15 Such a limitation by the\n\ntrial judge would not simply have violated Lockett, it would have been absurd. Nevertheless,\n\ngiven the conflicting accounts provided by Jay Bennett on the one hand, and Judge Coker,\n\nCampbell, and Gillenn on the other, we look to the transcript of the sentencing phase of the trial\n\nfor evidence that might shed light on what Judge Coker actually said to defense counsel off the\n\nrecord.\n\n          Collier contends that statements made by Judge Coker on the record following the\n\nprosecutor’s objection to the testimony of his third witness, Shelly Jordan – that he had “mutual\n\nrespect” for Collier – support his claim that the judge improperly limited the mitigation evidence\n\n\n\n          15\n         The indictment in this case did not charge Collier with perjury or some other false\nstatement offense as to which his reputation for truth and veracity would be relevant. The only\nstatement made by Collier that was before the jury was his confession to the crimes of murder,\naggravated assault, and armed robbery. By presenting evidence of Collier’s reputation for truth\nand veracity, Collier’s attorneys actually buttressed his confession that he committed those\ncrimes.\n\n                                                    16\n\fhis attorneys could present. The transcript reveals that Collier’s counsel began the sentencing\n\nphase by asking the first two witnesses a few brief questions about their personal history and\n\nassociation with Collier, and then about Collier’s reputation in the community for truth and\n\nveracity, whether the witness would believe Mr. Collier under oath, and little else.16 The third\n\nwitness called to the stand was Shelly Jordan. Donald Bennett began the direct examination of\n\nthe witness by asking foundational questions, apparently as a predicate to inquiring about\n\nCollier’s reputation. The following transpired:\n\n       MR. BENNETT:           What has been your association with Mr. Collier?\n       MR. JORDAN:            Well, we were always close friends, and always got along\n                              well, and had a lot of mutual respect for each other.\n       MR. BENNETT:           Do you have that respect for him now?\n       MR. CAMPBELL:          Your Honor, I object at this time, it’s not what he thinks of\n                              him.\n       THE COURT:             I believe you’ve gone a little far afield, as to his feeling for\n                              the defendant.\n       MR. CAMPBELL:          It’s whether he knows him in the community where he\n                              lives, and not what he thinks about him, but what the\n                              people in that community, it’s not what he thinks, it’s what\n                              the people in the community think.\n       THE COURT:             I think you should be a little more limited in your\n                              examination of the witnesses relative to anything in\n                              mitigation.\n       MR. BENNETT:           Is it Your Honor’s ruling that I cannot ask him his personal\n                              opinion as to what he thinks of this defendant?\n       THE COURT:             His reputation in the community.\n\n(emphasis added). In the ensuing conversation, which took place outside the presence of the jury\n\nbut on the record, Judge Coker acknowledged that there had been some discussion with counsel\n\nprior to the sentencing phase about the evidence the defense could offer. In contrast to Jay\n\n\n\n       16\n          Donald Bennett did ask the first two witnesses whether they considered Collier’s\ncharacter, generally, to be “good” or “bad,” in addition to the questions about his reputation for\ntruthfulness.\n\n                                                  17\n\fBennett’s testimony (at the habeas hearing before the Butts County Superior Court) that Judge\n\nCoker told Collier’s counsel what evidence they could present, however, Judge Coker said, “I\n\nknow what you told me you were going to do, and I felt it might be all right in a case like this.”\n\nMoreover, Judge Coker’s statements on the record belie Bennett’s statement that Judge Coker\n\nrestricted the testimony to Collier’s reputation in the community for truth and veracity and\n\nevidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Judge Coker said:\n\n       I told you that these things that [are] admissible, it’s about his reputation in the\n       community for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things\n       like that, I think that would be mitigating, but because you might have a mutual\n       admiration for him, that is not a mitigating circumstance, and I am going to rule\n       that personal thoughts of him, whether they’re good friends or buddies, it doesn’t\n       really have any bearing on the issues, that’s what I’m trying to say.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       As is apparent from this statement, Judge Coker felt that the testimony regarding the\n\nwitness’ “mutual respect” for Collier was not mitigating evidence. He repeatedly inquired of\n\nDonald Bennett as to how the evidence was mitigating, stating several times that he, personally,\n\ndid not think that the evidence was relevant. In addition, Judge Coker asked how the proffered\n\ntestimony was in “mitigation or extenuation of punishment,” not of the crime itself. Although\n\nthere are indications in the sentencing phase transcript that Judge Coker felt that he was\n\ngenerally bound by the rules of evidence (in fact, he admitted as much during his deposition in\n\nthe state habeas proceeding), there are ample indications that Judge Coker was willing to accept\n\nevidence that would not be admissible under a strict application of the rules of evidence.\n\n       Finally, we note that Donald Bennett asked Judge Coker whether he could ask other\n\nwitnesses the question he had put to Shelly Jordan without being “criticized” by the court. Judge\n\nCoker, as he testified was his practice, responded: “I think you’ll need to ask the question before\n\n                                                18\n\fI make a determination as to whether it’s in mitigation or not, whether it complies with the rules\n\nof evidence.” Bennett did not ask the question again, nor did he make a proffer of any testimony\n\nhe thought Judge Coker had excluded during the off-the-record chambers conference held before\n\nthe sentencing phase commenced. This is not a surprising result, given that Judge Coker did not\n\nlimit or exclude any of the mitigation evidence, other than Shelly Jordan’s statement that he had\n\n“mutual respect” for Collier, that the defense team endeavored to bring before the jury. If Judge\n\nCoker had limited the presentation of mitigating evidence in the way Bennett claims, he likely\n\nwould have excluded other evidence offered by the defense during the sentencing phase; that he\n\ndid not exclude other evidence during the sentencing phase suggests that no such limitations\n\nwere placed on the defense during the pre-sentencing phase conference.\n\n\n\n                                                3.\n\n       We conclude that the record does not support Collier’s claim that the trial court\n\nimproperly limited the scope of the evidence the defense team could offer in mitigation during\n\nthe sentencing phase of the trial. Although the record suggests that defense counsel may have\n\nbeen confused about the extent of the testimony the court would allow them to elicit from their\n\nwitnesses, and that the court may have had a more narrow view than Lockett embraced\n\nconcerning the sort of evidence that could appropriately be admitted during the sentencing phase\n\nof a capital case, the evidence does not support Jay Bennett’s position that Judge Coker told the\n\ndefense team that all he would allow would be testimony of Collier’s reputation in the\n\ncommunity for truth and veracity and evidence of acts mitigating the crime itself. As noted\n\nabove, the only evidence Judge Coker excluded was Shelly Jordan’s statement that he had\n\n\n                                                19\n\f“mutual respect” for Collier – testimony which, although largely irrelevant, arguably should\n\nhave been admitted given the broad latitude accorded to capital defendants to present mitigation\n\nevidence. Furthermore, Judge Coker’s on-the-record statements as to the evidence that, in his\n\nview, would constitute mitigating evidence seriously undermines Jay Bennett’s claim that the\n\nonly evidence that could be introduced was testimony of Collier’s reputation for truth and\n\nveracity and evidence in mitigation of the crime itself. Collier’s Lockett claim accordingly fails.\n\n\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       Collier claims, alternatively, that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance\n\nof counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. First, Collier contends that his attorneys were\n\nineffective because their investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase was deficient; they\n\nfailed to interview and present testimony from numerous close personal friends and relatives\n\nwho could have provided persuasive mitigating evidence, and they failed to explore and present\n\nreadily available expert opinion evidence regarding his diabetes and diffuse organic brain\n\ndamage. Second, Collier contends that counsels’ actual presentation at the sentencing phase of\n\ntrial was ineffective in that they failed to elicit, from the witnesses who did testify, anecdotal\n\nevidence regarding his personal history, diabetic condition, and specific circumstances bearing\n\non the robberies and murder that would have effectively foreclosed the death sentence. Collier\n\ncontends that his attorneys also were ineffective because they failed to object on the record to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fcourt’s perceived (by them) limitation of mitigation evidence and failed to make an offer of\n\nproof as to what his witnesses would have said had they been permitted to testify.17\n\n\n\n                                                 1.\n\n       The first time Collier alleged that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nduring the sentencing phase was in his first state habeas petition. At that time, Collier was still\n\nbeing represented by his defense team. Not surprisingly, then, the claim was not premised upon\n\nvolitional ineffectiveness of trial counsel, but rather upon the same allegations that underpinned\n\nhis Lockett claim – that Judge Coker rendered counsel ineffective when he precluded counsel in\n\nan off-the-record ruling from presenting any substantial mitigating evidence. As it did with\n\nCollier’s Lockett claim, the state habeas court concluded that Collier had not carried his burden\n\nof proof on this ineffective assistance claim. Collier, still represented by his defense team, see\n\nsupra note 9, presented the same claim in his second federal habeas petition, but the petition was\n\ndismissed because Collier had not exhausted his state remedies with respect to all of his claims.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n           In a residual clause in his brief encompassing all of the claims that he presented to the\ndistrict court but, due to space limitation, he was unable to include in his brief, Collier\nincorporated several other grounds for his ineffective assistance claim. To the extent those\ngrounds relate to counsels’ alleged ineffectiveness during the guilt phase of the trial, we believe\nthat the district court properly disposed of them. Our finding that Collier has not demonstrated\nthat his counsel were ineffective in the guilt phase does not affect our examination of their\nperformance in the sentencing phase. We evaluate the attorneys’ performances during each\n“discreet portion[] of a trial without regard to the attorney[s’] performance[s] at other points\nduring the trial.” Horton v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566779\"><a href=\"/opinion/566779/jimmy-lee-horton-v-walter-zant-warden-georgia-diagnostic-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1461 (11th Cir. 1991).\n         With respect to the additional examples of ineffective assistance in the sentencing phase\nthat Collier presented in this “catch-all” residual clause, we need not consider them given our\nholding that counsel were ineffective in the sentencing phase.\n\n                                                 21\n\f       Collier parted ways with his defense team before filing his second state habeas petition,\n\nthus paving the way for new counsel to claim that Collier’s defense counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance in the sentencing phase of his trial. The petition alleged that counsel were ineffective\n\nfor failing to present “mitigating evidence that would have convinced the jury that Petitioner was\n\nnot ‘some huge, black man,’ as the prosecuting attorney frequently referred to Petitioner, with an\n\nevil and malicious heart that deserved to die.” According to the petition, a wealth of evidence\n\nwas available to demonstrate that Collier was a good family man, an upstanding public citizen\n\nwilling to risk his own injury to help others, and that he was a diabetic who had trouble\n\ncontrolling his behavior when he was not properly medicated. The state habeas court concluded\n\nthat the doctrine of res judicata precluded it from considering Collier’s claim since the claim had\n\nbeen raised in his first state habeas petition. The court concluded, alternatively, that Collier had\n\nwaived any claim of ineffective assistance that he had not raised in his first state habeas petition.\n\n       In Collier’s third federal habeas petition, he raised both claims of ineffective assistance:\n\n(1) that the trial court’s off-the-record-evidentiary ruling had rendered counsel ineffective; and\n\n(2) that counsel were independently ineffective for not objecting on the record to that ruling and\n\nfor failing to present efficacious mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the petition\n\nwithout prejudice because Collier had not exhausted all of his state law claims. In his third and\n\nlast state habeas petition, Collier again alleged that his attorneys’ performance was ineffective,\n\ncalling the court’s attention to two aspects of counsels’ performance that were deficient. The\n\ncourt found that both had been raised – albeit in different forms – in earlier state petitions and\n\ndisposed of, and that the earlier dispositions were res judicata.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Returning to federal court, Collier once again raised his claim of ineffective assistance in\n\nhis fourth habeas petition – the petition under review. The respondent contends that Collier\n\nprocedurally defaulted his claim because he did not assert it until his second state habeas\n\npetition. The district court agreed with respondent and applied the “cause and prejudice” test to\n\ndetermine whether Collier’s failure to follow the applicable state procedural rules precluded his\n\nclaim.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under Strickland, a person asserting a claim of\n\nineffective assistance must satisfy a two prong test:\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f                 First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was\n                 deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so\n                 serious that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”\n                 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the\n                 defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n                 defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so\n                 serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose\n                 result is reliable.\n\nId. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. In a capital case, this two part test applies to claims of ineffective\n\nassistance during the sentencing phase as well as the guilt phase of the trial, because a “capital\n\nsentencing proceeding . . . is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence\n\nof standards for decision . . . that counsel’s role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel’s role\n\nat trial – to ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the\n\nstandards governing decision.” Id. at 686-87, 104 S. Ct. at 2064 (citations omitted).\n\n        In subpart i, we examine Collier’s claims of ineffective assistance to determine whether\n\nhe has satisfied the performance prong of the Strickland test. In subpart ii, we determine\n\nwhether Collier has demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the acts and omissions of\n\nhis attorneys.\n\n\n\n                                                   i.\n\n        In order to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel were ineffective,\n\nCollier must demonstrate that their “representation fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness.” Id. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. The performance inquiry thus seeks to\n\ndetermine whether, under “prevailing professional norms,” counsel’s “assistance was reasonable\n\nconsidering all the circumstances.” Id., 104 S. Ct. at 2065. In evaluating Collier’s ineffective\n\nassistance claim, we must give great deference to counsels’ choice of strategy and execution.

With these principles in mind, we first examine\n\ncounsels’ investigation in preparation for the sentencing phase, and then their presentation of\n\nmitigating evidence before the jury.\n\n\n\n                                                 a.\n\n       Collier raises two distinct claims of ineffective assistance based on his counsels’ failure\n\nto investigate more fully his personal history as well as his medical and mental condition at the\n\ntime of the crimes. First, he contends that his attorneys failed to interview close relatives and\n\nfriends who could have provided an abundance of information regarding his childhood,\n\neconomic circumstances surrounding his upbringing, social environment in his hometown,\n\ndiabetic condition as well as attendant physical and emotional problems, and specific events in\n\nhis life that would have mitigated the sentence imposed by the jury. He also argues that counsel\n\nfailed to elicit significant mitigating evidence about Collier’s background and character from the\n\nwitnesses that were called at sentencing. Second, Collier claims that his attorneys failed to\n\npursue expert opinion testimony relating to his diabetes and to “diffuse organic brain damage.”\n\nAccording to Collier, such testimony should have been proffered during the sentencing phase to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fshow his reduced capacity to conform his behavior to the law, even if such testimony could not\n\nsupport a legal defense to the crimes themselves.19\n\n       With regard to Collier’s claim that counsel failed to interview a number of close relatives\n\nand friends of Collier that could have provided additional evidence to be used in the sentencing\n\nphase of his trial, the district court found that counsels’ failure to pursue those witnesses’\n\ntestimony was the direct result of a conscious tactical decision. “The question of whether a\n\ndecision by counsel was a tactical one is a question of fact.” Bolender, 16 F.3d at 1558 n.12\n\n(citing Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462). Whether the tactic was reasonable, however, is a question of\n\nlaw and is reviewed de novo. See Horton, 941 F.2d at 1462. In assessing the reasonableness of\n\nthe tactic, we consider “all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to\n\ncounsel’s judgments.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.\n\n       Jay Bennett testified that the defense team thought that if they “could bring out just\n\nexactly what the so-called better class of the community over in Jasper and South Pittsburgh\n\nthought about [Collier], well, that surely the jury would give some consideration to that.”\n\nCollier’s lead defense attorney, Donald Bennett, was from the largely rural area in which the trial\n\nwas held, and was familiar with the attitudes of the local citizenry. He was well-positioned,\n\ntherefore, to determine what testimony would be most well-received by the jury. Bennett\n\nbelieved that the jury would be able to relate to witnesses representing the “governing part of the\n\ncity.” In addition, counsel thought they were limited in the number of witnesses they could\n\n\n\n       19\n         Given our holding that defense counsel were ineffective in failing to elicit more\ntestimony regarding Collier’s upbringing and his mental and physical ailments, it is not\nnecessary for us to determine whether counsel were also ineffective for failing to pursue expert\ntestimony regarding Collier’s diabetic condition or his “diffuse organic brain damage.”\n\n                                                  27\n\fpresent; the out-of-state witnesses from Collier’s hometown in Tennessee had to be subpoenaed,\n\ncourt orders for their appearance had to be obtained, and witness fees had to be tendered.\n\nDonald Bennett traveled to South Pittsburgh and Jasper and interviewed quite a few potential\n\nwitnesses, including Collier’s wife. From those he selected fourteen to subpoena for trial, ten of\n\nwhom were called to testify. They included Collier’s wife, a lifelong friend, people from South\n\nPittsburgh for or with whom Collier had worked and had known for twenty years or more, the\n\nprincipal of Collier’s high school, a member of the South Pittsburgh City Commission, and a\n\nfriend of Collier’s father’s who had known Collier since he was a child.\n\n       As the district court noted, the witnesses whom counsel selected to testify possessed\n\nmuch of the information about Collier’s past and character that Collier now contends should\n\nhave been presented to the jury.20 Although we might think that it would have been more\n\nprudent for Collier’s attorneys to investigate other possible avenues for obtaining information\n\nabout Collier’s character and background, including Collier’s relatives and close friends, “in\n\n\n       20\n          The witnesses whom counsel called to the stand could have testified that Collier’s\nmother died when he was an infant, and that while his father left him in the care of his aunt and\nuncle to raise, he kept Collier’s older brother, and later remarried and had three more children.\nThey could have testified about Collier’s upbringing as a poor black child in a segregated\nsouthern town and about his gentle disposition despite his large stature; that Collier worked from\nan early age to help support himself and his aunt and uncle; that he persevered in school despite\nbeing a slow learner, becoming a football star in high school and then seeing his career end due\nto an injury during his senior year; and that he moved to Seattle after a stint in the army, and then\nreturned to South Pittsburgh to take care of the aunt who had raised him while she was dying of\ncancer. The witnesses could have testified that Collier started a family upon his return to South\nPittsburgh; that he was a devoted father and husband; that he worked hard to provide for his\nfamily; and that, about a month before he committed the crimes in this case, he lost his job with\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority and was nearly out of money when he committed them. At least\none witness, in addition to Collier’s wife, could have testified about Collier’s heroic attempt to\nsave the life of a motorist trapped in a car that had veered off a bridge into a creek. Finally,\nseveral witnesses, and especially Collier’s wife, could have testified that Collier was diabetic and\nthat he was moody and irrational when he had either not taken his insulin or missed a meal.\n\n                                                 28\n\fconsidering claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, ‘[w]e address not what is prudent or\n\nappropriate, but only what is constitutionally compelled.’” Burger v.

Considering all of the\n\ncircumstances from the position of Collier’s counsel at the time of their conduct, see Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066, we cannot conclude that counsel were ineffective for failing\n\nto interview additional potential witnesses in preparation for the sentencing phase.\n\n\n\n                                                 b.\n\n       We next evaluate counsels’ performance during the actual sentencing phase of the trial.\n\nJay Bennett testified that the defense team “knew from the start that the whole case was going to\n\nride on the sentencing phase.” The team’s conclusion is not surprising considering that Collier\n\nhad been tied clearly to the crimes by eyewitness accounts, had given a full confession to\n\nauthorities, and seemed to be of reasonable mental health. In fact, counsel considered having\n\nCollier plead guilty and then proceeding directly to the sentencing phase; William Campbell\n\ntestified that Collier’s defense team repeatedly asked Judge Coker to accept a plea of guilty in\n\nexchange for a life sentence. In short, Collier’s attorneys intended to focus their efforts on\n\npresenting evidence that would mitigate Collier’s sentence.\n\n       Counsels’ intention of presenting a strong case in mitigation stands in stark contrast to\n\nthe presentation that actually took place. After briefly summarizing the testimony that counsel\n\nadduced from Collier’s ten mitigation witnesses, we then analyze whether counsels’ performance\n\nfell below the objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. As noted\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fsupra, Collier based his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on two alternative theories: (1)\n\nthat his attorneys’ conduct was constitutionally deficient, or (2) that counsels’ performance was\n\nrendered ineffective by Judge Coker’s ruling limiting the mitigating evidence counsel could\n\npresent. The second theory, the Lockett claim, fails for the reasons stated in subpart A, supra.\n\nAs for Collier’s first theory, we conclude that counsels’ performance did not comport with the\n\nstandards of the profession and was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances; hence,\n\nthe performance constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       The sentencing phase began at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night.21 The defense team called ten\n\nwitnesses to the stand. Despite their acknowledgment that the sentencing phase was the most\n\nimportant part of the trial, their examination of the witnesses was minimal. Counsel sought to\n\nelicit very little relevant evidence about Collier’s character. In fact, with respect to a number of\n\nwitnesses, counsel sought only their opinion of Collier’s reputation for truth and veracity – a\n\nmatter wholly irrelevant to the issue before the jury.22 Furthermore, even when counsel departed\n\n\n       21\n           The District Attorney, William Campbell, testified in the habeas hearing in the Butts\nCounty Superior Court that neither party objected to beginning the sentencing phase at that hour,\nalthough both he and Donald Bennett were tired. They did not object because the two men\nstruck a deal; Campbell’s assistant, Craig Gillenn, would make the State’s closing argument to\nthe jury, and Bennett’s assistant, James Secord, would present Collier’s argument.\n       22\n          We note that Judge Coker actually prompted Donald Bennett to ask other questions of\nCollier’s witnesses; the judge reminded Bennett of his earlier advice – that Collier’s reputation\n“for being industrious, for working, or supporting his family, or things like that” would be\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Despite Judge Coker’s prompting, and his admonition at the\nconclusion of the colloquy over witness Shelly Jordan’s “mutual respect” testimony, that Bennett\nwould need to ask questions before the court could rule on the admissibility of the testimony\nsuch questions would elicit, Bennett’s direct examination of subsequent defense witnesses failed\nto explore in any significant way the witnesses’ knowledge of Collier. Bennett raced through the\nremaining witnesses, eliciting very little in the way of mitigating evidence from any of them, and\nnot once making a proffer of additional evidence in response to what he perceived to be an\nadverse exclusionary ruling by the court.\n\n                                                 30\n\ffrom the truth-and-veracity line of questioning, the testimony elicited was of a nature that could\n\nnot reasonably have aided the jury in its sentence determination.\n\n       For instance, Collier’s eighth witness was his wife, Mary Collier. After establishing that\n\nCollier and Mary had been married five years and had two children, both boys, ages three and\n\nfive, the remainder of her direct examination consisted of the following:\n\n       MR. BENNETT:            And since you have been married, has Robert supported his\n                               family?\n       MRS. COLLIER:           Yes, he has.\n       MR. BENNETT:            Has he been a hard worker?\n       MRS. COLLIER:           Yes, sir.\n       MR. BENNETT:            I believe that’s all I need to ask her.\n\nOn cross-examination, the prosecution had Mary Collier testify that she received $70 from\n\nCollier on the day of the crimes, money that she now knew he had stolen from the floral shop.\n\nOn re-direct examination, Donald Bennett established that she was not aware of the crimes when\n\nshe accepted the money.\n\n       Counsel elicited little more mitigation testimony of substance from the other nine\n\nwitnesses called on Collier’s behalf. After the presentation of mitigating evidence ended, the\n\ncourt declared a brief recess. Following the recess, counsel delivered their closing arguments,\n\nand the court charged the jury. The jury retired to deliberate at 9:28 p.m. At 12:05 a.m. the next\n\nmorning, the jury returned its verdict.\n\n       In analyzing this claim of ineffective counsel, we note that defense counsel did elicit\n\ntestimony that Collier had a “good” reputation, that he was generally known as a hard worker\n\nwho took care of his family, and that he had a good reputation for truth and veracity. The trial\n\ntranscript, however, does not support the proposition that counsels’ performance met the\n\nstandard of objective reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel presented no\n\n                                                31\n\fmore than a hollow shell of the testimony necessary for a “particularized consideration of\n\nrelevant aspects of the character and record of [a] convicted defendant before the imposition\n\nupon him of a sentence of death.” Woodson v. North Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). Although counsel were aware of the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion in Lockett, and recognized that the sentencing phase was the most important part of the\n\ntrial given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, they presented almost none of the readily\n\navailable evidence of Collier’s background and character that would have led the jury to eschew\n\nthe death penalty. Instead of developing an image of Collier as a human being who was\n\ngenerally a good family man and a good public citizen, who had a background of poverty but\n\nwho had worked hard as a child and as an adult to support his family and close relatives,\n\ncounsels’ presentation tended to give the impression that the witnesses knew little or nothing\n\nabout Collier. In failing to present any of the available evidence of Collier’s upbringing, his\n\ngentle disposition, his record of helping family in times of need, specific instances of his heroism\n\nand compassion, and evidence of his circumstances at the time of the crimes – including his\n\nrecent loss of his job, his poverty, and his diabetic condition – counsels’ performance brought\n\ninto question the reliability of the jury’s determination that death was the appropriate sentence.\n\nSee Woodson, 428 U.S. at 305, 96 S. Ct. at 2991 (noting the qualitative difference in the need for\n\nreliability in a jury’s determination that death is appropriate in a capital case).\n\n       Although Collier’s attorneys concede that their performance was deficient, they blame\n\nthe trial judge rather than themselves for their poor display. We find that the trial judge was not\n\nto blame for counsels’ ineffectiveness; rather, they were. In sum, counsel did not perform as\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fobjectively reasonable attorneys would have; their performance fell below the standards of the\n\nprofession and therefore their assistance at the sentencing phase of the trial was ineffective.\n\n\n\n                                                 ii.\n\n       Being satisfied that Collier has demonstrated that his attorneys’ performance at the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial fell below the standard or reasonableness required by the Sixth\n\nAmendment, we must now determine whether counsels’ inadequate performance during the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial prejudiced Collier. The Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he\n\npurpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the\n\nassistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 691-92, 104 S. Ct. at 2067. To satisfy the prejudice prong of the analysis, therefore, “[t]he\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\n\n       Collier has sufficiently demonstrated that the failure of his counsel to make an offer of\n\nproof on the record, or effectively to present at sentencing the wealth of mitigating evidence,\n\ncreates a reasonable probability that, but for their errors, he would not have received a death\n\nsentence. “The purpose of a sentencing hearing is to provide the jury with the information\n\nnecessary for it to render an individualized sentencing determination . . . [based upon] the\n\ncharacter and record of the individualized offender and the circumstances of the particular\n\noffense.” Dobbs v. Turpin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72964\"><a href=\"/opinion/72964/dobbs-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1386-87 (11th Cir. 1998) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted). The errors of Collier’s counsel in the sentencing phase frustrated that\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fpurpose; counsel presented ten separate witnesses, including Collier’s wife, whose relevant\n\ntestimony consisted almost entirely of one or two word answers to inquiries as to Collier’s\n\ngeneral reputation in the community, his reputation for truth and veracity, his reputation for hard\n\nwork, and his reputation as a man who supports his family. The testimony of Collier’s trial\n\ncounsel in his habeas corpus proceedings, as well as the affidavits of persons who either were\n\ninterviewed by trial counsel but not called to testify or who testified before the jury,\n\ndemonstrates that counsel were aware of numerous facts from Collier’s history that would have\n\nled the jury to forego the death penalty.\n\n       In evaluating the probability that Collier’s jury would have rejected the death penalty, we\n\nmust not forget to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors that would have been before\n\nthe jury in the absence of his counsels’ errors. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.\n\nThe district court held that even if defense counsel were ineffective in every way alleged in\n\nCollier’s petition, Collier would be unable to demonstrate prejudice because:\n\n       [t]he murder took place following an armed robbery; it involved a defendant who\n       wrested a police officer’s gun from him, shot one officer, and then turned and\n       killed the officer whose gun he had taken; and the murder occurred in a rural\n       community, where the murdered officer was widely known.\n\nThe first two factors listed by the district court generally represent the aggravating circumstances\n\nof Collier’s murder conviction: he killed a police officer while trying to prevent his arrest for the\n\ncommission of another felony. Although we do not underestimate the strength of these\n\naggravating factors, we believe that there is at least a reasonable probability that a jury\n\nconfronted with the stark contrast between Collier’s acts on the day of the crimes and his history\n\nwould not have voted for the death sentence. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390 (quoting Jackson v.\n\nHerring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684428\"><a href=\"/opinion/684428/patricia-ann-thomas-jackson-v-tommy-herring-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995), for the proposition that “[m]any death penalty\n\n                                                 34\n\fcases involve murders that are carefully planned, or accompanied by torture, rape, or\n\nkidnaping”). Had counsel presented the wealth of mitigating evidence that they gathered in\n\npreparation for the sentencing phase of the trial, see supra note 20, we believe there is a\n\nreasonable probability that consideration of these facts would have led the jury to a different\n\nresult. See Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1390-91 (affirming grant of the writ in case where evidence of\n\n“unfortunate upbringing” was not investigated by counsel and not presented during the\n\nsentencing phase of defendant’s trial).\n\n       On the other hand, the third factor listed by the district court – that the murder occurred\n\nin a rural community where the officer was widely known – seems to suggest that the people of\n\nthe community could not adequately put aside their anger about the crime to reach a detached\n\nand informed sentencing decision based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the\n\ncase. Although taking into account the righteous anger of the jurors at the killing of a person\n\nwell-known to them might have given the district court a more accurate idea of whether a 1978\n\nCatoosa County jury would have opted for a sentence of life imprisonment had they heard all of\n\nthe mitigating evidence, such considerations run afoul of Strickland. “The assessment of\n\nprejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,\n\nconscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.” Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2068 (emphasis added). We must therefore assume that the jurors\n\ncould put aside their passions and render a sentence based upon the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances of the case as presented to them. Under such an assumption, we believe that the\n\njury would have come to a different result.\n\n       In conclusion, we reiterate the Supreme Court’s statement in Strickland that\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the\n       proceeding whose result is being challenged. In every case the court should be\n       concerned with whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, the result of\n       the particular proceeding is unreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial\n       process that our system counts on to produce just results.\n\nId. at 696, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. By failing to present evidence of Collier’s background that would\n\nhave mitigated his sentence, Collier’s counsel precipitated a “breakdown in the adversarial\n\nprocess.” The jury was called upon to determine whether a man whom they did not know would\n\nlive or die; they were not presented with the particularized circumstances of his past and of his\n\nactions on the day of the crime that would have allowed them fairly to balance the seriousness of\n\nhis transgressions with the conditions of his life. Had they been able to do so, we believe that it\n\nis at least reasonably probable that the jury would have returned a sentence other than death.\n\n\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Robert Lewis Collier did not receive the effective\n\nassistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\n\nStates Constitution, at the sentencing phase of his trial. We therefore AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt’s denial of Collier’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his convictions,\n\nREVERSE the ruling of the district court denying Collier’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwith respect to his sentence of death, and REMAND this case, with the instruction that the\n\ndistrict court grant the writ of habeas corpus vacating Collier’s sentence of death.\n\n\n\n       AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f</pre>",
