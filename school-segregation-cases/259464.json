Richard G.

This case arises from a failed\n\nattempt by defendant-appellee HPSC, Inc. (\"HPSC\") to recover an\n\nembezzlement loss under an executive protection insurance policy\n\nissued by plaintiff-appellant Federal Insurance Co. (\"Federal\").\n\nFederal brought this declaratory judgment action against HPSC\n\nseeking rescission of the policy based on a misrepresentation made\n\nby   HPSC   in     its   2001    insurance     renewal    application.     HPSC\n\ncounterclaimed, seeking recovery under the policy and damages for\n\nunfair and deceptive trade practices.               Judgment was entered in\n\nfavor of HPSC on all claims.            Federal appeals, claiming that the\n\ndistrict court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the\n\nmateriality of HPSC's misrepresentation and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law on all claims.                     After carefully\n\nreviewing the record, we affirm.\n\n                                I.   Relevant Facts\n\n            On May 28, 2002, HPSC reported to its long-time insurer,\n\nFederal, that an officer of its asset-based lending subsidiary\n\nAmerican Commercial Finance Corp. (\"ACFC\"), Kevin Morrison, had\n\nembezzled   $4.7     million     over    the   previous   five   years.    HPSC\n\nsubmitted proof of loss to Federal on July 9, 2002, pursuant to its\n\nExecutive Protection Policy, which provided for $1,000,000 of\n\nemployee theft coverage, subject to a $25,000 deductible. With its\n\nclaim,      HPSC         included       an     investigative      report     by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"PwC report\") indicating that the theft\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\foccurred   due    to    Morrison's     unsegregated          control   over    account\n\nactivities.      The PwC report stated that Morrison \"exercised sole\n\ncontrol over the factoring [of accounts receivable] business at\n\nACFC and had full authority to disburse funds, collect payments,\n\nreconcile accounts and report financial performance.\" As a result,\n\n\"ACFC had insufficient segregation of duties in the factoring\n\noperation.\"\n\n           The investigation of HPSC's claim was assigned to Federal\n\nclaims examiner Anna MacKay.           Upon reading the PwC report, MacKay\n\nconcluded that Morrison both reconciled bank statements and signed\n\nchecks on the same ACFC accounts, which contradicted information\n\nprovided   by    HPSC    on   its    April   13,   2001      renewal     application.\n\nSpecifically,     HPSC    had    answered     \"no\"      to    Question    12   of   the\n\napplication, \"Do the employees who reconcile the monthly bank\n\nstatements also either: a. sign checks? b. handle deposits? or c.\n\nhave access to check signing machines or signature plates?\" MacKay\n\nrelated her findings up the ladder to her superiors at Federal, who\n\nproceeded on the same assumptions as MacKay.                   MacKay also engaged\n\noutside coverage counsel, who reviewed HPSC's file and issued an\n\nopinion letter.\n\n           Meanwhile,         HPSC    remained     in     contact      with    Federal\n\nregarding the status of its claim. Finally, on September 13, 2002,\n\nHPSC issued an ultimatum to Federal: If Federal did not pay the\n\nclaim, HPSC would file suit by September 20, 2002.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                        II.   Relevant Proceedings\n\n           Without    further      investigation,     Federal       responded     to\n\nHPSC's ultimatum by filing a diversity suit seeking rescission of\n\nthe policy for fraud and misrepresentation.                HPSC counterclaimed\n\nfor recovery under the policy and for damages under Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 93A for unfair and deceptive trade practices based on Federal's\n\ndelay in investigating and paying the claim.\n\n           Two weeks after the initial case management conference,\n\nHPSC informed Federal that MacKay had misread the PwC report.1                    In\n\nfact, it was not Morrison, but his subordinate, Sylvia Maguire, who\n\nreconciled   the     bank   statements       on   ACFC's    fifteen       operating\n\naccounts. Maguire did not sign checks or handle deposits, and ACFC\n\nhad no check signing machine or signature plate.                 All transactions\n\non these fifteen accounts were accomplished through wire transfers.\n\nThe only account for which Morrison both reconciled statements and\n\nsigned checks was an imprest petty cash account, which was capped\n\nat $10,000 and could only be replenished each month after HPSC\n\nreviewed ACFC's disbursements.\n\n           Federal then shifted its theory of the case, relying on\n\nMorrison's   authority      over   all    sixteen   of     the    ACFC    accounts.\n\nFederal   also   contended      that     Morrison's      authority       over   wire\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The conversation between the parties' attorneys was memorialized\nin a letter dated February 6, 2003.\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftransfers was the equivalent of signing checks for the purposes of\n\nQuestion 12 on the renewal application.\n\n              Both sides filed cross motions for summary judgment. The\n\ndistrict court denied both motions, concluding that HPSC's response\n\nto Question 12 was truthful as to the fifteen operating accounts,\n\ngiven that the question did not ask about an employee's unexercised\n\nauthority or about wire transfer authority.                 The district court\n\nfound   that    the    only    misrepresentation    made    by    HPSC   involved\n\nMorrison's control over the petty cash account,2 but that given the\n\nrelatively small size of that account compared to the fifteen\n\noperating accounts, the materiality of the misrepresentation was a\n\nquestion of fact for the jury.           The district judge noted, however,\n\nthat if he \"were the factfinder, [he] would most likely agree that\n\nthe misrepresentation . . . [was] a material one.\"\n\n              Prior to trial, Federal moved in limine to exclude any\n\nevidence regarding Federal's past underwriting practices on the\n\nbasis that such evidence was irrelevant to the materiality of\n\nHPSC's misrepresentation.         The district court denied the motions.\n\n              At trial, Federal's underwriter, Yalonda Mason, testified\n\nthat had she known the truth about Morrison's unsegregated duties,\n\nshe   still    would    have   written    the   policy,    but    with   a   larger\n\ndeductible     or     higher   premium   because   of     the    increased   risk.\n\n\n2\n   Outside auditors had alerted HPSC to Morrison's unsegregated\nduties on March 27, 2001 -- more than two weeks before HPSC filed\nthe renewal application.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fFederal also called a risk management expert, Dean P. Felton, who\n\ntestified that the lack of segregation between reconciliation and\n\ncheck-writing duties increased the risk of loss from theft. Felton\n\nfurther indicated that if HPSC's answer to Question 12 had been\n\ntruthful, he would have either increased the deductible, increased\n\nthe premium, or excluded the checking account from coverage.\n\n           HPSC's expert, Michael Bracken, testified that in his\n\nopinion   the   imprest   petty   cash   account   \"did   not   present   a\n\nmaterially elevated risk of loss to HPSC or [Federal].\"           Bracken\n\nalso concluded that had HPSC answered \"yes\" to Question 12, it\n\nwould have made no difference in Federal's decision to underwrite\n\nHPSC's policy.     He explained that he had reviewed HPSC's past\n\napplications to Federal, and that Federal had not followed up on\n\nany of HPSC's past \"no\" answers or even questioned its \"yes\" answer\n\nto Question 12 in 1995.      Bracken claimed that this question was\n\nimportant and that, as an underwriter, he would have investigated\n\nan affirmative answer.\n\n           At the conclusion of the evidence, Federal moved for a\n\ndirected verdict under Rule 50(a), but the district court denied\n\nthe motion.     The district court instructed the jury that Federal\n\nwas not obligated to pay HPSC's claim if HPSC's misrepresentation\n\nwas material, meaning that if Federal had known the truth, it would\n\nhave declined to issue the policy or charged a higher rate or\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fpremium in light of the increased risk.      The jury found in favor of\n\nHPSC, concluding that its misrepresentation was not material.\n\n             The district court then held a bench trial on the chapter\n\n93A claim.    At the close of HPSC's case, Federal filed a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, which the district court denied.\n\nAfter Federal presented its case, the court found that Federal's\n\ninitial determination regarding HPSC's misrepresentation was made\n\nin good faith, but that Federal had violated two statutory duties\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, § 3(9):      Federal's decision to seek\n\nrescission without inquiring into the facts or giving HPSC a chance\n\nto respond breached its duty under subsection (d) to conduct a\n\nreasonable investigation before rejecting a claim, and its failure\n\nto make a reasonable settlement offer upon learning of its mistaken\n\nconclusion regarding Morrison's reconciliation and check-writing\n\nduties on the fifteen operating accounts violated its duty under\n\nsubsection     (f)   to   \"effectuate    prompt,   fair   and   equitable\n\nsettlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably\n\nclear.\"   The court concluded that the two statutory violations\n\nconstituted unfair business practices within the meaning of chapter\n\n93A, and that Federal's conduct after learning of its flawed\n\nassumptions was a breach of its duty of good faith, which merited\n\ndoubling the damages incurred thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                               III.      Discussion\n\n            On appeal, Federal argues that it is entitled to judgment\n\nas   a   matter   of    law   on   the    rescission    claim   because    HPSC's\n\nmisrepresentation       objectively      increased     the   risk   of   loss,   or\n\nalternatively to a new trial because the district court admitted\n\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality issue.\n\nFederal also contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law on the unfair trade practices claim because it had a\n\nreasonable, plausible basis for denying HPSC's claim, even after it\n\nlearned of its original mistaken conclusion.\n\n            A.    Preservation of the Issues\n\n            As a preliminary matter, HPSC asserts that Federal failed\n\nto preserve any issues on appeal because it did not renew its Rule\n\n50(a) motion and it did not make any evidentiary objections at\n\ntrial.\n\n                       1. Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n            It is now settled that an appellate court \"cannot review\n\nthe denial of a Rule 50(a) motion based on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence when the party appealing the verdict failed to renew its\n\nsufficiency challenge in the district court pursuant to Rule\n\n50(b).\"    Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz, 459 F.3d 144, 148 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (citing Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc.,\n\n126 S. Ct. 980, 987 (2006)).                Despite our previous case law\n\nestablishing a strict \"dearth of evidentiary support\" standard of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\freview when a party failed to comply with the strictures of Rule\n\n50, see, e.g., Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nthe   Supreme   Court   made   it   abundantly   clear   in   Unitherm   Food\n\nSystems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., that in the absence of a\n\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule\n\n50(b), we are utterly \"without power to direct the District Court\n\nto enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand,\"\n\n126 S. Ct. at 985 (quoting Cone v. W. Va. Pulp & Paper Co., 330\n\nU.S. 212, 218 (1947)).\n\n           Federal failed to renew its Rule 50(a) motion after the\n\njury's verdict, and accordingly we have no power to review the\n\ndistrict court's denial of judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nrescission claim.\n\n           The strictures of Rule 50, however, do not apply in non-\n\njury trials.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 (specifying the requirements for\n\njudgment as a matter of law in jury trials); see also Colonial Penn\n\nIns. v. Market Planners Ins. Agency Inc., 157 F.3d 1032, 1037 n.3\n\n(5th Cir. 1998) (\"In a jury trial, of course, a party must make\n\n(and renew at the trial's conclusion) a Rule 50(a) motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law in order to preserve sufficiency of the\n\nevidence for appellate review.             But nothing indicates that a\n\nsimilar rule applies to an appeal of the sufficiency of evidence to\n\nsupport findings or sufficiency of findings to support a judgment\n\nfollowing a bench trial.\" (citations omitted)).           Rather, we treat\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fmotions for judgment as a matter of law made during bench trials as\n\nmotions for judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c). See Ne.\n\nDrilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc., 243 F.3d 25, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); see also Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven, 284 F.3d 31, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).   Federal made such a motion at the close of HPSC's\n\ncase, but then proceeded to put on evidence, thus waiving its right\n\nto appeal the denial of that motion.   Ne. Drilling, Inc., 243 F.3d\n\nat 37.   \"Consequently, we treat the arguments [Federal] makes on\n\nappeal under the heading of 'motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw' simply as challenges to the factual and legal sufficiency of\n\nthe district court's determinations based on all the evidence,\"\n\nid. (emphasis omitted), challenges which Federal may raise for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, Colonial Penn Ins., 157 F.3d at 1036 (\"We see\n\nno reason why [a party], following a bench trial, cannot argue now\n\nfor the first time [on appeal] that the court's findings were\n\nclearly erroneous or that they cannot support the judgment.\"\n\n(footnote omitted)).\n\n                   2. Improper Admission of Evidence\n\n          HPSC also argues that Federal did not preserve its right\n\nto seek a new trial on the basis of improperly admitted evidence\n\nbecause it did not object to the introduction of the evidence at\n\ntrial nor file a motion for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\n\n          While Federal did not object to the introduction of any\n\nevidence at trial, it did file motions in limine before trial\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fseeking to bar evidence concerning its past underwriting practices.\n\nMotions in limine preserve evidentiary issues for appeal if the\n\ndistrict court made a final and unconditional ruling on the motion;\n\nno   further   steps,   such   as   filing   a   Rule   59(b)   motion,3    are\n\nnecessary.     Crowe v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 133 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Of course, to preserve the issue, the motion in limine\n\nmust raise the same evidentiary error raised on appeal.                    HPSC\n\nalternatively argues that Federal's pre-trial motion objected to\n\nthe introduction of evidence regarding prior applications and\n\npolicies on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to the\n\nnarrow issue at trial, \"that is, whether the misrepresentation on\n\nthe 2001 policy application regarding the petty cash account was\n\nmaterial,\" whereas on appeal Federal argues that the evidence was\n\nirrelevant because it went to the underwriter's subjective state of\n\nmind.   We fail to see the difference in Federal's arguments as\n\nframed by HPSC, given that Federal's position on appeal is that the\n\nmateriality inquiry is an objective one, rather than a subjective\n\n\n3\n   While it is true that the failure to move for a new trial\nprecludes our review of sufficiency of the evidence and\ninconsistent verdict claims, see Unitherm Food Sys., 126 S. Ct. at\n986; Torres-Arroyo v. Rullán, 436 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006), it\ndoes not affect our review of a district court's decision to admit\nor exclude evidence over a party's properly preserved objection,\nsee Torres-Arroyo, 436 F.3d at 7 (deciding the challenged\nevidentiary issue despite the appellant's failure to file a motion\nfor a new trial). Rather, if we determine that the district court\nerred in admitting evidence, the appropriate remedy would be a new\ntrial. See Sec'y of Labor v. DeSisto, 929 F.2d 789, 796 (1st Cir.\n1991). Thus, HPSC's theory that failure to file a motion for a new\ntrial precludes our review of an evidentiary ruling is flawed.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fone, hence that the underwriter's subjective state of mind is\n\nirrelevant to the issue of materiality.\n\n          B.   Evidentiary Issue\n\n          Having determined that Federal preserved the evidentiary\n\nissue, we turn to the substance of that issue.                     We review a\n\ndistrict court's ruling on the admission of evidence for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Pelletier v. Main Street Textiles, LP, 470 F.3d 48, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Federal objects to the district court's admission of\n\nevidence concerning Federal's past underwriting of HPSC's policies\n\non the ground that such evidence permits a subjective inquiry into\n\nwhat the underwriter would have done had she known the truth, which\n\nis   irrelevant    to     the   objective    standard    of    whether      the\n\nmisrepresentation       increased   the   insurer's   risk    of    loss.   We\n\ndisagree with Federal's premise.4\n\n          Federal's right to rescind HPSC's policy is governed by\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 186, which provides:\n\n          No oral or written misrepresentation or\n          warranty made in the negotiation of a policy\n          of insurance by the insured or in his behalf\n          shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid\n          the policy or prevent its attaching unless\n\n\n4\n   Federal's fundamental argument on appeal is that the district\ncourt applied the wrong standard in the case. However, Federal did\nnot object to the trial court's instructions to the jury, nor did\nit preserve its right to appeal the court's denial of judgment as\na matter of law.    Our only inquiry, therefore, is whether the\nevidence in question is relevant to the objective materiality of\nHPSC's misrepresentation.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           such misrepresentation or warranty is made\n           with actual intent to deceive, or unless the\n           matter misrepresented or made a warranty\n           increased the risk of loss.\n\nWith respect to the materiality of a misrepresentation in an\n\ninsurance application, \"[a] material fact, measured by an objective\n\nstandard, is one which would 'naturally influence the judgment of\n\n[an] underwriter in making the contract at all, or in estimating\n\nthe degree and character of the risk, or in fixing the rate of the\n\npremium.'\"   A.W. Chesterton Co. v. Mass. Insurers Insolvency Fund,\n\n838 N.E.2d 1237, 1246 (Mass. 2005) (second alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Employers' Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Vella, 321 N.E.2d 910,\n\n913 (1975)).\n\n           Thus, the materiality of a misrepresentation depends on\n\nwhat a reasonable underwriter would have done differently had she\n\nknown the truth behind the misrepresentation. See Boston Mut. Ins.\n\nCo. v. N.Y. Islanders Hockey Club, L.P., 165 F.3d 93, 97 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   There are, as a matter of common sense, a variety of ways\n\nto objectively prove what an underwriter would do in a given\n\nsituation.     The parties could offer the testimony of various\n\nunderwriters or other risk management experts as to what they would\n\nhave done in the same situation, as both sides did in this case.\n\nSee Hanover Ins. Co. v. Leeds, 674 N.E.2d 1091, 1095-96 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1997) (basing a finding of materiality on the testimony of the\n\ninsurer's underwriter). Or the parties could provide evidence of\n\nwhat   underwriters   have   in   fact   done   in   the   past   in   similar\n\n                                   -13-\n\fsituations.      Similarly, it makes sense that an insurer might wish\n\nto   establish    what   it    would    do   in    a   particular   situation    by\n\npresenting evidence of its own policies and past practices.                     See\n\nBoston Mut. Ins. Co., 165 F.3d at 97 (\"[T]he statute does not go so\n\nfar as to require proof by the insurer that it would have acted\n\ndifferently (although such proof certainly tends to establish\n\nmateriality . . . ).\") (citing Barnstable County Ins. Co. v. Gale,\n\n680 N.E.2d 42 (Mass. 1997)); TIG Ins. Co. v. Blacker, 767 N.E.2d\n\n598, 602 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (basing a finding of materiality on\n\nevidence of the insurer's own standards).\n\n           If    Federal      could    present     evidence   of    its   own   past\n\nunderwriting practices to establish materiality, it follows that\n\nHPSC could do the same to establish immateriality.                    Thus, it is\n\nclear that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of\n\nFederal's actions on past applications, including HPSC's, since\n\nsuch   evidence     provides     relevant         insight   into    how   specific\n\ninformation would influence a reasonable underwriter's decisions\n\nregarding a particular policy.\n\n           C.    Chapter 93A claim\n\n           Federal also argues that it is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on HPSC's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.\n\nAs explained above, we treat this argument as a challenge to the\n\nfactual and legal sufficiency of the district court's conclusions.\n\nFollowing a bench trial on a chapter 93A claim, we review the\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fdistrict court's legal conclusions de novo and its underlying\n\nfactual findings for clear error.          Commercial Union Ins. Co. v.\n\nSeven Provinces Ins. Co., 217 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2000).        We also\n\nreview   the   district   court's    \"evaluative   judgment[s],   [when]\n\napplying a legal standard to a particular set of facts,\" for clear\n\nerror.   Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st\n\nCir. 1990). The determination of whether certain conduct is unfair\n\nor deceptive is a question of fact, but whether that conduct rises\n\nto the level of a chapter 93A violation is a question of law.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 217 F.3d at 40.\n\n           The district court concluded that Federal violated its\n\nstatutory duties to undertake a reasonable investigation of the\n\nfacts before denying the claim and to make a settlement offer when\n\nliability has become reasonably clear, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D,\n\n§ 3(9),5 and that the violation of these duties constituted an\n\n\n5\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, § 3(9) states in relevant part:\n\n      The following are hereby defined as unfair methods of\n      competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in\n      the business of insurance:--\n      . . .\n      (9) Unfair claim settlement practices: An unfair claim\n      settlement practice shall consist of any of the following\n      acts or omissions:\n      . . .\n      (d) Refusing to pay claims without conducting a\n      reasonable investigation based upon all available\n      information;\n      . . .\n      (f) Failing to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable\n      settlements of claims in which liability has become\n      reasonably clear . . . .\n\n                                    -15-\n\funfair trade practice under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2(a)\n\n(\"Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\n\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby\n\ndeclared unlawful.\"). The district court also found that Federal's\n\nconduct was knowing or willful after February 6, 2003, when it\n\nlearned that the fundamental premise of its suit was flawed; the\n\ncourt accordingly doubled the damages incurred by HPSC after that\n\ndate.    Id. § 11 (\"If the court finds for the petitioner, recovery\n\nshall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not\n\nless than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or\n\nemployment of the method of competition or the act or practice was\n\na willful or knowing violation of said section two.\")         Federal\n\nargues that the district court's rulings are not supported by the\n\nrecord.    We disagree.\n\n                    1. Unfair Trade Practices Determination\n\n            The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has concluded\n\nthat a violation of General Laws chapter 176D, § 3, which defines\n\nunfair claim settlement practices in the insurance industry, is\n\nevidence of an unfair business practice under chapter 93A, § 2,\n\nwhich would give rise to a cause of action under chapter 93A,\n\n§ 11.6    See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 610 N.E.2d 912,\n\n\n6\n   There may be additional requirements for liability to attach,\nsuch as the requirement that a claimant suffer a loss of money or\nproperty, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11, and that the unfair or\ndeceptive conduct \"occurred primarily and substantially within the\ncommonwealth,\" id.; Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. v. Digital Equip.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f917 (Mass. 1993); see also Peterborough Oil Co. v. Great Am. Ins.\n\nCo., 397 F. Supp. 2d 230, 244 (D. Mass. 2005) (\"Unlike in the\n\ncontext of consumer plaintiffs under § 9, a violation of chapter\n\n176D is only evidence of a violation of chapter 93A, § 11.\").          The\n\nquestion for us then is whether the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that Federal breached its statutory duties to investigate\n\nand to effectuate settlement.\n\n            With respect to the duty to investigate, the record\n\nsupports the district court's determination that Federal did not\n\nconduct a reasonable investigation before filing its suit for\n\nrescission.    Specifically, the district court found that MacKay\n\nnever    confirmed   her   tentative   conclusion   regarding   Morrison's\n\nauthority over the accounts in question, and no one at Federal ever\n\nattempted to contact HPSC to obtain more information regarding the\n\napparent discrepancy between HPSC's answer to Question 12 on the\n\nrenewal application and the conclusions in the PwC report.7          Thus,\n\nother than reviewing the materials submitted with HPSC's claim, it\n\nappears that Federal did no investigation of the available facts\n\nbefore    denying    coverage.     Consequently,    the   district   court\n\n\n\nCorp., 781 N.E.2d 787, 799-800 (Mass. 2003), but none of those\nrequirements are at issue here.\n7\n   Federal also challenges the district court's factual findings\nunderlying these conclusions.     There is ample support in the\nrecord, however, to support the judge's conclusion that MacKay\nmisread the PwC report and that her mistaken perception was shared\nby her superiors.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fcorrectly concluded that Federal's failure to investigate breached\n\nits statutory duty under chapter 176D, § 3(9)(d).\n\n            The record also supports the district court's finding\n\nthat Federal breached its statutory duty to effectuate settlement.\n\nAn insurer's duty to make a settlement offer arises when \"liability\n\nhas become reasonably clear.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, § 3(9)(f).\n\nThe determination as to when liability is reasonably clear depends\n\non when \"a reasonable person, with knowledge of the relevant facts\n\nand law, would probably have concluded, for good reason, that the\n\ninsurer was liable to the plaintiff.\"   Nyer v. Winterthur Int'l,\n\n290 F.3d 456, 461 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Demeo v. State Farm Mut.\n\nAuto. Ins. Co., 649 N.E.2d 803, 804 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995)).   Here,\n\nthe district court considered liability sufficiently clear after\n\nFederal learned that Morrison did not have reconciliation and\n\ncheck-writing duties with respect to ACFC's fifteen operating\n\naccounts.   Instead of admitting its error and making a settlement\n\noffer, however, Federal changed its legal theory, and when that one\n\nfailed, Federal again shifted its position, finally settling on the\n\ntheory that HPSC's misrepresentation regarding the petty cash\n\naccount was material enough to warrant denying the claim. While we\n\nhave some doubt that a reasonable person would \"probably\" have\n\nconcluded that Federal was liable on HPSC's claim, we are not\n\nprepared to say that the court's conclusion was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f            Federal contends that it had a plausible basis for\n\ndenying coverage at all times, even after it learned that HPSC's\n\nonly misrepresentation involved the petty cash account, and that an\n\ninsurer who has a good faith, plausible basis for denying a claim\n\n\"cannot    ordinarily   be   said    to    have   committed   a   violation   of\n\n[chapter] 93A.\"       Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Offices Unlimited,\n\nInc., 645 N.E.2d 1165, 1169 (Mass. 1995).           Even if we were inclined\n\nto agree that Federal's basis for denying coverage was plausible,\n\nin that it was a \"[s]eemly or apparently valid\" legal theory,\n\nWebster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 901 (1988), the\n\ndistrict court explicitly determined, with sufficient support in\n\nthe record, as explained below, that Federal was not acting in good\n\nfaith after February 6, 2003.            The absence of good faith supports\n\nthe district court's unfair settlement practice determination, even\n\nin the face of a plausible coverage position.                     See Guity v.\n\nCommerce Ins. Co., 631 N.E.2d 75, 77-78 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (\"A\n\nplausible, reasoned legal position that may ultimately turn out to\n\nbe mistaken . . . is outside the scope of the punitive aspects of\n\nthe combined application of c. 93A and c. 176D.           An absence of good\n\nfaith     and   the   presence      of    extortionate   tactics     generally\n\ncharacterize the basis for a c. 93A-176D action based on unfair\n\nsettlement practice.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n            In sum, the district court did not clearly err in finding\n\nthat Federal failed to conduct a reasonable investigation before\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fseeking rescission and then failed to make a settlement offer once\n\nliability was reasonably clear, and thus that Federal breached its\n\nstatutory duties.    Therefore, we affirm the district court's legal\n\nconclusion that Federal violated chapter 93A by engaging in unfair\n\nclaim settlement practices as defined in chapter 176D, § 3(9). See\n\nCont'l Ins. Co. v. Bahnan, 216 F.3d 150, 157 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"We\n\nare persuaded here . . . that the court's finding that [the\n\nplaintiff] satisfied the imperatives of chapter 176D was amply\n\nsupported by competent and credible evidence.      So, too, were the\n\ncourt's fairness determinations under chapter 93A.     We need go no\n\nfurther.\")\n\n                    2. Willfulness Determination\n\n          Finally, the district court's conclusion that \"Federal's\n\nconduct . . ., while not motivated by a dishonest purpose, spite,\n\nor ill will, was after February 6, 2003, a knowing or willful\n\nbreach of its duty of good faith\" is also supported by the record.8\n\nThe district court was convinced based on the evidence before it\n\nthat Federal acted in bad faith by, among other things, racing to\n\nlitigate without knowing all the facts and then stubbornly refusing\n\nto admit its error.     Cf. id. (\"The district court, which saw and\n\nheard the witnesses, concluded that Continental had not sailed too\n\n\n\n8\n   February 6, 2003, was the date of the letter memorializing\nHPSC's revelation that MacKay had misread the PwC report and that\nFederal's assumption that Morrison had reconciled statements and\nwrote checks on all sixteen ACFC accounts was flawed.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fclose to the chapter 176D winds . . . .\"); Correa v. Hosp. S.F., 69\n\nF.3d 1184, 1194 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"To be sure, the evidence in this\n\ncase is not particularly precise.          But facts at trial, as in life,\n\ndo not always appear in black and white.                   Juries and judges\n\nfrequently must distinguish between manifold shades of gray.\").\n\nAccordingly,     the    district   court    properly     doubled   the   damages\n\nincurred after February 6, 2003.           Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse\n\nElec.   Corp.,    548     N.E.2d   182,     188   n.10    (Mass.   1990)    (\"In\n\ncircumstances of knowing and wilful violation of c. 93A or of bad-\n\nfaith refusal to settle, a plaintiff also may be entitled to double\n\nor treble damages under c. 93A itself.\")\n\n                       3. Attorneys' Fees\n\n          HPSC asks that we order Federal to pay attorneys' fees\n\nincurred by HPSC in defending this appeal. HPSC is indeed entitled\n\nto \"reasonable attorney's fees for [its] successful defense of\n\n[its] award of attorney's fees and costs under [chapter] 93A.\"\n\nTwin Fires Inv., LLC v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 837\n\nN.E.2d 1121, 1140 (Mass. 2005).             Federal did not challenge the\n\ndistrict court's calculation of attorneys' fees and costs below,\n\nand therefore we will not disturb that ruling.             With regard to the\n\ncalculation on appeal, however, we award only those attorneys' fees\n\nincurred in defending the chapter 93A claim.              See Incase, Inc. v.\n\nTimex Corp., 421 F. Supp. 2d 226, 244 (D. Mass. 2006) (\"[When t]he\n\nchapter 93A claim was brought together with a number of other\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fclaims[,] . . . an award of fees and costs under chapter 93A should\n\ngenerally include an amount only for those fees and costs that were\n\nincurred in connection with the chapter 93A portion of the case.\")\n\nThe factual basis of the chapter 93A claim is sufficiently distinct\n\nfrom that of the breach of contract claim that HPSC and its\n\nattorneys should be able to differentiate the time spent on each of\n\nthe   two    claims.     See   id.   However,     to   the   extent   that   the\n\nattorneys' fees incurred in successfully defending the chapter 93A\n\nclaim cannot be excised with any certainty from those related to\n\nHPSC's breach of contract defense, HPSC is entitled to the fees\n\ncommon to both claims, since the two are based on the same core of\n\nfacts.      Id. (citing Twin Fires Inv., 837 N.E.2d at 1140).\n\n                               IV.   Conclusion\n\n             For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment in\n\nfavor of HPSC on both the rescission and the unfair trade practices\n\nclaims, as well as the doubling of damages after February 6, 2003.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f",

(\"HPSC\") to recover an embezzlement loss under an executive protection insurance policy issued by plaintiff-appellant Federal Insurance Co. (\"Federal\"). Federal brought this declaratory judgment action against HPSC seeking rescission of the policy based on a misrepresentation made by HPSC in its 2001 insurance renewal application. HPSC counterclaimed, seeking recovery under the policy and damages for unfair and deceptive trade practices. Judgment was entered in favor of HPSC on all claims. Federal appeals, claiming that the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality of HPSC's misrepresentation and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Relevant Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 2002, HPSC reported to its long-time insurer, Federal, that an officer of its asset-based lending subsidiary American Commercial Finance Corp. (\"ACFC\"), Kevin Morrison, had embezzled $4.7 million over the previous five years. HPSC submitted proof of loss to Federal on July 9, 2002, pursuant to its Executive Protection Policy, which provided for $1,000,000 of employee theft coverage, subject to a $25,000 deductible. With its claim, HPSC included an investigative report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"PwC report\") indicating that the theft occurred due to Morrison's unsegregated control over account activities. The PwC report stated that Morrison \"exercised sole control over the factoring [of accounts receivable] business at ACFC and had full authority to disburse funds, collect payments, reconcile accounts and report financial performance.\" As a result, \"ACFC had insufficient segregation of duties in the factoring operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation of HPSC's claim was assigned to Federal claims examiner Anna MacKay. Upon reading the PwC report, MacKay concluded that Morrison both reconciled bank statements and signed checks on the same ACFC accounts, which contradicted information provided by HPSC on its April 13, 2001 renewal application. Specifically, HPSC had answered \"no\" to Question 12 of the application, \"Do the employees who reconcile the monthly bank statements also either: a. sign checks? b. handle deposits? or c. have access to check signing machines or signature plates?\" MacKay related her findings up the ladder to her superiors at Federal, who proceeded on the same assumptions as MacKay. MacKay also engaged outside coverage counsel, who reviewed HPSC's file and issued an opinion letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, HPSC remained in contact with Federal regarding the status of its claim. Finally, on September 13, 2002, HPSC issued an ultimatum to Federal: If Federal did not pay the claim, HPSC would file suit by September 20, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Relevant Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without further investigation, Federal responded to HPSC's ultimatum by filing a diversity suit seeking rescission of the policy for fraud and misrepresentation. HPSC counterclaimed for recovery under the policy and for damages under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A for unfair and deceptive trade practices based on Federal's delay in investigating and paying the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after the initial case management conference, HPSC informed Federal that MacKay had misread the PwC report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In fact, it was not Morrison, but his subordinate, Sylvia Maguire, who reconciled the bank statements on ACFC's fifteen operating accounts. Maguire did not sign checks or handle deposits, and ACFC had no check signing machine or signature plate. All transactions on these fifteen accounts were accomplished through wire transfers. The only account for which Morrison both reconciled statements and signed checks was an imprest petty cash account, which was capped at $10,000 and could only be replenished each month after HPSC reviewed ACFC's disbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal then shifted its theory of the case, relying on Morrison's authority over all sixteen of the ACFC accounts. Federal also contended that Morrison's authority over wire transfers was the equivalent of signing checks for the purposes of Question 12 on the renewal application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides filed cross motions for summary judgment. The district court denied both motions, concluding that HPSC's response to Question 12 was truthful as to the fifteen operating accounts, given that the question did not ask about an employee's unexercised authority or about wire transfer authority. The district court found that the only misrepresentation made by HPSC involved Morrison's control over the petty cash account,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but that given the relatively small size of that account compared to the fifteen operating accounts, the materiality of the misrepresentation was a question of fact for the jury. The district judge noted, however, that if he \"were the factfinder, [he] would most likely agree that the misrepresentation ...

Federal also called a risk management expert, Dean P. Felton, who testified that the lack of segregation between reconciliation and check-writing duties increased the risk of loss from theft. Felton further indicated that if HPSC's answer to Question 12 had been truthful, he would have either increased the deductible, increased the premium, or excluded the checking account from coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HPSC's expert, Michael Bracken, testified that in his opinion the imprest petty cash account \"did not present a materially elevated risk of loss to HPSC or [Federal].\" Bracken also concluded that had HPSC answered \"yes\" to Question 12, it would have made no difference in Federal's decision to underwrite HPSC's policy. He explained that he had reviewed HPSC's past applications to Federal, and that Federal had not followed up on any of HPSC's past \"no\" answers or even questioned its \"yes\" answer to Question 12 in 1995. Bracken claimed that this question was important and that, as an underwriter, he would have investigated an affirmative answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Federal moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a), but the district court denied the motion. The district court instructed the jury that Federal was not obligated to pay HPSC's claim if HPSC's misrepresentation was material, meaning that if Federal had known the truth, it would have declined to issue the policy or charged a higher rate or premium in light of the increased risk.

At the close of HPSC's case, Federal filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court denied. After Federal presented its case, the court found that Federal's initial determination regarding HPSC's misrepresentation was made in good faith, but that Federal had violated two statutory duties under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9): Federal's decision to seek rescission without inquiring into the facts or giving HPSC a chance to respond breached its duty under subsection (d) to conduct a reasonable investigation before rejecting a claim, and its failure to make a reasonable settlement offer upon learning of its mistaken conclusion regarding Morrison's reconciliation and check-writing duties on the fifteen operating accounts violated its duty under subsection (f) to \"effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\" The court concluded that the two statutory violations constituted unfair business practices within the meaning of chapter 93A, and that Federal's conduct after learning of its flawed assumptions was a breach of its duty of good faith, which merited doubling the damages incurred thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Federal argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the rescission claim because HPSC's misrepresentation objectively increased the risk of loss, or alternatively to a new trial because the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality issue. Federal also contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the unfair trade practices claim because it had a reasonable, plausible basis for denying HPSC's claim, even after it learned of its original mistaken conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Preservation of the Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, HPSC asserts that Federal failed to preserve any issues on appeal because it did not renew its Rule 50(a) motion and it did not make any evidentiary objections at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Judgment as a Matter of Law</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is now settled that an appellate court \"cannot review the denial of a Rule 50(a) motion based on the sufficiency of the evidence when the party appealing the verdict failed to renew its sufficiency challenge in the district court pursuant to Rule 50(b).\" <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n v.

Despite our previous case law establishing a strict \"dearth of evidentiary support\" standard of review when a party failed to comply with the strictures of Rule 50, <i>see, e.g., Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> 424 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir.2005), the Supreme Court made it abundantly clear in <i>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc.,</i> that in the absence of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), we are utterly \"without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand,\" 126 S.Ct. at 985 (quoting <i>Cone v. W. Va. Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</i> 330 U.S. 212, 218, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal failed to renew its Rule 50(a) motion after the jury's verdict, and accordingly we have no power to review the district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law on the rescission claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strictures of Rule 50, however, do not apply in non-jury trials. Fed. R.Civ.P. 50 (specifying the requirements for judgment as a matter of law <i>in jury trials</i>); <i>see also Colonial Penn Ins. v. Market Planners Ins. Agency Inc.,</i> 157 F.3d 1032, 1037 n. 3 (5th Cir.1998) (\"In a jury trial, of course, a party must make (and renew at the trial's conclusion) a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law in order to preserve sufficiency of the evidence for appellate review. But nothing indicates that a similar rule applies to an appeal of the sufficiency of evidence to support findings or sufficiency of findings to support a judgment following a bench trial.\" (citations omitted)). Rather, we treat motions for judgment as a matter of law made during bench trials as motions for judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c). <i>See Ne. Drilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc.,</i> 243 F.3d 25, 37 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven,</i> 284 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.2002). Federal made such a motion at the close of HPSC's case, but then proceeded to put on evidence, thus waiving its right to appeal the denial of that motion. <i>Ne. Drilling, Inc.,</i> 243 F.3d at 37. \"Consequently, we treat the arguments [Federal] makes on appeal under the heading of `motion for judgment as a matter of law' simply as challenges to the factual and legal sufficiency of the district court's determinations based on all the evidence,\" <i>id.</i> (emphasis omitted), challenges which Federal may raise for the first time on appeal, <i>Colonial Penn Ins.,</i> 157 F.3d at 1036 (\"We see no reason why [a party], following a bench trial, cannot argue now for the first time [on appeal] that the court's findings were clearly erroneous or that they cannot support the judgment.\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Improper Admission of Evidence</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HPSC also argues that Federal did not preserve its right to seek a new trial on the basis of improperly admitted evidence because it did not object to the introduction of the evidence at trial nor file a motion for a new trial under Rule 59(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Federal did not object to the introduction of any evidence at trial, it did file motions <i>in limine</i> before trial seeking to bar evidence concerning its past underwriting practices. Motions <i>in limine</i> preserve evidentiary issues for appeal if the district court made a final and unconditional ruling on the motion; no further steps, such as filing a Rule 59(b) motion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are necessary. <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 334 F.3d 124, 133 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, to preserve the issue, the motion <i>in limine</i> must raise the same evidentiary error raised on appeal. HPSC alternatively argues that Federal's pre-trial motion objected to the introduction of evidence regarding prior applications and policies on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to the narrow issue at trial, \"that is, whether the misrepresentation on the 2001 policy application regarding the petty cash account was material,\" whereas on appeal Federal argues that the evidence was irrelevant because it went to the underwriter's subjective state of mind. We fail to see the difference in Federal's arguments as framed by HPSC, given that Federal's position on appeal is that the materiality inquiry is an objective one, rather than a subjective one, hence that the underwriter's subjective state of mind is irrelevant to the issue of materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidentiary Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Federal preserved the evidentiary issue, we turn to the substance of that issue. We review a district court's ruling on the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>Pelletier v. Main Street Textiles, LP,</i> 470 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal objects to the district court's admission of evidence concerning Federal's past underwriting of HPSC's policies on the ground that such evidence permits a subjective inquiry into what the underwriter would have done had she known the truth, which is irrelevant to the objective standard of whether the misrepresentation increased the insurer's risk of loss. We disagree with Federal's premise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal's right to rescind HPSC's policy is governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 186, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the materiality of a misrepresentation in an insurance application, \"[a] material fact, measured by an objective standard, is one which would `naturally influence the judgment of [an] underwriter in making the contract at all, or in estimating the degree and character of the risk, or in fixing the rate of the premium.'\" <i>A. W. Chesterton Co. v. Mass. Insurers Insolvency Fund,</i> 445 Mass. 502, 838 N.E.2d 1237, 1246 (2005) (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>Employers' Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Vella,</i> 366 Mass. 651, 321 N.E.2d 910, 913 (1975)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the materiality of a misrepresentation depends on what a reasonable underwriter would have done differently had she known the truth behind the misrepresentation. <i>See Boston Mut. Ins. Co. v. N.Y. Islanders Hockey Club, L.P.,</i> 165 F.3d 93, 97 (1st Cir.1999). There are, as a matter of common sense, a variety of ways to objectively prove what an underwriter would do in a given situation. The parties could offer the testimony of various underwriters or other risk management experts as to what they would have done in the same situation, as both sides did in this case. <i>See Hanover Ins. Co. v. Leeds,</i> 42 Mass.App.Ct. 54, 674 N.E.2d 1091, 1095-96 (1997) (basing a finding of materiality on the testimony of the insurer's underwriter). Or the parties could provide evidence of what underwriters have in fact done in the past in similar situations. Similarly, it makes sense that an insurer might wish to establish what it would do in a particular situation by presenting evidence of its own policies and past practices. <i>See Boston Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 165 F.3d at 97 (\"[T]he statute does not go so far as to require proof by the insurer that it <i>would</i> have acted differently (although such proof certainly tends to establish materiality . . .).\") (citing <i>Barnstable County Ins. Co. v. Gale,</i> 425 Mass. 126, 680 N.E.2d 42 (1997)); <i>TIG Ins. Co. v. Blacker,</i> 54 Mass.App.Ct. 683, 767 N.E.2d 598, 602 (2002) (basing a finding of materiality on evidence of the insurer's own standards).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Federal could present evidence of its own past underwriting practices to establish materiality, it follows that HPSC could do the same to establish immateriality. Thus, it is clear that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of Federal's actions on past applications, including HPSC's, since such evidence provides relevant insight into how specific information would influence a reasonable underwriter's decisions regarding a particular policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Chapter 93A claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal also argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on HPSC's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim. As explained above, we treat this argument as a challenge to the factual and legal sufficiency of the district court's conclusions. Following a bench trial on a chapter 93A claim, we review the district court's legal conclusions <i>de novo</i> and its underlying factual findings for clear error. <i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Seven Provinces Ins. Co.,</i> 217 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2000). We also review the district court's \"evaluative judgment[s], [when] applying a legal standard to a particular set of facts,\" for clear error. <i>Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm.,</i> 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir. 1990). The determination of whether certain conduct is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact, but whether that conduct rises to the level of a chapter 93A violation is a question of law. <i>Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> 217 F.3d at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Federal violated its statutory duties to undertake a reasonable investigation of the facts before denying the claim and to make a settlement offer when liability has become reasonably clear, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and that the violation of these duties constituted an unfair trade practice under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2(a) (\"Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\"). The district court also found that Federal's conduct was knowing or willful after February 6, 2003, when it learned that the fundamental premise of its suit was flawed; the court accordingly doubled the damages incurred by HPSC after that date. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 11 (\"If the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the method of competition or the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of said section two.\") Federal argues that the district court's rulings are not supported by the record. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1. Unfair Trade Practices Determination</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that a violation of General Laws chapter 176D, &#167; 3, which defines unfair claim settlement practices in the insurance industry, is evidence of an unfair business practice under chapter 93A, &#167; 2, which would give rise to a cause of action under chapter 93A, &#167; 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 414 Mass. 747, 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (1993); <i>see also Peterborough Oil Co. v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 397 F.Supp.2d 230, 244 (D.Mass. 2005) (\"Unlike in the context of consumer plaintiffs under &#167; 9, a violation of chapter 176D is only <i>evidence</i> of a violation of chapter 93A, &#167; 11.\"). The question for us then is whether the district court correctly concluded that Federal breached its statutory duties to investigate and to effectuate settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the duty to investigate, the record supports the district court's determination that Federal did not conduct a reasonable investigation before filing its suit for rescission. Specifically, the district court found that MacKay never confirmed her tentative conclusion regarding Morrison's authority over the accounts in question, and no one at Federal ever attempted to contact HPSC to obtain more information regarding the apparent discrepancy between HPSC's answer to Question 12 on the renewal application and the conclusions in the PwC report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, other than reviewing the materials submitted with HPSC's claim, it appears that Federal did no investigation of the available facts before denying coverage. Consequently, the district court correctly concluded that Federal's failure to investigate breached its statutory duty under chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also supports the district court's finding that Federal breached its statutory duty to effectuate settlement. An insurer's duty to make a settlement offer arises when \"liability has become reasonably clear.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)(f). The determination as to when liability is reasonably clear depends on when \"a reasonable person, with knowledge of the relevant facts and law, would probably have concluded, for good reason, that the insurer was liable to the plaintiff.\" <i>Nyer v. Winterthur Int'l,</i> 290 F.3d 456, 461 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Demeo v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 38 Mass.App. Ct. 955, 649 N.E.2d 803, 804 (1995)). Here, the district court considered liability sufficiently clear after Federal learned that Morrison did not have reconciliation and check-writing duties with respect to ACFC's fifteen operating accounts. Instead of admitting its error and making a settlement offer, however, Federal changed its legal theory, and when that one failed, Federal again shifted its position, finally settling on the theory that HPSC's misrepresentation regarding the petty cash account was material enough to warrant denying the claim. While we have some doubt that a reasonable person would \"probably\" have concluded that Federal was liable on HPSC's claim, we are not prepared to say that the court's conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal contends that it had a plausible basis for denying coverage at all times, even after it learned that HPSC's only misrepresentation involved the petty cash account, and that an insurer who has a good faith, plausible basis for denying a claim \"cannot ordinarily be said to have committed a violation of [chapter] 93A.\" <i>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Offices Unlimited, Inc.,</i> 419 Mass. 462, 645 N.E.2d 1165, 1169 (1995). Even if we were inclined to agree that Federal's basis for denying coverage was plausible, in that it was a \"[s]eemly or apparently valid\" legal theory, <i>Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary</i> 901 (1988), the district court explicitly determined, with sufficient support in the record, as explained below, that Federal was not acting in good faith after February 6, 2003. The absence of good faith supports the district court's unfair settlement practice determination, even in the face of a plausible coverage position. <i>See Guity v. Commerce Ins. Co.,</i> 36 Mass.App.Ct. 339, 631 N.E.2d 75, 77-78 (1994) (\"A plausible, reasoned legal position that may ultimately turn out to be mistaken . . . is outside the scope of the punitive aspects of the combined application of c. 93A and c. 176D. An absence of good faith and the presence of extortionate tactics generally characterize the basis for a c. 93A-176D action based on unfair settlement practice.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Federal failed to conduct a reasonable investigation before seeking rescission and then failed to make a settlement offer once liability was reasonably clear, and thus that Federal breached its statutory duties. Therefore, we affirm the district court's legal conclusion that Federal violated chapter 93A by engaging in unfair claim settlement practices as defined in chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9). <i>See Cont'l Ins. Co. v. Bahnan,</i> 216 F.3d 150, 157 (1st Cir.2000) (\"We are persuaded here . . . that the court's finding that [the plaintiff] satisfied the imperatives of chapter 176D was amply supported by competent and credible evidence. So, too, were the court's fairness determinations under chapter 93A. We need go no further.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Willfulness Determination</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's conclusion that \"Federal's conduct . . ., while not motivated by a dishonest purpose, spite, or ill will, was after February 6, 2003, a knowing or willful breach of its duty of good faith\" is also supported by the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The district court was convinced based on the evidence before it that Federal acted in bad faith by, among other things, racing to litigate without knowing all the facts and then stubbornly refusing to admit its error. <i>Cf. id.</i> (\"The district court, which saw and heard the witnesses, concluded that Continental had not sailed too close to the chapter 176D winds . . . .\"); <i>Correa v. Hosp. S.F.,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1194 (1st Cir.1995) (\"To be sure, the evidence in this case is not particularly precise. But facts at trial, as in life, do not always appear in black and white. Juries and judges frequently must distinguish between manifold shades of gray.\"). Accordingly, the district court properly doubled the damages incurred after February 6, 2003. <i>Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec.

Attorneys' Fees</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HPSC asks that we order Federal to pay attorneys' fees incurred by HPSC in defending this appeal. HPSC is indeed entitled to \"reasonable attorney's fees for [its] successful defense of [its] award of attorney's fees and costs under [chapter] 93A.\" <i>Twin Fires Inv., LLC v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.,</i> 445 Mass. 411, 837 N.E.2d 1121, 1140 (2005). Federal did not challenge the district court's calculation of attorneys' fees and costs below, and therefore we will not disturb that ruling. With regard to the calculation on appeal, however, we award only those attorneys' fees incurred in defending the chapter 93A claim. <i>See Incase, Inc. v. Timex Corp.,</i> 421 F.Supp.2d 226, 244 (D.Mass.2006) (\"[When t]he chapter 93A claim was brought together with a number of other claims[,] . . . an award of fees and costs under chapter 93A should generally include an amount only for those fees and costs that were incurred in connection with the chapter 93A portion of the case.\") The factual basis of the chapter 93A claim is sufficiently distinct from that of the breach of contract claim that HPSC and its attorneys should be able to differentiate the time spent on each of the two claims. <i>See id.</i> However, to the extent that the attorneys' fees incurred in successfully defending the chapter 93A claim cannot be excised with any certainty from those related to HPSC's breach of contract defense, HPSC is entitled to the fees common to both claims, since the two are based on the same core of facts. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Twin Fires Inv.,</i> 837 N.E.2d at 1140).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

(\"HPSC\") to recover an embezzlement loss under an executive protection insurance policy issued by plaintiff-appellant Federal Insurance Co. (\"Federal\"). Federal brought this declaratory judgment action against HPSC seeking rescission of the policy based on a misrepresentation made by HPSC in its 2001 insurance renewal application. HPSC counterclaimed, seeking recovery under the policy and damages for unfair and deceptive trade practices. Judgment was entered in favor of HPSC on all claims. Federal appeals, claiming that the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality of HPSC's misrepresentation and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Relevant Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 2002, HPSC reported to its long-time insurer, Federal, that an officer of its asset-based lending subsidiary American Commercial Finance Corp. (\"ACFC\"), Kevin Morrison, had embezzled $4.7 million over the previous five years. HPSC submitted proof of loss to Federal on July 9, 2002, pursuant to its Executive Protection Policy, which provided for $1,000,000 of employee theft coverage, subject to a $25,000 deductible. With its claim, HPSC included an investigative report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"PwC report\") indicating that the theft occurred due to Morrison's unsegregated control over account activities. The PwC report stated that Morrison \"exercised sole control over the factoring [of accounts receivable] business at ACFC and had full authority to disburse funds, collect payments, reconcile accounts and report financial performance.\" As a result, \"ACFC had insufficient segregation of duties in the factoring operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation of HPSC's claim was assigned to Federal claims examiner Anna MacKay. Upon reading the PwC report, MacKay concluded that Morrison both reconciled bank statements and signed checks on the same ACFC accounts, which contradicted information provided by HPSC on its April 13, 2001 renewal application. Specifically, HPSC had answered \"no\" to Question 12 of the application, \"Do the employees who reconcile the monthly bank statements also either: a. sign checks? b. handle deposits? or c. have access to check signing machines or signature plates?\" MacKay related her findings up the ladder to her superiors at Federal, who proceeded on the same assumptions as MacKay. MacKay also engaged outside coverage counsel, who reviewed HPSC's file and issued an opinion letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, HPSC remained in contact with Federal regarding the status of its claim. Finally, on September 13, 2002, HPSC issued an ultimatum to Federal: If Federal did not pay the claim, HPSC would file suit by September 20, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Relevant Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without further investigation, Federal responded to HPSC's ultimatum by filing a diversity suit seeking rescission of the policy for fraud and misrepresentation. HPSC counterclaimed for recovery under the policy and for damages under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A for unfair and deceptive trade practices based on Federal's delay in investigating and paying the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after the initial case management conference, HPSC informed Federal that MacKay had misread the PwC report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In fact, it was not Morrison, but his subordinate, Sylvia Maguire, who reconciled the bank statements on ACFC's fifteen operating accounts. Maguire did not sign checks or handle deposits, and ACFC had no check signing machine or signature plate. All transactions on these fifteen accounts were accomplished through wire transfers. The only account for which Morrison both reconciled statements and signed checks was an imprest petty cash account, which was capped at $10,000 and could only be replenished each month after HPSC reviewed ACFC's disbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal then shifted its theory of the case, relying on Morrison's authority over all sixteen of the ACFC accounts. Federal also contended that Morrison's authority over wire transfers was the equivalent of signing checks for the purposes of Question 12 on the renewal application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides filed cross motions for summary judgment. The district court denied both motions, concluding that HPSC's response to Question 12 was truthful as to the fifteen operating accounts, given that the question did not ask about an employee's unexercised authority or about wire transfer authority. The district court found that the only misrepresentation made by HPSC involved Morrison's control over the petty cash account,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but that given the relatively small size of that account compared to the fifteen operating accounts, the materiality of the misrepresentation was a question of fact for the jury. The district judge noted, however, that if he \"were the factfinder, [he] would most likely agree that the misrepresentation ... [was] a material one.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Federal moved <i>in limine</i> to exclude any evidence regarding Federal's past underwriting practices on the basis that such evidence was irrelevant to the materiality of HPSC's misrepresentation. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Federal's underwriter, Yalonda Mason, testified that had she known the truth about Morrison's unsegregated duties, she still would have written the policy, but with a larger deductible or higher premium because of the increased risk. Federal also called a risk management expert, Dean P. Felton, who testified that the lack of segregation between reconciliation and check-writing duties increased the risk of loss from theft. Felton further indicated that if HPSC's answer to Question 12 had been truthful, he would have either increased the deductible, increased the premium, or excluded the checking account from coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HPSC's expert, Michael Bracken, testified that in his opinion the imprest petty cash account \"did not present a materially elevated risk of loss to HPSC or [Federal].\" Bracken also concluded that had HPSC answered \"yes\" to Question 12, it would have made no difference in Federal's decision to underwrite HPSC's policy. He explained that he had reviewed HPSC's past applications to Federal, and that Federal had not followed up on any of HPSC's past \"no\" answers or even questioned its \"yes\" answer to Question 12 in 1995. Bracken claimed that this question was important and that, as an underwriter, he would have investigated an affirmative answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Federal moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a), but the district court denied the motion. The district court instructed the jury that Federal was not obligated to pay HPSC's claim if HPSC's misrepresentation was material, meaning that if Federal had known the truth, it would have declined to issue the policy or charged a higher rate or premium in light of the increased risk. The jury found in favor of HPSC, concluding that its misrepresentation was not material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then held a bench trial on the chapter 93A claim. At the close of HPSC's case, Federal filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court denied. After Federal presented its case, the court found that Federal's initial determination regarding HPSC's misrepresentation was made in good faith, but that Federal had violated two statutory duties under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9): Federal's decision to seek rescission without inquiring into the facts or giving HPSC a chance to respond breached its duty under subsection (d) to conduct a reasonable investigation before rejecting a claim, and its failure to make a reasonable settlement offer upon learning of its mistaken conclusion regarding Morrison's reconciliation and check-writing duties on the fifteen operating accounts violated its duty under subsection (f) to \"effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\" The court concluded that the two statutory violations constituted unfair business practices within the meaning of chapter 93A, and that Federal's conduct after learning of its flawed assumptions was a breach of its duty of good faith, which merited doubling the damages incurred thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Federal argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the rescission claim because HPSC's misrepresentation objectively increased the risk of loss, or alternatively to a new trial because the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality issue. Federal also contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the unfair trade practices claim because it had a reasonable, plausible basis for denying HPSC's claim, even after it learned of its original mistaken conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Preservation of the Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, HPSC asserts that Federal failed to preserve any issues on appeal because it did not renew its Rule 50(a) motion and it did not make any evidentiary objections at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1.

Rather, we treat motions for judgment as a matter of law made during bench trials as motions for judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c). <i>See Ne. Drilling, Inc. v.

HPSC alternatively argues that Federal's pre-trial motion objected to the introduction of evidence regarding prior applications and policies on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to the narrow issue at trial, \"that is, whether the misrepresentation on the 2001 policy application regarding the petty cash account was material,\" whereas on appeal Federal argues that the evidence was irrelevant because it went to the underwriter's subjective state of mind. We fail to see the difference in Federal's arguments as framed by HPSC, given that Federal's position on appeal is that the materiality inquiry is an objective one, rather than a subjective one, hence that the underwriter's subjective state of mind is irrelevant to the issue of materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

There are, as a matter of common sense, a variety of ways to objectively prove what an underwriter would do in a given situation.

Or the parties could provide evidence of what underwriters have in fact done in the past in similar situations. Similarly, it makes sense that an insurer might wish to establish what it would do in a particular situation by presenting evidence of its own policies and past practices. <i>See Boston Mut. Ins.

Thus, it is clear that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of Federal's actions on past applications, including HPSC's, since such evidence provides relevant insight into how specific information would influence a reasonable underwriter's decisions regarding a particular policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

The question for us then is whether the district court correctly concluded that Federal breached its statutory duties to investigate and to effectuate settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the duty to investigate, the record supports the district court's determination that Federal did not conduct a reasonable investigation before filing its suit for rescission. Specifically, the district court found that MacKay never confirmed her tentative conclusion regarding Morrison's authority over the accounts in question, and no one at Federal ever attempted to contact HPSC to obtain more information regarding the apparent discrepancy between HPSC's answer to Question 12 on the renewal application and the conclusions in the PwC report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, other than reviewing the materials submitted with HPSC's claim, it appears that Federal did no investigation of the available facts before denying coverage. Consequently, the district court correctly concluded that Federal's failure to investigate breached its statutory duty under chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also supports the district court's finding that Federal breached its statutory duty to effectuate settlement. An insurer's duty to make a settlement offer arises when \"liability has become reasonably clear.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)(f). The determination as to when liability is reasonably clear depends on when \"a reasonable person, with knowledge of the relevant facts and law, would probably have concluded, for good reason, that the insurer was liable to the plaintiff.\" <i>Nyer v. Winterthur Int'l,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span>, 461 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Demeo v.

Here, the district court considered liability sufficiently clear after Federal learned that Morrison did not have reconciliation and check-writing duties with respect to ACFC's fifteen operating accounts. Instead of admitting its error and making a settlement offer, however, Federal changed its legal theory, and when that one failed, Federal again shifted its position, finally settling on the theory that HPSC's misrepresentation regarding the petty cash account was material enough to warrant denying the claim. While we have some doubt that a reasonable person would \"probably\" have concluded that Federal was liable on HPSC's claim, we are not prepared to say that the court's conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal contends that it had a plausible basis for denying coverage at all times, even after it learned that HPSC's only misrepresentation involved the petty cash account, and that an insurer who has a good faith, plausible basis for denying a claim \"cannot ordinarily be said to have committed a violation of [chapter] 93A.\" <i>Lumbermens Mut.

Even if we were inclined to agree that Federal's basis for denying coverage was plausible, in that it was a \"[s]eemly or apparently valid\" legal theory, <i>Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary</i> 901 (1988), the district court explicitly determined, with sufficient support in the record, as explained below, that Federal was not acting in good faith after February 6, 2003. The absence of good faith supports the district court's unfair settlement practice determination, even in the face of a plausible coverage position. <i>See Guity v. Commerce Ins. Co.,</i> 36 Mass.App.Ct. 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1982126\"><a href=\"/opinion/1982126/guity-v-commerce-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 77-78 (1994) (\"A plausible, reasoned legal position that may ultimately turn out to be mistaken . . . is outside the scope of the punitive aspects of the combined application of c. 93A and c. 176D. An absence of good faith and the presence of extortionate tactics generally characterize the basis for a c. 93A-176D action based on unfair settlement practice.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Federal failed to conduct a reasonable investigation before seeking rescission and then failed to make a settlement offer once liability was reasonably clear, and thus that Federal breached its statutory duties. Therefore, we affirm the district court's legal conclusion that Federal violated chapter 93A by engaging in unfair claim settlement practices as defined in chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9). <i>See Cont'l Ins.
