's appeal, and in support thereof would respectfully show the Court the following:\n\f                             Introduction & Summary of Motion\n\n1. Appellants are Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP, LLC and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas L.P. Appellees\n\n   are Alfredo De La Garza, individually and as next friend for XXXXXX XX XX XXXXX AND\n\n   XXXXXXXX XX XX XXXXX, minors.\n\n2. Appellants filed their Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate on June 18, 2015. A copy of\n\n   that motion is attached as Exhibit \"A\". Appellees filed their response to appellants' Motion\n\n   to Compel Arbitration and to Abate on July 30, 2015. A copy of that response is attached as\n\n   Exhibit \"B\". On August 26, 2015, appellees filed their First Amended Response to appellants'\n\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. A copy of this amended response is attached as\n\n   \"Exhibit \"C\". On September 10, 2015, appellants filed their reply to appellees' Response to\n\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. A copy of appellants' reply is attached as Exhibit\n\n   \"D\". On September 11, 2015, appellees filed their first supplement to their First Amended\n\n   Response to appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate.            A copy of this\n\n   supplement is attached as Exhibit \"E\".       The hearing on appellants' Motion to Compel\n\n   Arbitration and to Abate was initially set on July 31,2015, but was reset at appellees' request\n\n   for September 11,2015 with agreement of counsel for appellants. On September 11,2015, the\n\n   trial court heard appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. Appellants' Motion\n\n   to Compel Arbitration and to Abate was denied by order dated September 11, 2015. See\n\n   Exhibit \"F\".\n\n3. Appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration\n\n   on October 1, 2015. A copy of this motion is attached as Exhibit \"G\". Appellees opposed\n\n   this motion and objected to the. affidavit of Ernest Nelson, attached to appellants' Motion for\n\n   Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration. A copy of appellees'\n\f   response is attached as Exhibit \"H\". On October 9, 2015, appellants filed their reply to\n\n   appellees' Response to Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel\n\n   Arbitration. A copy of appellants' reply is attached as Exhibit \"1\". The Hon. Elaine Palmer,\n\n   Judge of the 215th District Court denied appellants' Motion for Reconsideration of Order\n\n   Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration on October 12, 2015. A copy of the order is attached\n\n   as Exhibit \"J\".\n\n4. Appellants filed their Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2015. A copy of this notice is attached\n\n   hereto as Exhibit \"K\". In appellants' Notice of Appeal, they seek to appeal the court's order\n\n   denying appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate signed on September 11, 2015.\n\n   Appellants also seek to appeal the order denying defendant's motion for reconsideration of the\n\n   order denying the motion to compel arbitration signed by Judge Palmer on October 12, 2015.\n\n5. On October 14, 2015, appellants filed their Motion for Extension of Time to File Notice of\n\n   Appeal.\n\n6. The notice of appeal was untimely. The facts averred to by appellants' counsel fail to\n\n   reasonably explain the need for an extension.\n\n7. The order denying appellants' Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to\n\n   Compel Arbitration is not an appealable order.\n\n                                  Argument and Authorities\n\n8. This is an accelerated appeal pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 28.1. Perfecting the appeal is\n\n   completed by timely filing notice of appeal within 20 days pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(b)\n\n   and 26.1(b). Appellants' notice of appeal was filed 33 days after Judge Palmer's September\n\n   11, 2015 order was signed and is untimely. The notice should have been filed on October 1,\n\n   2015.\n\f9. The facts alleged in appellants' motion and supported by appellants' affidavit attached to their\n\n   motion for extension of time do not reasonably explain the need for extension as required by\n\n   Tex. R. App. P. 10.5(b)(l)(C).\n\n10. The reply filed by appellants in response to Appellees' Response to Appellants' Motion for\n\n   Extension of Time to File Notice of Appeal fails to address Thomas J. Smith's knowledge of\n\n   the deadline for filing the notice of appeal in an accelerated appeal. The verification of Kelly\n\n   C. Hartmann filed by appellants was not timely filed within fifteen days as required by Tex.\n\n   R. App. P. 26.3 and Tex. R. App. P. 10.5(b).\n\n11. Appellants also seek to appeal the October 12, 2015 order denying appellants' motion for\n\n   reconsideration of the trial court's order denying appellants' motion for arbitration and to\n\n   abate. This is a non-appealable order. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 51.016. 9 U.S.C. § 16(a).\n\n   The motion for reconsideration also did not extend the appellate timetable.               Hydro\n\n   Management Systems, LLC v. Jalin, Ltd., No. 04-09-00813-CV, 2010 WL 1817813 (Tex.\n\n   App.-San Antonio May 5, 2010, no pet. h.). See also Nabors Well Servs. Co. v. Aviles, No.\n\n   06-10-00018-CV, 2010 WL 2680087, at *1-2 (Tex. App. July 7, 2010, no pet. h.).\n\n12. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 51.016. provides that \"[i]n a matter subject to the [FAA], a\n\n   person may take an appeal or writ of error to the court of appeals from the judgment or\n\n   interlocutory order of a district court, county court at law, or county court under the same\n\n   circumstances that an appeal from a federal district court's order or decision would be permitted\n\n   by 9 U.S.C. Section 16.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.§ 51.016.\n\f13. Section 16(a) of the FAA, titled \"Appeals,\" provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n    *2 (a) An appeal may be taken from(1)-\n\n               (1) an order-\n\n               (A) refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title,\n\n               (B) denying a petition under section 4 of this title to order arbitration to proceed,\n\n               (C) denying an application under section 206 of this title to compel arbitration,\n\n               (D) confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award, or\n\n               (E) modifying, correcting, or vacating an award.\n\n   9 U.S.C. § 16(a) (2015).\n\n14. Lucchese Boot Co. v. Licon, 388 S.W.3d 365 (Tex. App. El Paso 2012, no pet. h.) is\n\n   distinguishable because it dealt with an amended motion to compel arbitration on an arbitration\n\n   agreement which had not previously been offered as a basis for its original motion to compel\n\n   arbitration. See also: Nazareth Hall Nursing Ctr. v. Castro, 374 S.W.3d 590 (Tex. App. El\n\n   Paso 2012, no pet. h.) (following Hydro Mgmt. Sys. LLC. and distinguishing Lucchese).\n\n                                              Prayer\n\n       Wherefore, premises considered, appellees, Alfredo De la Garza, XXXXXX XX XX\n\nXXXXX and XXXXXXXX XX XX XXXXX, minors, pray that this Court dismiss appellants'\n\nappeal for want of jurisdiction pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(a), and for such other and further\n\nrelief to which they may be entitled, whether in law or in equity.\n\f                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                            JOHN DAVID HART\n                                            State Bar No. 09147700\n\n\n                                            THE LAW OFFICES OF JOHN DAVID HART\n                                            Wells Fargo Tower\n                                            201 Main Street, Suite 1720\n                                            Fort Worth, Texas 76102\n                                            (817) 870-2102 - phone\n                                            (817) 332-5858 - facsimile\n                                            j ohnhart@hartlaw. com\n\n                                           ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEES, ALFREDO DE\n                                           LA GARZA, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS NEXT\n                                           FRIEND FOR XXXXXXX XX XX XXXXX and\n                                           XXXXXXXX XX XX XXXXX, MINORS\n\n\n\n                            CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE\n       Pursuant to Tex.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n        There is no valid agreement to arbitrate between Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza and\n\nDefendants Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC (hereinafter\n\nreferred to collectively as the Penn Virginia defendants). The incident made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit occurred on April 29, 2014 on the Welhausen A2H well in Lavaca County, Texas. The\n\nwork done between Nabors Completion & Production Services Co. (hereinafter referred to as\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's      Page 1\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\n                                         EXHIBIT \"B\"\n\f\"NCPS\"), and Penn V.irginia Oil & Gas, L.P., the operator of the well, was performed pursuant to\n\na Master Service Contract (hereinafter referred to as the \"MSC\") dated March 28, 2013. A copy\n\nof this MSC is attached as Exhibit \"A\". This MSC does not reference Nabors Industries, Inc.'s\n\nDispute Resolution Program (hereinafter referred to as the \"DRP\"), and does not provide that either\n\nPenn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. or Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC is an \"electing entity\" or would\n\nparticipate in Nabors Industries,    Inc~'s   DRP. A copy of the DRP is attached as Exhibit \"B\". The\n\nPenn Virginia defendants' argument that Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil &\n\nGas GP LLC are \"electing entity[ies ]\"under the DRP is not a valid argument. The Penn Virginia\n\ndefendants rely on a 2008 drilling contract between Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Nabors\n\nDrilling USA, LP for a well in Jefferson County, Texas, attached as Exhibit \"C\", and a 2010\n\ndrilling contract between Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC and Nabors Drilling USA, LP for a well\n\nin Oklahoma, attached as Exhibit \"D\", as the basis for their argument that they were an \"electing\n\nentity\" under the Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP. Both of these contracts were only valid for the\n\nterm for completion of operations for drilling those wells. Those contracts did not control any of\n\nthe work done on the Welhausen A2H well or the relationship between NCPS and the Penn\n\nVirginia entities for the work done on the Welhausen A2H well in April, 2014.\n\n        The drilling contracts relied on by the Penn Virginia defendants only apply to           \"pr~sent   and\n\nformer\" employees and applicants ofNabors' entities at the time of the contracts. Plaintiff Alfredo\n\nDe La Garza was not a \"present or former\" employee of any Nabors entity as of 2008 or 201 0, as\n\nnoted in Keith Nicholson's affidavit, attached as Exhibit \"E\".\n\n        Furthermore, arbitration cannot be compelled in this matter because claims asserted by\n\nPlaintiffs Alfredo De La do not fall within the scope of the DRP and its arbitration provisions.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants have failed to establish that Plaintiffs REDACTED                                    ,\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 2\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fminors, are subject to any valid arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs further contend that arbitration\n\nshould not be compelled in this matter because Defendants have waived any right to compel\n\narbitration in this matter.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Penn Virginia defendants'\n\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate be denied. In the alternative, Plaintiffs request that\n\ntheir continuance of Defendants' motion be granted; that they be allowed to conduct discovery as\n\nto arbitrability; that they be allowed to participate in a full evidentiary hearing as to the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate; and that upon hearing the\n\narguments and evidence, that Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate be denied.\n\n        Plaintiffs request that their claims against Defendant Mike Ferguson and Defendant Oaks\n\nPersonnel Services, Inc. d/b/a The Oaks Group be severed from any claims against the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants and that these claims be tried on October 19, 2015. While Defendant Mike\n\nFerguson has pled for arbitration, he has not filed a motion for arbitration, a notice of arbitration,\n\nnor has he joined in the Penn Virginia defendants' motion for arbitration. Defendant Oaks\n\nPersonnel Services, Inc. d/b/a The Oaks Group has not asserted a claim or plead that it is entitled\n\nto arbitration in connection with Plaintiffs' claims.\n\n                        II. INTRODUCTION & FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        On April29, 2014, Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza was an employee ofNabors Completion\n\n& Production Services Co. (hereinafter referred to as \"NCPS\"). NCPS is a subsidiary of Nabors\n\nIndustries, Inc. On this date, Plaintiff was working on Nabors Rig No. 1480, outside of Shiner,\n\nTexas. Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. was the operator of the well and was directing workover and\n\ncompletion operations on the well.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 3\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        The well service operations on the W elhausen A2H well were being conducted pursuant to\n\na MSC between Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and NCPS dated March 28, 2013. The MSC is\n\nattached to this response as Exhibit \"A\". By its terms, the MSC supersedes all prior agreements\n\nbetween the parties. The agreement states in part that, \"This Contract shall become effective the\n\ndate first hereinabove written and shall supersede all prior service contracts between the parties\n\nhereto with respect to new work or services commenced during the term of this Contract to be\n\nperformed in connection with this Contract.\" Exhibit \"A\", page 2. There is no reference in the\n\nMSC to Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP. The MSC does not contain an agreement that either of the\n\nPenn Virginia defendants and NCPS agree that Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. or Penn Virginia\n\nOil & Gas GP LLC will be an \"electing entity\" in Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP.\n\n        During the operations, there was a pressure control failure that caused senous and\n\npermanent injuries to Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza. As a result of the serious, permanent, and\n\ndisabling injuries to Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza, minors Plaintiffs REDACTED\n\n                          have suffered a loss of consortium.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed this action against the Penn Virginia defendants on July 24. 2014. A copy\n\nof this petition is attached as Exhibit \"F\". Plaintiffs' filed their First Amended Original Petition\n\non September 8, 2014. A copy of Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"G\". Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Original Petition on October 1, 2014. A copy is of\n\nthis petition is attached as Exhibit \"H\".\n\n        On June 18, 2015, the Penn Virginia defendants filed their Motion to Compel Arbitration\n\nand to Abate. A copy of the Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP is attached as Exhibit \"B\". In this\n\nmotion, the Penn Virginia defendants contend that Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants fall within\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 4\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fthe scope of a valid arbitration agreement governed by Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP and the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act.\n\n        The Nabors' DRP states that\"[t]he Program is designed to provide a means for the quick,\n\nfair, accessible, and inexpensive resolution of Disputes between the Company and the Company's\n\npresent and former Employees and Applicants for employment related to and arising out of a\n\ncurrent, former, or potential employment relationship with the Company.\" Exhibit \"B\" at p. 2.\n\nNabors' DRP further provides the following definitions:\n\n        \"'Company' means Sponsor and every direct or indirect subsidiary (whether a corporation,\n        limited liability company, company partnership or other legal entity of Sponsor, any\n        Electing Entity ... provided, however, that in the case of an Electing Entity, \"Company\"\n        shall include the Electing Entity only to the extent provided in the Electing Entity's\n        agreement to be bound by the Program.\"\n\n        \" 'Dispute' means all legal and equitable claims, demand, and controversies, of whatever\n        nature or kind, whether in contract, tort, under statute or regulation, or some other law,\n        between persons bound by the Program or by agreement to resolve Disputes under the\n        Program, or between a person bound by the Program and a person or entity otherwise\n        entitled to its benefits, including, but not limited to, any matters with respect to: ... any\n        personal injury allegedly incurred in or about a Company workplace or in the course and\n        scope of an Employee's employment.\"\n\n        \" 'Electing Entity' means any legal entity that has agreed to be bound by the Program as\n        provided herein.\"\n\n        \"'Employee' means any person who is or has been in the employment of the Company on\n        or after the effective date of this Program ... \"\n\n        \"'Party' means, with respect to a particular Dispute, affected person and/or entities bound\n        by this Program.\"\n\n        \" 'Sponsor' means Nabors Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\"\n\n!d. at pp. 2-4.\n\n        As to \"Electing Entities\", the Nabors' DRP provides:\"[ c]orporations or other.legal entities,\n\nnot otherwise Parties, may elect to be bound by this Program by written agreement with Sponsor.\"\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 5\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fI d. at p. 7. The DRP further provides that: \"[ e]lection may be made only as to some types of\n\nDisputes, or only as to some persons, in the discretion of Electing Entity.\" Id.\n\n        The Penn Virginia defendants rely on the 2008 International Association of Drilling\n\nContractors Drilling Bid Proposal and Daywork Drilling Contract- U.S. (hereinafter referred to\n\nas the \"2008 drilling contract\"), attached as Exhibit \"C\". NCPS was not a party to this contract.\n\nThe 2008 drilling contract between Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and NaborsDrilling USA, LP\n\nwas only in force and effect until drilling operations were completed for the well which was being\n\ndrilled in Jefferson County, Texas in 2008. The term of that agreement is defined in Paragraph 6.1:\n\n        \"Duration of Contract: This Contract shall remain in full force and effect until drilling\n        operations are con1pleted on the well or v1ells specified in Paragraph 1 above, or for a term\n        of         , commencing on the date specified in Paragraph 2 above.\" Exhibit \"C\", p. 1.\n\n        By its terms, the provisions relied on by the Penn Virginia defendants relating to Nabors\n\nIndustries, Inc.'s DRP only apply to \"the present and former Employees and Applicants ofNabors\"\n\nas of the date of this drilling contract in 2008:\n\n        \"Operator, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations, as well as the employees,\n        officers and directors of each (collectively, \"Operator\") is cognizant of the Nabors Dispute\n        Resolution Program and wishes to become an Electing Entity, as defined in that Program.\n        Accordingly, Operator and Nabors Industries, Inc.

NCPS was also not a party to this\n\ncontract. The 2010 drilling contract between Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC and Nabors Drilling\n\nUSA, LP was only in force and effect until drilling operations were completed for the well which\n\nwas being drilled in Logan County, Oklahoma in 2010.

In re\n\nFirst Merit Bank, NA., 52 S.W.3d 749, 753 (Tex. 2001) (orig. proceeding). If one party denies\n\nthat there is a binding arbitration agreement, the trial court may summarily decide whether to\n\ncompel arbitration on the basis of uncontroverted affidavits, pleadings, discovery, and\n\nstipulations. Jack B. Anglin Co. v.

CODE§ 171.021.\n\n        When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate under the FAA, court should apply\n\nordinary state law principles regarding the formation of contract. In reD. Wilson Canst. Co., 196\n\nS.W.3d 774,781 (Tex. 2006); 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. seq.; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE§ 171.001\n\net seq. An arbitration agreement must meet all the requisite contract elements, and even though\n\nthere is a strong presumption favoring arbitration, the presumption only arises after the part seeking\n\nto compel arbitration proves that a valid arbitration agreement exists. J.M Davidson, Inc. v.\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 8\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fWebster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 227 (Tex. 2003); In re Halliburton, 80 S.W.3d 566, 570 (Tex. 2002).\n\nThe policy in favor of arbitration agreements does not apply when a court is examining the\n\nthreshold question of whether an arbitration agreement exists. Granite Rock Co. v. Int 'l\n\nBrotherhood ofTeamsters, 130 S. Ct. 2847 (2010); In re Morgan Stanley & Co., 293 S.W.3d 182,\n\n183 (Tex. 2009). If the trial court finds there is a valid agreement to arbitrate, the burden shifts to\n\nthe party opposing arbitration to prove his defenses. JM Davidson, Inc., 128 S.W.3d at 227. An\n\nagreement to arbitrate may be avoided on a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation\n\nof a contract. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE§ 171.001; Rachal v. Reitz, 403 S.W.3d 840, 843\n\n(Tex. 2013).\n\n        Once a valid agreement to arbitrate has been established, the court must further determine\n\nwhether the non-movant's claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. In re First\n\nMerit Bank, NA., 52 S.W.3d at 753. Federal policy embodied in the FAA favors agreements to\n\narbitrate and courts must resolve any doubts about an arbitration agreement's scope in favor of\n\narbitration. !d. at 753. But those public policies favoring arbitration do not extend to any favorable\n\ninclination one way or the other with regard to the questions of who is bound by the arbitration\n\nagreement because the purpose of the FAA is to \"make arbitration agreement as enforceable as\n\nother contracts, but not more so.\" In re SSP Partners d/b/a Circle K and Jose Almaguer, 241\n\nS.W.3d 162, 167-168 (Tex. App.          Corpus Christi 2007, orig. proceeding [mand. denied]).\n\n\n                                   IV. ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n    A. Defendants have failed to prove the existence of an agreement to arbitrate between\n       Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza and the Penn Virginia defendants.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 9\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        The Court cannot properly compel arbitration of Plaintiffs claims in this matter because the\n\nPenn Virginia defendants have failed to prove that an agreement to arbitrate exists between either\n\nPenn Virginia entity and Plaintiffs.\n\n        In Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration, there is no contention that there is any direct\n\narbitration agreement between Plaintiffs and the Penn Virginia defendants. Rather, the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants rely entirely on Nabors' Dispute Resolution Program relating to Plaintiff\n\nAlfredo De La Garza's employment with Nabors Industries, Inc.'s subsidiary, NCPS.\n\n        The initial burden of the party seeking to compel arbitration - to establish the arbitration\n\nagreement's existence       includes proving the entity seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement\n\nwas a party to it or had the right to enforce the agreement notwithstanding. See Pepe Int 'l Dev. Co.\n\nv. Pub Brewing Co., 915 S.W.2d 925, 931 (Tex. App.- Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n        The MSC specifically provides that it will govern work by and among Penn Virginia Oil\n\n& Gas Corporation, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P., Penn Virginia MC Energy L.L.C., and Nabors\n\nCompletion & Production Services Co. The parties to that agreement did not choose to include\n\nany reference to the Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP. The contract did not include any agreement\n\nthat either Penn Virginia defendant would be an \"electing entity\" in the Nabors Industries, Inc.'s\n\nDRP. As a matter of law, there is no agreement to arbitrate between Plaintiffs and the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants based on the MSC.\n\n        Despite their contentions, the Penn Virginia defendants have not established their right to\n\nenforce any arbitration agreement that may exist between Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza and\n\nNCPS. The Penn Virginia defendants cannot avail themselves of the Nabors Dispute Resolution\n\nProgram as an \"Electing Entity\", as any agreement entered into by Defendants to be bound by\n\nNabors' DRP fails by the express terms of the DRP.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 10\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        As dictated by the terms of Nabors' DRP, an Electing Entity \"may elect to be bound by\n\nthis Program by written agreement with Sponsor.\" Id. atp. 7. The Sponsor under the DRP is Nabors\n\nIndustries, Inc. Id. at p. 4. Although Defendants state that it is an \"undisputed fact\" that they are\n\nElecting Entities ofN abors' DRP, no written agreement between the Penn Virginia defendants and\n\nNabors Industries, Inc., as a signatory, is attached to Defendants' motion establishing such status.\n\nInstead, Defendants attached two \"IADC contracts\" to its motions: (1) a 2008 contract executed\n\nby Defendant Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and Nabors Drilling ysA, LP. Exhibit \"C\"; and, (2)\n\na 2010 contract executed by Penn Virginia MC Energy and Nabors Drilling USA, LP. Exhibit\n\n\"D\". Neither contract establishes a written agreement with Nabors Industries, Inc., the Sponsor of\n\nNabors' DRP; therefore, the Penn Virginia defendants cannot take advantage of any agreement to\n\narbitrate that may exist between Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza and his employer NCPS because\n\nDefendants do not qualify as an Electing Entity under the Program. Each of these contracts would\n\ncertainly have expired by its own terms years before the incident made the basis of the suit\n\noccurred.\n\n        Plaintiffs should not be compelled to arbitrate their claims against the Penn Virginia\n\ndefendants in absence of an agreement to do so. Trico Marine Servs., Inc. v. Stewart & Stevenson\n\nTechnical Services, Inc., 73 S.W.3d 545, 548 {Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, orig.\n\nproceeding [mand. denied]). The burden is upon the party seeking to compel arbitration to establish\n\nthe existence of an arbitration agreement. In re Oakwood Mobile Homes, Inc., 987 S.W.2d 571,\n\n573 (Tex. 1999). Because Defendants have failed to meet this burden, Defendant's Motion to\n\nCompel Arbitration and to Abate should be denied as to the claims of Plaintiffs Alfredo De La\n\nGarza and minor Plaintiffs REDACTED                                               .\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 11\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f    B. Defendants have failed to establish that Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza's claims are\n       within the scope of any arbitration agreement.\n\n        Defendants have failed to establish that Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza's claims fall within\n\nthe scope of any agreement to arbitrate.\n\n        If a valid arbitration agreement is found to exist, the Court would then need to determine\n\nif the claims asserted by Plaintiffs fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Personal Sec.\n\n& Safety Sys., Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 297 F.3d 388, 392 (5th Cir. 2002); In re Oakwood Mobile\n\nHomes, Inc., 987 S.W.2d at 573. Only matters subject to the covenant of arbitration should be\n\narbitrated. See Wee Tots Pediatrics, P.A. v. Morohunfola, 268 S.W.3d 784, 793 (Tex. App.-Fort\n\nWorth 2008, no pet. & orig. proceeding). In determining whether a claim falls within the scope of\n\nan arbitration agreement, looks at the facts alleged, rather than the legal causes of actions\n\npresented, and considers whether the facts touch matters covered by the underlying arbitration\n\nagreement. Rachal v. Reitz, 403 S.W.3d at 846. Here, Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza's claims are·\n\noutside the express scope of the purported arbitration agreement and elections allegedly made by\n\nthe Penn Virginia defendants in 2008 and 2010.\n\n        In Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration, the Penn Virginia defendants contend that\n\nPlaintiff Alfredo De La Garza's claims \"clearly fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement\"\n\nbecause \"the DRP clearly and unequivocally states that it applies to and binds the Company, each\n\nEmployee and Applicant.\" Defendants argue that Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza was an employee\n\nof NCPS at the time of the incident giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims and therefore is subject to\n\nNabors' DRP. Defendants' contentions fail to take into account the specific terms of the election\n\nmade by Defendants its written agreements to be bound by the Nabors' DRP. Specifically, in the\n\nagreements the Penn Virginia defendants elected to be bound by Nabors' DRP as to current and\n\nformer employees of Nabors Industries, Inc.\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 12\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        In their motion, Defendants attached two \"IADC contracts\": (1) the 2008 contact executed\n\nby Defendant Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and Nabors Drilling USA, LP (Exhibit \"C\"); and, (2)\n\nthe 2010 contract executed by Penn Virginia MC Energy and Nabors Drilling USA, LP (Exhibit\n\n\"D\").   Defendants contend that a provision in the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" of these\n\ncontracts constitutes Defendants' agreement to be bound to Nabors' DRP. In both contracts, the\n\nprovision states:\n\n        \"Operator, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations, as well as the employees,\n        officers and directors of each (collectively, \"Operator\") is cognizant ofthe Nabors Dispute\n        Resolution Program and wishes to become an Electing Entity, as defined in that Program.\n        Accordingly, Operator and Nabors Industries, Inc. (\"Nabors\") hereby agree that Operator\n        is an Electing Entity as to all Disputes between Operator and the present and former\n        Employees and Applicants ofNabors\".\n\nExhibit \"C\", page 1 of the 2008 drilling contract's Exhibit \"C\": Contractors Special Provisions\n\n(emphasis added); Exhibit \"D\", page 1 of the 2008 drilling contract's Exhibit \"C\": Contractors\n\nSpecial Provisions (emphasis added).\n\n        Under the express terms of the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" that Defendants contend\n\nbinds them to Nabors' DRP, Defendants elected to limit its participation in the DRP as to only\n\ncurrent and former employees of Nabors Industries, Inc. Nabors' DRP specifically provides for\n\nsuch an election, stating that: \"[ e]lection may be made only as to some types of Disputes, or only\n\nas to some persons, in the discretion of Electing Entity.\" Exhibit \"B\", page 7.\n\n        Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza was hired by NCPS as a crew\n\nworker on July 22, 2013. Exhibit \"E\" at 3. Further, it is undisputed that Plaintiff Alfredo De La\n\nGarza was an employee of NCPS at the time of the incident giving rise to his claims against\n\nDefendants. I d. at 3. As such, Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza was not a current or former employee\n\nof Nabors Industries, Inc. or any subsidiary during or prior to 2010. The drilling contracts were\n\nentered into on September 23, 2008 and September 8, 2010, years before Plaintiff Alfredo De La\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 13\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fGarza applied to or was ever employed by NCPS, a subsidiary of Nabors Industries, Inc. Plaintiff\n\nAlfredo De La Garza's claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration agreement alleged to exist\n\nby the Penn Virginia defendants. Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate should\n\nbe denied as to the claims of Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza or his minor children.\n\n    C. Defendants have failed to establish that Plaintiffs REDACTED\n              loss of consortium claims are subject to arbitration.\n\n        Defendants have failed to establish a valid arbitration agreement that encompasses the loss\n\nof consortium claims of the minor children of Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza, REDACTED\n\n                 A child can recover for loss of parental consortium when the parent suffered\n\nserious, permanent, and disabling injury or death. In re SSP Partners, 241 S.W.3d at 171 (citing\n\nReagan v. Vaughn, 804 S.W. 2d 463, 467 (Tex. 1990)). Although a claim for loss of parental\n\nconsortium is derivative to the extent that liability for the parent's injury must be established, the\n\nclaim is separate and independent and not automatically extinguished merely because, for instance,\n\nthe injured parent settled his claim for personal injuries. I d. (citing Lehamn v. Har-Con Corp., 76\n\nS.W.3d 555, 564 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.)). Because Defendants have\n\nprovided no evidence of a written agreement signed by the children, an express provision of\n\nNabors' DRP binding the children to arbitration, or the application of direct-benefits estoppel,\n\nDefendants have failed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs REDACTED                                    claims are\n\nsubject to arbitration.\n\n        Arbitration is a matter of contract and should not be compelled without an agreement. Trico\n\nMarine Servs., Inc., 73 S.W.3d at 548. As previously addressed, public policies favoring arbitration\n\ndo not extend to any favorable inclination one way or the other with regard to the questions of who\n\nis bound by the arbitration agreement because the purpose of the FAA is to \"make arbitration\n\nagreement as enforceable as other contracts, but not more so.\" In re SSP Partners, 241 S.W.3d at\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 14\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f167-168 (court refused to enforce an arbitration agreement in connection with claims for loss of\n\nparental consortium by minor children of an etnployee who was injured on the job and who has\n\nsigned an enforceable agreement to arbitrate all disputes relating to her employment). In this case,\n\nthe Penn Virginia defendants contend that the claims of Plaintiffs REDACTED                                  ,\n\nminors, are \"subject to the arbitration agreement as they are derivative of De La Garza['s] claims.\"\n\nDefendants provide no other basis or support for this contention.\n\n        Under Nabors' DRP, a \"dispute\" is defined as \"all legal and equitable claims, demand, and\n\ncontroversies, of whatever nature or kind, whether in contract, tort, under statute or regulation, or\n\nsome other law, between persons bound by the Program or by agreement to resolve Disputes under\n\nthe Program, or between a person bound by the Program and a person or entity otherwise entitled\n\nto its benefits, including, but not limited to, any matters with respect to: ... any personal injury\n\nallegedly incurred in or about a Company workplace or in the course and scope of an Employee's\n\nemployment.\" Id. at p. 3. This provision does not expressly bind the minor children of any person\n\nbound by the Program, unless the children are found to be \"otherwise entitled to [the Program's]\n\nbenefits.\" Id. Here, the Penn Virginia defendants have provided no evidence that Plaintiffs REDA\n                                                                                                       CTED\n                                are third-party beneficiaries of the purported arbitration agreement\n\nbetween their father and NCPS. In re SSP Partners, 241 3d at 170-171 (court refused to apply\n\ndirect benefits estoppel because minor children were not bringing claims that sought direct benefits\n\nfrom a contract containing an arbitration clause, nor were they seeking and obtaining substantial\n\nbenefits from the contact itself outside the litigation). Moreover, Plaintiffs REDACTED\n\nREDACT did not individually sign any written agreement that would bind them to the Nabors'\nED\nDRP. \"Texas law does not ordinarily bind children to the contracts their parents sign. In re SSP\n\nPartners, 241 S.W.3d at 170 ((quoting Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. v. Gaskmap, 280 F.3d 1069,\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 15\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f1076 (5 1h Cir. 2002) (applying Texas law), opinion supplemented on denial ofreh'g, 303 F.3d 570\n\n(5th Cir. 2002)( court held minor children were not bound by arbitration agreement where children\n\ndid not personally sign the arbitration agreement and there was no provision expressly stating that\n\nparents, on behalf of their children, agreed to submit the children's claims to arbitration)). Plaintiff\n\nAlfredo De La Garza did not sign any agreement or document acknowledging the Nabors' DRP\n\non behalf of his minor children or as representative of his children. Additionally, there is no\n\nprovision within any executed documents or the Nabors' DRP stating that Plaintiff Alfredo De La\n\nGarza agreed to submit his children's claims to arbitration. Absent express agreement, Texas law\n\ndoes not require that minors arbitrate \"simply because they are minors and their claims are related\n\nto that of their pa~ent.\" I d. at 170. Defendants have failed to establish that minor Plaintiffs REDA\n                                                                                                       CTED\nREDACTED                           parental consortium claims are bound by any valid arbitration\n\nagreement. Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate should be denied as to the\n\nclaims of the minor children.\n\n    D. The Penn Virginia defendants waived their right to compel arbitration\n\n        Even if the Penn Virginia defendants had established that a valid arbitration agreement\n\nexists and Plaintiffs' claims fall within its scope, Defendants have substantially invoked the\n\njudicial process and have waived their right to compel arbitration in this matter.\n\n        A party seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement can lose their right to do so through\n\nwaiver. The right to have a dispute submitted to arbitration, like any other contractual right, may\n\nbe waived either expressly or implicitly. Perry Homes v. Cull, 258 S.W.3d 580, 593 (Tex. 2008),\n\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 952 (2009). Express waiver arises when a party affirmatively indicates that\n\nit wishes to resolve the case in the judicial forum, rather than through arbitration. In re Citigroup\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 16\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fGlobal Markets, Inc., 258 S.W.3d 623, 626 (Tex. 2008). Implied waiver arises when a party acts\n\ninconsistently with the right to arbitrate and prejudices the opposing party. Id.\n\n           The legal test for a waiver of arbitration requires conduct or activity inconsistent with the\n\nright to arbitration and prejudice to the party claiming waiver. In re Bank One, NA., 216 S.W.3d\n\n825, 826 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). A party waives an arbitration clause when\n\nit substantially invokes the judicial process to the other party's detriment. Perry Homes, 258\n\nS.W.3d at 590. To invoke the judicial process, a party must engage in some overt act in court that\n\nevinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration. Pilot\n\nTravel Centers, LLC v. McCray, 416 S.W.3d 168, 187 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2013, no pet.). As it\n\napplies to waiver, \"prejudice\" relates to inherent unfairness in terms of delay, expense, or damag~\n\nto a party's legal position that occurs when the party attempts to have it both ways by switching\n\nbetween litigation and arbitration to its own advantage. Kennedy Hodges, L.L.P. v. Gobellan,             ~33\n\n\nS.W.3d 542, 545 (Tex. 2014) (per curiam); Perry Homes, 258 S.W.3d at 597.\n\n           The issue of whether there has been a waiver of arbitration rights is to be decided case by\n\ncase based on the totality of the circumstances. Gobellan, 433 S.W.3d at 545; Perry Homes, 258\n\nS.W.3d at 591. In assessing the totality of the circumstances, the court will consider the following\n\nfactors:\n\n    (1) whether the movant was the plaintiff, who chose to file in court, or the defendant, who\n         merely responded;\n    (2) how long the movant delayed before seeking arbitration;\n    (3) when the movant knew of the arbitration clause;\n    (4) whether the movant sought or opposed arbitration earlier in the case;\n    (5) how much time and expense had been incurred in litigation;\n    (6) whether activity in court would be duplicated in arbitration;\n    (7) whether the movant filed affirmative claims or dispositive motions or sought judgment on\n         the merits;\n    (8) how much discovery had been conducted and who initiated it;\n    (9) how much of the discovery would be useful in arbitration; and\n    (1 0) how much pretrial activity related to the merits, rather than arbitrability or jurisdiction.\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 17\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fPerry Homes, 258 S.W.3d at 591-592.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed this case against the Penn Virginia defendants on July 24, 2014. Exhibit\n\n\"F\". Plaintiffs' filed their First Amended Original Petition on September 8, 2014. Exhibit \"G\".\n\nPlaintiffs filed their Second Amended Original Petition on October 1, 2014. Exhibit \"H\".\n\n        On August 25, 2014, the Penn Virginia defendants filed their Original Answer which was\n\nnot subject to a motion to compel arbitration. Defendants filed a First Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Amended Petition on April 10, 2015. Defendants waited until the filing of this\n\nanswer to plead in the alternative that Defendants would assert the affirmative defenses of\n\narbitration and award. On April 20, 2015, Defendants filed their Second Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Amended Petition. It was not until this answer that Defendants specifically\n\nplead that Plaintiffs' claims are \"subject to mandatory binding arbitration and as such this suit must\n\nbe abated and/or dismissed. On this same date, Defendants sent a notice of arbitration. A copy of\n\nthis notice is attached as Exhibit \"J\".\n\n        This case has been pending before this Court for over a year. Defendants waited until June\n\n18, 2015, to file their Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. In the meantime, Defendants\n\nhave propounded interrogatories on Plaintiffs; submitted requests for production and requests for\n\nadmissions; participated in numerous depositions; and, responded to Plaintiffs' written discovery.\n\nDefendants did not raise the issue of arbitration in any motions, pleadings, or filings made before\n\ntheir amended answer filed on April 10, 2015. Defendants delayed in filing a motion to compel\n\narbitration until approximately four months before the date scheduled for trial of October 19, 2015.\n\nThis delay wasted judicial resources and disadvantaged Plaintiffs who are preparing for an October\n\n19, 2015 trial. Defendants have caused detriment and prejudice to Plaintiffs through their delay in\n\nseeking arbitration to the extent that Plaintiffs' trial setting may be delayed.\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 18\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        While Defendant Mike Ferguson has pled for arbitration, he has not filed a motion for\n\narbitratio.n, a notice of arbitration, nor has he joined in the Penn Virginia defendants' motion for\n\narbitration. Defendant Oaks Personnel Services, Inc. d/b/a The Oaks Group has not asserted a\n\nclaim or plead that it is entitled to arbitration in connection with Plaintiffs' claims. This case\n\nshould proceed to trial against Defendant Mike Ferguson and Defendant Oaks Personnel Services,\n\nInc. d/b/a The Oaks Group on October 19, 2015.\n\n                                     V.

A partir de entonces,\n   AAA o JAMS podnin descalificar dicha persona y su\n   decision sera concluyente.\n\n7. Vacantes\n\n    Si hubiera una vacante por cualquier raz6n o si un arbitro\n    designado no pudiera ejercer en forma oportuna, se debera\n    aplicar el proceso para determinar nombramientos descripto\n    en la Clausula 5 para la selecci6n de un arbitro substituto.\n\n8.

After I administered an oath to affiant, the\naffiant testified:\n\nL      \"My name is Keith Nicholson. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and capable of\n       making this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge\n       and are true and correct.\n\n2..    I am Assistant General Counsel for Nabors Corporate Services, Inc.\n\n3.     In my capacity as Assistant General Counsel, I am required to be familiar with Nabors\n       Industries, Inc.'s corporate structure and the relationship of its various subsidiaries and\n       affiliated companies. I am also required to be familiar with the Nabors Dispute\n       Resolution Program (\"DRP\").\n\n4.     Nabors Industries, Inc. is the \"Sponsor\" of the Nabors DRP as that term is defmed by the\n       DRP. A true and correct copy of the DRP is attached to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-A.\n\n5...   The DRP provides that it applies to all direct and indirect subsidiaries of Nabors\n       Industries, Inc., as well as all \"Electing Entities\"· that have agreed to be bound by same.\n\n6.     Nabors Completion & Production Services Co. (\"NCPS\") was a subsidiary of Nabors\n\n\n                                                                                           EXHIBIT\n\n                                                                                     I f\n\f      Industries, Inc. at the time of the April 29, 2014 incident which makes the basis of the\n      lawsuit.\n\n7.    On September 23, 2008, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP agreed to be bound by the DRP as\n      an \"Electing Entity\" in the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" contained in the International\n      Association of Drilling Contractors (\"IADC\") Drilling Contract between it and Nabors\n      Drilling USA LP. A true and correct copy of the IADC Contract is attached in its entirety\n      to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-B. The Contractors Special Provisions portion has been\n      pulled out for reference and is attached as Exhibit 1-C.\n\n8..   The Contractors Special Provisions page states at paragraph 16 that \"Operator, its parent,\n      subsidiary, and affiliated corporations ... (collectively \"Operator\") is cognizant of the\n      Nabors Dispute Resolution Program and wishes to become an Electing Entity, as defined\n      in that Program. Accordingly, Operator and Nabors Industries, Inc. (\"Nabors\") hereby\n      agree that Operator is an Electing Entity ... \"\n\n9.:   In addition, on September 8, 2010, Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC agreed to be bound\n      by the DRP as an \"Electing Entity\" in the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" contained in\n      the International Association of Drilling Contractors (''IADC\") Drilling Contract between\n      it and Nabors Drilling USA LP. A true and correct copy of the IADC Contract is attached\n      in its entirety to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-D. The Contractors Special Provisions portion\n      has been pulled out for reference and is attached as Exhibit 1-E. It is my understanding\n      that Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC is a subsidiary or affiliated corporation of Penn\n      Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and/or Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP, LLC.\n\n10.   As an \"Electing Entity,\" Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and Penn Virginia Oil\n      & Gas GP, LLC are required to resolve disputes with any past or present employee(s) or\n      applicant(s) of Nabors Industries, Inc. or its subsidiaries in accordance with the DRP.\n\n11.   Based upon my review of the personnel file of Mr. Adame, I can confirm that Mr. Adan1e\n      was employed by NCPS, and that he executed various documents that acknowledged that\n      he received, reviewed, and accepted the terms and conditions of the DRP.\n\n12.   Specifically, my review of the relevant documents confirms that on January 2, 2013, Mr.\n      Adame executed a document entitled \"Application For Hourly And Daily Employment,\"\n      a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-F. Mr. Adame acknowledged\n      and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute Resolution\n      Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.\"\n\n13.   Further, on January 7, 2013, Mr. Adame executed a document entitled \"Employee\n      Acknowledgement Concerning Nabors Dispute Resolution Program,\" a true and correct\n      copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-H. The document specifically states, \"I have\n      received a copy of the Nabors Dispute Resolution Program.\" Mr. Adame acknowledged\n      and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute Resolution\n      Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.''\n\f14.   Mr. Adame was employed by NCPS as a crew worker. As a crew worker, Mr. Adame's\n      job duties and responsibilities included the operation of hand and power tools to perform\n      maintenance and repairs to oil or gas wells and related equipment. Mr. Adame's job\n      duties also involved activities associated with rigging-up and rigging-down work over\n      rigs, pulling levers or turning handles to extend hydraulic or screw-type jacks to support\n      and level the rig, laying steel production rods, tubing, and casing, and other tasks\n      necessary to support operations. While employed by NCPS, Mr. Adame was never a\n      commercial truck driver or transportation worker.\n\n15.   Based upon my review of the personnel file of Mr. Alfredo De La Garza, I can confirm\n      that Mr. De La Garza was employed by NCPS, and that he executed various documents\n      that acknowledged that he received, reviewed, and accepted the terms and conditions of\n      the DRP.\n\n16.   Specifically, my review of the relevant documents confirms that on July 16, 2013, Mr. De\n      La Garza executed a document entitled \"Application For Hourly And Daily\n      Employment,\" a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-G. By his\n      signature, Mr. De La Garza acknowledged and agreed that he is \"required to adhere to the\n      Dispute Resolution Program and its requirement for submission of all claims\n      to ... arbitration.\"\n\n17~   Further, on July 22, 2013, Mr. De La Garza executed a document entitled \"Employee\n      Acknowledgement Concerning Nabors Dispute Resolution Program,'' a true and correct\n      copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-I. The document specifically states, \"I have\n      received a copy of the Nabors Dispute Resolution Program.\" Mr. De La Garza\n      acknowledged and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute\n      Resolution Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.\"\n\n18.   I\\1r. De La Garza was employed by NCPS as a crew worker. As a crew worker, Mr. De\n      La Garza's job duties and responsibilities included the operation of hand and power tools\n      to perform maintenance and repairs to oil or gas wells and related equipment. Mr. De La\n      Garza's job duties also involved activities associated with rigging-up and rigging-down\n      work over rigs, pulling levers or turning handles to extend hydraulic or screw-type jacks\n      to support and level the rig, laying steel production rods, tubing, and casing, and other\n      tasks necessary to support operations. Mr. De La Garza's job duties and responsibilities\n      did not include the movement of goods in interstate commerce. While employed by\n      NCPS, Mr. De La Garza was never a commercial truck driver or transportation worker.\n\n19.   At all times relevant to this matter, NCPS was engaged in interstate commerce as it was\n      in the business of providing services for the development of oil and gas resources that are\n      placed into commerce in both Texas and other states of the United States.\n\n20.   On information and belief, Penn Virginia is also engaged in interstate commerce as it is\n      in the business of producing oil and gas resources that are placed into commerce in both\n      Texas and other states of the United States.\n\f2L            Attached as Exhibit 1-A to my affidavit is a true and correct copy of Nabors Industries,\n              Inc.'s DRP booklet, in English and Spanish, respectively.

In doing so, PVOG became an HEiecting Entity\" to the DRP such that\n       Mr. De La Garza's claims against PVOG are subject to arbitration,\n\n              The DRP provides a means for the \"resolution of Disputes between the Company and the\n       Company's present and fonner Employees.\" As you will see at page 2 of the DRP, the\n       \"Company\" is defined to include Nabors Industries, Inc.~ its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and\n       Electing Entities. Because NCPS is a subsidiary of Nabors Industries, Inc.t NCPS is part of the\n       ~~company.\" Page 2 states further that parties that are Electing Entities to the DRP are also\n       included in the definition of the \"Company.\" Because PVOG is an Electing Entity to the DRPt it\n       too is part of the ''Con1pany.\" Finally) the DRP defines \"Disputeu as \"all legal and equitable\n       claims~ demands, and controversies ... whether in contract (or) tort. .. between persons bound by\n       the Program ... or between a person bound by the Program and a person or entity otherwise\n       entitled to (the P1·ogram's) benefits.\" The definition includes \"any personal injury incurred .. ,in\n       the course and scope of an Employee's employment.\"\n\n               Because Mr. De La Garza, an employee of NCPS) has filed a claim against PVOG, an\n       Electing Entity to the DRP, he has filed a claim against the ~'Company.\" Pursuant to his\n       contractual agreement to submit such clahns to the DRP, Mr. De La Garza's clain1s against\n       PVOG are subject to arbitration. The arbitration agreement between Nabors, its employees, and\n       its employees' heirs and beneficiaries has been foWld valid on numerous occasions. E.g. Nabors\n       Drilling USA, LP v. Carpenter, 198 S.W.3d 240, 249 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2006, orig.\n       proceeding). Most recently; the San Antonio Fourth Court of Appeals found that the\n       beneficiaries of a deceased Nabors ernployee were bound by the decedent's agreement to\n       arbitrate pursuant to Nabors' DRP. Nabors Drilling USA, LP v. Pena, 385 S.W.3d 103 (Tex.\n       App.-San Antonio 20 12).\n\n                It is undisputed that Mr. De La Garzat as an NCPS employee, agreed to be botu1d by the\n       DRP and to submit all claims against the Company to arbitration. There is no question that\n       PVOG~ as an Electing Entity, is a member of the Company and is, therefore, entitled to the\n       bene·fits of the DRP. Thls lawsuit clearly arises out of Mr. De La Garza's employment with\n       NCPS and he has filed a claim against the Company. Therefore, the DRP is applicable to this\n       matter. Accordingly, PVOG fonnally requests that you dismiss the present civil suit against it\n       and initiate the claim in arbitration. Should you fail to voluntarily do so., we are prepared to\n       proceed with a Motion to Compel Arbitration and will seek to abate the claims against PVOG\n       pending resolution of the Motion to CompeL\n\f04/20/2015 MON    18~33     FAX     44 4   John David Hart                                                               il!004/040\n\n\n\n                           GALLOWAY\n                           JOHNSON\n\n        GjiBs              TOMPKINS\n                           BURR AND\n                           SMITH\n\n                               Texas • Louisiana • M16sourl • MISsissippi • Alabama • Florida • Georgia\n       Mr. .John Hart\n       PageJ\n\n\n                 We look forward to receiving your response.

Appellees\n\n   are Alfredo De La Garza, individually and as next friend for XXXXXX XX XX XXXXX AND\n\n   XXXXXXXX XX XX XXXXX, minors.\n\n2. Appellants filed their Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate on June 18, 2015. A copy of\n\n   that motion is attached as Exhibit \"A\". Appellees filed their response to appellants' Motion\n\n   to Compel Arbitration and to Abate on July 30, 2015. A copy of that response is attached as\n\n   Exhibit \"B\". On August 26, 2015, appellees filed their First Amended Response to appellants'\n\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. A copy of this amended response is attached as\n\n   \"Exhibit \"C\". On September 10, 2015, appellants filed their reply to appellees' Response to\n\n   Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. A copy of appellants' reply is attached as Exhibit\n\n   \"D\". On September 11, 2015, appellees filed their first supplement to their First Amended\n\n   Response to appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate.            A copy of this\n\n   supplement is attached as Exhibit \"E\".       The hearing on appellants' Motion to Compel\n\n   Arbitration and to Abate was initially set on July 31,2015, but was reset at appellees' request\n\n   for September 11,2015 with agreement of counsel for appellants. On September 11,2015, the\n\n   trial court heard appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. Appellants' Motion\n\n   to Compel Arbitration and to Abate was denied by order dated September 11, 2015. See\n\n   Exhibit \"F\".\n\n3. Appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration\n\n   on October 1, 2015. A copy of this motion is attached as Exhibit \"G\". Appellees opposed\n\n   this motion and objected to the. affidavit of Ernest Nelson, attached to appellants' Motion for\n\n   Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration. A copy of appellees'\n\f   response is attached as Exhibit \"H\". On October 9, 2015, appellants filed their reply to\n\n   appellees' Response to Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to Compel\n\n   Arbitration. A copy of appellants' reply is attached as Exhibit \"1\". The Hon. Elaine Palmer,\n\n   Judge of the 215th District Court denied appellants' Motion for Reconsideration of Order\n\n   Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration on October 12, 2015. A copy of the order is attached\n\n   as Exhibit \"J\".\n\n4. Appellants filed their Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2015. A copy of this notice is attached\n\n   hereto as Exhibit \"K\". In appellants' Notice of Appeal, they seek to appeal the court's order\n\n   denying appellants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate signed on September 11, 2015.\n\n   Appellants also seek to appeal the order denying defendant's motion for reconsideration of the\n\n   order denying the motion to compel arbitration signed by Judge Palmer on October 12, 2015.\n\n5. On October 14, 2015, appellants filed their Motion for Extension of Time to File Notice of\n\n   Appeal.\n\n6. The notice of appeal was untimely. The facts averred to by appellants' counsel fail to\n\n   reasonably explain the need for an extension.\n\n7. The order denying appellants' Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion to\n\n   Compel Arbitration is not an appealable order.\n\n                                  Argument and Authorities\n\n8. This is an accelerated appeal pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 28.1. Perfecting the appeal is\n\n   completed by timely filing notice of appeal within 20 days pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(b)\n\n   and 26.1(b). Appellants' notice of appeal was filed 33 days after Judge Palmer's September\n\n   11, 2015 order was signed and is untimely. The notice should have been filed on October 1,\n\n   2015.\n\f9. The facts alleged in appellants' motion and supported by appellants' affidavit attached to their\n\n   motion for extension of time do not reasonably explain the need for extension as required by\n\n   Tex. R. App. P. 10.5(b)(l)(C).\n\n10. The reply filed by appellants in response to Appellees' Response to Appellants' Motion for\n\n   Extension of Time to File Notice of Appeal fails to address Thomas J. Smith's knowledge of\n\n   the deadline for filing the notice of appeal in an accelerated appeal. The verification of Kelly\n\n   C. Hartmann filed by appellants was not timely filed within fifteen days as required by Tex.\n\n   R. App. P. 26.3 and Tex. R. App. P. 10.5(b).\n\n11. Appellants also seek to appeal the October 12, 2015 order denying appellants' motion for\n\n   reconsideration of the trial court's order denying appellants' motion for arbitration and to\n\n   abate. This is a non-appealable order. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 51.016. 9 U.S.C. § 16(a).\n\n   The motion for reconsideration also did not extend the appellate timetable.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n        There is no valid agreement to arbitrate between Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza and\n\nDefendants Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC (hereinafter\n\nreferred to collectively as the Penn Virginia defendants). The incident made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit occurred on April 29, 2014 on the Welhausen A2H well in Lavaca County, Texas. The\n\nwork done between Nabors Completion & Production Services Co. (hereinafter referred to as\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's      Page 1\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\n                                         EXHIBIT \"B\"\n\f\"NCPS\"), and Penn V.irginia Oil & Gas, L.P., the operator of the well, was performed pursuant to\n\na Master Service Contract (hereinafter referred to as the \"MSC\") dated March 28, 2013. A copy\n\nof this MSC is attached as Exhibit \"A\". This MSC does not reference Nabors Industries, Inc.'s\n\nDispute Resolution Program (hereinafter referred to as the \"DRP\"), and does not provide that either\n\nPenn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. or Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC is an \"electing entity\" or would\n\nparticipate in Nabors Industries,    Inc~'s   DRP. A copy of the DRP is attached as Exhibit \"B\". The\n\nPenn Virginia defendants' argument that Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil &\n\nGas GP LLC are \"electing entity[ies ]\"under the DRP is not a valid argument. The Penn Virginia\n\ndefendants rely on a 2008 drilling contract between Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Nabors\n\nDrilling USA, LP for a well in Jefferson County, Texas, attached as Exhibit \"C\", and a 2010\n\ndrilling contract between Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC and Nabors Drilling USA, LP for a well\n\nin Oklahoma, attached as Exhibit \"D\", as the basis for their argument that they were an \"electing\n\nentity\" under the Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP. Both of these contracts were only valid for the\n\nterm for completion of operations for drilling those wells. Those contracts did not control any of\n\nthe work done on the Welhausen A2H well or the relationship between NCPS and the Penn\n\nVirginia entities for the work done on the Welhausen A2H well in April, 2014.\n\n        The drilling contracts relied on by the Penn Virginia defendants only apply to           \"pr~sent   and\n\nformer\" employees and applicants ofNabors' entities at the time of the contracts. Plaintiff Alfredo\n\nDe La Garza was not a \"present or former\" employee of any Nabors entity as of 2008 or 201 0, as\n\nnoted in Keith Nicholson's affidavit, attached as Exhibit \"E\".\n\n        Furthermore, arbitration cannot be compelled in this matter because claims asserted by\n\nPlaintiffs Alfredo De La do not fall within the scope of the DRP and its arbitration provisions.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants have failed to establish that Plaintiffs REDACTED                                    ,\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 2\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\fminors, are subject to any valid arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs further contend that arbitration\n\nshould not be compelled in this matter because Defendants have waived any right to compel\n\narbitration in this matter.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Penn Virginia defendants'\n\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate be denied. In the alternative, Plaintiffs request that\n\ntheir continuance of Defendants' motion be granted; that they be allowed to conduct discovery as\n\nto arbitrability; that they be allowed to participate in a full evidentiary hearing as to the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate; and that upon hearing the\n\narguments and evidence, that Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate be denied.\n\n        Plaintiffs request that their claims against Defendant Mike Ferguson and Defendant Oaks\n\nPersonnel Services, Inc. d/b/a The Oaks Group be severed from any claims against the Penn\n\nVirginia defendants and that these claims be tried on October 19, 2015. While Defendant Mike\n\nFerguson has pled for arbitration, he has not filed a motion for arbitration, a notice of arbitration,\n\nnor has he joined in the Penn Virginia defendants' motion for arbitration. Defendant Oaks\n\nPersonnel Services, Inc. d/b/a The Oaks Group has not asserted a claim or plead that it is entitled\n\nto arbitration in connection with Plaintiffs' claims.\n\n                        II. INTRODUCTION & FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        On April29, 2014, Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza was an employee ofNabors Completion\n\n& Production Services Co. (hereinafter referred to as \"NCPS\"). NCPS is a subsidiary of Nabors\n\nIndustries, Inc. On this date, Plaintiff was working on Nabors Rig No. 1480, outside of Shiner,\n\nTexas. Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. was the operator of the well and was directing workover and\n\ncompletion operations on the well.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's   Page 3\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f        The well service operations on the W elhausen A2H well were being conducted pursuant to\n\na MSC between Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and NCPS dated March 28, 2013. The MSC is\n\nattached to this response as Exhibit \"A\". By its terms, the MSC supersedes all prior agreements\n\nbetween the parties. The agreement states in part that, \"This Contract shall become effective the\n\ndate first hereinabove written and shall supersede all prior service contracts between the parties\n\nhereto with respect to new work or services commenced during the term of this Contract to be\n\nperformed in connection with this Contract.\" Exhibit \"A\", page 2. There is no reference in the\n\nMSC to Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP. The MSC does not contain an agreement that either of the\n\nPenn Virginia defendants and NCPS agree that Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. or Penn Virginia\n\nOil & Gas GP LLC will be an \"electing entity\" in Nabors Industries, Inc.'s DRP.\n\n        During the operations, there was a pressure control failure that caused senous and\n\npermanent injuries to Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza. As a result of the serious, permanent, and\n\ndisabling injuries to Plaintiff Alfredo De La Garza, minors Plaintiffs REDACTED\n\n                          have suffered a loss of consortium.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed this action against the Penn Virginia defendants on July 24. 2014. A copy\n\nof this petition is attached as Exhibit \"F\". Plaintiffs' filed their First Amended Original Petition\n\non September 8, 2014. A copy of Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Petition is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"G\". Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Original Petition on October 1, 2014. A copy is of\n\nthis petition is attached as Exhibit \"H\".\n\n        On June 18, 2015, the Penn Virginia defendants filed their Motion to Compel Arbitration\n\nand to Abate.

Because Defendants have\n\nprovided no evidence of a written agreement signed by the children, an express provision of\n\nNabors' DRP binding the children to arbitration, or the application of direct-benefits estoppel,\n\nDefendants have failed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs REDACTED                                    claims are\n\nsubject to arbitration.\n\n        Arbitration is a matter of contract and should not be compelled without an agreement.

As previously addressed, public policies favoring arbitration\n\ndo not extend to any favorable inclination one way or the other with regard to the questions of who\n\nis bound by the arbitration agreement because the purpose of the FAA is to \"make arbitration\n\nagreement as enforceable as other contracts, but not more so.\" In re SSP Partners, 241 S.W.3d at\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Response to Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, L.P. and Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP LLC's Page 14\nMotion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate\n\f167-168 (court refused to enforce an arbitration agreement in connection with claims for loss of\n\nparental consortium by minor children of an etnployee who was injured on the job and who has\n\nsigned an enforceable agreement to arbitrate all disputes relating to her employment).

Exhibit \"H\".\n\n        On August 25, 2014, the Penn Virginia defendants filed their Original Answer which was\n\nnot subject to a motion to compel arbitration. Defendants filed a First Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Amended Petition on April 10, 2015. Defendants waited until the filing of this\n\nanswer to plead in the alternative that Defendants would assert the affirmative defenses of\n\narbitration and award. On April 20, 2015, Defendants filed their Second Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs' Second Amended Petition. It was not until this answer that Defendants specifically\n\nplead that Plaintiffs' claims are \"subject to mandatory binding arbitration and as such this suit must\n\nbe abated and/or dismissed. On this same date, Defendants sent a notice of arbitration. A copy of\n\nthis notice is attached as Exhibit \"J\".\n\n        This case has been pending before this Court for over a year. Defendants waited until June\n\n18, 2015, to file their Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Abate. In the meantime, Defendants\n\nhave propounded interrogatories on Plaintiffs; submitted requests for production and requests for\n\nadmissions; participated in numerous depositions; and, responded to Plaintiffs' written discovery.\n\nDefendants did not raise the issue of arbitration in any motions, pleadings, or filings made before\n\ntheir amended answer filed on April 10, 2015. Defendants delayed in filing a motion to compel\n\narbitration until approximately four months before the date scheduled for trial of October 19, 2015.\n\nThis delay wasted judicial resources and disadvantaged Plaintiffs who are preparing for an October\n\n19, 2015 trial.

Si una de las Partes no regresara la lista dentro del\n     plazo especificado, todas las personas en 1a misma seran\n     consideradas como aceptables. Entre las personas que\n     hayan sido aprobadas en ambas Iistas, y de acuerdo con el\n     orden de preferencia mutua, AAAo JAMS deberan invitar a\n     que uno de ellos o mas de uno ejerza/n de arbitro/s.

Antes de aceptar el nombramiento, el posible\n     candidate debera revelar cualquier circunstancia que posi-\n     blemente pudiera impedir una audiencia oportuna o crear la\n     presunci6n de parcialidad. Una vez recibida dicha infor-\n     macion por parte del arbitro o de cualquier otra fuente,\n     AAA o JAMS tendra que sustituir esa persona o comu-\n     nicar 1a informaci6n a las Partes involucradas para que\n\f   puedan formular sus comentarios. A partir de entonces,\n   AAA o JAMS podnin descalificar dicha persona y su\n   decision sera concluyente.\n\n7.

After I administered an oath to affiant, the\naffiant testified:\n\nL      \"My name is Keith Nicholson. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and capable of\n       making this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge\n       and are true and correct.\n\n2..    I am Assistant General Counsel for Nabors Corporate Services, Inc.\n\n3.     In my capacity as Assistant General Counsel, I am required to be familiar with Nabors\n       Industries, Inc.'s corporate structure and the relationship of its various subsidiaries and\n       affiliated companies. I am also required to be familiar with the Nabors Dispute\n       Resolution Program (\"DRP\").\n\n4.     Nabors Industries, Inc. is the \"Sponsor\" of the Nabors DRP as that term is defmed by the\n       DRP. A true and correct copy of the DRP is attached to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-A.\n\n5...   The DRP provides that it applies to all direct and indirect subsidiaries of Nabors\n       Industries, Inc., as well as all \"Electing Entities\"· that have agreed to be bound by same.\n\n6.     Nabors Completion & Production Services Co. (\"NCPS\") was a subsidiary of Nabors\n\n\n                                                                                           EXHIBIT\n\n                                                                                     I f\n\f      Industries, Inc. at the time of the April 29, 2014 incident which makes the basis of the\n      lawsuit.\n\n7.    On September 23, 2008, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP agreed to be bound by the DRP as\n      an \"Electing Entity\" in the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" contained in the International\n      Association of Drilling Contractors (\"IADC\") Drilling Contract between it and Nabors\n      Drilling USA LP. A true and correct copy of the IADC Contract is attached in its entirety\n      to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-B. The Contractors Special Provisions portion has been\n      pulled out for reference and is attached as Exhibit 1-C.\n\n8..   The Contractors Special Provisions page states at paragraph 16 that \"Operator, its parent,\n      subsidiary, and affiliated corporations ... (collectively \"Operator\") is cognizant of the\n      Nabors Dispute Resolution Program and wishes to become an Electing Entity, as defined\n      in that Program. Accordingly, Operator and Nabors Industries, Inc. (\"Nabors\") hereby\n      agree that Operator is an Electing Entity ... \"\n\n9.:   In addition, on September 8, 2010, Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC agreed to be bound\n      by the DRP as an \"Electing Entity\" in the \"Contractors Special Provisions\" contained in\n      the International Association of Drilling Contractors (''IADC\") Drilling Contract between\n      it and Nabors Drilling USA LP. A true and correct copy of the IADC Contract is attached\n      in its entirety to my affidavit as Exhibit 1-D. The Contractors Special Provisions portion\n      has been pulled out for reference and is attached as Exhibit 1-E. It is my understanding\n      that Penn Virginia MC Energy, LLC is a subsidiary or affiliated corporation of Penn\n      Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and/or Penn Virginia Oil & Gas GP, LLC.\n\n10.   As an \"Electing Entity,\" Defendants, Penn Virginia Oil & Gas, LP and Penn Virginia Oil\n      & Gas GP, LLC are required to resolve disputes with any past or present employee(s) or\n      applicant(s) of Nabors Industries, Inc. or its subsidiaries in accordance with the DRP.\n\n11.   Based upon my review of the personnel file of Mr. Adame, I can confirm that Mr. Adan1e\n      was employed by NCPS, and that he executed various documents that acknowledged that\n      he received, reviewed, and accepted the terms and conditions of the DRP.\n\n12.   Specifically, my review of the relevant documents confirms that on January 2, 2013, Mr.\n      Adame executed a document entitled \"Application For Hourly And Daily Employment,\"\n      a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-F. Mr. Adame acknowledged\n      and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute Resolution\n      Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.\"\n\n13.   Further, on January 7, 2013, Mr. Adame executed a document entitled \"Employee\n      Acknowledgement Concerning Nabors Dispute Resolution Program,\" a true and correct\n      copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-H. The document specifically states, \"I have\n      received a copy of the Nabors Dispute Resolution Program.\" Mr. Adame acknowledged\n      and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute Resolution\n      Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.''\n\f14.   Mr. Adame was employed by NCPS as a crew worker. As a crew worker, Mr. Adame's\n      job duties and responsibilities included the operation of hand and power tools to perform\n      maintenance and repairs to oil or gas wells and related equipment. Mr. Adame's job\n      duties also involved activities associated with rigging-up and rigging-down work over\n      rigs, pulling levers or turning handles to extend hydraulic or screw-type jacks to support\n      and level the rig, laying steel production rods, tubing, and casing, and other tasks\n      necessary to support operations. While employed by NCPS, Mr. Adame was never a\n      commercial truck driver or transportation worker.\n\n15.   Based upon my review of the personnel file of Mr. Alfredo De La Garza, I can confirm\n      that Mr. De La Garza was employed by NCPS, and that he executed various documents\n      that acknowledged that he received, reviewed, and accepted the terms and conditions of\n      the DRP.\n\n16.   Specifically, my review of the relevant documents confirms that on July 16, 2013, Mr. De\n      La Garza executed a document entitled \"Application For Hourly And Daily\n      Employment,\" a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-G. By his\n      signature, Mr. De La Garza acknowledged and agreed that he is \"required to adhere to the\n      Dispute Resolution Program and its requirement for submission of all claims\n      to ... arbitration.\"\n\n17~   Further, on July 22, 2013, Mr. De La Garza executed a document entitled \"Employee\n      Acknowledgement Concerning Nabors Dispute Resolution Program,'' a true and correct\n      copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1-I. The document specifically states, \"I have\n      received a copy of the Nabors Dispute Resolution Program.\" Mr. De La Garza\n      acknowledged and agreed by his signature that he is \"required to adhere to the Dispute\n      Resolution Program and its requirement for submission of all claims to ... arbitration.\"\n\n18.   I\\1r. De La Garza was employed by NCPS as a crew worker. As a crew worker, Mr. De\n      La Garza's job duties and responsibilities included the operation of hand and power tools\n      to perform maintenance and repairs to oil or gas wells and related equipment. Mr. De La\n      Garza's job duties also involved activities associated with rigging-up and rigging-down\n      work over rigs, pulling levers or turning handles to extend hydraulic or screw-type jacks\n      to support and level the rig, laying steel production rods, tubing, and casing, and other\n      tasks necessary to support operations. Mr. De La Garza's job duties and responsibilities\n      did not include the movement of goods in interstate commerce. While employed by\n      NCPS, Mr. De La Garza was never a commercial truck driver or transportation worker.\n\n19.   At all times relevant to this matter, NCPS was engaged in interstate commerce as it was\n      in the business of providing services for the development of oil and gas resources that are\n      placed into commerce in both Texas and other states of the United States.\n\n20.   On information and belief, Penn Virginia is also engaged in interstate commerce as it is\n      in the business of producing oil and gas resources that are placed into commerce in both\n      Texas and other states of the United States.\n\f2L            Attached as Exhibit 1-A to my affidavit is a true and correct copy of Nabors Industries,\n              Inc.'s DRP booklet, in English and Spanish, respectively.

In doing so, PVOG became an HEiecting Entity\" to the DRP such that\n       Mr. De La Garza's claims against PVOG are subject to arbitration,\n\n              The DRP provides a means for the \"resolution of Disputes between the Company and the\n       Company's present and fonner Employees.\" As you will see at page 2 of the DRP, the\n       \"Company\" is defined to include Nabors Industries, Inc.~ its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and\n       Electing Entities. Because NCPS is a subsidiary of Nabors Industries, Inc.t NCPS is part of the\n       ~~company.\" Page 2 states further that parties that are Electing Entities to the DRP are also\n       included in the definition of the \"Company.\" Because PVOG is an Electing Entity to the DRPt it\n       too is part of the ''Con1pany.\" Finally) the DRP defines \"Disputeu as \"all legal and equitable\n       claims~ demands, and controversies ... whether in contract (or) tort. .. between persons bound by\n       the Program ... or between a person bound by the Program and a person or entity otherwise\n       entitled to (the P1·ogram's) benefits.\" The definition includes \"any personal injury incurred .. ,in\n       the course and scope of an Employee's employment.\"\n\n               Because Mr. De La Garza, an employee of NCPS) has filed a claim against PVOG, an\n       Electing Entity to the DRP, he has filed a claim against the ~'Company.\" Pursuant to his\n       contractual agreement to submit such clahns to the DRP, Mr. De La Garza's clain1s against\n       PVOG are subject to arbitration. The arbitration agreement between Nabors, its employees, and\n       its employees' heirs and beneficiaries has been foWld valid on numerous occasions. E.g. Nabors\n       Drilling USA, LP v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1654949\"><a href=\"/opinion/1654949/nabors-drilling-usa-lp-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2006, orig.\n       proceeding). Most recently; the San Antonio Fourth Court of Appeals found that the\n       beneficiaries of a deceased Nabors ernployee were bound by the decedent's agreement to\n       arbitrate pursuant to Nabors' DRP. Nabors Drilling USA, LP v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n       App.-San Antonio 20 12).\n\n                It is undisputed that Mr. De La Garzat as an NCPS employee, agreed to be botu1d by the\n       DRP and to submit all claims against the Company to arbitration. There is no question that\n       PVOG~ as an Electing Entity, is a member of the Company and is, therefore, entitled to the\n       bene·fits of the DRP. Thls lawsuit clearly arises out of Mr. De La Garza's employment with\n       NCPS and he has filed a claim against the Company. Therefore, the DRP is applicable to this\n       matter. Accordingly, PVOG fonnally requests that you dismiss the present civil suit against it\n       and initiate the claim in arbitration. Should you fail to voluntarily do so., we are prepared to\n       proceed with a Motion to Compel Arbitration and will seek to abate the claims against PVOG\n       pending resolution of the Motion to CompeL\n\f04/20/2015 MON    18~33     FAX     44 4   John David Hart                                                               il!004/040\n\n\n\n                           GALLOWAY\n                           JOHNSON\n\n        GjiBs              TOMPKINS\n                           BURR AND\n                           SMITH\n\n                               Texas • Louisiana • M16sourl • MISsissippi • Alabama • Florida • Georgia\n       Mr. .John Hart\n       PageJ\n\n\n                 We look forward to receiving your response.
