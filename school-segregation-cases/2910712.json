After reviewing the language of the\nconsent decree and the evidence of the parties’ intent in the\ncontext of the litigation as a whole, we conclude that the con-\nsent decree was not meant to create a perpetual floor on\nrefund annuity benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt.\n\f13122                    EBNER v. OREGON\n                        BACKGROUND\n\n                I.   PERS and Refund Annuities\n\n   PERS is a statutory retirement plan for state and local gov-\nernment employees in Oregon. Many retired PERS members\nreceive a monthly “service retirement allowance” composed\nof two parts: (1) a “refund annuity” and (2) a life pension.1\nThe amount of the refund annuity depends upon three vari-\nables: (1) life expectancy rates for persons in the retiree’s age\ngroup; (2) assumed interest rates; and (3) the size of the retir-\nee’s account balance at the time of retirement. The first two\nvariables, life expectancy and assumed interest rates, are “ac-\ntuarial equivalency factors” (“AEFs”) used to convert the\nthird variable, the retiree’s account balance at the time of\nretirement, into the monthly refund annuity. See Or. Rev. Stat.\n§ 238A.005(2).\n\n   PERS governing statutes mandate that the refund annuity\nbe “the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions, if\nany, by the member and interest thereon at the time of retire-\nment.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 238.300. Thus, to convert a sum of\nmoney to a refund annuity, the PERS actuary multiplies that\nsum of accumulated contributions by the appropriate AEF\nfrom an annuity table adopted by Oregon’s Public Employee\nRetirement Board (“Board”), the governing authority for\nPERS. For example, if a retiree had accumulated $100,000 in\ncontributions and earnings, and the appropriate AEF for that\nretiree was 8.32 per $1,000, the retiree would receive a\nmonthly refund annuity payment of $832 until death.\n\n        II.   Henderson I and the 1978 Consent Decree\n\n  In 1974, four female PERS members filed a lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Oregon against\n  1\n   Certain PERS members may opt to receive a lump-sum payment rather\nthan monthly allowances. Or. Rev. Stat. § 238.315.\n\f                       EBNER v. OREGON                   13123\nthe State of Oregon and the Board (“Henderson I”). The Hen-\nderson I plaintiffs alleged that the Board’s practice of using\ntwo sets of life expectancy tables, one for men and another for\nwomen, in calculating refund annuities for retired PERS\nmembers constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The challenged practice\nresulted in lower monthly refund annuities for female PERS\nmembers, who were actuarially shown to live longer than\ntheir male counterparts.\n\n   The district court issued an order holding that the use of\nsex-segregated life expectancy tables violated Title VII, but\nstaying any injunctive relief pending appeal. While the Hen-\nderson I appeal was pending, the United States Supreme\nCourt ruled in City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water and Power\nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), that Title VII’s prohibitions\non sex-based discrimination applied to employee benefit\nplans.\n\n  Following Manhart, the parties agreed to a settlement.\nThus, the district court vacated its order and judgment and\nentered a consent decree on September 20, 1978. The consent\ndecree provided:\n\n    1.   The judgment of this Court dated January 16,\n         1976 is set aside and this judgment is entered in\n         lieu of it.\n\n    2.   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohib-\n         its the use of sex-segregated life expectancy\n         tables in calculating “refund annuity” retirement\n         allowances of employee members of the Oregon\n         Public Employee Retirement System.\n\n    3.   Defendant Public Employee Retirement System\n         is permanently enjoined and restrained from the\n         use of sex-segregated life expectancy tables in\n         calculating “refund annuity” retirement allow-\n\f13124                  EBNER v. OREGON\n         ance prospectively only for members retiring\n         effective July 1, 1978, and thereafter, shall pro-\n         vide a monthly “refund annuity” retirement\n         allowance to female members retiring after that\n         date which is identical to the “refund annuity”\n         retirement allowance males of the same age and\n         amount received prior to that date. Defendant\n         shall have no obligation to recalculate “refund\n         annuity” retirement allowances to female mem-\n         bers already retired or retiring before July 1,\n         1978.\n\n    4.   Plaintiffs shall have and recover against defen-\n         dants costs and counsel fees in the total amount\n         of $7,000.00.\n\nThe Henderson I consent decree remains in effect today.\n\n             III.   Legislative Reforms to PERS\n\n  The Board has used gender-neutral life expectancy tables\never since the district court entered the 1978 consent decree.\nAdditionally, from 1978 through 2003, despite changing life\nexpectancy and interest rate assumptions, the Board did not\napply any updated AEFs that would have decreased a PERS\nmember’s projected monthly refund annuity.\n\n   The use of outdated AEFs, however, created unfunded lia-\nbilities for PERS. As a result, in 2003, Oregon Governor\nKulongski signed the PERS Reform and Stabilization Act of\n2003 (“Reform Legislation”). The Reform Legislation\nrequired that the Board adopt updated actuarial equivalency\ntables every two years. Accordingly, on June 10, 2003, the\nBoard adopted new annuity tables based on current AEFs to\ncalculate refund annuities for PERS members retiring after\nJuly 1, 2003.\n\f                            EBNER v. OREGON                          13125\n   The Reform Legislation provided that its constitutionality\ncould be challenged directly in the Oregon Supreme Court.\nOn March 8, 2005, the Oregon Supreme Court decided Strunk\nv. Public Employees Retirement Bd., 108 P.3d 1058 (Or.\n2005). Strunk rejected several constitutional and contractual\nchallenges to the Reform Legislation.2 Specifically, Strunk\nrejected challenges to the requirement that the Board adopt\nand use current AEFs when calculating retirement benefits.\nId. at 1109-10. Strunk further determined that the Board lacks\nthe authority to use outdated AEFs. Id. at 1110.\n\n                     IV.    Henderson II and III\n\n   On October 16, 2003, six PERS members challenged the\nBoard’s use of updated life expectancy tables by filing a new\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\nOregon (“Henderson II”). In Henderson II, the PERS mem-\nbers moved to reopen Henderson I and to hold the Board in\ncivil contempt for violating the terms of the consent decree.\nThey argued that the consent decree requires the Board “to\nprovide all PERS members, retiring thereafter, a ‘refund\nannuity’ allowance based upon the actuarial life expectancy\ntables in effect for males on July 1, 1978.” At oral argument\non June 10, 2004, the district court issued a minute order\ndenying both the motion to reopen and the motion for civil con-\ntempt.3 The Henderson II plaintiffs appealed that minute order\nto this court.\n\n  On September 16, 2004, six PERS members (including two\nHenderson II plaintiffs) filed another action in the United\n  2\n     Stunk also sustained two constitutional challenges to the Reform Legis-\nlation. Strunk, 108 P.3d at 1064. Those challenges, however, are not at\nissue here.\n   3\n     The district court did not interpret the meaning of the consent decree\nin its minute order. Instead, the district court stated at oral argument that\nthe decree lacked “sufficient clarity” to determine that it created “a floor\nof rates or benefits that would make the reform legislation in violation of\nthe decree.”\n\f13126                      EBNER v. OREGON\nStates District Court for the District of Oregon (“Henderson\nIII”). They sought to reopen Henderson I and requested a dif-\nferent remedy, a “declaration that the September 20, 1978\ninjunction requires [the Board] to adopt and use refund annu-\nity tables which grant benefits not less than those benefits\nwhich were in effect for male members of [PERS] on July 1,\n1978.” On October 25, 2004, the district court issued a minute\norder denying the motion to reopen and denying as moot the\nmotion for declaratory judgment. The Henderson III plaintiffs\nalso appealed that minute order to this court.\n\n   Henderson II and III were consolidated on appeal. On\nOctober 20, 2006, we issued a disposition addressing the\nissues raised in Henderson II and Henderson III. Henderson\nv. Oregon, 203 Fed. Appx. 45, 49-50 (9th Cir. 2006) (unpub-\nlished memorandum disposition).4 We held that the district\ncourt had not abused its discretion when it denied the motion\nfor civil contempt filed in Henderson II because “viewing the\nlanguage in the Henderson consent decree in favor of [the\nBoard] . . . the consent decree is not sufficiently specific to\ngive notice to [the Board] that it would violate the consent\ndecree by updating the actuarial tables.” Id. at 50. We further\nheld that the motions to reopen were properly denied because\nthe motions were not needed to invoke the district court’s\ncontinuing jurisdiction over the Henderson I consent decree.\nId. at 52.\n\n   However, we also held that the district court had improp-\nerly denied as moot the motion for declaratory judgment filed\nin Henderson III because the district court had never actually\ninterpreted the language of the consent decree. Id. at 50-51.\nAccordingly, the panel remanded the Henderson litigation to\nthe district court for a ruling on the meaning of the consent\ndecree.\n  4\n    The 2006 memorandum disposition refers to the Henderson II plain-\ntiffs as the Santacroce-Appellants and the Henderson III plaintiffs as the\nEbner-Appellants.\n\f                        EBNER v. OREGON                    13127\n                     V.   Current Appeal\n\n   On remand, the parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment regarding the correct interpretation of the consent\ndecree. On April 18, 2007, the district court issued an order\ndenying the PERS members’ summary judgment motion and\ngranting the Board’s summary judgment motion. Henderson\nv. Oregon, 2007 WL 1187978 (D. Or. Apr. 18, 2007). The\ndistrict court held that the text of the consent degree was\nambiguous, id. at *5, but that extrinsic evidence of the parties’\nintent demonstrated that the consent decree “does not require\n[the Board] to use refund annuity tables which grant benefits\nno less than the benefits in effect for males on July 1, 1978,”\nid. at *8. The district court also struck certain paragraphs from\naffidavits filed in support of the PERS members’ summary\njudgment motion.\n\n  On May 15, 2007, the PERS members filed their timely\nnotice of appeal.\n\n                       JURISDICTION\n\n The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review de novo a district court’s decision on cross\nmotions for summary judgment. See Arakaki v. Hawaii, 314\nF.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2002). On appeal, we must deter-\nmine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and whether the district court correctly applied\nthe relevant substantive law. See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of\nMedicine, 363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n  We review the district court’s evidentiary rulings for an\nabuse of discretion. Tritchler v. County of Lake, 358 F.3d\n1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\f13128                     EBNER v. OREGON\n                           DISCUSSION\n\n   I.     The Consent Decree Does Not Require a Perpetual\n        Floor on Benefits Measured by the Refund Annuity\n           Allowance Rates in Effect for Males in 1978\n\n   [1] Our main task on appeal is to construe the consent\ndecree. “Because a consent decree has attributes of both a\ncontract and a judicial act, courts use contract principles in\nconstruing it.” Washington v. Penwell, 700 F.2d 570, 573 (9th\nCir. 1983) (internal citation omitted), abrogated on other\ngrounds as recognized by Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, 365 F.3d\n844, 852 (9th Cir. 2004). Here, the parties entered into the\nconsent decree in Oregon. Therefore, Oregon law on contract\ninterpretation applies. Gates v. Gomez, 60 F.3d 525, 530 (9th\nCir. 1995) (“A consent decree is construed with reference to\nordinary contract principles of the state in which the decree is\nsigned.”).\n\n   [2] Oregon courts follow three steps when interpreting con-\ntractual provisions. First, they examine “the text of the dis-\nputed provision, in the context of the document as a whole.”\nYogman v. Parrott, 937 P.2d 1019, 1021 (Or. 1997). “If the\nprovision is clear, the analysis ends.” Id. However, if the con-\ntractual provision at issue is ambiguous, Oregon courts follow\nthe second step of “examin[ing] extrinsic evidence of the con-\ntracting parties’ intent.” Id. at 1022. If the second step fails to\nresolve the ambiguity, Oregon courts rely on “appropriate\nmaxims of construction.” Id.\n\n                  A.   Text of the Consent Decree\n\n   [3] We turn first to the text of the consent decree, viewed\nin the context of the document as a whole. The third para-\ngraph of the consent decree contains the disputed provision:\n\n        3.   Defendant Public Employee Retirement System\n             is permanently enjoined and restrained from the\n\f                            EBNER v. OREGON                          13129\n          use of sex-segregated life expectancy tables in\n          calculating “refund annuity” retirement allow-\n          ance prospectively only for members retiring\n          effective July 1, 1978, and thereafter, shall pro-\n          vide a monthly “refund annuity” retirement\n          allowance to female members retiring after that\n          date which is identical to the “refund annuity”\n          retirement allowance males of the same age and\n          amount received prior to that date. Defendant\n          shall have no obligation to recalculate “refund\n          annuity” retirement allowances to female mem-\n          bers already retired or retiring before July 1,\n          1978.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n   The PERS members argue that the disputed provision\nmeans that, from the date of the consent decree onward, all\nPERS members were entitled to receive refund annuity allow-\nances in the same amount as those received by male PERS\nmembers before 1978. Thus, the PERS members believe that\nthe consent decree created a perpetual “floor” on benefits.5\nThey argue that the “thereafter” clause is superfluous if it is\nnot interpreted to create a benefits floor.\n\n   By contrast, the Board argues that the disputed provision\nmeans that, from the date of the consent decree onward, all\nsimilarly situated male and female PERS members were enti-\ntled to receive identical refund annuity allowances. The Board\ncontends that the “thereafter” clause memorializes the\nBoard’s decision to “top up” (i.e., raise) female allowances on\nJuly 1, 1978 to the male allowance levels in effect prior to\nthat date; the clause does not demonstrate an agreement\nbetween the parties to lock in a permanent allowance rate.\n  5\n    Notably, the PERS members do not argue that the consent decree also\ncreated a “ceiling” on benefits. In other words, the PERS members would\nlike us to read the term “identical” as used in the decree to mean “not less\nthan.” We are unwilling to do so.\n\f13130                      EBNER v. OREGON\n   As we previously stated in our 2006 memorandum disposi-\ntion, given the Title VII context of this case, both parties’\nconstructions of the disputed provision are arguably plausible.\nThere, we explained:\n\n      The “prior to that date” language of the Henderson\n      consent decree to a degree supports [the] argument\n      that the consent decree literally established a floor\n      for female employee refund annuity tables. But taken\n      in its context, a Title VII claim of sex discrimination,\n      in which parity on payments to men and women was\n      the goal, the consent order’s prohibition might be\n      read only to order PERB to stop using segregated\n      actuarial tables, and from July 1, 1978, onward, to\n      use identical refund annuity tables for women and\n      men.\n\n203 Fed. Appx. at 49-50.6\n\n   [4] Because the disputed provision is susceptible to at least\ntwo plausible interpretations when examined in the context of\nthe contract as a whole, it is legally ambiguous. Moon v.\nMoon, 914 P.2d 1133, 1135 (Or. 1996). Therefore, we pro-\nceed to the extrinsic evidence analysis.\n\n         B.    Extrinsic Evidence of the Parties’ Intent\n\n   The PERS members make two main arguments that the\nextrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent supports their interpre-\ntation of the consent decree. We address those arguments in\nturn.\n  6\n   As noted above, we did not actually interpret the consent decree; we\nonly identified the decree as ambiguous for purposes of our ruling on con-\ntempt.\n\f                         EBNER v. OREGON                   13131\n                    1.   Retroactive Relief\n\n   The PERS members first argue that the consent decree\nembodied a “quid pro quo” exchange of their rights to retroac-\ntive relief under Title VII in return for a permanent benefits\nfloor. In support of this argument, they point to the last sen-\ntence of paragraph three of the consent decree:\n\n    Defendant shall have no obligation to recalculate\n    “refund annuity” retirement allowances to female\n    members already retired or retiring before July 1,\n    1978.\n\nThe PERS members maintain that this sentence was included\nin the consent decree to memorialize the parties’ exchange of\nrights.\n\n   The Board argues that no such exchange of rights was con-\ntemplated by this sentence. Instead, the sentence was merely\nintended to clarify the scope of relief. The Board also argues\nthat the original Henderson litigants did not have any such\nrights to retroactive relief, and, even if they did, the Board\nwould not have opted to create a permanent benefits floor to\navoid paying retroactive relief.\n\n   To understand these arguments, we turn to the state of Title\nVII case law in 1978. The parties entered into the consent\ndecree after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Man-\nhart. The Court held for the first time in Manhart that Title\nVII’s prohibitions on sex-based discrimination applied to\nemployee benefit plans. Nevertheless, the Court reversed the\ndistrict court’s award of retroactive relief to the retirees, rea-\nsoning that “retroactive liability could be devastating for a\npension fund” because the “harm would fall in large part on\ninnocent third parties.” 435 U.S. at 723.\n\n [5] When viewed from hindsight, the timing and holding of\nManhart suggest that the original Henderson plaintiffs would\n\f13132                   EBNER v. OREGON\nnot have believed that they were entitled to retroactive relief.\nBut in 1978, Manhart was new law, and Title VII case law on\nretroactivity was not uniform. Moreover, it was not entirely\nclear that Manhart’s holding on retroactivity applied to the\nfacts of the Henderson litigation. Thus, it is theoretically pos-\nsible that the parties were concerned about retroactive relief\nwhen drafting the 1978 consent decree. However, this does\nnot necessarily mean that any quid pro quo arrangement with\nrespect to a permanent refund annuity allowance rate was\nreached.\n\n   [6] Therefore, we look to the evidence in the record. The\nPERS members contend that the assumptions of the Board\nand its intent on retroactivity are revealed by the briefs filed\nin Henderson I, the district court’s pre-Manhart decision in\nHenderson I, the understandings of the parties as expressed by\nminutes from the Board’s 1978 meeting about the consent\ndecree, the affidavit of the 1978 PERS Director, the affidavit\nof the 1978 PERS Assistant Director, and the Affidavit of\nPERS counsel.\n\n   [7] Our review of this evidence, however, reveals that it\ndoes not support the PERS members’ contention. There is\nnothing in the Henderson I briefs, the district court’s pre-\nManhart decision, or the various affidavits that indicates the\nparties believed that the PERS members were waiving any\nrights they may have had to retroactive relief in exchange for\na permanent floor on refund annuity rates. By contrast, the\nminutes from the 1978 meeting actually support the Board’s\nposition. At that meeting, the Board discussed whether to give\nfemale PERS members the same benefits as male PERS mem-\nbers, or whether to adopt an average between the male and\nfemale rates. The Board’s attorney “questioned the legality of\nsuch a reduction in benefits” for male members. Then, “[t]o\nresolve the matter the Board directed [the attorney] to attempt\na negotiated consent judgment with the plaintiffs, agree to\nincrease the female annuity factor to that of the male rate\neffective July 1, 1978 and thereafter.” Later in that same\n\f                           EBNER v. OREGON                         13133\nmeeting, the Board acted to top up female benefits by passing\na motion that “the refund annuity benefit for females be equal\nto that received by the males.” This language makes it clear\nthat the reason the Board chose to top-up female benefits was\nits concern over a reduction in male benefits, and not a con-\ncern about retroactive damages.7 This language also indicates\nthat the Board’s goal was to equalize male and female rates\nfrom 1978 onward. Tellingly, the minutes say nothing about\nlocking in the 1978 rates.\n\n   Finally, as the district court recognized, “[e]ven if the set-\ntlement released retroactive liability in exchange for topping\nup the tables for female members, that does not mean that the\nnewly topped-up benefit was to act as a floor in perpetuity.”\nThe Board had two options available to desegregate its refund\nannuity allowance system: (1) it could create blended rates, or\n(2) it could “top up” the female rates. “Topping up” the\nfemale rates was the best option for the PERS members. Thus,\neven if PERS members did consciously abandon any rights to\nretroactive relief, they may have decided to do so in return for\nthe “topping up” option, not the creation of a permanent bene-\nfits floor.\n\n   [8] In short, we find that, even viewing the evidence on\nretroactive relief in the light most favorable to the PERS\nmembers, the parties did not intend to create a permanent\nfloor on benefits by entering into the consent decree.\n\n                      2.    Course of Conduct\n\n  The PERS members also argue that the Board’s course of\nconduct after 1978 supports their interpretation of the consent\ndecree. Again, we disagree.\n  7\n    Indeed, the only mention of retroactive damages appears in the minutes\ntwo paragraphs earlier in connection with a discussion of the possibility\nof fighting the appeal—not in connection with negotiation of the consent\ndecree.\n\f13134                   EBNER v. OREGON\n   [9] It is undisputed that, from the date of the consent decree\nuntil the Reform Legislation was enacted in 2003, the Board\nmaintained refund annuity rates at or above those in effect for\nmales on July 1, 1978, at least for those members who joined\nPERS prior to 1999. The PERS members contend that the\nBoard’s practice of maintaining annuity rates at those levels\nsuggests that the Board believed that lowering rates would\nviolate the consent decree. However, as discussed above, the\nminutes from the Board meeting suggest that the Board’s\nrefusal to lower annuity rates was attributed to a fear that\nmale PERS members might have vested property rights in the\n1978 rates—not to a fear that lowering the rates would violate\nthe consent decree. Moreover, as the Oregon Supreme Court\nexplained in Strunk, the Board adopted administrative rules in\nthe 1990s to maintain the rates at or above the 1978 levels “in\nresponse to legal advice that it had received regarding main-\ntaining the fund’s status as a qualified governmental retire-\nment plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code.” Strunk,\n108 P.3d at 1106. Finally, there is no contemporaneous docu-\nmentary evidence indicating that, when the Board modified\nthe rates in the years following entry of the consent decree, it\nwas concerned about a benefits floor deriving from the con-\nsent decree.\n\n   [10] In sum, we find that the Board’s continued use of the\n1978 male annuity refund rates cannot be attributed to its fear\nof violating the consent decree. To the contrary, the evidence\nsuggests that the Board did not dip below the 1978 rates due\nto other, unrelated legal concerns.\n\n                        C.   Conclusion\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the extrinsic evi-\ndence of the parties’ intent demonstrates that the consent\ndecree was intended only as a remedy for sex discrimination\nin the calculation of refund annuity payments.\n\n  We note that the overall context of this case plays an\nimportant role in our decision. This case began as a Title VII\n\f                         EBNER v. OREGON                       13135\nlawsuit. The Henderson I plaintiffs filed the suit to end\nPERB’s practice of using sex-segregated refund annuity rates\n—not to establish that all PERS members were entitled to a\nminimum level of benefits. It is highly unlikely that the par-\nties intended to create a permanent floor on refund annuity\nrates when they stipulated to the consent decree. It is much\nmore likely that they decided to equalize the rates from 1978\nonward, and tried to draft the consent decree to that effect.\n\n  Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s summary judg-\nment order on the meaning of the consent decree.\n\nII. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When\n   It Struck Certain Paragraphs From the PERS Members’\n                Summary Judgment Affidavits\n\n   Finally, we address the PERS members’ two challenges to\nthe district court’s evidentiary rulings on summary judgment.\nTo reverse on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, the\ncourt must conclude not only that the district court abused its\ndiscretion, but also that the error was prejudicial. Tritchler v.\nCounty of Lake, 358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   First, the PERS members challenge the district court’s\nrefusal to consider paragraphs two through four, and parts of\nparagraph seven, of the affidavit of former PERS attorney\nWilliam Hoelscher. However, as the district court correctly\nnoted, paragraphs two through four of the affidavit, which\ndescribed the holdings of Henderson I and Manhart, merely\nstated legal conclusions. Moreover, the language stricken\nfrom paragraph seven contained improper speculation about\nthe judge’s understanding of the case. Thus, the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in deciding that these paragraphs\nwere not admissible summary judgment evidence.\n\n  Second, the PERS members challenge the district court’s\ndecision to strike paragraphs four, six, and eight8 of the virtu-\n  8\n   Paragraphs six and eight were misnumbered — they are actually para-\ngraphs five and six.\n\f13136                   EBNER v. OREGON\nally identical affidavits submitted by the former PERS Direc-\ntor and Assistant Director. These paragraphs described the\nnegotiations that occurred at the 1978 Board meeting. The\ndistrict court struck the paragraphs because they lacked any\nfacts demonstrating that the PERS Director or Assistant\nDirector were actually at that meeting. The affiants’ assertions\nabout a meeting which they apparently did not attend and\nabout which they had no personal knowledge are not the\nproper subject of an affidavit. Thus, the district court also did\nnot abuse its discretion in striking these paragraphs.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n   The consent decree was intended to ensure that male and\nfemale PERS members who had the same balances in their\nPERS accounts at the time of retirement would receive identi-\ncal refund annuities from the date of the consent decree\nonward. The consent decree was not meant to lock in the 1978\nrefund annuity rates. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

After reviewing the language of the\nconsent decree and the evidence of the parties’ intent in the\ncontext of the litigation as a whole, we conclude that the con-\nsent decree was not meant to create a perpetual floor on\nrefund annuity benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt.\n\f13122                    EBNER v. OREGON\n                        BACKGROUND\n\n                I.   PERS and Refund Annuities\n\n   PERS is a statutory retirement plan for state and local gov-\nernment employees in Oregon. Many retired PERS members\nreceive a monthly “service retirement allowance” composed\nof two parts: (1) a “refund annuity” and (2) a life pension.1\nThe amount of the refund annuity depends upon three vari-\nables: (1) life expectancy rates for persons in the retiree’s age\ngroup; (2) assumed interest rates; and (3) the size of the retir-\nee’s account balance at the time of retirement. The first two\nvariables, life expectancy and assumed interest rates, are “ac-\ntuarial equivalency factors” (“AEFs”) used to convert the\nthird variable, the retiree’s account balance at the time of\nretirement, into the monthly refund annuity. See Or. Rev. Stat.\n§ 238A.005(2).\n\n   PERS governing statutes mandate that the refund annuity\nbe “the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions, if\nany, by the member and interest thereon at the time of retire-\nment.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 238.300. Thus, to convert a sum of\nmoney to a refund annuity, the PERS actuary multiplies that\nsum of accumulated contributions by the appropriate AEF\nfrom an annuity table adopted by Oregon’s Public Employee\nRetirement Board (“Board”), the governing authority for\nPERS. For example, if a retiree had accumulated $100,000 in\ncontributions and earnings, and the appropriate AEF for that\nretiree was 8.32 per $1,000, the retiree would receive a\nmonthly refund annuity payment of $832 until death.\n\n        II.   Henderson I and the 1978 Consent Decree\n\n  In 1974, four female PERS members filed a lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Oregon against\n  1\n   Certain PERS members may opt to receive a lump-sum payment rather\nthan monthly allowances. Or. Rev. Stat. § 238.315.\n\f                       EBNER v. OREGON                   13123\nthe State of Oregon and the Board (“Henderson I”). The Hen-\nderson I plaintiffs alleged that the Board’s practice of using\ntwo sets of life expectancy tables, one for men and another for\nwomen, in calculating refund annuities for retired PERS\nmembers constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The challenged practice\nresulted in lower monthly refund annuities for female PERS\nmembers, who were actuarially shown to live longer than\ntheir male counterparts.\n\n   The district court issued an order holding that the use of\nsex-segregated life expectancy tables violated Title VII, but\nstaying any injunctive relief pending appeal. While the Hen-\nderson I appeal was pending, the United States Supreme\nCourt ruled in City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water and Power\nv. Manhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109834\"><a href=\"/opinion/109834/los-angeles-dept-of-water-and-power-v-manhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), that Title VII’s prohibitions\non sex-based discrimination applied to employee benefit\nplans.\n\n  Following Manhart, the parties agreed to a settlement.\nThus, the district court vacated its order and judgment and\nentered a consent decree on September 20, 1978. The consent\ndecree provided:\n\n    1.   The judgment of this Court dated January 16,\n         1976 is set aside and this judgment is entered in\n         lieu of it.\n\n    2.   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohib-\n         its the use of sex-segregated life expectancy\n         tables in calculating “refund annuity” retirement\n         allowances of employee members of the Oregon\n         Public Employee Retirement System.\n\n    3.

OREGON\n         ance prospectively only for members retiring\n         effective July 1, 1978, and thereafter, shall pro-\n         vide a monthly “refund annuity” retirement\n         allowance to female members retiring after that\n         date which is identical to the “refund annuity”\n         retirement allowance males of the same age and\n         amount received prior to that date. Defendant\n         shall have no obligation to recalculate “refund\n         annuity” retirement allowances to female mem-\n         bers already retired or retiring before July 1,\n         1978.\n\n    4.   Plaintiffs shall have and recover against defen-\n         dants costs and counsel fees in the total amount\n         of $7,000.00.\n\nThe Henderson I consent decree remains in effect today.\n\n             III.   Legislative Reforms to PERS\n\n  The Board has used gender-neutral life expectancy tables\never since the district court entered the 1978 consent decree.\nAdditionally, from 1978 through 2003, despite changing life\nexpectancy and interest rate assumptions, the Board did not\napply any updated AEFs that would have decreased a PERS\nmember’s projected monthly refund annuity.\n\n   The use of outdated AEFs, however, created unfunded lia-\nbilities for PERS. As a result, in 2003, Oregon Governor\nKulongski signed the PERS Reform and Stabilization Act of\n2003 (“Reform Legislation”). The Reform Legislation\nrequired that the Board adopt updated actuarial equivalency\ntables every two years. Accordingly, on June 10, 2003, the\nBoard adopted new annuity tables based on current AEFs to\ncalculate refund annuities for PERS members retiring after\nJuly 1, 2003.\n\f                            EBNER v. OREGON                          13125\n   The Reform Legislation provided that its constitutionality\ncould be challenged directly in the Oregon Supreme Court.\nOn March 8, 2005, the Oregon Supreme Court decided Strunk\nv. Public Employees Retirement Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835784\"><a href=\"/opinion/835784/strunk-v-perb/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Or.\n2005). Strunk rejected several constitutional and contractual\nchallenges to the Reform Legislation.2 Specifically, Strunk\nrejected challenges to the requirement that the Board adopt\nand use current AEFs when calculating retirement benefits.\nId. at 1109-10. Strunk further determined that the Board lacks\nthe authority to use outdated AEFs. Id. at 1110.\n\n                     IV.    Henderson II and III\n\n   On October 16, 2003, six PERS members challenged the\nBoard’s use of updated life expectancy tables by filing a new\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\nOregon (“Henderson II”). In Henderson II, the PERS mem-\nbers moved to reopen Henderson I and to hold the Board in\ncivil contempt for violating the terms of the consent decree.\nThey argued that the consent decree requires the Board “to\nprovide all PERS members, retiring thereafter, a ‘refund\nannuity’ allowance based upon the actuarial life expectancy\ntables in effect for males on July 1, 1978.” At oral argument\non June 10, 2004, the district court issued a minute order\ndenying both the motion to reopen and the motion for civil con-\ntempt.3 The Henderson II plaintiffs appealed that minute order\nto this court.\n\n  On September 16, 2004, six PERS members (including two\nHenderson II plaintiffs) filed another action in the United\n  2\n     Stunk also sustained two constitutional challenges to the Reform Legis-\nlation. Strunk, 108 P.3d at 1064. Those challenges, however, are not at\nissue here.\n   3\n     The district court did not interpret the meaning of the consent decree\nin its minute order. Instead, the district court stated at oral argument that\nthe decree lacked “sufficient clarity” to determine that it created “a floor\nof rates or benefits that would make the reform legislation in violation of\nthe decree.”\n\f13126                      EBNER v. OREGON\nStates District Court for the District of Oregon (“Henderson\nIII”). They sought to reopen Henderson I and requested a dif-\nferent remedy, a “declaration that the September 20, 1978\ninjunction requires [the Board] to adopt and use refund annu-\nity tables which grant benefits not less than those benefits\nwhich were in effect for male members of [PERS] on July 1,\n1978.” On October 25, 2004, the district court issued a minute\norder denying the motion to reopen and denying as moot the\nmotion for declaratory judgment. The Henderson III plaintiffs\nalso appealed that minute order to this court.\n\n   Henderson II and III were consolidated on appeal. On\nOctober 20, 2006, we issued a disposition addressing the\nissues raised in Henderson II and Henderson III. Henderson\nv. Oregon, 203 Fed. Appx. 45, 49-50 (9th Cir. 2006) (unpub-\nlished memorandum disposition).4 We held that the district\ncourt had not abused its discretion when it denied the motion\nfor civil contempt filed in Henderson II because “viewing the\nlanguage in the Henderson consent decree in favor of [the\nBoard] . . . the consent decree is not sufficiently specific to\ngive notice to [the Board] that it would violate the consent\ndecree by updating the actuarial tables.” Id. at 50. We further\nheld that the motions to reopen were properly denied because\nthe motions were not needed to invoke the district court’s\ncontinuing jurisdiction over the Henderson I consent decree.\nId. at 52.\n\n   However, we also held that the district court had improp-\nerly denied as moot the motion for declaratory judgment filed\nin Henderson III because the district court had never actually\ninterpreted the language of the consent decree. Id. at 50-51.\nAccordingly, the panel remanded the Henderson litigation to\nthe district court for a ruling on the meaning of the consent\ndecree.\n  4\n    The 2006 memorandum disposition refers to the Henderson II plain-\ntiffs as the Santacroce-Appellants and the Henderson III plaintiffs as the\nEbner-Appellants.\n\f                        EBNER v. OREGON                    13127\n                     V.   Current Appeal\n\n   On remand, the parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment regarding the correct interpretation of the consent\ndecree. On April 18, 2007, the district court issued an order\ndenying the PERS members’ summary judgment motion and\ngranting the Board’s summary judgment motion. Henderson\nv. Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1187978</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Or.

If the second step fails to\nresolve the ambiguity, Oregon courts rely on “appropriate\nmaxims of construction.” Id.\n\n                  A.   Text of the Consent Decree\n\n   [3] We turn first to the text of the consent decree, viewed\nin the context of the document as a whole. The third para-\ngraph of the consent decree contains the disputed provision:\n\n        3.   Defendant Public Employee Retirement System\n             is permanently enjoined and restrained from the\n\f                            EBNER v. OREGON                          13129\n          use of sex-segregated life expectancy tables in\n          calculating “refund annuity” retirement allow-\n          ance prospectively only for members retiring\n          effective July 1, 1978, and thereafter, shall pro-\n          vide a monthly “refund annuity” retirement\n          allowance to female members retiring after that\n          date which is identical to the “refund annuity”\n          retirement allowance males of the same age and\n          amount received prior to that date. Defendant\n          shall have no obligation to recalculate “refund\n          annuity” retirement allowances to female mem-\n          bers already retired or retiring before July 1,\n          1978.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n   The PERS members argue that the disputed provision\nmeans that, from the date of the consent decree onward, all\nPERS members were entitled to receive refund annuity allow-\nances in the same amount as those received by male PERS\nmembers before 1978. Thus, the PERS members believe that\nthe consent decree created a perpetual “floor” on benefits.5\nThey argue that the “thereafter” clause is superfluous if it is\nnot interpreted to create a benefits floor.\n\n   By contrast, the Board argues that the disputed provision\nmeans that, from the date of the consent decree onward, all\nsimilarly situated male and female PERS members were enti-\ntled to receive identical refund annuity allowances. The Board\ncontends that the “thereafter” clause memorializes the\nBoard’s decision to “top up” (i.e., raise) female allowances on\nJuly 1, 1978 to the male allowance levels in effect prior to\nthat date; the clause does not demonstrate an agreement\nbetween the parties to lock in a permanent allowance rate.\n  5\n    Notably, the PERS members do not argue that the consent decree also\ncreated a “ceiling” on benefits. In other words, the PERS members would\nlike us to read the term “identical” as used in the decree to mean “not less\nthan.” We are unwilling to do so.\n\f13130                      EBNER v. OREGON\n   As we previously stated in our 2006 memorandum disposi-\ntion, given the Title VII context of this case, both parties’\nconstructions of the disputed provision are arguably plausible.\nThere, we explained:\n\n      The “prior to that date” language of the Henderson\n      consent decree to a degree supports [the] argument\n      that the consent decree literally established a floor\n      for female employee refund annuity tables. But taken\n      in its context, a Title VII claim of sex discrimination,\n      in which parity on payments to men and women was\n      the goal, the consent order’s prohibition might be\n      read only to order PERB to stop using segregated\n      actuarial tables, and from July 1, 1978, onward, to\n      use identical refund annuity tables for women and\n      men.\n\n203 Fed. Appx. at 49-50.6\n\n   [4] Because the disputed provision is susceptible to at least\ntwo plausible interpretations when examined in the context of\nthe contract as a whole, it is legally ambiguous.

Therefore, we pro-\nceed to the extrinsic evidence analysis.\n\n         B.    Extrinsic Evidence of the Parties’ Intent\n\n   The PERS members make two main arguments that the\nextrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent supports their interpre-\ntation of the consent decree. We address those arguments in\nturn.\n  6\n   As noted above, we did not actually interpret the consent decree; we\nonly identified the decree as ambiguous for purposes of our ruling on con-\ntempt.\n\f                         EBNER v. OREGON                   13131\n                    1.   Retroactive Relief\n\n   The PERS members first argue that the consent decree\nembodied a “quid pro quo” exchange of their rights to retroac-\ntive relief under Title VII in return for a permanent benefits\nfloor. In support of this argument, they point to the last sen-\ntence of paragraph three of the consent decree:\n\n    Defendant shall have no obligation to recalculate\n    “refund annuity” retirement allowances to female\n    members already retired or retiring before July 1,\n    1978.\n\nThe PERS members maintain that this sentence was included\nin the consent decree to memorialize the parties’ exchange of\nrights.\n\n   The Board argues that no such exchange of rights was con-\ntemplated by this sentence. Instead, the sentence was merely\nintended to clarify the scope of relief. The Board also argues\nthat the original Henderson litigants did not have any such\nrights to retroactive relief, and, even if they did, the Board\nwould not have opted to create a permanent benefits floor to\navoid paying retroactive relief.\n\n   To understand these arguments, we turn to the state of Title\nVII case law in 1978. The parties entered into the consent\ndecree after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Man-\nhart. The Court held for the first time in Manhart that Title\nVII’s prohibitions on sex-based discrimination applied to\nemployee benefit plans. Nevertheless, the Court reversed the\ndistrict court’s award of retroactive relief to the retirees, rea-\nsoning that “retroactive liability could be devastating for a\npension fund” because the “harm would fall in large part on\ninnocent third parties.” 435 U.S. at 723.\n\n [5] When viewed from hindsight, the timing and holding of\nManhart suggest that the original Henderson plaintiffs would\n\f13132                   EBNER v. OREGON\nnot have believed that they were entitled to retroactive relief.\nBut in 1978, Manhart was new law, and Title VII case law on\nretroactivity was not uniform. Moreover, it was not entirely\nclear that Manhart’s holding on retroactivity applied to the\nfacts of the Henderson litigation. Thus, it is theoretically pos-\nsible that the parties were concerned about retroactive relief\nwhen drafting the 1978 consent decree. However, this does\nnot necessarily mean that any quid pro quo arrangement with\nrespect to a permanent refund annuity allowance rate was\nreached.\n\n   [6] Therefore, we look to the evidence in the record. The\nPERS members contend that the assumptions of the Board\nand its intent on retroactivity are revealed by the briefs filed\nin Henderson I, the district court’s pre-Manhart decision in\nHenderson I, the understandings of the parties as expressed by\nminutes from the Board’s 1978 meeting about the consent\ndecree, the affidavit of the 1978 PERS Director, the affidavit\nof the 1978 PERS Assistant Director, and the Affidavit of\nPERS counsel.\n\n   [7] Our review of this evidence, however, reveals that it\ndoes not support the PERS members’ contention. There is\nnothing in the Henderson I briefs, the district court’s pre-\nManhart decision, or the various affidavits that indicates the\nparties believed that the PERS members were waiving any\nrights they may have had to retroactive relief in exchange for\na permanent floor on refund annuity rates. By contrast, the\nminutes from the 1978 meeting actually support the Board’s\nposition. At that meeting, the Board discussed whether to give\nfemale PERS members the same benefits as male PERS mem-\nbers, or whether to adopt an average between the male and\nfemale rates. The Board’s attorney “questioned the legality of\nsuch a reduction in benefits” for male members. Then, “[t]o\nresolve the matter the Board directed [the attorney] to attempt\na negotiated consent judgment with the plaintiffs, agree to\nincrease the female annuity factor to that of the male rate\neffective July 1, 1978 and thereafter.” Later in that same\n\f                           EBNER v. OREGON                         13133\nmeeting, the Board acted to top up female benefits by passing\na motion that “the refund annuity benefit for females be equal\nto that received by the males.” This language makes it clear\nthat the reason the Board chose to top-up female benefits was\nits concern over a reduction in male benefits, and not a con-\ncern about retroactive damages.7 This language also indicates\nthat the Board’s goal was to equalize male and female rates\nfrom 1978 onward. Tellingly, the minutes say nothing about\nlocking in the 1978 rates.\n\n   Finally, as the district court recognized, “[e]ven if the set-\ntlement released retroactive liability in exchange for topping\nup the tables for female members, that does not mean that the\nnewly topped-up benefit was to act as a floor in perpetuity.”\nThe Board had two options available to desegregate its refund\nannuity allowance system: (1) it could create blended rates, or\n(2) it could “top up” the female rates. “Topping up” the\nfemale rates was the best option for the PERS members. Thus,\neven if PERS members did consciously abandon any rights to\nretroactive relief, they may have decided to do so in return for\nthe “topping up” option, not the creation of a permanent bene-\nfits floor.\n\n   [8] In short, we find that, even viewing the evidence on\nretroactive relief in the light most favorable to the PERS\nmembers, the parties did not intend to create a permanent\nfloor on benefits by entering into the consent decree.\n\n                      2.    Course of Conduct\n\n  The PERS members also argue that the Board’s course of\nconduct after 1978 supports their interpretation of the consent\ndecree. Again, we disagree.\n  7\n    Indeed, the only mention of retroactive damages appears in the minutes\ntwo paragraphs earlier in connection with a discussion of the possibility\nof fighting the appeal—not in connection with negotiation of the consent\ndecree.\n\f13134                   EBNER v. OREGON\n   [9] It is undisputed that, from the date of the consent decree\nuntil the Reform Legislation was enacted in 2003, the Board\nmaintained refund annuity rates at or above those in effect for\nmales on July 1, 1978, at least for those members who joined\nPERS prior to 1999. The PERS members contend that the\nBoard’s practice of maintaining annuity rates at those levels\nsuggests that the Board believed that lowering rates would\nviolate the consent decree. However, as discussed above, the\nminutes from the Board meeting suggest that the Board’s\nrefusal to lower annuity rates was attributed to a fear that\nmale PERS members might have vested property rights in the\n1978 rates—not to a fear that lowering the rates would violate\nthe consent decree. Moreover, as the Oregon Supreme Court\nexplained in Strunk, the Board adopted administrative rules in\nthe 1990s to maintain the rates at or above the 1978 levels “in\nresponse to legal advice that it had received regarding main-\ntaining the fund’s status as a qualified governmental retire-\nment plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code.” Strunk,\n108 P.3d at 1106. Finally, there is no contemporaneous docu-\nmentary evidence indicating that, when the Board modified\nthe rates in the years following entry of the consent decree, it\nwas concerned about a benefits floor deriving from the con-\nsent decree.\n\n   [10] In sum, we find that the Board’s continued use of the\n1978 male annuity refund rates cannot be attributed to its fear\nof violating the consent decree. To the contrary, the evidence\nsuggests that the Board did not dip below the 1978 rates due\nto other, unrelated legal concerns.\n\n                        C.   Conclusion\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the extrinsic evi-\ndence of the parties’ intent demonstrates that the consent\ndecree was intended only as a remedy for sex discrimination\nin the calculation of refund annuity payments.\n\n  We note that the overall context of this case plays an\nimportant role in our decision. This case began as a Title VII\n\f                         EBNER v. OREGON                       13135\nlawsuit. The Henderson I plaintiffs filed the suit to end\nPERB’s practice of using sex-segregated refund annuity rates\n—not to establish that all PERS members were entitled to a\nminimum level of benefits. It is highly unlikely that the par-\nties intended to create a permanent floor on refund annuity\nrates when they stipulated to the consent decree. It is much\nmore likely that they decided to equalize the rates from 1978\nonward, and tried to draft the consent decree to that effect.\n\n  Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s summary judg-\nment order on the meaning of the consent decree.\n\nII. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When\n   It Struck Certain Paragraphs From the PERS Members’\n                Summary Judgment Affidavits\n\n   Finally, we address the PERS members’ two challenges to\nthe district court’s evidentiary rulings on summary judgment.\nTo reverse on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, the\ncourt must conclude not only that the district court abused its\ndiscretion, but also that the error was prejudicial. Tritchler v.\nCounty of Lake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785171\"><a href=\"/opinion/785171/carrie-tritchler-v-the-county-of-lake-the-superior-court-in-and-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   First, the PERS members challenge the district court’s\nrefusal to consider paragraphs two through four, and parts of\nparagraph seven, of the affidavit of former PERS attorney\nWilliam Hoelscher. However, as the district court correctly\nnoted, paragraphs two through four of the affidavit, which\ndescribed the holdings of Henderson I and Manhart, merely\nstated legal conclusions. Moreover, the language stricken\nfrom paragraph seven contained improper speculation about\nthe judge’s understanding of the case. Thus, the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in deciding that these paragraphs\nwere not admissible summary judgment evidence.\n\n  Second, the PERS members challenge the district court’s\ndecision to strike paragraphs four, six, and eight8 of the virtu-\n  8\n   Paragraphs six and eight were misnumbered — they are actually para-\ngraphs five and six.\n\f13136                   EBNER v. OREGON\nally identical affidavits submitted by the former PERS Direc-\ntor and Assistant Director. These paragraphs described the\nnegotiations that occurred at the 1978 Board meeting. The\ndistrict court struck the paragraphs because they lacked any\nfacts demonstrating that the PERS Director or Assistant\nDirector were actually at that meeting. The affiants’ assertions\nabout a meeting which they apparently did not attend and\nabout which they had no personal knowledge are not the\nproper subject of an affidavit. Thus, the district court also did\nnot abuse its discretion in striking these paragraphs.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n   The consent decree was intended to ensure that male and\nfemale PERS members who had the same balances in their\nPERS accounts at the time of retirement would receive identi-\ncal refund annuities from the date of the consent decree\nonward. The consent decree was not meant to lock in the 1978\nrefund annuity rates. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
