There is no cat-\n        egorical bar against life sentences without parole for juveniles con-\n        victed of homicide offenses; instead, the sentencing court must consider\n        specific, individualized factors before handing down a sentence of life\n        imprisonment without parole for a juvenile.\n12.\t    Due Process: New Trial: Convictions: Sentences.

He was sentenced as follows: life imprisonment for\neach first degree murder; 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment for\nattempted second degree murder, to be served concurrently\nwith all; 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for attempted rob-\nbery, to be served concurrently with all but its respective\nweapon conviction; 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for criminal\nconspiracy, to be served concurrently with all; and 10 to 15\nyears’ imprisonment for each weapon conviction, to be served\nconsecutively only with each respective first degree murder or\nattempted robbery conviction.\n   On direct appeal, we affirmed Castaneda’s convictions,\nvacated all his sentences, and remanded the cause for resen-\ntencing.1 We vacated Castaneda’s life sentences under the\nU.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Miller v. Alabama.2 We also\nvacated his other sentences because the sentencing court com-\nmitted plain error by ordering Castaneda’s weapon sentences\nto run concurrently with other sentences, instead of consecu-\ntively with all other sentences as required by law.3\n   Following a full evidentiary hearing and arguments,\nCastaneda was resentenced in accordance with Nebraska stat-\nutes. Castaneda appeals his resentencing. We affirm.\n                      BACKGROUND\n   The events underlying Castaneda’s eight convictions and\nsentences involve three shootings that occurred in three sepa-\nrate locations in Omaha, Nebraska, within an hour. In our\nopinion on Castaneda’s direct appeal, we set forth the facts of\nthe case in detail.4\n\n 1\t\n      See State v. Castaneda, 287 Neb. 289, 842 N.W.2d 740 (2014).\n 2\t\n      Miller v.

CASTANEDA\n                       Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\n   The individuals responsible for the crimes were Edgar\nCervantes, Eric Ramirez, and Castaneda. The State entered into\na plea agreement with Cervantes to dismiss the murder charges\nagainst him in exchange for his testimony.\n   According to Cervantes, in November 2008, he asked\nRamirez if he wanted “to go rob some people.” That same\nevening, Castaneda accompanied Cervantes and Ramirez when\nthey left a party to give Jacob Shantz a ride home. While\nCervantes was driving to Shantz’ residence, he removed a gun\nfrom under his seat and gave it to Ramirez.\n   After dropping Shantz off at his home, the three men drove\nto 13th and Dorcas Streets in Omaha. While at that location,\nCervantes stayed in the vehicle and Ramirez and Castaneda\nexited the vehicle. Ramirez and Castaneda approached two\nmales, later identified as Mark and Charles McCormick.\nAccording to the McCormicks, the two men, one of them\narmed, came up to them as they were leaving their cous-\nin’s residence. The men demanded money but retreated\nafter Charles threatened them with a “piece of wood” or\n“tree stump.”\n   Shortly thereafter, at about 10:45 p.m., all three men drove\nto 16th and Dorcas Streets where they encountered Luis Silva\ninside his vehicle outside of his home. Ramirez and Castaneda\napproached Silva to rob him. Castaneda pulled Silva from his\nvehicle, and Ramirez fatally shot him.\n   Then, at about 11 p.m., Cervantes, Ramirez, and Castaneda\ndrove to 50th Street and Underwood Avenue where they\nobserved a man, later identified as Charles Denton, walk\nup to an automatic teller machine. When Denton saw two\nmen approaching, he returned to his vehicle and started to\ndrive away with his passenger. The two men, Ramirez and\nCastaneda, ran toward Denton’s vehicle, and one reached the\ndriver’s side window and demanded money. The man also\nfired his gun at the vehicle, striking Denton. Denton survived\nhis injuries.\n   The three men then drove south until they reached 52d and\nLeavenworth Streets. At that location, they saw Tari Glinsmann\n\f                                     - 551 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v. CASTANEDA\n                              Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\nleaving a gas station. Cervantes stopped the vehicle, and\nRamirez and Castaneda got out. According to Cervantes,\nCastaneda pulled Glinsmann from her vehicle and Ramirez\nfatally shot her. The statement about Glinsmann’s murder was\nsupported by video evidence and Castaneda’s handprint on the\nhood of her car. While Cervantes said that Ramirez told him\nGlinsmann had no money, she was found with cash, jewelry,\nand the keys to the gas station, where she had worked and had\njust finished her shift.\n   At the time of the shootings, Castaneda was 15 years 11\nmonths old. As previously mentioned, Castaneda was con-\nvicted of two counts of first degree felony murder, one count\nof attempted second degree murder, one count of attempted\nrobbery, one count of criminal conspiracy, and three counts\nof use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. Castaneda was\nsentenced to life imprisonment for each first degree murder\nand 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment for attempted murder, with\neach sentence to run concurrently with the other. He was fur-\nther sentenced to 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for attempted\nrobbery, to be served concurrently with all but its respective\nweapon conviction; 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for criminal\nconspiracy, to be served concurrently with all; and 10 to 15\nyears’ imprisonment for each weapon conviction, to be served\nconsecutively only with each respective first degree murder or\nattempted robbery conviction.\n   On direct appeal, we affirmed Castaneda’s convictions.5\nWhile the appeal was pending, however, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt decided Miller.6 We rejected the State’s argument that\nMiller should not apply to Castaneda’s life in prison sen-\ntences, because Nebraska’s penalty statute did not contain\nthe qualifier “without parole.” We held that a sentence of\nlife in prison in Nebraska essentially contains no possibility\nof parole, because parole is available only upon a sentence’s\n\n 5\t\n      See Castaneda, supra note 1.\n 6\t\n      See Miller, supra note 2.\n\f                                    - 552 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v. CASTANEDA\n                              Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\nbeing commutated, which—as “‘an ad hoc exercise of execu-\ntive clemency’”7—is a distinctly different concept than parole\nas a matter of law. Accordingly, we vacated Castaneda’s life\nsentences for first degree felony murder. We also vacated\nhis other sentences, because the sentencing court committed\nplain error by ordering Castaneda’s use of a deadly weapon\nto commit a felony sentences to run concurrently with his\nother sentences, instead of consecutively with all other sen-\ntences as required by § 28-1205(3). We remanded the cause\nfor resentencing.\n   Upon remand, the cause was assigned to a different district\njudge, as the original judge had retired. Before resentencing,\na full evidentiary resentencing hearing was held. At that hear-\ning, Castaneda called three witnesses: Beverly Shields, a juve-\nnile detention specialist at the Douglas County Youth Center\nat the time Castaneda was housed there prior to trial; Dr. Kirk\nNewring, a psychologist who interviewed Castaneda shortly\nbefore resentencing; and Dr. Colleen Conoley, an adolescent\nneuropsychologist who completed an evaluation on Castaneda\nin 2014.\n   Shields testified that Castaneda was a model prisoner and\n“was the best kid [she] ever worked with” during her employ-\nment at the youth center. Newring testified as to the prison\nculture and the effects of segregation on a person. Conoley\ntestified about Castaneda’s current mental status, having been\ndiagnosed as schizophrenic; the maturation process of the ado-\nlescent brain; and her belief that Castaneda is not a high risk to\nreoffend “at this point of his development.”\n   Additionally, a presentence report was ordered for sentenc-\ning. The presentence report included, in part, the following\ninformation: Conoley’s evaluation of Castaneda; the police\nreports of the crimes; letters from the victims’ friends and\nfamilies; Castaneda’s age at the time of his crimes; Castaneda’s\nprior criminal history of graffiti, theft by unlawful taking,\n\n 7\t\n      See Castaneda, supra note 1, 287 Neb. at 313, 842 N.W.2d at 758.\n\f                                     - 553 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

The court pronounced\nthe following prison sentences: 40 to 50 years for each first\ndegree murder conviction, 10 to 10 years for attempted second\ndegree murder, 5 to 5 years for the attempted robbery, 5 to 5\nyears for criminal conspiracy, and 5 to 5 years for each weapon\nconviction. The criminal conspiracy and attempted robbery\nsentences were ordered to run concurrently with each other and\nwith the attempted murder sentence. All other sentences were\nordered to run consecutively to each other. The total combined\nsentence was 105 to 125 years’ imprisonment. Castaneda was\ngiven credit for 2,652 days served. Castaneda appeals.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Castaneda assigns, restated, that the district court erred in\nimposing (1) excessive sentences, (2) an aggregate de facto\nlife sentence prohibited under due process and the Eighth\nAmendment, and (3) more severe sentences than Castaneda\noriginally received.\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] An appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed\nwithin the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion by\nthe trial court.8 A judicial abuse of discretion exists when\n\n 8\t\n      State v.

CASTANEDA\n                             Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\nthe ­reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable,\nunfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying\njust results in matters submitted for disposition.9\n   [3,4] Whether the district court’s resentencing of a defend­\nant following a successful appeal violates the defendant’s due\nprocess rights presents a question of law.10 When reviewing\nquestions of law, an appellate court resolves the questions inde-\npendently of the conclusion reached by the lower court.11\n                           ANALYSIS\n                      Excessive Sentences\n   Castaneda argues that his aggregate sentence of 105 to\n125 years’ imprisonment is excessive because the court\nfailed to adequately consider the required sentencing factors.\nSpecifically, he alleges that the court did not give adequate\nconsideration to his age. Castaneda also argues the sentencing\nwas tailored only to his crimes rather than to him as an individ-\nual, as required by State v. Harrison.12 Finally, he contends that\nthe court did not give sufficient consideration to the aggregate\nlength of the sentences; this argument is essentially the same as\nCastaneda’s second assignment of error that the court imposed\nan aggregrate de facto life sentence.\n   [5,6] There is no contention that Castaneda’s sentences\nwere outside the permissible statutory ranges. Accordingly,\nthe question is whether the court abused its discretion in\nthe sentences it imposed upon Castaneda. We have stated\nthat when imposing a sentence, a sentencing judge should\nconsider the following factors related to the defendant: (1)\nage, (2) mentality, (3) education and experience, (4) social\nand cultural background, (5) past criminal record or record\n\n 9\t\n      Id.\n10\t\n      State v.

CASTANEDA\n                              Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\n   We note in the present case that the sentencing judge, in\nfact, considered each of these factors and discussed them at\nthe sentencing hearing. The sentencing judge acknowledged\nthat he was not the original trial or sentencing judge and,\ninstead, relied on the presentence report, evidentiary hearing,\nand arguments of counsel in sentencing Castaneda. The court\nstated that it considered two main factors: the nature of the\ncrimes committed and Castaneda’s age when he committed\nthe crimes.\n   The court specifically identified numerous mitigating fac-\ntors that it considered—including the fact that Castaneda was\nnot the shooter, his minimal criminal history, his studiousness,\nand his reasonable behavior as a prisoner. Most significantly,\nthe court gave great weight to Castaneda’s age at the time of\nthe offense, the impulsivity of the crimes, and the fact that as\na result of his age, he could not fully appreciate the conse-\nquences of his actions.\n   Conversely, the court also gave significant weight to the\nnature of the offenses Castaneda was convicted of and the\nimpact it had on the victims’ friends and families. The court\nspecifically discussed that because of Castaneda’s age, it\nwanted to assume that he was naive to the violence that would\noccur that night; however, the court could not make such\nan assumption because of Castaneda’s continued participation\nafter being presented with opportunities to remove himself\nfrom the crime spree as the violence escalated. Ultimately,\nthe court concluded that the several and disconnected crimes\nwarranted individual punishment by running his sentences con-\nsecutively. The court’s reasoning reflects sentences tailored to\nboth Castaneda and his crimes.\n   The sentencing range for Castaneda’s first degree murder\nconvictions, Class IA felonies, is 40 years to life in prison.17\n\n17\t\n      § 28-105.02(1). See Castaneda, supra note 1 (holding that sentencing\n      changes to penalty provisions for Class IA felonies committed by persons\n      under 18 years of age, enacted by 2013 Neb.

CASTANEDA\n                              Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\nCastaneda’s convictions for attempted murder in the second\ndegree, criminal conspiracy, and use of a deadly weapon to\ncommit a felony are each Class II felonies subject to a sen-\ntence of 1 to 50 years’ imprisonment,18 and attempted robbery\nis a Class III felony that, when committed, was subject to a\nsentence of 1 to 20 years’ imprisonment, a $25,000 fine, or\nboth.19 Castaneda was resentenced as set forth above. Each of\nhis sentences were on the low end of their respective statutory\nsentencing ranges. Further, the attempted robbery and criminal\nconspiracy sentences were made concurrent with the attempted\nsecond degree murder sentence.\n   [9] The court gave sufficient consideration to each of the\nrelevant factors, determining that leniency was warranted in\nCastaneda’s sentences, evidenced by each being on the low\nend of the potential range. But, the court determined that both\nmurders and the attempted murder were each distinct and sepa-\nrate incidents, offering Castaneda the choice to participate or\nflee at each scene. Under our prior holdings, it is within a trial\ncourt’s discretion to direct that sentences imposed for sepa-\nrate crimes be served either concurrently or consecut­ively.20\nTherefore, Castaneda’s separate decision to commit each crime\nwarranted a distinct punishment for each. In light of these\nfacts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its dis-\ncretion in sentencing Castaneda.\n\n                    De Facto Life Sentence\n   In Castaneda’s second assignment of error, he argues that the\naggregate of his sentences constitutes a de facto life sentence.\nFurther, he contends that this aggregate sentence does not pro-\nvide a “meaningful opportunity for release,” under Miller,21\n\n18\t\n      See Neb.

Mantich,25 the defendant, Douglas M. Mantich, a\njuvenile at the time of his crimes, was convicted of first degree\nfelony murder and use of a firearm to commit a felony. When\nMantich was sentenced, Nebraska’s statutes provided that a\njuvenile convicted of first degree murder was subject to man-\ndatory life imprisonment. Accordingly, Mantich was initially\nsentenced to life imprisonment for the first degree murder\nconviction and 5 to 20 years’ imprisonment for the firearm\nconviction, to be served consecutively.26 Mantich appealed,\nand we affirmed Mantich’s convictions and life imprison-\nment sentence and vacated and remanded his firearm sentence\nfor resentencing.27\n   At the same time we decided Castaneda’s direct appeal,28\nwe also considered Mantich’s appeal of his motion for post-\nconviction relief.29 In Castaneda’s direct appeal, we held that\n\n22\t\n      Brief for appellant at 26, 28.\n23\t\n      Miller, supra note 2.\n24\t\n      Id.\n25\t\n      State v.

Mantich appealed.\n   [10,11] In Mantich’s most recent appeal,32 we addressed\nthe issue of Miller and its application, and we determined that\nfelony murder is a homicide offense. We also explained that\nin Graham v. Florida,33 the U.S. Supreme Court held that “life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole for juveniles\nconvicted of nonhomicide offenses was unconstitutional.”34\nWe noted the Court further held that “such juvenile offend-\ners must be given ‘some meaningful opportunity to obtain\nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.’”35\nHowever, we reasoned that in Miller, “the Court declined to\nextend the categorical bar of no life sentences without parole\nto juveniles convicted of homicide.”36 Instead, Miller’s require-\nment that a juvenile have a meaningful opportunity for release\nrequired that “‘a sentencer must consider specific, individual-\nized factors before handing down a sentence of life impris-\nonment without parole for a juvenile.’”37 Accordingly, we\nrejected Mantich’s de facto life sentence argument, “[b]ecause\nunder Miller a juvenile defendant may be sentenced to life\n\n30\t\n      Castaneda, supra note 1, 287 Neb. at 313-14, 842 N.W.2d at 758.

Before issuing the sentences, the\ncourt discussed the individualized factors it was required to\nconsider and how they impacted its decision. Even assuming,\nwithout deciding, that a court was required to find a juvenile\n“irreparably corrupt” before issuing him or her a life imprison-\nment without parole sentence, the court here gave Castaneda\nno such sentence; instead, it sentenced Castaneda on the low\nend of the statutory range for each of his eight convictions.\nAccordingly, Castaneda received the protections required by\nMiller for a juvenile convicted of a homicide offense.\n\n                     Vindictive Sentences\n   In his third assignment of error, Castaneda argues that\nhis new sentences are more severe than his original sen-\ntences. While he concedes that the length of his sentences has\ndecreased, he contends that changing his murder and attempted\nmurder sentences from concurrent39 to consecutive made them\ninherently more severe. Accordingly, he argues that his resen-\ntencing was presumptively vindictive under North Carolina\nv. Pearce.40\n   The State argues that Castaneda’s aggregate sentence is not\nmore severe upon resentencing, because he is now eligible for\nparole after 521⁄2 years, when he was originally sentenced to\nlife in prison without parole.

Lastly, the State contends that because Castaneda\nhad the burden to prove actual vindictiveness and failed to\nargue actual vindictiveness, his assignment of error is with-\nout merit.\n   [12] We discussed vindictive resentencing most recently in\nState v. Miller.41 We explained:\n         “Due process of law . . . requires that vindictiveness\n      against a defendant for having successfully attacked his\n      first conviction must play no part in the sentence he\n      receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such\n      vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant’s\n      exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his\n      first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant\n      be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation\n      on the part of the sentencing judge.”42\nAccordingly, we recognized that to relieve a defendant of the\napprehension of vindictiveness, Pearce required that courts\napply a presumption of vindictiveness whenever a sentence is\nincreased after a successful appeal of the prior conviction.\n   [13,14] However, we also recognized that the U.S. Supreme\nCourt has limited this presumption since Pearce to “cases\nwhich pose a reasonable likelihood that the increased sentence\nis the product of actual vindictiveness.”43 Accordingly, we\nstated: “[The] Court has limited the presumption of vindic-\ntiveness to cases that involve the same judge or jury handing\ndown both the initial sentence and the second, harsher sen-\ntence. . . . [Alternatively, w]hen the presumption of vindictive-\nness is not applied, the burden remains with the defendant to\nprove actual vindictiveness.”44\n\n41\t\n      Miller, supra note 10.\n42\t\n      Id. at 501, 822 N.W.2d 364, quoting Pearce, supra note 40.\n43\t\n      Id. at 502, 822 N.W.2d 364, citing Smith, supra note 40.\n44\t\n      Id. at 502, 504, 822 N.W.2d 364, 366, citing Smith, supra note 40.\n\f                             - 562 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   295 Nebraska R eports\n                      STATE v. CASTANEDA\n                       Cite as 295 Neb. 547\n\n   Here, Castaneda was sentenced by two different judges.\nTherefore, we agree with the State that Castaneda is not enti-\ntled to a presumption of vindictiveness.\n   Further, Castaneda made no argument of actual vindictive-\nness, and our review of the record does not reveal any imper-\nmissible considerations or vindictiveness by the court. Instead,\nthe court weighed the required factors under the relevant case\nlaw and § 28-105.02. The court also took into consideration\nthe fact that Castaneda was not the shooter and that he had\ndecreased cognitive ability due to his age and immaturity.\nHowever, the court could not overlook the fact that Castaneda\nwas involved in three distinct incidents of gun violence that\nresulted in the deaths of two people and the wounding of a\nthird. Ultimately, the court believed that Castaneda’s youth\nentitled him to sentences on the low end of the statutory range,\nbut that his actions required he serve the sentences consecu-\ntively. Consequently, we conclude Castaneda’s assignment of\nerror is without merit.\n                      CONCLUSION\n  The sentences of the district court are affirmed.\n                                                      A ffirmed.\n\f",

There is no cat-\n        egorical bar against life sentences without parole for juveniles con-\n        victed of homicide offenses; instead, the sentencing court must consider\n        specific, individualized factors before handing down a sentence of life\n        imprisonment without parole for a juvenile.\n12.\t    Due Process: New Trial: Convictions: Sentences. Due process of law\n        requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having success-\n        fully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he\n        receives after a new trial.\n13.\t    Sentences: Presumptions: Appeal and Error. There is no presumption\n        of vindictiveness when a sentence is increased after a successful appeal\n        of the prior conviction if a different judge or jury handed down the sec-\n        ond, harsher sentence.\n14.\t    Sentences: Presumptions: Proof. When the presumption of vindictive-\n        ness is not applied, the burden remains with the defendant to prove\n        actual vindictiveness.\n\n   Appeal from the District Court for Douglas County: Peter\nC.

The State entered into\na plea agreement with Cervantes to dismiss the murder charges\nagainst him in exchange for his testimony.\n   According to Cervantes, in November 2008, he asked\nRamirez if he wanted “to go rob some people.” That same\nevening, Castaneda accompanied Cervantes and Ramirez when\nthey left a party to give Jacob Shantz a ride home. While\nCervantes was driving to Shantz’ residence, he removed a gun\nfrom under his seat and gave it to Ramirez.\n   After dropping Shantz off at his home, the three men drove\nto 13th and Dorcas Streets in Omaha. While at that location,\nCervantes stayed in the vehicle and Ramirez and Castaneda\nexited the vehicle. Ramirez and Castaneda approached two\nmales, later identified as Mark and Charles McCormick.\nAccording to the McCormicks, the two men, one of them\narmed, came up to them as they were leaving their cous-\nin’s residence. The men demanded money but retreated\nafter Charles threatened them with a “piece of wood” or\n“tree stump.”\n   Shortly thereafter, at about 10:45 p.m., all three men drove\nto 16th and Dorcas Streets where they encountered Luis Silva\ninside his vehicle outside of his home. Ramirez and Castaneda\napproached Silva to rob him. Castaneda pulled Silva from his\nvehicle, and Ramirez fatally shot him.\n   Then, at about 11 p.m., Cervantes, Ramirez, and Castaneda\ndrove to 50th Street and Underwood Avenue where they\nobserved a man, later identified as Charles Denton, walk\nup to an automatic teller machine. When Denton saw two\nmen approaching, he returned to his vehicle and started to\ndrive away with his passenger. The two men, Ramirez and\nCastaneda, ran toward Denton’s vehicle, and one reached the\ndriver’s side window and demanded money. The man also\nfired his gun at the vehicle, striking Denton. Denton survived\nhis injuries.\n   The three men then drove south until they reached 52d and\nLeavenworth Streets. At that location, they saw Tari Glinsmann\n\f                                     - 551 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

Cervantes stopped the vehicle, and\nRamirez and Castaneda got out. According to Cervantes,\nCastaneda pulled Glinsmann from her vehicle and Ramirez\nfatally shot her. The statement about Glinsmann’s murder was\nsupported by video evidence and Castaneda’s handprint on the\nhood of her car. While Cervantes said that Ramirez told him\nGlinsmann had no money, she was found with cash, jewelry,\nand the keys to the gas station, where she had worked and had\njust finished her shift.\n   At the time of the shootings, Castaneda was 15 years 11\nmonths old. As previously mentioned, Castaneda was con-\nvicted of two counts of first degree felony murder, one count\nof attempted second degree murder, one count of attempted\nrobbery, one count of criminal conspiracy, and three counts\nof use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. Castaneda was\nsentenced to life imprisonment for each first degree murder\nand 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment for attempted murder, with\neach sentence to run concurrently with the other. He was fur-\nther sentenced to 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for attempted\nrobbery, to be served concurrently with all but its respective\nweapon conviction; 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment for criminal\nconspiracy, to be served concurrently with all; and 10 to 15\nyears’ imprisonment for each weapon conviction, to be served\nconsecutively only with each respective first degree murder or\nattempted robbery conviction.\n   On direct appeal, we affirmed Castaneda’s convictions.5\nWhile the appeal was pending, however, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt decided Miller.6 We rejected the State’s argument that\nMiller should not apply to Castaneda’s life in prison sen-\ntences, because Nebraska’s penalty statute did not contain\nthe qualifier “without parole.” We held that a sentence of\nlife in prison in Nebraska essentially contains no possibility\nof parole, because parole is available only upon a sentence’s\n\n 5\t\n      See Castaneda, supra note 1.\n 6\t\n      See Miller, supra note 2.\n\f                                    - 552 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

Accordingly, we vacated Castaneda’s life\nsentences for first degree felony murder. We also vacated\nhis other sentences, because the sentencing court committed\nplain error by ordering Castaneda’s use of a deadly weapon\nto commit a felony sentences to run concurrently with his\nother sentences, instead of consecutively with all other sen-\ntences as required by § 28-1205(3). We remanded the cause\nfor resentencing.\n   Upon remand, the cause was assigned to a different district\njudge, as the original judge had retired. Before resentencing,\na full evidentiary resentencing hearing was held. At that hear-\ning, Castaneda called three witnesses: Beverly Shields, a juve-\nnile detention specialist at the Douglas County Youth Center\nat the time Castaneda was housed there prior to trial; Dr. Kirk\nNewring, a psychologist who interviewed Castaneda shortly\nbefore resentencing; and Dr. Colleen Conoley, an adolescent\nneuropsychologist who completed an evaluation on Castaneda\nin 2014.\n   Shields testified that Castaneda was a model prisoner and\n“was the best kid [she] ever worked with” during her employ-\nment at the youth center. Newring testified as to the prison\nculture and the effects of segregation on a person. Conoley\ntestified about Castaneda’s current mental status, having been\ndiagnosed as schizophrenic; the maturation process of the ado-\nlescent brain; and her belief that Castaneda is not a high risk to\nreoffend “at this point of his development.”\n   Additionally, a presentence report was ordered for sentenc-\ning. The presentence report included, in part, the following\ninformation: Conoley’s evaluation of Castaneda; the police\nreports of the crimes; letters from the victims’ friends and\nfamilies; Castaneda’s age at the time of his crimes; Castaneda’s\nprior criminal history of graffiti, theft by unlawful taking,\n\n 7\t\n      See Castaneda, supra note 1, 287 Neb. at 313, 842 N.W.2d at 758.\n\f                                     - 553 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        295 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

Castaneda also argues the sentencing\nwas tailored only to his crimes rather than to him as an individ-\nual, as required by State v. Harrison.12 Finally, he contends that\nthe court did not give sufficient consideration to the aggregate\nlength of the sentences; this argument is essentially the same as\nCastaneda’s second assignment of error that the court imposed\nan aggregrate de facto life sentence.\n   [5,6] There is no contention that Castaneda’s sentences\nwere outside the permissible statutory ranges.

The sentencing judge acknowledged\nthat he was not the original trial or sentencing judge and,\ninstead, relied on the presentence report, evidentiary hearing,\nand arguments of counsel in sentencing Castaneda. The court\nstated that it considered two main factors: the nature of the\ncrimes committed and Castaneda’s age when he committed\nthe crimes.\n   The court specifically identified numerous mitigating fac-\ntors that it considered—including the fact that Castaneda was\nnot the shooter, his minimal criminal history, his studiousness,\nand his reasonable behavior as a prisoner. Most significantly,\nthe court gave great weight to Castaneda’s age at the time of\nthe offense, the impulsivity of the crimes, and the fact that as\na result of his age, he could not fully appreciate the conse-\nquences of his actions.\n   Conversely, the court also gave significant weight to the\nnature of the offenses Castaneda was convicted of and the\nimpact it had on the victims’ friends and families. The court\nspecifically discussed that because of Castaneda’s age, it\nwanted to assume that he was naive to the violence that would\noccur that night; however, the court could not make such\nan assumption because of Castaneda’s continued participation\nafter being presented with opportunities to remove himself\nfrom the crime spree as the violence escalated. Ultimately,\nthe court concluded that the several and disconnected crimes\nwarranted individual punishment by running his sentences con-\nsecutively. The court’s reasoning reflects sentences tailored to\nboth Castaneda and his crimes.\n   The sentencing range for Castaneda’s first degree murder\nconvictions, Class IA felonies, is 40 years to life in prison.17\n\n17\t\n      § 28-105.02(1).

Each of\nhis sentences were on the low end of their respective statutory\nsentencing ranges. Further, the attempted robbery and criminal\nconspiracy sentences were made concurrent with the attempted\nsecond degree murder sentence.\n   [9] The court gave sufficient consideration to each of the\nrelevant factors, determining that leniency was warranted in\nCastaneda’s sentences, evidenced by each being on the low\nend of the potential range. But, the court determined that both\nmurders and the attempted murder were each distinct and sepa-\nrate incidents, offering Castaneda the choice to participate or\nflee at each scene. Under our prior holdings, it is within a trial\ncourt’s discretion to direct that sentences imposed for sepa-\nrate crimes be served either concurrently or consecut­ively.20\nTherefore, Castaneda’s separate decision to commit each crime\nwarranted a distinct punishment for each.

When\nMantich was sentenced, Nebraska’s statutes provided that a\njuvenile convicted of first degree murder was subject to man-\ndatory life imprisonment. Accordingly, Mantich was initially\nsentenced to life imprisonment for the first degree murder\nconviction and 5 to 20 years’ imprisonment for the firearm\nconviction, to be served consecutively.26 Mantich appealed,\nand we affirmed Mantich’s convictions and life imprison-\nment sentence and vacated and remanded his firearm sentence\nfor resentencing.27\n   At the same time we decided Castaneda’s direct appeal,28\nwe also considered Mantich’s appeal of his motion for post-\nconviction relief.29 In Castaneda’s direct appeal, we held that\n\n22\t\n      Brief for appellant at 26, 28.\n23\t\n      Miller, supra note 2.\n24\t\n      Id.\n25\t\n      State v.

Before issuing the sentences, the\ncourt discussed the individualized factors it was required to\nconsider and how they impacted its decision. Even assuming,\nwithout deciding, that a court was required to find a juvenile\n“irreparably corrupt” before issuing him or her a life imprison-\nment without parole sentence, the court here gave Castaneda\nno such sentence; instead, it sentenced Castaneda on the low\nend of the statutory range for each of his eight convictions.\nAccordingly, Castaneda received the protections required by\nMiller for a juvenile convicted of a homicide offense.\n\n                     Vindictive Sentences\n   In his third assignment of error, Castaneda argues that\nhis new sentences are more severe than his original sen-\ntences. While he concedes that the length of his sentences has\ndecreased, he contends that changing his murder and attempted\nmurder sentences from concurrent39 to consecutive made them\ninherently more severe. Accordingly, he argues that his resen-\ntencing was presumptively vindictive under North Carolina\nv.

Lastly, the State contends that because Castaneda\nhad the burden to prove actual vindictiveness and failed to\nargue actual vindictiveness, his assignment of error is with-\nout merit.\n   [12] We discussed vindictive resentencing most recently in\nState v. Miller.41 We explained:\n         “Due process of law . . . requires that vindictiveness\n      against a defendant for having successfully attacked his\n      first conviction must play no part in the sentence he\n      receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such\n      vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant’s\n      exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his\n      first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant\n      be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation\n      on the part of the sentencing judge.”42\nAccordingly, we recognized that to relieve a defendant of the\napprehension of vindictiveness, Pearce required that courts\napply a presumption of vindictiveness whenever a sentence is\nincreased after a successful appeal of the prior conviction.\n   [13,14] However, we also recognized that the U.S. Supreme\nCourt has limited this presumption since Pearce to “cases\nwhich pose a reasonable likelihood that the increased sentence\nis the product of actual vindictiveness.”43 Accordingly, we\nstated: “[The] Court has limited the presumption of vindic-\ntiveness to cases that involve the same judge or jury handing\ndown both the initial sentence and the second, harsher sen-\ntence. . . . [Alternatively, w]hen the presumption of vindictive-\nness is not applied, the burden remains with the defendant to\nprove actual vindictiveness.”44\n\n41\t\n      Miller, supra note 10.\n42\t\n      Id. at 501, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, quoting Pearce, supra note 40.\n43\t\n      Id. at 502, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, citing Smith, supra note 40.\n44\t\n      Id. at 502, 504, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366, citing Smith, supra note 40.\n\f                             - 562 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   295 Nebraska R eports\n                      STATE v.

Instead,\nthe court weighed the required factors under the relevant case\nlaw and § 28-105.02. The court also took into consideration\nthe fact that Castaneda was not the shooter and that he had\ndecreased cognitive ability due to his age and immaturity.\nHowever, the court could not overlook the fact that Castaneda\nwas involved in three distinct incidents of gun violence that\nresulted in the deaths of two people and the wounding of a\nthird.
