Staskal,\n\nJudge.\n\n\n\n      Patriot Title and Escrow appeals the district court’s grant of the motion to\n\ndismiss filed by Trio Solutions, LLC. AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      Patrick T. Vint of Hopkins & Huebner, P.C., Des Moines, for appellant.\n\n      Stanley J. Thompson and Sarah K.

Patriot asserts the court erred in finding claim\n\npreclusion prohibited Patriot from bringing its current claim of replevin, arguing\n\nthat the replevin action could not have been brought in the first breach of contract\n\nsuit due to the statutory prohibition of joining other claims with a replevin cause of\n\naction. It further asserts the replevin claim was not ripe until after the verdict was\n\nrendered in the contract case and, additionally, that the two suits involve different\n\nunderlying facts, which prevents the doctrine of claim preclusion from barring its\n\npresent suit. While acknowledging a replevin action could not have been joined\n\nwith the breach of contract case, we agree with the district court that a claim for\n\nconversion could have been asserted in the prior litigation. Moreover, because\n\nboth suits involve the same underlying transactions, facts, and evidence, claim\n\npreclusion bars Patriot from bringing its current replevin action. Consequently,\n\nthe district court properly granted Trio’s motion, and we affirm.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Patriot and Trio are two businesses that provide various services in\n\nconnection with real estate transactions. From June 1, 2010, to November 30,\n\n2010, the two businesses attempted to merge.              During this time Patriot\n\ntransferred various assets to Trio, such as accounts receivable, client lists, and\n\nworks in progress.\n\f                                           3\n\n\n       On March 4, 2011, Patriot filed suit against Trio, alleging Trio had\n\nbreached the contracts that had been established between the parties.1\n\nSpecifically, count one of the amended petition alleged:\n\n               In May, 2010, Plaintiffs entered into an Exchange and\n       Contribution Agreement (attached as Exhibit 1), Employment\n       Agreement (attached as Exhibit 2), and Operating Agreement for\n       Community Title, L.L.C. (attached as Exhibit 3).\n               Consideration was exchanged between the parties in\n       execution of the contracts.\n               Plaintiffs have performed in accordance with the terms of the\n       contract.\n               Defendants have breached the contracts.\n               The breach of the contract has caused damage to the\n       Plaintiffs.\n\nCount three stated:\n\n               On May 12, 2010, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a\n       written contract whereby Plaintiffs’ businesses would merge with\n       those of the Defendants, and Plaintiff Charles Hendricks would\n       begin employment with the newly merged business. Please see\n       Exhibit 4, attached hereto and incorporated herewith.\n               Plaintiffs have performed in accordance with the terms of the\n       contract.\n               Defendants have breached the contract.\n               The breach of the contract has caused damage to the\n       Plaintiffs.\n\nThe petition also alleged a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\n       A jury trial was held from April 9, 2012, to April 13, 2012, in which Patriot\n\nsubmitted various documents showing it had transferred to Trio specific accounts\n\nreceivable. These exhibits were submitted for the purpose of demonstrating the\n\ncontract consideration offered by Patriot. It then requested judgment be entered\n\n\n1\n The merger also involved another company, Community Title, L.L.C., located in South\nDakota. It, along with two individuals, were named as defendants in the first lawsuit.\nThey were not parties to the second suit, nor are they involved in the present appeal.\nThe first suit also named Charles Hendricks, the owner of Patriot, as a plaintiff, but he\nwas not named in the second suit.\n\f                                           4\n\n\n“for the full and fair amount of the damages sustained . . . as well as any other\n\nrelief which this Court deems just and necessary.”            Following the close of\n\nevidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defense, specifically finding\n\nno contracts had been created and there was no fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, Patriot filed a second suit against Trio.             The\n\npetition alleged a claim for replevin and a conversion claim.2 Specifically, the\n\nreplevin claim stated:\n\n              Defendant remains in possession of funds held in a\n       segregated bank account known to Defendant as Patriot Title\n       Capital Clearing Account.\n              To Plaintiff’s best knowledge, $29,204.00 is currently held in\n       the Patriot Title Capital Clearing Account.\n              Funds in the Patriot Title Capital Clearing Account were\n       collected by Defendant from accounts receivable transferred by\n       Patriot Title to Trio Solutions as part of the failed merger, and were\n       not returned after the merger failed.\n              The particular funds in the account were neither taken on the\n       order or judgment of a court against the Plaintiff nor under an\n       execution or attachment against the Plaintiff or against the property.\n              Plaintiff is entitled to recover $29,204.00 in the account, as\n       well as additional amounts for the loss of use of the property while\n       held by Defendant.\n\n       On December 18, 2012, Trio filed a motion to dismiss alleging, in part, that\n\nclaim preclusion barred Patriot’s second suit. A hearing on the matter was held,\n\nand the district court granted the motion to dismiss,3 finding the doctrine of claim\n\npreclusion prevented Patriot from bringing its current action. The court stated:\n\n       Patriot probably could not have asserted a replevin claim in the\n       prior litigation since such a claim, under Iowa Code section 643.2,\n\n2\n  The district court granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety, and Patriot does not\npursue any arguments related to the conversion claim on appeal.\n3\n  The district court noted that it considered the motion to dismiss filed by Trio in the\nalternative as a motion for summary judgment, considering it took judicial notice of the\ncourt documents from the previous suit and therefore was viewing evidence outside of\nthe pleadings.\n\f                                           5\n\n\n       cannot be joined with any other type of claim. But Patriot’s instant\n       replevin claim is for the return of money and damages for the loss\n       of its use. A replevin claim is not the only way, if it is a way at all, to\n       recover money. It seems to the court that Patriot could have\n       recovered the money on a claim of unjust enrichment or restitution\n       . . . . Beyond this, Patriot certainly could have recovered the money\n       by making its conversion claim in the prior litigation. Finally, Patriot\n       did assert a fraud claim against Trio in the prior litigation. Such a\n       claim does not argue for the existence of a contract and surely,\n       under that claim, Patriot could have recovered what it seeks in this\n       case.\n\nPatriot filed a motion to reconsider and another hearing was held, in which the\n\ncourt also took into consideration the transcript from the previous trial.           In a\n\nwritten ruling filed June 26, 2013, the court denied Patriot’s motion, stating it had\n\nconsidered all of the parties’ arguments and reiterating its conclusion that claim\n\npreclusion applied. Patriot appeals.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\n       We review rulings on motions for summary judgment or motions to dismiss\n\nfor correction of errors at law. Wallace v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.\n\nBd. of Dirs., 754 N.W.2d 854, 857 (Iowa 2008). If there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact after a review of the entire record, summary judgment is appropriate\n\nas a matter of law. Stew-Mc Dev., Inc. v. Fischer, 770 N.W.2d 839, 844 (Iowa\n\n2009). Accordingly, we review the district court’s ruling “to determine whether\n\nthe moving party demonstrated the absence of any genuine issues of material\n\nfact and established entitlement to judgment on the merits as a matter of law.”\n\nC&J Vantage Leasing Co. v. Outlook Farm Golf Club, LLC, 784 N.W.2d 753, 756\n\n(Iowa 2010). In performing this review, we examine the record in a light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\n\f                                          6\n\n\nIII. Claim Preclusion\n\n       The doctrine of claim preclusion bars the initiation of a second suit where\n\nthe plaintiff has already had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate all claims\n\nassociated with the transactions underlying the case.         Pavone v. Kirke, 807\n\nN.W.2d 828, 835 (Iowa 2011).         Even where specific issues have not been\n\nlitigated, if the party could have brought the cause of action in the first suit, claim\n\npreclusion prohibits a second suit alleging the claim. Id. Furthermore:\n\n       To establish claim preclusion a party must show: (1) the parties in\n       the first and second action are the same parties or parties in privity,\n       (2) there was a final judgment on the merits in the first action, and\n       (3) the claim in the second suit could have been fully and fairly\n       adjudicated in the prior case (i.e., both suits involve the same\n       cause of action).\n\nId. at 836.\n\n       In deciding whether the claim could have been fully and fairly adjudicated\n\nin the prior suit, we consider (1) the protected right, (2) the alleged wrong, and\n\n(3) the relevant evidence. Id. Thus, where the same evidence supports both\n\ncauses of action, and the defendant’s actions underlying both suits are the same,\n\nthe third element is satisfied and claim preclusion likely applies. Id.\n\n       With regard to the purpose of the doctrine:\n\n       The policy of the law underlying claim preclusion is that a claim\n       cannot be split or tried piecemeal. Thus, a party must try all issues\n       growing out of the claim at one time and not in separate actions.\n       An adjudication in a prior action between the same parties on the\n       same claim is final as to all issues that could have been presented\n       to the court for determination. Simply put, a party is not entitled to\n       a “second bite” simply by alleging a new theory of recovery for the\n       same wrong.\n\nId. at 835–36 (internal citation omitted). In line with this rationale, our supreme\n\ncourt has noted that:\n\f                                          7\n\n\n              When any of the following circumstances exists, the general\n       [claim preclusion] rule of § 24 does not apply to extinguish the\n       claim, and part or all of the claim subsists as a possible basis for a\n       second action by the plaintiff against the defendant:\n              ....\n              The plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the\n       case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action\n       because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the\n       courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories\n       or demands for multiple remedies or forms of relief in a single\n       action, and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that\n       theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.\n\nShumaker v. Iowa Dep’t of Transp., 541 N.W.2d 850, 853–54 (Iowa 1995)\n\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26 (1982)).\n\n       Here, the parties dispute the third element of claim preclusion, that is,\n\nwhether the replevin action could have been fully and fairly adjudicated in\n\nPatriot’s first suit alleging breach of contract. Patriot argues that, pursuant to\n\nIowa Code section 643.2 (2011), it could not have brought the replevin claim in\n\nthe first action, given it was statutorily barred from joining the replevin action with\n\nits other claims.   Trio first counters that Patriot failed to preserve error with\n\nrespect to its section 643.2 argument.        However, Trio asserts, were we to\n\nconsider the merits of this argument, the proper remedy for a misjoined action is\n\nto sever the counts and try the cases separately, and therefore Patriot still could\n\nhave brought its claim of replevin.\n\n       A. Error Preservation\n\n       As an initial matter, we will examine whether Patriot preserved error on its\n\nargument that section 643.2 barred it from bringing its replevin claim subsequent\n\nto the breach of contract action. In its ruling, the district court noted: “Patriot\n\nprobably could not have asserted a replevin claim in the prior litigation since such\n\f                                            8\n\n\na claim, under Iowa Code section 643.2, cannot be joined with any other type of\n\nclaim.” In its motion to reconsider, Patriot specifically addressed section 643.2,\n\nand the subsequent ruling noted the court “carefully considered the motion to\n\nreconsider and the arguments made by counsel.” As long as the lower court\n\nconsidered the issue and ruled on it, error is deemed to have been preserved.\n\nLamasters v. State, 821 N.W.2d 856, 864 (Iowa 2012). Therefore, the record\n\ndemonstrates the district court “considered the issue,” and we will address the\n\nmerits of Patriot’s argument. See id.\n\n       B. Iowa Code section 643.2\n\n       “Replevin is a specialized statutory remedy with a narrow purpose\n\ndesigned to restore possession of property to the party entitled to possession.”\n\nRoush v. Mahaska State Bank, 605 N.W.2d 6, 9 (Iowa 2000). Though damages\n\nmay be awarded, they are incidental to the purpose of a replevin action, which is\n\nto return the property to its owner.        Id.; see also Iowa Code § 643.17.           To\n\nsucceed on this claim, the plaintiff must be able to identify the specific property,\n\nprove that it owns the property, and that the defendant is in wrongful possession\n\nof it.4 See generally Flickenger v. Mark IV Apartment Ass’n, 315 N.W.2d 794,\n\n796–97 (Iowa 1982).\n\n       Pursuant to Iowa Code section 643.2, no other claim may be joined to a\n\npetition alleging replevin; additionally, the defendant is not permitted to submit\n\n\n\n4\n  By contrast, to succeed on a claim of breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove:\n(1) the existence of a contract, (2) the terms and conditions of the contract, (3) that the\nplaintiff has performed all the terms and conditions required under the contract, (4) the\ndefendant’s breach of the contract in some particular way, and (5) that the plaintiff has\nsuffered damages as a result of the defendant’s breach. Royal Indem. Co. v. Factory\nMut. Ins. Co., 786 N.W.2d 839, 846 (Iowa 2010).\n\f                                           9\n\n\nany counterclaims. This is due to the particularized nature of a replevin action,\n\nwhich is a narrow remedy designed to return the property to its rightful owner.\n\nSee Roush, 605 N.W.2d at 9.\n\n       If a claim is improperly joined, the remedy is to either sever the claims and\n\ndocket them separately, or to strike the improper claim. Id. at 10 (holding that,\n\nthough a replevin claim cannot be joined with another cause of action, the district\n\ncourt improperly dismissed the suit); see also Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.236(2) (“The only\n\nremedy for improper joinder of actions shall be by motion. On such motion the\n\ncourt shall either order the causes docketed separately or strike those causes\n\nwhich should be stricken, always retaining at least one cause docketed in the\n\noriginal case.”).\n\n       We agree with Trio’s assertion that Patriot could have sought return of the\n\nalleged wrongfully retained funds in the first suit. As set forth in more detail\n\nbelow, the claims involve the same facts, evidence, and actions of both parties.\n\nTherefore, Patriot could have alleged a conversion claim in the first suit, and, in\n\nfact, conceded at oral argument that it would have been appropriate to do so.5\n\n       Furthermore, to prove Patriot’s assertion that contracts had been formed,\n\nPatriot submitted evidence showing assets had been transferred to Trio. Ken\n\nHoyne, Trio’s comptroller, testified during trial that proceeds of Patriot’s accounts\n\nreceivable had been kept in a segregated account, which is the account Patriot\n\n\n\n5\n  We also note the asset Patriot now seeks in its replevin action is the $29,204 Trio\nobtained from the accounts receivable. However, as Patriot conceded at oral argument,\nTrio was the entity that actually worked the accounts and collected the money owed on\nthose accounts. Thus, Patriot is not seeking the asset transferred but, rather, the money\ngenerated from the accounts receivable, which were transferred to Trio during the\nattempted merger.\n\f                                         10\n\n\nnow seeks in its replevin action. However, a claim for breach of contract would\n\ninclude damages for return of property wrongfully retained through conversion of\n\nthose assets. Thus, regardless of the jury’s finding, Patriot could have attempted\n\nto prove ownership and then sought the collection proceeds of its transferred\n\naccounts receivable at the time of the breach-of-contract trial. As previously\n\nnoted, Patriot conceded it could have done this if it had amended the petition to\n\ninclude a conversion claim. Consequently, Patriot’s argument that section 643.2\n\nprevented it from bringing a replevin action for those very assets is barred by\n\nclaim preclusion.\n\n       C. Ripeness\n\n       Patriot, in the alternative, argues its claim of replevin was not ripe at the\n\ntime of the first suit because Trio did not unlawfully possess its property until the\n\njury decided there was no contract.       A claim is ripe if it presents an actual,\n\npresent controversy, and can be adjudicated when the suit is brought. See Iowa\n\nCoal Mining Co. v. Monroe Cnty., 555 N.W.2d 418, 432 (Iowa 1996).                Trio\n\npossessed money it collected on the transferred accounts receivable at the time\n\nof the first suit, and though its alleged unlawful possession of the property was\n\nnot part of Patriot’s original claims, Patriot could have plead, in the alternative, a\n\nclaim of conversion. See Whalen v. Connelly, 621 N.W.2d 681, 685 (Iowa 2000)\n\n(noting the doctrine of election of remedies did not bar the plaintiff’s conversion\n\nclaim when the defendant wrongfully withheld the plaintiff’s stock in the\n\ncompany).    Consequently, as discussed above, Patriot could have brought a\n\nclaim at the time of the first suit to prove ownership of the proceeds of the\n\naccounts receivable, regardless of whether it knew about the specific account\n\f                                           11\n\n\ncreated by Trio containing the $29,204.         Therefore, a justiciable controversy\n\nexisted at the time of the first suit, and Patriot’s argument that it was unable to\n\nbring the claim because it was not ripe fails. See Iowa Coal Mining Co., 555\n\nN.W.2d at 432.\n\n       D. Underlying Claims\n\n       Patriot’s final argument contends it did not have the opportunity to fully\n\nand fairly litigate its claim of replevin in the first action, due to the contrary nature\n\nof the theories, and the fact different evidence supports each claim. However,\n\nwe agree with the district court that Patriot’s current claim involves the same\n\nfacts, evidence, and underlying transactions, and therefore it could have alleged\n\nan alternative remedy—conversion—in its first suit, which may have resulted in\n\nawarding Patriot the $29,204 Trio collected from the accounts receivable.\n\n       Primarily, both suits involve the same evidence.          A document entitled\n\n“Exchange Agreement” was entered into evidence in the first suit. A pertinent\n\nparagraph reads:\n\n       Patriot Title desires to contribute its accounts receivable and\n       records described herein, and Hendricks desires to commit to\n       certain services described herein, in exchange for issuance to MRO\n       of a 20% interest in Trio and a 10% interest in Community Title on\n       the terms and conditions set forth in this Exchange Agreement.\n\nPatriot’s replevin petition alleged Trio acquired the $29,204 from the accounts\n\nreceivable Patriot transferred. Thus, this paragraph—from the contract involved\n\nin the first suit—directly addresses the property Patriot now contends is in the\n\npossession of Trio. This demonstrates that both suits “share a common nucleus\n\nof operative facts and are closely related in time, space, origin, and motivation.”\n\nPavone, 807 N.W.2d at 836. It is therefore clear the conduct on the part of Trio,\n\f                                           12\n\n\nnamely, its role in acquiring the accounts receivable and subsequent collection,\n\nwould be at issue in both suits.6\n\n       Additionally, exhibits entered by Patriot show the various accounts\n\nreceivable it transferred to Trio. These include emails, spread sheets, and other\n\nrelated documents. Therefore, the evidence supporting both the replevin and the\n\nbreach of contract claims, in addition to the actions on the part of Trio, are the\n\nsame, which indicates Patriot had the opportunity to fully litigate its claims. See\n\nid.\n\n       We agree with Patriot’s assertion it would have had to set forth alternative\n\nand somewhat contradictory theories were it to argue Trio was in wrongful\n\npossession of Patriot’s property. However, parties are free to allege alternative\n\nremedies, such as, in the event the factfinder concludes no contract was formed,\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled to restitution. See generally Hartford-Carlisle Sav. Bank v.\n\nVan Zee, 569 N.W.2d 386, 390–91 (Iowa Ct. App. 1997) (noting a plaintiff is\n\nentitled to pursue consistent alternative remedies). Therefore, Patriot was not\n\nprevented in the first suit from bringing its claim on an alternative theory of\n\nrecovery with regard to the money collected on the transferred accounts\n\nreceivable.\n\n       Given these conclusions, both the protected right, in the form of Patriot’s\n\nalleged property, as well as the underlying evidence involved in both claims, are\n\n\n6\n   We do note the purpose of introducing into evidence the specific action of Trio\nacquiring the accounts receivable differs between the two claims—in the first suit, it was\nintroduced to show Trio received consideration for its performance, and in the second, it\nis the underlying wrong. Nonetheless, the record establishes the actions on the part of\nTrio during the merger are essential to Patriot’s claims. Given that even claims with\ndiffering underlying facts can be barred by claim preclusion, this fact does not change\nour analysis. See Pavone, 807 N.W.2d at 835–36.\n\f                                        13\n\n\nthe same.    Though the remedies sought in each suit differ, claim preclusion\n\nextinguishes “all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with\n\nrespect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions,\n\nout of which the action arose.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24 (2012).\n\nConsequently, Patriot had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate its claims in\n\nthe first suit, and the doctrine of claim preclusion bars litigation of its second\n\npetition. See Pavone, 807 N.W.2d at 836; but see Whalen, 621 N.W.2d at 683–\n\n85 (holding claim preclusion did not bar the plaintiff’s second suit alleging\n\nconversion because he did not have the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the\n\nclaim until the defendant wrongfully withheld the company’s stock, which did not\n\noccur until the district court decided in the first suit the amount of money the\n\ndefendant owed to the plaintiff). We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nthe motion to dismiss filed by Trio.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Patriot asserts the court erred in finding claim\n\npreclusion prohibited Patriot from bringing its current claim of replevin, arguing\n\nthat the replevin action could not have been brought in the first breach of contract\n\nsuit due to the statutory prohibition of joining other claims with a replevin cause of\n\naction. It further asserts the replevin claim was not ripe until after the verdict was\n\nrendered in the contract case and, additionally, that the two suits involve different\n\nunderlying facts, which prevents the doctrine of claim preclusion from barring its\n\npresent suit. While acknowledging a replevin action could not have been joined\n\nwith the breach of contract case, we agree with the district court that a claim for\n\nconversion could have been asserted in the prior litigation. Moreover, because\n\nboth suits involve the same underlying transactions, facts, and evidence, claim\n\npreclusion bars Patriot from bringing its current replevin action. Consequently,\n\nthe district court properly granted Trio’s motion, and we affirm.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Patriot and Trio are two businesses that provide various services in\n\nconnection with real estate transactions. From June 1, 2010, to November 30,\n\n2010, the two businesses attempted to merge.              During this time Patriot\n\ntransferred various assets to Trio, such as accounts receivable, client lists, and\n\nworks in progress.\n\f                                           3\n\n\n       On March 4, 2011, Patriot filed suit against Trio, alleging Trio had\n\nbreached the contracts that had been established between the parties.1\n\nSpecifically, count one of the amended petition alleged:\n\n               In May, 2010, Plaintiffs entered into an Exchange and\n       Contribution Agreement (attached as Exhibit 1), Employment\n       Agreement (attached as Exhibit 2), and Operating Agreement for\n       Community Title, L.L.C. (attached as Exhibit 3).\n               Consideration was exchanged between the parties in\n       execution of the contracts.\n               Plaintiffs have performed in accordance with the terms of the\n       contract.\n               Defendants have breached the contracts.\n               The breach of the contract has caused damage to the\n       Plaintiffs.\n\nCount three stated:\n\n               On May 12, 2010, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a\n       written contract whereby Plaintiffs’ businesses would merge with\n       those of the Defendants, and Plaintiff Charles Hendricks would\n       begin employment with the newly merged business. Please see\n       Exhibit 4, attached hereto and incorporated herewith.\n               Plaintiffs have performed in accordance with the terms of the\n       contract.\n               Defendants have breached the contract.\n               The breach of the contract has caused damage to the\n       Plaintiffs.\n\nThe petition also alleged a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\n       A jury trial was held from April 9, 2012, to April 13, 2012, in which Patriot\n\nsubmitted various documents showing it had transferred to Trio specific accounts\n\nreceivable. These exhibits were submitted for the purpose of demonstrating the\n\ncontract consideration offered by Patriot. It then requested judgment be entered\n\n\n1\n The merger also involved another company, Community Title, L.L.C., located in South\nDakota. It, along with two individuals, were named as defendants in the first lawsuit.\nThey were not parties to the second suit, nor are they involved in the present appeal.\nThe first suit also named Charles Hendricks, the owner of Patriot, as a plaintiff, but he\nwas not named in the second suit.\n\f                                           4\n\n\n“for the full and fair amount of the damages sustained . . . as well as any other\n\nrelief which this Court deems just and necessary.”            Following the close of\n\nevidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defense, specifically finding\n\nno contracts had been created and there was no fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, Patriot filed a second suit against Trio.             The\n\npetition alleged a claim for replevin and a conversion claim.2 Specifically, the\n\nreplevin claim stated:\n\n              Defendant remains in possession of funds held in a\n       segregated bank account known to Defendant as Patriot Title\n       Capital Clearing Account.\n              To Plaintiff’s best knowledge, $29,204.00 is currently held in\n       the Patriot Title Capital Clearing Account.\n              Funds in the Patriot Title Capital Clearing Account were\n       collected by Defendant from accounts receivable transferred by\n       Patriot Title to Trio Solutions as part of the failed merger, and were\n       not returned after the merger failed.\n              The particular funds in the account were neither taken on the\n       order or judgment of a court against the Plaintiff nor under an\n       execution or attachment against the Plaintiff or against the property.\n              Plaintiff is entitled to recover $29,204.00 in the account, as\n       well as additional amounts for the loss of use of the property while\n       held by Defendant.\n\n       On December 18, 2012, Trio filed a motion to dismiss alleging, in part, that\n\nclaim preclusion barred Patriot’s second suit. A hearing on the matter was held,\n\nand the district court granted the motion to dismiss,3 finding the doctrine of claim\n\npreclusion prevented Patriot from bringing its current action. The court stated:\n\n       Patriot probably could not have asserted a replevin claim in the\n       prior litigation since such a claim, under Iowa Code section 643.2,\n\n2\n  The district court granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety, and Patriot does not\npursue any arguments related to the conversion claim on appeal.\n3\n  The district court noted that it considered the motion to dismiss filed by Trio in the\nalternative as a motion for summary judgment, considering it took judicial notice of the\ncourt documents from the previous suit and therefore was viewing evidence outside of\nthe pleadings.\n\f                                           5\n\n\n       cannot be joined with any other type of claim. But Patriot’s instant\n       replevin claim is for the return of money and damages for the loss\n       of its use. A replevin claim is not the only way, if it is a way at all, to\n       recover money. It seems to the court that Patriot could have\n       recovered the money on a claim of unjust enrichment or restitution\n       . . . . Beyond this, Patriot certainly could have recovered the money\n       by making its conversion claim in the prior litigation. Finally, Patriot\n       did assert a fraud claim against Trio in the prior litigation. Such a\n       claim does not argue for the existence of a contract and surely,\n       under that claim, Patriot could have recovered what it seeks in this\n       case.\n\nPatriot filed a motion to reconsider and another hearing was held, in which the\n\ncourt also took into consideration the transcript from the previous trial.           In a\n\nwritten ruling filed June 26, 2013, the court denied Patriot’s motion, stating it had\n\nconsidered all of the parties’ arguments and reiterating its conclusion that claim\n\npreclusion applied. Patriot appeals.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\n       We review rulings on motions for summary judgment or motions to dismiss\n\nfor correction of errors at law. Wallace v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty.

Claim Preclusion\n\n       The doctrine of claim preclusion bars the initiation of a second suit where\n\nthe plaintiff has already had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate all claims\n\nassociated with the transactions underlying the case.         Pavone v. Kirke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (Iowa 2011).         Even where specific issues have not been\n\nlitigated, if the party could have brought the cause of action in the first suit, claim\n\npreclusion prohibits a second suit alleging the claim. Id. Furthermore:\n\n       To establish claim preclusion a party must show: (1) the parties in\n       the first and second action are the same parties or parties in privity,\n       (2) there was a final judgment on the merits in the first action, and\n       (3) the claim in the second suit could have been fully and fairly\n       adjudicated in the prior case (i.e., both suits involve the same\n       cause of action).\n\nId. at 836.\n\n       In deciding whether the claim could have been fully and fairly adjudicated\n\nin the prior suit, we consider (1) the protected right, (2) the alleged wrong, and\n\n(3) the relevant evidence. Id. Thus, where the same evidence supports both\n\ncauses of action, and the defendant’s actions underlying both suits are the same,\n\nthe third element is satisfied and claim preclusion likely applies. Id.\n\n       With regard to the purpose of the doctrine:\n\n       The policy of the law underlying claim preclusion is that a claim\n       cannot be split or tried piecemeal. Thus, a party must try all issues\n       growing out of the claim at one time and not in separate actions.\n       An adjudication in a prior action between the same parties on the\n       same claim is final as to all issues that could have been presented\n       to the court for determination. Simply put, a party is not entitled to\n       a “second bite” simply by alleging a new theory of recovery for the\n       same wrong.\n\nId. at 835–36 (internal citation omitted). In line with this rationale, our supreme\n\ncourt has noted that:\n\f                                          7\n\n\n              When any of the following circumstances exists, the general\n       [claim preclusion] rule of § 24 does not apply to extinguish the\n       claim, and part or all of the claim subsists as a possible basis for a\n       second action by the plaintiff against the defendant:\n              ....\n              The plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the\n       case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action\n       because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the\n       courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories\n       or demands for multiple remedies or forms of relief in a single\n       action, and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that\n       theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.\n\nShumaker v. Iowa Dep’t of Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239971\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239971/shumaker-v-iowa-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 853–54 (Iowa 1995)\n\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26 (1982)).\n\n       Here, the parties dispute the third element of claim preclusion, that is,\n\nwhether the replevin action could have been fully and fairly adjudicated in\n\nPatriot’s first suit alleging breach of contract. Patriot argues that, pursuant to\n\nIowa Code section 643.2 (2011), it could not have brought the replevin claim in\n\nthe first action, given it was statutorily barred from joining the replevin action with\n\nits other claims.   Trio first counters that Patriot failed to preserve error with\n\nrespect to its section 643.2 argument.        However, Trio asserts, were we to\n\nconsider the merits of this argument, the proper remedy for a misjoined action is\n\nto sever the counts and try the cases separately, and therefore Patriot still could\n\nhave brought its claim of replevin.\n\n       A. Error Preservation\n\n       As an initial matter, we will examine whether Patriot preserved error on its\n\nargument that section 643.2 barred it from bringing its replevin claim subsequent\n\nto the breach of contract action. In its ruling, the district court noted: “Patriot\n\nprobably could not have asserted a replevin claim in the prior litigation since such\n\f                                            8\n\n\na claim, under Iowa Code section 643.2, cannot be joined with any other type of\n\nclaim.” In its motion to reconsider, Patriot specifically addressed section 643.2,\n\nand the subsequent ruling noted the court “carefully considered the motion to\n\nreconsider and the arguments made by counsel.” As long as the lower court\n\nconsidered the issue and ruled on it, error is deemed to have been preserved.\n\nLamasters v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 (Iowa 2012). Therefore, the record\n\ndemonstrates the district court “considered the issue,” and we will address the\n\nmerits of Patriot’s argument. See id.\n\n       B. Iowa Code section 643.2\n\n       “Replevin is a specialized statutory remedy with a narrow purpose\n\ndesigned to restore possession of property to the party entitled to possession.”\n\nRoush v. Mahaska State Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1965120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1965120/roush-v-mahaska-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (Iowa 2000). Though damages\n\nmay be awarded, they are incidental to the purpose of a replevin action, which is\n\nto return the property to its owner.        Id.; see also Iowa Code § 643.17.           To\n\nsucceed on this claim, the plaintiff must be able to identify the specific property,\n\nprove that it owns the property, and that the defendant is in wrongful possession\n\nof it.4 See generally Flickenger v. Mark IV Apartment Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1299238\"><a href=\"/opinion/1299238/flickinger-v-mark-iv-apartments-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n796–97 (Iowa 1982).\n\n       Pursuant to Iowa Code section 643.2, no other claim may be joined to a\n\npetition alleging replevin; additionally, the defendant is not permitted to submit\n\n\n\n4\n  By contrast, to succeed on a claim of breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove:\n(1) the existence of a contract, (2) the terms and conditions of the contract, (3) that the\nplaintiff has performed all the terms and conditions required under the contract, (4) the\ndefendant’s breach of the contract in some particular way, and (5) that the plaintiff has\nsuffered damages as a result of the defendant’s breach.

This is due to the particularized nature of a replevin action,\n\nwhich is a narrow remedy designed to return the property to its rightful owner.\n\nSee Roush, 605 N.W.2d at 9.\n\n       If a claim is improperly joined, the remedy is to either sever the claims and\n\ndocket them separately, or to strike the improper claim. Id. at 10 (holding that,\n\nthough a replevin claim cannot be joined with another cause of action, the district\n\ncourt improperly dismissed the suit); see also Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.236(2) (“The only\n\nremedy for improper joinder of actions shall be by motion. On such motion the\n\ncourt shall either order the causes docketed separately or strike those causes\n\nwhich should be stricken, always retaining at least one cause docketed in the\n\noriginal case.”).\n\n       We agree with Trio’s assertion that Patriot could have sought return of the\n\nalleged wrongfully retained funds in the first suit. As set forth in more detail\n\nbelow, the claims involve the same facts, evidence, and actions of both parties.\n\nTherefore, Patriot could have alleged a conversion claim in the first suit, and, in\n\nfact, conceded at oral argument that it would have been appropriate to do so.5\n\n       Furthermore, to prove Patriot’s assertion that contracts had been formed,\n\nPatriot submitted evidence showing assets had been transferred to Trio. Ken\n\nHoyne, Trio’s comptroller, testified during trial that proceeds of Patriot’s accounts\n\nreceivable had been kept in a segregated account, which is the account Patriot\n\n\n\n5\n  We also note the asset Patriot now seeks in its replevin action is the $29,204 Trio\nobtained from the accounts receivable. However, as Patriot conceded at oral argument,\nTrio was the entity that actually worked the accounts and collected the money owed on\nthose accounts. Thus, Patriot is not seeking the asset transferred but, rather, the money\ngenerated from the accounts receivable, which were transferred to Trio during the\nattempted merger.\n\f                                         10\n\n\nnow seeks in its replevin action. However, a claim for breach of contract would\n\ninclude damages for return of property wrongfully retained through conversion of\n\nthose assets. Thus, regardless of the jury’s finding, Patriot could have attempted\n\nto prove ownership and then sought the collection proceeds of its transferred\n\naccounts receivable at the time of the breach-of-contract trial. As previously\n\nnoted, Patriot conceded it could have done this if it had amended the petition to\n\ninclude a conversion claim. Consequently, Patriot’s argument that section 643.2\n\nprevented it from bringing a replevin action for those very assets is barred by\n\nclaim preclusion.\n\n       C. Ripeness\n\n       Patriot, in the alternative, argues its claim of replevin was not ripe at the\n\ntime of the first suit because Trio did not unlawfully possess its property until the\n\njury decided there was no contract.       A claim is ripe if it presents an actual,\n\npresent controversy, and can be adjudicated when the suit is brought. See Iowa\n\nCoal Mining Co. v. Monroe Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1721111\"><a href=\"/opinion/1721111/iowa-coal-min-co-v-monroe-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (Iowa 1996).                Trio\n\npossessed money it collected on the transferred accounts receivable at the time\n\nof the first suit, and though its alleged unlawful possession of the property was\n\nnot part of Patriot’s original claims, Patriot could have plead, in the alternative, a\n\nclaim of conversion. See Whalen v. Connelly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (Iowa 2000)\n\n(noting the doctrine of election of remedies did not bar the plaintiff’s conversion\n\nclaim when the defendant wrongfully withheld the plaintiff’s stock in the\n\ncompany).    Consequently, as discussed above, Patriot could have brought a\n\nclaim at the time of the first suit to prove ownership of the proceeds of the\n\naccounts receivable, regardless of whether it knew about the specific account\n\f                                           11\n\n\ncreated by Trio containing the $29,204.         Therefore, a justiciable controversy\n\nexisted at the time of the first suit, and Patriot’s argument that it was unable to\n\nbring the claim because it was not ripe fails. See Iowa Coal Mining Co., 555\n\nN.W.2d at 432.\n\n       D. Underlying Claims\n\n       Patriot’s final argument contends it did not have the opportunity to fully\n\nand fairly litigate its claim of replevin in the first action, due to the contrary nature\n\nof the theories, and the fact different evidence supports each claim. However,\n\nwe agree with the district court that Patriot’s current claim involves the same\n\nfacts, evidence, and underlying transactions, and therefore it could have alleged\n\nan alternative remedy—conversion—in its first suit, which may have resulted in\n\nawarding Patriot the $29,204 Trio collected from the accounts receivable.\n\n       Primarily, both suits involve the same evidence.          A document entitled\n\n“Exchange Agreement” was entered into evidence in the first suit. A pertinent\n\nparagraph reads:\n\n       Patriot Title desires to contribute its accounts receivable and\n       records described herein, and Hendricks desires to commit to\n       certain services described herein, in exchange for issuance to MRO\n       of a 20% interest in Trio and a 10% interest in Community Title on\n       the terms and conditions set forth in this Exchange Agreement.\n\nPatriot’s replevin petition alleged Trio acquired the $29,204 from the accounts\n\nreceivable Patriot transferred. Thus, this paragraph—from the contract involved\n\nin the first suit—directly addresses the property Patriot now contends is in the\n\npossession of Trio. This demonstrates that both suits “share a common nucleus\n\nof operative facts and are closely related in time, space, origin, and motivation.”\n\nPavone, 807 N.W.2d at 836. It is therefore clear the conduct on the part of Trio,\n\f                                           12\n\n\nnamely, its role in acquiring the accounts receivable and subsequent collection,\n\nwould be at issue in both suits.6\n\n       Additionally, exhibits entered by Patriot show the various accounts\n\nreceivable it transferred to Trio. These include emails, spread sheets, and other\n\nrelated documents. Therefore, the evidence supporting both the replevin and the\n\nbreach of contract claims, in addition to the actions on the part of Trio, are the\n\nsame, which indicates Patriot had the opportunity to fully litigate its claims. See\n\nid.\n\n       We agree with Patriot’s assertion it would have had to set forth alternative\n\nand somewhat contradictory theories were it to argue Trio was in wrongful\n\npossession of Patriot’s property. However, parties are free to allege alternative\n\nremedies, such as, in the event the factfinder concludes no contract was formed,\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled to restitution. See generally Hartford-Carlisle Sav. Bank v.\n\nVan Zee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1833145\"><a href=\"/opinion/1833145/hartford-carlisle-sav-bank-v-van-zee/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390–91 (Iowa Ct. App. 1997) (noting a plaintiff is\n\nentitled to pursue consistent alternative remedies). Therefore, Patriot was not\n\nprevented in the first suit from bringing its claim on an alternative theory of\n\nrecovery with regard to the money collected on the transferred accounts\n\nreceivable.\n\n       Given these conclusions, both the protected right, in the form of Patriot’s\n\nalleged property, as well as the underlying evidence involved in both claims, are\n\n\n6\n   We do note the purpose of introducing into evidence the specific action of Trio\nacquiring the accounts receivable differs between the two claims—in the first suit, it was\nintroduced to show Trio received consideration for its performance, and in the second, it\nis the underlying wrong. Nonetheless, the record establishes the actions on the part of\nTrio during the merger are essential to Patriot’s claims. Given that even claims with\ndiffering underlying facts can be barred by claim preclusion, this fact does not change\nour analysis. See Pavone, 807 N.W.2d at 835–36.\n\f                                        13\n\n\nthe same.    Though the remedies sought in each suit differ, claim preclusion\n\nextinguishes “all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with\n\nrespect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions,\n\nout of which the action arose.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24 (2012).\n\nConsequently, Patriot had the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate its claims in\n\nthe first suit, and the doctrine of claim preclusion bars litigation of its second\n\npetition. See Pavone, 807 N.W.2d at 836; but see Whalen, 621 N.W.2d at 683–\n\n85 (holding claim preclusion did not bar the plaintiff’s second suit alleging\n\nconversion because he did not have the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the\n\nclaim until the defendant wrongfully withheld the company’s stock, which did not\n\noccur until the district court decided in the first suit the amount of money the\n\ndefendant owed to the plaintiff). We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nthe motion to dismiss filed by Trio.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
