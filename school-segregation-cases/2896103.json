He brought\nsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the East Brunswick\nSchool District’s policy prohibiting faculty participation in\nstudent-initiated prayer was unconstitutionally overbroad and\nvague, and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to\n\n                                4\n\ffreedom of speech, academic freedom, freedom of association,\nand due process. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey declared the policy\nunconstitutional on all grounds, and it additionally held that\nBorden’s silent acts would not violate the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment. However, we hold that the policy is\nnot unconstitutional on its face or as applied to Borden.\nAdditionally, we hold that Borden’s silent acts violate the\nEstablishment Clause because, when viewing the acts in light of\nBorden’s twenty-three years of prior prayer activities with the\nEast Brunswick High School football team during which he\norganized, participated in, and even led prayer activities with his\nteam, a reasonable observer would conclude that Borden was\nendorsing religion when he engaged in these acts. Therefore,\nand for the reasons set forth in further detail below, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order.\n\n                                I.\n\n                       A. Factual History\n\n                 1. 1983-2005 (Pre-litigation)\n\n       Marcus Borden is the head football coach at East\nBrunswick High School (“EBHS”), and he has held that position\nsince 1983.1 During his tenure at EBHS, Borden engaged in two\npre-game prayer activities that occurred (1) at the team dinner;\nand (2) while taking a knee in the locker room.\n\n\n       1\n        Borden is also a tenured teacher of Spanish at EBHS.\n\n                                5\n\f        As part of the pre-game activities for the EBHS football\nteam, the team ate a pasta dinner together at approximately\n3:00 p.m. on game day in the high school cafeteria. In addition\nto the team, parents and other guests, including the cheerleading\nsquad, were present. Prior to the time Borden coached the team\nto 1997, a local minister, Reverend Smith, said a pre-meal\nprayer. However, in 1997, the athletic director told Borden that\nReverend Smith could not continue to say the prayer. Instead,\nReverend Smith wrote a prayer that the students took turns\nreading. Then, in 2003, Reverend Smith retired, and Borden did\nnot continue to have the students read Reverend Smith’s prayer.\nBorden instead began a new tradition: he said the prayer prior to\nthe first pre-game dinner of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 seasons.\nFor the subsequent weeks of those seasons, Borden asked those\nattending the dinner to “please stand,” and chose a senior player\nto say a prayer.\n\n        In addition to the prayer before the team dinner, Borden\nled his team in a prayer immediately before the game. Prior to\ntaking the field, Borden and his assistant coaches asked the\nplayers to take a knee in the locker room. The team gathered in\nfront of the chalkboard or dry erase board on one knee, and at\nthat time, Borden discussed the tactics and strategy for that\nparticular game. Following that discussion, Borden led the team\nin a prayer. Borden described an example of the prayer he said\nas follows:\n\n       “[D]ear lord, please guide us today in our quest in\n       our game, our championship. Give us the courage\n       and determination that we would need to come\n       out successful. Please let us represent our\n\n                               6\n\f       families and our community well. Lastly, please\n       guide our players and opponents so that they can\n       come out of this game unscathed, [and] no one is\n       hurt.”\n\nThe team participated in this tradition for twenty-three seasons,\nbeginning when Borden became the coach of the EBHS football\nteam in 1983 and continuing until the 2005 football season.\n\n        On September 26, 2005, Jo Ann Magistro, the\nSuperintendent of the East Brunswick School District (“School\nDistrict”), received a complaint from a parent about the prayer\nat the team dinner. The parent told Magistro that she thought it\nwas inappropriate that Borden requested that everyone stand for\nthe prayer and that he bowed his head during the prayer. Over\nthe course of that week, two other parents complained to\nMagistro about the prayer. One of the complaining parents had\na son on the team, and the parent told Magistro that her son felt\nuncomfortable during the prayer and feared that the coach would\nselect him to say the prayer.\n\n        Although Magistro did not contact Borden herself, the\nEBHS principal and athletic director contacted Borden about\nthese complaints. They told him not to lead the team in prayer,\nand he responded that he did not lead them in prayer. At the\nteam dinner on September 30, 2005, he continued the prayer\ntraditions in the manner described above. It was alleged that he\ntold the students that if they felt uncomfortable during the\nprayer, they could wait in the restroom until it was over.\nFollowing that game, Magistro received several more\ncomplaints.\n\n                               7\n\f        On October 6, 2005, the School District’s counsel, Martin\nPachman, advised Magistro and the East Brunswick Board of\nEducation (“Board”) regarding Borden’s conduct, stating that a\ncoach for the school could not lead, encourage, or participate in\nstudent prayer. Magistro met with Borden the next day,\nOctober 7, 2005, and told him that all prayer needed to be\nstudent initiated, including the selection of which student would\nrecite the prayer. At that time, Borden asked her if he could\ncontinue to say the pre-game prayer in the locker room. In\nresponse, Magistro contacted Pachman, who answered Borden’s\nquestions. At the end of the conversation, Magistro asked\nPachman to provide clear guidelines on faculty participation in\nstudent prayer.\n\n        Later that day, Magistro sent Borden a memorandum and\nattached the guidelines provided by Pachman. Magistro stated\nthat she recognized Borden’s disappointment, but she expected\nhim to comply with the guidelines, and “[n]ot to comply will be\nviewed as insubordination.” The attached guidelines, which\nstated that they were not “exhaustive or final,” were as follows:\n\n       “1.    Students have a constitutional right to\n              engage in prayer on school property, at\n              school events, and even during the course\n              of the school day, provided that:\n\n              A.     The activity is truly student\n                     initiated; and\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f     B.     The prayer activity does not\n            interfere with the normal operations\n            of the school district.\n\n     This would mean that, for example, if a\n     student or a group of students wish to\n     engage in a prayer before or after their\n     meal in the cafeteria during their lunch\n     period they would have a right to do so,\n     provided that the activity in which they are\n     engaged does not disrupt the normal\n     operation and decorum of the other\n     students eating in the cafeteria. Also, if\n     student athletes on their own decide to\n     hold a prayer huddle before a game, after\n     a game, or during half-time, they have a\n     right to do so.\n\n2.   Neither the school district nor any\n     representative of the school district\n     (teacher, coach, administrator, board\n     member, etc.) may constitutionally\n     encourage, lead, initiate, mandate, or\n     otherwise coerce, directly or indirectly,\n     student prayer at any time in any school-\n     sponsored setting, including classes,\n     practices, pep rallies, team meetings, or\n     athletic events.\n\n3.   Representatives of the school district, as\n     referenced above, cannot participate in\n\n                      9\n\f             student-initiated prayer. That very issue\n             was decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of\n             Appeals in a decision cited with approval\n             by the United States Supreme Court and is,\n             therefore, the operative law of the land at\n             this time. To quote the Court, ‘If while\n             acting in their official capacities (school\n             district) employees join hands in a prayer\n             circle or otherwise manifest approval and\n             solidarity with student religious exercises,\n             they cross the line between respect for\n             religion and endorsement of religion,’ and\n             such conduct was prohibited.”2\n\nThat same evening, Borden resigned, effective immediately, and\nhe did not attend the football game scheduled for that evening.\nHowever, on October 17, 2005, Borden withdrew his resignation\nand agreed to abide by the School District’s policy for the\nremainder of the 2005 season.\n\n       The Board held a meeting on October 20, 2005. Michael\nBaker, the president of the Board, read a prepared statement\n(“the Board’s statement”). In full, it read:\n\n             “I want to take this opportunity on behalf\n      of the Board of Education, to make some remarks\n      regarding the events that have transpired with our\n      football coach. First and foremost, Dr. Magistro\n\n      2\n       A similar memorandum was sent out to the entire staff\non October 10.\n\n                              10\n\fhas acted professionally, appropriately and\nrespectfully. She has represented the district and\nthe Board of Education with dignity and class.\nWe sincerely thank her and appreciate the way\nshe has conducted herself. We have instructed\nDr. Magistro to get on with running the district\nand to defer any continuing distractions in this\nmatter to our attorney, Mr. Pachman[,] or to the\nBoard of Education.\n\n        Coach Borden, after reconsidering his\ndecision, has rescinded his resignation and\ncontinues as coach of the team. He will conduct\nhimself in a manner that is in compliance with the\nlaw. We do not believe that there was any\ndeliberate attempt or motive from him to do\notherwise. We respect the rights of any employee\nto disagree with policies, procedures and legal\ninterpretations, but cannot and will not tolerate\nviolations of these rules by any employee of the\ndistrict. Each of us up here, are elected to serve\nthis community and take an oath of office to\nrespect and defend the Constitution of the United\nStates and there is no ambiguity or gray area for\nus in understanding this oath. We will, whenever\nconfronted, follow the laws of our land regardless\nof personal views or interpretations of these laws.\nOur employees will do the same. It is our\nuncompromising expectation that Coach Borden’s\npersonal agenda along with his lawyer[’]s, does\nnot in any way interfere with this school district.\n\n                        11\n\fThe Board of Education will continue to see that\nour schools run at the highest of standards and\nwith complete respect for the law and for the\nrights of all of our students and staff. Any\ncomments that come from sources other than the\nBoard of Education, our counsel or the\nSuperintendent are not official and therefore not\nnecessarily representative of our position.\n\n       We are a divided nation and have been\nsince the ratification of our Constitution in 1791.\nIssues of faith are personal and divisive today as\nthey were back then.           This meeting and\nsubsequent [Board of Education] meetings are not\nthe forum for such debate, and legal\n[c]onstitutional rulings are not the purview of the\nBoard of Education. Congress, the President and\nthe Supreme Court[] make, enforce and interpret\nthe laws and these branches of [g]overnment are\nthe appropriate places to lobby for one’s position\non these matters, not here. This is not a platform\nfor individual agendas on [c]onstitutional cases\nthat have already been clearly decided. I will\ntherefore preside over this meeting this evening\nwith these thoughts in mind.\n\n         One of the foundations of our democracy\nis that the right of someone to express concern or\nto bring a matter of discomfort to the attention of\nauthority is to be respected and protected. It is\nnot to be vilified and dishonored. Some of the\n\n                        12\n\f       extreme language, hateful emails and\n       inappropriate and inaccurate reporting of this\n       story, has shifted blame onto the blameless and\n       has distorted beyond measure the matter at hand.\n       If we can do one thing together as a community,\n       it should be to stand up in vast numbers and\n       express outrage and concern against those who\n       would cheapen the actions of brave and\n       committed Americans. No person should have to\n       be afraid to express their constitutionally\n       protected individual rights. Hopefully, we can all\n       learn from this experience and move forward with\n       dignity and respect for each other. Thank you.”3\n\nFollowing the issuance of the October 7 guidelines and the\nBoard’s statement on October 20, Borden conducted himself in\naccordance with the School District’s new policy for the balance\nof the school year, notwithstanding the litigation he instituted on\nNovember 21, 2005.\n\n                        2. 2006-Present\n\n        Prior to the 2006 football season, Borden sent an email\nto Sergio Garcia and Randall Nixon, the co-captains of the team\nfor the 2006 season, requesting that they ask the players whether\nthey would like to continue the tradition of praying at the team\n\n       3\n        Following the media hype created by this case, EBHS\nstudent internet message boards were bombarded with posts,\nseveral of which included derogatory comments based on\nreligion and race.\n\n                                13\n\fdinner and prior to the game. In his email request, he told the\nco-captains that “[w]hatever the players decide to do is fine with\nme.” He asked the captains to pass on the players’ response and\nto ensure him that they spoke with all of the players on the team.\nNixon’s response indicated that the players voted to continue\nboth the pre-meal and pre-game prayer. Following the grant of\nsummary judgment in his favor in this case, Borden stood and\nbowed his head during the prayer before the meal, and remained\non one knee during the pre-game prayer.\n\n                     B. Procedural History\n\n        On November 21, 2005, Borden instituted this litigation\nagainst the School District, the Board of Education, and\nMagistro in her capacity as Superintendent (collectively, “the\ndefendants”) in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The\ndefendants removed the suit to the United States District Court\nfor the District of New Jersey on December 22, 2005. Rather\nthan seeking to continue to do what he had done for the previous\ntwenty-three years, Borden sought “to show his respect for his\nplayers, respect for The Team Prayers, and respect for East\nBrunswick’s football tradition by engaging in two silent acts\nduring The Team Prayers: (i) bowing his head during grace; and\n(ii) taking a knee with his team in the locker room.” His\ncomplaint alleged that the guidelines and the Board’s statement\nprevented him from undertaking either of these activities.\n\n        Borden’s complaint presented two causes of action.\nUnder Count 1, Borden alleged that the defendants violated his\nrights as embodied in Articles 1, 4, 6 and 18 of the New Jersey\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fConstitution.4 Count 2 alleged that the defendants violated his\nDue Process and Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. For both of these\ncounts, Borden sought the same relief: (1) a declaratory\njudgment stating that the guidelines issued on October 7 and the\nBoard’s statement on October 20 were unconstitutional based on\nthe respective constitutional provisions; (2) preliminary and\npermanent injunctions preventing the defendants from enforcing\nthe guidelines and the Board’s statement, or from “taking any\naction of any kind, by way of complaint or otherwise, against\nCoach Borden” for his silent acts of bowing his head and taking\na knee during the team’s prayers; and (3) an order vacating the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement.\n\n        The School District filed a motion for summary judgment\nthat primarily focused on whether its policy was proper under\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence, arguing that it did not violate\nthe Free Exercise Clause, and its policy was necessary because\nBorden’s prayer activities violated the Establishment Clause.\nBorden filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, and\n\n       4\n        In fact, it appears that Borden was not referring to\nArticles of the New Jersey Constitution, but paragraphs under\nArticle 1. While Article 1 of the New Jersey Constitution\nestablishes individual rights, Article 4 establishes the powers of\nthe New Jersey Legislature, Article 6 establishes the powers of\nthe judiciary in New Jersey, and Article 18 does not exist. In\ncontrast, the relevant paragraphs of Article 1 provide the\nfollowing rights: liberty (para. 1), free exercise of religion (para.\n4), freedom of speech (para. 6), and freedom of association\n(para. 18). See N.J. Const. art 1, ¶¶ 1, 4, 6, 18.\n\n                                 15\n\fexpressly stated that he was not asserting a claim under the Free\nExercise Clause despite his citation of paragraph 4 of the New\nJersey Constitution in his complaint. Borden argued that “his\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment United States constitutional\nrights as well as Article 1 ¶¶ 1, 6 of his New Jersey\nconstitutional rights” protect his “symbolic conduct.”5 Further,\nBorden argued that the School District’s justification for its\npolicy was based on an erroneous interpretation of the\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n\n       5\n        Borden did not specifically assert a claim as to his rights\nunder the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nHis complaint did, however, state a claim as to his Due Process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution. Thus, Borden arguably asserted a claim under the\nFirst Amendment because an individual’s free speech rights\nunder the First Amendment apply to the states through the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gitlow v.\nNew York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 (1925). The defendants have not\nargued that Borden did not assert a claim under the First\nAmendment. Even if they had, however, it would not change\nour analysis, because Borden stated a claim under the free\nspeech clause of the New Jersey Constitution, which has\nprotections that are “generally interpreted as co-extensive with\nthe First Amendment.” Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, 733 A.2d\n1159, 1169 (N.J. 1999) (citing Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v.\nVerniero, 716 A.2d 1137 (N.J. 1998)). Thus, while we do not\nreach a conclusion on whether he stated a free speech claim\nunder the First Amendment, we will assume that he did for the\npurposes of our analysis.\n\n                                16\n\f       On July 25, 2006, the District Court heard oral argument\non the summary judgment motions, and following argument,\nJudge Cavanaugh entered his decision on the record from the\nbench. He stated:\n\n      “I agree that an Establishment Clause violation\n      would occur if the coach initiated and led the\n      activity, but I find nothing wrong with remaining\n      silent and bowing one’s head and taking a knee as\n      a sign of respect for his players’ actions and\n      traditions, nor do I believe would a reasonable\n      observer.\n\n             I believe to preclude the Plaintiff from\n      such an action would be a violation of his rights.\n      I believe the Directives as stated are overbroad\n      and vague. To threaten the Plaintiff with\n      insubordination if he is to participate places him\n      in an untenable position.\n\n             I find that the Plaintiff’s request to bow his\n      head in silence and take a knee do not violate the\n      Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\n              I find, further, that the Defendants’\n      directive regarding the Plaintiff’s nonparticipation\n      is over broad and vague, and violates the\n      Plaintiff’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights\n      to free speech, freedom of association, academic\n      freedom, as well as New Jersey’s constitutional\n      rights to liberty and free speech.\n\n                               17\n\f              Accordingly, since there are no issues of\n       material fact left in dispute, as a matter of law, I\n       deny the Defendants’ motion and grant the\n       Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.”\n\nOn July 26, 2006, the District Court entered an order denying\nthe defendants’ motion for summary judgment, granting\nBorden’s cross-motion for summary judgment, and awarding\nBorden costs and counsel fees. The defendants’ timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                II.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367(a). We have\njurisdiction over final judgments of the District Court under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.6 We exercise plenary review over a district\n\n       6\n        Borden argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this\nappeal because it has become moot. He argues that he only\nsought relief for the 2006 season, and because his coaching\ncontract is subject to annual renewal, a live controversy, as\nrequired by Article III, Section 2 of the United States\nConstitution, no longer exists. However, this appeal contains\nthe factors necessary to warrant a finding that it is not moot. See\nCity of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 288 (2000). First, the\nSchool District has an ongoing injury. See id. at 288; see also\nCongregation Kol Ami v. Abington Twp., 309 F.3d 120, 132 (3d\nCir. 2002). The District Court’s decision did not pertain to the\n2006 season alone. Instead, the District Court found that the\nguidelines were overbroad and vague, which invalidates the\n\n                                18\n\fcourt’s grant of summary judgment, and will uphold the district\ncourt’s grant of a summary judgment motion on any basis so\nlong as that basis was previously presented to the district court.\nNasir v. Morgan, 350 F.3d 366, 368 (3d Cir. 2003). Moreover,\n“[o]ur review over constitutional issues is plenary.” United\nStates v. One Toshiba Color Television, 213 F.3d 147, 151 (3d\nCir. 2000).\n\n                               III.\n\n       The District Court found that the School District’s policy\nprohibiting faculty participation in student-initiated prayer was\nunconstitutional on its face because it was both overbroad and\n\n\nguidelines as applied to any faculty member. See Virginia v.\nHicks, 539 U.S. 113, 118-19 (2003) (stating that where a court\ndetermines that a statute or policy is overbroad, that ruling\n“invalidate[s] all enforcement of that law”). Second, Borden\ncontinues to have an interest in the present case. See Pap’s\nA.M., 529 U.S. at 288. He is likely to be rehired as the football\ncoach each year because the School District has rehired him\neach year for twenty-five consecutive years, and more\nimportantly, the School District’s guidelines affect him at all\ntimes as a tenured teacher at EBHS. Finally, “this is not a run\nof the mill voluntary cessation case . . . [because] it is the\nplaintiff who, having prevailed below, now seeks to have the\ncase declared moot.” See id. As in Pap’s A.M., we have an\ninterest in preventing litigants from “manipulat[ing] the Court’s\njurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review.” Id.\nTherefore, the case before us is not moot, and we have\njurisdiction to review it.\n\n                               19\n\fvague. It also found that the policy was unconstitutional in its\napplication to Borden because it violated Borden’s constitutional\nrights to freedom of speech, academic freedom, freedom of\nassociation, and due process. Finally, it found that Borden’s\nrequested silent acts of bowing his head and taking a knee while\nhis team prayed would not violate the Establishment Clause.\nWe address each of these issues in turn.\n\n               A. Overbreadth and Vagueness\n\n      Borden challenged the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement on their face, arguing that they are unconstitutionally\noverbroad and vague. The District Court agreed. For the\nreasons that follow, the District Court’s conclusions are\nerroneous.\n\n                        1. Overbreadth\n\n        Under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, a\nperson may challenge a statute or policy, even though it is not\nunconstitutional as applied to that particular person, because\n“[its] very existence may cause others not before the court to\nrefrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.”\nBroadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973). A court\nmust consider that the overbreadth doctrine is “strong medicine”\nthat should be used “sparingly and only as a last resort.” Id. at\n613. As a result, “a single impermissible application” is\ninsufficient to deem a statute or policy invalid, New York v.\nFerber, 458 U.S. 747, 772 (1982) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted), and instead, “a law should not be invalidated\n\n\n\n                               20\n\ffor overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number of\nimpermissible applications.” Id. at 771.\n\n       Thus, the proper inquiry is whether a statute or policy\n“prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.”\nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 244 (2002).\nTo determine how broad the statute or policy sweeps, we look\nto four factors: (1) “the number of valid applications,” (2) “the\nhistoric or likely frequency of conceivably impermissible\napplications,” (3) “the nature of the activity or conduct sought\nto be regulated,” and (4) “the nature of the state interest\nunderlying the regulation.” Gibson v. Mayor & Council of\nWilmington, 355 F.3d 215, 226 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Based upon the Gibson factors, we conclude that the\nSchool District’s guidelines and the Board’s statement are not\nunconstitutionally overbroad. Borden argues that this policy\nwill reach beyond impermissible faculty involvement in prayer\nand, in addition, will prohibit permissible faculty religious\nexercise. We will address the two relevant paragraphs of the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement separately.\n\n        Paragraph two of the guidelines prohibits a school\nofficial from “encourag[ing], lead[ing], initiat[ing], mandat[ing],\nor otherwise coerc[ing]” students into prayer. For this\nparagraph, the number of valid applications is immense. The\nSupreme Court has held that a school district is in violation of\nthe Establishment Clause where “the degree of school\ninvolvement makes it clear that the [prayer activities] bear the\nimprint of the State and thus put school-age children who\n\n                                21\n\fobjected in an untenable position.” Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist.\nv. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 305 (2000) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Thus, if a school “affirmatively sponsors the\nparticular religious practice of prayer,” it is in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 313. Paragraph two of the\nguidelines strikes at the heart of this prohibition. Generally, if\na school official is engaging in student prayer to the extent that\nthey are leading it, initiating it, or requiring it, the school\nofficial, and thus the school district, is violating the\nEstablishment Clause. In fact, Borden does not point to a\npossible misapplication of this portion of the guidelines.\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has noted that “compliance with\nthe Establishment Clause is a state interest sufficiently\ncompelling to justify content-based restrictions on speech.”\nCapitol Square Review & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753,\n761-62 (1995). Therefore, paragraph two of the guidelines is\nnot unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n        Paragraph three of the guidelines prohibits a school\nofficial from “participat[ing]” in any student-initiated prayer.\nThis paragraph of the guidelines similarly has numerous valid\napplications. A school district also violates the Establishment\nClause if “a reasonable observer familiar with the history and\ncontext of the display would perceive the display as a\ngovernment endorsement of religion.” Modrovich v. Allegheny\nCounty, 385 F.3d 397, 401 (3d Cir. 2004); see also County of\nAllegheny v. Am. Civil Liberties Union Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter, 492 U.S. 573, 596 (1989) (adopting the endorsement\ntest). Not every religious display of a school official will have\nthe necessary “history and context” to be an Establishment\nClause violation, but to the extent that this paragraph is\n\n                                22\n\foverbroad, it is not so substantial as to make the guidelines\ninvalid. Rather, any concern about overbreadth may “be cured\nthrough case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its\nsanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.” Broadrick, 413 U.S.\nat 615-16. Moreover, the School District is equally as interested\nin avoiding Establishment Clause violations in this way.\nTherefore, paragraph three of the guidelines is not\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n        Borden also takes issue with the Board’s statement that\nit “cannot and will not tolerate violations of these rules by any\nemployee of the district,” arguing that the statement does not\ndescribe what conduct it prohibits. However, the statement\nbegan, “[w]e respect the rights of any employee to disagree with\npolicies, procedures and legal interpretations.” It is obvious to\nus that the rules to which the Board is referring are the recently\npromulgated guidelines that had been distributed to all faculty\nonly ten days before the October 20 meeting. Because the\nOctober 20 statement is simply referring to teachers following\nthe School District’s guidelines, the same analysis applies to it\nas to the guidelines themselves. For the same reasons, we find\nthat the Board’s statement is not unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n                          2. Vagueness\n\n        In a void-for-vagueness challenge, we must ensure that\na statute or standard is fair in that it is not so vague that a party\nwould not know what conduct is prohibited. San Filippo v.\nBongiovanni, 961 F.2d 1125, 1136 (3d Cir. 1992). Thus, a\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague when “men of common\nintelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.” Broadrick,\n\n                                 23\n\f413 U.S. at 607 (quoting Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S.\n385, 391 (1926)). The inquiry is completed on a case-by-case\nbasis, and the party opposing the statute or standard must show\nthat it is vague as applied to him. San Filippo, 961 F.2d at 1136.\nIn completing this analysis, it is important to note that, in the\ncivil context, statutes need not be as precise as in the criminal\ncontext and are, therefore, less likely to be invalidated under a\nvoid-for-vagueness challenge. Id. at 1135. Borden claims that\nthe use of the word “participate” renders the guidelines\nunconstitutionally vague. Standing alone, the word “participate”\nmay be vague. However, “participate” cannot be read in\nisolation, but must be read in the context of the entire paragraph\ndiscussing the prohibition on faculty participation with student-\ninitiated prayer. The paragraph prohibiting faculty participation\nelaborates on what it considered participation by quoting from\nthe Fifth Circuit’s decision in Doe v. Duncanville Independent\nSchool District, 70 F.3d 402 (5th Cir. 1995). Thus, the faculty,\nincluding Borden, knew that the prohibition on participating in\nprayer with students included joining hands in prayer or\ndemonstrating some approval of or solidarity with students’\nprayer. Such a description is “‘sufficiently explicit to inform\nthose who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render\nthem liable to its penalties . . . consonant alike with ordinary\nnotions of fair play and the settled rules of law.’” San Filippo,\n961 F.2d at 1136 (quoting Connally, 269 U.S. at 391).\n\n       Moreover, we find support that the word “participate” is\nnot vague from the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of\nEducation of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S.\n226 (1990). In Mergens, a school district refused access to a\nChristian student group, and the group brought suit arguing that\n\n                               24\n\fthe school district was in violation of the Equal Access Act, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 4071 et seq., which prohibits public secondary\nschools from denying equal access to student groups. 496 U.S.\nat 232-33. The school district responded that the Act violated\nthe Establishment Clause and thus was unconstitutional. Id. at\n233. However, the Court held that the Act did not violate the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 253. In reaching its decision, the\nCourt relied extensively on a provision of the Act that limited\nthe faculty involvement permissible in any student religious\ngroups to a “nonparticipatory capacity.” 496 U.S. at 236, 251-\n53 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 4071(c)(3)). The Act does not define\n“nonparticipatory capacity,” and the Court did not define it\neither. Nevertheless, the Court found that the provision\nremoved the risk of both “official state endorsement or\ncoercion,” id. at 251, and excessive entanglement with religion,\nid. at 253, because it removed the possibility that school\nofficials would be “participating” in the students’ religious\nactivities.    Considering the Court’s reliance on the\n“nonparticipatory” provision of the Act without a definition of\nwhat the word “participate” means, it is difficult to conceive\nhow the School District’s guidelines could be so vague that\npeople of common intelligence could not “guess at [their]\nmeaning.” Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 607. Therefore, for all of the\nabove reasons, we find that the guidelines are not\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n          B. As-Applied Constitutional Challenges\n\n        In addition to arguing that the policy prohibiting faculty\nparticipation in student-initiated prayer was unconstitutional on\nits face, Borden also challenged the policy as it applied to him,\n\n                               25\n\farguing that it violated his constitutional rights to freedom of\nspeech, academic freedom, freedom of association, and due\nprocess. The District Court agreed. Again, for the reasons that\nfollow, the District Court’s conclusion is erroneous.\n\n                     1. Freedom of Speech\n\n       The first issue is whether the School District’s guidelines\nand the Board’s statement violated Borden’s right to freedom of\nspeech under the New Jersey Constitution and the First\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.7 The First\nAmendment states that “Congress shall make no law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech . . . .” U.S. Const. amend. I.\nThis provision applies to the states through the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gitlow v. New York,\n268 U.S. 652, 666 (1925). The Supreme Court has held that the\nFirst Amendment prohibits the government from “regulat[ing]\nspeech based on its substantive content or the message it\nconveys.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU.S. 819, 828 (1995).\n\n       The question is whether the First Amendment protects\nBorden, the employee of a public school system, when he bows\nhis head and takes a knee with his team while they pray. As our\ncase law indicates, “the day has long since passed when\nindividuals surrendered their right to freedom of speech by\n\n       7\n       We will use federal constitutional principles of free\nspeech rights in our analysis because the free speech clause of\nthe New Jersey Constitution “is generally interpreted as co-\nextensive with the First Amendment.” Schad, 733 A.2d at 1169.\n\n                               26\n\faccepting public employment.” Sanguigni v. Pittsburgh Bd. of\nPub. Educ., 968 F.2d 393, 396 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing Connick v.\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 143-44 (1983); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,\n391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)). However, while “public employees\nenjoy substantial free speech rights,” id. at 396, those rights are\nlimited. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148-54; Pickering, 391 U.S.\nat 568.\n\n        To determine whether the First Amendment protects a\npublic employee’s speech, the Supreme Court has established a\ntwo-prong test. Under the first prong, the court must determine\nwhether the employee is speaking upon matters of public\nconcern. Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. If the employee’s speech\nrelates only to his or her personal interest, the First Amendment\ndoes not protect the speech because “government officials\nshould enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without\nintrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First\nAmendment.” Id. at 146. However, if the employee’s speech is\non a matter of public interest, the second prong is triggered and\nrequires the court to engage in the Pickering balancing test. See\nid. at 150. The balancing is “between the interests of the [public\nemployee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\nconcern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees.” Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.8 Because\n\n       8\n       We reject Borden’s argument that we should apply the\nSupreme Court’s standard in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent\nCommunity School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), rather than the\nstandard set forth in Pickering and Connick. In Tinker, the\nSupreme Court specifically identified both students and teachers\n\n                                27\n\fwe find that Borden’s speech was not on a matter of public\nconcern, we do not need to engage in the Pickering balancing\ntest.\n\n\n\n\nas those who have First Amendment rights, stating that neither\nstudents nor teachers “shed their constitutional rights to freedom\nof speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Id. at 506.\nHowever, the Court in Tinker was dealing with a question of the\nprotections given to a student’s speech, not a teacher’s speech.\nId. at 513 (holding that students have free speech rights unless\nthe student’s conduct “for any reason . . . materially disrupts\nclasswork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the\nrights of others”); see also Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,\n484 U.S. 260, 270-71 (1988) (noting that Tinker involved a\nquestion of student speech). More importantly, Tinker did not\nalter the test that the Supreme Court established to evaluate the\nspeech of a public employee in Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568, and\nthen Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. Pickering involved a teacher\nwho wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing concern regarding\nthe management of the school district, and the Court held that\nthe teacher, as a public employee, had a right to freedom of\nspeech. 391 U.S. at 574-75. Connick elaborated on the proper\ntest for the speech of a public employee. See 461 U.S. at 146-\n50. Therefore, our application of Pickering and Connick is\nappropriate in these circumstances.\n\n                               28\n\f                  i. Matter of Public Concern9\n\n        Under the test established in Pickering and Connick, we\nmust first determine whether Borden’s silent acts of expression\nare on a matter of public concern. Borden alleges two interests\nthat his silent acts serve: (1) providing the team with feelings of\nunity and increasing team morale; and (2) respecting the\nplayers’ prayers.10 For the reasons that follow, we find that\n\n       9\n         Borden argues that we may not address this issue\nbecause the defendants did not argue that the speech was not on\na matter of public concern in their initial brief or their reply brief\nbefore the District Court. However, “‘[w]hen an issue or claim\nis properly before the court, the court is not limited to the\nparticular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather\nretains the independent power to identify and apply the proper\nconstruction of governing law.’” Tenafly Eruv Assoc., Inc. v.\nBorough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 158 n.15 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(quoting Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 99\n(1991)). Thus, we must engage in a proper constitutional\nanalysis of whether Borden has a free speech right to engage in\nhis proposed silent acts regardless of what legal theory he or the\ndefendants argued at any point in this litigation. Here, a proper\nconstitutional analysis requires us to consider whether Borden’s\nspeech was on a matter of public concern before we make any\nother determinations. Therefore, not only are we not prohibited\nfrom engaging in step one of the Connick test, we must do so.\n       10\n         To the extent that Borden argues that his speech\nprotects student-initiated prayer, his argument is unfounded. He\nwould like to bow his head during a pre-meal grace and take a\n\n                                 29\n\fBorden’s stated interests are personal to Borden and his team\nand are not matters of public concern.\n\n        Connick instructs that “[w]hether an employee’s speech\naddresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the\ncontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by\nthe whole record.” 461 U.S. at 147-48.11 The content of speech\non a matter of public concern generally addresses a social or\npolitical concern of the community. For example, we have\nstated that speech is on a matter of public concern if it “relate[s]\nto broad social or policy issues,” including expressing the\ndesirability of assassinating the President or complaining about\nracial discrimination. Sanguigni, 968 F.2d at 397 (citing Rankin\nv. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 386-87 (1987); Givhan v. W. Line\nConsol. Sch. Dist., 439 U.S. 410 (1979)). We have also\ncategorized speech “implicat[ing] the discharge of public\nresponsibilities by an important government office, agency, or\ninstitution” as speech addressing a matter of public concern. See\nid. at 397-98 (citing cases involving speech that touched on the\npressure to work on political campaigns, the allocation of funds\nto certain school programs, government corruption, and the\n\n\nknee with his team before a game. These silent acts do nothing\nto protect student-initiated prayer because the students are able\nto engage in student-initiated prayer regardless of Borden’s\nsilent acts. Thus, we find his argument unavailing.\n       11\n         Contrary to Borden’s contention, this question is one of\nlaw, and thus is properly considered by a reviewing court.\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 148 n.7 (“The inquiry into the protected\nstatus of speech is one of law, not fact.”).\n\n                                30\n\flowering of academic standards and its effects); see also Holder\nv. City of Allentown, 987 F.2d 188, 195 (3d Cir. 1993) (stating\nthat speech is on a matter of public concern where “the speaker\nseeks to ‘bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach\nof public trust’ on the part of government officials” (quoting\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 148)). Finally, the content of speech is on\na matter of public concern where it “relate[s] primarily to the\nway in which a government office [i]s serving the public.”\nSanguigni, 968 F.2d at 398 (citing Czurlanis v. Albanese, 721\nF.2d 98 (3d Cir. 1983), in which a county employee criticized\nthe state and county governments at a meeting of the county’s\ngoverning body regarding how he thought those governments\nwere wasting taxpayer’s money). In short, the content of these\ntypes of speech goes to the core of the First Amendment because\nit adds to the debate on matters of public importance.\n\n        In contrast, the content of an employee’s speech is not a\nmatter of public concern where the comments are only with\nregard to the morale of the office. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148\n(holding that the employee’s questionnaire regarding office\nmorale was not a matter of public concern because she was\nmerely gathering “ammunition” against her supervisors);\nSanguigni, 968 F.2d at 399 (holding that an employee’s\nstatements regarding morale alone do not rise to the level of a\nmatter of public concern). In Connick, the Supreme Court noted\nthat the level of morale in a government office may relate to the\nefficiency of that office, and the public may be interested in that\nefficiency. 461 U.S. at 148. However, where the employee’s\nefforts did not focus on relaying that information to the public,\nit could not be speech on a matter of public concern. Id. at 148\n& n.8.\n\n                                31\n\f        In the present case, Borden portrays the content of his\nconduct as secular gestures intended to promote solidarity, help\nform the team into a cohesive family unit, and show respect for\nthe players’ prayers. The content of his message, however, is\nnot a matter of public concern. Borden does not perform these\nsilent acts as part of a broad social or policy statement of being\nable to take a knee or bow his head in public.12 Additionally, he\nis not shedding light on any matter with regard to EBHS’s\noperations that would be important to the public because his\nsilent acts do not touch upon the way in which a government\ninstitution is discharging its responsibilities. See, e.g.,\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 569-70 (finding that criticisms of a school\ndistrict’s allocations of funds is speech on a matter of public\nconcern). Instead, Borden expressly argues that he wishes to\nengage in this speech out of concern for his team’s morale.\nHowever, he is not trying to bring public morale issues within\nthe school’s administration, but is merely trying to bolster his\nteam by demonstrating that “this team is a family,” which does\nnot amount to a matter of public concern. See Connick,\nteacher’s criticism of the school district in a letter to a\nnewspaper).\n\n        In the present case, the form and context of Borden’s\nsilent acts only reinforce its non-public nature. Borden’s speech\ndoes not occur in any type of official proceeding, and even more\nimportantly, Borden’s speech does not extend into any type of\npublic forum. In fact, Borden himself admits that the bowing of\n\n       12\n        Borden does not allege that his silent acts are religious\nspeech that is on a matter of public concern, and we do not reach\nthat question.\n\n                               32\n\fhis head and taking of a knee occur in private settings, namely\nat an invitation-only dinner and in a closed locker room. Again,\nwe find further support for this decision in the Sixth Circuit’s\nopinion in Dambrot, where the court noted the private nature of\nthe coach’s message to his players because the coach’s pep talk\nwas given in a locker room for the private consumption of his\nplayers. 55 F.3d at 1188. Thus, we conclude that as in\nDambrot, the bowing of Borden’s head and taking a knee are\nmeant for the consumption of the football team only. Therefore,\nBorden’s expressive conduct of bowing his head and taking a\nknee are not matters of public concern triggering protection of\nhis right, as a public employee, to freedom of speech.13\n\n       13\n          Based on our prior decisions, as well as the decisions of\nother courts of appeals, Borden’s actions do not constitute\nspeech on a matter of public concern regardless of the\napplication of the Supreme Court’s most recent case in the line\nof cases on the free speech rights of public employees. See\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 126 S. Ct. 1951 (2006). In Garcetti, the\nCourt considered whether the First Amendment protects a public\nemployee’s speech when the employee speaks pursuant to his or\nher official duties. Id. at 1960. It held that the analysis\nestablished by Pickering and its progeny applies only when an\nemployee speaks as a citizen. Id. Thus, the First Amendment\nsimply does not protect speech made pursuant to the employee’s\nofficial duties. Id. After reaching its conclusion, the Court\nexpressly stated that it left the determination of whether this\nanalysis would apply in the educational context for another day.\nSee id. at 1962 (“We need not, and for that reason do not, decide\nwhether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same\nmanner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or\n\n                                33\n\f                 ii. Pickering Balancing Test\n\n        We find it unnecessary to engage in the Pickering\nbalancing test in the present case because Borden does not have\na free speech right that would trigger the analysis. In order to\nutilize the balancing test, the public employee must have a free\nspeech right to weigh against the government’s interest in\nprohibiting the speech. However, Borden’s silent acts of\nbowing his head and taking a knee are not on matters of public\nconcern so he does not have a free speech right to trigger the\nbalancing test. For the above reasons, we conclude that the\nguidelines and the Board’s statements did not violate Borden’s\nfree speech rights under the First Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution and under the New Jersey Constitution.\n\n                    2. Academic Freedom\n\n       Borden argues that the right to academic freedom affords\nhim the right to exercise professional judgment in teaching his\nplayers respect for others, or as he calls it, “Character\nEducation.” In making this argument, Borden specifically\npoints out that he is both a football coach and a tenured teacher\nat EBHS, and states that “[he] believes in teaching [the players]\nhow to be persons of good character and principle.”\n\n\nteaching.”). If Garcetti applied to this case, Borden’s speech\nwould not be protected as it was made pursuant to his official\nduties as a coach of the EBHS football team and not as an\nordinary citizen. However, even if Garcetti does not apply in\nthe educational context, Borden’s conduct is not on a matter of\npublic concern for the reasons just described.\n\n                               34\n\f        We have held that a teacher’s in-class conduct is not\nprotected speech. Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 F.2d\n1172, 1176 (3d Cir. 1990) (“Although a teacher’s out-of-class\nconduct, including her advocacy of particular teaching methods,\nis protected, her in-class conduct is not.” (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted)). The rationale for this holding is\nthat the teacher is acting as the educational institution’s proxy\nduring his or her in-class conduct, and the educational\ninstitution, not the individual teacher, has the final determination\nin how to teach the students. See Brown v. Armenti, 247 F.3d\n69, 74-75 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n       In order to determine if the teacher’s conduct is\nconsidered in-class conduct, we must determine whether the\nteacher is engaging in one of the “four essential freedoms” that\nconstitute academic freedom. Id. at 75. The “‘four essential\nfreedoms’” include the right of an educational institution “to\nchoose ‘who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be\ntaught, and who may be admitted to study.’” Edwards v. Cal.\nUniv. of Pa., 156 F.3d 488, 492 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Regents\nof Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 312 (1978)). Based on\nthis analysis, we have previously determined that a teacher’s in-\nclass conduct includes choosing one’s own teaching methods,\nid. at 491-92, utilizing one’s own “classroom management\ntechnique,” Bradley, 910 F.2d at 1176, and assigning grades to\na student, Brown, 247 F.3d at 75.\n\n       In the case before us, Borden concedes that the silent acts\nof bowing his head and taking a knee are tools that he uses to\nteach his players respect and good moral character. Thus, by his\nown admission, his coaching methods are pedagogic. As a\n\n                                35\n\fresult, he is acting as a proxy for the School District, and the\nSchool District may choose both how its students are taught and\nwhat its students are taught. Here, the School District adopted\nPachman’s guidelines because it determined that Borden’s\npedagogic methods were inappropriate. As evidenced by this\ncontinued litigation, the School District continues to find\nBorden’s pedagogic methods of teaching his players respect by\nengaging in his silent acts inappropriate. While Borden\ncertainly has the right to voice his disagreement with the School\nDistrict’s policy, in accord with our past precedent, he does not\nhave a right to act in contravention of the School District’s\npolicy based upon a right to academic freedom.14 For the above\nreasons, the District Court erred in holding that the guidelines\nand the Board’s statement violated Borden’s right to academic\nfreedom.\n\n       14\n         Borden alleges that a decision that he does not have the\nacademic freedom to engage in these acts amounts to controlling\nhis mind.       However, our precedent has consistently\ndemonstrated that it is the educational institution that has a right\nto academic freedom, not the individual teacher. See, e.g.,\nBrown v. Armenti, 247 F.3d 69, 75 (3d Cir. 2001). The teacher,\nin turn, has the right to speak on matters of public concern,\nincluding advocating certain pedagogic methods. See Edwards\nv. Cal. Univ. of Pa., 156 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(“[A]lthough [a teacher] has a right to advocate outside of the\nclassroom for the use of certain curriculum materials, he does\nnot have a right to use those materials in the classroom.”).\nHowever, the teacher cannot act in contravention of his or her\neducational institution’s in-class policies in the name of\nacademic freedom.\n\n                                36\n\f                  3. Freedom of Association\n\n       Borden’s complaint also alleged, and the District Court\nheld, that the School District’s guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement violated Borden’s right to freedom of association.\nSpecifically, he asserts that First Amendment jurisprudence\ndemonstrates that the policy infringes on his “right to associate\nwith his players by forcibly segregating [him], both physically\nand mentally, from his players while they engage in the\nimportant team act of saying pre-game prayers.” However, we\nfind this argument unavailing.\n\n        While the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution\nprotects certain relationships, those protected relationships\nrequire a closeness that is not present between a high school\nfootball coach and his team. The Court has not limited the\nprotection to familial relationships, but generally the protected\nrelationships include “marriage, the begetting and bearing of\nchildren, child rearing and education, and cohabitation with\nrelatives.” See Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club, 481\nU.S. 537, 545 (1987) (citations omitted); id. at 546-47 (not\nextending the protection to the Rotary Club). We do not doubt\nthat football coaches have a special relationship with the players\non their team. However, the relationship is typically not so\nclose as to involve “‘not only a special community of thoughts,\nexperiences, and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects\nof one’s life.’” Id. at 545 (quoting Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468\nU.S. 609, 619-20 (1984)). Therefore, we find that the guidelines\nprohibiting him from participating in the players’ prayer\nactivities do not interfere with his freedom of association rights,\n\n\n\n                                37\n\fparticularly because he is violating the Establishment Clause\nwhile doing so. See infra Part III.C.15\n\n                         4. Due Process\n\n       Borden also argues that the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement violated his rights to due process. In the context of\nschool district policies, we have previously stated that the same\n\n       15\n          While Borden’s argument is not entirely clear, he may\nalso be asserting an expressive association claim. To the extent\nthat Borden makes this argument, we deem it to fail. The\nfootball team must be an “expressive association” for it to fall\nwithin the ambit of the First Amendment’s protection. See Boy\nScouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000). To be an\n“expressive association,” the group does not need to be an\nadvocacy group, but it “must engage in some form of\nexpression, whether it be public or private.” Id. The Supreme\nCourt has held that the Boy Scouts engage in expressive\nassociation because the organization seeks to instill values in the\nyouth members. Id. at 649-50.\n         Borden argues that, as a football coach, he similarly\ninstills values in the members of his team. However, unlike the\nBoy Scouts in Dale, Borden is instilling values in the team as\npart of his duties as a public school employee and not as part of\na private association. As discussed in part III.C of this opinion,\nsee infra, the School District has the right to issue its guidelines,\nparticularly because it needed to prevent Borden from violating\nthe Establishment Clause. Therefore, we find any expressive\nassociation argument that Borden is attempting to make to be\ninvalid.\n\n                                 38\n\ftest for vagueness applies to a procedural due process claim.\nBradley, 910 F.2d at 1177. Thus, a rule prohibiting conduct\nmust not be “in terms so vague that people of common\nintelligence must guess as to its meaning . . . .” Id. As indicated\nby the discussion above, the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement were not unconstitutionally vague. See supra Part\nIII.A.2.\n\n       Therefore, Borden must point to a fundamental right that\nhe has which the policy infringed upon in order to establish a\ndue process violation. He can do no such thing. Borden tries to\ncite to federal case law regarding privacy rights, such as\nGriswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), to argue that the School District has\nintruded upon his privacy, thoughts, autonomy, desires and\nwishes. He claims that the School District’s requirement that he\nnot engage in taking a knee and bowing his head degraded him\nas a person and humiliated him in front of his team. However\nimpassioned Borden’s arguments may be, they lack any basis in\nthe law. Borden has no interest – privacy, liberty, or otherwise\n– in behavior that violates the Establishment Clause.16 For these\n\n       16\n         Borden attempts to argue that the New Jersey\nConstitution provides him greater due process protections than\nthe U.S. Constitution. Under the New Jersey Constitution,\nclaims involving fundamental rights are to be analyzed using a\nbalancing test, “consider[ing] the nature of the affected right, the\nextent to which the governmental restriction intrudes upon it,\nand the public need for the restriction.” Greenberg v.\nKimmelman, 494 A.2d 294, 302 (N.J. 1985). However, the\nbalancing here has the same result as under federal\n\n                                39\n\freasons, the guidelines and the Board’s statement did not\ninfringe on Borden’s due process rights.\n\n           C. The School District Had a Right to\n       Adopt the Guidelines Because It Was Concerned\n          About Establishment Clause Violations.\n\n        As discussed above, the School District’s guidelines and\nthe Board’s statement were not unconstitutional on their face\nand did not violate Borden’s constitutional rights. We have\npreviously held that, where an official at a public school does\nnot have a First Amendment right to his or her expression, the\nschool district’s policy does not need to be “reasonably related\nto a legitimate educational interest.” See Edwards, 156 F.3d at\n491. Thus, because Borden has no First Amendment right to his\nsilent acts, we do not need to analyze the policy under this\nstandard. However, even if we applied that standard to the\npresent case, we would arrive at the same result: the School\nDistrict had a right to adopt its policy.\n\n        The School District has a legitimate educational interest\nin avoiding Establishment Clause violations, and the guidelines\nare reasonably related to that interest. The Supreme Court has\nstated that “compliance with the Establishment Clause is a state\ninterest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based\nrestrictions on speech.” Pinette, 515 U.S. at 761-62; see also\n\n\nconstitutional principles because the public need – to prohibit\nEstablishment Clause violations, which as discussed below, are\npresent in this case – is so great. Therefore, Borden’s argument\nfails.\n\n                               40\n\fLocke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 730 n.2 (2004) (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting) (“[A] State has a compelling interest in not\ncommitting actual Establishment Clause violations.”). If\ncompliance with the Establishment Clause can rise to a\ncompelling state interest, surely it is a legitimate educational\ninterest. Moreover, the guidelines are related to that interest\nbecause, as discussed in the overbreadth and vagueness analysis,\nthe prohibited conduct would violate the Establishment Clause.\nIn fact, based on the history and context of Borden’s conduct in\ncoaching the EBHS football team over the past twenty-three\nyears, Borden is in violation of the Establishment Clause when\nhe bows his head and takes a knee while his team prays.17\n\n       17\n         The defendants suggest that we do not need to reach the\nissue of whether Borden’s requested actions, to bow his head\nand take a knee while his team prays, constitute an\nEstablishment Clause violation. Borden’s complaint did not\nmake any allegations regarding the Establishment Clause; the\nEstablishment Clause only surfaced in the cross-motions for\nsummary judgment to the District Court because the defendants\nthought that Borden was asserting a Free Exercise claim, which\nhe was not. However, in reaching its decision, the District Court\nfound “that the Plaintiff’s request to bow his head in silence and\ntake a knee do not violate the Establishment Clause of the\nConstitution.” This decision was a declaratory judgment\nbecause it “declare[d] the rights and other legal relations” of the\ninterested parties. 28 U.S.C. § 2201. The District Court was\nwithin its right to grant a declaratory judgment. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 57. But we must now review the district court’s decision, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2201, and in reviewing a decision to grant a\ndeclaratory judgment, “we will exercise plenary review over the\n\n                                41\n\f       Under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment,\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion.” U.S. Const. amend. I. This provision applies equally\nto the states, including public school systems, through the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38,\n49-50 (1985). The Supreme Court has set forth three tests for\ndetermining whether governmental action violates the\nEstablishment Clause: the coercion test, the Lemon test, and the\nendorsement test. Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 400-01. We do not\naddress whether Borden’s conduct violates the Establishment\nClause under the coercion18 and Lemon19 tests because we find\nthat Borden’s behavior violates the Establishment Clause under\nthe endorsement test.\n\n\n\ndistrict court’s conclusions of law.” Silverman v. Eastrich\nMultiple Investor Fund, L.P., 51 F.3d 28, 30 (3d Cir. 1995).\nTherefore, we find it necessary to reach the District Court’s\nconclusion of law.\n       18\n        The coercion test looks at whether the government is\n“coerc[ing] anyone to support or participate in religion or its\nexercise . . . .” Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 587 (1992).\n       19\n         The Lemon test, named after the Supreme Court case of\nLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), established a three-\nprong test, holding that conduct violates the Establishment\nClause “if (1) it lacks a secular purpose, (2) its primary effect\neither advances or inhibits religion, or (3) it fosters an excessive\nentanglement of government with religion.” Modrovich, 385\nF.3d at 401 (citing Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13).\n\n                                42\n\f        The endorsement test applies “[i]n cases involving state\nparticipation in a religious activity.” See Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at\n308. For example, in Santa Fe, the leading case on prayers\nbefore high school football games, the Supreme Court used the\nendorsement test in considering whether a school district\nviolated the Establishment Clause where its policy allowed a\nstudent to deliver a pre-game prayer based on a voting system.\nId. Here, Borden, an employee of the School District as both the\nhead football coach and a tenured teacher, would like to bow his\nhead and take a knee while students pray. Thus, the\nendorsement test is applicable here because these facts involve\na state employee engaging in the religious activity of students in\nsome fashion.\n\n       The relevant question under the endorsement test is\n“whether a reasonable observer familiar with the history and\ncontext of the display would perceive the display as a\ngovernment endorsement of religion.” Modrovich, 385 F.3d at\n401; see also Am. Civil Liberties Union Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter, 492 U.S. at 596 (adopting the endorsement test). The\ntest does not focus on the government’s subjective purpose\nwhen behaving in a particular manner, but instead focuses on the\nperceptions of the reasonable observer. Modrovich, 385 F.3d at\n401.\n\n       The history and context of Borden’s prayer activities with\nthe team, if challenged, could have been Establishment Clause\nviolations. In a case that is similar to the facts of the present\ncase prior to the School District’s enactment of the policy, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that a basketball\ncoach’s involvement in prayer “signal[ed] an unconstitutional\n\n                               43\n\fendorsement of religion.” Duncanville, 70 F.3d at 406. In\nDuncanville, a basketball coach recited the Lord’s Prayer with\nhis players during practices and after games. Id. at 404. Parents\nof the students challenged this practice, and the district court\ngranted an injunction which prohibited “[the school district], its\nemployees and its agents from: leading, encouraging,\npromoting, or participating in prayers with or among students\nduring curricular or extracurricular activities, including before,\nduring, or after school-related sporting events. . . . Students may\nvoluntarily pray together, provided such prayer is not done with\nschool participation or supervision.” Id. at 405-06. The school\ndistrict challenged the district court’s injunction, arguing that\nthis prohibition violated its employees’ rights to free exercise of\nreligion, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and\nacademic freedom. Id. at 406. The Fifth Circuit disagreed,\nstating that the government’s facilitation of the free exercise of\nreligion or free expression rights cannot “‘supersede the\nfundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause.’”\nId. (quoting Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 586-87 (1992)). In\naddition, the context of the challenged prayer activities, which\noccurred during “school-controlled” activities that the team must\nattend, demonstrated that the coaches’ “actions [were]\nrepresentative of [school district] policies.” Id. Thus, the Fifth\nCircuit upheld the District Court’s injunction, finding that the\ncoaches’ participation was “an unconstitutional endorsement of\nreligion.” Id.\n\n       Likewise, Borden’s past conduct “signals an\nunconstitutional endorsement of religion.” Id. For twenty-three\nyears, Borden led the team in a pre-game prayer in the locker\nroom. During that same period of time, Borden orchestrated a\n\n                                44\n\fpre-meal grace for his team. He originally had a chaplain\nconduct the pre-meal grace. This practice changed only after\nschool officials asked him to stop; then he had the chaplain write\nthe grace and he selected seniors on the team to recite it.\nAdditionally, during at least three seasons, Borden led the team\nin the first prayer of the season. Both of these activities, the\nlocker room preparations and the pre-game meals, were school-\nsponsored events. As in Duncanville, Borden’s involvement in\nprayer at these two activities – as a participant, an organizer, and\na leader – would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that he\nwas endorsing religion.\n\n        In analyzing Borden’s request to engage in silent acts\nwith his teams, we must consider all of his prior prayer activities\nwith his team as the Supreme Court did in Santa Fe. For many\nyears, the Santa Fe Independent School District began each high\nschool football game with a prayer led by the “Student\nChaplain.” Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 294, 309. After realizing that\nsuch conduct would violate the Establishment Clause, the school\ndistrict developed a two-step student election process, which\nallowed students to (1) first decide whether an invocation would\nbe given at the beginning of a game; and (2) then elect the\nspeaker to give the invocation. Id. at 306. The Supreme Court\nconsidered the many years of pre-game prayers at the school,\nand the evolution of the policy, including the name “Prayer at\nFootball Games” and its stated purpose, which is to\n“solemniz[e]” the occasion. Id. at 308-09. It found that “an\nobjective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably\nperceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her\nschool’s seal of approval.” Id. at 308. Moreover, it stated that\nall of these factors indicated that the purpose of the policy was\n\n                                45\n\fto preserve the popular pre-game prayer, regardless of the\nschool district’s stated purposes. Id. at 309. Thus, it found that\nthe policy failed the endorsement test and violated the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 308-10.\n\n        Similarly to Santa Fe and as discussed above, the current\ncontroversy is built upon a significant history of pre-game\nprayers that involved Borden. Borden organized prayers for the\npre-meal grace at the team dinner; he had a chaplain say a\nprayer and then selected seniors to say the prayer. But even\nmore importantly, Borden led prayers himself – on at least three\noccasions for the pre-meal grace, and before each game for\ntwenty-three years for the locker room prayer. Additionally,\nwhen EBHS officials asked Borden to discontinue this conduct,\nhe initially resigned from his position as coach of the team\nrather than continue as coach without engaging in the prayer\nactivities. This history of Borden’s prayers with the football\nteam leads to a reasonable inference that his current requested\nconduct is meant “to preserve a popular ‘state-sponsored\nreligious practice’” of praying with his team prior to games.\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 309 (citing Lee, 505 U.S. at 596).\n\n      Borden has stated that his intention in taking a knee and\nbowing during prayer is to show signs of respect to his team, not\nendorse religion.20 Borden attempts to support this argument by\n\n       20\n         As an employee of the School District as both a coach\nand tenured teacher, Borden’s actions can be imputed to the\nSchool District. For this reason, Borden’s claim that the School\nDistrict could remove any Establishment Clause violation by\nwriting a disclaimer saying that Borden’s speech does not\n\n                               46\n\fpointing to language in Duncanville, which states that “neither\nthe Establishment Clause nor the district court’s order prevent\n[school district] employees from treating students’ religious\nbeliefs and practices with deference and respect; indeed, the\nconstitution requires this. Nothing compels [school district]\nemployees to make their non-participation vehemently obvious\nor to leave the room when students pray . . . .” Duncanville, 70\nF.3d at 406 n.4.21\n\n\nrepresent the ideals of the School District is simply wrong.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has previously suggested\ndisclaimers as a way to demonstrate that a school district is not\nendorsing religion, see Bd. of Educ. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,\n251 (1990), that was only applicable in the context of permitting\nstudent clubs of a religious nature to meet on school grounds.\nThe Court reasoned that “there is little if any risk of official state\nendorsement or coercion where no formal classroom activities\nare involved and no school officials actively participate.” Id.\nThe circumstances are different where, as here, a school official\ncould reasonably be perceived as engaging in the students’\nprayer activities. Therefore, a disclaimer by the School District\nwould not remove the Establishment Clause violation.\n       21\n         Borden also invokes the football greats, like Bear\nBryant, to indicate that taking a knee is merely a gesture in the\nland of football. However, although taking a knee in a huddle\nto discuss strategy is a gesture well known to football gurus as\nbeing part of the game, Borden said a prayer while taking a knee\nwith his team for over twenty-three years. Based on this\nundisputed history, a reasonable EBHS player would conclude\nthat Borden is endorsing religion if he continues to take a knee\n\n                                 47\n\f        However, we find Borden’s argument to be unavailing.\nFirst, the inquiry is not whether Borden intends to endorse\nreligion, but whether a reasonable observer, with knowledge of\nthe history and context of the display, would conclude that he is\nendorsing religion. See Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 401.\nAdditionally, Borden fails to note that the Fifth Circuit does not\npermit any respectful display to pass muster in evaluating the\nconstitutionality of the display. See Duncanville, 70 F.3d at 406\nn.4. Instead, the Fifth Circuit, in the sentence immediately\nfollowing the above quote, stated that, “if while acting in their\nofficial capacities, [school district] employees join hands in a\nprayer circle or otherwise manifest approval and solidarity with\nstudent religious exercises, they cross the line between respect\nfor religion and endorsement of religion.” Id. Thus, Borden’s\nreliance on Duncanville is only partially accurate because the\nrespectful display is permissible only if it does not “cross the\nline” and endorse religion.\n\n       We find that, based on the history of Borden’s conduct\nwith the team’s prayers, his acts cross the line and constitute an\nunconstitutional endorsement of religion. Although Borden\nbelieves that he must continue to engage in these actions to\ndemonstrate solidarity with his team, which is perhaps good for\na football team’s unity, we must consider whether a reasonable\nobserver would perceive his actions as endorsing religion, not\nwhether Borden intends to endorse religion. A reasonable\nobserver would have knowledge of Borden’s extensive\ninvolvement with the team’s prayers over the past twenty-three\nyears during which he organized, participated in, and led\n\n\nwhile his team prays.\n\n                               48\n\fprayer.22 Based on this history, we hold that a reasonable\nobserver would conclude that Borden is showing not merely\nrespect when he bows his head and takes a knee with his teams\nand is instead endorsing religion.23\n\n       22\n          Borden argues that the reasonable observer would also\nbe familiar with the School District’s previous treatment of\nreligion. He references Pope v. East Brunswick Board of\nEducation, 12 F.3d 1244, 1254 (3d Cir. 1993), a case in which\nthe School District was admonished for searching the Equal\nAccess Act for loopholes that would allow it to deny a religious\nclub access to the school after hours. Borden argues that this\ncase shows the School District’s disdain for religion, and as a\nresult, the reasonable observer would not consider his actions to\nbe religious. However, even if the observer knew of the School\nDistrict’s former problems with religious organizations, the\nobserver would also know that for at least ten years following\nthe Pope case, Borden, a school official, was involved in prayer\nactivities at the team dinner, and even more importantly, led a\nteam prayer before each game. With this knowledge, the\nreasonable observer would view Borden’s conduct as endorsing\nreligion despite any conflicts with religious organizations that\nthe School District had fifteen years ago.\n       23\n         As additional evidence of an Establishment Clause\nviolation, the defendants argue that the pre-game prayers were\nnot truly student initiated. They suggest that by sending the\nemail to the team captains asking them to poll the team about the\nprayers and then asking for the results, Borden himself initiated\nthe prayers. The defendants’ argument is supported by the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 317, which\n\n                               49\n\f       Without Borden’s twenty-three years of organizing,\nparticipating in, and leading prayer with his team, this\nconclusion would not be so clear as it presently is. We agree\nwith Borden that bowing one’s head and taking a knee can be\nsigns of respect.24 Thus, if a football coach, who had never\nengaged in prayer with his team, were to bow his head and take\na knee while his team engaged in a moment of reflection or\nprayer, we would likely reach a different conclusion because the\nsame history and context of endorsing religion would not be\npresent.25 However, in Borden’s case, the conclusion we reach\n\n\nfound that a school district violated the Establishment Clause\nwhen it sponsored a student vote on student-led prayer.\nHowever, we need not make this determination because even if\nthe pre-game prayers were truly student initiated, Borden’s\nparticipation in them by bowing his head and taking a knee\nviolate the Establishment Clause for the reasons discussed.\n       24\n          Judge Barry agrees with this statement. See Con. Op.\nat 70 (Barry, J., concurring) (labeling Borden’s actions as\n“silent, unobtrusive sign[s] of respect”).\n       25\n         In his concurring opinion, Judge McKee points to a\npicture of Borden with his team. See Con. Op. at 55-57\n(McKee, J., concurring). In doing so, he suggests that a\nreasonable observer could “conclude that the coach is praying\nwith his team - perhaps even that he is leading the team in\nprayer,” id., even if there was no history of the coach praying\nwith his team. We cannot agree with this conclusion because\nthis photograph, standing alone, would be insufficient to satisfy\nthe “fact-specific, case-by-case” inquiry required. Id. at 2\n\n                               50\n\ftoday is clear because he organized, participated in, and led\nprayer activities with his team on numerous occasions for\ntwenty-three years. Thus, a reasonable observer would conclude\nthat he is continuing to endorse religion when he bows his head\nduring the pre-meal grace and takes a knee with his team in the\nlocker room while they pray.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement were not unconstitutional\non their face, were not unconstitutional as applied to Borden,\nand in fact, were necessary for the School District in order to\navoid Establishment Clause violations. Therefore, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n(quoting Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 402). For a court to complete\nthe required analysis, it would need to consider additional facts,\nincluding, for example: (1) Is the team engaging in a moment\nof silence, or is someone speaking? (2) If a person is speaking,\nis he saying a prayer? (3) If it is a prayer, is it a player or the\ncoach reciting the prayer? and (4) Who decided to say the\nprayer? Only after knowing these facts, as well as the coach’s\nhistory of prayer activities with his team, could any court make\nthe determination required under the endorsement test.\n\n                                51\n\fMcKEE, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n        I join Judge Fisher’s lead opinion, but write separately to\nclarify a few points, and express a few concerns. At the outset,\nI emphasize that we today hold only that (i) the School District’s\npolicy is not overbroad and vague; (ii) the policy did not violate\nBorden’s constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of\nassociation, academic freedom, or due process; and (iii) under\nthe circumstances here, Borden’s practice of bowing his head\nand “taking a knee” as his team prays violates the Establishment\nClause.26\n\n       However, I do not join my colleagues’ suggestion that we\nmight reach a different result here absent Borden’s 23-year\nhistory of promoting team prayer. That question is not before\nus, and I believe that Borden’s “respectful display,” see Con.\nOp., infra, at 69 (Barry, J., concurring), might well violate the\nEstablishment Clause even absent his 23-year history.\nSimilarly, I can not agree that the football team’s pregame ritual\ncan accurately be characterized as “student-initiated” prayer.\n\n                                I.\n\n       In reaching our holding, the lead opinion suggests: “[I]f\na football coach, who had never engaged in prayer with his\nteam, were to bow his head and take a knee while his team\nengaged in a moment of reflection or prayer, we would likely\n\n       26\n        Both of my colleagues, as well as the district court and\nthe parties, refer to Borden’s conduct as “taking a knee.”\nAccordingly, I will also use that phrase.\n\n                                52\n\freach a different conclusion . . . .” Supra, at 52; see also Con.\nOp., infra, at 71 (Barry, J., concurring). I am not as sure.\nAlthough I agree that would be a more difficult case, it is not\nclear to me that our Establishment Clause inquiry would yield\na different result. “[E]very Establishment Clause challenge\nrequires a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis.” Modrovich v.\nAllegheny County, 385 F.3d 397, 402 (3d Cir. 2004). As\ndiscussed in the lead opinion, our Establishment Clause inquiry\nhere turns on whether an objective observer would interpret\nBorden’s proposed actions as a state endorsement of religion.\nSupra, at 38. I believe such an observer could interpret\nBorden’s proposed actions as an endorsement of religion even\nabsent the coach’s history of promoting team prayer.\n\n          Coach Borden’s suit against the School District did not\nseek a declaration “permitting him to pray with his players,”\nBorden’s Br. at 9, but rather “a declaration that he be allowed\n. . . to continue to demonstrate respect for his players by silently\nbowing his head and taking a knee during The Team Prayers.”\nCompl. ¶ 18. However, as Judge Fisher’s lead opinion explains,\nit is not Coach Borden’s subjective intent that controls whether\nhis conduct runs afoul of the Establishment Clause. Rather, the\nquestion at the heart of the endorsement test, is whether an\nobjective observer would perceive that Borden, and by extension\nthe School District and therefore the state, is advancing or\npromoting religious practice. Here, if Coach Borden silently\nbows his head and takes a knee as he requests, even without\nknowledge of Borden’s 23-year history of involvement with pre-\ngame prayer, any such observer who peered into East\n\n\n\n\n                                53\n\fBrunswick’s locker room before a game would probably\nobserve something very much like the following:27\n\n\n\n\n       27\n          In fairness, it is important to note that when asked at\noral argument, counsel for Coach Borden was not able to\nconfirm that this picture, submitted in the School District’s\nReply Brief, accurately depicts the pregame prayers after the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment. The photograph\nwas not entered into evidence in the district court. However, it\nis not disputed that the coach in the picture is Coach Borden,\nand counsel for Borden did not claim that the picture is\ninaccurate. Regardless of when it was taken, it certainly appears\nto be what an objective observer would see if he/she were to\nobserve the coach “silently bowing his head and taking a knee.”\nCompl. ¶ 18. In his brief to this court, Borden states that after\nthe district court invalidated the School District’s policy, he\n“silently bowed his head and took a knee with his players while\nhis players prayed before every game during the 2006 season.”\nBorden’s Br. at 3. (This photograph was downloaded from the\nBoston Globe web site, and is available at\nhttp://www.boston.com/sports/schools/gallery/\n11_07_06_grossfeld_prayer/) (last viewed March 12, 2008).\n\n                               54\n\f        It would be neither surprising nor unreasonable if that\nobserver were to conclude that the coach is praying with his\nteam - perhaps even that he is leading the team in prayer. Such\na conclusion would certainly be buttressed by knowledge of\nCoach Borden’s history of involvement in team prayer, but the\nabsence of that history would not necessarily yield a different\nresult.\n\n\n\n\n                              55\n\f                               II.\n\n        Another troubling consideration (which I amplify below)\nis that a non-religious student or one who adheres to a minority\nreligion might feel subtle (albeit unintentional) coercion to\nparticipate in the ritual despite disagreement or discomfort with\nit. That raises a serious Establishment Clause issue under the\nSupreme Court’s “coercion” test.28\n\n        The district court accepted the argument that the prayer\nthat occurred after October 7, 2005, was “student-initiated.” (JA\n37). It clearly was not. I have no doubt that Coach Borden is a\nsincere and remarkably dedicated individual who cares deeply\nfor his players. He is also a very successful coach.\nUnfortunately, in an apparent desire to do what he thought was\n\n       28\n         The Supreme Court has applied the “coercion” test as\nwell as the “endorsement” test in determining whether state\naction violates the Establishment Clause in the public school\ncontext. See Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290\n(2000) (applying endorsement test and coercion test); Lee v.\nWeisman, 505 U.S. 577, 592 (1992) (observing that “there are\nheightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience\nfrom subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary\npublic schools” because “prayer exercises in public schools\ncarry a particular risk of indirect coercion”); Grand Rapids Sch.\nDist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 390 (1985) (“The symbolism of a\nunion between church and state is most likely to influence\nchildren of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose\nbeliefs consequently are the function of environment as much as\nof free and voluntary choice.”).\n\n                               56\n\fbest for his players, he lost sight of his role as a teacher in a\npublic school.\n\n       After initiating this litigation, and prior to the start of the\n2006 season, Coach Borden directed the captains to poll the\nfootball team and ask each player whether or not he wanted to\n“follow the same practices as last year” regarding prayer at the\npregame meals and in the locker room before the games. (JA\n497). The captains then personally phoned every member of the\nfootball team. Not surprisingly, given the non-anonymous\nnature of the poll, no player objected. Given the uproar this\nissue visited on the community, the players must have known\nhow important prayer was to their coach - and no high school\nathlete would want to disappoint the coach, or (as I shall\nexplain) risk incurring the communal wrath that had been visited\non the unfortunate cheerleaders the year before.29\n\n       I am not suggesting that Coach Borden intentionally\npressured his players into voting for pregame prayer ceremonies\nor that he wanted to manipulate the outcome. Nevertheless,\nthese players were put in the untenable position of either\ncompromising any opposing beliefs they may have had or going\n\n       29\n         Moreover, the Supreme Court has held on more than\none occasion that “fundamental rights may not be submitted to\nvote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” West\nVirginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943),\nquoted in Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 304-5. “The whole theory of\nviewpoint neutrality is that minority views are treated with the\nsame respect as are majority views.” Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 304-\n05 (citation omitted).\n\n                                 57\n\fon record (at the very least with their captains) as opposing their\ncoach and perhaps a majority of their teammates.\n\n       Although the coach thought that the prayers would foster\nteam unity, and even though the captains reported that all\nplayers wanted to continue the tradition, the record suggests that\nthe reality was quite different.        In the fall of 2005,\nSuperintendent Magistro received a phone call from a “crying\nand overwrought” woman who identified herself as the mother\nof an East Brunswick football player. (JA 153-59, 451). The\nmother complained that her son “was extremely upset at Mr.\nBorden’s fostering and participating in prayer amongst the\nfootball players.” (Id. at 451). When Magistro asked why her\nson participated in the team prayers despite his discomfort, the\nmother responded that he “was fearful that if he did not go along\nwith what was obviously the coach’s desire, he would not get\nplaying time.” (Id.). The call was one of the factors that led to\nthe School District policy Borden challenges.\n\n       Unfortunately, the coach appears not to have considered\nthe possibility that the tradition he wanted to foster could be\ntroubling for some players and possibly deter others from\nplaying football at all. The Supreme Court addressed an\nanalogous situation in Lee. There, the Court held that a public\nschool could not force nonbelievers to choose between\nparticipating in prayer or missing their graduation ceremony.\n\n       Attendance [at graduation] may not be required\n       by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student\n       is not free to absent herself from the graduation\n       exercise in any real sense of the term “voluntary,”\n\n                                58\n\f       for absence would require forfeiture of those\n       intangible benefits which would have motivated\n       the student through youth and all her high school\n       years.\n\nLee, 505 U.S. at 595. Participation in high school athletics is no\nless important than attending one’s high school graduation.\nIndeed, the ongoing involvement with high school athletics is\nundoubtedly far more important to some than a one-time\ngraduation ceremony. High school sports have long been a\ncentral part of our communities and they shape the character of\nmany teenagers far more than a single graduation ceremony.\n\n        Regrettably, Coach Borden as a teacher (and therefore as\na state actor for purposes of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments) failed to appreciate that others may not agree with\nhis beliefs or that the religious beliefs that he held dear might be\nin tension with contrary (but equally valid) beliefs of some of\nhis players. Any player who held opposing beliefs should not\nhave had to “go along to get along” by silently participating in\nreligious observances he disagreed with.\n\n       For, “the government may no more use social\n       pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use\n       more direct means.” . . . “[W]hat to most believers\n       may seem nothing more than a reasonable request\n       that the nonbeliever respect their religious\n       practices, in a school context may appear to the\n       nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to\n       employ the machinery of the State to enforce a\n       religious orthodoxy.” . . . The constitutional\n\n                                59\n\f       command will not permit the District “to exact\n       religious conformity from a student as the price”\n       of joining [his] classmates at a varsity football\n       game.\n\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 312 (quoting Lee, 505 U.S. at 592, 594).\n\n       Indeed, “it is quite possible that parents of some\n[students] chose public education precisely so that their children\nwould not be compelled to follow the religious beliefs of\nothers.” ACLU v. Black Horse Pike Regional Bd. of Educ., 84\nF.3d 1471, 1482 (3d Cir. 1996)(en banc). That likelihood is\nparticularly strong here given the telephone call of at least one\n“overwrought” parent that Superintendent Magistro received in\nreaction to pregame prayers before the School District enacted\nthe policy that is challenged here.\n\n       This does not, of course, mean that students have no right\nto pray; they clearly do. Whatever else it may be, prayer is a\nform of speech and deserves no less protection than secular\nspeech. Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 424-25 (1962).30 The\npolicy the School District developed in response to the\ncomplaints about pregame prayers was an effort to protect the\nFirst Amendment liberties of everyone in the school community.\n\n                               III.\n\n\n\n\n       30\n         Such prayer does not, however, have to occur in the\nlocker room.\n\n                               60\n\f       The Supreme Court has observed that “[w]e are a\nreligious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme\nBeing.” Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313 (1952). Yet, the\nCourt also reminds us that “[i]t is neither sacrilegious nor anti-\nreligious to say that each separate government in this country\nshould stay out of the business of [religion] . . . and leave . . .\npurely religious function[s] to the people themselves and to\nthose the people choose to look to for religious guidance.”\nEngel, 370 U.S. at 435.\n\n       Coach Borden’s dedication to instilling in his players\nvalues such as respect and team unity is certainly praiseworthy.\nHowever, as we have explained, the laudable intentions of state\nactors do not control an analysis under the First Amendment.\n“For just as religion throughout history has provided spiritual\ncomfort, guidance, and inspiration to many, it can also serve\npowerfully to divide societies and to exclude those whose\nbeliefs are not in accord with particular religions or sects that\nhave from time to time achieved dominance.” Grand Rapids\nSch. Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 382 (1985). This record\ncontains powerful evidence of such division.\n\n        Superintendent Magistro testified that she received\ntelephone calls in September 2005 from some parents of\ncheerleaders. They complained that their daughters were\n“uncomfortable” when Borden initiated a prayer at a pregame\ndinner. (JA 153-56). Students apparently learned of these\ncomplaints, and blamed two Jewish cheerleaders. Thereafter,\nthose cheerleaders were publicly ridiculed by other students at\nathletic events, and the cheerleading squad was taunted, bullied,\nand booed. (JA 452 at ¶ 5). The cheerleaders were even\n\n                                61\n\fharassed and threatened on a student internet “blog.” In the\ndays following Coach Borden’s resignation, several internet\nposts appeared under the heading, “Jewish Cheerleaders who\nsuck!!!.” The following are a few examples of the disgusting\ncomments that were posted:\n\n      •      “First they crucify Jesus, then they got\n             Borden fired . . . . Jews gotta learn to stop\n             ruining everything cool.” (JA 460)\n\n      •      “The jew is wrong. Borden is right. Let\n             us pray.” (JA 467)\n\n      •      “d**n jews . . . then you wonder why\n             hitler did what he did back in the day.” (JA\n             471)\n\n      •      “MAYBE if [Borden] held a gun to the\n             jjjjewwws head and was like b*tch get on\n             ur knees and pray to jesus!! then that\n             might be breaking the law...ehhh maybe\n             not! . . . just suck it up if u don’t fu*king\n             like whats going on in america then GO\n             THE FU*K BACK TO YOUR\n             COUNTRY AND STAY THERE AND\n             PRAY . . . .” (JA 487-88)\n\n      •      “Heil Hitla!!! sieg heill.” (JA 490)31\n\n      31\n       Borden’s counsel, in his brief and at oral argument,\nurged us to disregard evidence of parents’ calls to the\n\n                              62\n\fSuperintendent and harassment of the cheerleaders:\n\n      [E]very assertion cited to by [the School District]\n      to support every alleged parent or student\n      complaint about Borden’s pre-October 7, 2005[,]\n      activity is based on hearsay that is derived from\n      anonymous sources that the [School] District\n      refused to identify.       Defendants have not\n      submitted a single sworn, or even unsworn,\n      statement from any alleged complaining student\n      or parent. Nor has the [School] District disclosed\n      the name of any alleged complaining student or\n      parent.\n\nBorden’s Br. at 16-17. However, given the nature of these\nvenomous comments, counsel can not seriously suggest that the\nevidence be ignored merely because students and parents who\nopposed Coach Borden’s policy were not willing to identify\nthemselves and offer direct testimony. The situation is neither\nnew nor unique. In Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe,\nthe Court noted that the district court permitted students and\nparents to litigate anonymously. 530 U.S. at 294. The\nopprobrium that can await those who publicly state their\nopposition to prayer in school is evident from the Court’s\nopinion in Santa Fe:\n\n      About a month after the complaint was filed, the\n      District Court entered an order that provided in\n      part: “[A]ny further attempt on the part of District\n      or school administration, . . . teachers, employees\n\n                              63\n\f       These exchanges illustrate the continuing relevance of\nJustice O’Connor’s admonition that “[e]ndorsement sends a\nmessage to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full\nmembers of the political community, and an accompanying\nmessage to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of\nthe political community.” Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688\n(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring). The School District\nattempted to address these concerns by adopting the policy that\nthe district court struck down in the face of Coach Borden’s\nchallenge. In reversing the district court, we help to ensure the\ncontinued vitality of the Establishment Clause as well as the\nrights of all to worship as they please.\n\n\n\n\n       or servants of the School District, parents,\n       students or anyone else, . . . to ferret out the\n       identities of the Plaintiffs in this cause, by means\n       of bogus petitions, questionnaires, individual\n       interrogation, or downright ‘snooping’, will cease\n       immediately.\n\nId. at 294 n.1 (alteration in original). The district court had to\nthreaten contempt sanctions and criminal liability to protect\nthe parents and students who objected to the practice of prayer\nat football games. Id.\n\n                               64\n\fBARRY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n        There was no question, and the parties clearly\nunderstood, that there was one predominant issue before the\nDistrict Court: whether the actions in which Borden wished to\nengage would violate the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment, not whether the conduct in which he had engaged\nwould pass constitutional muster. Put in specific terms, the\nparties and the District Court focused their attention on how this\npublic high school football coach could react, consistent with\nthe Establishment Clause, when members of his team decide to\ninitiate voluntary prayers at a pre-game meal attended only by\nplayers, staff, players’ parents, and invited guests, and in the\nlocker room before a game where only players and coaches are\npresent.\n\n        Borden, for his part, represented that, whatever had gone\nbefore, he would no longer pray with the team, move his lips,\njoin his hands with the players, or even close his eyes. Rather,\nthe two silent actions in which he wished to engage – bowing\nhis head and taking a knee when the team decides to pray – are\nto show his “personal respect” for his players and “respect for\nwhat this game entails and what they do to go out there and play\nand give it their all.” The defendants had no problem with that.\nAs Superintendent Magistro put it, “if the courts determine that\n[Borden] taking a knee, bowing his head, is appropriate, that’s\nfine. He can do that. I think that’s what this is all about.”\nAgain, “[i]f the courts come down and say Borden can bow his\nhead, bend his knee, jump on the table, I am going to allow it.”\nThe defendants’ briefs before the District Court on the cross-\nmotions for summary judgment continued that theme. One put\n\n                               65\n\fit this way: “If this Court were to find plaintiff’s actions do not\nimplicate the Establishment Clause, then regardless of what\nConstitutional right plaintiff seeks relief under . . . he would be\nentitled to participate in voluntary, non-disruptive student\nprayers.”\n\n        Suffice it to say that when they were before the District\nCourt, the parties were in good faith trying to avoid an\nEstablishment Clause problem, with defendants explicitly\nagreeing to abide by the District Court’s decision. But\ndefendants did not do so. Rather, now armed with new counsel,\nthey filed an appeal, creating before us a legal landscape that\nbears little or no resemblance to what went on before the District\nCourt and surely causing the temperature of this litigation to\nsoar.\n\n       Given my druthers, I would hold defendants to their word\nand would not entertain, as my distinguished colleagues have so\ngenerously entertained, the new issues and arguments raised on\nthis appeal.32 I will not, however, tarry to push the proverbial\nwaiver rock uphill as to all of those issues and arguments\nbecause I cannot disagree, nor does Judge McKee, with the\nbottom-line conclusions of Judge Fisher’s superb lead opinion\nthat “the guidelines and the Board’s statement were not\nunconstitutional on their face, were not unconstitutional as\n\n       32\n         I would find, for example, that defendants have waived\nthe argument that numerous pedagogical reasons justified the\ndirectives and not just fear of litigation and the argument that\nBorden has no constitutional rights which would limit\ndefendants’ exercise of their discretion.\n\n                                66\n\fapplied to Borden, and in fact, were necessary for the School\nDistrict in order to avoid Establishment Clause violations.”\nThese conclusions are “threshold question[s] necessary to a\nproper analysis of the parties’ [Establishment Clause]\narguments,” before us and so, even if not adequately raised\nbefore the District Court, it is appropriate that we consider them.\nSee Tenafly Eruv Ass’n Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d\n144, 158 n.15 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n        I write separately, however, to express my view that\nwhether or not Borden’s past prayer activities with the team\nsignaled an unconstitutional endorsement of religion – and I\nhave little doubt that they did – a reasonable observer would not\nconclude that the “respectful display” he proposes would violate\nthe Establishment Clause. The lead opinion concludes, in its\nadditional, albeit unnecessary, “hold[ing],” that that display\nwould “cross the line.” It does so, however, as does Judge\nMcKee’s concurring opinion, by having the reasonable observer\nlook only at Borden’s twenty-three years of history with the\nteam’s prayers and the context of the display he proposes.33 Yet\na reasonable observer would not only have knowledge of that\nhistory, but would know of all that has taken place leading up to\n\n       33\n         Judge McKee has included in his concurring opinion a\npicture of unknown date that is not in evidence in this case and\nthus, in my view, not appropriately considered by us. Having\nlost that battle, I agree with Judge Fisher’s assessment of the\npicture and what more would be needed before a reasonable\nobserver could reach the conclusion that Borden was, in fact,\npraying, a conclusion reached by Judge McKee based on the\npicture alone. See Lead Op. at n.25.\n\n                                67\n\fand during this litigation and know that Borden, under oath, has\nrepresented what he will and will not do and that he merely\nwishes to show respect for his players when they pray. A\nreasonable observer would have no reason to believe that\nBorden was lying.\n\n        Moreover, given the limited number of attendees at the\npre-game meal, it is fair to say that a reasonable observer of a\nprayer before that event would be a player, coach, parent, or\ninvited guest, and a reasonable observer when the team takes a\nknee for a pre-game prayer in the locker room would be a player\nor a coach, just as in Santa Fe the observer was “an objective\nSanta Fe High School student.” Santa Fe Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Doe,\n530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000). Thus, if and when in the future a\nplayer decides to initiate prayer, the reasonable observer would\nknow, given Borden’s representations, that he did not ask for a\nprayer; did not select someone to say a prayer; did not monitor\nthe content of the prayer; did not provide a means for\nbroadcasting the prayer; did not join his hands with anyone; and\ndid not mouth the words of the prayer, or say it aloud, or\notherwise do anything to put the imprint of the state on the\nprayer. A reasonable observer would simply see Borden bow\nhis head or take a knee in a silent, unobtrusive sign of respect\nfor the private choices made by individual players who are\nconstitutionally permitted to choose to engage in religious\nactivities. See, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639,\n649-55 (2002); Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v.\nMergens, 496 U.S. 226, 251-52 (1990); Child Evangelism\nFellowship of N.J. Inc. v. Stafford Twp. Sch. Dist., 386 F.3d\n514, 531 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n                              68\n\f       My colleagues and I do not disagree that bowing one’s\nhead and taking a knee can be signs of respect; indeed, Judge\nFisher “would likely” find, as would I, no endorsement of\nreligion were a football coach, who had never engaged in prayer\nwith his team, to bow his head or take a knee while his team\nengaged in a moment of reflection or prayer. Apparently, it is\nonly Borden, given his prior history, who cannot constitutionally\nrespond to constitutionally protected student-initiated and\nstudent-composed prayer but, if he can, we are not told what\nresponse might be permissible. Surely he would not be required\nto keep his head erect or turn his back or stand and walk away.34\nAny such requirement would evidence a hostility to religion that\nno one would intend.\n\n       This is a difficult and close case, complicated by the fact\nthat, unlike the vast majority of Establishment Clause cases\nwhich are brought by plaintiffs complaining of a state’s actions,\nthis case was brought by an employee of a state complaining\nabout pre-emptive action taken by the state in its attempt to\navoid an Establishment Clause problem. With this litigation\nhopefully nearing its end, one also hopes that those involved\n\n\n       34\n         One wonders how a court can dictate, beyond a certain\npoint, what response is permissible, much less how a response\nwould be enforced. Defendants told the District Court that\nBorden can bow his head, but he cannot do “a pronounced\nbowing of the head.” What is “pronounced,” and who would\ndecide that question? As defendants also told the District Court,\n“The district does not have thought police, and we certainly\ndon’t have bow police.”\n\n                               69\n\fwill move forward as a team for the benefit of the young people\nwho look to them for guidance and support.\n\n\n\n\n                              70\n\f",

He brought\nsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the East Brunswick\nSchool District’s policy prohibiting faculty participation in\nstudent-initiated prayer was unconstitutionally overbroad and\nvague, and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to\n\n                                4\n\ffreedom of speech, academic freedom, freedom of association,\nand due process. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey declared the policy\nunconstitutional on all grounds, and it additionally held that\nBorden’s silent acts would not violate the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment. However, we hold that the policy is\nnot unconstitutional on its face or as applied to Borden.\nAdditionally, we hold that Borden’s silent acts violate the\nEstablishment Clause because, when viewing the acts in light of\nBorden’s twenty-three years of prior prayer activities with the\nEast Brunswick High School football team during which he\norganized, participated in, and even led prayer activities with his\nteam, a reasonable observer would conclude that Borden was\nendorsing religion when he engaged in these acts. Therefore,\nand for the reasons set forth in further detail below, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order.\n\n                                I.\n\n                       A. Factual History\n\n                 1. 1983-2005 (Pre-litigation)\n\n       Marcus Borden is the head football coach at East\nBrunswick High School (“EBHS”), and he has held that position\nsince 1983.1 During his tenure at EBHS, Borden engaged in two\npre-game prayer activities that occurred (1) at the team dinner;\nand (2) while taking a knee in the locker room.\n\n\n       1\n        Borden is also a tenured teacher of Spanish at EBHS.\n\n                                5\n\f        As part of the pre-game activities for the EBHS football\nteam, the team ate a pasta dinner together at approximately\n3:00 p.m. on game day in the high school cafeteria. In addition\nto the team, parents and other guests, including the cheerleading\nsquad, were present. Prior to the time Borden coached the team\nto 1997, a local minister, Reverend Smith, said a pre-meal\nprayer. However, in 1997, the athletic director told Borden that\nReverend Smith could not continue to say the prayer. Instead,\nReverend Smith wrote a prayer that the students took turns\nreading. Then, in 2003, Reverend Smith retired, and Borden did\nnot continue to have the students read Reverend Smith’s prayer.\nBorden instead began a new tradition: he said the prayer prior to\nthe first pre-game dinner of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 seasons.\nFor the subsequent weeks of those seasons, Borden asked those\nattending the dinner to “please stand,” and chose a senior player\nto say a prayer.\n\n        In addition to the prayer before the team dinner, Borden\nled his team in a prayer immediately before the game. Prior to\ntaking the field, Borden and his assistant coaches asked the\nplayers to take a knee in the locker room. The team gathered in\nfront of the chalkboard or dry erase board on one knee, and at\nthat time, Borden discussed the tactics and strategy for that\nparticular game. Following that discussion, Borden led the team\nin a prayer. Borden described an example of the prayer he said\nas follows:\n\n       “[D]ear lord, please guide us today in our quest in\n       our game, our championship. Give us the courage\n       and determination that we would need to come\n       out successful. Please let us represent our\n\n                               6\n\f       families and our community well. Lastly, please\n       guide our players and opponents so that they can\n       come out of this game unscathed, [and] no one is\n       hurt.”\n\nThe team participated in this tradition for twenty-three seasons,\nbeginning when Borden became the coach of the EBHS football\nteam in 1983 and continuing until the 2005 football season.\n\n        On September 26, 2005, Jo Ann Magistro, the\nSuperintendent of the East Brunswick School District (“School\nDistrict”), received a complaint from a parent about the prayer\nat the team dinner. The parent told Magistro that she thought it\nwas inappropriate that Borden requested that everyone stand for\nthe prayer and that he bowed his head during the prayer. Over\nthe course of that week, two other parents complained to\nMagistro about the prayer. One of the complaining parents had\na son on the team, and the parent told Magistro that her son felt\nuncomfortable during the prayer and feared that the coach would\nselect him to say the prayer.\n\n        Although Magistro did not contact Borden herself, the\nEBHS principal and athletic director contacted Borden about\nthese complaints. They told him not to lead the team in prayer,\nand he responded that he did not lead them in prayer. At the\nteam dinner on September 30, 2005, he continued the prayer\ntraditions in the manner described above. It was alleged that he\ntold the students that if they felt uncomfortable during the\nprayer, they could wait in the restroom until it was over.\nFollowing that game, Magistro received several more\ncomplaints.\n\n                               7\n\f        On October 6, 2005, the School District’s counsel, Martin\nPachman, advised Magistro and the East Brunswick Board of\nEducation (“Board”) regarding Borden’s conduct, stating that a\ncoach for the school could not lead, encourage, or participate in\nstudent prayer. Magistro met with Borden the next day,\nOctober 7, 2005, and told him that all prayer needed to be\nstudent initiated, including the selection of which student would\nrecite the prayer. At that time, Borden asked her if he could\ncontinue to say the pre-game prayer in the locker room. In\nresponse, Magistro contacted Pachman, who answered Borden’s\nquestions. At the end of the conversation, Magistro asked\nPachman to provide clear guidelines on faculty participation in\nstudent prayer.\n\n        Later that day, Magistro sent Borden a memorandum and\nattached the guidelines provided by Pachman. Magistro stated\nthat she recognized Borden’s disappointment, but she expected\nhim to comply with the guidelines, and “[n]ot to comply will be\nviewed as insubordination.” The attached guidelines, which\nstated that they were not “exhaustive or final,” were as follows:\n\n       “1.    Students have a constitutional right to\n              engage in prayer on school property, at\n              school events, and even during the course\n              of the school day, provided that:\n\n              A.     The activity is truly student\n                     initiated; and\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f     B.     The prayer activity does not\n            interfere with the normal operations\n            of the school district.\n\n     This would mean that, for example, if a\n     student or a group of students wish to\n     engage in a prayer before or after their\n     meal in the cafeteria during their lunch\n     period they would have a right to do so,\n     provided that the activity in which they are\n     engaged does not disrupt the normal\n     operation and decorum of the other\n     students eating in the cafeteria. Also, if\n     student athletes on their own decide to\n     hold a prayer huddle before a game, after\n     a game, or during half-time, they have a\n     right to do so.\n\n2.   Neither the school district nor any\n     representative of the school district\n     (teacher, coach, administrator, board\n     member, etc.) may constitutionally\n     encourage, lead, initiate, mandate, or\n     otherwise coerce, directly or indirectly,\n     student prayer at any time in any school-\n     sponsored setting, including classes,\n     practices, pep rallies, team meetings, or\n     athletic events.\n\n3.   Representatives of the school district, as\n     referenced above, cannot participate in\n\n                      9\n\f             student-initiated prayer. That very issue\n             was decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of\n             Appeals in a decision cited with approval\n             by the United States Supreme Court and is,\n             therefore, the operative law of the land at\n             this time. To quote the Court, ‘If while\n             acting in their official capacities (school\n             district) employees join hands in a prayer\n             circle or otherwise manifest approval and\n             solidarity with student religious exercises,\n             they cross the line between respect for\n             religion and endorsement of religion,’ and\n             such conduct was prohibited.”2\n\nThat same evening, Borden resigned, effective immediately, and\nhe did not attend the football game scheduled for that evening.\nHowever, on October 17, 2005, Borden withdrew his resignation\nand agreed to abide by the School District’s policy for the\nremainder of the 2005 season.\n\n       The Board held a meeting on October 20, 2005. Michael\nBaker, the president of the Board, read a prepared statement\n(“the Board’s statement”). In full, it read:\n\n             “I want to take this opportunity on behalf\n      of the Board of Education, to make some remarks\n      regarding the events that have transpired with our\n      football coach. First and foremost, Dr. Magistro\n\n      2\n       A similar memorandum was sent out to the entire staff\non October 10.\n\n                              10\n\fhas acted professionally, appropriately and\nrespectfully. She has represented the district and\nthe Board of Education with dignity and class.\nWe sincerely thank her and appreciate the way\nshe has conducted herself. We have instructed\nDr. Magistro to get on with running the district\nand to defer any continuing distractions in this\nmatter to our attorney, Mr. Pachman[,] or to the\nBoard of Education.\n\n        Coach Borden, after reconsidering his\ndecision, has rescinded his resignation and\ncontinues as coach of the team. He will conduct\nhimself in a manner that is in compliance with the\nlaw. We do not believe that there was any\ndeliberate attempt or motive from him to do\notherwise. We respect the rights of any employee\nto disagree with policies, procedures and legal\ninterpretations, but cannot and will not tolerate\nviolations of these rules by any employee of the\ndistrict. Each of us up here, are elected to serve\nthis community and take an oath of office to\nrespect and defend the Constitution of the United\nStates and there is no ambiguity or gray area for\nus in understanding this oath. We will, whenever\nconfronted, follow the laws of our land regardless\nof personal views or interpretations of these laws.\nOur employees will do the same. It is our\nuncompromising expectation that Coach Borden’s\npersonal agenda along with his lawyer[’]s, does\nnot in any way interfere with this school district.\n\n                        11\n\fThe Board of Education will continue to see that\nour schools run at the highest of standards and\nwith complete respect for the law and for the\nrights of all of our students and staff. Any\ncomments that come from sources other than the\nBoard of Education, our counsel or the\nSuperintendent are not official and therefore not\nnecessarily representative of our position.\n\n       We are a divided nation and have been\nsince the ratification of our Constitution in 1791.\nIssues of faith are personal and divisive today as\nthey were back then.           This meeting and\nsubsequent [Board of Education] meetings are not\nthe forum for such debate, and legal\n[c]onstitutional rulings are not the purview of the\nBoard of Education. Congress, the President and\nthe Supreme Court[] make, enforce and interpret\nthe laws and these branches of [g]overnment are\nthe appropriate places to lobby for one’s position\non these matters, not here. This is not a platform\nfor individual agendas on [c]onstitutional cases\nthat have already been clearly decided. I will\ntherefore preside over this meeting this evening\nwith these thoughts in mind.\n\n         One of the foundations of our democracy\nis that the right of someone to express concern or\nto bring a matter of discomfort to the attention of\nauthority is to be respected and protected. It is\nnot to be vilified and dishonored. Some of the\n\n                        12\n\f       extreme language, hateful emails and\n       inappropriate and inaccurate reporting of this\n       story, has shifted blame onto the blameless and\n       has distorted beyond measure the matter at hand.\n       If we can do one thing together as a community,\n       it should be to stand up in vast numbers and\n       express outrage and concern against those who\n       would cheapen the actions of brave and\n       committed Americans. No person should have to\n       be afraid to express their constitutionally\n       protected individual rights. Hopefully, we can all\n       learn from this experience and move forward with\n       dignity and respect for each other. Thank you.”3\n\nFollowing the issuance of the October 7 guidelines and the\nBoard’s statement on October 20, Borden conducted himself in\naccordance with the School District’s new policy for the balance\nof the school year, notwithstanding the litigation he instituted on\nNovember 21, 2005.\n\n                        2. 2006-Present\n\n        Prior to the 2006 football season, Borden sent an email\nto Sergio Garcia and Randall Nixon, the co-captains of the team\nfor the 2006 season, requesting that they ask the players whether\nthey would like to continue the tradition of praying at the team\n\n       3\n        Following the media hype created by this case, EBHS\nstudent internet message boards were bombarded with posts,\nseveral of which included derogatory comments based on\nreligion and race.\n\n                                13\n\fdinner and prior to the game. In his email request, he told the\nco-captains that “[w]hatever the players decide to do is fine with\nme.” He asked the captains to pass on the players’ response and\nto ensure him that they spoke with all of the players on the team.\nNixon’s response indicated that the players voted to continue\nboth the pre-meal and pre-game prayer. Following the grant of\nsummary judgment in his favor in this case, Borden stood and\nbowed his head during the prayer before the meal, and remained\non one knee during the pre-game prayer.\n\n                     B. Procedural History\n\n        On November 21, 2005, Borden instituted this litigation\nagainst the School District, the Board of Education, and\nMagistro in her capacity as Superintendent (collectively, “the\ndefendants”) in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The\ndefendants removed the suit to the United States District Court\nfor the District of New Jersey on December 22, 2005. Rather\nthan seeking to continue to do what he had done for the previous\ntwenty-three years, Borden sought “to show his respect for his\nplayers, respect for The Team Prayers, and respect for East\nBrunswick’s football tradition by engaging in two silent acts\nduring The Team Prayers: (i) bowing his head during grace; and\n(ii) taking a knee with his team in the locker room.” His\ncomplaint alleged that the guidelines and the Board’s statement\nprevented him from undertaking either of these activities.\n\n        Borden’s complaint presented two causes of action.\nUnder Count 1, Borden alleged that the defendants violated his\nrights as embodied in Articles 1, 4, 6 and 18 of the New Jersey\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fConstitution.4 Count 2 alleged that the defendants violated his\nDue Process and Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. For both of these\ncounts, Borden sought the same relief: (1) a declaratory\njudgment stating that the guidelines issued on October 7 and the\nBoard’s statement on October 20 were unconstitutional based on\nthe respective constitutional provisions; (2) preliminary and\npermanent injunctions preventing the defendants from enforcing\nthe guidelines and the Board’s statement, or from “taking any\naction of any kind, by way of complaint or otherwise, against\nCoach Borden” for his silent acts of bowing his head and taking\na knee during the team’s prayers; and (3) an order vacating the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement.\n\n        The School District filed a motion for summary judgment\nthat primarily focused on whether its policy was proper under\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence, arguing that it did not violate\nthe Free Exercise Clause, and its policy was necessary because\nBorden’s prayer activities violated the Establishment Clause.\nBorden filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, and\n\n       4\n        In fact, it appears that Borden was not referring to\nArticles of the New Jersey Constitution, but paragraphs under\nArticle 1. While Article 1 of the New Jersey Constitution\nestablishes individual rights, Article 4 establishes the powers of\nthe New Jersey Legislature, Article 6 establishes the powers of\nthe judiciary in New Jersey, and Article 18 does not exist. In\ncontrast, the relevant paragraphs of Article 1 provide the\nfollowing rights: liberty (para. 1), free exercise of religion (para.\n4), freedom of speech (para. 6), and freedom of association\n(para. 18). See N.J. Const. art 1, ¶¶ 1, 4, 6, 18.\n\n                                 15\n\fexpressly stated that he was not asserting a claim under the Free\nExercise Clause despite his citation of paragraph 4 of the New\nJersey Constitution in his complaint. Borden argued that “his\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment United States constitutional\nrights as well as Article 1 ¶¶ 1, 6 of his New Jersey\nconstitutional rights” protect his “symbolic conduct.”5 Further,\nBorden argued that the School District’s justification for its\npolicy was based on an erroneous interpretation of the\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n\n       5\n        Borden did not specifically assert a claim as to his rights\nunder the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nHis complaint did, however, state a claim as to his Due Process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution. Thus, Borden arguably asserted a claim under the\nFirst Amendment because an individual’s free speech rights\nunder the First Amendment apply to the states through the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gitlow v.\nNew York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100708\"><a href=\"/opinion/100708/gitlow-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1925). The defendants have not\nargued that Borden did not assert a claim under the First\nAmendment. Even if they had, however, it would not change\nour analysis, because Borden stated a claim under the free\nspeech clause of the New Jersey Constitution, which has\nprotections that are “generally interpreted as co-extensive with\nthe First Amendment.” Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1980177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1980177/state-tp-of-pennsauken-v-schad/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169 (N.J. 1999) (citing Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v.\nVerniero, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1951993\"><a href=\"/opinion/1951993/hamilton-amuse-center-v-verniero/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. 1998)). Thus, while we do not\nreach a conclusion on whether he stated a free speech claim\nunder the First Amendment, we will assume that he did for the\npurposes of our analysis.\n\n                                16\n\f       On July 25, 2006, the District Court heard oral argument\non the summary judgment motions, and following argument,\nJudge Cavanaugh entered his decision on the record from the\nbench. He stated:\n\n      “I agree that an Establishment Clause violation\n      would occur if the coach initiated and led the\n      activity, but I find nothing wrong with remaining\n      silent and bowing one’s head and taking a knee as\n      a sign of respect for his players’ actions and\n      traditions, nor do I believe would a reasonable\n      observer.\n\n             I believe to preclude the Plaintiff from\n      such an action would be a violation of his rights.\n      I believe the Directives as stated are overbroad\n      and vague. To threaten the Plaintiff with\n      insubordination if he is to participate places him\n      in an untenable position.\n\n             I find that the Plaintiff’s request to bow his\n      head in silence and take a knee do not violate the\n      Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\n              I find, further, that the Defendants’\n      directive regarding the Plaintiff’s nonparticipation\n      is over broad and vague, and violates the\n      Plaintiff’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights\n      to free speech, freedom of association, academic\n      freedom, as well as New Jersey’s constitutional\n      rights to liberty and free speech.\n\n                               17\n\f              Accordingly, since there are no issues of\n       material fact left in dispute, as a matter of law, I\n       deny the Defendants’ motion and grant the\n       Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.”\n\nOn July 26, 2006, the District Court entered an order denying\nthe defendants’ motion for summary judgment, granting\nBorden’s cross-motion for summary judgment, and awarding\nBorden costs and counsel fees. The defendants’ timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                II.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367(a). We have\njurisdiction over final judgments of the District Court under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.6 We exercise plenary review over a district\n\n       6\n        Borden argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this\nappeal because it has become moot. He argues that he only\nsought relief for the 2006 season, and because his coaching\ncontract is subject to annual renewal, a live controversy, as\nrequired by Article III, Section 2 of the United States\nConstitution, no longer exists. However, this appeal contains\nthe factors necessary to warrant a finding that it is not moot. See\nCity of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118353\"><a href=\"/opinion/118353/erie-v-paps-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (2000). First, the\nSchool District has an ongoing injury. See id. at 288; see also\nCongregation Kol Ami v.

The District Court’s decision did not pertain to the\n2006 season alone. Instead, the District Court found that the\nguidelines were overbroad and vague, which invalidates the\n\n                                18\n\fcourt’s grant of summary judgment, and will uphold the district\ncourt’s grant of a summary judgment motion on any basis so\nlong as that basis was previously presented to the district court.\nNasir v.

See Virginia v.\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130149\"><a href=\"/opinion/130149/virginia-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118-19 (2003) (stating that where a court\ndetermines that a statute or policy is overbroad, that ruling\n“invalidate[s] all enforcement of that law”). Second, Borden\ncontinues to have an interest in the present case. See Pap’s\nA.M., 529 U.S. at 288. He is likely to be rehired as the football\ncoach each year because the School District has rehired him\neach year for twenty-five consecutive years, and more\nimportantly, the School District’s guidelines affect him at all\ntimes as a tenured teacher at EBHS. Finally, “this is not a run\nof the mill voluntary cessation case . . . [because] it is the\nplaintiff who, having prevailed below, now seeks to have the\ncase declared moot.” See id. As in Pap’s A.M., we have an\ninterest in preventing litigants from “manipulat[ing] the Court’s\njurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review.” Id.\nTherefore, the case before us is not moot, and we have\njurisdiction to review it.\n\n                               19\n\fvague. It also found that the policy was unconstitutional in its\napplication to Borden because it violated Borden’s constitutional\nrights to freedom of speech, academic freedom, freedom of\nassociation, and due process. Finally, it found that Borden’s\nrequested silent acts of bowing his head and taking a knee while\nhis team prayed would not violate the Establishment Clause.\nWe address each of these issues in turn.\n\n               A. Overbreadth and Vagueness\n\n      Borden challenged the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement on their face, arguing that they are unconstitutionally\noverbroad and vague. The District Court agreed. For the\nreasons that follow, the District Court’s conclusions are\nerroneous.\n\n                        1. Overbreadth\n\n        Under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, a\nperson may challenge a statute or policy, even though it is not\nunconstitutional as applied to that particular person, because\n“[its] very existence may cause others not before the court to\nrefrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.”\nBroadrick v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (1973). A court\nmust consider that the overbreadth doctrine is “strong medicine”\nthat should be used “sparingly and only as a last resort.” Id. at\n613. As a result, “a single impermissible application” is\ninsufficient to deem a statute or policy invalid, New York v.\nFerber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 772 (1982) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted), and instead, “a law should not be invalidated\n\n\n\n                               20\n\ffor overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number of\nimpermissible applications.” Id. at 771.\n\n       Thus, the proper inquiry is whether a statute or policy\n“prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.”\nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (2002).\nTo determine how broad the statute or policy sweeps, we look\nto four factors: (1) “the number of valid applications,” (2) “the\nhistoric or likely frequency of conceivably impermissible\napplications,” (3) “the nature of the activity or conduct sought\nto be regulated,” and (4) “the nature of the state interest\nunderlying the regulation.” Gibson v. Mayor & Council of\nWilmington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784772\"><a href=\"/opinion/784772/christopher-gibson-v-mayor-and-council-of-the-city-of-wilmington-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Based upon the Gibson factors, we conclude that the\nSchool District’s guidelines and the Board’s statement are not\nunconstitutionally overbroad. Borden argues that this policy\nwill reach beyond impermissible faculty involvement in prayer\nand, in addition, will prohibit permissible faculty religious\nexercise. We will address the two relevant paragraphs of the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement separately.\n\n        Paragraph two of the guidelines prohibits a school\nofficial from “encourag[ing], lead[ing], initiat[ing], mandat[ing],\nor otherwise coerc[ing]” students into prayer. For this\nparagraph, the number of valid applications is immense. The\nSupreme Court has held that a school district is in violation of\nthe Establishment Clause where “the degree of school\ninvolvement makes it clear that the [prayer activities] bear the\nimprint of the State and thus put school-age children who\n\n                                21\n\fobjected in an untenable position.” Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist.\nv. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118377\"><a href=\"/opinion/118377/santa-fe-independent-school-dist-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (2000) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Thus, if a school “affirmatively sponsors the\nparticular religious practice of prayer,” it is in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 313. Paragraph two of the\nguidelines strikes at the heart of this prohibition. Generally, if\na school official is engaging in student prayer to the extent that\nthey are leading it, initiating it, or requiring it, the school\nofficial, and thus the school district, is violating the\nEstablishment Clause. In fact, Borden does not point to a\npossible misapplication of this portion of the guidelines.\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has noted that “compliance with\nthe Establishment Clause is a state interest sufficiently\ncompelling to justify content-based restrictions on speech.”\nCapitol Square Review & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117966\"><a href=\"/opinion/117966/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n761-62 (1995). Therefore, paragraph two of the guidelines is\nnot unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n        Paragraph three of the guidelines prohibits a school\nofficial from “participat[ing]” in any student-initiated prayer.\nThis paragraph of the guidelines similarly has numerous valid\napplications. A school district also violates the Establishment\nClause if “a reasonable observer familiar with the history and\ncontext of the display would perceive the display as a\ngovernment endorsement of religion.” Modrovich v.

Not every religious display of a school official will have\nthe necessary “history and context” to be an Establishment\nClause violation, but to the extent that this paragraph is\n\n                                22\n\foverbroad, it is not so substantial as to make the guidelines\ninvalid. Rather, any concern about overbreadth may “be cured\nthrough case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its\nsanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.” Broadrick, 413 U.S.\nat 615-16. Moreover, the School District is equally as interested\nin avoiding Establishment Clause violations in this way.\nTherefore, paragraph three of the guidelines is not\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n        Borden also takes issue with the Board’s statement that\nit “cannot and will not tolerate violations of these rules by any\nemployee of the district,” arguing that the statement does not\ndescribe what conduct it prohibits. However, the statement\nbegan, “[w]e respect the rights of any employee to disagree with\npolicies, procedures and legal interpretations.” It is obvious to\nus that the rules to which the Board is referring are the recently\npromulgated guidelines that had been distributed to all faculty\nonly ten days before the October 20 meeting. Because the\nOctober 20 statement is simply referring to teachers following\nthe School District’s guidelines, the same analysis applies to it\nas to the guidelines themselves. For the same reasons, we find\nthat the Board’s statement is not unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n                          2. Vagueness\n\n        In a void-for-vagueness challenge, we must ensure that\na statute or standard is fair in that it is not so vague that a party\nwould not know what conduct is prohibited. San Filippo v.\nBongiovanni, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581534\"><a href=\"/opinion/581534/joseph-san-filippo-jr-v-michael-bongiovanni-anthony-s-cicatiello/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1136 (3d Cir. 1992). Thus, a\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague when “men of common\nintelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.” Broadrick,\n\n                                 23\n\f413 U.S. at 607 (quoting Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100759\"><a href=\"/opinion/100759/connally-v-general-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (1926)). The inquiry is completed on a case-by-case\nbasis, and the party opposing the statute or standard must show\nthat it is vague as applied to him. San Filippo, 961 F.2d at 1136.\nIn completing this analysis, it is important to note that, in the\ncivil context, statutes need not be as precise as in the criminal\ncontext and are, therefore, less likely to be invalidated under a\nvoid-for-vagueness challenge. Id. at 1135. Borden claims that\nthe use of the word “participate” renders the guidelines\nunconstitutionally vague. Standing alone, the word “participate”\nmay be vague. However, “participate” cannot be read in\nisolation, but must be read in the context of the entire paragraph\ndiscussing the prohibition on faculty participation with student-\ninitiated prayer. The paragraph prohibiting faculty participation\nelaborates on what it considered participation by quoting from\nthe Fifth Circuit’s decision in Doe v. Duncanville Independent\nSchool District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708076\"><a href=\"/opinion/708076/john-doe-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-jane-doe-a-minor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1995). Thus, the faculty,\nincluding Borden, knew that the prohibition on participating in\nprayer with students included joining hands in prayer or\ndemonstrating some approval of or solidarity with students’\nprayer. Such a description is “‘sufficiently explicit to inform\nthose who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render\nthem liable to its penalties . . . consonant alike with ordinary\nnotions of fair play and the settled rules of law.’” San Filippo,\n961 F.2d at 1136 (quoting Connally, 269 U.S. at 391).\n\n       Moreover, we find support that the word “participate” is\nnot vague from the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of\nEducation of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112451\"><a href=\"/opinion/112451/board-of-ed-of-westside-community-schools-dist-66-v-mergens/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). In Mergens, a school district refused access to a\nChristian student group, and the group brought suit arguing that\n\n                               24\n\fthe school district was in violation of the Equal Access Act, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 4071 et seq., which prohibits public secondary\nschools from denying equal access to student groups. 496 U.S.\nat 232-33. The school district responded that the Act violated\nthe Establishment Clause and thus was unconstitutional. Id. at\n233. However, the Court held that the Act did not violate the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 253. In reaching its decision, the\nCourt relied extensively on a provision of the Act that limited\nthe faculty involvement permissible in any student religious\ngroups to a “nonparticipatory capacity.” 496 U.S. at 236, 251-\n53 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 4071(c)(3)). The Act does not define\n“nonparticipatory capacity,” and the Court did not define it\neither. Nevertheless, the Court found that the provision\nremoved the risk of both “official state endorsement or\ncoercion,” id. at 251, and excessive entanglement with religion,\nid. at 253, because it removed the possibility that school\nofficials would be “participating” in the students’ religious\nactivities.    Considering the Court’s reliance on the\n“nonparticipatory” provision of the Act without a definition of\nwhat the word “participate” means, it is difficult to conceive\nhow the School District’s guidelines could be so vague that\npeople of common intelligence could not “guess at [their]\nmeaning.” Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 607. Therefore, for all of the\nabove reasons, we find that the guidelines are not\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n          B. As-Applied Constitutional Challenges\n\n        In addition to arguing that the policy prohibiting faculty\nparticipation in student-initiated prayer was unconstitutional on\nits face, Borden also challenged the policy as it applied to him,\n\n                               25\n\farguing that it violated his constitutional rights to freedom of\nspeech, academic freedom, freedom of association, and due\nprocess. The District Court agreed. Again, for the reasons that\nfollow, the District Court’s conclusion is erroneous.\n\n                     1. Freedom of Speech\n\n       The first issue is whether the School District’s guidelines\nand the Board’s statement violated Borden’s right to freedom of\nspeech under the New Jersey Constitution and the First\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.7 The First\nAmendment states that “Congress shall make no law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech . . . .” U.S. Const. amend. I.\nThis provision applies to the states through the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gitlow v.

See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148-54; Pickering, 391 U.S.\nat 568.\n\n        To determine whether the First Amendment protects a\npublic employee’s speech, the Supreme Court has established a\ntwo-prong test. Under the first prong, the court must determine\nwhether the employee is speaking upon matters of public\nconcern. Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. If the employee’s speech\nrelates only to his or her personal interest, the First Amendment\ndoes not protect the speech because “government officials\nshould enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without\nintrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First\nAmendment.” Id. at 146. However, if the employee’s speech is\non a matter of public interest, the second prong is triggered and\nrequires the court to engage in the Pickering balancing test. See\nid. at 150. The balancing is “between the interests of the [public\nemployee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\nconcern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees.” Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.8 Because\n\n       8\n       We reject Borden’s argument that we should apply the\nSupreme Court’s standard in Tinker v.

More importantly, Tinker did not\nalter the test that the Supreme Court established to evaluate the\nspeech of a public employee in Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568, and\nthen Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. Pickering involved a teacher\nwho wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing concern regarding\nthe management of the school district, and the Court held that\nthe teacher, as a public employee, had a right to freedom of\nspeech. 391 U.S. at 574-75. Connick elaborated on the proper\ntest for the speech of a public employee. See 461 U.S. at 146-\n50. Therefore, our application of Pickering and Connick is\nappropriate in these circumstances.\n\n                               28\n\f                  i. Matter of Public Concern9\n\n        Under the test established in Pickering and Connick, we\nmust first determine whether Borden’s silent acts of expression\nare on a matter of public concern. Borden alleges two interests\nthat his silent acts serve: (1) providing the team with feelings of\nunity and increasing team morale; and (2) respecting the\nplayers’ prayers.10 For the reasons that follow, we find that\n\n       9\n         Borden argues that we may not address this issue\nbecause the defendants did not argue that the speech was not on\na matter of public concern in their initial brief or their reply brief\nbefore the District Court. However, “‘[w]hen an issue or claim\nis properly before the court, the court is not limited to the\nparticular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather\nretains the independent power to identify and apply the proper\nconstruction of governing law.’” Tenafly Eruv Assoc., Inc. v.\nBorough of Tenafly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779659\"><a href=\"/opinion/779659/tenafly-eruv-association-inc-chaim-book-yosifa-book-stephanie-dardick/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 n.15 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(quoting Kamen v.

Thus, we must engage in a proper constitutional\nanalysis of whether Borden has a free speech right to engage in\nhis proposed silent acts regardless of what legal theory he or the\ndefendants argued at any point in this litigation. Here, a proper\nconstitutional analysis requires us to consider whether Borden’s\nspeech was on a matter of public concern before we make any\nother determinations. Therefore, not only are we not prohibited\nfrom engaging in step one of the Connick test, we must do so.\n       10\n         To the extent that Borden argues that his speech\nprotects student-initiated prayer, his argument is unfounded. He\nwould like to bow his head during a pre-meal grace and take a\n\n                                 29\n\fBorden’s stated interests are personal to Borden and his team\nand are not matters of public concern.\n\n        Connick instructs that “[w]hether an employee’s speech\naddresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the\ncontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by\nthe whole record.” 461 U.S. at 147-48.11 The content of speech\non a matter of public concern generally addresses a social or\npolitical concern of the community. For example, we have\nstated that speech is on a matter of public concern if it “relate[s]\nto broad social or policy issues,” including expressing the\ndesirability of assassinating the President or complaining about\nracial discrimination.

Finally, the content of speech is on\na matter of public concern where it “relate[s] primarily to the\nway in which a government office [i]s serving the public.”\nSanguigni, 968 F.2d at 398 (citing Czurlanis v.

In short, the content of these\ntypes of speech goes to the core of the First Amendment because\nit adds to the debate on matters of public importance.\n\n        In contrast, the content of an employee’s speech is not a\nmatter of public concern where the comments are only with\nregard to the morale of the office. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148\n(holding that the employee’s questionnaire regarding office\nmorale was not a matter of public concern because she was\nmerely gathering “ammunition” against her supervisors);\nSanguigni, 968 F.2d at 399 (holding that an employee’s\nstatements regarding morale alone do not rise to the level of a\nmatter of public concern). In Connick, the Supreme Court noted\nthat the level of morale in a government office may relate to the\nefficiency of that office, and the public may be interested in that\nefficiency. 461 U.S. at 148. However, where the employee’s\nefforts did not focus on relaying that information to the public,\nit could not be speech on a matter of public concern. Id. at 148\n& n.8.\n\n                                31\n\f        In the present case, Borden portrays the content of his\nconduct as secular gestures intended to promote solidarity, help\nform the team into a cohesive family unit, and show respect for\nthe players’ prayers. The content of his message, however, is\nnot a matter of public concern. Borden does not perform these\nsilent acts as part of a broad social or policy statement of being\nable to take a knee or bow his head in public.12 Additionally, he\nis not shedding light on any matter with regard to EBHS’s\noperations that would be important to the public because his\nsilent acts do not touch upon the way in which a government\ninstitution is discharging its responsibilities. See, e.g.,\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 569-70 (finding that criticisms of a school\ndistrict’s allocations of funds is speech on a matter of public\nconcern). Instead, Borden expressly argues that he wishes to\nengage in this speech out of concern for his team’s morale.\nHowever, he is not trying to bring public morale issues within\nthe school’s administration, but is merely trying to bolster his\nteam by demonstrating that “this team is a family,” which does\nnot amount to a matter of public concern. See Connick,\nteacher’s criticism of the school district in a letter to a\nnewspaper).\n\n        In the present case, the form and context of Borden’s\nsilent acts only reinforce its non-public nature. Borden’s speech\ndoes not occur in any type of official proceeding, and even more\nimportantly, Borden’s speech does not extend into any type of\npublic forum. In fact, Borden himself admits that the bowing of\n\n       12\n        Borden does not allege that his silent acts are religious\nspeech that is on a matter of public concern, and we do not reach\nthat question.\n\n                               32\n\fhis head and taking of a knee occur in private settings, namely\nat an invitation-only dinner and in a closed locker room. Again,\nwe find further support for this decision in the Sixth Circuit’s\nopinion in Dambrot, where the court noted the private nature of\nthe coach’s message to his players because the coach’s pep talk\nwas given in a locker room for the private consumption of his\nplayers. 55 F.3d at 1188. Thus, we conclude that as in\nDambrot, the bowing of Borden’s head and taking a knee are\nmeant for the consumption of the football team only. Therefore,\nBorden’s expressive conduct of bowing his head and taking a\nknee are not matters of public concern triggering protection of\nhis right, as a public employee, to freedom of speech.13\n\n       13\n          Based on our prior decisions, as well as the decisions of\nother courts of appeals, Borden’s actions do not constitute\nspeech on a matter of public concern regardless of the\napplication of the Supreme Court’s most recent case in the line\nof cases on the free speech rights of public employees. See\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Garcetti, the\nCourt considered whether the First Amendment protects a public\nemployee’s speech when the employee speaks pursuant to his or\nher official duties. Id. at 1960. It held that the analysis\nestablished by Pickering and its progeny applies only when an\nemployee speaks as a citizen. Id. Thus, the First Amendment\nsimply does not protect speech made pursuant to the employee’s\nofficial duties. Id. After reaching its conclusion, the Court\nexpressly stated that it left the determination of whether this\nanalysis would apply in the educational context for another day.\nSee id. at 1962 (“We need not, and for that reason do not, decide\nwhether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same\nmanner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or\n\n                                33\n\f                 ii. Pickering Balancing Test\n\n        We find it unnecessary to engage in the Pickering\nbalancing test in the present case because Borden does not have\na free speech right that would trigger the analysis. In order to\nutilize the balancing test, the public employee must have a free\nspeech right to weigh against the government’s interest in\nprohibiting the speech. However, Borden’s silent acts of\nbowing his head and taking a knee are not on matters of public\nconcern so he does not have a free speech right to trigger the\nbalancing test. For the above reasons, we conclude that the\nguidelines and the Board’s statements did not violate Borden’s\nfree speech rights under the First Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution and under the New Jersey Constitution.\n\n                    2. Academic Freedom\n\n       Borden argues that the right to academic freedom affords\nhim the right to exercise professional judgment in teaching his\nplayers respect for others, or as he calls it, “Character\nEducation.” In making this argument, Borden specifically\npoints out that he is both a football coach and a tenured teacher\nat EBHS, and states that “[he] believes in teaching [the players]\nhow to be persons of good character and principle.”\n\n\nteaching.”). If Garcetti applied to this case, Borden’s speech\nwould not be protected as it was made pursuant to his official\nduties as a coach of the EBHS football team and not as an\nordinary citizen. However, even if Garcetti does not apply in\nthe educational context, Borden’s conduct is not on a matter of\npublic concern for the reasons just described.\n\n                               34\n\f        We have held that a teacher’s in-class conduct is not\nprotected speech.

The rationale for this holding is\nthat the teacher is acting as the educational institution’s proxy\nduring his or her in-class conduct, and the educational\ninstitution, not the individual teacher, has the final determination\nin how to teach the students. See Brown v. Armenti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772908\"><a href=\"/opinion/772908/robert-a-brown-v-angelo-armenti-jr-california-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74-75 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n       In order to determine if the teacher’s conduct is\nconsidered in-class conduct, we must determine whether the\nteacher is engaging in one of the “four essential freedoms” that\nconstitute academic freedom. Id. at 75. The “‘four essential\nfreedoms’” include the right of an educational institution “to\nchoose ‘who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be\ntaught, and who may be admitted to study.’” Edwards v. Cal.\nUniv. of Pa., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758042\"><a href=\"/opinion/758042/dilawar-m-edwards-phd-v-california-university-of-pennsylvania-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Regents\nof Univ. of Cal. v.

Based on\nthis analysis, we have previously determined that a teacher’s in-\nclass conduct includes choosing one’s own teaching methods,\nid. at 491-92, utilizing one’s own “classroom management\ntechnique,” Bradley, 910 F.2d at 1176, and assigning grades to\na student, Brown, 247 F.3d at 75.\n\n       In the case before us, Borden concedes that the silent acts\nof bowing his head and taking a knee are tools that he uses to\nteach his players respect and good moral character. Thus, by his\nown admission, his coaching methods are pedagogic. As a\n\n                                35\n\fresult, he is acting as a proxy for the School District, and the\nSchool District may choose both how its students are taught and\nwhat its students are taught. Here, the School District adopted\nPachman’s guidelines because it determined that Borden’s\npedagogic methods were inappropriate. As evidenced by this\ncontinued litigation, the School District continues to find\nBorden’s pedagogic methods of teaching his players respect by\nengaging in his silent acts inappropriate. While Borden\ncertainly has the right to voice his disagreement with the School\nDistrict’s policy, in accord with our past precedent, he does not\nhave a right to act in contravention of the School District’s\npolicy based upon a right to academic freedom.14 For the above\nreasons, the District Court erred in holding that the guidelines\nand the Board’s statement violated Borden’s right to academic\nfreedom.\n\n       14\n         Borden alleges that a decision that he does not have the\nacademic freedom to engage in these acts amounts to controlling\nhis mind.       However, our precedent has consistently\ndemonstrated that it is the educational institution that has a right\nto academic freedom, not the individual teacher. See, e.g.,\nBrown v. Armenti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772908\"><a href=\"/opinion/772908/robert-a-brown-v-angelo-armenti-jr-california-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (3d Cir. 2001). The teacher,\nin turn, has the right to speak on matters of public concern,\nincluding advocating certain pedagogic methods. See Edwards\nv. Cal.

Freedom of Association\n\n       Borden’s complaint also alleged, and the District Court\nheld, that the School District’s guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement violated Borden’s right to freedom of association.\nSpecifically, he asserts that First Amendment jurisprudence\ndemonstrates that the policy infringes on his “right to associate\nwith his players by forcibly segregating [him], both physically\nand mentally, from his players while they engage in the\nimportant team act of saying pre-game prayers.” However, we\nfind this argument unavailing.\n\n        While the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution\nprotects certain relationships, those protected relationships\nrequire a closeness that is not present between a high school\nfootball coach and his team. The Court has not limited the\nprotection to familial relationships, but generally the protected\nrelationships include “marriage, the begetting and bearing of\nchildren, child rearing and education, and cohabitation with\nrelatives.” See Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111879\"><a href=\"/opinion/111879/board-of-directors-of-rotary-intl-v-rotary-club-of-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (1987) (citations omitted); id. at 546-47 (not\nextending the protection to the Rotary Club). We do not doubt\nthat football coaches have a special relationship with the players\non their team. However, the relationship is typically not so\nclose as to involve “‘not only a special community of thoughts,\nexperiences, and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects\nof one’s life.’” Id. at 545 (quoting Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619-20 (1984)). Therefore, we find that the guidelines\nprohibiting him from participating in the players’ prayer\nactivities do not interfere with his freedom of association rights,\n\n\n\n                                37\n\fparticularly because he is violating the Establishment Clause\nwhile doing so. See infra Part III.C.15\n\n                         4. Due Process\n\n       Borden also argues that the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement violated his rights to due process. In the context of\nschool district policies, we have previously stated that the same\n\n       15\n          While Borden’s argument is not entirely clear, he may\nalso be asserting an expressive association claim. To the extent\nthat Borden makes this argument, we deem it to fail. The\nfootball team must be an “expressive association” for it to fall\nwithin the ambit of the First Amendment’s protection. See Boy\nScouts of Am. v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648 (2000). To be an\n“expressive association,” the group does not need to be an\nadvocacy group, but it “must engage in some form of\nexpression, whether it be public or private.” Id. The Supreme\nCourt has held that the Boy Scouts engage in expressive\nassociation because the organization seeks to instill values in the\nyouth members. Id. at 649-50.\n         Borden argues that, as a football coach, he similarly\ninstills values in the members of his team. However, unlike the\nBoy Scouts in Dale, Borden is instilling values in the team as\npart of his duties as a public school employee and not as part of\na private association. As discussed in part III.C of this opinion,\nsee infra, the School District has the right to issue its guidelines,\nparticularly because it needed to prevent Borden from violating\nthe Establishment Clause. Therefore, we find any expressive\nassociation argument that Borden is attempting to make to be\ninvalid.\n\n                                 38\n\ftest for vagueness applies to a procedural due process claim.\nBradley, 910 F.2d at 1177. Thus, a rule prohibiting conduct\nmust not be “in terms so vague that people of common\nintelligence must guess as to its meaning . . . .” Id. As indicated\nby the discussion above, the guidelines and the Board’s\nstatement were not unconstitutionally vague. See supra Part\nIII.A.2.\n\n       Therefore, Borden must point to a fundamental right that\nhe has which the policy infringed upon in order to establish a\ndue process violation. He can do no such thing. Borden tries to\ncite to federal case law regarding privacy rights, such as\nGriswold v. Connecticut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107082\"><a href=\"/opinion/107082/griswold-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965), and Lawrence v.\nTexas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), to argue that the School District has\nintruded upon his privacy, thoughts, autonomy, desires and\nwishes. He claims that the School District’s requirement that he\nnot engage in taking a knee and bowing his head degraded him\nas a person and humiliated him in front of his team. However\nimpassioned Borden’s arguments may be, they lack any basis in\nthe law. Borden has no interest – privacy, liberty, or otherwise\n– in behavior that violates the Establishment Clause.16 For these\n\n       16\n         Borden attempts to argue that the New Jersey\nConstitution provides him greater due process protections than\nthe U.S. Constitution. Under the New Jersey Constitution,\nclaims involving fundamental rights are to be analyzed using a\nbalancing test, “consider[ing] the nature of the affected right, the\nextent to which the governmental restriction intrudes upon it,\nand the public need for the restriction.” Greenberg v.\nKimmelman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381193/greenberg-v-kimmelman/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (N.J. 1985). However, the\nbalancing here has the same result as under federal\n\n                                39\n\freasons, the guidelines and the Board’s statement did not\ninfringe on Borden’s due process rights.\n\n           C. The School District Had a Right to\n       Adopt the Guidelines Because It Was Concerned\n          About Establishment Clause Violations.\n\n        As discussed above, the School District’s guidelines and\nthe Board’s statement were not unconstitutional on their face\nand did not violate Borden’s constitutional rights. We have\npreviously held that, where an official at a public school does\nnot have a First Amendment right to his or her expression, the\nschool district’s policy does not need to be “reasonably related\nto a legitimate educational interest.” See Edwards, 156 F.3d at\n491. Thus, because Borden has no First Amendment right to his\nsilent acts, we do not need to analyze the policy under this\nstandard. However, even if we applied that standard to the\npresent case, we would arrive at the same result: the School\nDistrict had a right to adopt its policy.\n\n        The School District has a legitimate educational interest\nin avoiding Establishment Clause violations, and the guidelines\nare reasonably related to that interest. The Supreme Court has\nstated that “compliance with the Establishment Clause is a state\ninterest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based\nrestrictions on speech.” Pinette, 515 U.S. at 761-62; see also\n\n\nconstitutional principles because the public need – to prohibit\nEstablishment Clause violations, which as discussed below, are\npresent in this case – is so great. Therefore, Borden’s argument\nfails.\n\n                               40\n\fLocke v. Davey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131166\"><a href=\"/opinion/131166/locke-v-davey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 n.2 (2004) (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting) (“[A] State has a compelling interest in not\ncommitting actual Establishment Clause violations.”). If\ncompliance with the Establishment Clause can rise to a\ncompelling state interest, surely it is a legitimate educational\ninterest. Moreover, the guidelines are related to that interest\nbecause, as discussed in the overbreadth and vagueness analysis,\nthe prohibited conduct would violate the Establishment Clause.\nIn fact, based on the history and context of Borden’s conduct in\ncoaching the EBHS football team over the past twenty-three\nyears, Borden is in violation of the Establishment Clause when\nhe bows his head and takes a knee while his team prays.17\n\n       17\n         The defendants suggest that we do not need to reach the\nissue of whether Borden’s requested actions, to bow his head\nand take a knee while his team prays, constitute an\nEstablishment Clause violation. Borden’s complaint did not\nmake any allegations regarding the Establishment Clause; the\nEstablishment Clause only surfaced in the cross-motions for\nsummary judgment to the District Court because the defendants\nthought that Borden was asserting a Free Exercise claim, which\nhe was not. However, in reaching its decision, the District Court\nfound “that the Plaintiff’s request to bow his head in silence and\ntake a knee do not violate the Establishment Clause of the\nConstitution.” This decision was a declaratory judgment\nbecause it “declare[d] the rights and other legal relations” of the\ninterested parties. 28 U.S.C. § 2201. The District Court was\nwithin its right to grant a declaratory judgment. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 57. But we must now review the district court’s decision, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2201, and in reviewing a decision to grant a\ndeclaratory judgment, “we will exercise plenary review over the\n\n                                41\n\f       Under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment,\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion.” U.S. Const. amend.

For example, in Santa Fe, the leading case on prayers\nbefore high school football games, the Supreme Court used the\nendorsement test in considering whether a school district\nviolated the Establishment Clause where its policy allowed a\nstudent to deliver a pre-game prayer based on a voting system.\nId. Here, Borden, an employee of the School District as both the\nhead football coach and a tenured teacher, would like to bow his\nhead and take a knee while students pray. Thus, the\nendorsement test is applicable here because these facts involve\na state employee engaging in the religious activity of students in\nsome fashion.\n\n       The relevant question under the endorsement test is\n“whether a reasonable observer familiar with the history and\ncontext of the display would perceive the display as a\ngovernment endorsement of religion.” Modrovich, 385 F.3d at\n401; see also Am. Civil Liberties Union Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter, 492 U.S. at 596 (adopting the endorsement test). The\ntest does not focus on the government’s subjective purpose\nwhen behaving in a particular manner, but instead focuses on the\nperceptions of the reasonable observer. Modrovich, 385 F.3d at\n401.\n\n       The history and context of Borden’s prayer activities with\nthe team, if challenged, could have been Establishment Clause\nviolations. In a case that is similar to the facts of the present\ncase prior to the School District’s enactment of the policy, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that a basketball\ncoach’s involvement in prayer “signal[ed] an unconstitutional\n\n                               43\n\fendorsement of religion.” Duncanville, 70 F.3d at 406. In\nDuncanville, a basketball coach recited the Lord’s Prayer with\nhis players during practices and after games. Id. at 404. Parents\nof the students challenged this practice, and the district court\ngranted an injunction which prohibited “[the school district], its\nemployees and its agents from: leading, encouraging,\npromoting, or participating in prayers with or among students\nduring curricular or extracurricular activities, including before,\nduring, or after school-related sporting events. . . . Students may\nvoluntarily pray together, provided such prayer is not done with\nschool participation or supervision.” Id. at 405-06. The school\ndistrict challenged the district court’s injunction, arguing that\nthis prohibition violated its employees’ rights to free exercise of\nreligion, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and\nacademic freedom. Id. at 406. The Fifth Circuit disagreed,\nstating that the government’s facilitation of the free exercise of\nreligion or free expression rights cannot “‘supersede the\nfundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause.’”\nId. (quoting Lee v. Weisman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586-87 (1992)). In\naddition, the context of the challenged prayer activities, which\noccurred during “school-controlled” activities that the team must\nattend, demonstrated that the coaches’ “actions [were]\nrepresentative of [school district] policies.” Id. Thus, the Fifth\nCircuit upheld the District Court’s injunction, finding that the\ncoaches’ participation was “an unconstitutional endorsement of\nreligion.” Id.\n\n       Likewise, Borden’s past conduct “signals an\nunconstitutional endorsement of religion.” Id. For twenty-three\nyears, Borden led the team in a pre-game prayer in the locker\nroom. During that same period of time, Borden orchestrated a\n\n                                44\n\fpre-meal grace for his team. He originally had a chaplain\nconduct the pre-meal grace. This practice changed only after\nschool officials asked him to stop; then he had the chaplain write\nthe grace and he selected seniors on the team to recite it.\nAdditionally, during at least three seasons, Borden led the team\nin the first prayer of the season. Both of these activities, the\nlocker room preparations and the pre-game meals, were school-\nsponsored events. As in Duncanville, Borden’s involvement in\nprayer at these two activities – as a participant, an organizer, and\na leader – would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that he\nwas endorsing religion.\n\n        In analyzing Borden’s request to engage in silent acts\nwith his teams, we must consider all of his prior prayer activities\nwith his team as the Supreme Court did in Santa Fe. For many\nyears, the Santa Fe Independent School District began each high\nschool football game with a prayer led by the “Student\nChaplain.” Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 294, 309. After realizing that\nsuch conduct would violate the Establishment Clause, the school\ndistrict developed a two-step student election process, which\nallowed students to (1) first decide whether an invocation would\nbe given at the beginning of a game; and (2) then elect the\nspeaker to give the invocation. Id. at 306. The Supreme Court\nconsidered the many years of pre-game prayers at the school,\nand the evolution of the policy, including the name “Prayer at\nFootball Games” and its stated purpose, which is to\n“solemniz[e]” the occasion. Id. at 308-09. It found that “an\nobjective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably\nperceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her\nschool’s seal of approval.” Id. at 308. Moreover, it stated that\nall of these factors indicated that the purpose of the policy was\n\n                                45\n\fto preserve the popular pre-game prayer, regardless of the\nschool district’s stated purposes. Id. at 309. Thus, it found that\nthe policy failed the endorsement test and violated the\nEstablishment Clause. Id. at 308-10.\n\n        Similarly to Santa Fe and as discussed above, the current\ncontroversy is built upon a significant history of pre-game\nprayers that involved Borden. Borden organized prayers for the\npre-meal grace at the team dinner; he had a chaplain say a\nprayer and then selected seniors to say the prayer. But even\nmore importantly, Borden led prayers himself – on at least three\noccasions for the pre-meal grace, and before each game for\ntwenty-three years for the locker room prayer. Additionally,\nwhen EBHS officials asked Borden to discontinue this conduct,\nhe initially resigned from his position as coach of the team\nrather than continue as coach without engaging in the prayer\nactivities. This history of Borden’s prayers with the football\nteam leads to a reasonable inference that his current requested\nconduct is meant “to preserve a popular ‘state-sponsored\nreligious practice’” of praying with his team prior to games.\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 309 (citing Lee, 505 U.S. at 596).\n\n      Borden has stated that his intention in taking a knee and\nbowing during prayer is to show signs of respect to his team, not\nendorse religion.20 Borden attempts to support this argument by\n\n       20\n         As an employee of the School District as both a coach\nand tenured teacher, Borden’s actions can be imputed to the\nSchool District. For this reason, Borden’s claim that the School\nDistrict could remove any Establishment Clause violation by\nwriting a disclaimer saying that Borden’s speech does not\n\n                               46\n\fpointing to language in Duncanville, which states that “neither\nthe Establishment Clause nor the district court’s order prevent\n[school district] employees from treating students’ religious\nbeliefs and practices with deference and respect; indeed, the\nconstitution requires this. Nothing compels [school district]\nemployees to make their non-participation vehemently obvious\nor to leave the room when students pray . . . .” Duncanville, 70\nF.3d at 406 n.4.21\n\n\nrepresent the ideals of the School District is simply wrong.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has previously suggested\ndisclaimers as a way to demonstrate that a school district is not\nendorsing religion, see Bd. of Educ. v. Mergens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112451\"><a href=\"/opinion/112451/board-of-ed-of-westside-community-schools-dist-66-v-mergens/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n251 (1990), that was only applicable in the context of permitting\nstudent clubs of a religious nature to meet on school grounds.\nThe Court reasoned that “there is little if any risk of official state\nendorsement or coercion where no formal classroom activities\nare involved and no school officials actively participate.” Id.\nThe circumstances are different where, as here, a school official\ncould reasonably be perceived as engaging in the students’\nprayer activities. Therefore, a disclaimer by the School District\nwould not remove the Establishment Clause violation.\n       21\n         Borden also invokes the football greats, like Bear\nBryant, to indicate that taking a knee is merely a gesture in the\nland of football. However, although taking a knee in a huddle\nto discuss strategy is a gesture well known to football gurus as\nbeing part of the game, Borden said a prayer while taking a knee\nwith his team for over twenty-three years. Based on this\nundisputed history, a reasonable EBHS player would conclude\nthat Borden is endorsing religion if he continues to take a knee\n\n                                 47\n\f        However, we find Borden’s argument to be unavailing.\nFirst, the inquiry is not whether Borden intends to endorse\nreligion, but whether a reasonable observer, with knowledge of\nthe history and context of the display, would conclude that he is\nendorsing religion. See Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 401.\nAdditionally, Borden fails to note that the Fifth Circuit does not\npermit any respectful display to pass muster in evaluating the\nconstitutionality of the display. See Duncanville, 70 F.3d at 406\nn.4. Instead, the Fifth Circuit, in the sentence immediately\nfollowing the above quote, stated that, “if while acting in their\nofficial capacities, [school district] employees join hands in a\nprayer circle or otherwise manifest approval and solidarity with\nstudent religious exercises, they cross the line between respect\nfor religion and endorsement of religion.” Id. Thus, Borden’s\nreliance on Duncanville is only partially accurate because the\nrespectful display is permissible only if it does not “cross the\nline” and endorse religion.\n\n       We find that, based on the history of Borden’s conduct\nwith the team’s prayers, his acts cross the line and constitute an\nunconstitutional endorsement of religion. Although Borden\nbelieves that he must continue to engage in these actions to\ndemonstrate solidarity with his team, which is perhaps good for\na football team’s unity, we must consider whether a reasonable\nobserver would perceive his actions as endorsing religion, not\nwhether Borden intends to endorse religion. A reasonable\nobserver would have knowledge of Borden’s extensive\ninvolvement with the team’s prayers over the past twenty-three\nyears during which he organized, participated in, and led\n\n\nwhile his team prays.\n\n                               48\n\fprayer.22 Based on this history, we hold that a reasonable\nobserver would conclude that Borden is showing not merely\nrespect when he bows his head and takes a knee with his teams\nand is instead endorsing religion.23\n\n       22\n          Borden argues that the reasonable observer would also\nbe familiar with the School District’s previous treatment of\nreligion. He references Pope v. East Brunswick Board of\nEducation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659861\"><a href=\"/opinion/659861/donna-pope-by-her-guardian-ad-litem-william-pope-v-east-brunswick-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1254 (3d Cir. 1993), a case in which\nthe School District was admonished for searching the Equal\nAccess Act for loopholes that would allow it to deny a religious\nclub access to the school after hours. Borden argues that this\ncase shows the School District’s disdain for religion, and as a\nresult, the reasonable observer would not consider his actions to\nbe religious. However, even if the observer knew of the School\nDistrict’s former problems with religious organizations, the\nobserver would also know that for at least ten years following\nthe Pope case, Borden, a school official, was involved in prayer\nactivities at the team dinner, and even more importantly, led a\nteam prayer before each game. With this knowledge, the\nreasonable observer would view Borden’s conduct as endorsing\nreligion despite any conflicts with religious organizations that\nthe School District had fifteen years ago.\n       23\n         As additional evidence of an Establishment Clause\nviolation, the defendants argue that the pre-game prayers were\nnot truly student initiated. They suggest that by sending the\nemail to the team captains asking them to poll the team about the\nprayers and then asking for the results, Borden himself initiated\nthe prayers. The defendants’ argument is supported by the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 317, which\n\n                               49\n\f       Without Borden’s twenty-three years of organizing,\nparticipating in, and leading prayer with his team, this\nconclusion would not be so clear as it presently is. We agree\nwith Borden that bowing one’s head and taking a knee can be\nsigns of respect.24 Thus, if a football coach, who had never\nengaged in prayer with his team, were to bow his head and take\na knee while his team engaged in a moment of reflection or\nprayer, we would likely reach a different conclusion because the\nsame history and context of endorsing religion would not be\npresent.25 However, in Borden’s case, the conclusion we reach\n\n\nfound that a school district violated the Establishment Clause\nwhen it sponsored a student vote on student-led prayer.\nHowever, we need not make this determination because even if\nthe pre-game prayers were truly student initiated, Borden’s\nparticipation in them by bowing his head and taking a knee\nviolate the Establishment Clause for the reasons discussed.\n       24\n          Judge Barry agrees with this statement. See Con. Op.\nat 70 (Barry, J., concurring) (labeling Borden’s actions as\n“silent, unobtrusive sign[s] of respect”).\n       25\n         In his concurring opinion, Judge McKee points to a\npicture of Borden with his team. See Con. Op. at 55-57\n(McKee, J., concurring). In doing so, he suggests that a\nreasonable observer could “conclude that the coach is praying\nwith his team - perhaps even that he is leading the team in\nprayer,” id., even if there was no history of the coach praying\nwith his team. We cannot agree with this conclusion because\nthis photograph, standing alone, would be insufficient to satisfy\nthe “fact-specific, case-by-case” inquiry required. Id. at 2\n\n                               50\n\ftoday is clear because he organized, participated in, and led\nprayer activities with his team on numerous occasions for\ntwenty-three years. Thus, a reasonable observer would conclude\nthat he is continuing to endorse religion when he bows his head\nduring the pre-meal grace and takes a knee with his team in the\nlocker room while they pray.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the\nguidelines and the Board’s statement were not unconstitutional\non their face, were not unconstitutional as applied to Borden,\nand in fact, were necessary for the School District in order to\navoid Establishment Clause violations. Therefore, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n(quoting Modrovich, 385 F.3d at 402). For a court to complete\nthe required analysis, it would need to consider additional facts,\nincluding, for example: (1) Is the team engaging in a moment\nof silence, or is someone speaking? (2) If a person is speaking,\nis he saying a prayer? (3) If it is a prayer, is it a player or the\ncoach reciting the prayer? and (4) Who decided to say the\nprayer? Only after knowing these facts, as well as the coach’s\nhistory of prayer activities with his team, could any court make\nthe determination required under the endorsement test.\n\n                                51\n\fMcKEE, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n        I join Judge Fisher’s lead opinion, but write separately to\nclarify a few points, and express a few concerns. At the outset,\nI emphasize that we today hold only that (i) the School District’s\npolicy is not overbroad and vague; (ii) the policy did not violate\nBorden’s constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of\nassociation, academic freedom, or due process; and (iii) under\nthe circumstances here, Borden’s practice of bowing his head\nand “taking a knee” as his team prays violates the Establishment\nClause.26\n\n       However, I do not join my colleagues’ suggestion that we\nmight reach a different result here absent Borden’s 23-year\nhistory of promoting team prayer. That question is not before\nus, and I believe that Borden’s “respectful display,” see Con.\nOp., infra, at 69 (Barry, J., concurring), might well violate the\nEstablishment Clause even absent his 23-year history.\nSimilarly, I can not agree that the football team’s pregame ritual\ncan accurately be characterized as “student-initiated” prayer.\n\n                                I.\n\n       In reaching our holding, the lead opinion suggests: “[I]f\na football coach, who had never engaged in prayer with his\nteam, were to bow his head and take a knee while his team\nengaged in a moment of reflection or prayer, we would likely\n\n       26\n        Both of my colleagues, as well as the district court and\nthe parties, refer to Borden’s conduct as “taking a knee.”\nAccordingly, I will also use that phrase.\n\n                                52\n\freach a different conclusion . . . .” Supra, at 52; see also Con.\nOp., infra, at 71 (Barry, J., concurring). I am not as sure.\nAlthough I agree that would be a more difficult case, it is not\nclear to me that our Establishment Clause inquiry would yield\na different result. “[E]very Establishment Clause challenge\nrequires a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis.” Modrovich v.\nAllegheny County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787961\"><a href=\"/opinion/787961/andy-modrovich-james-moore-v-allegheny-county-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402 (3d Cir. 2004). As\ndiscussed in the lead opinion, our Establishment Clause inquiry\nhere turns on whether an objective observer would interpret\nBorden’s proposed actions as a state endorsement of religion.\nSupra, at 38. I believe such an observer could interpret\nBorden’s proposed actions as an endorsement of religion even\nabsent the coach’s history of promoting team prayer.\n\n          Coach Borden’s suit against the School District did not\nseek a declaration “permitting him to pray with his players,”\nBorden’s Br. at 9, but rather “a declaration that he be allowed\n. . . to continue to demonstrate respect for his players by silently\nbowing his head and taking a knee during The Team Prayers.”\nCompl. ¶ 18. However, as Judge Fisher’s lead opinion explains,\nit is not Coach Borden’s subjective intent that controls whether\nhis conduct runs afoul of the Establishment Clause. Rather, the\nquestion at the heart of the endorsement test, is whether an\nobjective observer would perceive that Borden, and by extension\nthe School District and therefore the state, is advancing or\npromoting religious practice. Here, if Coach Borden silently\nbows his head and takes a knee as he requests, even without\nknowledge of Borden’s 23-year history of involvement with pre-\ngame prayer, any such observer who peered into East\n\n\n\n\n                                53\n\fBrunswick’s locker room before a game would probably\nobserve something very much like the following:27\n\n\n\n\n       27\n          In fairness, it is important to note that when asked at\noral argument, counsel for Coach Borden was not able to\nconfirm that this picture, submitted in the School District’s\nReply Brief, accurately depicts the pregame prayers after the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment. The photograph\nwas not entered into evidence in the district court. However, it\nis not disputed that the coach in the picture is Coach Borden,\nand counsel for Borden did not claim that the picture is\ninaccurate. Regardless of when it was taken, it certainly appears\nto be what an objective observer would see if he/she were to\nobserve the coach “silently bowing his head and taking a knee.”\nCompl. ¶ 18. In his brief to this court, Borden states that after\nthe district court invalidated the School District’s policy, he\n“silently bowed his head and took a knee with his players while\nhis players prayed before every game during the 2006 season.”\nBorden’s Br. at 3. (This photograph was downloaded from the\nBoston Globe web site, and is available at\nhttp://www.boston.com/sports/schools/gallery/\n11_07_06_grossfeld_prayer/) (last viewed March 12, 2008).\n\n                               54\n\f        It would be neither surprising nor unreasonable if that\nobserver were to conclude that the coach is praying with his\nteam - perhaps even that he is leading the team in prayer. Such\na conclusion would certainly be buttressed by knowledge of\nCoach Borden’s history of involvement in team prayer, but the\nabsence of that history would not necessarily yield a different\nresult.\n\n\n\n\n                              55\n\f                               II.\n\n        Another troubling consideration (which I amplify below)\nis that a non-religious student or one who adheres to a minority\nreligion might feel subtle (albeit unintentional) coercion to\nparticipate in the ritual despite disagreement or discomfort with\nit. That raises a serious Establishment Clause issue under the\nSupreme Court’s “coercion” test.28\n\n        The district court accepted the argument that the prayer\nthat occurred after October 7, 2005, was “student-initiated.” (JA\n37). It clearly was not. I have no doubt that Coach Borden is a\nsincere and remarkably dedicated individual who cares deeply\nfor his players. He is also a very successful coach.\nUnfortunately, in an apparent desire to do what he thought was\n\n       28\n         The Supreme Court has applied the “coercion” test as\nwell as the “endorsement” test in determining whether state\naction violates the Establishment Clause in the public school\ncontext.

(JA\n497). The captains then personally phoned every member of the\nfootball team. Not surprisingly, given the non-anonymous\nnature of the poll, no player objected. Given the uproar this\nissue visited on the community, the players must have known\nhow important prayer was to their coach - and no high school\nathlete would want to disappoint the coach, or (as I shall\nexplain) risk incurring the communal wrath that had been visited\non the unfortunate cheerleaders the year before.29\n\n       I am not suggesting that Coach Borden intentionally\npressured his players into voting for pregame prayer ceremonies\nor that he wanted to manipulate the outcome.

In the fall of 2005,\nSuperintendent Magistro received a phone call from a “crying\nand overwrought” woman who identified herself as the mother\nof an East Brunswick football player. (JA 153-59, 451). The\nmother complained that her son “was extremely upset at Mr.\nBorden’s fostering and participating in prayer amongst the\nfootball players.” (Id. at 451). When Magistro asked why her\nson participated in the team prayers despite his discomfort, the\nmother responded that he “was fearful that if he did not go along\nwith what was obviously the coach’s desire, he would not get\nplaying time.” (Id.). The call was one of the factors that led to\nthe School District policy Borden challenges.\n\n       Unfortunately, the coach appears not to have considered\nthe possibility that the tradition he wanted to foster could be\ntroubling for some players and possibly deter others from\nplaying football at all. The Supreme Court addressed an\nanalogous situation in Lee. There, the Court held that a public\nschool could not force nonbelievers to choose between\nparticipating in prayer or missing their graduation ceremony.\n\n       Attendance [at graduation] may not be required\n       by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student\n       is not free to absent herself from the graduation\n       exercise in any real sense of the term “voluntary,”\n\n                                58\n\f       for absence would require forfeiture of those\n       intangible benefits which would have motivated\n       the student through youth and all her high school\n       years.\n\nLee, 505 U.S. at 595. Participation in high school athletics is no\nless important than attending one’s high school graduation.\nIndeed, the ongoing involvement with high school athletics is\nundoubtedly far more important to some than a one-time\ngraduation ceremony. High school sports have long been a\ncentral part of our communities and they shape the character of\nmany teenagers far more than a single graduation ceremony.\n\n        Regrettably, Coach Borden as a teacher (and therefore as\na state actor for purposes of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments) failed to appreciate that others may not agree with\nhis beliefs or that the religious beliefs that he held dear might be\nin tension with contrary (but equally valid) beliefs of some of\nhis players. Any player who held opposing beliefs should not\nhave had to “go along to get along” by silently participating in\nreligious observances he disagreed with.\n\n       For, “the government may no more use social\n       pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use\n       more direct means.” . . . “[W]hat to most believers\n       may seem nothing more than a reasonable request\n       that the nonbeliever respect their religious\n       practices, in a school context may appear to the\n       nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to\n       employ the machinery of the State to enforce a\n       religious orthodoxy.” . . .

This record\ncontains powerful evidence of such division.\n\n        Superintendent Magistro testified that she received\ntelephone calls in September 2005 from some parents of\ncheerleaders. They complained that their daughters were\n“uncomfortable” when Borden initiated a prayer at a pregame\ndinner. (JA 153-56). Students apparently learned of these\ncomplaints, and blamed two Jewish cheerleaders. Thereafter,\nthose cheerleaders were publicly ridiculed by other students at\nathletic events, and the cheerleading squad was taunted, bullied,\nand booed. (JA 452 at ¶ 5). The cheerleaders were even\n\n                                61\n\fharassed and threatened on a student internet “blog.” In the\ndays following Coach Borden’s resignation, several internet\nposts appeared under the heading, “Jewish Cheerleaders who\nsuck!!!.” The following are a few examples of the disgusting\ncomments that were posted:\n\n      •      “First they crucify Jesus, then they got\n             Borden fired . . . . Jews gotta learn to stop\n             ruining everything cool.” (JA 460)\n\n      •      “The jew is wrong. Borden is right. Let\n             us pray.” (JA 467)\n\n      •      “d**n jews . . . then you wonder why\n             hitler did what he did back in the day.” (JA\n             471)\n\n      •      “MAYBE if [Borden] held a gun to the\n             jjjjewwws head and was like b*tch get on\n             ur knees and pray to jesus!! then that\n             might be breaking the law...ehhh maybe\n             not! . . . just suck it up if u don’t fu*king\n             like whats going on in america then GO\n             THE FU*K BACK TO YOUR\n             COUNTRY AND STAY THERE AND\n             PRAY . . . .” (JA 487-88)\n\n      •      “Heil Hitla!!! sieg heill.” (JA 490)31\n\n      31\n       Borden’s counsel, in his brief and at oral argument,\nurged us to disregard evidence of parents’ calls to the\n\n                              62\n\fSuperintendent and harassment of the cheerleaders:\n\n      [E]very assertion cited to by [the School District]\n      to support every alleged parent or student\n      complaint about Borden’s pre-October 7, 2005[,]\n      activity is based on hearsay that is derived from\n      anonymous sources that the [School] District\n      refused to identify.       Defendants have not\n      submitted a single sworn, or even unsworn,\n      statement from any alleged complaining student\n      or parent. Nor has the [School] District disclosed\n      the name of any alleged complaining student or\n      parent.\n\nBorden’s Br. at 16-17. However, given the nature of these\nvenomous comments, counsel can not seriously suggest that the\nevidence be ignored merely because students and parents who\nopposed Coach Borden’s policy were not willing to identify\nthemselves and offer direct testimony. The situation is neither\nnew nor unique. In Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe,\nthe Court noted that the district court permitted students and\nparents to litigate anonymously. 530 U.S. at 294. The\nopprobrium that can await those who publicly state their\nopposition to prayer in school is evident from the Court’s\nopinion in Santa Fe:\n\n      About a month after the complaint was filed, the\n      District Court entered an order that provided in\n      part: “[A]ny further attempt on the part of District\n      or school administration, . . . teachers, employees\n\n                              63\n\f       These exchanges illustrate the continuing relevance of\nJustice O’Connor’s admonition that “[e]ndorsement sends a\nmessage to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full\nmembers of the political community, and an accompanying\nmessage to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of\nthe political community.” Lynch v. Donnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688\n(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring). The School District\nattempted to address these concerns by adopting the policy that\nthe district court struck down in the face of Coach Borden’s\nchallenge. In reversing the district court, we help to ensure the\ncontinued vitality of the Establishment Clause as well as the\nrights of all to worship as they please.\n\n\n\n\n       or servants of the School District, parents,\n       students or anyone else, . . . to ferret out the\n       identities of the Plaintiffs in this cause, by means\n       of bogus petitions, questionnaires, individual\n       interrogation, or downright ‘snooping’, will cease\n       immediately.\n\nId. at 294 n.1 (alteration in original). The district court had to\nthreaten contempt sanctions and criminal liability to protect\nthe parents and students who objected to the practice of prayer\nat football games. Id.\n\n                               64\n\fBARRY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n        There was no question, and the parties clearly\nunderstood, that there was one predominant issue before the\nDistrict Court: whether the actions in which Borden wished to\nengage would violate the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment, not whether the conduct in which he had engaged\nwould pass constitutional muster. Put in specific terms, the\nparties and the District Court focused their attention on how this\npublic high school football coach could react, consistent with\nthe Establishment Clause, when members of his team decide to\ninitiate voluntary prayers at a pre-game meal attended only by\nplayers, staff, players’ parents, and invited guests, and in the\nlocker room before a game where only players and coaches are\npresent.\n\n        Borden, for his part, represented that, whatever had gone\nbefore, he would no longer pray with the team, move his lips,\njoin his hands with the players, or even close his eyes. Rather,\nthe two silent actions in which he wished to engage – bowing\nhis head and taking a knee when the team decides to pray – are\nto show his “personal respect” for his players and “respect for\nwhat this game entails and what they do to go out there and play\nand give it their all.” The defendants had no problem with that.\nAs Superintendent Magistro put it, “if the courts determine that\n[Borden] taking a knee, bowing his head, is appropriate, that’s\nfine. He can do that. I think that’s what this is all about.”\nAgain, “[i]f the courts come down and say Borden can bow his\nhead, bend his knee, jump on the table, I am going to allow it.”\nThe defendants’ briefs before the District Court on the cross-\nmotions for summary judgment continued that theme. One put\n\n                               65\n\fit this way: “If this Court were to find plaintiff’s actions do not\nimplicate the Establishment Clause, then regardless of what\nConstitutional right plaintiff seeks relief under . . . he would be\nentitled to participate in voluntary, non-disruptive student\nprayers.”\n\n        Suffice it to say that when they were before the District\nCourt, the parties were in good faith trying to avoid an\nEstablishment Clause problem, with defendants explicitly\nagreeing to abide by the District Court’s decision. But\ndefendants did not do so. Rather, now armed with new counsel,\nthey filed an appeal, creating before us a legal landscape that\nbears little or no resemblance to what went on before the District\nCourt and surely causing the temperature of this litigation to\nsoar.\n\n       Given my druthers, I would hold defendants to their word\nand would not entertain, as my distinguished colleagues have so\ngenerously entertained, the new issues and arguments raised on\nthis appeal.32 I will not, however, tarry to push the proverbial\nwaiver rock uphill as to all of those issues and arguments\nbecause I cannot disagree, nor does Judge McKee, with the\nbottom-line conclusions of Judge Fisher’s superb lead opinion\nthat “the guidelines and the Board’s statement were not\nunconstitutional on their face, were not unconstitutional as\n\n       32\n         I would find, for example, that defendants have waived\nthe argument that numerous pedagogical reasons justified the\ndirectives and not just fear of litigation and the argument that\nBorden has no constitutional rights which would limit\ndefendants’ exercise of their discretion.\n\n                                66\n\fapplied to Borden, and in fact, were necessary for the School\nDistrict in order to avoid Establishment Clause violations.”\nThese conclusions are “threshold question[s] necessary to a\nproper analysis of the parties’ [Establishment Clause]\narguments,” before us and so, even if not adequately raised\nbefore the District Court, it is appropriate that we consider them.\nSee Tenafly Eruv Ass’n Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779659\"><a href=\"/opinion/779659/tenafly-eruv-association-inc-chaim-book-yosifa-book-stephanie-dardick/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 n.15 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n        I write separately, however, to express my view that\nwhether or not Borden’s past prayer activities with the team\nsignaled an unconstitutional endorsement of religion – and I\nhave little doubt that they did – a reasonable observer would not\nconclude that the “respectful display” he proposes would violate\nthe Establishment Clause. The lead opinion concludes, in its\nadditional, albeit unnecessary, “hold[ing],” that that display\nwould “cross the line.” It does so, however, as does Judge\nMcKee’s concurring opinion, by having the reasonable observer\nlook only at Borden’s twenty-three years of history with the\nteam’s prayers and the context of the display he proposes.33 Yet\na reasonable observer would not only have knowledge of that\nhistory, but would know of all that has taken place leading up to\n\n       33\n         Judge McKee has included in his concurring opinion a\npicture of unknown date that is not in evidence in this case and\nthus, in my view, not appropriately considered by us. Having\nlost that battle, I agree with Judge Fisher’s assessment of the\npicture and what more would be needed before a reasonable\nobserver could reach the conclusion that Borden was, in fact,\npraying, a conclusion reached by Judge McKee based on the\npicture alone. See Lead Op. at n.25.\n\n                                67\n\fand during this litigation and know that Borden, under oath, has\nrepresented what he will and will not do and that he merely\nwishes to show respect for his players when they pray. A\nreasonable observer would have no reason to believe that\nBorden was lying.\n\n        Moreover, given the limited number of attendees at the\npre-game meal, it is fair to say that a reasonable observer of a\nprayer before that event would be a player, coach, parent, or\ninvited guest, and a reasonable observer when the team takes a\nknee for a pre-game prayer in the locker room would be a player\nor a coach, just as in Santa Fe the observer was “an objective\nSanta Fe High School student.” Santa Fe Ind.

Thus, if and when in the future a\nplayer decides to initiate prayer, the reasonable observer would\nknow, given Borden’s representations, that he did not ask for a\nprayer; did not select someone to say a prayer; did not monitor\nthe content of the prayer; did not provide a means for\nbroadcasting the prayer; did not join his hands with anyone; and\ndid not mouth the words of the prayer, or say it aloud, or\notherwise do anything to put the imprint of the state on the\nprayer. A reasonable observer would simply see Borden bow\nhis head or take a knee in a silent, unobtrusive sign of respect\nfor the private choices made by individual players who are\nconstitutionally permitted to choose to engage in religious\nactivities.

Apparently, it is\nonly Borden, given his prior history, who cannot constitutionally\nrespond to constitutionally protected student-initiated and\nstudent-composed prayer but, if he can, we are not told what\nresponse might be permissible. Surely he would not be required\nto keep his head erect or turn his back or stand and walk away.34\nAny such requirement would evidence a hostility to religion that\nno one would intend.\n\n       This is a difficult and close case, complicated by the fact\nthat, unlike the vast majority of Establishment Clause cases\nwhich are brought by plaintiffs complaining of a state’s actions,\nthis case was brought by an employee of a state complaining\nabout pre-emptive action taken by the state in its attempt to\navoid an Establishment Clause problem. With this litigation\nhopefully nearing its end, one also hopes that those involved\n\n\n       34\n         One wonders how a court can dictate, beyond a certain\npoint, what response is permissible, much less how a response\nwould be enforced. Defendants told the District Court that\nBorden can bow his head, but he cannot do “a pronounced\nbowing of the head.” What is “pronounced,” and who would\ndecide that question? As defendants also told the District Court,\n“The district does not have thought police, and we certainly\ndon’t have bow police.”\n\n                               69\n\fwill move forward as a team for the benefit of the young people\nwho look to them for guidance and support.\n\n\n\n\n                              70\n\f</pre>",
