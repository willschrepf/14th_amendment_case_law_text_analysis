The district court dis-\nmissed Ali’s complaint for failure to allege that she suffered an\nadverse employment action.

We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n   We accept the well-pleaded facts in Ali’s complaint and recite\nthem in the light most favorable to her. See Brooks v. City of Winston-\nSalem, 85 F.3d 178, 181 (4th Cir. 1996). In August 1996 Alamo hired\nAli as a management trainee. While on the job, she wore a head scarf\nalong with her company uniform. She wore the head scarf in accor-\ndance with her Islamic religious beliefs. In December 1996 H. Scott\nCooper became Ali’s new supervisor. Cooper told Ali that she would\nhave to stop wearing the head scarf or be transferred to a position in\n\f                        ALI v. ALAMO RENT-A-CAR                          3\nwhich she would not be in frequent contact with customers. Ali\nrefused to stop wearing a scarf, and Cooper transferred her.1\n\n   Ali sued Alamo, claiming that Alamo’s refusal to allow her to wear\na head scarf was employment discrimination in violation of Title VII.\nThe district court dismissed Ali’s complaint for failure to allege an\nadverse employment action. The court gave Ali eleven days to refile\na complaint alleging such action. Ali concluded that she could not\nmeet this circuit’s standard for an adverse employment action. There-\nfore, instead of refiling the complaint, Ali filed a motion to amend the\njudgment, arguing that Title VII religious discrimination claims do\nnot require a showing of adverse employment action. The court\ndenied the motion and Ali now appeals.\n\n                                    II.\n\n   We review de novo the trial court’s dismissal of Ali’s complaint.\nSee Chisolm v. Transouth Fin. Corp., 95 F.3d 331, 334 (4th Cir.\n1996). Ali claims that Alamo’s refusal to allow her to wear a head\nscarf was in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). That section pro-\nvides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\n      otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect\n      to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n      employment, because of such individual’s race, color, reli-\n      gion, sex, or national origin; or\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or appli-\n      cants for employment in any way which would deprive or\n      tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities\n      or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n      national origin.\n  1\n   Alamo subsequently terminated Ali as part of a reduction in force.\nShe concedes that her termination was lawful and unrelated to the events\nthat form the basis for this suit.\n\f4                      ALI v. ALAMO RENT-A-CAR\n§ 2000e-2(a). Under this section an employee who claims that she\nfaced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin\nmust show that she suffered some type of adverse employment action.\nSee, e.g., Clearwater v. Indep. Sch. Dist. #166, 231 F.3d 1122, 1127\n(8th Cir. 2000) (race); Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., 225\nF.3d 1115, 1125 (9th Cir. 2000) (national origin); Boone v. Goldin,\n178 F.3d 253, 256 (4th Cir. 1999) (sex). The adverse employment\naction requirement is derived from the statute’s requirement that the\nemployer’s practice relate to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment\" or that the practice \"deprive any individual\nof employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status\nas an employee.\" § 2000e-2(a)(1) & (2). Ali concedes that she did not\nsuffer any legally cognizable adverse employment action.2 She\nclaims, however, that Title VII religious discrimination claims do not\nrequire a showing of adverse employment action. In Chalmers v.\nTulon Co., 101 F.3d 1012, 1019 (4th Cir. 1996), we said that a plain-\ntiff in a Title VII religious discrimination case must show adverse\nemployment action. Ali argues that Chalmers is not controlling\nbecause the question of whether adverse employment action is\nrequired was not squarely presented. In Chalmers the plaintiff had\nbeen fired and therefore satisfied the requirement. See id. at 1017. Ali,\ntherefore, argues that Chalmers’s discussion of the adverse employ-\nment action requirement is dicta. We need not decide whether Chal-\nmers is controlling because Title VII religious discrimination claims\nclearly require a showing of adverse employment action.\n\n   Section 2000(e)-2(a) joins religion with race, color, sex, and\nnational origin in the same sentence. Because race, color, sex, and\nnational origin require a showing of adverse employment action, Ali\nbears the burden of showing why religion should be treated differ-\nently. Ali argues that (1) the statutory definition of \"religion,\" (2) leg-\nislative history, (3) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) regulations, (4) and case law all support the fact that religion,\nunlike the other bases for discrimination, does not require a showing\nof adverse employment action. We take up each of Ali’s arguments\nin turn.\n    2\n   Because Ali concedes that she did not suffer any adverse employment\naction, we are not required to consider what actually constitutes adverse\nemployment action under Title VII.\n\f                       ALI v. ALAMO RENT-A-CAR                          5\n   Ali claims that the accommodation provision in the statutory defi-\nnition of \"religion\" dictates that religion should be treated differently.\n\"Religion\" is defined as including \"all aspects of religious observance\nand practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that\nhe is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s . . . reli-\ngious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct\nof the employer’s business.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). Congress inserted\nthe accommodation provision in the definition of religion in the wake\nof Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F.2d 324, 330 (6th Cir. 1970),\naff’d by an equally divided court, 402 U.S. 689 (1971). In Dewey the\ncircuit court held that an employer does not discriminate on the basis\nof religion simply by failing to accommodate an employee’s religious\npractice. In light of Dewey the accommodation provision is best seen\nas clarifying that an employer does discriminate on the basis of reli-\ngion if it can accommodate the religious practice without undue hard-\nship. However, the accommodation provision does not affect the\nstatute’s underlying requirement that the employer’s discriminatory\npractice relate to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment\" or that the practice \"deprive any individual or employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee.\" § 2000e-2(a)(1) & (2). In other words, the accommoda-\ntion provision does not affect the basic statutory requirement for\nadverse employment action. As with sex, race, color, and national ori-\ngin, a plaintiff claiming religious discrimination under Title VII must\nshow adverse employment action. Title VII only prohibits employer\npractices where the employer discriminates on the basis of religion\nand the employee suffers an adverse employment action. Therefore,\nAli’s reliance upon the accommodation provision in the definition of\nreligion is misplaced.\n\n   Ali also relies upon the legislative history accompanying the adop-\ntion of the accommodation provision in an attempt to show that reli-\ngious discrimination claims do not require a showing of adverse\nemployment action. Ali cites to the history in which Congress\nexpressed concern with the Dewey decision. See, e.g., 118 Cong. Rec.\n706 (1972) (statement by Sen. Randolph). Again, in Dewey the circuit\ncourt held that an employer does not discriminate on the basis of reli-\ngion simply by failing to accommodate an employee’s religious prac-\ntice. We do not question that Congress adopted the accommodation\nprovision in response to the Dewey decision. However, as discussed\n\f6                     ALI v. ALAMO RENT-A-CAR\nabove, Congress’s concern about the Dewey decision is not inconsis-\ntent with Title VII’s requirement for adverse employment action.\nTherefore, the legislative history does not show that Congress\nintended to allow an employee to recover for religious discrimination\nunder Title VII without showing an adverse employment action.\n\n   Ali also cites to the EEOC regulations implementing Title VII with\nrespect to religious accommodation. The regulations, however, simply\ntrack the language of the accommodation provision in the statutory\ndefinition of religion. See 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2. The regulations do not\naddress whether an adverse employment action is required.\n\n   Finally, Ali argues that a few cases stand for the proposition that\na showing of adverse employment action is not required in Title VII\nreligious discrimination cases. However, none of the cases she cites\nstand for, or even suggest, such a proposition. For example, Ali relies\nupon Rodriguez v. City of Chicago, 156 F.3d 771 (7th Cir. 1998). In\nRodriguez the plaintiff police officer, who was Catholic, objected to\nbeing assigned to guard abortion clinics. The officer was employed\nthroughout the litigation. Because the officer remained employed, Ali\nargues that Rodriguez held that a showing of adverse employment\naction is not required. However, Rodriguez rejected the plaintiff’s\nclaim on an alternative ground without ever reaching the question of\nwhether a showing of adverse employment action is required. See id.\nat 776. Rodriguez, therefore, is of no help to Ali.\n\n   In conclusion, a Title VII plaintiff claiming discrimination on the\nbasis of religion must allege adverse employment action in order to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The judgment of the\ndistrict court is therefore\n\n                                                         AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Reynolds Metals Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291225\"><a href=\"/opinion/291225/robert-kenneth-dewey-v-reynolds-metals-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (6th Cir. 1970),\naff’d by an equally divided court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108352\"><a href=\"/opinion/108352/dewey-v-reynolds-metals-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). In Dewey the\ncircuit court held that an employer does not discriminate on the basis\nof religion simply by failing to accommodate an employee’s religious\npractice. In light of Dewey the accommodation provision is best seen\nas clarifying that an employer does discriminate on the basis of reli-\ngion if it can accommodate the religious practice without undue hard-\nship. However, the accommodation provision does not affect the\nstatute’s underlying requirement that the employer’s discriminatory\npractice relate to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment\" or that the practice \"deprive any individual or employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee.\" § 2000e-2(a)(1) & (2). In other words, the accommoda-\ntion provision does not affect the basic statutory requirement for\nadverse employment action. As with sex, race, color, and national ori-\ngin, a plaintiff claiming religious discrimination under Title VII must\nshow adverse employment action. Title VII only prohibits employer\npractices where the employer discriminates on the basis of religion\nand the employee suffers an adverse employment action. Therefore,\nAli’s reliance upon the accommodation provision in the definition of\nreligion is misplaced.\n\n   Ali also relies upon the legislative history accompanying the adop-\ntion of the accommodation provision in an attempt to show that reli-\ngious discrimination claims do not require a showing of adverse\nemployment action. Ali cites to the history in which Congress\nexpressed concern with the Dewey decision. See, e.g., 118 Cong. Rec.\n706 (1972) (statement by Sen. Randolph). Again, in Dewey the circuit\ncourt held that an employer does not discriminate on the basis of reli-\ngion simply by failing to accommodate an employee’s religious prac-\ntice. We do not question that Congress adopted the accommodation\nprovision in response to the Dewey decision. However, as discussed\n\f6                     ALI v. ALAMO RENT-A-CAR\nabove, Congress’s concern about the Dewey decision is not inconsis-\ntent with Title VII’s requirement for adverse employment action.\nTherefore, the legislative history does not show that Congress\nintended to allow an employee to recover for religious discrimination\nunder Title VII without showing an adverse employment action.\n\n   Ali also cites to the EEOC regulations implementing Title VII with\nrespect to religious accommodation. The regulations, however, simply\ntrack the language of the accommodation provision in the statutory\ndefinition of religion. See 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2. The regulations do not\naddress whether an adverse employment action is required.\n\n   Finally, Ali argues that a few cases stand for the proposition that\na showing of adverse employment action is not required in Title VII\nreligious discrimination cases. However, none of the cases she cites\nstand for, or even suggest, such a proposition. For example, Ali relies\nupon Rodriguez v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758072\"><a href=\"/opinion/758072/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1421-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45507-angelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1998). In\nRodriguez the plaintiff police officer, who was Catholic, objected to\nbeing assigned to guard abortion clinics. The officer was employed\nthroughout the litigation. Because the officer remained employed, Ali\nargues that Rodriguez held that a showing of adverse employment\naction is not required. However, Rodriguez rejected the plaintiff’s\nclaim on an alternative ground without ever reaching the question of\nwhether a showing of adverse employment action is required. See id.\nat 776. Rodriguez, therefore, is of no help to Ali.\n\n   In conclusion, a Title VII plaintiff claiming discrimination on the\nbasis of religion must allege adverse employment action in order to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The judgment of the\ndistrict court is therefore\n\n                                                         AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
