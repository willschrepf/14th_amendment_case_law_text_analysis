In 1932 these lines filed the action herein before the Public Utilities Commission, urging two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 517</span> \nthings: First, that the rate of 1926 was never legally inaugurated because there had been no compliance with I. C. A., sec 59-622, and that I. C. A., sec. 59-623, did not apply because of what is contended is the correct though substituted language of the latter section, and second, that the rate of 75 cents was unreasonable, unjust and excessive.</p>\n<p>Several hearings were had by the Commission and the rate ultimately reduced to $4 per year, from which decision appellants seek relief, mainly on the ground that the Commission failed to find the value of appellants' property used and useful in rendering this service involved as a rate base. Respondents' position is that the service rendered involves no additional equipment and is a mere overflow service.</p>\n<p>These rural lines and all of their equipment up to the city limits or up to the central telephone exchanges are owned by respondents. The equipment, however, within the central exchange stations is owned and operated by appellant and at least the connections of respondents' lines with the central exchange consist of equipment which would not be needed if this service were not rendered. We do not mean to indicate that other portions of the plant and equipment are not necessary in such use. It is quite generally held and so recognized by the Commission and this court that the two main elements entering into the fixing of reasonable rates are, first, cost to the utility rendering the service on an economical and efficient basis, and a rate that will bring a fair return to the utility rendering the service, on its property used and useful in such service, and second, what rate will be a fair one to the consumer; such harmonizing of the two sometimes rendering necessary a compromise between them.

Public</em><em>Utilities Com., supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>By the Constitution of Idaho, article 5, section 9, the legislature is given authority to fix the scope of appeal, now directly thereby provided for, from the Commission to the court, and by I. C. A., sec. 59-629, the court is limited to a determination of whether the Commission regularly pursued its authority. (<em>Boise Artesian Water Co. v.

This presupposes, however, and necessitates findings of fact by the Commission upon the ultimate facts necessary to be found to support the conclusions of the Commission, which in this case would be the fixing of a reasonable and just rate.</p>\n<p>Evidence was introduced bearing upon the valuation of the property of appellant and respondents, used in this service. The evidence further showed that toll calls were carried over both systems and that respondent collected and paid to appellant all prepaid calls originating on respondents' lines and all collect, incoming, long distance calls, but that no division had ever been made by appellant to respondent for respondents' services in such connection. The Commission should have found the valuation of the respective properties both of appellant and respondent, used in connection with the service rendered by appellant to respondents for the exchange service, and have considered in connection therewith the respective services in connection with long distance calls, not in respect to what are reasonable charges for long distance calls, but as bearing on what is a reasonable rate to be charged by appellant for the exchange service involved herein.</p>\n<p>The cause must therefore be reversed for the Commission to make such valuation and determine what is a reasonable rate, based upon what is a fair return to appellant, reasonable and economic cost of such service, considering also what respondents can reasonably afford to pay for such service, the burden of proof to establish any increase over the 50 cent rate being on the appellant.

A., secs. 59-622 and 59-623, upon their face are in conflict with each other, inconsistent and contradictory. Respondent contends that this inconsistency and contradiction is removed if the word \"not\" is read into the fourth line of section 59-623 before the word \"increasing,\" and that the word \"not\" was in all statutes having almost the identical wording of our section adopted at about the same time by other adjacent states. If I. C. A., sec. 59-623, be given effect as it now reads, section 59-622 is really entirely superfluous and would be of no effect; if, however, the word \"not\" be read in as contended by respondents, the two sections are harmonious, sec. 59-622 dealing with increased rates and sec. 59-623 dealing with new but not increased rates. While courts may not legislate or substitute their opinion or judgment for that of the legislature, where it is clear that words have been inadvertently or mistakenly used, or omitted, the court may and will determine the true and proper meaning of the legislative act (<em>People v.

The Commission should have found the valuation of the respective properties both of appellant and respondent, used in connection with the service rendered by appellant to respondents for the exchange service, and have considered in connection therewith the respective services in connection with long distance calls, not in respect to what are reasonable charges for long distance calls, but as bearing on what is a reasonable rate to be charged by appellant for the exchange service involved herein.</p>\n<p>The cause must therefore be reversed for the Commission to make such valuation and determine what is a reasonable rate, based upon what is a fair return to appellant, reasonable and economic cost of such service, considering also what respondents can reasonably afford to pay for such service, the burden of proof to establish any increase over the 50 cent rate being on the appellant.

Respondent contends that this inconsistency and contradiction is removed if the word \"not\" is read into the fourth line of section 59-623 before the word \"increasing,\" and that the word \"not\" was in all statutes having almost the identical wording of our section adopted at about the same time by other adjacent states. If I. C. A., sec. 59-623, be given effect as it now reads, section 59-622 is really entirely superfluous and would be of no effect; if, however, the word \"not\" be read in as contended by respondents, the two sections are harmonious, sec. 59-622 dealing with increased rates and sec. 59-623 dealing with new but not increased rates.

Lund and Richards  Haga, for Appellant.\n\nThe order fixing a $4 rate per annum per phone is arbitrary, unreasonable and unjust, and without the issues as announced and defined by the Commission during the progress of the hearing, and is contrary to the evidence. ( Ann Arbor R. Co. v.  United States ,  281 U.S. 658 ,  50 Sup. Ct. 444 ,  74 L. ed. 1098 ; Southern Pac. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Com. ,  219 U.S. 433 , 31 Sup.

Farmers' Loan  Trust Co. ,  154 U.S. 362 , 14 Sup. Ct. 1047 ,  38 L. ed. 1014 .)\n\nBert H. Miller, Attorney General, J.W. Taylor, Assistant Attorney General, and Hawkins,  Hawkins, for Respondents.\n\nThe Public Utilities Commission, in making classification of service and consumers, and in fixing rates, should take into consideration only such property, equipment, investment and expense as are affected or concerned in the matters under consideration, and as are necessary to arrive at a\nfair and just decision. ( Covington  Lexington Turnpike Co. v.  Sandford ,  164 U.S. 578 ,  17 Sup. Ct. 198 ,  41 L. ed. 560 ; 10 C. J 418.)\n\nEven if this court should hold that the said rate of $4 per annum per phone is not justified, the said Order No. 910, fixing the rate for locally owned lines at 50 cents per month per phone would be in full force and effect, since lawful means were never taken to change it. (I. C. A., sec. 59-622.)\n\nThere is a wide distinction between interpretation and review of validity, and upon the theory of ascertainment of legislative intent for interpretation, it is proper to review not only the history and title of the act, but contemporary history, the original bill, matters of common knowledge, the purposes motivating enactment of the law, and the object to be accomplished.

J.), 37 Nev. 245 ,  141 P. 988  (990).)\n\nTo make a legislative intent operative, it is proper to strike out even whole clauses inconsistent therewith or to interpolate omitted words. ( Lamkin v. Sterling ,  1 Idaho 92 ; Pioneer Irr. Dist. v. Bradley ,  8 Idaho 310 ,  68 P. 295 , 101 Am. St. 201.)",
