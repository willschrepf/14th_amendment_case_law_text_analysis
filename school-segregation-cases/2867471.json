Sempier now appeals the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment on his Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct (ADEA) claim, 29 U.S.C. ยง 263 (1988),1 and the discretionary\n\ndismissal of his pendent state law claims.     He also raises as\n\nerror the district court's substitution of a \"Bill of\n\nParticulars\" in place of his interrogatories.\n\n\n\n1\n.   29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a) in relevant part provides:\n\n          It shall be unlawful for an employer--\n               (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n          individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n          individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n          conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\n          such individual's age;\n               (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n          in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n          individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n          adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n          such individual's age . . . .\n\f          We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 to\n\nreview the March 9, 1994 final order of the district court.\n\nBecause the record reflects a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding whether J & H's asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\ndischarging Sempier are pretextual, we will reverse the summary\n\njudgment entered in favor of J & H.   We also conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in substituting its own\n\n\"Bill of Particulars\" for Sempier's interrogatories.\n\n\n\n                                I\n\n          Sempier joined appellee J & H, an insurance brokerage\n\nand employee benefits consulting firm, in 1968.2   Sempier worked\n\nas Comptroller until 1971 when he became Treasurer of J & H.      In\n\n1984, J & H created a new position of Chief Financial Officer\n\n(\"CFO\"), and the Board of Directors elected Sempier to that post.\n\n          The parties dispute whether the J & H directors\n\ncriticized Sempier's performance as CFO.    Sempier avers that no\n\none advised him that his performance was less than satisfactory\n\nnor did anyone bring to his attention any deficiencies in his\n\nperformance of his functions.   App. 300.   Robert Hatcher, the\n\nfirm's chairman who was Sempier's friend and had been\n\ninstrumental in Sempier being elected as CFO, states that he was\n\ngenerally pleased with Sempier's work.   At the same time, he\n\nacknowledges that other directors had criticized Sempier's\n\n2\n . J & H is a closely held New Jersey corporation. It operates\nas if it were a partnership. All stockholders are members of the\nfirm. All directors are employees of the firm.\n\fperformance.    App. 363-65.    Other J & H directors state in\n\naffidavits that they believed that Sempier performed below\n\nexpectations.    App. 727 (affidavit of Eric Johnson); App. 778-79\n\n(affidavit of Kenneth Hecken).\n\n           In 1985, one year after Sempier assumed his duties as\n\nCFO, an outside audit of the Finance Department, requested by\n\nJ & H director Eric Johnson, criticized the department's\n\noperations.    App. 728-29.    After further investigation, Johnson\n\nsought to have Sempier replaced.      Despite Johnson's criticisms,\n\nJ & H unanimously elected Sempier to the Board of Directors in\n\n1986.   Hatcher supported Sempier's election to the Board of\n\nDirectors because he believed that this move would assist Sempier\n\nin improving the Finance Department's operations.      When Sempier\n\nwas elected, J & H required that he execute a letter of\n\nresignation that would become effective upon a two-thirds vote of\n\nthe Board of Directors.\n\n           In May 1987, J & H removed Sempier from his\n\nresponsibilities as CFO and made him Chief Administrative Officer\n\n(\"CAO\") in charge of Management Information Systems (\"MIS\"),\n\nHuman Resources, Professional Development, and Real Estate and\n\nFacilities.    Sempier was unanimously reelected to the Board in\n\n1989.   Both sides dispute how Sempier performed as CAO.\n\n           Due to the increasing importance of MIS services and\n\nthe department's unsatisfactory record, J & H decided to elevate\n\nthe MIS department's status by hiring a Chief Information Officer\n\n(\"CIO\"), thereby removing MIS from Sempier's supervision.\n\nNotwithstanding some lobbying by Hatcher, the firm denied Sempier\n\fthe CIO position.    In December 1989, J & H hired Alan Page, who\n\nis fourteen years younger than Sempier, as CIO.     The directors\n\nelected Page to the board in 1990.\n\n           Three months later, J & H hired Thomas Carpenter, who\n\nis four years younger than Sempier, to assume responsibility for\n\nHuman Resources and Professional Development, starting in May\n\n1990.   Carpenter's arrival left Sempier with significantly\n\nreduced responsibilities.\n\n           In May 1989, before either Page or Carpenter had been\n\nhired, J & H had instituted an early retirement program to retire\n\n\"redundant\" and \"poorly performing\" employees who were 55 years\n\nof age or older.    App. 636-37.   The firm intended to use the\n\nprogram either to \"pull\" employees into retirement through\n\nincentives or to \"push\" them into retirement through involuntary\n\n\"terminations\" which were to be characterized as downsizing.\n\nApp. 637 (Exhibit 8).\n\n           In April 1990, Hatcher, who was still the Chairman of\n\nJ & H, advised Sempier to retire early with certain enhancements\n\nto his existing retirement package.     Hatcher stated that Sempier\n\nhad \"lost credibility\" with unnamed senior managers.     App. 301.\n\nSempier refused to retire.    Hatcher responded, using strong and\n\nunequivocal language, that Sempier had no choice but to retire or\n\nto be forced out.    App. 302.\n\n           Between April 1990 and April 1991, J & H engaged in\n\nextended, and occasionally bitter, negotiations with Sempier\n\nseeking to obtain his retirement or resignation.     In January\n\n1991, David Olsen succeeded Hatcher as Chairman of J & H.     When,\n\fin the spring of 1991, Sempier told Olsen that he had hired a\n\nlawyer, Olsen told Sempier that he could no longer return to\n\nJ & H and should vacate his office.     App. 81.   At the same time,\n\nOlsen wrote the firm's general counsel that \"[i]t's obviously\n\ntime for hardball.\"   App. 80.   After Sempier consistently refused\n\nto retire, the Board made effective Sempier's previously executed\n\nresignation in June 1991.\n\n           Sempier filed an age discrimination claim with the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, received a right to sue\n\nletter, and instituted an ADEA suit in the District of New Jersey\n\nwith pendent state law claims for   breach of contract as well as\n\nviolations of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and the\n\nNew Jersey Business Corporations Act.    J & H answered that\n\nSempier had been discharged for poor performance.\n\n           At the outset of the litigation, Sempier served two\n\nsets of interrogatories and a series of document requests on\n\nJ & H.    When J & H refused to respond to a substantial portion of\n\nthe discovery requested, Sempier sought an order from the\n\nmagistrate judge which would have compelled J & H to respond.\n\nThe magistrate judge denied Sempier's motion.      On appeal, the\n\ndistrict court judge vacated the order of denial but remanded the\n\ndispute to the magistrate judge without entering an order\n\ncompelling discovery.   On remand, the magistrate judge relieved\n\nJ & H from answering the original two sets of interrogatories and\n\nrequired that Sempier draft a third set of interrogatories.         App.\n\n563-64.   After J & H refused to answer almost all of these\n\ninterrogatories, Sempier again sought a second order compelling\n\fdiscovery.   The magistrate judge denied Sempier's motion to\n\ncompel answers and ordered J & H to provide information\n\nresponding to a \"Bill of Particulars\" drafted by the court.    App.\n\n576.   On appeal, the district court affirmed the magistrate\n\njudge's order and added one question of its own to the \"Bill of\n\nParticulars.\"\n\n           Between November and December 1993, the parties\n\ndisputed whether J & H had complied with the court's orders to\n\nanswer the court's questions and to provide documents.    In\n\nDecember, Sempier filed additional motions for an order to compel\n\ndiscovery and for partial summary judgment.   J & H replied with\n\nits motion for summary judgment.\n\n           The district court granted J & H's summary judgment\n\nmotion on the ADEA claim and dismissed the remaining pendent\n\nclaims without prejudice.   The district court expressed concern\n\nthat Sempier had not made out a prima facie case because of an\n\ninability to show that he was a qualified employee or replaced by\n\na sufficiently younger employee to raise an inference of age\n\ndiscrimination.   Nonetheless, it turned to J & H's asserted\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for Sempier's discharge and Sempier's\n\nevidence of pretext.\n\n           The district court found that J & H had come forward\n\nwith two alleged reasons for Sempier's discharge: (1) that\n\nSempier's reduced responsibilities did not justify his continued\n\npresence on the Board of Directors and (2) that Sempier's poor\n\nperformance had justified the reduction in his responsibilities\n\nand eventual discharge.   Moreover, the district court held that\n\fSempier had not produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to\n\nfind that J & H's alleged nondiscriminatory reasons were a\n\npretext for discrimination.    Accordingly, the court entered a\n\njudgment in favor of J & H, denied Sempier's motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment, and dismissed Sempier's pendent state law\n\nclaims without prejudice.\n\n          Sempier filed a timely appeal.\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n                                  A.\n\n             When we review a grant of summary judgment, we apply\n\nthe same test that the district court should have applied\n\ninitially.    Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 814 F.2d 893, 896\n\n(3d Cir.) (en banc), cert. dism'd, 483 U.S. 1052 (1987).     Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only when the admissible evidence fails\n\nto demonstrate a dispute of material fact and the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.    Id.; see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nProc. 56(c) (1994).    When the moving party (here, J & H) does not\n\nbear the burden of persuasion at trial, the moving party may meet\n\nits burden on summary judgment by showing that the nonmoving\n\nparty's (here, Sempier's) evidence is insufficient to carry its\n\nburden of persuasion at trial.    Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 323-24 (1986).     Thereafter, the nonmoving party creates\n\na genuine issue of material fact if sufficient evidence is\n\nprovided to allow a reasonable jury to find for him at trial.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477     U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\n\f          In reviewing the record, the court must give the\n\nnonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences.     Josey\n\nv. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 637 (3d Cir. 1993);\n\nGray v. York Newspapers, Inc., 957 F.2d 1070, 1077 (3d Cir.\n\n1992); Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 900; see also id. at 901\n\n(discussing the impropriety of credibility determinations on\n\nsummary judgment); Josey, 996 F.2d at 639 (same).\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n          Sempier prosecuted his case on the \"pretext\" theory\n\nannounced in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n\n(1973) and later clarified in Texas Department of Community\n\nAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981) and St. Mary's Honor\n\nCenter v. Hicks, __ U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993).3\n\n          As applied to ADEA cases, the plaintiff establishes a\n\nprima facie case by showing that (1) he is over 40, (2) he is\n\nqualified for the position in question, (3) he suffered an\n\nadverse employment decision, and (4) he was replaced by a\n\nsufficiently younger person to create an inference of age\n\ndiscrimination.   Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 897.4   This showing\n3\n . Although the pretext framework originated in the context of\nTitle VII, it has been applied to the ADEA. See, e.g., Geary v.\nVisitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish School, 7 F.3d 324\nn.4 (3d Cir. 1993).\n4\n . Sempier's complaint appears to suggest that J & H violated\nthe ADEA not only by discharging him as an employee but also by\nremoving him as a director. For the most part, the record and\nthe parties' briefs treat these two events as functionally\nidentical. Whether the ADEA extends to cover Sempier's status as\na director is a function of Sempier's duties and not his title.\nSee Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden, 112 S. Ct. 1344,\n\fcreates a presumption of age discrimination that the employer\n\nmust rebut by stating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nthe adverse employment decision.   Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S.\n\nCt. at 2747; Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 897.   The plaintiff then has\n\nthe opportunity to demonstrate that the employer's stated reasons\n\nwere not its true reasons but were a pretext for discrimination.\n\nHicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2747; Chipollini, 814 F.2d at\n\n897.   He may do this through direct or circumstantial evidence of\n\nfalsity or discrimination.   Chauhan v. M. Alfieri Co., Inc., 897\n\nF.2d 123, 128 (3d Cir. 1990); Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 898-99.\n\n           Moreover, to defeat a summary judgment motion based on\n\na defendant's proffer of a nondiscriminatory reason, a plaintiff\n\nwho has made a prima facie showing of discrimination need only\n\npoint to evidence establishing a reasonable inference that the\n\nemployer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\n\nFuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).    A plaintiff\n\nis not required to produce evidence which necessarily leads to\n\nthe conclusion \"that the employer did not act for the\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons.\" Sorba v. Pennsylvania Drilling Co.,\n(..continued)\n1348-49 (1992) (considering the definition of employee under\nERISA); Frankel v. Bally, Inc., 987 F.2d 86, 89-91 (2d Cir. 1993)\n(considering the test for who is covered under the ADEA); Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. Zippo Manufacturing Co., 713\nF.2d 32, 36-38 (3d Cir. 1983) (same); Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission v.

To the extent that Sempier on\nremand pursues relief related to his status as a director, this\nissue should be resolved by trial on the basis of the parties'\nproof of his functions at J & H in that capacity.\n\f821 F.2d 200, 205 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1019\n\n(1988).\n\n\n\n                                III\n\n           Without holding that Sempier failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case, the district court questioned whether Sempier\n\nmade out a prima facie case of discrimination.    The district\n\ncourt doubted that Sempier had shown that he was qualified to\n\nwork as the Chief Administrative Officer of J & H and doubted\n\nthat he was replaced by a sufficiently younger employee to raise\n\nan inference of age discrimination.\n\n           We note however that the prima facie case under the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas-Burdine pretext framework is not intended to be\n\nonerous.   Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.   The prima facie case merely\n\n\"raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume\n\nthese acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not\n\nbased on the consideration of impermissible factors.\"    Furnco\n\nConstruction Co. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978).\n\f                                  A.\n\n             We determine a plaintiff's qualifications for purposes\n\nof proving a prima facie case by an objective standard.

Avdel\n\nCorp., 873 F.2d 701, 707 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S.\n\n1023 (1990).     \"[W]hile objective job qualifications should be\n\nconsidered in evaluating the plaintiff's prima facie case, the\n\nquestion of whether an employee possesses a subjective quality,\n\nsuch as leadership or management skill, is better left to\"\n\nconsideration of whether the employer's nondiscriminatory reason\n\nfor discharge is pretext.    Weldon, 896 F.2d at 798.      \"Thus, to\n\ndeny the plaintiff an opportunity to move beyond the initial\n\nstage of establishing a prima facie case because he has failed to\n\nintroduce evidence showing he possesses certain subjective\n\nqualities would improperly prevent the court from examining the\n\ncriteria to determine whether their use was mere pretext.\"       Id.\n\nat 798-99.\n\n             Here, the district court misapplied this rule when it\n\nevaluated Sempier's qualification by reference to J & H's\n\nsubjective criticism that Sempier lacked \"management oriented\"\n\nskills and leadership ability.    App. 895.   Sempier had the\n\nobjective experience and education necessary to qualify as a\n\nviable candidate for the positions he held.     He had held\n\nexecutive level positions at J & H for over twenty years.\n\n             Sempier also relied on the affidavit and depositions of\n\nHatcher, J & H's chairman.    Hatcher had testified that he had\n\nbeen satisfied with Sempier's performance.     App. 895.    In\n\fresponse to this record, the district court observed, \"[a]lthough\n\nit would be unusual for a corporation to place an unqualified\n\nindividual in an executive position, it is not unimaginable.\"\n\nApp. 896-97.   In so stating, the district court failed, as\n\nrequired on summary judgment, to consider the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to Sempier, the nonmoving party.   See Josey\n\nv. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 637 (3d Cir. 1993);\n\nGray v. York Newspapers, Inc., 957 F.2d 1070, 1077 (3d Cir.\n\n1992); Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 900.   Indeed, the district court\n\napparently inferred that Sempier was unqualified for the position\n\nhe held.\n\n           Contrary to the inference of the district court, if we\n\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to Sempier, the\n\nrecord of his twenty years employment as an executive, his record\n\nas Comptroller and then Treasurer of J & H, his election to the\n\nBoard on two occasions, and his appointment as Chief Financial\n\nOfficer and then as Chief Administrative Officer leads to the\n\nalmost inevitable inference that he was qualified for the\n\nposition from which he was discharged.   As we have said in a\n\nsimilar context, \"[t]hus, [plaintiff's] satisfactory performance\n\nof duties over a long period of time leading to a promotion\n\nclearly established his qualifications for the job.\"    Jalil, 873\nF.2d at 707.   Sempier's qualifications therefore satisfy the\n\nsecond prong of the prima facie case that Sempier was charged\n\nwith establishing, thus putting to rest the doubts raised by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\f                                 B.\n\n            To complete his prima facie case, Sempier does not need\n\nto produce compelling evidence or conclusive proof that J & H's\n\nadverse employment decision resulted from age discrimination.\n\nChipollini, 814 F.2d at 900.    Rather he may point to a sufficient\n\nage difference between himself and his replacement such that a\n\nfact-finder can reasonably conclude that the employment decision\n\nwas made on the basis of age.   Maxfield v. Sinclair Intern'l, 766\n\nF.2d 788, 792 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1057 (1985).      Nor\n\nis there any particular age difference that must be shown.     Id.\n\nDifferent courts have held, for instance, that a five year\n\ndifference can be sufficient, Douglas v. Anderson, 656 F.2d 528,\n\n533 (9th Cir. 1981), but that a one year difference cannot.\n\nGray, 957 F.2d at 1087.\n\n            The district court in this case considered only the\n\nfour year age difference between Sempier and Carpenter, who had\n\ntaken over some of Sempier's responsibilities.    However, we are\n\nnot limited to considering only Sempier's final replacement.\n\nFour months prior to the date that Carpenter became responsible\n\nfor Human Resources and Professional Development at J & H, a\n\nsubstantial portion of Sempier's other functions were transferred\n\nto Alan Page.    Page is well over ten years younger than Sempier.\n\nApp. 711.    The combined differences in age between Sempier on the\n\none hand and Page and Carpenter on the other is clearly\n\fsufficient to satisfy the fourth prong of a prima facie case by\n\nraising an inference of age discrimination.5\n\n\n\n                               IV\n\n                               A.\n\n          Having concluded that the record is more than\n\nsufficient to dispel the district court's doubts as to Sempier's\n\nprima facie case, we turn now to consider the evidence of J & H's\n\nalleged reasons for Sempier's discharge.   As we earlier stated,\n\nafter the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the\n\n\n5\n . J & H contends that we cannot consider the transfer of\nSempier's duties to Page because it occurred outside of the 300\nday period for filing a separate claim of age discrimination.\nJ & H's Brief at 38; see 29 U.S.C. ยง 626(d) (providing a 300 day\nperiod in which to file an administrative charge).\n\n          The argument is disingenuous. J & H relies on the\nincremental removal of Sempier's management responsibility over\nManagement Information Systems to justify Sempier's dismissal;\nhowever, J & H asks us to limit our consideration of Sempier's\ncase to the facts that fall within the 300 days immediately prior\nto when Sempier filed his administrative charge. Although\nCarpenter was the last person to assume any of Sempier's\nresponsibilities, the process that led to Sempier's eventual\ndischarge began with the transfer of MIS authority from Sempier\nto Page.\n\n          The statute of limitations for filing a charge of\ndiscrimination may have barred our consideration of the transfer\nof MIS authority to Page if that was Sempier's cause of action,\nbut it does not prevent us from considering that event in order\nto determine whether Sempier has raised an inference of age\ndiscrimination as a part of his prima facie case. See United\nAirlines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977) (barring a\nseparate claim of discrimination, but permitting use of the prior\nevents as evidence to prove a case of discrimination based on a\nseparate claim); Colgan v. Fisher Scientific Co., 935 F.2d 1407,\n1420-21 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 379 (1991).\n\femployer must produce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason to\n\nrebut the presumption of discrimination created by the prima\n\nfacie case.   Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2747;\n\nChipollini, 814 F.2d at 897.\n\n          Here, J & H has presented two reasons.     First, J & H\n\nstates that it terminated Sempier because his company duties no\n\nlonger justified retaining him in his position.     Second, it\n\ncontends that Sempier performed those duties poorly.     J & H\n\nattempted to establish each of these justifications through\n\naffidavits of J & H executives and directors.      As we understand\n\nthe record, J & H's nondiscriminatory reasons for Sempier's\n\ndischarge come down to this:     Sempier performed so poorly that\n\nalmost all of his responsibilities at the firm were transferred\n\nto others, leading ultimately to Sempier's discharge.\n\n          J & H produced the affidavits of two directors, who had\n\npreviously supervised Sempier, reflecting the directors'\n\ndiscontent with Sempier's work.     App. 778-79, 783-84 (affidavit\n\nof Hecken); App. 726-32 (affidavit of Johnson).     Additionally,\n\nHatcher's affidavit averred that many directors did not regard\n\nSempier highly and that Hatcher had used his influence to have\n\nSempier elected to the Board against the other directors' wishes.\n\nApp. 365, 369-70.      To corroborate these assertions, J & H\n\nincluded a consultant's report that criticized the operations of\n\nthe finance department during 1985-1987 when Sempier served as\n\nCFO.   App. 738-749.    Finally, the company produced documents\n\ndisclosing that Sempier received less compensation from the\n\fdirectors' merit compensation pool than some of the other\n\ndirectors who held comparable positions.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n           On the other hand, Sempier claims that these\n\nallegations of poor performance are not worthy of credence and\n\nare no more than a pretext for discrimination.    The Supreme\n\nCourt, in Saint Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, __ U.S. __, 113 S.\n\nCt. 2742 (1993), recently clarified the showing of pretext that a\n\nplaintiff must make to win a discrimination case.    Rejection of\n\nthe employer's nondiscriminatory explanation does not compel a\n\nverdict in favor of the employee, but it permits the trier of\n\nfact to infer discrimination and find for the plaintiff on the\n\nbasis of the allegations of discrimination in his prima facie\n\ncase.   Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2749; Fuentes v.\n\nPerskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994); Seman v. Coplay Cement\n\nCo., 26 F.3d 428, 433 (3d Cir. 1994).   \"The factfinder's\n\ndisbelief of the reasons put forward by the [employer] . . . may,\n\ntogether with the elements of the [employee's] prima facie case,\n\nsuffice to show intentional discrimination.\"     Hicks, __ U.S. at\n__; 113 S. Ct. at 2749.\n\n           Accordingly, \"a plaintiff who has made out a prima\n\nfacie case may defeat a motion for summary judgment by either (i)\n\ndiscrediting the proffered reasons, either circumstantially or\n\ndirectly, or (ii) adducing evidence, whether circumstantial or\n\ndirect, that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating\n\nor determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\"\n\fFuentes, 32 F.3d at 764 (emphasis in original).    If the plaintiff\n\nproduces sufficient evidence of pretext, he need not produce\n\nadditional evidence of discrimination beyond his prima facie case\n\nto proceed to trial.   Id.\n\n          Pretext is not demonstrated by showing simply that the\n\nemployer was mistaken.   Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-\n\nCohen, 983 F.2d 509, 531 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct.\n\n88 (1993).   Instead the record is examined for evidence of\n\ninconsistencies or anomalies that could support an inference that\n\nthe employer did not act for its stated reasons.    Josey v. John\n\nR. Hollinsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 638 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n          Thus, we turn to the record to determine whether\n\nSempier has produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find\n\nthat J & H did not terminate him for poor performance.     Sempier\n\nemphasizes three evidentiary threads which create a genuine issue\n\nof material fact.   He first points to statements in his own\n\naffidavit, in Hatcher's affidavit, and in Hatcher's deposition\n\ntestimony that his performance was satisfactory.    App. 321, 325\n\n(Sempier); App. 363-65 (Hatcher); App. 797 (Hatcher).    The\n\ndistrict court found that Hatcher's additional statement that\n\nother directors did not agree with Hatcher's favorable assessment\n\nundermined the credibility of Hatcher's assertions of\n\nsatisfactory performance.    While we may or may not find Sempier's\n\nself evaluation and Hatcher's assessments of Sempier's\n\nperformance to be compelling evaluations of Sempier's work, it is\n\nneither our role nor the district court's role on summary\n\njudgment to compare the testimony of various affiants and decide\n\fwho is credible.    Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 901; Josey, 996 F.2d at\n\n637.\n\n          The district court, citing Billet v. CIGNA Corp., 940\n\nF.2d 812 (3d Cir. 1991), also concluded that Sempier's self\n\nevaluation was meaningless because only J & H's evaluation of\n\nSempier's performance was at issue.   Billet states that the\n\ninquiry into pretext centers upon the employer's beliefs and not\n\nthe employee's own perceptions.    Id. at 825 (\"However,\n\n[plaintiff's] view of his performance is not at issue; what\n\nmatters is the perception of the decision maker.\").   Nonetheless,\n\nBillet does not stand for the proposition that the employee's\n\nbelief that his performance was satisfactory is never relevant.\n\nBillet concluded that the employee's assertions of his own good\n\nperformance were insufficient to prevent summary judgment where\n\nthe employer produced performance reviews and other documentary\n\nevidence of misconduct and insubordination that demonstrated poor\n\nperformance.   Id. at 818-22.\n\n          Where, as here, Sempier asserts not only that he\n\nperformed well but that he never received any unfavorable\n\ncriticism that his performance was poor or inadequate, the jury\n\ncould conclude that J & H's failure to fault Sempier's\n\nperformance for the twenty years prior to the negotiations\n\nleading to his discharge makes suspect its post hoc assertions of\npoor performance.   This is especially true when J & H has failed\n\nto produce any other evidence of poor performance or make\n\nspecific allegations of Sempier's deficiencies.\n\f          Sempier next points to two formal performance\n\nevaluations from 1988 and 1989 in which Hecken, Sempier's\n\nsupervisor, wrote that Sempier's performance was satisfactory.\n\nApp. 308-19.   In considering these evaluations, the district\n\ncourt stated, solely on the basis of Hecken's affidavit, that\n\n\"[t]he evaluations were a first attempt by Defendant to open the\n\nlines of communication between lower level directors and the\n\nsenior members of the board to whom they reported.   Viewed in\n\nthis light, they are of little value in determining Plaintiff's\n\ntrue level of performance.\"   App. 906.   In so stating, the\n\ndistrict court ignored the testimony of Hatcher at his deposition\n\nthat any critical comments concerning Sempier's performance\n\nshould be recorded in the performance evaluations.   App. 799.\n\nHatcher also said that the compensation committee had previously\n\nused the evaluations in determining directors' compensation.\n\nApp. 824-26.   On summary judgment, it is not the court's role to\n\nweigh the disputed evidence and decide which is more probative.\n\n          Finally, Sempier points to the coercive early\n\nretirement program that J & H instituted shortly before it forced\n\nSempier's resignation.   J & H documents showed that the company\n\ninstituted this program to generate a significant number of\n\nretirements largely through monetary incentives.   The district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that the use of an early retirement\n\nprogram to dismiss redundant or underperforming employees is not\n\nby itself a violation of the ADEA.   See Gray v. York Newspapers,\n\n957 F.2d 1070, 1080-81 (3d Cir. 1992); Colgan v. Fisher\nScientific Co., 935 F.2d 1407, 1422 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 112\n\fS. Ct. 379 (1991).   On the other hand, an early retirement\n\nprogram designed to force employees who reach a senior age to\n\nleave or face significant pressure to resign or retire might\n\nitself create an inference of age discrimination.    Gray, 957 U.S.\n\nat 1081 (citing Henn v. National Geographic Soc'y, 819 F.2d 824,\n\n826, 828-29 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 964 (1987)).     It\n\nis impermissible to force older employees to choose between\n\nretirement or termination in an effort to eliminate older workers\n\non account of their age.\n\n          The record clearly discloses that Hatcher told Sempier\n\nin no uncertain terms that he could either retire, face\n\ncontinuing pressures to retire, or be terminated.6   The record\n\nalso reflects a mandatory policy at J & H that directors must\n\nretire at set intervals corresponding to age.   Later, after the\n\ncompany learned that Sempier had sought legal counsel, Olsen,\n\nJ & H's Chairman, told Sempier to pack his office and leave.\n\nWhile this evidence does not itself establish age discrimination,\n\na jury might reasonably determine from these events that J & H\n\noffered Sempier early retirement as an effort to remove him\n\nbecause of his age and not because of poor performance.\n\n          In cases such as the present one, the question for the\n\ncourt is whether the record \"could support an inference that the\n\nemployer did not act for non-discriminatory reasons, not whether\n\n6\n . In the April meeting at which Hatcher recommended early\nretirement, Sempier recites that Hatcher told Sempier that\nunnamed J & H managers \"would let me [Sempier] rot, would cut my\nballs off and otherwise make it unpleasant for me to stay.\" App.\n302.\n\fthe evidence necessarily leads to that conclusion that the\n\nemployer did act for discriminatory reasons.\"    Chipollini, 814\n\nF.2d at 900 (emphasis in original); see also Fuentes, 32 F.3d at\n\n764 (stating that the plaintiff need not show more than that the\n\nemployer's articulated reasons were implausible to survive\n\nsummary judgment).    When the evidence is read in the light most\n\nfavorable to Sempier, a jury could reasonably find that J & H did\n\nnot terminate him because of poor performance but rather\n\ndischarged him because of his age.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n          To recap, once Sempier had made out a prima facie case\n\nof age discrimination, a presumption arose that J & H had\n\ndiscriminated against him.     Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254.   J & H\n\ndispelled that presumption by coming forward with a\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for Sempier's discharge, leaving nothing\n\nbut the permissible inference of discrimination created by the\n\nprima facie case.     Hicks, __ U.S. at __; 113 S. Ct. at 2748-49.\n\nSempier's attack on J & H's stated reasons for his discharge\n\nleaves us with the paradigmatic case in which each party has\n\nproduced testimony and evidence that conflicts on the ultimate\n\nissue -- whether Sempier was discharged for poor performance or\n\nbecause of his age.    The resulting conflict must be resolved by a\n\njury and cannot be resolved on summary judgment.    Thus, the\n\nsummary judgment entered in favor of J & H must be reversed.7\n\n7\n . Sempier also raises as error the district court's denial of a\npartial summary judgment in his favor on the issue of liability.\n\f                                VI\n\n          In addition to challenging the district court's order\n\nwhich granted summary judgment to J & H, an order which we now\n\nhold must be reversed, Sempier also complains that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in ruling on his discovery efforts.\n\nIn so doing, Sempier contends that he was prevented from\n\nmarshalling additional evidence establishing that J & H's\n\nproffered reason for his discharge was pretextual.8\n\n          We normally do not become involved with \"nitty gritty\"\n\nrulings on discovery matters.   Nor do we generally engage in\n\nexercises to determine whether a party's interrogatories are\n\nrelevant or are unduly burdensome.   This appeal, however,\n\nrequires that we review the actions taken by the magistrate judge\n\nand the district court judge with respect to discovery sought and\n\nanswered by the parties.   While we will not examine each jot and\n\n\n\n\n(..continued)\nSempier argues that J & H presented no evidence of his poor\nperformance. As we have discussed in text, the record reflects\nthat both Sempier and J & H have adduced conflicting evidence\nover the reason for his discharge. This resulting conflict could\nnot be resolved by summary judgment in Sempier's favor.\n8\n . Sempier strongly disputes J & H's contention that he had\nchosen to resist J & H's renewed motion for summary judgment\nwithout completing the depositions that had been scheduled.\nSempier claims that the documents he sought from J & H were\nessential in order to conduct his remaining depositions. He\nasserts that the district court for that reason alone should have\ndenied J & H's motion for summary judgment and should have\npermitted Sempier to complete his discovery. (Sempier Reply\nBrief at p. 23.)\n\ftittle of the discovery process, it is important to our analysis\n\nthat some background be furnished.\n\n          Sempier's complaint was filed in April 1992.     In June\n\n1992, Sempier served his first set of interrogatories and a\n\nrequest for production of documents.   In July 1992, Sempier\n\nserved a second set of interrogatories with a second request for\n\nproduction of documents.   Unfortunately, not all of the\n\ninterrogatories that were served have found their way into the\n\nrecord, and thus, into the appendix.   We have examined those that\n\nhave been reproduced in the appendix, and we find it difficult to\n\nunderstand how the magistrate judge could have condoned the\n\nanswers given by J & H.    Moreover, we are perplexed by the\n\nfailure of the magistrate judge or the district court judge to\n\ncompel responsive answers to the interrogatories -- almost all of\n\nwhich appear to us to be relevant and directed to the issues of\n\nSempier's employment, performance and relationship with J & H.\n\n          For example, Interrogatory No. 36 sought the name of\n\neach and every person who had supervision and/or control over\n\nSempier from January 1, 1986 through the termination of Sempier's\n\nemployment.   It also sought, with respect to each such supervisor\n\nidentified, the job title, the department supervised, the duties\n\nand responsibilities of the job, the date on which he or she\n\nassumed the supervisory position, and, if the individual was not\n\nstill employed, the date and reason of termination and the last\n\nknown address.   True, that interrogatory sought as well the date\n\nof hire, date of birth and educational background, but those\n\nthree inquiries, if not deemed relevant in the district court's\n\fjudgment, could have been excised and the remainder of the\n\ninterrogatory answered.    Yet J & H objected to the interrogatory\n\non the grounds that it was \"overbroad, unduly burdensome, and\n\nexceeding the scope of permissible discovery.\"    J & H then\n\nreferred Sempier to a J & H Position Statement which does not\n\neven appear to be part of the record.\n\n          Again, Interrogatory No. 44 asked J & H if it\n\nvoluntarily terminated the employment and/or relationship of\n\nSempier with J & H.    J & H's response reads:   \"Defendant refers\n\nplaintiff to pages 3 through 17 of the J & H Position Statement.\"\n\nThe following interrogatory, Interrogatory No. 45, sought the\n\ndates on which the decision to terminate Sempier was made, and\n\nJ & H's response was \"See Interrogatory No. 44.\"     Interrogatory\n\nNo. 46 sought the factual basis for J & H's decision to terminate\n\nSempier and/or the relationship of Sempier with J & H.    The\n\nanswer given by J & H:    \"Defendant refers plaintiff to the J & H\n\nPosition Statement.\"    The other interrogatories which we have\n\nreviewed -- all seemingly relevant -- have been answered in much\n\nthe same manner.   All of J & H's answers disregard the\n\nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.     See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 33(a) (requiring separate and complete answers unless\n\nspecific objections are provided); 26(b) (defining the scope of\n\ndiscovery) (1993 version).9\n\n9\n . Lead counsel for J & H is apparently the New York law firm of\nSullivan & Cromwell. Perhaps this accounts for the lack of\nfamiliarity with New Jersey Federal Court practice. We note,\nhowever, that J & H had local counsel. It is a matter of concern\nto us that the discovery practice in this case was so badly\nabused when at the least, local counsel had to have recognized\n\f          Without dwelling further on this subject, we observe\n\nthat the magistrate judge did not compel the answers which\n\nSempier sought.   Rather, he relieved J & H from answering the\n\nvarious discovery requests and instructed Sempier to issue a\n\nthird set of interrogatories and a third document request.   The\n\nlatter two discovery requests were no more answered than the\n\nearlier ones.   In lieu of compelling answers to the third set of\n\ninterrogatories served by Sempier, the district court instructed\n\nJ & H to answer a four question \"Bill of Particulars.\"\n\n          Against this background, we consider Sempier's\n\narguments.   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and our\n\njurisprudence, district courts have broad discretion to manage\n\ndiscovery.   See, e.g., Walter v. Holiday Inns, Inc, 985 F.2d\n\n1232, 1237 n.4 (3d Cir. 1993) (allowing over a one year delay in\n\nthe production of documents is not an abuse of discretion); Beard\n\nv. Braunstein, 914 F.2d 434, 446 (3d Cir. 1990) (affirming\n\nmonetary sanction for failure to answer interrogatories); Comdyne\n\nI, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142, 1146 (3d Cir. 1990) (affirming\n\ndistrict court order striking the pleadings for failure to answer\n\ninterrogatories).   Nonetheless, the district court's discretion\n\nhas boundaries, and in particular, we frown upon unnecessary\n\ndiscovery limitations in Title VII, and hence ADEA, cases.     See\nTrevino v. Celanese Corp., 701 F.2d 397, 405 (5th Cir. 1983).        In\n\nsuch cases, other courts have refused, and now we refuse, \"to\n\n(..continued)\nthe need to conform to the standards of discovery practice which\nhave long been established in the District of New Jersey.\n\fallow procedural technicalities to impede the full vindication of\n\nguaranteed rights.\"    Id. at 406.   A plaintiff in an ADEA case, as\n\nSempier is here, should not be hamstrung by the district court in\n\nlimiting his discovery.    In substituting a \"Bill of Particulars\"\n\nfor those means of discovery authorized by the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, the district court here far exceeded the\n\noutermost limits on its discretion.\n\n             Since 1938, civil discovery has been an attorney-\n\ninitiated, attorney-focused procedure.    The vast majority of\n\nfederal discovery tools operate, when used properly, almost\n\nentirely without the court's involvement.     See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(f) (requiring the parties to devise and submit a discovery\n\nplan); Fed. R. Civ. P. 30 (\"[A] party may take the testimony of\n\nany person, including a party, by deposition upon oral\n\nexamination without leave of court.\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)\n\n(production of documents); cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 35 (providing for\n\nphysical examinations only by leave of the court); see also\n\nWilliam Schwartzer, The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and\n\nDiscovery Reform, 50 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 703, 714-16 (1989).\n\n             Indeed under the recent amendments to Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 26(a), which became effective December 1, 1993 in\n\nthe District of New Jersey, a party must provide discovery\n\n\"without waiting [for] a discovery request.\"    Under this scheme,\n\nwhen civil litigation proceeds smoothly, the parties conduct\n\ndiscovery with minimal interference from and minimal appeal to\n\nthe court.    Through the discovery process, even before the\n\namendments became effective, the attorneys obtain answers to\n\fquestions that they feel are relevant to the issues if not\n\ndeterminative of the issues.   8A Charles Allen Wright & Arthur P.\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2162 (1970).   Nowhere in\n\nthe process is the district court authorized to initiate its own\n\nquestioning or to seek documents for itself.   See John H.\n\nLangbein, The German Advantage in Civil Procedure, 52 U. Chi. L.\n\nRev. 823, 827-30 (1985) (noting the difference between civil law\n\nprocedure in which judges initiate the investigation and common\n\nlaw procedure in which the parties conduct the investigation).\n\n          When the parties stray from this course, Rule 37\n\nprovides the court with tools to give the litigants new and\n\nproper bearings.   A court may compel answers to interrogatories\n\nor deposition questions, compel the production of documents, or\n\nconversely, grant protective orders.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37; Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 26(b)(5)(c).   If these measures fail, a court may order\n\nfacts established, forbid the introduction of evidence, strike\n\nthe pleadings, file a default judgment, dismiss the action, or\n\nhold a party in contempt of court.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b); see\n\nalso National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc.,\n\n427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) (upholding dismissal of a claim for\n\ndiscovery violations); Quinter v. Volkswagen of America, 676 F.2d\n969 (3d Cir. 1982) (affirming an order holding a party in\n\ncontempt for violation of discovery procedures).   However, none\n\nof the weapons in this formidable arsenal include the wholesale\n\nsubstitution of court-engineered discovery.\n\n          The district court was evidently not content with the\n\ncontents of its discovery arsenal.   Rather, it abandoned the\n\fstructure and command of the Rules to revive a procedural device\n\nabandoned in civil practice forty-five years ago.      See Singer\n\nManufacturing Co. v. Axelrod, 16 F.R.D. 460, 461 (S.D.N.Y. 1954)\n\n(noting the elimination of the \"Bill of Particulars\" in favor of\n\ninterrogatories in 1948); Wright & Miller, supra ยง 2167 (1970 &\n\nsupp. 1994) (stating that Fed. R. Civ. P. 33 replaced the \"Bill\n\nof Particulars\" in equity in 1948 without lament).      Although\n\nstill used in criminal matters, a \"Bill of Particulars\" has not\n\ngraced the shores of federal civil discovery since the 1950s.       8\n\nJames Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ยถ 7.06[1] (2d ed.\n\n1994).    Even in criminal matters, a \"Bill of Particulars\" is not\n\ngenerally considered a discovery device.   Id. (citing among other\n\ncases United States v. Smith, 776 F.2d 1104, 1111 (3d Cir.\n\n1985)).    In this case, it was not only an unwelcome and\n\ninappropriate incursion by the district court into the parties'\n\ndispute, but it severely trenched upon the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure which have been crafted to provide information as to\n\nmatters relevant to the issues disputed.    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(d)(1).\n\n            Sempier had served his interrogatories in compliance\n\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33.    The Rule provides,\n\n\"[e]ach interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in\n\nwriting under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the\n\nobjecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall\n\nanswer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable.\"\n\nJ & H believed the interrogatories were objectionable and stated\n\nits objections.    Sempier sought to compel answers.\n\f           The court could have denied the discovery on the ground\n\nthat it was privileged, burdensome, duplicative, or otherwise\n\noutside of the scope of discovery.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).   It\n\ncould have compelled answers and awarded attorney's fees and/or\n\nsanctions.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b).   It did none of these things\n\nnor did it comply with its obligation to consider and rule upon\n\neach interrogatory to which J & H objected.     See Nestle Foods\n\nCorp. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 135 F.R.D. 101, 109-112\n\n(D.N.J. 1990); Robbins v. Camden City Bd. of Educ., 105 F.R.D.\n\n49, 57-60 (D.N.J. 1983).    Rather than rule upon the objections,\n\nthe district court decided that \"[the] Magistrate Judge . . .\n\nprovided a mechanism (bill of particulars) for further discovery\n\nregarding the precise issue outlined in this Court's September 7,\n\n1993 Order.\"    App. 611.\n\n           The district court may have disliked its obligation to\n\nexamine each interrogatory and review the magistrate judge's\n\nruling.   Regardless of its feelings, the district court, guided\n\nonly by its own discretion and determination of what is important\n\nor relevant, could not rewrite a party's questions and in effect\n\nserve its own set of interrogatories.     When the court took upon\n\nitself to author the questions being asked, it virtually became a\n\nparticipant in the parties' controversy in a manner inconsistent\n\nwith fundamental conceptions of the role of a judge in our common\n\nlaw system.\n\n           In this case, the district court reformulated Sempier's\n\ninterrogatories into four broad questions about Sempier's\n\nperformance.    The magistrate judge reframed specific requests\n\fpertaining to the reasons considered by J & H, and the reasons\n\nupon which J & H actually relied to terminate Sempier, into a\n\nvague question, \"[w]hy were Plaintiff's job responsibilities\n\nreassigned?\"   Pertinent and direct interrogatories, that were\n\npropounded by Sempier, sought the dates of conversations\n\nregarding Sempier's performance and the names of the participants\n\nin those discussions.    Those interrogatories were replaced by the\n\ndistrict court with a vague and general \"Bill of Particulars.\"\n\nBecause the district court's questions were, with one exception,\n\ngeneral, nonspecific, and broad, the resulting answers, to the\n\nextent that they answered the questions at all, were\n\nuninformative and of little value.    Sempier had good reason to\n\ndraft specific interrogatories and had a right to expect\n\ncorrespondingly specific answers.    The district court's\n\nsubstitution of its own work product denied Sempier this\n\nopportunity.\n\n          We have examined the Supplemental Bill of Particulars\n\n(App. 766-772) which contains the questions framed by the\n\nmagistrate judge and the district court judge, and we have\n\nexamined closely J & H's answers.    Those answers can best be\n\ndescribed as an attempt, if not to outwit, then to frustrate all\n\nlegitimate efforts to furnish information to an adversary.10\n\nMoreover, whereas Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33 provides\n\nthat interrogatories must be answered under oath and thus may be\n\nevidentiary, there is no such provision in the Federal Rules of\n\n10\n .   See note 9 supra.\n\fCivil Procedure for a \"Bill of Particulars.\"    Indeed, there is no\n\nprovision at all for \"Bills of Particulars\" -- and for good\n\nreason.    As we have noted, \"Bills of Particulars\" were replaced\n\nby the discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nWright & Miller, supra ยง 2167.\n\n            The district court's action was unauthorized by the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and in violation of the\n\nprinciples of our jurisprudence.    The Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, which must obtain Supreme Court and Congressional\n\napproval, not only prescribe the procedures to be followed by\n\ncounsel, but they also prescribe the Rules under which the courts\n\noperate.    See Umbenhauer v. Woog, 969 F.2d 25, 32 (3d Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"Neither we, the Department of State, nor the Administrative\n\nOffice of the United States Courts possess the authority to\n\ncircumvent, ignore or deviate from the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, which were approved by the Judicial Conference of the\n\nUnited States, the Supreme Court of the United States, and\n\nCongress.\")    By venturing so far outside the parameters set by\n\nthe Rules, the court abused its discretion.\n\n            Our discussion and holding here does not leave the\n\ndistrict court powerless to manage the discovery difficulties\n\npresented by this and similar cases.    On the contrary, the\n\ndistrict court has considerable authority and discretion by which\n\nto resolve discovery disputes.     Indeed, if discovery has reached\n\nan impasse or a nonproductive stage either through counsel's\n\nobstinacy, intransigence, or even incompetence, the district\n\ncourt can always, through appropriate intervention, suggest the\n\fproper manner in which questions should be asked and the answers\n\nfurnished.   A district court's creativity in this respect is\n\nunrestricted, although it cannot, of course, disregard the\n\ncommands of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, as in this\n\ncase, substitute a \"Bill of Particulars\" for a party's relevant\n\ndiscovery.   It can, however, always give counsel guidance and\n\ndirection as to the manner in which discovery should proceed.\n\n          If, after an examination of a party's interrogatories,\n\nthe district court determines that the interrogatories are\n\ninappropriate, the court can refuse to compel answers.    If a\n\nparty is unable to draft satisfactory interrogatories after a\n\nreasonable time for discovery has concluded, the court can limit\n\nfurther discovery.   If the court feels either party was acting in\n\nbad faith, it can impose sanctions.   Certainly, if a party,\n\nwithout justification, refuses to answer interrogatories in the\n\nmanner required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33, the court\n\ncan compel answers under threat of sanctions.   Any or all of\n\nthese options could have been employed in this case.     Any and all\n\nof these options would have received substantial deference upon\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n                               VII\n\n          We will reverse the summary judgment of the district\n\ncourt dated March 9, 1994 and remand.   On remand, the district\n\ncourt is directed to vacate the magistrate judge's order of\n\nAugust 7, 1993 and to vacate its own order of November 3, 1993\n\nwhich approved and modified a \"Bill of Particulars.\"     The\n\fdistrict court is also directed to permit and schedule additional\n\nappropriate and adequate discovery pursuant to the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure so that further proceedings, including trial,\n\nmay be conducted consistent with the foregoing opinion.11\n\n\n\n\n11\n . The district court's order of March 9, 1994 dismissed Counts\nFour through Six without prejudice to Sempier proceeding on those\ncounts in state court. Those counts involved state law contract\nand corporate law causes of action. The record before us is\naccordingly silent as to those matters. Nor do we know if those\nclaims are proceeding in state court. It will be for the\ndistrict court on remand to ascertain and resolve the status of\nthose claims.\n\f",

Sempier now appeals the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment on his Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct (ADEA) claim, 29 U.S.C. ยง 263 (1988),1 and the discretionary\n\ndismissal of his pendent state law claims.     He also raises as\n\nerror the district court's substitution of a \"Bill of\n\nParticulars\" in place of his interrogatories.\n\n\n\n1\n.   29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a) in relevant part provides:\n\n          It shall be unlawful for an employer--\n               (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n          individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n          individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n          conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\n          such individual's age;\n               (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n          in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n          individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n          adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n          such individual's age . . . .\n\f          We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 to\n\nreview the March 9, 1994 final order of the district court.\n\nBecause the record reflects a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding whether J & H's asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\ndischarging Sempier are pretextual, we will reverse the summary\n\njudgment entered in favor of J & H.   We also conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in substituting its own\n\n\"Bill of Particulars\" for Sempier's interrogatories.\n\n\n\n                                I\n\n          Sempier joined appellee J & H, an insurance brokerage\n\nand employee benefits consulting firm, in 1968.2   Sempier worked\n\nas Comptroller until 1971 when he became Treasurer of J & H.      In\n\n1984, J & H created a new position of Chief Financial Officer\n\n(\"CFO\"), and the Board of Directors elected Sempier to that post.\n\n          The parties dispute whether the J & H directors\n\ncriticized Sempier's performance as CFO.    Sempier avers that no\n\none advised him that his performance was less than satisfactory\n\nnor did anyone bring to his attention any deficiencies in his\n\nperformance of his functions.   App. 300.   Robert Hatcher, the\n\nfirm's chairman who was Sempier's friend and had been\n\ninstrumental in Sempier being elected as CFO, states that he was\n\ngenerally pleased with Sempier's work.   At the same time, he\n\nacknowledges that other directors had criticized Sempier's\n\n2\n . J & H is a closely held New Jersey corporation. It operates\nas if it were a partnership. All stockholders are members of the\nfirm. All directors are employees of the firm.\n\fperformance.    App. 363-65.    Other J & H directors state in\n\naffidavits that they believed that Sempier performed below\n\nexpectations.    App. 727 (affidavit of Eric Johnson); App. 778-79\n\n(affidavit of Kenneth Hecken).\n\n           In 1985, one year after Sempier assumed his duties as\n\nCFO, an outside audit of the Finance Department, requested by\n\nJ & H director Eric Johnson, criticized the department's\n\noperations.    App. 728-29.    After further investigation, Johnson\n\nsought to have Sempier replaced.      Despite Johnson's criticisms,\n\nJ & H unanimously elected Sempier to the Board of Directors in\n\n1986.   Hatcher supported Sempier's election to the Board of\n\nDirectors because he believed that this move would assist Sempier\n\nin improving the Finance Department's operations.      When Sempier\n\nwas elected, J & H required that he execute a letter of\n\nresignation that would become effective upon a two-thirds vote of\n\nthe Board of Directors.\n\n           In May 1987, J & H removed Sempier from his\n\nresponsibilities as CFO and made him Chief Administrative Officer\n\n(\"CAO\") in charge of Management Information Systems (\"MIS\"),\n\nHuman Resources, Professional Development, and Real Estate and\n\nFacilities.    Sempier was unanimously reelected to the Board in\n\n1989.   Both sides dispute how Sempier performed as CAO.\n\n           Due to the increasing importance of MIS services and\n\nthe department's unsatisfactory record, J & H decided to elevate\n\nthe MIS department's status by hiring a Chief Information Officer\n\n(\"CIO\"), thereby removing MIS from Sempier's supervision.\n\nNotwithstanding some lobbying by Hatcher, the firm denied Sempier\n\fthe CIO position.    In December 1989, J & H hired Alan Page, who\n\nis fourteen years younger than Sempier, as CIO.     The directors\n\nelected Page to the board in 1990.\n\n           Three months later, J & H hired Thomas Carpenter, who\n\nis four years younger than Sempier, to assume responsibility for\n\nHuman Resources and Professional Development, starting in May\n\n1990.   Carpenter's arrival left Sempier with significantly\n\nreduced responsibilities.\n\n           In May 1989, before either Page or Carpenter had been\n\nhired, J & H had instituted an early retirement program to retire\n\n\"redundant\" and \"poorly performing\" employees who were 55 years\n\nof age or older.    App. 636-37.   The firm intended to use the\n\nprogram either to \"pull\" employees into retirement through\n\nincentives or to \"push\" them into retirement through involuntary\n\n\"terminations\" which were to be characterized as downsizing.\n\nApp. 637 (Exhibit 8).\n\n           In April 1990, Hatcher, who was still the Chairman of\n\nJ & H, advised Sempier to retire early with certain enhancements\n\nto his existing retirement package.     Hatcher stated that Sempier\n\nhad \"lost credibility\" with unnamed senior managers.     App. 301.\n\nSempier refused to retire.    Hatcher responded, using strong and\n\nunequivocal language, that Sempier had no choice but to retire or\n\nto be forced out.    App. 302.\n\n           Between April 1990 and April 1991, J & H engaged in\n\nextended, and occasionally bitter, negotiations with Sempier\n\nseeking to obtain his retirement or resignation.     In January\n\n1991, David Olsen succeeded Hatcher as Chairman of J & H.     When,\n\fin the spring of 1991, Sempier told Olsen that he had hired a\n\nlawyer, Olsen told Sempier that he could no longer return to\n\nJ & H and should vacate his office.     App. 81.   At the same time,\n\nOlsen wrote the firm's general counsel that \"[i]t's obviously\n\ntime for hardball.\"   App. 80.   After Sempier consistently refused\n\nto retire, the Board made effective Sempier's previously executed\n\nresignation in June 1991.\n\n           Sempier filed an age discrimination claim with the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, received a right to sue\n\nletter, and instituted an ADEA suit in the District of New Jersey\n\nwith pendent state law claims for   breach of contract as well as\n\nviolations of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and the\n\nNew Jersey Business Corporations Act.    J & H answered that\n\nSempier had been discharged for poor performance.\n\n           At the outset of the litigation, Sempier served two\n\nsets of interrogatories and a series of document requests on\n\nJ & H.    When J & H refused to respond to a substantial portion of\n\nthe discovery requested, Sempier sought an order from the\n\nmagistrate judge which would have compelled J & H to respond.\n\nThe magistrate judge denied Sempier's motion.      On appeal, the\n\ndistrict court judge vacated the order of denial but remanded the\n\ndispute to the magistrate judge without entering an order\n\ncompelling discovery.   On remand, the magistrate judge relieved\n\nJ & H from answering the original two sets of interrogatories and\n\nrequired that Sempier draft a third set of interrogatories.         App.\n\n563-64.   After J & H refused to answer almost all of these\n\ninterrogatories, Sempier again sought a second order compelling\n\fdiscovery.   The magistrate judge denied Sempier's motion to\n\ncompel answers and ordered J & H to provide information\n\nresponding to a \"Bill of Particulars\" drafted by the court.    App.\n\n576.   On appeal, the district court affirmed the magistrate\n\njudge's order and added one question of its own to the \"Bill of\n\nParticulars.\"\n\n           Between November and December 1993, the parties\n\ndisputed whether J & H had complied with the court's orders to\n\nanswer the court's questions and to provide documents.    In\n\nDecember, Sempier filed additional motions for an order to compel\n\ndiscovery and for partial summary judgment.   J & H replied with\n\nits motion for summary judgment.\n\n           The district court granted J & H's summary judgment\n\nmotion on the ADEA claim and dismissed the remaining pendent\n\nclaims without prejudice.   The district court expressed concern\n\nthat Sempier had not made out a prima facie case because of an\n\ninability to show that he was a qualified employee or replaced by\n\na sufficiently younger employee to raise an inference of age\n\ndiscrimination.   Nonetheless, it turned to J & H's asserted\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for Sempier's discharge and Sempier's\n\nevidence of pretext.\n\n           The district court found that J & H had come forward\n\nwith two alleged reasons for Sempier's discharge: (1) that\n\nSempier's reduced responsibilities did not justify his continued\n\npresence on the Board of Directors and (2) that Sempier's poor\n\nperformance had justified the reduction in his responsibilities\n\nand eventual discharge.   Moreover, the district court held that\n\fSempier had not produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to\n\nfind that J & H's alleged nondiscriminatory reasons were a\n\npretext for discrimination.    Accordingly, the court entered a\n\njudgment in favor of J & H, denied Sempier's motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment, and dismissed Sempier's pendent state law\n\nclaims without prejudice.\n\n          Sempier filed a timely appeal.\n\n\n\n                                  II\n\n                                  A.\n\n             When we review a grant of summary judgment, we apply\n\nthe same test that the district court should have applied\n\ninitially.

The combined differences in age between Sempier on the\n\none hand and Page and Carpenter on the other is clearly\n\fsufficient to satisfy the fourth prong of a prima facie case by\n\nraising an inference of age discrimination.5\n\n\n\n                               IV\n\n                               A.\n\n          Having concluded that the record is more than\n\nsufficient to dispel the district court's doubts as to Sempier's\n\nprima facie case, we turn now to consider the evidence of J & H's\n\nalleged reasons for Sempier's discharge.   As we earlier stated,\n\nafter the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the\n\n\n5\n . J & H contends that we cannot consider the transfer of\nSempier's duties to Page because it occurred outside of the 300\nday period for filing a separate claim of age discrimination.\nJ & H's Brief at 38; see 29 U.S.C. ยง 626(d) (providing a 300 day\nperiod in which to file an administrative charge).\n\n          The argument is disingenuous. J & H relies on the\nincremental removal of Sempier's management responsibility over\nManagement Information Systems to justify Sempier's dismissal;\nhowever, J & H asks us to limit our consideration of Sempier's\ncase to the facts that fall within the 300 days immediately prior\nto when Sempier filed his administrative charge. Although\nCarpenter was the last person to assume any of Sempier's\nresponsibilities, the process that led to Sempier's eventual\ndischarge began with the transfer of MIS authority from Sempier\nto Page.\n\n          The statute of limitations for filing a charge of\ndiscrimination may have barred our consideration of the transfer\nof MIS authority to Page if that was Sempier's cause of action,\nbut it does not prevent us from considering that event in order\nto determine whether Sempier has raised an inference of age\ndiscrimination as a part of his prima facie case.

Hicks, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2747;\n\nChipollini, 814 F.2d at 897.\n\n          Here, J & H has presented two reasons.     First, J & H\n\nstates that it terminated Sempier because his company duties no\n\nlonger justified retaining him in his position.     Second, it\n\ncontends that Sempier performed those duties poorly.     J & H\n\nattempted to establish each of these justifications through\n\naffidavits of J & H executives and directors.      As we understand\n\nthe record, J & H's nondiscriminatory reasons for Sempier's\n\ndischarge come down to this:     Sempier performed so poorly that\n\nalmost all of his responsibilities at the firm were transferred\n\nto others, leading ultimately to Sempier's discharge.\n\n          J & H produced the affidavits of two directors, who had\n\npreviously supervised Sempier, reflecting the directors'\n\ndiscontent with Sempier's work.     App. 778-79, 783-84 (affidavit\n\nof Hecken); App. 726-32 (affidavit of Johnson).     Additionally,\n\nHatcher's affidavit averred that many directors did not regard\n\nSempier highly and that Hatcher had used his influence to have\n\nSempier elected to the Board against the other directors' wishes.\n\nApp. 365, 369-70.      To corroborate these assertions, J & H\n\nincluded a consultant's report that criticized the operations of\n\nthe finance department during 1985-1987 when Sempier served as\n\nCFO.   App. 738-749.    Finally, the company produced documents\n\ndisclosing that Sempier received less compensation from the\n\fdirectors' merit compensation pool than some of the other\n\ndirectors who held comparable positions.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n           On the other hand, Sempier claims that these\n\nallegations of poor performance are not worthy of credence and\n\nare no more than a pretext for discrimination.    The Supreme\n\nCourt, in Saint Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, __ U.S. __, 113 S.\n\nCt. 2742 (1993), recently clarified the showing of pretext that a\n\nplaintiff must make to win a discrimination case.    Rejection of\n\nthe employer's nondiscriminatory explanation does not compel a\n\nverdict in favor of the employee, but it permits the trier of\n\nfact to infer discrimination and find for the plaintiff on the\n\nbasis of the allegations of discrimination in his prima facie\n\ncase.

Sempier\n\nemphasizes three evidentiary threads which create a genuine issue\n\nof material fact.   He first points to statements in his own\n\naffidavit, in Hatcher's affidavit, and in Hatcher's deposition\n\ntestimony that his performance was satisfactory.    App. 321, 325\n\n(Sempier); App. 363-65 (Hatcher); App. 797 (Hatcher).    The\n\ndistrict court found that Hatcher's additional statement that\n\nother directors did not agree with Hatcher's favorable assessment\n\nundermined the credibility of Hatcher's assertions of\n\nsatisfactory performance.    While we may or may not find Sempier's\n\nself evaluation and Hatcher's assessments of Sempier's\n\nperformance to be compelling evaluations of Sempier's work, it is\n\nneither our role nor the district court's role on summary\n\njudgment to compare the testimony of various affiants and decide\n\fwho is credible.    Chipollini, 814 F.2d at 901; Josey, 996 F.2d at\n\n637.\n\n          The district court, citing Billet v. CIGNA Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566008\"><a href=\"/opinion/566008/56-fair-emplpraccas-730-56-empl-prac-dec-p-40887-lewis-h-billet/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1991), also concluded that Sempier's self\n\nevaluation was meaningless because only J & H's evaluation of\n\nSempier's performance was at issue.   Billet states that the\n\ninquiry into pretext centers upon the employer's beliefs and not\n\nthe employee's own perceptions.    Id. at 825 (\"However,\n\n[plaintiff's] view of his performance is not at issue; what\n\nmatters is the perception of the decision maker.\").   Nonetheless,\n\nBillet does not stand for the proposition that the employee's\n\nbelief that his performance was satisfactory is never relevant.\n\nBillet concluded that the employee's assertions of his own good\n\nperformance were insufficient to prevent summary judgment where\n\nthe employer produced performance reviews and other documentary\n\nevidence of misconduct and insubordination that demonstrated poor\n\nperformance.   Id. at 818-22.\n\n          Where, as here, Sempier asserts not only that he\n\nperformed well but that he never received any unfavorable\n\ncriticism that his performance was poor or inadequate, the jury\n\ncould conclude that J & H's failure to fault Sempier's\n\nperformance for the twenty years prior to the negotiations\n\nleading to his discharge makes suspect its post hoc assertions of\npoor performance.   This is especially true when J & H has failed\n\nto produce any other evidence of poor performance or make\n\nspecific allegations of Sempier's deficiencies.\n\f          Sempier next points to two formal performance\n\nevaluations from 1988 and 1989 in which Hecken, Sempier's\n\nsupervisor, wrote that Sempier's performance was satisfactory.\n\nApp. 308-19.   In considering these evaluations, the district\n\ncourt stated, solely on the basis of Hecken's affidavit, that\n\n\"[t]he evaluations were a first attempt by Defendant to open the\n\nlines of communication between lower level directors and the\n\nsenior members of the board to whom they reported.   Viewed in\n\nthis light, they are of little value in determining Plaintiff's\n\ntrue level of performance.\"   App. 906.   In so stating, the\n\ndistrict court ignored the testimony of Hatcher at his deposition\n\nthat any critical comments concerning Sempier's performance\n\nshould be recorded in the performance evaluations.   App. 799.\n\nHatcher also said that the compensation committee had previously\n\nused the evaluations in determining directors' compensation.\n\nApp. 824-26.   On summary judgment, it is not the court's role to\n\nweigh the disputed evidence and decide which is more probative.\n\n          Finally, Sempier points to the coercive early\n\nretirement program that J & H instituted shortly before it forced\n\nSempier's resignation.   J & H documents showed that the company\n\ninstituted this program to generate a significant number of\n\nretirements largely through monetary incentives.   The district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that the use of an early retirement\n\nprogram to dismiss redundant or underperforming employees is not\n\nby itself a violation of the ADEA.   See Gray v.

On the other hand, an early retirement\n\nprogram designed to force employees who reach a senior age to\n\nleave or face significant pressure to resign or retire might\n\nitself create an inference of age discrimination.    Gray, 957 U.S.\n\nat 1081 (citing Henn v. National Geographic Soc'y, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488800\"><a href=\"/opinion/488800/robert-r-henn-v-national-geographic-society/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n826, 828-29 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987)).     It\n\nis impermissible to force older employees to choose between\n\nretirement or termination in an effort to eliminate older workers\n\non account of their age.\n\n          The record clearly discloses that Hatcher told Sempier\n\nin no uncertain terms that he could either retire, face\n\ncontinuing pressures to retire, or be terminated.6   The record\n\nalso reflects a mandatory policy at J & H that directors must\n\nretire at set intervals corresponding to age.   Later, after the\n\ncompany learned that Sempier had sought legal counsel, Olsen,\n\nJ & H's Chairman, told Sempier to pack his office and leave.\n\nWhile this evidence does not itself establish age discrimination,\n\na jury might reasonably determine from these events that J & H\n\noffered Sempier early retirement as an effort to remove him\n\nbecause of his age and not because of poor performance.\n\n          In cases such as the present one, the question for the\n\ncourt is whether the record \"could support an inference that the\n\nemployer did not act for non-discriminatory reasons, not whether\n\n6\n . In the April meeting at which Hatcher recommended early\nretirement, Sempier recites that Hatcher told Sempier that\nunnamed J & H managers \"would let me [Sempier] rot, would cut my\nballs off and otherwise make it unpleasant for me to stay.\" App.\n302.\n\fthe evidence necessarily leads to that conclusion that the\n\nemployer did act for discriminatory reasons.\"    Chipollini, 814\n\nF.2d at 900 (emphasis in original); see also Fuentes, 32 F.3d at\n\n764 (stating that the plaintiff need not show more than that the\n\nemployer's articulated reasons were implausible to survive\n\nsummary judgment).    When the evidence is read in the light most\n\nfavorable to Sempier, a jury could reasonably find that J & H did\n\nnot terminate him because of poor performance but rather\n\ndischarged him because of his age.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n          To recap, once Sempier had made out a prima facie case\n\nof age discrimination, a presumption arose that J & H had\n\ndiscriminated against him.     Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254.   J & H\n\ndispelled that presumption by coming forward with a\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for Sempier's discharge, leaving nothing\n\nbut the permissible inference of discrimination created by the\n\nprima facie case.     Hicks, __ U.S. at __; 113 S. Ct. at 2748-49.\n\nSempier's attack on J & H's stated reasons for his discharge\n\nleaves us with the paradigmatic case in which each party has\n\nproduced testimony and evidence that conflicts on the ultimate\n\nissue -- whether Sempier was discharged for poor performance or\n\nbecause of his age.    The resulting conflict must be resolved by a\n\njury and cannot be resolved on summary judgment.    Thus, the\n\nsummary judgment entered in favor of J & H must be reversed.7\n\n7\n . Sempier also raises as error the district court's denial of a\npartial summary judgment in his favor on the issue of liability.\n\f                                VI\n\n          In addition to challenging the district court's order\n\nwhich granted summary judgment to J & H, an order which we now\n\nhold must be reversed, Sempier also complains that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in ruling on his discovery efforts.\n\nIn so doing, Sempier contends that he was prevented from\n\nmarshalling additional evidence establishing that J & H's\n\nproffered reason for his discharge was pretextual.8\n\n          We normally do not become involved with \"nitty gritty\"\n\nrulings on discovery matters.   Nor do we generally engage in\n\nexercises to determine whether a party's interrogatories are\n\nrelevant or are unduly burdensome.   This appeal, however,\n\nrequires that we review the actions taken by the magistrate judge\n\nand the district court judge with respect to discovery sought and\n\nanswered by the parties.   While we will not examine each jot and\n\n\n\n\n(..continued)\nSempier argues that J & H presented no evidence of his poor\nperformance. As we have discussed in text, the record reflects\nthat both Sempier and J & H have adduced conflicting evidence\nover the reason for his discharge. This resulting conflict could\nnot be resolved by summary judgment in Sempier's favor.\n8\n . Sempier strongly disputes J & H's contention that he had\nchosen to resist J & H's renewed motion for summary judgment\nwithout completing the depositions that had been scheduled.\nSempier claims that the documents he sought from J & H were\nessential in order to conduct his remaining depositions. He\nasserts that the district court for that reason alone should have\ndenied J & H's motion for summary judgment and should have\npermitted Sempier to complete his discovery. (Sempier Reply\nBrief at p. 23.)\n\ftittle of the discovery process, it is important to our analysis\n\nthat some background be furnished.\n\n          Sempier's complaint was filed in April 1992.     In June\n\n1992, Sempier served his first set of interrogatories and a\n\nrequest for production of documents.   In July 1992, Sempier\n\nserved a second set of interrogatories with a second request for\n\nproduction of documents.   Unfortunately, not all of the\n\ninterrogatories that were served have found their way into the\n\nrecord, and thus, into the appendix.   We have examined those that\n\nhave been reproduced in the appendix, and we find it difficult to\n\nunderstand how the magistrate judge could have condoned the\n\nanswers given by J & H.    Moreover, we are perplexed by the\n\nfailure of the magistrate judge or the district court judge to\n\ncompel responsive answers to the interrogatories -- almost all of\n\nwhich appear to us to be relevant and directed to the issues of\n\nSempier's employment, performance and relationship with J & H.\n\n          For example, Interrogatory No. 36 sought the name of\n\neach and every person who had supervision and/or control over\n\nSempier from January 1, 1986 through the termination of Sempier's\n\nemployment.   It also sought, with respect to each such supervisor\n\nidentified, the job title, the department supervised, the duties\n\nand responsibilities of the job, the date on which he or she\n\nassumed the supervisory position, and, if the individual was not\n\nstill employed, the date and reason of termination and the last\n\nknown address.   True, that interrogatory sought as well the date\n\nof hire, date of birth and educational background, but those\n\nthree inquiries, if not deemed relevant in the district court's\n\fjudgment, could have been excised and the remainder of the\n\ninterrogatory answered.    Yet J & H objected to the interrogatory\n\non the grounds that it was \"overbroad, unduly burdensome, and\n\nexceeding the scope of permissible discovery.\"    J & H then\n\nreferred Sempier to a J & H Position Statement which does not\n\neven appear to be part of the record.\n\n          Again, Interrogatory No. 44 asked J & H if it\n\nvoluntarily terminated the employment and/or relationship of\n\nSempier with J & H.    J & H's response reads:   \"Defendant refers\n\nplaintiff to pages 3 through 17 of the J & H Position Statement.\"\n\nThe following interrogatory, Interrogatory No. 45, sought the\n\ndates on which the decision to terminate Sempier was made, and\n\nJ & H's response was \"See Interrogatory No. 44.\"     Interrogatory\n\nNo. 46 sought the factual basis for J & H's decision to terminate\n\nSempier and/or the relationship of Sempier with J & H.    The\n\nanswer given by J & H:    \"Defendant refers plaintiff to the J & H\n\nPosition Statement.\"    The other interrogatories which we have\n\nreviewed -- all seemingly relevant -- have been answered in much\n\nthe same manner.   All of J & H's answers disregard the\n\nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.     See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 33(a) (requiring separate and complete answers unless\n\nspecific objections are provided); 26(b) (defining the scope of\n\ndiscovery) (1993 version).9\n\n9\n . Lead counsel for J & H is apparently the New York law firm of\nSullivan & Cromwell. Perhaps this accounts for the lack of\nfamiliarity with New Jersey Federal Court practice. We note,\nhowever, that J & H had local counsel. It is a matter of concern\nto us that the discovery practice in this case was so badly\nabused when at the least, local counsel had to have recognized\n\f          Without dwelling further on this subject, we observe\n\nthat the magistrate judge did not compel the answers which\n\nSempier sought.   Rather, he relieved J & H from answering the\n\nvarious discovery requests and instructed Sempier to issue a\n\nthird set of interrogatories and a third document request.   The\n\nlatter two discovery requests were no more answered than the\n\nearlier ones.   In lieu of compelling answers to the third set of\n\ninterrogatories served by Sempier, the district court instructed\n\nJ & H to answer a four question \"Bill of Particulars.\"\n\n          Against this background, we consider Sempier's\n\narguments.   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and our\n\njurisprudence, district courts have broad discretion to manage\n\ndiscovery.   See, e.g., Walter v.

In\n\nsuch cases, other courts have refused, and now we refuse, \"to\n\n(..continued)\nthe need to conform to the standards of discovery practice which\nhave long been established in the District of New Jersey.\n\fallow procedural technicalities to impede the full vindication of\n\nguaranteed rights.\"    Id. at 406.   A plaintiff in an ADEA case, as\n\nSempier is here, should not be hamstrung by the district court in\n\nlimiting his discovery.    In substituting a \"Bill of Particulars\"\n\nfor those means of discovery authorized by the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, the district court here far exceeded the\n\noutermost limits on its discretion.\n\n             Since 1938, civil discovery has been an attorney-\n\ninitiated, attorney-focused procedure.    The vast majority of\n\nfederal discovery tools operate, when used properly, almost\n\nentirely without the court's involvement.     See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(f) (requiring the parties to devise and submit a discovery\n\nplan); Fed. R. Civ. P. 30 (\"[A] party may take the testimony of\n\nany person, including a party, by deposition upon oral\n\nexamination without leave of court.\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)\n\n(production of documents); cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 35 (providing for\n\nphysical examinations only by leave of the court); see also\n\nWilliam Schwartzer, The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and\n\nDiscovery Reform, 50 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 703, 714-16 (1989).\n\n             Indeed under the recent amendments to Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 26(a), which became effective December 1, 1993 in\n\nthe District of New Jersey, a party must provide discovery\n\n\"without waiting [for] a discovery request.\"    Under this scheme,\n\nwhen civil litigation proceeds smoothly, the parties conduct\n\ndiscovery with minimal interference from and minimal appeal to\n\nthe court.    Through the discovery process, even before the\n\namendments became effective, the attorneys obtain answers to\n\fquestions that they feel are relevant to the issues if not\n\ndeterminative of the issues.   8A Charles Allen Wright & Arthur P.\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2162 (1970).   Nowhere in\n\nthe process is the district court authorized to initiate its own\n\nquestioning or to seek documents for itself.   See John H.\n\nLangbein, The German Advantage in Civil Procedure, 52 U. Chi. L.\n\nRev. 823, 827-30 (1985) (noting the difference between civil law\n\nprocedure in which judges initiate the investigation and common\n\nlaw procedure in which the parties conduct the investigation).\n\n          When the parties stray from this course, Rule 37\n\nprovides the court with tools to give the litigants new and\n\nproper bearings.   A court may compel answers to interrogatories\n\nor deposition questions, compel the production of documents, or\n\nconversely, grant protective orders.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37; Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 26(b)(5)(c).   If these measures fail, a court may order\n\nfacts established, forbid the introduction of evidence, strike\n\nthe pleadings, file a default judgment, dismiss the action, or\n\nhold a party in contempt of court.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b); see\n\nalso National Hockey League v.

However, none\n\nof the weapons in this formidable arsenal include the wholesale\n\nsubstitution of court-engineered discovery.\n\n          The district court was evidently not content with the\n\ncontents of its discovery arsenal.   Rather, it abandoned the\n\fstructure and command of the Rules to revive a procedural device\n\nabandoned in civil practice forty-five years ago.      See Singer\n\nManufacturing Co. v.

R. Civ. P. 33 replaced the \"Bill\n\nof Particulars\" in equity in 1948 without lament).      Although\n\nstill used in criminal matters, a \"Bill of Particulars\" has not\n\ngraced the shores of federal civil discovery since the 1950s.       8\n\nJames Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ยถ 7.06[1] (2d ed.\n\n1994).    Even in criminal matters, a \"Bill of Particulars\" is not\n\ngenerally considered a discovery device.   Id. (citing among other\n\ncases United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460926\"><a href=\"/opinion/460926/united-states-v-smith-william-t-jr-patriot-news-company-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1111 (3d Cir.\n\n1985)).    In this case, it was not only an unwelcome and\n\ninappropriate incursion by the district court into the parties'\n\ndispute, but it severely trenched upon the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure which have been crafted to provide information as to\n\nmatters relevant to the issues disputed.    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(d)(1).\n\n            Sempier had served his interrogatories in compliance\n\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33.    The Rule provides,\n\n\"[e]ach interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in\n\nwriting under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the\n\nobjecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall\n\nanswer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable.\"\n\nJ & H believed the interrogatories were objectionable and stated\n\nits objections.    Sempier sought to compel answers.\n\f           The court could have denied the discovery on the ground\n\nthat it was privileged, burdensome, duplicative, or otherwise\n\noutside of the scope of discovery.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).   It\n\ncould have compelled answers and awarded attorney's fees and/or\n\nsanctions.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b).   It did none of these things\n\nnor did it comply with its obligation to consider and rule upon\n\neach interrogatory to which J & H objected.     See Nestle Foods\n\nCorp. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109-112\n\n(D.N.J. 1990); Robbins v. Camden City Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-60 (D.N.J. 1983).    Rather than rule upon the objections,\n\nthe district court decided that \"[the] Magistrate Judge . . .\n\nprovided a mechanism (bill of particulars) for further discovery\n\nregarding the precise issue outlined in this Court's September 7,\n\n1993 Order.\"    App. 611.\n\n           The district court may have disliked its obligation to\n\nexamine each interrogatory and review the magistrate judge's\n\nruling.   Regardless of its feelings, the district court, guided\n\nonly by its own discretion and determination of what is important\n\nor relevant, could not rewrite a party's questions and in effect\n\nserve its own set of interrogatories.     When the court took upon\n\nitself to author the questions being asked, it virtually became a\n\nparticipant in the parties' controversy in a manner inconsistent\n\nwith fundamental conceptions of the role of a judge in our common\n\nlaw system.\n\n           In this case, the district court reformulated Sempier's\n\ninterrogatories into four broad questions about Sempier's\n\nperformance.    The magistrate judge reframed specific requests\n\fpertaining to the reasons considered by J & H, and the reasons\n\nupon which J & H actually relied to terminate Sempier, into a\n\nvague question, \"[w]hy were Plaintiff's job responsibilities\n\nreassigned?\"   Pertinent and direct interrogatories, that were\n\npropounded by Sempier, sought the dates of conversations\n\nregarding Sempier's performance and the names of the participants\n\nin those discussions.    Those interrogatories were replaced by the\n\ndistrict court with a vague and general \"Bill of Particulars.\"\n\nBecause the district court's questions were, with one exception,\n\ngeneral, nonspecific, and broad, the resulting answers, to the\n\nextent that they answered the questions at all, were\n\nuninformative and of little value.    Sempier had good reason to\n\ndraft specific interrogatories and had a right to expect\n\ncorrespondingly specific answers.    The district court's\n\nsubstitution of its own work product denied Sempier this\n\nopportunity.\n\n          We have examined the Supplemental Bill of Particulars\n\n(App. 766-772) which contains the questions framed by the\n\nmagistrate judge and the district court judge, and we have\n\nexamined closely J & H's answers.    Those answers can best be\n\ndescribed as an attempt, if not to outwit, then to frustrate all\n\nlegitimate efforts to furnish information to an adversary.10\n\nMoreover, whereas Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33 provides\n\nthat interrogatories must be answered under oath and thus may be\n\nevidentiary, there is no such provision in the Federal Rules of\n\n10\n .   See note 9 supra.\n\fCivil Procedure for a \"Bill of Particulars.\"    Indeed, there is no\n\nprovision at all for \"Bills of Particulars\" -- and for good\n\nreason.    As we have noted, \"Bills of Particulars\" were replaced\n\nby the discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nWright & Miller, supra ยง 2167.\n\n            The district court's action was unauthorized by the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and in violation of the\n\nprinciples of our jurisprudence.    The Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, which must obtain Supreme Court and Congressional\n\napproval, not only prescribe the procedures to be followed by\n\ncounsel, but they also prescribe the Rules under which the courts\n\noperate.    See Umbenhauer v. Woog, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586845\"><a href=\"/opinion/586845/richard-a-umbenhauer-trustee-in-bankruptcy-of-xouth-inc-dba-woog/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (3d Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"Neither we, the Department of State, nor the Administrative\n\nOffice of the United States Courts possess the authority to\n\ncircumvent, ignore or deviate from the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, which were approved by the Judicial Conference of the\n\nUnited States, the Supreme Court of the United States, and\n\nCongress.\")    By venturing so far outside the parameters set by\n\nthe Rules, the court abused its discretion.\n\n            Our discussion and holding here does not leave the\n\ndistrict court powerless to manage the discovery difficulties\n\npresented by this and similar cases.    On the contrary, the\n\ndistrict court has considerable authority and discretion by which\n\nto resolve discovery disputes.     Indeed, if discovery has reached\n\nan impasse or a nonproductive stage either through counsel's\n\nobstinacy, intransigence, or even incompetence, the district\n\ncourt can always, through appropriate intervention, suggest the\n\fproper manner in which questions should be asked and the answers\n\nfurnished.   A district court's creativity in this respect is\n\nunrestricted, although it cannot, of course, disregard the\n\ncommands of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, as in this\n\ncase, substitute a \"Bill of Particulars\" for a party's relevant\n\ndiscovery.   It can, however, always give counsel guidance and\n\ndirection as to the manner in which discovery should proceed.\n\n          If, after an examination of a party's interrogatories,\n\nthe district court determines that the interrogatories are\n\ninappropriate, the court can refuse to compel answers.    If a\n\nparty is unable to draft satisfactory interrogatories after a\n\nreasonable time for discovery has concluded, the court can limit\n\nfurther discovery.   If the court feels either party was acting in\n\nbad faith, it can impose sanctions.   Certainly, if a party,\n\nwithout justification, refuses to answer interrogatories in the\n\nmanner required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33, the court\n\ncan compel answers under threat of sanctions.   Any or all of\n\nthese options could have been employed in this case.     Any and all\n\nof these options would have received substantial deference upon\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n                               VII\n\n          We will reverse the summary judgment of the district\n\ncourt dated March 9, 1994 and remand.   On remand, the district\n\ncourt is directed to vacate the magistrate judge's order of\n\nAugust 7, 1993 and to vacate its own order of November 3, 1993\n\nwhich approved and modified a \"Bill of Particulars.\"     The\n\fdistrict court is also directed to permit and schedule additional\n\nappropriate and adequate discovery pursuant to the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure so that further proceedings, including trial,\n\nmay be conducted consistent with the foregoing opinion.11\n\n\n\n\n11\n . The district court's order of March 9, 1994 dismissed Counts\nFour through Six without prejudice to Sempier proceeding on those\ncounts in state court. Those counts involved state law contract\nand corporate law causes of action. The record before us is\naccordingly silent as to those matters. Nor do we know if those\nclaims are proceeding in state court. It will be for the\ndistrict court on remand to ascertain and resolve the status of\nthose claims.\n\f</pre>",
