Taylor, Leif M.\n\nMcCarthy, and Eldon L. Cooper, for failing to follow mandatory legal procedures before\n\nimposing discipline upon him for violating prison rules. He sought a writ of mandamus,\n\ndeclaratory relief, and a common-law writ of certiorari. The trial court granted a motion by\n\ndefendants to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. See 735 ILCS 5/2-615\n\n(West 2016). Plaintiff appeals.\n\n¶2             In our de novo review, we agree with the trial court that the count for declaratory\n\njudgment, count II, is legally insufficient in its entirety. We disagree, however, that the\n\fremaining two counts are legally insufficient in their entirety. Therefore, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in part and reverse it in part, and we remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n¶3                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4             In his complaint, which he filed on September 14, 2015, plaintiff alleged\n\nsubstantially as follows.\n\n\n\n¶5                                        A. The Parties\n\n¶6             Plaintiff is an inmate at Lawrence Correctional Center, in Sumner, Illinois.\n\n¶7             Gladyse C. Taylor is the Department’s director.\n\n¶8             Leif M. McCarthy is the chairperson of the adjustment committee at Lawrence\n\nCorrectional Center, the committee that hears and decides inmate disciplinary reports.\n\n¶9             Eldon L. Cooper is a member of the adjustment committee.\n\n\n\n¶ 10                   B. The Inmate Disciplinary Report Issued to Plaintiff\n\n¶ 11           On December 16, 2014, an inmate disciplinary report was served on plaintiff. In\n\nthe report, a correctional officer named “J. Harper” accused plaintiff of two offenses as defined\n\nby the Department’s regulations: security group threat or unauthorized organizational activity\n\n(20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.Appendix A (2003) (No. 205)) and intimidation or threats (id. (No.\n\n206)). The report summarized the following evidence: (1) an “accumulation of incidents”\n\nconcerning plaintiff’s “involvement with the Latin Kings Security Threat Group,” including\n\nstatements of confidential informants, one of whom identified plaintiff as chairman of the Latin\n\nKing National Regional Crown Council; (2) handwritten notes, confiscated in a shakedown, in\n\nwhich he discussed Latin King business and, in one note, expressed a desire to “kick *** down\n\n                                               -2-\n\fthe steps” someone named Kevin, who had “told Springfield a lot” about the gang; and (3)\n\nrecorded telephone conversations, in which plaintiff discussed various Latin King members who\n\nwere in prison.\n\n\n\n¶ 12                                     C. Witness Request\n\n¶ 13              On December 16, 2014, plaintiff submitted to the adjustment committee a\n\ndocument, handwritten by him, in which he requested the committee to review the “[p]hone log\n\nrecords” for May 5, September 29, and October 12, 2014. He stated that those phone records\n\nwould disprove the allegation, in the disciplinary report, that he made outgoing telephone calls\n\non those days. He also “request[ed] to be shown these alleged notes” by him, confiscated in the\n\nshakedown. Finally, he made an “inmate witness request,” listing the imprisoned Latin Kings\n\nwhom he allegedly had discussed on the telephone. He wrote: “Each inmate will testify that\n\n[plaintiff] did not order or direct any security threat group activity within [the Department] ever.”\n\n\n\n¶ 14                      D. Plaintiff’s Written Statement to the Committee\n\n¶ 15              On December 19, 2014, in the hearing on the inmate disciplinary report, plaintiff\n\npresented a handwritten statement to the committee. In this statement, he began by pleading not\n\nguilty to the two charges. Then he made essentially four points.\n\n¶ 16              First, he denied the allegation, in the disciplinary report, that he made “outside\n\ntelephone calls” on May 5, August 30, and September 29, 2014. He wrote that if only the\n\ncommittee would review the “B-Wing telephone log records,” those records would show he did\n\nnot use the telephone on those dates.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f¶ 17           Second, he insisted that if there were any recordings of his telephone calls, those\n\nrecordings, when played in their entirety, would debunk the claim that he had engaged in\n\nunauthorized organizational activity.\n\n¶ 18           Third, he denied writing the notes cited in the disciplinary report. He also denied\n\nthe notes had come from his cell, property, or person, or that there were any shakedown records\n\nindicating as much. He pointed out that Harper was not a handwriting expert.\n\n¶ 19           Fourth, he claimed the disciplinary report was untimely under the Department’s\n\nregulations because it “was written beyond the [eight] days allowed after the commission of the\n\noffense or discovery thereof.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003). He noted that the report listed\n\nthe dates of “February of 2014[;] May 5, 2014[;] July 15, 2014[;] August 30, 2014[;] September\n\nof 2014[;] October 13, 2014[;] and December 7, 2014”—all of which preceded the issuance of\n\nthe report, on December 16, 2014, by more than eight days.\n\n¶ 20           His written statement concluded with the following paragraph: “I request to see\n\nthe alleged confiscated ‘notes’ regarding the [December 16, 2014,] disciplinary report, and\n\nrequest that my December 16, 2014[,] witness and document request be reviewed and considered\n\nas exculpatory evidence by the Committee.”\n\n\n\n¶ 21                               E. The Disciplinary Hearing\n\n¶ 22           Plaintiff alleges that, in the disciplinary hearing, which was held on December 19,\n\n2014, the two members of the adjustment committee, McCarthy and Cooper, declined to show\n\nhim the notes in question and declined to personally review the notes, the telephone logs, or the\n\ntelephone recordings. As for plaintiff’s witness request, “Cooper stated that Jerry Harper (the\n\nprison official who wrote the [disciplinary report] against plaintiff) [had] directed the Committee\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fnot to call any of plaintiff’s witnesses[;] thus, no witnesses would be called.” Also, Cooper told\n\nplaintiff, in the disciplinary hearing, “that the Committee [had been] directed by higher[-]up\n\nprison authorities to find plaintiff guilty and revoke a year [of] good conduct credits and impose\n\npunitive segregation and other punitive sanctions for a year.” Upon receiving that news, plaintiff\n\n“made a verbal objection” to the committee’s lack of impartiality, but McCarthy and Cooper\n\n“refused to recuse themselves.” All this is according to plaintiff’s complaint.\n\n\n\n¶ 23                              F. The Final Summary Report\n\n¶ 24            On January 3, 2015, the Department served upon plaintiff a “Final Summary\n\nReport,” in which McCarthy and Cooper found plaintiff guilty of “Gang or Unauthorized\n\nOrganization Activity” and “Intimidation or Threats.” They recommended one year in “C grade,”\n\none year of segregation, revocation of one year of good-conduct credits, restriction for one year\n\nto $15 per month, and one year of “Contact Visits Restriction.” The chief administrative officer,\n\nStephen B. Duncan, approved the recommendation.\n\n\n\n¶ 25                                 G. Plaintiff’s Grievance\n\n¶ 26            On January 5, 2015, plaintiff administratively appealed the discipline by filing a\n\ngrievance. He complained of the committee members’ refusal to produce and personally review\n\nthe notes, telephone logs, and telephone recordings; their refusal to recuse themselves; the\n\nuntimeliness of the disciplinary report; and other irregularities, which we will discuss in greater\n\ndetail later in this opinion.\n\n¶ 27            On August 13, 2015, by adding her signature to a form, Taylor concurred with the\n\ndenial of plaintiff’s grievance. The Department “[found] no violation of the offender’s due\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fprocess in accordance with [sections 504.30 and 504.80 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30, 504.80\n\n(2003))],” to quote the check-marked preprinted language of the form. The Department was\n\n“reasonably satisfied the offender committed the offense cited in the report.”\n\n\n\n¶ 28                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 29                          A. The Request for Mandamus (Count I)\n\n¶ 30             Because the motion for dismissal was pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2016)), the question is whether the complaint states a\n\ncause of action for mandamus, declaratory relief, or a common-law writ of certiorari: the three\n\nforms of relief that plaintiff sought in the three counts of his complaint. See Johannesen v.\n\nEddins, 2011 IL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27.\n\n¶ 31             We answer that question de novo, taking the well-pleaded facts or specific factual\n\nallegations of the complaint to be true and disregarding any conclusory allegations unsupported\n\nby well-pleaded facts. Simpkins v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 2012 IL 110662, ¶ 26; Primax\n\nRecoveries, Inc. v. Atherton, 365 Ill. App. 3d 1007, 1010 (2006). Not only will we assume the\n\nwell-pleaded facts in the complaint to be true, but we will regard those facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to plaintiff. See Johannesen, 2011 IL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27. If, from the well-pleaded\n\nfacts, a reasonable inference could be drawn in plaintiff’s favor—which is to say, in favor of the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the complaint—we will draw that inference. See id. “Dismissal pursuant to\n\nsection 2-615 *** is only proper where, when construing the allegations of the complaint in the\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiff, it clearly appears that no set of facts can be proved under the\n\npleadings which will entitle the plaintiff to recover.” Armstrong v. Snyder, 336 Ill. App. 3d 567,\n\n568-69 (2003).\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f¶ 32           With those ground rules in mind, we first evaluate the legal sufficiency of count I,\n\nthe count seeking mandamus. By its factual allegations, count I must establish three propositions.\n\nFirst, under the law, plaintiff has a clear right to the performance of the ministerial act that he\n\nseeks to compel the public officer to perform. See Burris v. White, 232 Ill. 2d 1, 7 (2009);\n\nBaldacchino v. Thompson, 289 Ill. App. 3d 104, 109 (1997). Second, plaintiff demanded that the\n\npublic officer perform the act (unless such a demand would have been futile), and the public\n\nofficer refused to do so. See Eley v. Cahill, 126 Ill. App. 2d 272, 276-77 (1970). Third, the public\n\nofficer has clear authority to comply with the proposed writ of mandamus. See Burris, 232 Ill. 2d\n\nat 7.\n\n¶ 33           Plaintiff argues that defendants have both authority and a duty to comply with the\n\nDepartment’s regulations. We do not understand defendants as disputing that argument.\n\n“Administrative regulations have the force and effect of law” (People v. Bonutti, 212 Ill. 2d 182,\n\n188 (2004)), and a prisoner may file a complaint for mandamus to compel correctional officers to\n\nperform nondiscretionary duties laid down in the Department’s regulations (West v. Gramley,\n\n262 Ill. App. 3d 552, 557 (1994); Shea v. Edwards, 221 Ill. App. 3d 219, 221 (1991); Taylor v.\n\nFranzen, 93 Ill. App. 3d 758, 765 (1981))—assuming the prisoner has a substantial personal\n\ninterest in the matter (see Warden v. Byrne, 102 Ill. App. 3d 501, 506 (1981); North v. Board of\n\nTrustees of the University of Illinois, 137 Ill. 296, 301 (1891)).\n\n¶ 34           Citing several paragraphs of his complaint, plaintiff argues he specifically alleged\n\nviolations of the Department’s regulations and that mandamus should compel compliance with\n\nthese regulations. We will discuss the alleged violations one by one.\n\n\n\n¶ 35           1. Review of the Inmate Disciplinary Report by a Hearing Investigator\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f¶ 36           Under section 504.60(a), “[t]he Chief Administrative Officer shall appoint one or\n\nmore Hearing Investigators[,] who shall review all major disciplinary reports.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.60(a) (2003). Plaintiff claims the Department violated this\n\nsection. In support of his claim, he references the inmate disciplinary report, a copy of which is\n\nattached to his complaint as exhibit A: in the report, the box next to “Hearing Investigator’s\n\nReview Required” is blank, as is the line for the hearing officer’s signature.\n\n¶ 37           Evidently, judging by exhibit A, the Department decided a hearing investigator’s\n\nreview was not required in this case. Necessarily, that decision entailed the exercise of judgment,\n\nbecause a hearing investigator’s review was required only for “major” disciplinary reports, and it\n\nwas a matter of judgment whether a disciplinary report was “major.” Id.\n\n¶ 38           No doubt, plaintiff would regard that decision as a misjudgment or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, but the conscientiousness of the exercise of judgment or discretion is beside the point.\n\nThe question is not whether the exercise of judgment or discretion was sound; the question is\n\nwhether the exercise of judgment or discretion was required. Mandamus “will not be granted\n\nwhen the act in question involves the exercise of discretion.” (Emphasis in original.) The Y-Not\n\nProject, Ltd. v. Fox Waterway Agency, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35. The act that the plaintiff\n\nseeks to compel in a mandamus action must be purely ministerial in nature, involving no use of\n\njudgment. Id. This act involved the use of judgment. Thus, with respect to the omission of a\n\nhearing investigator’s review, plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 39                       2. Failure To Serve the Disciplinary Report\n                           Upon Plaintiff by the Regulatory Deadline\n\n¶ 40           Section 504.30(f) provides as follows: “Service of a disciplinary report upon the\n\noffender shall commence the disciplinary proceeding. In no event shall a disciplinary report ***\n\n                                                -8-\n\fbe served upon an adult offender more than [eight] days *** after the commission of an offense\n\nor the discovery thereof unless the offender is unavailable or unable to participate in the\n\nproceeding.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003).\n\n¶ 41           Plaintiff alleges the disciplinary report was issued on December 16, 2014, and that\n\nthe disciplinary report “lists incident dates of February of 2014; May 5, 2014; July 15, 2014;\n\nAugust 30, 2014; September of 2014; October 13, 2014[;] [and] December 7, 2014”—all of\n\nwhich predate the issuance of the disciplinary report by more than eight days. Obviously, the\n\ndisciplinary report could not have been served upon him before it was issued. He argues that,\n\nbecause of the Department’s failure to meet the eight-day deadline for serving the disciplinary\n\nreport on him, the Department has a clear duty, under section 504.30(f), to withdraw the\n\ndisciplinary report and the associated penalties. See id.\n\n¶ 42           Even this eight-day deadline, however, requires the exercise of judgment or\n\ndiscretion: “In no event shall a disciplinary report *** be served upon an adult offender more\n\nthan [eight] days *** after the commission of an offense or the discovery thereof unless the\n\noffender is unavailable or unable to participate in the proceeding.” (Emphasis added.) Id. It\n\nrequires judgment to determine whether and when an offense was committed. An evaluation\n\nmust be performed. The Department must compare the known facts with the elements of the\n\noffense and must reach a conclusion. For that matter, it requires judgment to determine whether\n\nthe offender is able to participate in the proceeding. No doubt plaintiff would argue that\n\njudgment, under these circumstances, could have been soundly exercised in only one way. Even\n\nso, judgment had to be exercised. It follows that the Department’s duty under section 504.30(f) is\n\nnot purely ministerial and that, with respect to the alleged noncompliance with the eight-day\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fdeadline in that section, plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus. See Fox Waterway,\n\n2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n\n\n¶ 43                      3. Failure To Provide a Written Reason for Denying\n                      Plaintiff’s Request for the In-Person Testimony of Witnesses\n\n¶ 44               Plaintiff claims the Department violated section 504.80(h)(4) of its regulations\n\n(20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(h)(4) (2003)) by failing to provide a written reason for denying his\n\nrequest for the in-person testimony of witnesses at his disciplinary hearing.\n\n¶ 45               Defendants respond that plaintiff failed to fulfill a procedural precondition. They\n\nobserve that, under section 504.80(f)(2) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2) (2003)), “[t]he [witness]\n\nrequest [had to] be in writing on the space provided in the disciplinary report” and that the\n\nrequest had to “include an explanation of what the witnesses would state.” Instead of using the\n\ndesignated space in the disciplinary report to request witnesses, plaintiff used a separate sheet of\n\npaper, and he did not explain what the witnesses would state. On the authority of Taylor v. Frey,\n\n406 Ill. App. 3d 1112, 1118 (2011), defendants argue the Department was within its discretion to\n\nrefuse to hear witnesses, given that plaintiff never requested them in the manner that subsection\n\n(f)(2) required.\n\n¶ 46               To clarify, under the Department’s regulation, there are two kinds of requests for\n\nwitnesses: a request for the prehearing interview of witnesses (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2)\n\n(2003)) and a request for the in-person testimony of witnesses in the disciplinary hearing (20 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code 504.80(h)(3) (2003)). It is unclear which kind of witness request plaintiff intended to\n\nmake. Was he requesting a prehearing interview of the witnesses pursuant to subsection (f)(2), or\n\nwas he requesting the in-person testimony of the witnesses pursuant to subsection (h)(3)? In his\n\nrequest, a copy of which is attached to the complaint as exhibit B, he confusingly cited both\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\fsubsection (f)(2) and subsection (h)(3). If he meant to request the prehearing interview of\n\nwitnesses pursuant to subsection (f)(2), he would have had to do so in the space provided in the\n\ndisciplinary report (see 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2) (2003) (“The request shall be in writing\n\non the space provided in the disciplinary report and shall include an explanation of what the\n\nwitnesses would state.”)). He did not do so. Whether that omission was problematic depended on\n\nwhich kind of witness request he was making—and, in that respect, his witness request was\n\nunclear. His request did not specifically say what he wanted the Department to do: interview the\n\nwitnesses ahead of time or arrange for their attendance in the disciplinary hearing, and as we\n\nnoted, his request cited both subsection (f)(2) and subsection (h)(3).\n\n¶ 47           Because of this ambiguity in his request, the Department had no “clear duty” to\n\nprovide a written reason for denying the request. Orenic v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board,\n\n127 Ill. 2d 453, 467-68 (1989). That duty under section 504.80(h)(4) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(h)(4) (2003)) would have kicked in only if plaintiff requested the in-person attendance of\n\nwitnesses. It is unclear if he did so. Therefore, the Department had no clear duty, under section\n\n504.80(h)(4), to provide a written reason for the denial. It follows that, with respect to the\n\nDepartment’s alleged failure to provide a written reason for denying the in-person attendance of\n\nwitnesses (see id.), plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 48                    4. Failure To Place Plaintiff Under Investigation\n\n¶ 49           Plaintiff claims the Department violated section 504.30(e) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.30(e) (2003)) in that the Department “never placed [him] under investigation.” That section\n\nprovides: “If an offender is suspected of committing a disciplinary offense, an investigative\n\ndisciplinary report, hereinafter referred to as an investigative report, may be issued that\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\freasonably informs the offender of the subject of the investigation to the extent that safety and\n\nsecurity allow.” (Emphasis added.) Id. Because the word “may” calls for an exercise of\n\ndiscretion (Krautsack v. Anderson, 223 Ill. 2d 541, 554 (2006)), and because mandamus may\n\ncompel the performance of only a nondiscretionary, ministerial duty (Fox Waterway, 2016 IL\n\nApp (2d) 150502, ¶ 35), we conclude that, with respect to the alleged violation of section\n\n504.30(e), plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 50                     5. The Committee’s Failure To Independently Review\n                           the Notes and the Telephone Logs and Recordings\n\n¶ 51           Plaintiff claims the committee members violated section 504.80(g) (20 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 504.80(g) (2003)) by failing to independently review the notes and the telephone logs and\n\nrecordings, as opposed to relying merely on summaries and quotations provided by other\n\ncorrectional officers.\n\n¶ 52           Section 504.80(g) consists of a single sentence, which reads as follows: “The\n\nCommittee shall consider all material presented that is relevant to the issue of whether or not the\n\noffender committed the offense.” Id. It requires an exercise of judgment to determine which\n\nmaterials are relevant—even if relevance should be obvious. Therefore, with respect to the\n\nalleged violation of section 504.80(g), plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus. See\n\nFox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n¶ 53           In so holding, we acknowledge the federal cases that plaintiff cites. Those cases\n\nfound a due-process violation (or at least an arguable due-process violation) in the refusal of a\n\nprison disciplinary tribunal to produce incriminating documents allegedly written by the prisoner\n\n(Young v. Kann, 926 F.2d 1396, 1397 (3d Cir. 1991); Scarpa v. Ponte, 638 F. Supp. 1019, 1023\n\n(D. Mass. 1986)) or in the refusal to review primary evidentiary materials as opposed to\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\fsecondhand summaries of those materials (McIntosh v. Carter, 578 F. Supp. 96, 98 (W.D. Ky.\n\n1983)). For two reasons, however, we find those federal cases to be inapposite. First, decisions of\n\nthe United States District Court and the Court of Appeals do not establish Illinois law (see\n\nPeople v. Pitzman, 293 Ill. App. 3d 282, 291 (1997)), and, thus, they do not establish a “clear\n\nduty” on the part of defendants (Burris, 232 Ill. 2d at 7). Second, none of those federal cases\n\nsought mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 54                    6. The Committee’s Refusal To Produce the Notes\n\n¶ 55           Plaintiff alleges that, both before and during the disciplinary hearing, he requested\n\nto see the notes he allegedly had written and that the Department denied those requests, thereby\n\nviolating section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)).\n\n¶ 56           Under section 504.80(f)(1), “[t]he offender may *** produce any relevant\n\ndocuments in his or her defense.” Id. Thus, instead of having the right to present any and all\n\ndocuments in his or her defense, the offender has a right to present only “relevant” documents in\n\nhis or her defense. Id. To decide whether a document is presentable in the disciplinary hearing,\n\nthe Department has to decide whether it is relevant. Because the determination of relevancy\n\nrequires an exercise of judgment, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus with\n\nrespect to the alleged violation of section 504.80(f)(1). See Fox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d)\n\n150502, ¶ 35. Again, it does not matter if judgment could have been reasonably exercised in only\n\none way; judgment is judgment.\n\n\n\n¶ 57               7. The Committee Members’ Refusal To Recuse Themselves\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f¶ 58           Plaintiff argues the committee members should have recused themselves because,\n\nhaving been directed by higher-up prison authorities to find him guilty and to impose particular\n\npenalties, they lacked impartiality.\n\n¶ 59           The asserted duty of recusal, however, would not have been a ministerial duty.\n\nRather, the committee members would have had to perform a legal evaluation: they would have\n\nhad to judge whether, in the light of relevant case law, the alleged directive from above\n\ndisqualified them from being impartial hearing officers. Therefore, with respect to their refusal to\n\nrecuse themselves, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus. See Fox Waterway,\n\n2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n\n\n¶ 60           8. Failure To Follow a Required Procedure After a Prisoner Objects to\n                Committee Members on the Ground of Their Lack of Impartiality\n\n¶ 61           In his complaint, plaintiff makes the following factual allegations, which, again,\n\nfor purposes of section 2-615, we assume to be true. See Schweihs, 2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27. In the\n\ndisciplinary hearing, one of the defendants, Eldon L. Cooper, who was a member of the\n\nadjustment committee, told plaintiff “that the Committee [had been] directed by higher[-]up\n\nprison authorities to find plaintiff guilty and revoke a year[’s] good conduct credit and impose\n\npunitive segregation and other punitive sanctions for a year.” Plaintiff immediately made a\n\nverbal objection to the committee members’ lack of impartiality, but they refused to recuse\n\nthemselves. Afterward, in its final summary report, the committee made no mention of plaintiff’s\n\nobjection to the committee members’ lack of impartiality.\n\n¶ 62           Plaintiff argues this omission violated section 504.80(d) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(d) (2003)), which provides as follows: “Any person *** who is *** not impartial shall\n\nnot serve on the Adjustment Committee hearing that disciplinary report. An offender who objects\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fto a member of the Committee based on a lack of impartiality must raise the matter at the\n\nbeginning of the hearing. The Committee shall document the basis of the objection and the\n\ndecision in the Adjustment Committee summary.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 63           Plaintiff alleged he made a timely objection to the committee members’ lack of\n\nimpartiality, and the committee had a clear, nondiscretionary duty, under section 504.80(d), to\n\n“document the basis of the objection and the decision in the Adjustment Committee summary.”\n\nId. In the grievance that plaintiff filed on January 5, 2015, one of his complaints was that the\n\ncommittee had “arbitrarily failed to document [his] objections concerning the Committee[’s] not\n\nbeing impartial, in violation of [section] 504.80(d).” The Department denied his grievance.\n\nTherefore, in this context, all the elements of mandamus are present: “a clear right to relief, a\n\nclear duty of the public official to act, and a clear authority in the public official to comply with\n\nthe [proposed] writ.” Burris, 232 Ill. 2d at 7. With respect to the Department’s noncompliance\n\nwith section 504.80(d), plaintiff states a cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 64            9. Failure To Include a Summary of Plaintiff’s Written Statement\n\n¶ 65           Section 504.80(l)(1) provides as follows:\n\n                       “l) A written record shall be prepared and signed by all members of the\n\n               Committee that contains:\n\n                               1) A summary of oral and written statements and other evidence\n\n                       presented.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(l)(1) (2003).\n\nSubsection (o) provides: “A copy of the disciplinary report and Adjustment Committee summary\n\nshall be forwarded to the Chief Administrative Officer for review and approval and a copy shall\n\nbe filed in the offender’s record.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(o) (2003). Apparently, the summary\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fof the offender’s written statement is part of what the “Chief Administrative Officer” would\n\nreview in deciding whether to approve the “Adjustment Committee dispositions.” 20 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 504.80(p) (2003).\n\n¶ 66           Plaintiff alleges that although, in the disciplinary hearing, he submitted to the\n\nadjustment committee a written statement (exhibit C of the complaint), the committee’s final\n\nsummary report (exhibit D) lacks a summary of his written statement. Plaintiff subsequently\n\ncomplained, in his grievance (exhibit E), that the committee had “failed to give a summary of\n\n[his] written statement, in violation of [section] 504.80(l)(1),” but the Department denied his\n\ngrievance.\n\n¶ 67           Because the committee members had a clear ministerial duty to include, in the\n\nadministrative record, signed by them, a summary of plaintiff’s written statement (see 20 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code 504.80(l)(1) (2003)), plaintiff states a cause of action for mandamus in this respect.\n\nSee Fox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35; Thompson v. Lane, 194 Ill. App. 3d 855,\n\n863 (1990) (this regulatory requirement of summarizing all the evidence, including the oral and\n\nwritten statements, “is not to be taken lightly”).\n\n\n\n¶ 68                  B. The Request for a Declaratory Judgment (Count II)\n\n¶ 69           We have held that an action for a common-law writ of certiorari, instead of an\n\naction for a declaratory judgment, is the correct means by which to seek the review of penalties\n\nimposed in a prison disciplinary proceeding. Alicea v. Snyder, 321 Ill. App. 3d 248, 253 (2001).\n\nTherefore, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for a declaratory judgment. See id.\n\n\n\n¶ 70            C. The Request for a Common-Law Writ of Certiorari (Count III)\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f¶ 71               1. The Availability of a Common-Law Action for Certiorari\n\n¶ 72           If an administrative agency issues a quasi-judicial decision (McKeown v. Moore,\n\n303 Ill. 448, 453 (1922)) and the statute conferring power on the agency does not adopt the\n\nAdministrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. (West 2014)) or provide any other\n\nmethod of judicial review, the decision is reviewable in an action for a common-law writ of\n\ncertiorari (Hanrahan v. Williams, 174 Ill. 2d 268, 272 (1996)). Because the statutory provisions\n\npertaining to prison disciplinary procedures (730 ILCS 5/3-8-7 to 3-8-10 (West 2014)) neither\n\nadopt the Administrative Review Law nor provide any other method of judicial review, prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings are reviewable in an action for certiorari. Alicea, 321 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n253.\n\n\n\n¶ 73                 2. The Nature of a Common-Law Action for Certiorari\n\n¶ 74           Whereas mandamus compels a governmental official to perform a ministerial act,\n\na common-law writ of certiorari “bring[s] before the court issuing it the record of the inferior\n\ntribunal for review.” Barden v. Junior College District No. 520, 132 Ill. App. 2d 1038, 1038\n\n(1971); see also People ex rel. Elmore v. Allman, 382 Ill. 156, 160 (1943). The circuit court will\n\nissue a writ of certiorari to the agency, and within the time specified in the writ (see Murphy v.\n\nCuesta, Rey & Co., 381 Ill. 162, 168 (1942)), the agency must provide the court with the record\n\nof the administrative proceedings so that the court can determine from the record—and only\n\nfrom the record (Reichert v. Court of Claims, 203 Ill. 2d 257, 260 (2003); Goodfriend v. Board of\n\nAppeals, 18 Ill. App. 3d 412, 418-19 (1973))—whether the agency acted within its statutory\n\nauthority and in accordance with the law (Funkhouser v. Coffin, 301 Ill. 257, 260 (1921);\n\nGoodfriend, 18 Ill. App. 3d at 418-19). The burden will be on the agency to provide a record\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 -\n\fadequate to that purpose: a record consisting of facts, not mere conclusions (Funkhouser, 301 Ill.\n\nat 261). Frye v. Hunt, 365 Ill. 32, 37 (1936) (“Where the question is whether jurisdictional facts\n\nwere established, mere conclusions of law are insufficient and the record must show the\n\nexistence of the facts required to authorize the inferior tribunal or officer to act, and this evidence\n\nmay properly be reviewed by the court.”); Funkhouser, 301 Ill. at 264 (“The record made on the\n\nreturn of the writ failing to show any facts upon which [the] removal [of the appellee from his\n\nmunicipal employment] was justified, the trial court erred in quashing the writ and in not\n\ngranting the motion of the appellee to quash the original [(administrative)] proceedings [for his\n\nremoval].”).\n\n¶ 75           After reviewing the record from the inferior tribunal, the trial court should enter\n\neither of two judgments. If, from the record, it appears that the inferior tribunal lacked\n\njurisdiction or that its actions were inconsistent with the law, the court may quash the\n\nproceedings of the inferior tribunal. Goodfriend, 18 Ill. App. 3d at 419. Alternatively, if, from the\n\nrecord, it appears that the inferior tribunal had jurisdiction and that its actions were consistent\n\nwith the law, the court should dismiss the certiorari count and quash the writ. Id.\n\n\n\n¶ 76                               3. The Pleading Requirements\n\n¶ 77           A petition for a common-law writ of certiorari must allege “good cause” for the\n\nissuance of a writ (City of Chicago v. Condell, 224 Ill. 595, 597 (1906)): the petition must allege\n\nthat the inferior tribunal or the agency exercising a quasi-judicial function (Reichert, 203 Ill. 2d\n\nat 260) failed to comply with the law or exceeded its authority (City of Kankakee v. Department\n\nof Revenue, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14), with the result that the petitioner suffered\n\n“substantial injury or injustice” (Stratton v. Wenona Community Unit District No. 1, 133 Ill. 2d\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f413, 428 (1990)). If the plaintiff (1) was a party to the administrative proceeding (Board of\n\nEducation of Woodland Community Consolidated School District 50 v. Illinois State Charter\n\nSchool Comm’n, 2016 IL App (1st) 151372, ¶ 39); (2) was substantially injured by the agency’s\n\nfailure to follow an essential procedural requirement applicable to such a proceeding (id.; C&K\n\nDistributors, Inc. v. Hynes, 122 Ill. App. 3d 525, 528 (1984)); and (3) has no other method of\n\nreview (Outcom, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 233 Ill. 2d 324, 333 (2009)), the\n\nplaintiff has a cause of action for certiorari.\n\n¶ 78            Taking the well-pleaded facts of the complaint to be true (see Schweihs, 2016 IL\n\n120041, ¶ 27), as opposed to conclusions, which we disregard (see Johannesen, 2011 IL App\n\n(2d) 110108, ¶ 27), and resolving all reasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor (see Schweihs,\n\n2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27; Johannesen, 2011 IL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27), we see two failures to\n\ncomply with law that arguably caused substantial injury or injustice to him.\n\n\n\n¶ 79                        4. Refusal To Produce the Notes in Question\n\n¶ 80            First, plaintiff alleges that, both before and during the disciplinary hearing, he\n\nrequested to see the notes he allegedly had written. In exhibit B of the complaint, addressed to\n\nthe adjustment committee and dated December 16, 2014, plaintiff stated: “I request to be shown\n\nthe alleged ‘notes.’ ” In exhibit C of the complaint, likewise addressed to the adjustment\n\ncommittee and dated December 19, 2014, he cited section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(f)(1) (2003)) and stated: “I request to see the alleged confiscated ‘notes’ regarding the\n\n12-16-14 disciplinary report, and request that my December 16, 2014[,] witness and document\n\nrequest be reviewed and considered as exculpatory evidence by the Committee.” Without\n\nexplanation, the committee refused to produce the notes in the disciplinary hearing, or so\n\n\n\n                                                  - 19 -\n\fplaintiff alleges in his complaint. Afterward, in his grievance, plaintiff complained: “The\n\nCommittee arbitrarily failed to review or allow me to review the alleged ‘notes’ stated in the 12-\n\n16-14 [inmate disciplinary report].” The Department denied the grievance, “find[ing] no\n\nviolation of the offender’s due process in accordance with [sections 504.80 (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80 (2003)) and 504.30 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30 (2003))].”\n\n¶ 81           Under section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)), “[t]he\n\noffender may *** produce any relevant documents in his or her defense.” Thus, the Department\n\nhad a duty to allow plaintiff to produce any relevant documents in his defense. Given that the\n\ndisciplinary report cited the notes as evidence against plaintiff, it would be untenable to\n\ncharacterize the notes as irrelevant. The Department was required to follow its own regulations\n\n(see Thompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 860), and it was the Department’s duty, under section\n\n504.80(f)(1), to allow plaintiff to “produce” the notes in his own defense. 20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(f)(1) (2003). One of the meanings of “produce” is to “show *** (something) for\n\nconsideration” or “inspection.” The New Oxford American Dictionary 1359 (2001). If, in his\n\nown defense, plaintiff wanted to show the notes in question, to prove he was not their author, and\n\nif the Department had exclusive possession of the notes and refused to relinquish them for his\n\nuse in the disciplinary hearing, the Department violated its regulatory duty to allow plaintiff to\n\n“produce any relevant documents in his *** defense” (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)).\n\nSee also Thompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 859 (one of the due-process rights of a prisoner in a\n\nprison disciplinary proceeding is to “present documentary evidence in his defense”). The alleged\n\nviolation of section 504.80(f)(1) is significant and in itself would justify the issuance of a\n\ncommon-law writ of certiorari. See Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d at 428; Condell, 224 Ill. at 597; City of\n\nKankakee, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14; Tanner v. Court of Claims, 256 Ill. App. 3d 1089,\n\n\n\n                                              - 20 -\n\f1092 (1994) (“Where a plaintiff brings into issue the alleged violation of his procedural and\n\nsubstantive rights, the petition is not subject to dismissal, as such issue cannot be determined as a\n\nmatter of law upon the bare allegations of the petition.”).\n\n¶ 82           In response to a writ of certiorari, the Department should be required to produce\n\nan administrative record showing that, contrary to plaintiff’s allegation (which, for purposes of\n\nthe motion for dismissal, we take as true (see Schweihs, 2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27)), the Department\n\nproduced the notes in question so that plaintiff could use them, in his own defense, in the\n\ndisciplinary hearing.\n\n\n\n¶ 83            5. The Refusal of the Committee Members To Recuse Themselves\n\n¶ 84           Second, plaintiff alleges the committee members should have recused themselves\n\nbecause, having been directed by higher-up prison authorities to find him guilty and to impose\n\nparticular penalties, they lacked impartiality. In a disciplinary hearing, the prisoner has a due-\n\nprocess right to, among other things, an impartial hearing officer. Epstein v. Lane, 189 Ill. App.\n\n3d 63, 64 (1989).\n\n¶ 85           We begin with the presumption that the members of the adjustment committee\n\nwere “objective and capable of fairly judging the issues.” Hurst v. Department of Employment\n\nSecurity, 393 Ill. App. 3d 323, 330 (2009). Like all presumptions, however, that presumption is\n\nrebuttable. “Bias or prejudice may *** be shown if a disinterested observer might conclude that\n\nthe official had in some measure adjudged the facts as well as the law of the case in advance of\n\nhearing it.” Id. Taking the well-pleaded facts of the complaint to be true and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor (see Schweihs, 2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27; Johannesen, 2011\n\nIL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27), a disinterested observer might conclude that the members of the\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\fadjustment committee had prejudged the case before hearing it, considering it is alleged that (1)\n\nthey personally examined none of the primary evidentiary materials; (2) Cooper told plaintiff, in\n\nthe hearing, that their superiors had ordered them to find him guilty and to impose certain\n\npenalties; and (3) they then found him guilty and imposed precisely the penalties their superiors\n\nhad ordered them to impose. Given the factual allegations of the complaint, which our standard\n\nof review obliges us to take as true, the impartiality of the administrative tribunal is sufficiently\n\nin question that good cause exists for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. See Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d\n\nat 428; Condell, 224 Ill. at 597; City of Kankakee, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14; Tanner, 256\n\nIll. App. 3d at 1092.\n\n¶ 86           This claim of bias should not take the Department by surprise. In his grievance,\n\ndefendant stated: “[Correctional Officer] Cooper *** stated that the committee was told to give\n\nme a year across the board and find me guilty. I made verbal objections to the committee not\n\nbeing impartial.” This was a serious allegation, which plaintiff formally made in a grievance, and\n\none would expect the administrative record to contain a rebuttal, considering that Taylor denied\n\nthe grievance. In response to a writ of certiorari, the Department should produce this record.\n\n\n\n¶ 87             6. The Eight-Day Deadline for Serving the Disciplinary Report\n\n¶ 88            Additionally, in his count for certiorari, plaintiff alleges the Department violated\n\nsection 504.30(f) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003)) in that “[t]he December 16, 2014, [inmate\n\ndisciplinary report] was written beyond the statutory eight (8) days allowed after the incident.”\n\nSpecifically, he alleges the disciplinary report was written (and therefore served upon him) more\n\nthan eight days after the final evidentiary incident listed in the disciplinary report, namely, the\n\ntelephone call of December 7, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f¶ 89           That is not enough, however, to establish a violation of the regulation. Plaintiff\n\nmust plead facts that would, if proved, establish the Department’s noncompliance with the eight-\n\nday deadline in section 504.30(f) (see Teter v. Clemens, 112 Ill. 2d 252, 256 (1986)), and merely\n\nby proving that the Department served the disciplinary report on him more than eight days after\n\nthe final telephone call, plaintiff would not prove noncompliance with the eight-day deadline.\n\n¶ 90           In concluding that plaintiff committed the offense of security group threat or\n\nunauthorized organization activity, the Department relied not only on the telephone calls, but\n\nalso on statements by confidential informants. We do not know when the Department\n\ninterviewed these confidential informants. The Department could have done so the day before\n\nserving the disciplinary report on plaintiff. Likewise, for purposes of the offense of intimidation,\n\nwe do not know when the Department came into the possession of a handwriting sample by\n\nplaintiff, to compare it with the note that Harper had confiscated in the shakedown. For all we\n\nknow, the Department made the comparison the day before serving the disciplinary report on\n\nplaintiff. Therefore, with respect to the alleged failure to meet the eight-day deadline in section\n\n504.30(f), plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action for a common-law writ of certiorari.\n\n\n\n¶ 91                     D. The Rationale for the Motion for Dismissal:\n                      the Suggestion That the Illinois Administrative Code\n                                Confers No Rights on Prisoners\n\n¶ 92           In support of its motion for dismissal, the State cited Ashley v. Snyder, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 1252, 1258 (2000), and two cases that relied on Ashley: Duane v. Hardy, 2012 IL App\n\n(3d) 110845, ¶ 15, and Dupree v. Hardy, 2011 IL App (4th) 100351, ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 93           In Ashley, a correctional center in which the plaintiff was imprisoned issued a\n\npolicy-revising bulletin, which lessened the amount of personal property that inmates were\n\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\fpermitted to keep in their cells. Previously, an orientation manual permitted inmates to keep\n\nmore personal property. Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1254. The plaintiff contended that the bulletin\n\nviolated various provisions of the United States and Illinois Constitutions, as well as several state\n\nand federal statutes. Id. at 1253.\n\n¶ 94           One of the plaintiff’s constitutional contentions was that the bulletin deprived him\n\nof property without the due process of law. Id. at 1255. We rejected that contention because, in\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 477-84 (1995), the Supreme Court had held that, for purposes\n\nof the due-process clause (U.S. Const., amend. XIV), states could not “create enforceable liberty\n\ninterests in freedom from the routine deprivations and discomforts of prison life.” Ashley, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1255. Although, for the benefit of prisoners, states could “ ‘create liberty interests ***\n\nprotected by the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause,’ ” those interests would “ ‘generally [be] limited to\n\nfreedom from restraint which *** imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 1255-56 (quoting\n\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484). Restricting the amount of personal property inmates could keep in their\n\ncells did not qualify as an atypical and significant hardship, and, thus, for purposes of due\n\nprocess, such a restriction did “not impact a protected liberty interest.” Id. at 1256.\n\n¶ 95           We likewise rejected the plaintiff’s other constitutional theories. The bulletin did\n\nnot change the definition of his crime or create any risk of increasing the punishment for his\n\ncrime, and hence the ex post facto clause (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 16) was irrelevant. Ashley,\n\n316 Ill. App. 3d at 1257. The bulletin was not an unreasonable seizure under the fourth\n\namendment (U.S. Const., amend. IV), because the fourth amendment was inapplicable in prison\n\ncells. Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1257. Nor did the bulletin violate the eighth amendment (U.S.\n\nConst., amend. VIII); limiting the amount of property that inmates could keep in their cells was\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\fpart of the penalty that criminal offenders typically had to pay for their offenses. Ashley, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1257.\n\n¶ 96           We also were unconvinced that statutory law lent any support to the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim. Rather, section 3-4-3 of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/3-4-3 (West 1998))\n\nexplicitly contemplated that inmates would “ ‘not [be] allowed’ ” to keep some “ ‘personal\n\nproperty.’ ” Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258 (quoting 730 ILCS 5/3-4-3 (West 1998)).\n\n¶ 97           Those holdings rightly disposed of all the constitutional and statutory claims that\n\nthe plaintiff had raised in Ashley. Nevertheless, in an “epilogue,” we added:\n\n                       “In so holding, we note that this sort of ‘prisoner’s rights’ case depletes\n\n               the resources of prosecutors, the judiciary, and [the Department], and\n\n               unnecessarily diverts [the Department’s] attention from ensuring that prisoners\n\n               are granted their genuine rights. Prison regulations, such as those contained in the\n\n               inmate orientation manual relied on here, were never intended to confer rights on\n\n               inmates or serve as a basis for constitutional claims. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482***.\n\n               Instead, Illinois [Department] regulations, as well as the Unified Code, were\n\n               designed to provide guidance to prison officials in the administration of prisons.\n\n               In addition, Illinois law creates no more rights for inmates than those which are\n\n               constitutionally required.\n\n                       ***\n\n                       *** Inmates thus have a constitutional right to adequate shelter, food,\n\n               drinking water, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety. [Citations.]\n\n               Prisoners also have a reasonable right of access to courts and a right to a\n\n               reasonable opportunity to exercise religious freedom under the first amendment.\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f               [Citation.] Beyond these, prisoners possess no other rights, only privileges.”\n\n               (Emphases in original.) Id. at 1258-59.\n\n¶ 98           It is true that “[p]rison regulations” of the type represented by the inmate\n\norientation manual confer no rights on inmates (id. at 1258), but that is because bulletins,\n\nhandbooks, and similar materials are not the Illinois Administrative Code (see Lucas v.\n\nDepartment of Corrections, 2012 IL App (4th) 110004, ¶ 14). A procedural operating manual is\n\n“designed to provide guidance” (Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258), but the Illinois Administrative\n\nCode is different: it is more than guidance; it has “the force and effect of law” (People ex rel.\n\nMadigan v. Illinois Commerce Comm’n, 231 Ill. 2d 370, 380 (2008); People v. Montalvo, 2016\n\nIL App (2d) 140905, ¶ 18). To say that “Illinois law,” including the Illinois Administrative Code,\n\n“creates no more rights for inmates than those which are constitutionally required” would be to\n\nsay that, for inmates, Illinois law is redundant and superfluous—it might as well not exist for\n\nthem. (Emphasis in original.) Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258. Not only is that statement\n\nunsupported by citation to any authority, but it is irreconcilable with case law preceding Ashley.\n\nIt had always been the law that, in prison disciplinary proceedings, the Department had to follow\n\nits own promulgated regulations (Clayton-El v. Lane, 203 Ill. App. 3d 895, 899 (1990);\n\nThompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 860; People ex rel. Yoder v. Hardy, 116 Ill. App. 3d 489, 495\n\n(1983)) and that inmates could sue to compel correctional officers to perform nondiscretionary\n\nduties set forth in the Department’s regulations (West, 262 Ill. App. 3d at 557; Shea, 221 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 221; Taylor, 93 Ill. App. 3d at 765). To the extent that Ashley suggests otherwise, we\n\ndecline to follow Ashley.\n\n¶ 99           It is true that, for purposes of constitutional due process, the liberty interests that\n\nstate statutes create are “generally limited to freedom from restraint which *** imposes atypical\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\fand significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484. That does not mean, however, that it is impossible for a state statute to\n\ncreate other, nonconstitutional rights for inmates, enforceable by mandamus. Several years after\n\nthe issuance of Ashley, in an original mandamus action brought by a prisoner (see Ill. S. Ct. R.\n\n381(c) (eff. Mar. 1, 2001)), the supreme court described the elements of mandamus as follows:\n\n                       “Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy to enforce, as a matter of right, the\n\n               performance of official duties by a public officer where no exercise of discretion\n\n               on his part is involved. *** [Citation.] To obtain relief, a plaintiff must establish a\n\n               clear right to mandamus. [Citation.] Mandamus is improper where its effect is to\n\n               substitute the court’s judgment or discretion for that of the body which is\n\n               commanded to act. *** [Citation.] Consequently, we will not grant mandamus\n\n               relief unless the plaintiff has clearly shown: (1) an affirmative right to relief; (2)\n\n               defendant’s duty to act; and (3) defendant’s authority to comply with the order.\n\n               [Citation.]” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Holly v. Montes, 231 Ill. 2d 153,\n\n               159 (2008).\n\nNotably absent from this description of mandamus is any requirement that the plaintiff-prisoner’s\n\n“affirmative right to relief” be constitutional. Id. The prisoner in Holly contended that, under\n\nboth statutory law and the due-process clause (whether of the Illinois Constitution or the United\n\nStates Constitution or both is unspecified), he had a clear right to mandatory supervised release\n\nthat was free of the condition of electronic home monitoring. Id. at 156. If, as we had held in\n\nAshley, “Illinois law create[d] no more rights for inmates than those which [were]\n\nconstitutionally required” (emphasis in original) (Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258), the plaintiff’s\n\nstatutory argument would have been superfluous, and the supreme court could have proceeded\n\n\n\n                                               - 27 -\n\fdirectly to his alternative, constitutional theory. But the supreme court painstakingly construed\n\nthe relevant statutory provisions and concluded:\n\n                       “Contrary to [the plaintiff’s] arguments, the [Prisoner Review Board\n\n               (Board)] has the statutory authority to impose electronic home confinement as a\n\n               condition of his mandatory supervised release. [The plaintiff] has no right, let\n\n               alone a clear right, to demand that the Board release him from [electronic home\n\n               confinement] during his [mandatory supervised release] because the imposition of\n\n               that condition was a proper exercise of the Board’s statutory discretion. Without a\n\n               clear showing of his affirmative right to relief, [the plaintiff] has failed to\n\n               establish his right to mandamus relief, and his complaint must fail.” Holly, 231 Ill.\n\n               2d at 164-65.\n\nThat quoted paragraph—and indeed the five or so pages of statutory construction in Holly—\n\nwould have been pointless if, as we said in Ashley, the only right a prisoner could vindicate in an\n\naction for mandamus was a constitutional right. The supreme court has long held that by an\n\naction for mandamus, a prisoner may compel the performance of a purely statutory duty. See\n\nPeople ex rel. Abner v. Kinney, 30 Ill. 2d 201, 207 (1964).\n\n¶ 100          This is not to throw the door open to petty litigation. In an action for mandamus,\n\nnot only must the legal duty of the public official be clear and nondiscretionary (People ex rel.\n\nBirkett v. Konetski, 233 Ill. 2d 185, 192-93 (2009)), but the plaintiff must have a strong equitable\n\ncase (Thomas v. Village of Westchester, 132 Ill. App. 3d 190, 196 (1985)). Recreational\n\nlitigation, even if technically meritorious, should not win a writ of mandamus, which is an\n\n“extraordinary remedy.” Id. “The writ of mandamus is not a writ of right,” and even if the\n\nplaintiff has shown a clear ministerial duty on the part of the public officer, a court nevertheless\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\fmay, in its discretion, refuse to issue the writ if the court is unconvinced the writ would\n\naccomplish “substantial justice” outweighing the disruption the writ might cause. People ex rel.\n\nStettauer v. Olsen, 215 Ill. 620, 622 (1905); see also Thomas, 132 Ill. App. 3d at 196. Similarly,\n\nit must appear that the petitioner for a writ of certiorari has suffered a “substantial injury or\n\ninjustice.” Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d at 428.\n\n\n\n¶ 101                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 102           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court’s judgment in part and reverse\n\nit in part, and we remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n¶ 103           Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 29 -\n\f",

Taylor, Leif M.\n\nMcCarthy, and Eldon L. Cooper, for failing to follow mandatory legal procedures before\n\nimposing discipline upon him for violating prison rules. He sought a writ of mandamus,\n\ndeclaratory relief, and a common-law writ of certiorari. The trial court granted a motion by\n\ndefendants to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. See 735 ILCS 5/2-615\n\n(West 2016). Plaintiff appeals.\n\n¶2             In our de novo review, we agree with the trial court that the count for declaratory\n\njudgment, count II, is legally insufficient in its entirety. We disagree, however, that the\n\fremaining two counts are legally insufficient in their entirety. Therefore, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in part and reverse it in part, and we remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n¶3                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4             In his complaint, which he filed on September 14, 2015, plaintiff alleged\n\nsubstantially as follows.\n\n\n\n¶5                                        A. The Parties\n\n¶6             Plaintiff is an inmate at Lawrence Correctional Center, in Sumner, Illinois.\n\n¶7             Gladyse C. Taylor is the Department’s director.\n\n¶8             Leif M. McCarthy is the chairperson of the adjustment committee at Lawrence\n\nCorrectional Center, the committee that hears and decides inmate disciplinary reports.\n\n¶9             Eldon L. Cooper is a member of the adjustment committee.\n\n\n\n¶ 10                   B. The Inmate Disciplinary Report Issued to Plaintiff\n\n¶ 11           On December 16, 2014, an inmate disciplinary report was served on plaintiff. In\n\nthe report, a correctional officer named “J. Harper” accused plaintiff of two offenses as defined\n\nby the Department’s regulations: security group threat or unauthorized organizational activity\n\n(20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.Appendix A (2003) (No. 205)) and intimidation or threats (id. (No.\n\n206)). The report summarized the following evidence: (1) an “accumulation of incidents”\n\nconcerning plaintiff’s “involvement with the Latin Kings Security Threat Group,” including\n\nstatements of confidential informants, one of whom identified plaintiff as chairman of the Latin\n\nKing National Regional Crown Council; (2) handwritten notes, confiscated in a shakedown, in\n\nwhich he discussed Latin King business and, in one note, expressed a desire to “kick *** down\n\n                                               -2-\n\fthe steps” someone named Kevin, who had “told Springfield a lot” about the gang; and (3)\n\nrecorded telephone conversations, in which plaintiff discussed various Latin King members who\n\nwere in prison.\n\n\n\n¶ 12                                     C. Witness Request\n\n¶ 13              On December 16, 2014, plaintiff submitted to the adjustment committee a\n\ndocument, handwritten by him, in which he requested the committee to review the “[p]hone log\n\nrecords” for May 5, September 29, and October 12, 2014. He stated that those phone records\n\nwould disprove the allegation, in the disciplinary report, that he made outgoing telephone calls\n\non those days. He also “request[ed] to be shown these alleged notes” by him, confiscated in the\n\nshakedown. Finally, he made an “inmate witness request,” listing the imprisoned Latin Kings\n\nwhom he allegedly had discussed on the telephone. He wrote: “Each inmate will testify that\n\n[plaintiff] did not order or direct any security threat group activity within [the Department] ever.”\n\n\n\n¶ 14                      D. Plaintiff’s Written Statement to the Committee\n\n¶ 15              On December 19, 2014, in the hearing on the inmate disciplinary report, plaintiff\n\npresented a handwritten statement to the committee. In this statement, he began by pleading not\n\nguilty to the two charges. Then he made essentially four points.\n\n¶ 16              First, he denied the allegation, in the disciplinary report, that he made “outside\n\ntelephone calls” on May 5, August 30, and September 29, 2014. He wrote that if only the\n\ncommittee would review the “B-Wing telephone log records,” those records would show he did\n\nnot use the telephone on those dates.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f¶ 17           Second, he insisted that if there were any recordings of his telephone calls, those\n\nrecordings, when played in their entirety, would debunk the claim that he had engaged in\n\nunauthorized organizational activity.\n\n¶ 18           Third, he denied writing the notes cited in the disciplinary report. He also denied\n\nthe notes had come from his cell, property, or person, or that there were any shakedown records\n\nindicating as much. He pointed out that Harper was not a handwriting expert.\n\n¶ 19           Fourth, he claimed the disciplinary report was untimely under the Department’s\n\nregulations because it “was written beyond the [eight] days allowed after the commission of the\n\noffense or discovery thereof.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003). He noted that the report listed\n\nthe dates of “February of 2014[;] May 5, 2014[;] July 15, 2014[;] August 30, 2014[;] September\n\nof 2014[;] October 13, 2014[;] and December 7, 2014”—all of which preceded the issuance of\n\nthe report, on December 16, 2014, by more than eight days.\n\n¶ 20           His written statement concluded with the following paragraph: “I request to see\n\nthe alleged confiscated ‘notes’ regarding the [December 16, 2014,] disciplinary report, and\n\nrequest that my December 16, 2014[,] witness and document request be reviewed and considered\n\nas exculpatory evidence by the Committee.”\n\n\n\n¶ 21                               E. The Disciplinary Hearing\n\n¶ 22           Plaintiff alleges that, in the disciplinary hearing, which was held on December 19,\n\n2014, the two members of the adjustment committee, McCarthy and Cooper, declined to show\n\nhim the notes in question and declined to personally review the notes, the telephone logs, or the\n\ntelephone recordings. As for plaintiff’s witness request, “Cooper stated that Jerry Harper (the\n\nprison official who wrote the [disciplinary report] against plaintiff) [had] directed the Committee\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fnot to call any of plaintiff’s witnesses[;] thus, no witnesses would be called.” Also, Cooper told\n\nplaintiff, in the disciplinary hearing, “that the Committee [had been] directed by higher[-]up\n\nprison authorities to find plaintiff guilty and revoke a year [of] good conduct credits and impose\n\npunitive segregation and other punitive sanctions for a year.” Upon receiving that news, plaintiff\n\n“made a verbal objection” to the committee’s lack of impartiality, but McCarthy and Cooper\n\n“refused to recuse themselves.” All this is according to plaintiff’s complaint.\n\n\n\n¶ 23                              F. The Final Summary Report\n\n¶ 24            On January 3, 2015, the Department served upon plaintiff a “Final Summary\n\nReport,” in which McCarthy and Cooper found plaintiff guilty of “Gang or Unauthorized\n\nOrganization Activity” and “Intimidation or Threats.” They recommended one year in “C grade,”\n\none year of segregation, revocation of one year of good-conduct credits, restriction for one year\n\nto $15 per month, and one year of “Contact Visits Restriction.” The chief administrative officer,\n\nStephen B. Duncan, approved the recommendation.\n\n\n\n¶ 25                                 G. Plaintiff’s Grievance\n\n¶ 26            On January 5, 2015, plaintiff administratively appealed the discipline by filing a\n\ngrievance. He complained of the committee members’ refusal to produce and personally review\n\nthe notes, telephone logs, and telephone recordings; their refusal to recuse themselves; the\n\nuntimeliness of the disciplinary report; and other irregularities, which we will discuss in greater\n\ndetail later in this opinion.\n\n¶ 27            On August 13, 2015, by adding her signature to a form, Taylor concurred with the\n\ndenial of plaintiff’s grievance. The Department “[found] no violation of the offender’s due\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fprocess in accordance with [sections 504.30 and 504.80 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30, 504.80\n\n(2003))],” to quote the check-marked preprinted language of the form. The Department was\n\n“reasonably satisfied the offender committed the offense cited in the report.”\n\n\n\n¶ 28                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 29                          A. The Request for Mandamus (Count I)\n\n¶ 30             Because the motion for dismissal was pursuant to section 2-615 of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-615 (West 2016)), the question is whether the complaint states a\n\ncause of action for mandamus, declaratory relief, or a common-law writ of certiorari: the three\n\nforms of relief that plaintiff sought in the three counts of his complaint. See Johannesen v.\n\nEddins, 2011 IL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27.\n\n¶ 31             We answer that question de novo, taking the well-pleaded facts or specific factual\n\nallegations of the complaint to be true and disregarding any conclusory allegations unsupported\n\nby well-pleaded facts. Simpkins v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 2012 IL 110662, ¶ 26; Primax\n\nRecoveries, Inc. v. Atherton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1010 (2006). Not only will we assume the\n\nwell-pleaded facts in the complaint to be true, but we will regard those facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to plaintiff. See Johannesen, 2011 IL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27. If, from the well-pleaded\n\nfacts, a reasonable inference could be drawn in plaintiff’s favor—which is to say, in favor of the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the complaint—we will draw that inference. See id. “Dismissal pursuant to\n\nsection 2-615 *** is only proper where, when construing the allegations of the complaint in the\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiff, it clearly appears that no set of facts can be proved under the\n\npleadings which will entitle the plaintiff to recover.” Armstrong v. Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n568-69 (2003).\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f¶ 32           With those ground rules in mind, we first evaluate the legal sufficiency of count I,\n\nthe count seeking mandamus. By its factual allegations, count I must establish three propositions.\n\nFirst, under the law, plaintiff has a clear right to the performance of the ministerial act that he\n\nseeks to compel the public officer to perform. See Burris v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146151/burris-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (2009);\n\nBaldacchino v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1997). Second, plaintiff demanded that the\n\npublic officer perform the act (unless such a demand would have been futile), and the public\n\nofficer refused to do so. See Eley v. Cahill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276-77 (1970). Third, the public\n\nofficer has clear authority to comply with the proposed writ of mandamus. See Burris, 232 Ill. 2d\n\nat 7.\n\n¶ 33           Plaintiff argues that defendants have both authority and a duty to comply with the\n\nDepartment’s regulations. We do not understand defendants as disputing that argument.\n\n“Administrative regulations have the force and effect of law” (People v. Bonutti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094065\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094065/people-v-bonutti/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n188 (2004)), and a prisoner may file a complaint for mandamus to compel correctional officers to\n\nperform nondiscretionary duties laid down in the Department’s regulations (West v. Gramley,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557 (1994); Shea v. Edwards, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765 (1981))—assuming the prisoner has a substantial personal\n\ninterest in the matter (see Warden v. Byrne, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (1981); North v. Board of\n\nTrustees of the University of Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (1891)).\n\n¶ 34           Citing several paragraphs of his complaint, plaintiff argues he specifically alleged\n\nviolations of the Department’s regulations and that mandamus should compel compliance with\n\nthese regulations. We will discuss the alleged violations one by one.\n\n\n\n¶ 35           1. Review of the Inmate Disciplinary Report by a Hearing Investigator\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f¶ 36           Under section 504.60(a), “[t]he Chief Administrative Officer shall appoint one or\n\nmore Hearing Investigators[,] who shall review all major disciplinary reports.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.60(a) (2003). Plaintiff claims the Department violated this\n\nsection. In support of his claim, he references the inmate disciplinary report, a copy of which is\n\nattached to his complaint as exhibit A: in the report, the box next to “Hearing Investigator’s\n\nReview Required” is blank, as is the line for the hearing officer’s signature.\n\n¶ 37           Evidently, judging by exhibit A, the Department decided a hearing investigator’s\n\nreview was not required in this case. Necessarily, that decision entailed the exercise of judgment,\n\nbecause a hearing investigator’s review was required only for “major” disciplinary reports, and it\n\nwas a matter of judgment whether a disciplinary report was “major.” Id.\n\n¶ 38           No doubt, plaintiff would regard that decision as a misjudgment or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, but the conscientiousness of the exercise of judgment or discretion is beside the point.\n\nThe question is not whether the exercise of judgment or discretion was sound; the question is\n\nwhether the exercise of judgment or discretion was required. Mandamus “will not be granted\n\nwhen the act in question involves the exercise of discretion.” (Emphasis in original.) The Y-Not\n\nProject, Ltd. v. Fox Waterway Agency, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35. The act that the plaintiff\n\nseeks to compel in a mandamus action must be purely ministerial in nature, involving no use of\n\njudgment. Id. This act involved the use of judgment. Thus, with respect to the omission of a\n\nhearing investigator’s review, plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 39                       2. Failure To Serve the Disciplinary Report\n                           Upon Plaintiff by the Regulatory Deadline\n\n¶ 40           Section 504.30(f) provides as follows: “Service of a disciplinary report upon the\n\noffender shall commence the disciplinary proceeding. In no event shall a disciplinary report ***\n\n                                                -8-\n\fbe served upon an adult offender more than [eight] days *** after the commission of an offense\n\nor the discovery thereof unless the offender is unavailable or unable to participate in the\n\nproceeding.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003).\n\n¶ 41           Plaintiff alleges the disciplinary report was issued on December 16, 2014, and that\n\nthe disciplinary report “lists incident dates of February of 2014; May 5, 2014; July 15, 2014;\n\nAugust 30, 2014; September of 2014; October 13, 2014[;] [and] December 7, 2014”—all of\n\nwhich predate the issuance of the disciplinary report by more than eight days. Obviously, the\n\ndisciplinary report could not have been served upon him before it was issued. He argues that,\n\nbecause of the Department’s failure to meet the eight-day deadline for serving the disciplinary\n\nreport on him, the Department has a clear duty, under section 504.30(f), to withdraw the\n\ndisciplinary report and the associated penalties. See id.\n\n¶ 42           Even this eight-day deadline, however, requires the exercise of judgment or\n\ndiscretion: “In no event shall a disciplinary report *** be served upon an adult offender more\n\nthan [eight] days *** after the commission of an offense or the discovery thereof unless the\n\noffender is unavailable or unable to participate in the proceeding.” (Emphasis added.) Id. It\n\nrequires judgment to determine whether and when an offense was committed. An evaluation\n\nmust be performed. The Department must compare the known facts with the elements of the\n\noffense and must reach a conclusion. For that matter, it requires judgment to determine whether\n\nthe offender is able to participate in the proceeding. No doubt plaintiff would argue that\n\njudgment, under these circumstances, could have been soundly exercised in only one way. Even\n\nso, judgment had to be exercised. It follows that the Department’s duty under section 504.30(f) is\n\nnot purely ministerial and that, with respect to the alleged noncompliance with the eight-day\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fdeadline in that section, plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus. See Fox Waterway,\n\n2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n\n\n¶ 43                      3. Failure To Provide a Written Reason for Denying\n                      Plaintiff’s Request for the In-Person Testimony of Witnesses\n\n¶ 44               Plaintiff claims the Department violated section 504.80(h)(4) of its regulations\n\n(20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(h)(4) (2003)) by failing to provide a written reason for denying his\n\nrequest for the in-person testimony of witnesses at his disciplinary hearing.\n\n¶ 45               Defendants respond that plaintiff failed to fulfill a procedural precondition. They\n\nobserve that, under section 504.80(f)(2) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2) (2003)), “[t]he [witness]\n\nrequest [had to] be in writing on the space provided in the disciplinary report” and that the\n\nrequest had to “include an explanation of what the witnesses would state.” Instead of using the\n\ndesignated space in the disciplinary report to request witnesses, plaintiff used a separate sheet of\n\npaper, and he did not explain what the witnesses would state. On the authority of Taylor v. Frey,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (2011), defendants argue the Department was within its discretion to\n\nrefuse to hear witnesses, given that plaintiff never requested them in the manner that subsection\n\n(f)(2) required.\n\n¶ 46               To clarify, under the Department’s regulation, there are two kinds of requests for\n\nwitnesses: a request for the prehearing interview of witnesses (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2)\n\n(2003)) and a request for the in-person testimony of witnesses in the disciplinary hearing (20 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code 504.80(h)(3) (2003)). It is unclear which kind of witness request plaintiff intended to\n\nmake. Was he requesting a prehearing interview of the witnesses pursuant to subsection (f)(2), or\n\nwas he requesting the in-person testimony of the witnesses pursuant to subsection (h)(3)? In his\n\nrequest, a copy of which is attached to the complaint as exhibit B, he confusingly cited both\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\fsubsection (f)(2) and subsection (h)(3). If he meant to request the prehearing interview of\n\nwitnesses pursuant to subsection (f)(2), he would have had to do so in the space provided in the\n\ndisciplinary report (see 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(2) (2003) (“The request shall be in writing\n\non the space provided in the disciplinary report and shall include an explanation of what the\n\nwitnesses would state.”)). He did not do so. Whether that omission was problematic depended on\n\nwhich kind of witness request he was making—and, in that respect, his witness request was\n\nunclear. His request did not specifically say what he wanted the Department to do: interview the\n\nwitnesses ahead of time or arrange for their attendance in the disciplinary hearing, and as we\n\nnoted, his request cited both subsection (f)(2) and subsection (h)(3).\n\n¶ 47           Because of this ambiguity in his request, the Department had no “clear duty” to\n\nprovide a written reason for denying the request. Orenic v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077498\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077498/orenic-v-ill-st-labor-rel-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467-68 (1989). That duty under section 504.80(h)(4) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(h)(4) (2003)) would have kicked in only if plaintiff requested the in-person attendance of\n\nwitnesses. It is unclear if he did so. Therefore, the Department had no clear duty, under section\n\n504.80(h)(4), to provide a written reason for the denial. It follows that, with respect to the\n\nDepartment’s alleged failure to provide a written reason for denying the in-person attendance of\n\nwitnesses (see id.), plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 48                    4. Failure To Place Plaintiff Under Investigation\n\n¶ 49           Plaintiff claims the Department violated section 504.30(e) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.30(e) (2003)) in that the Department “never placed [him] under investigation.” That section\n\nprovides: “If an offender is suspected of committing a disciplinary offense, an investigative\n\ndisciplinary report, hereinafter referred to as an investigative report, may be issued that\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\freasonably informs the offender of the subject of the investigation to the extent that safety and\n\nsecurity allow.” (Emphasis added.) Id. Because the word “may” calls for an exercise of\n\ndiscretion (Krautsack v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047989\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047989/krautsack-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (2006)), and because mandamus may\n\ncompel the performance of only a nondiscretionary, ministerial duty (Fox Waterway, 2016 IL\n\nApp (2d) 150502, ¶ 35), we conclude that, with respect to the alleged violation of section\n\n504.30(e), plaintiff states no cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 50                     5. The Committee’s Failure To Independently Review\n                           the Notes and the Telephone Logs and Recordings\n\n¶ 51           Plaintiff claims the committee members violated section 504.80(g) (20 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 504.80(g) (2003)) by failing to independently review the notes and the telephone logs and\n\nrecordings, as opposed to relying merely on summaries and quotations provided by other\n\ncorrectional officers.\n\n¶ 52           Section 504.80(g) consists of a single sentence, which reads as follows: “The\n\nCommittee shall consider all material presented that is relevant to the issue of whether or not the\n\noffender committed the offense.” Id. It requires an exercise of judgment to determine which\n\nmaterials are relevant—even if relevance should be obvious. Therefore, with respect to the\n\nalleged violation of section 504.80(g), plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus. See\n\nFox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n¶ 53           In so holding, we acknowledge the federal cases that plaintiff cites. Those cases\n\nfound a due-process violation (or at least an arguable due-process violation) in the refusal of a\n\nprison disciplinary tribunal to produce incriminating documents allegedly written by the prisoner\n\n(Young v.

Mass. 1986)) or in the refusal to review primary evidentiary materials as opposed to\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\fsecondhand summaries of those materials (McIntosh v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (W.D. Ky.\n\n1983)). For two reasons, however, we find those federal cases to be inapposite. First, decisions of\n\nthe United States District Court and the Court of Appeals do not establish Illinois law (see\n\nPeople v. Pitzman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (1997)), and, thus, they do not establish a “clear\n\nduty” on the part of defendants (Burris, 232 Ill. 2d at 7). Second, none of those federal cases\n\nsought mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 54                    6. The Committee’s Refusal To Produce the Notes\n\n¶ 55           Plaintiff alleges that, both before and during the disciplinary hearing, he requested\n\nto see the notes he allegedly had written and that the Department denied those requests, thereby\n\nviolating section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)).\n\n¶ 56           Under section 504.80(f)(1), “[t]he offender may *** produce any relevant\n\ndocuments in his or her defense.” Id. Thus, instead of having the right to present any and all\n\ndocuments in his or her defense, the offender has a right to present only “relevant” documents in\n\nhis or her defense. Id. To decide whether a document is presentable in the disciplinary hearing,\n\nthe Department has to decide whether it is relevant. Because the determination of relevancy\n\nrequires an exercise of judgment, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus with\n\nrespect to the alleged violation of section 504.80(f)(1). See Fox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d)\n\n150502, ¶ 35. Again, it does not matter if judgment could have been reasonably exercised in only\n\none way; judgment is judgment.\n\n\n\n¶ 57               7. The Committee Members’ Refusal To Recuse Themselves\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f¶ 58           Plaintiff argues the committee members should have recused themselves because,\n\nhaving been directed by higher-up prison authorities to find him guilty and to impose particular\n\npenalties, they lacked impartiality.\n\n¶ 59           The asserted duty of recusal, however, would not have been a ministerial duty.\n\nRather, the committee members would have had to perform a legal evaluation: they would have\n\nhad to judge whether, in the light of relevant case law, the alleged directive from above\n\ndisqualified them from being impartial hearing officers. Therefore, with respect to their refusal to\n\nrecuse themselves, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for mandamus. See Fox Waterway,\n\n2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35.\n\n\n\n¶ 60           8. Failure To Follow a Required Procedure After a Prisoner Objects to\n                Committee Members on the Ground of Their Lack of Impartiality\n\n¶ 61           In his complaint, plaintiff makes the following factual allegations, which, again,\n\nfor purposes of section 2-615, we assume to be true. See Schweihs, 2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27. In the\n\ndisciplinary hearing, one of the defendants, Eldon L. Cooper, who was a member of the\n\nadjustment committee, told plaintiff “that the Committee [had been] directed by higher[-]up\n\nprison authorities to find plaintiff guilty and revoke a year[’s] good conduct credit and impose\n\npunitive segregation and other punitive sanctions for a year.” Plaintiff immediately made a\n\nverbal objection to the committee members’ lack of impartiality, but they refused to recuse\n\nthemselves. Afterward, in its final summary report, the committee made no mention of plaintiff’s\n\nobjection to the committee members’ lack of impartiality.\n\n¶ 62           Plaintiff argues this omission violated section 504.80(d) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(d) (2003)), which provides as follows: “Any person *** who is *** not impartial shall\n\nnot serve on the Adjustment Committee hearing that disciplinary report. An offender who objects\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fto a member of the Committee based on a lack of impartiality must raise the matter at the\n\nbeginning of the hearing. The Committee shall document the basis of the objection and the\n\ndecision in the Adjustment Committee summary.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 63           Plaintiff alleged he made a timely objection to the committee members’ lack of\n\nimpartiality, and the committee had a clear, nondiscretionary duty, under section 504.80(d), to\n\n“document the basis of the objection and the decision in the Adjustment Committee summary.”\n\nId. In the grievance that plaintiff filed on January 5, 2015, one of his complaints was that the\n\ncommittee had “arbitrarily failed to document [his] objections concerning the Committee[’s] not\n\nbeing impartial, in violation of [section] 504.80(d).” The Department denied his grievance.\n\nTherefore, in this context, all the elements of mandamus are present: “a clear right to relief, a\n\nclear duty of the public official to act, and a clear authority in the public official to comply with\n\nthe [proposed] writ.” Burris, 232 Ill. 2d at 7. With respect to the Department’s noncompliance\n\nwith section 504.80(d), plaintiff states a cause of action for mandamus.\n\n\n\n¶ 64            9. Failure To Include a Summary of Plaintiff’s Written Statement\n\n¶ 65           Section 504.80(l)(1) provides as follows:\n\n                       “l) A written record shall be prepared and signed by all members of the\n\n               Committee that contains:\n\n                               1) A summary of oral and written statements and other evidence\n\n                       presented.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(l)(1) (2003).\n\nSubsection (o) provides: “A copy of the disciplinary report and Adjustment Committee summary\n\nshall be forwarded to the Chief Administrative Officer for review and approval and a copy shall\n\nbe filed in the offender’s record.” 20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(o) (2003). Apparently, the summary\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fof the offender’s written statement is part of what the “Chief Administrative Officer” would\n\nreview in deciding whether to approve the “Adjustment Committee dispositions.” 20 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 504.80(p) (2003).\n\n¶ 66           Plaintiff alleges that although, in the disciplinary hearing, he submitted to the\n\nadjustment committee a written statement (exhibit C of the complaint), the committee’s final\n\nsummary report (exhibit D) lacks a summary of his written statement. Plaintiff subsequently\n\ncomplained, in his grievance (exhibit E), that the committee had “failed to give a summary of\n\n[his] written statement, in violation of [section] 504.80(l)(1),” but the Department denied his\n\ngrievance.\n\n¶ 67           Because the committee members had a clear ministerial duty to include, in the\n\nadministrative record, signed by them, a summary of plaintiff’s written statement (see 20 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code 504.80(l)(1) (2003)), plaintiff states a cause of action for mandamus in this respect.\n\nSee Fox Waterway, 2016 IL App (2d) 150502, ¶ 35; Thompson v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n863 (1990) (this regulatory requirement of summarizing all the evidence, including the oral and\n\nwritten statements, “is not to be taken lightly”).\n\n\n\n¶ 68                  B. The Request for a Declaratory Judgment (Count II)\n\n¶ 69           We have held that an action for a common-law writ of certiorari, instead of an\n\naction for a declaratory judgment, is the correct means by which to seek the review of penalties\n\nimposed in a prison disciplinary proceeding. Alicea v. Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (2001).\n\nTherefore, plaintiff fails to state a cause of action for a declaratory judgment. See id.\n\n\n\n¶ 70            C. The Request for a Common-Law Writ of Certiorari (Count III)\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f¶ 71               1. The Availability of a Common-Law Action for Certiorari\n\n¶ 72           If an administrative agency issues a quasi-judicial decision (McKeown v. Moore,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (1922)) and the statute conferring power on the agency does not adopt the\n\nAdministrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. (West 2014)) or provide any other\n\nmethod of judicial review, the decision is reviewable in an action for a common-law writ of\n\ncertiorari (Hanrahan v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2148929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2148929/hanrahan-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1996)). Because the statutory provisions\n\npertaining to prison disciplinary procedures (730 ILCS 5/3-8-7 to 3-8-10 (West 2014)) neither\n\nadopt the Administrative Review Law nor provide any other method of judicial review, prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings are reviewable in an action for certiorari. Alicea, 321 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n253.\n\n\n\n¶ 73                 2. The Nature of a Common-Law Action for Certiorari\n\n¶ 74           Whereas mandamus compels a governmental official to perform a ministerial act,\n\na common-law writ of certiorari “bring[s] before the court issuing it the record of the inferior\n\ntribunal for review.” Barden v. Junior College District No. 520, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

The circuit court will\n\nissue a writ of certiorari to the agency, and within the time specified in the writ (see Murphy v.\n\nCuesta, Rey & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3416085\"><a href=\"/opinion/3419637/murphy-v-cuesta-rey-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (1942)), the agency must provide the court with the record\n\nof the administrative proceedings so that the court can determine from the record—and only\n\nfrom the record (Reichert v. Court of Claims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2029779\"><a href=\"/opinion/2029779/reichert-v-court-of-claims-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 (2003); Goodfriend v.

Coffin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 (1921);\n\nGoodfriend, 18 Ill.

The burden will be on the agency to provide a record\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 -\n\fadequate to that purpose: a record consisting of facts, not mere conclusions (Funkhouser, 301 Ill.\n\nat 261).

If, from the record, it appears that the inferior tribunal lacked\n\njurisdiction or that its actions were inconsistent with the law, the court may quash the\n\nproceedings of the inferior tribunal. Goodfriend, 18 Ill. App. 3d at 419. Alternatively, if, from the\n\nrecord, it appears that the inferior tribunal had jurisdiction and that its actions were consistent\n\nwith the law, the court should dismiss the certiorari count and quash the writ. Id.\n\n\n\n¶ 76                               3. The Pleading Requirements\n\n¶ 77           A petition for a common-law writ of certiorari must allege “good cause” for the\n\nissuance of a writ (City of Chicago v. Condell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597 (1906)): the petition must allege\n\nthat the inferior tribunal or the agency exercising a quasi-judicial function (Reichert, 203 Ill. 2d\n\nat 260) failed to comply with the law or exceeded its authority (City of Kankakee v. Department\n\nof Revenue, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14), with the result that the petitioner suffered\n\n“substantial injury or injustice” (Stratton v. Wenona Community Unit District No. 1, 133 Ill. 2d\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f413, 428 (1990)). If the plaintiff (1) was a party to the administrative proceeding (Board of\n\nEducation of Woodland Community Consolidated School District 50 v. Illinois State Charter\n\nSchool Comm’n, 2016 IL App (1st) 151372, ¶ 39); (2) was substantially injured by the agency’s\n\nfailure to follow an essential procedural requirement applicable to such a proceeding (id.; C&K\n\nDistributors, Inc. v. Hynes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Refusal To Produce the Notes in Question\n\n¶ 80            First, plaintiff alleges that, both before and during the disciplinary hearing, he\n\nrequested to see the notes he allegedly had written. In exhibit B of the complaint, addressed to\n\nthe adjustment committee and dated December 16, 2014, plaintiff stated: “I request to be shown\n\nthe alleged ‘notes.’ ” In exhibit C of the complaint, likewise addressed to the adjustment\n\ncommittee and dated December 19, 2014, he cited section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(f)(1) (2003)) and stated: “I request to see the alleged confiscated ‘notes’ regarding the\n\n12-16-14 disciplinary report, and request that my December 16, 2014[,] witness and document\n\nrequest be reviewed and considered as exculpatory evidence by the Committee.” Without\n\nexplanation, the committee refused to produce the notes in the disciplinary hearing, or so\n\n\n\n                                                  - 19 -\n\fplaintiff alleges in his complaint. Afterward, in his grievance, plaintiff complained: “The\n\nCommittee arbitrarily failed to review or allow me to review the alleged ‘notes’ stated in the 12-\n\n16-14 [inmate disciplinary report].” The Department denied the grievance, “find[ing] no\n\nviolation of the offender’s due process in accordance with [sections 504.80 (20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80 (2003)) and 504.30 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30 (2003))].”\n\n¶ 81           Under section 504.80(f)(1) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)), “[t]he\n\noffender may *** produce any relevant documents in his or her defense.” Thus, the Department\n\nhad a duty to allow plaintiff to produce any relevant documents in his defense. Given that the\n\ndisciplinary report cited the notes as evidence against plaintiff, it would be untenable to\n\ncharacterize the notes as irrelevant. The Department was required to follow its own regulations\n\n(see Thompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 860), and it was the Department’s duty, under section\n\n504.80(f)(1), to allow plaintiff to “produce” the notes in his own defense. 20 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n504.80(f)(1) (2003). One of the meanings of “produce” is to “show *** (something) for\n\nconsideration” or “inspection.” The New Oxford American Dictionary 1359 (2001). If, in his\n\nown defense, plaintiff wanted to show the notes in question, to prove he was not their author, and\n\nif the Department had exclusive possession of the notes and refused to relinquish them for his\n\nuse in the disciplinary hearing, the Department violated its regulatory duty to allow plaintiff to\n\n“produce any relevant documents in his *** defense” (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.80(f)(1) (2003)).\n\nSee also Thompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 859 (one of the due-process rights of a prisoner in a\n\nprison disciplinary proceeding is to “present documentary evidence in his defense”). The alleged\n\nviolation of section 504.80(f)(1) is significant and in itself would justify the issuance of a\n\ncommon-law writ of certiorari. See Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d at 428; Condell, 224 Ill. at 597; City of\n\nKankakee, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14; Tanner v. Court of Claims, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

The Refusal of the Committee Members To Recuse Themselves\n\n¶ 84           Second, plaintiff alleges the committee members should have recused themselves\n\nbecause, having been directed by higher-up prison authorities to find him guilty and to impose\n\nparticular penalties, they lacked impartiality. In a disciplinary hearing, the prisoner has a due-\n\nprocess right to, among other things, an impartial hearing officer. Epstein v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 63, 64 (1989).\n\n¶ 85           We begin with the presumption that the members of the adjustment committee\n\nwere “objective and capable of fairly judging the issues.” Hurst v. Department of Employment\n\nSecurity, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (2009). Like all presumptions, however, that presumption is\n\nrebuttable. “Bias or prejudice may *** be shown if a disinterested observer might conclude that\n\nthe official had in some measure adjudged the facts as well as the law of the case in advance of\n\nhearing it.” Id. Taking the well-pleaded facts of the complaint to be true and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor (see Schweihs, 2016 IL 120041, ¶ 27; Johannesen, 2011\n\nIL App (2d) 110108, ¶ 27), a disinterested observer might conclude that the members of the\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\fadjustment committee had prejudged the case before hearing it, considering it is alleged that (1)\n\nthey personally examined none of the primary evidentiary materials; (2) Cooper told plaintiff, in\n\nthe hearing, that their superiors had ordered them to find him guilty and to impose certain\n\npenalties; and (3) they then found him guilty and imposed precisely the penalties their superiors\n\nhad ordered them to impose. Given the factual allegations of the complaint, which our standard\n\nof review obliges us to take as true, the impartiality of the administrative tribunal is sufficiently\n\nin question that good cause exists for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. See Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d\n\nat 428; Condell, 224 Ill. at 597; City of Kankakee, 2013 IL App (3d) 120599, ¶ 14; Tanner, 256\n\nIll. App. 3d at 1092.\n\n¶ 86           This claim of bias should not take the Department by surprise. In his grievance,\n\ndefendant stated: “[Correctional Officer] Cooper *** stated that the committee was told to give\n\nme a year across the board and find me guilty. I made verbal objections to the committee not\n\nbeing impartial.” This was a serious allegation, which plaintiff formally made in a grievance, and\n\none would expect the administrative record to contain a rebuttal, considering that Taylor denied\n\nthe grievance. In response to a writ of certiorari, the Department should produce this record.\n\n\n\n¶ 87             6. The Eight-Day Deadline for Serving the Disciplinary Report\n\n¶ 88            Additionally, in his count for certiorari, plaintiff alleges the Department violated\n\nsection 504.30(f) (20 Ill. Adm. Code 504.30(f) (2003)) in that “[t]he December 16, 2014, [inmate\n\ndisciplinary report] was written beyond the statutory eight (8) days allowed after the incident.”\n\nSpecifically, he alleges the disciplinary report was written (and therefore served upon him) more\n\nthan eight days after the final evidentiary incident listed in the disciplinary report, namely, the\n\ntelephone call of December 7, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f¶ 89           That is not enough, however, to establish a violation of the regulation. Plaintiff\n\nmust plead facts that would, if proved, establish the Department’s noncompliance with the eight-\n\nday deadline in section 504.30(f) (see Teter v. Clemens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067647/teter-v-clemens/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (1986)), and merely\n\nby proving that the Department served the disciplinary report on him more than eight days after\n\nthe final telephone call, plaintiff would not prove noncompliance with the eight-day deadline.\n\n¶ 90           In concluding that plaintiff committed the offense of security group threat or\n\nunauthorized organization activity, the Department relied not only on the telephone calls, but\n\nalso on statements by confidential informants. We do not know when the Department\n\ninterviewed these confidential informants. The Department could have done so the day before\n\nserving the disciplinary report on plaintiff. Likewise, for purposes of the offense of intimidation,\n\nwe do not know when the Department came into the possession of a handwriting sample by\n\nplaintiff, to compare it with the note that Harper had confiscated in the shakedown. For all we\n\nknow, the Department made the comparison the day before serving the disciplinary report on\n\nplaintiff. Therefore, with respect to the alleged failure to meet the eight-day deadline in section\n\n504.30(f), plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action for a common-law writ of certiorari.\n\n\n\n¶ 91                     D. The Rationale for the Motion for Dismissal:\n                      the Suggestion That the Illinois Administrative Code\n                                Confers No Rights on Prisoners\n\n¶ 92           In support of its motion for dismissal, the State cited Ashley v. Snyder, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 1252, 1258 (2000), and two cases that relied on Ashley: Duane v. Hardy, 2012 IL App\n\n(3d) 110845, ¶ 15, and Dupree v. Hardy, 2011 IL App (4th) 100351, ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 93           In Ashley, a correctional center in which the plaintiff was imprisoned issued a\n\npolicy-revising bulletin, which lessened the amount of personal property that inmates were\n\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\fpermitted to keep in their cells. Previously, an orientation manual permitted inmates to keep\n\nmore personal property. Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1254. The plaintiff contended that the bulletin\n\nviolated various provisions of the United States and Illinois Constitutions, as well as several state\n\nand federal statutes. Id. at 1253.\n\n¶ 94           One of the plaintiff’s constitutional contentions was that the bulletin deprived him\n\nof property without the due process of law. Id. at 1255. We rejected that contention because, in\n\nSandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477-84 (1995), the Supreme Court had held that, for purposes\n\nof the due-process clause (U.S. Const., amend. XIV), states could not “create enforceable liberty\n\ninterests in freedom from the routine deprivations and discomforts of prison life.” Ashley, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1255. Although, for the benefit of prisoners, states could “ ‘create liberty interests ***\n\nprotected by the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause,’ ” those interests would “ ‘generally [be] limited to\n\nfreedom from restraint which *** imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 1255-56 (quoting\n\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484). Restricting the amount of personal property inmates could keep in their\n\ncells did not qualify as an atypical and significant hardship, and, thus, for purposes of due\n\nprocess, such a restriction did “not impact a protected liberty interest.” Id. at 1256.\n\n¶ 95           We likewise rejected the plaintiff’s other constitutional theories. The bulletin did\n\nnot change the definition of his crime or create any risk of increasing the punishment for his\n\ncrime, and hence the ex post facto clause (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 16) was irrelevant. Ashley,\n\n316 Ill. App. 3d at 1257. The bulletin was not an unreasonable seizure under the fourth\n\namendment (U.S. Const., amend. IV), because the fourth amendment was inapplicable in prison\n\ncells. Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1257. Nor did the bulletin violate the eighth amendment (U.S.\n\nConst., amend. VIII); limiting the amount of property that inmates could keep in their cells was\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\fpart of the penalty that criminal offenders typically had to pay for their offenses. Ashley, 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1257.\n\n¶ 96           We also were unconvinced that statutory law lent any support to the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim. Rather, section 3-4-3 of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/3-4-3 (West 1998))\n\nexplicitly contemplated that inmates would “ ‘not [be] allowed’ ” to keep some “ ‘personal\n\nproperty.’ ” Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258 (quoting 730 ILCS 5/3-4-3 (West 1998)).\n\n¶ 97           Those holdings rightly disposed of all the constitutional and statutory claims that\n\nthe plaintiff had raised in Ashley. Nevertheless, in an “epilogue,” we added:\n\n                       “In so holding, we note that this sort of ‘prisoner’s rights’ case depletes\n\n               the resources of prosecutors, the judiciary, and [the Department], and\n\n               unnecessarily diverts [the Department’s] attention from ensuring that prisoners\n\n               are granted their genuine rights. Prison regulations, such as those contained in the\n\n               inmate orientation manual relied on here, were never intended to confer rights on\n\n               inmates or serve as a basis for constitutional claims. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482***.\n\n               Instead, Illinois [Department] regulations, as well as the Unified Code, were\n\n               designed to provide guidance to prison officials in the administration of prisons.\n\n               In addition, Illinois law creates no more rights for inmates than those which are\n\n               constitutionally required.\n\n                       ***\n\n                       *** Inmates thus have a constitutional right to adequate shelter, food,\n\n               drinking water, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety. [Citations.]\n\n               Prisoners also have a reasonable right of access to courts and a right to a\n\n               reasonable opportunity to exercise religious freedom under the first amendment.\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f               [Citation.] Beyond these, prisoners possess no other rights, only privileges.”\n\n               (Emphases in original.) Id. at 1258-59.\n\n¶ 98           It is true that “[p]rison regulations” of the type represented by the inmate\n\norientation manual confer no rights on inmates (id. at 1258), but that is because bulletins,\n\nhandbooks, and similar materials are not the Illinois Administrative Code (see Lucas v.\n\nDepartment of Corrections, 2012 IL App (4th) 110004, ¶ 14). A procedural operating manual is\n\n“designed to provide guidance” (Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258), but the Illinois Administrative\n\nCode is different: it is more than guidance; it has “the force and effect of law” (People ex rel.\n\nMadigan v. Illinois Commerce Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2216612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2216612/people-ex-rel-madigan-v-illinois-commerce-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380 (2008); People v. Montalvo, 2016\n\nIL App (2d) 140905, ¶ 18). To say that “Illinois law,” including the Illinois Administrative Code,\n\n“creates no more rights for inmates than those which are constitutionally required” would be to\n\nsay that, for inmates, Illinois law is redundant and superfluous—it might as well not exist for\n\nthem. (Emphasis in original.) Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258. Not only is that statement\n\nunsupported by citation to any authority, but it is irreconcilable with case law preceding Ashley.\n\nIt had always been the law that, in prison disciplinary proceedings, the Department had to follow\n\nits own promulgated regulations (Clayton-El v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899 (1990);\n\nThompson, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 860; People ex rel. Yoder v. Hardy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495\n\n(1983)) and that inmates could sue to compel correctional officers to perform nondiscretionary\n\nduties set forth in the Department’s regulations (West, 262 Ill. App. 3d at 557; Shea, 221 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 221; Taylor, 93 Ill. App. 3d at 765). To the extent that Ashley suggests otherwise, we\n\ndecline to follow Ashley.\n\n¶ 99           It is true that, for purposes of constitutional due process, the liberty interests that\n\nstate statutes create are “generally limited to freedom from restraint which *** imposes atypical\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\fand significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484. That does not mean, however, that it is impossible for a state statute to\n\ncreate other, nonconstitutional rights for inmates, enforceable by mandamus. Several years after\n\nthe issuance of Ashley, in an original mandamus action brought by a prisoner (see Ill. S. Ct. R.\n\n381(c) (eff. Mar. 1, 2001)), the supreme court described the elements of mandamus as follows:\n\n                       “Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy to enforce, as a matter of right, the\n\n               performance of official duties by a public officer where no exercise of discretion\n\n               on his part is involved. *** [Citation.] To obtain relief, a plaintiff must establish a\n\n               clear right to mandamus. [Citation.] Mandamus is improper where its effect is to\n\n               substitute the court’s judgment or discretion for that of the body which is\n\n               commanded to act. *** [Citation.] Consequently, we will not grant mandamus\n\n               relief unless the plaintiff has clearly shown: (1) an affirmative right to relief; (2)\n\n               defendant’s duty to act; and (3) defendant’s authority to comply with the order.\n\n               [Citation.]” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Holly v. Montes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169576\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169576/holly-v-montes/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n               159 (2008).\n\nNotably absent from this description of mandamus is any requirement that the plaintiff-prisoner’s\n\n“affirmative right to relief” be constitutional. Id. The prisoner in Holly contended that, under\n\nboth statutory law and the due-process clause (whether of the Illinois Constitution or the United\n\nStates Constitution or both is unspecified), he had a clear right to mandatory supervised release\n\nthat was free of the condition of electronic home monitoring. Id. at 156. If, as we had held in\n\nAshley, “Illinois law create[d] no more rights for inmates than those which [were]\n\nconstitutionally required” (emphasis in original) (Ashley, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 1258), the plaintiff’s\n\nstatutory argument would have been superfluous, and the supreme court could have proceeded\n\n\n\n                                               - 27 -\n\fdirectly to his alternative, constitutional theory. But the supreme court painstakingly construed\n\nthe relevant statutory provisions and concluded:\n\n                       “Contrary to [the plaintiff’s] arguments, the [Prisoner Review Board\n\n               (Board)] has the statutory authority to impose electronic home confinement as a\n\n               condition of his mandatory supervised release. [The plaintiff] has no right, let\n\n               alone a clear right, to demand that the Board release him from [electronic home\n\n               confinement] during his [mandatory supervised release] because the imposition of\n\n               that condition was a proper exercise of the Board’s statutory discretion. Without a\n\n               clear showing of his affirmative right to relief, [the plaintiff] has failed to\n\n               establish his right to mandamus relief, and his complaint must fail.” Holly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n               <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 164-65.\n\nThat quoted paragraph—and indeed the five or so pages of statutory construction in Holly—\n\nwould have been pointless if, as we said in Ashley, the only right a prisoner could vindicate in an\n\naction for mandamus was a constitutional right. The supreme court has long held that by an\n\naction for mandamus, a prisoner may compel the performance of a purely statutory duty. See\n\nPeople ex rel. Abner v. Kinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2142739\"><a href=\"/opinion/2142739/peo-ex-rel-abner-v-kinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (1964).\n\n¶ 100          This is not to throw the door open to petty litigation. In an action for mandamus,\n\nnot only must the legal duty of the public official be clear and nondiscretionary (People ex rel.\n\nBirkett v. Konetski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143121/people-ex-rel-birkett-v-konetski/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192-93 (2009)), but the plaintiff must have a strong equitable\n\ncase (Thomas v. Village of Westchester, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (1985)). Recreational\n\nlitigation, even if technically meritorious, should not win a writ of mandamus, which is an\n\n“extraordinary remedy.” Id. “The writ of mandamus is not a writ of right,” and even if the\n\nplaintiff has shown a clear ministerial duty on the part of the public officer, a court nevertheless\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\fmay, in its discretion, refuse to issue the writ if the court is unconvinced the writ would\n\naccomplish “substantial justice” outweighing the disruption the writ might cause.

Similarly,\n\nit must appear that the petitioner for a writ of certiorari has suffered a “substantial injury or\n\ninjustice.” Stratton, 133 Ill. 2d at 428.\n\n\n\n¶ 101                                       III.
