(2) the trial court\r\nconsidered Sandra’s standard of living in awarding child support and did not\r\nset forth its reasoning for awarding child support above the statutory\r\nguidelines; and (3) the award of child support constitutes a prohibited\r\ndouble recovery for Sandra.  Sandra counters that this court does not have\r\njurisdiction to hear the appeal because James consented to entry of the Order. \r\nWe hold that we have jurisdiction over the appeal and affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><i>Background</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">James and Sandra divorced in 2005.  They have three\r\nchildren of the marriage, and James has one minor child from a previous\r\nmarriage.  Under the divorce decree, to which the parties agreed, the court\r\nordered James to pay Sandra monthly child support of $2,000 from October 1,\r\n2005 forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">James filed this lawsuit seeking modification of several\r\nprovisions of the divorce decree, regarding possession and access, choice of\r\nnannies, life insurance policies, and the children’s passports, and seeking a\r\npermanent injunction.  At trial, James requested dismissal of his request for\r\ninjunctive relief, which the trial court granted.  Sandra brought a\r\ncounterclaim asking the court to increase child support.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The case was tried to the bench.  During trial, both\r\nparties agreed to the modifications sought by James; thus, the primary issue at\r\ntrial was child support.  Sandra testified that the children’s needs had increased\r\nsince the divorce decree was entered as the children had gotten older.  James’s\r\ncounsel admitted at trial that James makes more than $50,000 per month which\r\nwas a material and substantial change in circumstances.  Sandra sought child\r\nsupport from James at trial of $10,000 per month plus 100% of the uninsured\r\nmedical expenses for the children.  Sandra presented as an exhibit a chart\r\nentitled “Allocation of Cost Needs of the Children,” which she testified\r\nrepresented the children’s monthly expenses, totaling $14,129.13.  The document\r\nalso allocated monthly expenses between Sandra and the children.  The trial\r\ncourt found that the children’s needs were $5,366.87 per month, including $3,313.74\r\nover the amount of child support computed by the percentage guidelines set\r\nforth in the Family Code, and that James and Sandra were each responsible for\r\npaying 50% of the children’s excess needs, or $1,656.87.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The trial court found true the material allegations in\r\nboth James’s petition and Sandra’s counterpetition and signed the Order, which,\r\namong other things, requires James to pay Sandra child support of $3,710 per\r\nmonth<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\nand includes findings, in pertinent part, that James has net resources of\r\n$50,000 per month, the amount of Sandra’s net resources per month is unclear,\r\nand both Sandra and James are expected to support the children.  The court\r\nspecified that the amount of child support varies from the statutory guidelines\r\nbecause, among other things, James earns above guideline income, Sandra is\r\nintentionally unemployed or underemployed with an unknown income and her\r\nexpenses are “grossly overstated,” and the shortage of the children’s needs\r\nabove guideline support is $3,313.74.  The trial court also awarded Sandra\r\nretroactive child support of $10,570, but applied a credit of $5,290.64, and\r\nordered James to pay the balance of $5,279.36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The trial court subsequently entered Additional Findings\r\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law.  The trial court found, among other things: </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>To support her increase in child support, Sandra testified, in\r\npart, to spending $400.00 for “pole dancing classes”; she has been unemployed,\r\nexcept for a brief period, since 2008; has made limited effort to become\r\nemployed; currently conducts a dog breeding business in her home; spends\r\n$1,300.00 monthly for daycare even when she is at home during the children’s\r\nsummer vacation; has not paid the $3,859.16 monthly house payment in more than\r\na year; the children’s needs totaled in excess of $14,000 monthly; and\r\nrequested $10,000.00 monthly child support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>Mickey[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>]\r\npays other expenses of the children and of Sandra that are not reflected in the\r\nchild support calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>Even though Sandra has not paid house payments and only\r\nsporadically paid other necessities such as utilities, the children still need\r\nthe benefit of necessaries[.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><i>Jurisdiction</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We address as an initial matter Sandra’s contention that\r\nthis court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because James approved the Order\r\nas to form and substance, thus, as Sandra asserts, making the Order a consent\r\njudgment.  For a judgment to be considered an agreed or consent judgment, such\r\nthat no appeal can be taken therefrom, either the body of the judgment itself\r\nor the record must indicate that the parties came to some agreement as to the\r\ncase’s disposition; simple approval of the form and substance of the judgment\r\ndoes not suffice.  <i>DeClaris Assocs. v. McCoy Workplace Solutions, L.P.</i>,\r\n331 S.W.3d 556, 560 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).  Here,\r\nthere is no indication in the body of the Order or otherwise in the record that\r\nthe parties agreed to the case’s disposition with regard to child support.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span>  In fact, whether\r\nchild support should be increased and in what amount was vigorously contested\r\nthroughout the proceedings, including trial.  <i>See id</i>.  Consequently,\r\nJames did not abandon his right to appeal by signing the Order, and this court\r\nhas jurisdiction over the appeal.  <i>See id</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><i>Abuse of Discretion</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In five issues, James argues that the trial court abused\r\nits discretion by ordering child support above the statutory guidelines in the Family\r\nCode because (1) Sandra did not present evidence of a material and substantial\r\nchange in circumstances or that the children had unmet needs, (2) the trial\r\ncourt improperly considered Sandra’s lifestyle in increasing child support and\r\ndid not specifically delineate what needs it credited to support the child\r\nsupport award; and (3) the child support award constitutes a double recovery to\r\nSandra.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We review a trial court’s determination of child support\r\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard.  <i>Newberry v. Bohn-Newberry</i>, 146\r\nS.W.3d 233, 235 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.); <i>Evans v.\r\nEvans,</i> 14 S.W.3d 343, 345–46 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no\r\npet.).  A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily,\r\nunreasonably, or without reference to any guiding rules or principles.  <i>Newberry</i>,\r\n146 S.W.3d at 235.  Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, legal and factual\r\nsufficiency challenges are not independent grounds of error, but are relevant\r\nfactors in assessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.  <i>Id.</i>;\r\n<i>Zieba v. Martin</i>, 928 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\r\n1996, no writ).  When an appellant alleges the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion because the evidence is insufficient, this court employs a two prong\r\ntest.  <i>Newberry</i>, 146 S.W.3d at 235.  First, we must ask whether the\r\ntrial court had sufficient information on which to exercise its discretion, and\r\nsecond, we determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by causing\r\nthe child support order to be manifestly unjust or unfair.  <i>Id.</i>; <i>Evans</i>,\r\n14 S.W.3d at 346.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The trial court does not abuse its discretion when it\r\nbases its decision on conflicting evidence or when some evidence of a probative\r\nand substantive character exists to support the child support order.  <i>Newberry</i>\r\n146 S.W.3d at 235; <i>Zieba</i>, 928 S.W.2d at 787.  Conversely, a trial court does\r\nabuse its discretion when there is no evidence to support its decision.  <i>Anderson\r\nv. Carranza</i>, No. 14-10-00600-CV, 2011 WL 1631792, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] Apr. 28, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.).  In conducting our review, we\r\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s decision and\r\nindulge every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court’s judgment.  <i>Newberry</i>,\r\n146 S.W.3d at 235.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>1.<span>      </span></b><b>Material\r\nand Substantial Change of Circumstances</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In his first issue, James argues that the trial court\r\nabused its discretion by modifying the child support order because Sandra\r\nfailed to show a material and substantial change of circumstances since entry\r\nof the divorce decree.  Sandra counters that James conceded a material and\r\nsubstantial change of circumstances and, regardless, Sandra presented sufficient\r\nevidence showing the children’s needs have increased since the divorce.  We\r\nagree with Sandra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A court may modify a child support order “if the\r\ncircumstances of the child or a person affected by the order have materially\r\nand substantially changed since . . . the date of the order’s rendition.”  Tex.\r\nFam. Code § 156.401(a)(1)(A).  To determine whether modification of child\r\nsupport is warranted, the court must examine and compare the circumstances of\r\nthe parents and any minor children at the time of the initial order with the\r\ncircumstances existing at the time of trial in the modification suit.  <i>In re\r\nD.S.</i>, 76 S.W.3d 512, 520 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.).  The\r\nrecord should contain both historical and current evidence of the relevant\r\nperson’s financial circumstances.  <i>London v. London</i>, 192 S.W.3d 6, 15\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).<i>  </i>But a court’s\r\ndetermination as to whether a material change of circumstances has occurred is\r\nnot guided by rigid or definite rules and is fact-specific.  <i>In re A.L.E.</i>,\r\n279 S.W.3d 424, 428 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.).  A\r\nbreakdown of the children’s expenses at the time of the initial order and at\r\nthe time of the modification hearing is not necessary to show a material and\r\nsubstantial change of circumstances when evidence shows a substantial increase\r\nin the designated expenses for the children, in the absence of showing any\r\ndecrease in expenses.  <i>Arndt v. Arndt</i>, 685 S.W.2d 769, 770 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, no writ); <i>see also In re Marriage of Hamer</i>,\r\n906 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1995, no writ) (acknowledging that as\r\nchildren grow into teenagers, their expenses increase); <i>Sheldon v. Marshall</i>,\r\n768 S.W.2d 852, 856 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1989, no writ) (“[A]n increase in the\r\nneeds of Daughter is sufficient to justify an increase in support if Father is\r\nable to pay.”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A judicial admission is a formal waiver of proof usually\r\nfound in pleadings or the parties’ stipulations.  <i>Aguirre v. Vasquez</i>,\r\n225 S.W.3d 744, 756 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.).  A judicial\r\nadmission is conclusive on the party making it and relieves the opposing party\r\nof its burden of proving the admitted fact.  <i>Id</i>.  The admission must be\r\nclear and unequivocal.  <i>Holy Cross Church of God in Christ v. Wolf</i>, 44\r\nS.W.3d 562, 568 (Tex. 2001).  Any fact so admitted is conclusively established\r\nin the case without the introduction of the pleading or presentation of other\r\nevidence.  <i>Aguirre</i>, 225 S.W.3d at 756.  It not only relieves the\r\nopposing party from proving the admitted fact but bars the admitting party from\r\ndisputing it.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span> \r\n<i>Id</i>.  The policy underlying this rule is that it would be unjust to\r\npermit a party to recover after it has negated its right to recover by clear,\r\nunequivocal evidence.  <i>Id.</i> at 756–57.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At trial, James’s counsel agreed numerous times to\r\nstipulate that James made over $50,000 per month at the time of trial.  James’s\r\ncounsel also clearly, unequivocally, and adamantly asserted that this fact\r\nshowed a material and substantial change in James’s circumstances and Sandra\r\nneeded to focus only on proving the needs of the children:  “But the case law,\r\nYour Honor, this is the situation, has there been a material and substantial\r\nchange.  It’s their burden.  We stipulate that there has been.”  In objecting\r\nto the admission of evidence including James’s bank statements and income, James’s\r\ncounsel stated that Sandra’s counsel “has finally agreed to our stipulation\r\nthat our client makes over $50,000 a month in child support.  And under 156\r\nunder modification, once that’s established, <i>then the burden shifts to\r\nproving needs</i> . . . .”  (Emphasis added.)  We hold that, under these\r\ncircumstances, James judicially admitted a material and substantial change in\r\nhis financial circumstances, relieved Sandra of proving that fact, and is\r\nbarred from disputing it.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span> \r\n<i>See</i> <i>Aguirre</i>, 225 S.W.3d at 756; <i>see also Baucom v. Crews</i>,\r\n819 S.W.2d 628, 631 (Tex. App.—Waco 1991, no writ) (“Baucom himself pleaded\r\nthat a material and substantial change in his circumstances had occurred\r\nsufficient to warrant a decrease in his monthly child-support obligations.  His\r\npleadings constitute a judicial admission that there has been a substantial and\r\nmaterial change of his circumstances.”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sandra also presented evidence of a material and\r\nsubstantial change in the children’s circumstances. When the divorce decree was\r\nentered, the children were seven-, four-, and two-years-old.  When the Order\r\nwas entered, the children were twelve-, nine-, and seven-years-old, so the two\r\nyoungest had grown from pre-school- to school-aged children.  Sandra testified\r\nthat as the children have gotten older, their needs have increased.  They are\r\ninvolved in more extracurricular activities and eat out more often, the cost of\r\ngroceries has increased, the children have a greater need for a tutor due to\r\ntheir special needs,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span>\r\nand gasoline is not only more expensive but there is a greater need for it, as\r\nthe children must be transported to their extracurricular activities.  We hold\r\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a material and\r\nsubstantial change in circumstances that would merit an increase in child\r\nsupport.  <i>See</i> <i>Arndt</i>, 685 S.W.2d at 770.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We overrule James’s first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>2.<span>      </span></b><b>Unmet\r\nNeeds of the Children</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In his second issue, James contends that the trial court\r\nabused its discretion by increasing his child support obligation because Sandra\r\nfailed to prove that the children had unmet needs.  Specifically, James\r\ncomplains about the amount of child support Sandra sought for nanny expenses,\r\ntutorial expenses and private school tuition, birthday parties, extracurricular\r\nactivities, over-the-counter medicine, and food and groceries.  Because the\r\ntrial court clearly took into account the amount of child support sought,\r\nweighed that against the evidence of the children’s needs, and, finding that\r\nthe expenses claimed by Sandra were “grossly overstated,” significantly reduced\r\nthe amount of child support awarded as compared to that sought, we decline to\r\nfind that the trial court abused its discretion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once the court determines a material and substantial\r\nchange has occurred, the extent of the alteration of the amount of child\r\nsupport also lies within the court’s discretion.  <i>Nordstrom v. Nordstrom</i>,\r\n965 S.W.2d 575, 578 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied).  The Family\r\nCode provides a bifurcated analysis in setting child support, depending on\r\nwhether an obligor has net monthly resources above or below $7,500.  Tex. Fam.\r\nCode §§ 154.125, 154.126; <i>see Nordstrom</i>, 965 S.W.2d<i> </i>at 579. \r\nIf the obligor’s net monthly resources are below $7,500, the court must apply a\r\npresumptive award based on a percentage of the obligor’s net resources and the\r\nnumber of children.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 154.125.  But Family Code section\r\n154.126(a) grants the court discretion to order additional amounts over and\r\nabove the presumptive award when the obligor’s net monthly resources exceed\r\n$7,500, depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the\r\nchild.  Tex. Fam. Code § 154.126(a); <i>see also London</i>, 192 S.W.3d at 15. \r\nIf the court awards more than the guideline amount, subsection (b) requires\r\nthat the court first determine the proven needs of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code\r\n§ 154.126(b).  If the needs of the child exceed the presumptive award, the\r\ncourt must subtract the presumptive award from those needs.  <i>Id</i>.  The\r\ncourt must then allocate between the parties the responsibility to meet the\r\nadditional needs of the child, depending on the circumstances of the parties.  <i>Id</i>.\r\n However, the court is forbidden from requiring the obligor to pay more than\r\n100% of the proven needs of the child.  <i>Id</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What constitutes “needs” of the child has not been\r\ndefined by statute or by case law.  <i>See Rodriguez v. Rodriguez</i>, 860\r\nS.W.2d 414, 417 n.3 (Tex. 1993). However, the needs of the child are not\r\nlimited to the “bare necessities of life.”  <i>Id</i>.  In evaluating the needs\r\nof the child, and, thus, the exercise of the court’s discretion in determining\r\nthose needs, we are guided by the paramount principle in child support\r\ndecisions: the best interest of the child.  <i>Id</i>.  Thus, the Family Code\r\ngives an expansive view of the needs of a child and does not require the trial\r\ncourt to delineate every need of the child.  <i>Scott v. Younts</i>, 926 S.W.2d\r\n415, 421, 423 (Tex.

Fam. Code § 156.405.  In determining whether\r\napplication of the statutory guideline amounts would be unjust or inappropriate,\r\na trial court must consider “the amount of the obligee’s net resources,\r\nincluding the earning potential of the obligee if the actual income of the\r\nobligee is significantly less than what the obligee could earn because the\r\nobligee is intentionally unemployed or underemployed.”  Tex.

(2) had\r\n“grossly overstated” the children’s expenses; (3) spent $400 on “pole dancing\r\nclasses”; (4) had “made limited effort to become employed”; (5) spent\r\n$1,300 per month on daycare even when she was at home; and (6) had not made house\r\npayments in over a year.  But the court concluded that “[e]ven discounting\r\nSandra’s personal expenses,” the children’s needs were substantially more than\r\nthe presumptive amount.  And despite Sandra’s unemployment status, the court\r\nordered Sandra and James to split the cost of the children’s needs over the\r\npresumptive amount.  We hold that the trial court did not increase the child\r\nsupport award to support Sandra’s lifestyle, but instead based the award on the\r\nproper factors set forth in the Family Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We overrule James’s third issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>4.<span>      </span></b><b>The\r\nTrial Court’s Findings </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In his fourth issue, James complains that the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion by failing to delineate what proven needs it\r\ncredited to support the Order.  We disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Family Code sets out exactly what the trial court\r\nmust include in its findings in rendering a child support order:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">[T]he\r\ncourt shall state whether the application of the guidelines would be unjust or\r\ninappropriate and shall state the following in the child support order:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(1) the net resources\r\nof the obligor per month are $__________;

(2) the trial court\r\nconsidered Sandra’s standard of living in awarding child support and did not\r\nset forth its reasoning for awarding child support above the statutory\r\nguidelines; and (3) the award of child support constitutes a prohibited\r\ndouble recovery for Sandra.  Sandra counters that this court does not have\r\njurisdiction to hear the appeal because James consented to entry of the Order. \r\nWe hold that we have jurisdiction over the appeal and affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><i>Background</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">James and Sandra divorced in 2005.  They have three\r\nchildren of the marriage, and James has one minor child from a previous\r\nmarriage.  Under the divorce decree, to which the parties agreed, the court\r\nordered James to pay Sandra monthly child support of $2,000 from October 1,\r\n2005 forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">James filed this lawsuit seeking modification of several\r\nprovisions of the divorce decree, regarding possession and access, choice of\r\nnannies, life insurance policies, and the children’s passports, and seeking a\r\npermanent injunction.  At trial, James requested dismissal of his request for\r\ninjunctive relief, which the trial court granted.  Sandra brought a\r\ncounterclaim asking the court to increase child support.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The case was tried to the bench.  During trial, both\r\nparties agreed to the modifications sought by James; thus, the primary issue at\r\ntrial was child support.  Sandra testified that the children’s needs had increased\r\nsince the divorce decree was entered as the children had gotten older.  James’s\r\ncounsel admitted at trial that James makes more than $50,000 per month which\r\nwas a material and substantial change in circumstances.  Sandra sought child\r\nsupport from James at trial of $10,000 per month plus 100% of the uninsured\r\nmedical expenses for the children.  Sandra presented as an exhibit a chart\r\nentitled “Allocation of Cost Needs of the Children,” which she testified\r\nrepresented the children’s monthly expenses, totaling $14,129.13.  The document\r\nalso allocated monthly expenses between Sandra and the children.  The trial\r\ncourt found that the children’s needs were $5,366.87 per month, including $3,313.74\r\nover the amount of child support computed by the percentage guidelines set\r\nforth in the Family Code, and that James and Sandra were each responsible for\r\npaying 50% of the children’s excess needs, or $1,656.87.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The trial court found true the material allegations in\r\nboth James’s petition and Sandra’s counterpetition and signed the Order, which,\r\namong other things, requires James to pay Sandra child support of $3,710 per\r\nmonth<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\nand includes findings, in pertinent part, that James has net resources of\r\n$50,000 per month, the amount of Sandra’s net resources per month is unclear,\r\nand both Sandra and James are expected to support the children.  The court\r\nspecified that the amount of child support varies from the statutory guidelines\r\nbecause, among other things, James earns above guideline income, Sandra is\r\nintentionally unemployed or underemployed with an unknown income and her\r\nexpenses are “grossly overstated,” and the shortage of the children’s needs\r\nabove guideline support is $3,313.74.  The trial court also awarded Sandra\r\nretroactive child support of $10,570, but applied a credit of $5,290.64, and\r\nordered James to pay the balance of $5,279.36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The trial court subsequently entered Additional Findings\r\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law.  The trial court found, among other things: </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>To support her increase in child support, Sandra testified, in\r\npart, to spending $400.00 for “pole dancing classes”;

has not paid the $3,859.16 monthly house payment in more than\r\na year; the children’s needs totaled in excess of $14,000 monthly; and\r\nrequested $10,000.00 monthly child support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>Mickey[<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>]\r\npays other expenses of the children and of Sandra that are not reflected in the\r\nchild support calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><span>·<span>                   \r\n</span></span>Even though Sandra has not paid house payments and only\r\nsporadically paid other necessities such as utilities, the children still need\r\nthe benefit of necessaries[.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><i>Jurisdiction</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We address as an initial matter Sandra’s contention that\r\nthis court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because James approved the Order\r\nas to form and substance, thus, as Sandra asserts, making the Order a consent\r\njudgment.  For a judgment to be considered an agreed or consent judgment, such\r\nthat no appeal can be taken therefrom, either the body of the judgment itself\r\nor the record must indicate that the parties came to some agreement as to the\r\ncase’s disposition; simple approval of the form and substance of the judgment\r\ndoes not suffice.  <i>DeClaris Assocs. v.

Code § 156.401(a)(1)(A).  To determine whether modification of child\r\nsupport is warranted, the court must examine and compare the circumstances of\r\nthe parents and any minor children at the time of the initial order with the\r\ncircumstances existing at the time of trial in the modification suit.  <i>In re\r\nD.S.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335213\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335213/in-re-ds/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 520 (Tex.

When the divorce decree was\r\nentered, the children were seven-, four-, and two-years-old.  When the Order\r\nwas entered, the children were twelve-, nine-, and seven-years-old, so the two\r\nyoungest had grown from pre-school- to school-aged children.  Sandra testified\r\nthat as the children have gotten older, their needs have increased.  They are\r\ninvolved in more extracurricular activities and eat out more often, the cost of\r\ngroceries has increased, the children have a greater need for a tutor due to\r\ntheir special needs,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span>\r\nand gasoline is not only more expensive but there is a greater need for it, as\r\nthe children must be transported to their extracurricular activities.  We hold\r\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a material and\r\nsubstantial change in circumstances that would merit an increase in child\r\nsupport.  <i>See</i> <i>Arndt</i>, 685 S.W.2d at 770.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We overrule James’s first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>2.<span>      </span></b><b>Unmet\r\nNeeds of the Children</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In his second issue, James contends that the trial court\r\nabused its discretion by increasing his child support obligation because Sandra\r\nfailed to prove that the children had unmet needs.  Specifically, James\r\ncomplains about the amount of child support Sandra sought for nanny expenses,\r\ntutorial expenses and private school tuition, birthday parties, extracurricular\r\nactivities, over-the-counter medicine, and food and groceries.  Because the\r\ntrial court clearly took into account the amount of child support sought,\r\nweighed that against the evidence of the children’s needs, and, finding that\r\nthe expenses claimed by Sandra were “grossly overstated,” significantly reduced\r\nthe amount of child support awarded as compared to that sought, we decline to\r\nfind that the trial court abused its discretion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once the court determines a material and substantial\r\nchange has occurred, the extent of the alteration of the amount of child\r\nsupport also lies within the court’s discretion.  <i>Nordstrom v.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied).  The Family\r\nCode provides a bifurcated analysis in setting child support, depending on\r\nwhether an obligor has net monthly resources above or below $7,500.  Tex. Fam.\r\nCode §§ 154.125, 154.126; <i>see Nordstrom</i>, 965 S.W.2d<i> </i>at 579. \r\nIf the obligor’s net monthly resources are below $7,500, the court must apply a\r\npresumptive award based on a percentage of the obligor’s net resources and the\r\nnumber of children.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 154.125.  But Family Code section\r\n154.126(a) grants the court discretion to order additional amounts over and\r\nabove the presumptive award when the obligor’s net monthly resources exceed\r\n$7,500, depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the\r\nchild.  Tex. Fam. Code § 154.126(a); <i>see also London</i>, 192 S.W.3d at 15. \r\nIf the court awards more than the guideline amount, subsection (b) requires\r\nthat the court first determine the proven needs of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code\r\n§ 154.126(b).  If the needs of the child exceed the presumptive award, the\r\ncourt must subtract the presumptive award from those needs.  <i>Id</i>.  The\r\ncourt must then allocate between the parties the responsibility to meet the\r\nadditional needs of the child, depending on the circumstances of the parties.  <i>Id</i>.\r\n However, the court is forbidden from requiring the obligor to pay more than\r\n100% of the proven needs of the child.  <i>Id</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What constitutes “needs” of the child has not been\r\ndefined by statute or by case law.  <i>See Rodriguez v.

However, the needs of the child are not\r\nlimited to the “bare necessities of life.”  <i>Id</i>.  In evaluating the needs\r\nof the child, and, thus, the exercise of the court’s discretion in determining\r\nthose needs, we are guided by the paramount principle in child support\r\ndecisions: the best interest of the child.  <i>Id</i>.  Thus, the Family Code\r\ngives an expansive view of the needs of a child and does not require the trial\r\ncourt to delineate every need of the child.  <i>Scott v.

(2) had\r\n“grossly overstated” the children’s expenses; (3) spent $400 on “pole dancing\r\nclasses”; (4) had “made limited effort to become employed”; (5) spent\r\n$1,300 per month on daycare even when she was at home; and (6) had not made house\r\npayments in over a year.  But the court concluded that “[e]ven discounting\r\nSandra’s personal expenses,” the children’s needs were substantially more than\r\nthe presumptive amount.  And despite Sandra’s unemployment status, the court\r\nordered Sandra and James to split the cost of the children’s needs over the\r\npresumptive amount.  We hold that the trial court did not increase the child\r\nsupport award to support Sandra’s lifestyle, but instead based the award on the\r\nproper factors set forth in the Family Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We overrule James’s third issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>4.<span>      </span></b><b>The\r\nTrial Court’s Findings </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In his fourth issue, James complains that the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion by failing to delineate what proven needs it\r\ncredited to support the Order.  We disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Family Code sets out exactly what the trial court\r\nmust include in its findings in rendering a child support order:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">[T]he\r\ncourt shall state whether the application of the guidelines would be unjust or\r\ninappropriate and shall state the following in the child support order:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“(1) the net resources\r\nof the obligor per month are $__________;
