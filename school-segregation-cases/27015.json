Code, § 6600 et seq.).2 This court rejected all but one of his challenges to\nthe order of commitment and remanded the case “for the limited purpose of reconsidering\nWelch’s equal protection claim in light of [People v.] McKee [(2010) 47 Cal.4th 1172\n(McKee I)”] once the proceedings in that case became final. (People v. Welch\n(Apr. 3, 2012, H035567) [nonpub. opn.] (Welch I).) The California Supreme Court\n\n\n1\n       The SVPA was amended effective June 27, 2012 to reflect that the Department of\nMental Health is now the Department of State Hospitals (DSH). (Stats. 2012, ch. 24,\n§§ 63, 65, 138-146, pp. 85, 117-124.)\n2\n      Further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise noted.\n\fdenied Welch’s petition for review. (Welch I, supra, review den. June 27, 2012,\nS202473.)\n       Meanwhile, the trial court on remand in McKee I held an evidentiary hearing on\nMcKee’s equal protection claim, rejected it, and committed him as an SVP. The Fourth\nDistrict Court of Appeal affirmed, and the California Supreme Court denied review.\n(People v. McKee (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1347-1348 (McKee II), review den.\nOct. 10, 2012, S204503.)\n       With the decision in McKee II final, the trial court committed Welch to the\ncustody of the DSH “as previously ordered.” Welch filed a timely notice of appeal from\nthe trial court’s November 9, 2012 order. He contends that (1) “McKee II is not binding\non [him] because he is dissimilarly situated from McKee and is entitled to his own\nevidentiary hearing” and that (2) “the McKee II court incorrectly applied the law\nregarding the alleged equal protection violation.” We affirm.\n\n\n                                       I. Background\n       Since the facts of Welch’s crimes are irrelevant to the issues he raises on appeal,\nwe do not repeat them.\n\n\n                                       II. Discussion\n                            A. The SVPA and Proposition 83\n       The SVPA provides for the involuntary civil commitment of persons found to be\nSVP’s beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. (People v. Williams (2003) 31 Cal.4th 757,\n764.) An SVP is “a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against\none or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a\ndanger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in\nsexually violent criminal behavior.” (§ 6600, subd. (a)(1).)\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       The SVPA as originally enacted provided for a two-year commitment, renewable\nfor successive terms if the People proved beyond a reasonable doubt at a new trial that\nthe committed person remained an SVP. (Former § 6604, Stats. 1995, ch. 763, § 3.)\nThere were two ways an SVP could obtain review of his or her current mental condition\nto determine if civil confinement was still necessary. (People v. Cheek (2001) 25 Cal.4th\n894, 898 (Cheek).) Former section 6608 permitted the SVP to petition, without the\nconcurrence of the DSH, for conditional release to a community treatment program.\n(Cheek, at p. 898.) Former section 6605, which called for an annual review of a\ncommitted SVP’s mental status, provided a procedure that, with the concurrence of the\nDSH, could lead to unconditional release. (Cheek, at p. 898.)\n       The SVPA was amended in 2006 by Proposition 83. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th\nat p. 1183.) Among other modifications, “Proposition 83 also change[d] an SVP\ncommitment from a two-year term to an indefinite commitment.” (McKee I, at p. 1186.)\nUnder the amended SVPA, “[a]n SVP can only be released conditionally or\nunconditionally if the [DSH] authorizes a petition for release and the state does not\noppose it or fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual still meets the\ndefinition of an SVP, or if the individual, petitioning the court on his own, is able to bear\nthe burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is no longer an SVP. In\nother words, the method of petitioning the court for release and proving fitness to be\nreleased, which under the former Act had been the way an SVP could cut short his two-\nyear commitment, now becomes the only means of being released from an indefinite\ncommitment when the [DSH] does not support release.” (McKee I, at pp. 1187-1188.)\n\n\n            B. Equal Protection and the McKee I and McKee II Decisions\n       Both the federal and state Constitutions guarantee the right to equal protection of\nthe laws. (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 7.) “ ‘ “ ‘The concept of the\nequal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly\n                                              3\n\fsituated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.’ ”\n[Citation.] “The first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause\nis a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly\nsituated groups in an unequal manner.” [Citations.]’ ” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\npp. 1218-1219.)\n       In McKee I, the California Supreme Court held that SVP’s, MDO’s (Pen. Code,\n§ 2960 et seq.), and NGI’s (Pen. Code, § 1026 et seq.) are similarly situated. (McKee I,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1203, 1207.) The court also concluded that McKee’s disparate\ntreatment claim required application of the strict scrutiny standard. (Id. at pp. 1197-\n1198.) “Because neither the People nor the court below properly understood this\nburden,” the McKee I court decided, the People would have an opportunity to make the\nappropriate showing on remand. (Id. at pp. 1207-1208.) “It must be shown that,\nnotwithstanding the similarities between SVP’s and MDO’s, the former as a class bear a\nsubstantially greater risk to society, and that therefore imposing on them a greater burden\nbefore they can be released from commitment is needed to protect society.” (Id. at\np. 1208.) This could be shown in a variety of ways, the court explained, including by\ndemonstrating that the “inherent nature of the SVP’s mental disorder” makes recidivism\nby SVP’s “significantly more likely” or that “SVP’s pose a greater risk to a particularly\nvulnerable class of victims.” (Ibid.) The court directed the People on remand “to justify\nProposition 83’s indefinite commitment provisions . . . and demonstrate that they are\nbased on a reasonable perception of the unique dangers that SVP’s pose rather than a\nspecial stigma that SVP’s may bear in the eyes of California’s electorate.” (Id. at\np. 1210.)\n       On remand, the trial court conducted a 21-day evidentiary hearing. (See McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1330.) Experts testified that SVP’s have a higher risk of\nrecidivism, that victims of sexual offenses suffer “unique and, in general, greater trauma”\nthan victims of nonsex offenses, and that SVP’s “are significantly different from MDO’s\n                                              4\n\fand NGI’s diagnostically and in treatment.” (Id. at pp. 1340-1347.) Concluding that this\njustified the disparate treatment of SVP’s, the trial court rejected McKee’s equal\nprotection claim. (McKee II, at p. 1330.)\n       The Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence de novo. (McKee II, supra, 207\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1340-1347.) The court concluded that “the People on remand met\ntheir burden to present substantial evidence, including medical and scientific evidence,\njustifying the amended Act’s disparate treatment of SVP’s (e.g., by imposing\nindeterminate terms of civil commitment and placing on them the burden to prove they\nshould be released). (McKee [I], supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1207.) The People have shown\nthat, ‘notwithstanding the similarities between SVP’s and MDO’s [and NGI’s], the\nformer as a class bear a substantially greater risk to society, and that therefore imposing\non them a greater burden before they can be released from commitment is needed to\nprotect society.’ (Id. at p. 1208.) The People have shown ‘that the inherent nature of the\nSVP’s mental disorder makes recidivism as a class significantly more likely[;] . . . that\nSVP’s pose a greater risk [and unique dangers] to a particularly vulnerable class of\nvictims, such as children’; and that SVP’s have diagnostic and treatment differences from\nMDO’s and NGI’s, thereby supporting a reasonable perception by the electorate that\npassed Proposition 83 that the disparate treatment of SVP’s under the amended Act is\nnecessary to further the state’s compelling interests in public safety and humanely\ntreating the mentally disordered. [Citation.]” (McKee II, at p. 1347.)\n\n\n                                 C. Welch’s Contentions\n       Welch contends that the McKee II court’s findings and conclusions bind only\nMcKee. He maintains that he has a due process right to present evidence and to argue at\ntrial that a life commitment cannot validly be imposed on him. We disagree.\n       Welch first argues that he and McKee are “dissimilarly situated” because his\nvictims were adult women while McKee’s victims were children. An argument based on\n                                              5\n\fthe same distinction was rejected in People v. McKnight (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 860\n(McKnight). We agree with the McKnight court that the analysis and holding in McKee II\ndo not turn on concerns specific to child predators. (McKnight, at p. 863; see McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347 [stating multiple bases for the court’s finding that\nSVP’s as a class bear a substantially greater risk to society, which warrants imposing a\ngreater burden on them before they can be released from commitment].)\n       Welch next argues that the California Supreme Court “did not purport to resolve\ndefinitively the constitutionality of the SVP law” but on the contrary “implicitly\ndetermined” in McKee I that an equal protection judgment must be made in each case on\nan as applied rather than a class basis. We disagree.\n       Other courts have rejected this argument, and properly so. (E.g., McKnight, supra,\n212 Cal.App.4th at pp. 863-864; People v. McDonald (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1367,\n1378 (McDonald).) As the McKnight court explained, the McKee I court “recognized\nthat the People could attempt to justify the Act’s disparate impact in a variety of ways,\nand that these included showing that SVP’s as a class are significantly more likely to\nreoffend than MDO’s or NGI’s, showing they pose a greater risk to children (in which\ncase the equal protection analysis would apply only to child predators), or by other,\nunspecified means. [Citation.] In light of that recognition, the Court transferred the\nmultiple ‘grant and hold’ cases under McKee I, including this one, to the Courts of\nAppeal with directions to vacate their prior opinions and suspend further proceedings\nuntil the McKee I remand proceedings were final, ‘in order to avoid an unnecessary\nmultiplicity of proceedings.’ [Citations.] On remand, McKee [II] concluded that\ndifferences between SVP’s as a class and other offenders justify their different treatment\nunder the Act. It is plain that McKee II is not to be restricted to [McKee] alone or only to\nthose SVP’s convicted of crimes against children . . . , but rather its holding applies to the\nclass of SVP’s as a whole.” (McKnight, at pp. 863-864; accord, McDonald, at p. 1378.)\nWe agree with the McKnight and McDonald courts’ conclusion that the high court’s\n                                              6\n\femphasis on classwide proof, together with its suspension of activity in grant-and-hold\ncases to avoid an unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings, demonstrates that it intended\nthe equal protection challenge to the amended SVPA be resolved on a class basis in\nMcKee II. (McKnight, at pp. 863-864; McDonald, at p. 1378.)\n       Welch next argues that the McKee II court improperly applied a deferential rather\nthan a de novo standard of review, as evidenced by its discussion of the applicable\nstandard, which “referred . . . three times to the ‘substantial evidence’ standard.” We\ndisagree.\n       A court applying the deferential substantial evidence standard of review “ ‘must\nview the evidence in a light most favorable to [the judgment] and presume in support of\nthe judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the\nevidence.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576; see Jackson v.\nVirginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318-320.) That is not what the McKee II court did here.\n       Addressing the standard of review, McKee II court stated that “McKee asserts, and\nwe agree, that we review de novo the trial court’s determination whether the Act, as\namended by Proposition 83, violates his equal protection rights. We independently\ndetermine whether the People presented substantial, factual evidence to support a\nreasonable perception that SVP’s pose a unique and/or greater danger to society than do\nMDO’s and NGI’s, thereby justifying the disparate treatment of SVP’s under the Act.”\n(McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1338, italics added.) The court rejected the\nPeople’s argument that it should defer to the trial court’s findings of historical fact and\ncredibility determinations. (Id. at p. 1338, fn. 3.) Observing that “the trial court’s\nstatement of decision did not make any express findings regarding disputed historical\nfacts or the credibility of certain witnesses,” the court declared that it was “in as good a\nposition as the trial court to decide whether the evidence presented by the People during\nthe remand hearing satisfied their burden to justify the disparate treatment of SVP’s\nunder the Act.” (Ibid., italics added.) The court ultimately agreed with the trial court that\n                                              7\n\fthe People had produced substantial evidence to justify the disparate treatment. (Id. at\npp. 1330-1331.) The McKee II court’s review was plainly de novo.\n       The McKee II court’s statement that “[i]n independently reviewing the evidence\nadmitted at the remand hearing, we must determine whether the People presented\nsubstantial evidence to support a reasonable inference or perception that the Act’s\ndisparate treatment of SVP’s is necessary to further compelling state interests” does not\ncompel a contrary conclusion. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1339.) The\nquoted statement’s reference to “substantial evidence” reflects nothing more than the\nMcKee II court’s adherence to the standard the high court directed it to follow. In McKee\nI, the high court explained that “[w]hen a constitutional right, such as the right to liberty\nfrom involuntary confinement, is at stake, the usual judicial deference to legislative\nfindings gives way to an exercise of independent judgment of the facts to ascertain\nwhether the legislative body ‘ “has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial\nevidence.” ’ [Citations.]” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1206-1207.) The McKee II\ncourt followed this standard.\n       Welch next complains that the McKee II court applied a rational basis rather than a\nstrict scrutiny test. We disagree.\n       In McKee I, the high court directed the trial court to apply the equal protection\nprinciples articulated in In re Moye (1978) 22 Cal.3d 457 (Moye) and related cases\ndiscussed in McKee I to determine whether the People “can demonstrate the\nconstitutional justification for imposing on SVP’s a greater burden than is imposed on\nMDO’s and NGI’s in order to obtain release from commitment.” (McKee I, supra, 47\nCal.4th at pp. 1208-1209.) In Moye, which involved an equal protection challenge to a\ncivil commitment statute, the high court articulated the strict scrutiny standard as follows:\n“[T]he state must establish both that it has a ‘compelling interest’ which justifies the\nchallenged procedure and that the distinctions drawn by the procedure are necessary to\nfurther that interest.” (Moye, at p. 465.)\n                                              8\n\f       The McKee II court applied that standard. It independently reviewed the evidence\nand concluded that the People had shown that the legislative distinctions between classes\nof persons subject to civil commitment were reasonable and factually based. (McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347.) Specifically, the People had shown that recidivism\namong SVP’s as a class is more likely than among either MDO’s or NGI’s, that SVP’s\npose a greater risk to a particularly vulnerable class of victims, and that they have\n“significantly different diagnoses” and significantly different treatment plans,\ncompliance, and success rates than MDO’s and NGI’s have. (McKee II, at p. 1347.) The\ncourt concluded that these distinctions justified disparate treatment, which was\n“necessary to further the state’s compelling interests in public safety and humanely\ntreating the mentally disordered.” (Ibid.) This satisfied the strict scrutiny standard.\n       Welch argues, however, that “[t]he portion of the opinion addressing the [trial\ncourt’s] three factual findings does not use language indicating [that] ‘the state has a\ncompelling interest in treating the three classes differently.’ ” The argument lacks merit.\nThe McKee II court expressly stated that the significant differences between the three\nclasses “support[ed] a reasonable perception by the electorate . . . that the disparate\ntreatment of SVP’s under the amended Act is necessary to further the state’s compelling\ninterests in public safety and humanely treating the mentally disordered.” (McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347, italics added.)\n       Welch also argues that strict scrutiny “requires an analysis of whether the different\ntreatment of the classes is actually necessary.” We disagree.\n       The People were not required to show that SVP’s are actually more dangerous as a\nclass. In remanding the case, the McKee I court stated that “the government will have an\nopportunity to justify Proposition 83’s indefinite commitment provisions . . . , and\ndemonstrate that they are based on a reasonable perception of the unique dangers that\nSVP’s pose rather than a special stigma that SVP’s may bear in the eyes of California’s\nelectorate. [¶] Moreover, we emphasize that mere disagreement among experts will not\n                                              9\n\fsuffice to overturn the Proposition 83 amendments. The trial court must determine\nwhether the legislative distinctions in classes of persons subject to civil commitment are\nreasonable and factually based—not whether they are incontrovertible or\nuncontroversial.” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1210-1211, fn. omitted, italics\nadded.) The McKee II court relied on evidence that scores on the Static-99 test, which\nassesses the risk that a sex offender will commit sex offenses, were significantly higher\nfor SVP’s than for MDO’s and NGI’s. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1340-\n1342.) It complied with the high court’s directions.\n       Welch next complains that the evidentiary hearing in McKee II improperly\nfocused on evidence that was “irrelevant to a correct strict scrutiny analysis”—i.e., on\nevidence that lawmakers might have considered before enacting Proposition 83 and the\namended SVPA. “The only evidence any court should have been reviewing,” Welch\nasserts, “was that showing the actual intent of the voters who passed Proposition 83 and\nthe [L]egislature that passed S.B. 1128.” We disagree.\n       Welch’s reliance on Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan (1982) 458 U.S.\n718 (MUW) and United States v. Virginia (1996) 518 U.S. 515 (Virginia) is misplaced.\nThose cases stand for the proposition that parties seeking to defend gender-based\ngovernment action must demonstrate an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for that\naction. (MUW, at pp. 728-730 [holding that university’s female-only admissions policy,\nas applied to males seeking admission to the university’s school of nursing, violated\nequal protection where, “although the State recited a ‘benign, compensatory purpose,’ it\nfailed to establish that the alleged objective [wa]s the actual purpose underlying the\ndiscriminatory classification,” italics added]; Virginia, at pp. 534-536 [noting that “[i]n\ncases of this genre, our precedent instructs that ‘benign’ justifications proffered in\ndefense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable\njustification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact\ndifferently grounded,” and holding that the state had shown “no ‘exceedingly persuasive\n                                             10\n\fjustification’ for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI.”\n(Italics added)].) MUW and Virginia are inapposite because the government action\nchallenged in McKee II (and here) is not based on gender or any other suspect\nclassification.3\n        Welch next contends that the McKee II court “should have required that the\nSVPA amendments be narrowly tailored to serve their purported purpose.” Asserting\nthat “authority for that proposition is abundant,” he criticizes the McKee II court for\nstating “that McKee failed to cite any authority requiring that such a law be narrowly\ntailored.”\n       McKee cited Bernal v. Fainter (1984) 467 U.S. 216 to support his argument.\n(McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1349.) In Bernal, the United States Supreme\nCourt stated that “[i]n order to withstand strict scrutiny, the law must advance a\ncompelling state interest by the least restrictive means available.” (Bernal, at p. 219.)\nThe McKee II court described the quoted sentence from Bernal as “probable dictum,”\ndistinguishing Bernal because it involved a suspect class, alienage. (McKee II, at\np. 1349.) “We are unaware of any case applying the ‘least restrictive means available’\nrequirement to all cases involving disparate treatment of similarly situated classes,” the\nMcKee II court wrote. (Ibid.) “On the contrary, our review of equal protection case law\nshows the two-part test, as discussed in Moye and McKee [I], is the prevailing\n\n\n3\n       Shaw v. Hunt (1996) 517 U.S. 899 (Shaw), Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong (1976)\n426 U.S. 88 (Wong), and Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld (1975) 420 U.S. 636 (Wiesenfeld), on\nwhich Welch also relies, are inapposite for the same reason. (Shaw, at pp. 902, 915\n[North Carolina redistricting scheme, which segregated voters into “separate and bizarre-\nlooking districts on the basis of race,” violated equal protection where “the remedy . . .\n[wa]s not narrowly tailored to the asserted end.”]; Wong, at pp. 115-116 [invalidating, as\nviolative of equal protection, Civil Service Commission regulations excluding most\nnoncitizens from most federal employment positions]; Wiesenfeld, at pp. 638-639, 645,\n648 [invalidating, as violative of equal protection, gender-based distinction granting\nSocial Security survivor’s benefits to widows but not to widowers].)\n\n                                             11\n\fstandard. . . . Therefore, in strict scrutiny cases, the government must show both a\ncompelling state interest justifying the disparate treatment and that the disparate\ntreatment is necessary to further that compelling state interest. [Citations.] We are\nunpersuaded the electorate that passed Proposition 83 in 2006 was required to adopt the\nleast restrictive means available (e.g., a two-year or other determinate term of civil\ncommitment) in disparately treating SVP’s and furthering the compelling state interests\nof public safety and humane treatment of the mentally disordered.” (McKee II, at\np. 1349.)\n       We agree with the McKee II court’s analysis of this issue. We note that Moye, like\nMcKee II and like this case, involved an equal protection challenge to a civil commitment\nstatute. The high court in McKee I specifically instructed the trial court, on remand, to\n“determine whether the People, applying the equal protection principles articulated in\nMoye and related cases discussed in the [McKee I court’s] opinion,” could demonstrate\nthat imposing a greater burden on SVP’s than on MDO’s or NGI’s to obtain release from\nconfinement was necessary to promote the state’s compelling interest in public safety and\nhumane treatment of the mentally ill. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1208, italics\nadded.)\n       The cases Welch cites are inapposite. In Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942) 316 U.S.\n535 (Skinner), the United States Supreme Court reversed a judgment directing that the\ndefendant be sterilized under Oklahoma’s Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act, holding\nthat the statute violated equal protection. “[S]trict scrutiny of the classification which a\nState makes in a sterilization law is essential,” the court declared. (Skinner, at p. 541.)\n“When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same\nquality of offense [e.g. grand larceny and embezzlement] and sterilizes one and not the\nother, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or\nnationality for oppressive treatment.” (Ibid.) In United States v. Brandon (6th Cir. 1998)\n158 F.3d 947, 956 (Brandon), a nondangerous pretrial detainee challenged a district court\n                                              12\n\forder denying him a judicial hearing on whether he could be forcibly medicated with\nantipsychotic drugs to render him competent to stand trial. (Brandon, at p. 949.) Noting\nthat the issue involved the inmate’s First Amendment interest in avoiding forced\nmedication that could interfere with his ability to communicate ideas, his Fifth\nAmendment liberty interest in being free from bodily intrusion, and his Sixth\nAmendment right to a fair trial, the court concluded that due process considerations\nrequired a judicial hearing and that the district court should apply the strict scrutiny\nstandard on remand. (Brandon, at pp. 953-955, 957.) In Sanchez v. City of Modesto\n(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660, 678 (Sanchez), the court rejected a facial challenge to the\nCalifornia Voting Rights Act, holding that because the statute is nondiscriminatory, it is\nsubject to rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. (Sanchez, at p. 680.) None of these\ndecisions involved an equal protection challenge to a civil commitment statute. Moye\ndid, and the California Supreme Court specifically instructed that it be followed on\nremand in McKee. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1208.) The McKee II court did not\nerr in following the high court’s directive to apply the equal protection principles\narticulated in Moye.\n       Welch next contends that the McKee II court’s failure to distinguish In re Calhoun\n(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1315 (Calhoun) “demonstrates [that] its equal protection analysis\nis flawed and should be rejected.” We disagree.\n       In Calhoun, the court held that “[e]qual protection principles require that an SVP\nbe provided with the same right as an MDO to refuse antipsychotic medication.”\n(Calhoun, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1351.) The two groups were similarly situated\n“for purposes of the law concerning the right to refuse antipsychotic medication,” the\ncourt explained, and the People had failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest that\njustified a distinction between them in that regard. (Id. at pp. 1352-1354.)\n       Calhoun is easily distinguished. The equal protection issue in Calhoun turned on\nthe absence of differences between SVP’s and MDO’s with respect to the need for, and\n                                              13\n\fthe effectiveness of, antipsychotic medication. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1352.) The equal protection issue in McKee II, by contrast, turned on the differences\nbetween the two groups with respect to recidivism rates, dangerousness, and diagnoses\nand treatment. (Id. at pp. 1340-1347.) That the Calhoun court found no justification for\ntreating SVP’s and MDO’s differently with respect to forced medication does not mean\nthere can be no justification for treating them differently with respect to their release into\nsociety. The inquiries are entirely different.\n\n\n                                      III.

Discussion\n                            A. The SVPA and Proposition 83\n       The SVPA provides for the involuntary civil commitment of persons found to be\nSVP’s beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. (People v. Williams (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625326/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n764.) An SVP is “a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against\none or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a\ndanger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in\nsexually violent criminal behavior.” (§ 6600, subd. (a)(1).)\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       The SVPA as originally enacted provided for a two-year commitment, renewable\nfor successive terms if the People proved beyond a reasonable doubt at a new trial that\nthe committed person remained an SVP. (Former § 6604, Stats. 1995, ch. 763, § 3.)\nThere were two ways an SVP could obtain review of his or her current mental condition\nto determine if civil confinement was still necessary. (People v. Cheek (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2514254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2514254/people-v-cheek/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (Cheek).) Former section 6608 permitted the SVP to petition, without the\nconcurrence of the DSH, for conditional release to a community treatment program.\n(Cheek, at p. 898.) Former section 6605, which called for an annual review of a\ncommitted SVP’s mental status, provided a procedure that, with the concurrence of the\nDSH, could lead to unconditional release. (Cheek, at p. 898.)\n       The SVPA was amended in 2006 by Proposition 83. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th\nat p. 1183.) Among other modifications, “Proposition 83 also change[d] an SVP\ncommitment from a two-year term to an indefinite commitment.” (McKee I, at p. 1186.)\nUnder the amended SVPA, “[a]n SVP can only be released conditionally or\nunconditionally if the [DSH] authorizes a petition for release and the state does not\noppose it or fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual still meets the\ndefinition of an SVP, or if the individual, petitioning the court on his own, is able to bear\nthe burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is no longer an SVP. In\nother words, the method of petitioning the court for release and proving fitness to be\nreleased, which under the former Act had been the way an SVP could cut short his two-\nyear commitment, now becomes the only means of being released from an indefinite\ncommitment when the [DSH] does not support release.” (McKee I, at pp. 1187-1188.)\n\n\n            B. Equal Protection and the McKee I and McKee II Decisions\n       Both the federal and state Constitutions guarantee the right to equal protection of\nthe laws. (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 7.) “ ‘ “ ‘The concept of the\nequal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly\n                                              3\n\fsituated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.’ ”\n[Citation.] “The first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause\nis a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly\nsituated groups in an unequal manner.” [Citations.]’ ” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\npp. 1218-1219.)\n       In McKee I, the California Supreme Court held that SVP’s, MDO’s (Pen. Code,\n§ 2960 et seq.), and NGI’s (Pen. Code, § 1026 et seq.) are similarly situated. (McKee I,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1203, 1207.) The court also concluded that McKee’s disparate\ntreatment claim required application of the strict scrutiny standard. (Id. at pp. 1197-\n1198.) “Because neither the People nor the court below properly understood this\nburden,” the McKee I court decided, the People would have an opportunity to make the\nappropriate showing on remand. (Id. at pp. 1207-1208.) “It must be shown that,\nnotwithstanding the similarities between SVP’s and MDO’s, the former as a class bear a\nsubstantially greater risk to society, and that therefore imposing on them a greater burden\nbefore they can be released from commitment is needed to protect society.” (Id. at\np. 1208.) This could be shown in a variety of ways, the court explained, including by\ndemonstrating that the “inherent nature of the SVP’s mental disorder” makes recidivism\nby SVP’s “significantly more likely” or that “SVP’s pose a greater risk to a particularly\nvulnerable class of victims.” (Ibid.) The court directed the People on remand “to justify\nProposition 83’s indefinite commitment provisions . . . and demonstrate that they are\nbased on a reasonable perception of the unique dangers that SVP’s pose rather than a\nspecial stigma that SVP’s may bear in the eyes of California’s electorate.” (Id. at\np. 1210.)\n       On remand, the trial court conducted a 21-day evidentiary hearing. (See McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1330.) Experts testified that SVP’s have a higher risk of\nrecidivism, that victims of sexual offenses suffer “unique and, in general, greater trauma”\nthan victims of nonsex offenses, and that SVP’s “are significantly different from MDO’s\n                                              4\n\fand NGI’s diagnostically and in treatment.” (Id. at pp. 1340-1347.) Concluding that this\njustified the disparate treatment of SVP’s, the trial court rejected McKee’s equal\nprotection claim. (McKee II, at p. 1330.)\n       The Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence de novo. (McKee II, supra, 207\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1340-1347.) The court concluded that “the People on remand met\ntheir burden to present substantial evidence, including medical and scientific evidence,\njustifying the amended Act’s disparate treatment of SVP’s (e.g., by imposing\nindeterminate terms of civil commitment and placing on them the burden to prove they\nshould be released). (McKee [I], supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1207.) The People have shown\nthat, ‘notwithstanding the similarities between SVP’s and MDO’s [and NGI’s], the\nformer as a class bear a substantially greater risk to society, and that therefore imposing\non them a greater burden before they can be released from commitment is needed to\nprotect society.’ (Id. at p. 1208.) The People have shown ‘that the inherent nature of the\nSVP’s mental disorder makes recidivism as a class significantly more likely[;] . . . that\nSVP’s pose a greater risk [and unique dangers] to a particularly vulnerable class of\nvictims, such as children’; and that SVP’s have diagnostic and treatment differences from\nMDO’s and NGI’s, thereby supporting a reasonable perception by the electorate that\npassed Proposition 83 that the disparate treatment of SVP’s under the amended Act is\nnecessary to further the state’s compelling interests in public safety and humanely\ntreating the mentally disordered. [Citation.]” (McKee II, at p. 1347.)\n\n\n                                 C. Welch’s Contentions\n       Welch contends that the McKee II court’s findings and conclusions bind only\nMcKee. He maintains that he has a due process right to present evidence and to argue at\ntrial that a life commitment cannot validly be imposed on him. We disagree.\n       Welch first argues that he and McKee are “dissimilarly situated” because his\nvictims were adult women while McKee’s victims were children. An argument based on\n                                              5\n\fthe same distinction was rejected in People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(McKnight). We agree with the McKnight court that the analysis and holding in McKee II\ndo not turn on concerns specific to child predators. (McKnight, at p. 863; see McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347 [stating multiple bases for the court’s finding that\nSVP’s as a class bear a substantially greater risk to society, which warrants imposing a\ngreater burden on them before they can be released from commitment].)\n       Welch next argues that the California Supreme Court “did not purport to resolve\ndefinitively the constitutionality of the SVP law” but on the contrary “implicitly\ndetermined” in McKee I that an equal protection judgment must be made in each case on\nan as applied rather than a class basis. We disagree.\n       Other courts have rejected this argument, and properly so. (E.g., McKnight, supra,\n212 Cal.App.4th at pp. 863-864; People v. McDonald (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1378 (McDonald).) As the McKnight court explained, the McKee I court “recognized\nthat the People could attempt to justify the Act’s disparate impact in a variety of ways,\nand that these included showing that SVP’s as a class are significantly more likely to\nreoffend than MDO’s or NGI’s, showing they pose a greater risk to children (in which\ncase the equal protection analysis would apply only to child predators), or by other,\nunspecified means. [Citation.] In light of that recognition, the Court transferred the\nmultiple ‘grant and hold’ cases under McKee I, including this one, to the Courts of\nAppeal with directions to vacate their prior opinions and suspend further proceedings\nuntil the McKee I remand proceedings were final, ‘in order to avoid an unnecessary\nmultiplicity of proceedings.’ [Citations.] On remand, McKee [II] concluded that\ndifferences between SVP’s as a class and other offenders justify their different treatment\nunder the Act. It is plain that McKee II is not to be restricted to [McKee] alone or only to\nthose SVP’s convicted of crimes against children . . . , but rather its holding applies to the\nclass of SVP’s as a whole.” (McKnight, at pp. 863-864; accord, McDonald, at p. 1378.)\nWe agree with the McKnight and McDonald courts’ conclusion that the high court’s\n                                              6\n\femphasis on classwide proof, together with its suspension of activity in grant-and-hold\ncases to avoid an unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings, demonstrates that it intended\nthe equal protection challenge to the amended SVPA be resolved on a class basis in\nMcKee II. (McKnight, at pp. 863-864; McDonald, at p. 1378.)\n       Welch next argues that the McKee II court improperly applied a deferential rather\nthan a de novo standard of review, as evidenced by its discussion of the applicable\nstandard, which “referred . . . three times to the ‘substantial evidence’ standard.” We\ndisagree.\n       A court applying the deferential substantial evidence standard of review “ ‘must\nview the evidence in a light most favorable to [the judgment] and presume in support of\nthe judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the\nevidence.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Johnson (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576; see Jackson v.\nVirginia (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318-320.) That is not what the McKee II court did here.\n       Addressing the standard of review, McKee II court stated that “McKee asserts, and\nwe agree, that we review de novo the trial court’s determination whether the Act, as\namended by Proposition 83, violates his equal protection rights. We independently\ndetermine whether the People presented substantial, factual evidence to support a\nreasonable perception that SVP’s pose a unique and/or greater danger to society than do\nMDO’s and NGI’s, thereby justifying the disparate treatment of SVP’s under the Act.”\n(McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1338, italics added.) The court rejected the\nPeople’s argument that it should defer to the trial court’s findings of historical fact and\ncredibility determinations. (Id. at p. 1338, fn. 3.) Observing that “the trial court’s\nstatement of decision did not make any express findings regarding disputed historical\nfacts or the credibility of certain witnesses,” the court declared that it was “in as good a\nposition as the trial court to decide whether the evidence presented by the People during\nthe remand hearing satisfied their burden to justify the disparate treatment of SVP’s\nunder the Act.” (Ibid., italics added.) The court ultimately agreed with the trial court that\n                                              7\n\fthe People had produced substantial evidence to justify the disparate treatment. (Id. at\npp. 1330-1331.) The McKee II court’s review was plainly de novo.\n       The McKee II court’s statement that “[i]n independently reviewing the evidence\nadmitted at the remand hearing, we must determine whether the People presented\nsubstantial evidence to support a reasonable inference or perception that the Act’s\ndisparate treatment of SVP’s is necessary to further compelling state interests” does not\ncompel a contrary conclusion. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1339.) The\nquoted statement’s reference to “substantial evidence” reflects nothing more than the\nMcKee II court’s adherence to the standard the high court directed it to follow. In McKee\nI, the high court explained that “[w]hen a constitutional right, such as the right to liberty\nfrom involuntary confinement, is at stake, the usual judicial deference to legislative\nfindings gives way to an exercise of independent judgment of the facts to ascertain\nwhether the legislative body ‘ “has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial\nevidence.” ’ [Citations.]” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1206-1207.)

In Moye, which involved an equal protection challenge to a\ncivil commitment statute, the high court articulated the strict scrutiny standard as follows:\n“[T]he state must establish both that it has a ‘compelling interest’ which justifies the\nchallenged procedure and that the distinctions drawn by the procedure are necessary to\nfurther that interest.” (Moye, at p. 465.)\n                                              8\n\f       The McKee II court applied that standard. It independently reviewed the evidence\nand concluded that the People had shown that the legislative distinctions between classes\nof persons subject to civil commitment were reasonable and factually based. (McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347.) Specifically, the People had shown that recidivism\namong SVP’s as a class is more likely than among either MDO’s or NGI’s, that SVP’s\npose a greater risk to a particularly vulnerable class of victims, and that they have\n“significantly different diagnoses” and significantly different treatment plans,\ncompliance, and success rates than MDO’s and NGI’s have. (McKee II, at p. 1347.) The\ncourt concluded that these distinctions justified disparate treatment, which was\n“necessary to further the state’s compelling interests in public safety and humanely\ntreating the mentally disordered.” (Ibid.) This satisfied the strict scrutiny standard.\n       Welch argues, however, that “[t]he portion of the opinion addressing the [trial\ncourt’s] three factual findings does not use language indicating [that] ‘the state has a\ncompelling interest in treating the three classes differently.’ ” The argument lacks merit.\nThe McKee II court expressly stated that the significant differences between the three\nclasses “support[ed] a reasonable perception by the electorate . . . that the disparate\ntreatment of SVP’s under the amended Act is necessary to further the state’s compelling\ninterests in public safety and humanely treating the mentally disordered.” (McKee II,\nsupra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347, italics added.)\n       Welch also argues that strict scrutiny “requires an analysis of whether the different\ntreatment of the classes is actually necessary.” We disagree.\n       The People were not required to show that SVP’s are actually more dangerous as a\nclass. In remanding the case, the McKee I court stated that “the government will have an\nopportunity to justify Proposition 83’s indefinite commitment provisions . . . , and\ndemonstrate that they are based on a reasonable perception of the unique dangers that\nSVP’s pose rather than a special stigma that SVP’s may bear in the eyes of California’s\nelectorate. [¶] Moreover, we emphasize that mere disagreement among experts will not\n                                              9\n\fsuffice to overturn the Proposition 83 amendments. The trial court must determine\nwhether the legislative distinctions in classes of persons subject to civil commitment are\nreasonable and factually based—not whether they are incontrovertible or\nuncontroversial.” (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 1210-1211, fn. omitted, italics\nadded.) The McKee II court relied on evidence that scores on the Static-99 test, which\nassesses the risk that a sex offender will commit sex offenses, were significantly higher\nfor SVP’s than for MDO’s and NGI’s. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1340-\n1342.) It complied with the high court’s directions.\n       Welch next complains that the evidentiary hearing in McKee II improperly\nfocused on evidence that was “irrelevant to a correct strict scrutiny analysis”—i.e., on\nevidence that lawmakers might have considered before enacting Proposition 83 and the\namended SVPA. “The only evidence any court should have been reviewing,” Welch\nasserts, “was that showing the actual intent of the voters who passed Proposition 83 and\nthe [L]egislature that passed S.B. 1128.” We disagree.\n       Welch’s reliance on Mississippi University for Women v.

(MUW, at pp. 728-730 [holding that university’s female-only admissions policy,\nas applied to males seeking admission to the university’s school of nursing, violated\nequal protection where, “although the State recited a ‘benign, compensatory purpose,’ it\nfailed to establish that the alleged objective [wa]s the actual purpose underlying the\ndiscriminatory classification,” italics added]; Virginia, at pp. 534-536 [noting that “[i]n\ncases of this genre, our precedent instructs that ‘benign’ justifications proffered in\ndefense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable\njustification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact\ndifferently grounded,” and holding that the state had shown “no ‘exceedingly persuasive\n                                             10\n\fjustification’ for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI.”\n(Italics added)].) MUW and Virginia are inapposite because the government action\nchallenged in McKee II (and here) is not based on gender or any other suspect\nclassification.3\n        Welch next contends that the McKee II court “should have required that the\nSVPA amendments be narrowly tailored to serve their purported purpose.” Asserting\nthat “authority for that proposition is abundant,” he criticizes the McKee II court for\nstating “that McKee failed to cite any authority requiring that such a law be narrowly\ntailored.”\n       McKee cited Bernal v.

In Bernal, the United States Supreme\nCourt stated that “[i]n order to withstand strict scrutiny, the law must advance a\ncompelling state interest by the least restrictive means available.” (Bernal, at p. 219.)\nThe McKee II court described the quoted sentence from Bernal as “probable dictum,”\ndistinguishing Bernal because it involved a suspect class, alienage. (McKee II, at\np. 1349.) “We are unaware of any case applying the ‘least restrictive means available’\nrequirement to all cases involving disparate treatment of similarly situated classes,” the\nMcKee II court wrote. (Ibid.) “On the contrary, our review of equal protection case law\nshows the two-part test, as discussed in Moye and McKee [I], is the prevailing\n\n\n3\n       Shaw v.

Therefore, in strict scrutiny cases, the government must show both a\ncompelling state interest justifying the disparate treatment and that the disparate\ntreatment is necessary to further that compelling state interest. [Citations.] We are\nunpersuaded the electorate that passed Proposition 83 in 2006 was required to adopt the\nleast restrictive means available (e.g., a two-year or other determinate term of civil\ncommitment) in disparately treating SVP’s and furthering the compelling state interests\nof public safety and humane treatment of the mentally disordered.” (McKee II, at\np. 1349.)\n       We agree with the McKee II court’s analysis of this issue. We note that Moye, like\nMcKee II and like this case, involved an equal protection challenge to a civil commitment\nstatute. The high court in McKee I specifically instructed the trial court, on remand, to\n“determine whether the People, applying the equal protection principles articulated in\nMoye and related cases discussed in the [McKee I court’s] opinion,” could demonstrate\nthat imposing a greater burden on SVP’s than on MDO’s or NGI’s to obtain release from\nconfinement was necessary to promote the state’s compelling interest in public safety and\nhumane treatment of the mentally ill.

(Skinner, at p. 541.)\n“When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same\nquality of offense [e.g. grand larceny and embezzlement] and sterilizes one and not the\nother, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or\nnationality for oppressive treatment.” (Ibid.)

(Brandon, at p. 949.) Noting\nthat the issue involved the inmate’s First Amendment interest in avoiding forced\nmedication that could interfere with his ability to communicate ideas, his Fifth\nAmendment liberty interest in being free from bodily intrusion, and his Sixth\nAmendment right to a fair trial, the court concluded that due process considerations\nrequired a judicial hearing and that the district court should apply the strict scrutiny\nstandard on remand. (Brandon, at pp. 953-955, 957.) In Sanchez v.

(Sanchez, at p. 680.) None of these\ndecisions involved an equal protection challenge to a civil commitment statute. Moye\ndid, and the California Supreme Court specifically instructed that it be followed on\nremand in McKee. (McKee I, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 1208.) The McKee II court did not\nerr in following the high court’s directive to apply the equal protection principles\narticulated in Moye.\n       Welch next contends that the McKee II court’s failure to distinguish In re Calhoun\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259438/in-re-calhoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The two groups were similarly situated\n“for purposes of the law concerning the right to refuse antipsychotic medication,” the\ncourt explained, and the People had failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest that\njustified a distinction between them in that regard. (Id. at pp. 1352-1354.)\n       Calhoun is easily distinguished. The equal protection issue in Calhoun turned on\nthe absence of differences between SVP’s and MDO’s with respect to the need for, and\n                                              13\n\fthe effectiveness of, antipsychotic medication. (McKee II, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1352.) The equal protection issue in McKee II, by contrast, turned on the differences\nbetween the two groups with respect to recidivism rates, dangerousness, and diagnoses\nand treatment. (Id. at pp. 1340-1347.) That the Calhoun court found no justification for\ntreating SVP’s and MDO’s differently with respect to forced medication does not mean\nthere can be no justification for treating them differently with respect to their release into\nsociety.
