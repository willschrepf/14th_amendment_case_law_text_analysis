The plaintiffs in this case are\r                          _____________\r<br>\r<br>            former residents of Boston's Old  West End who were forced to\r<br>\r<br>            relocate when their  homes were taken  by eminent domain  for\r<br>\r<br>            urban  renewal.  They  claim that Massachusetts  law entitles\r<br>\r<br>            them  to first preference for tenancy  of all new residential\r<br>\r<br>            units built on the land, and that they are  being denied this\r<br>\r<br>            preference in a new development called West End Place because\r<br>\r<br>            most  former  West  Enders are  white.    The  district judge\r<br>\r<br>            dismissed the complaint, leading to this appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                 The background facts  are undisputed.  In May  1956, the\r<br>\r<br>            Boston  Housing  Authority,  the  forerunner  to  the current\r<br>\r<br>            Boston  Redevelopment Authority (\"the BRA\"),1 prepared a plan\r<br>\r<br>            for  urban  renewal of  Boston's  Old  West End,  a  downtown\r<br>\r<br>            neighborhood lying just  north of Beacon Hill.   The plan was\r<br>\r<br>            approved  as required under  Massachusetts law, and  in 1958,\r<br>\r<br>            the BRA ordered  a taking by eminent domain of  a large area,\r<br>\r<br>            displacing  over   three  thousand   households  of   diverse\r<br>\r<br>            heritages, but including few African Americans.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  BRA executed  a  lease  agreement  with  a  private\r<br>\r<br>            developer,  Charles River Park, Inc. (\"Charles River\").  Over\r<br>\r<br>            the next ten years, Charles  River razed buildings in the Old\r<br>\r<br>            West  End   and  built  offices,  condominiums,   and  luxury\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1The  BRA is  an entity  established  by the  Commonwealth of\r<br>            Massachusetts  to  undertake  urban renewal  projects  and to\r<br>            relieve  housing  shortages.   See  Collins  v.  Selectmen of\r                                           ___  _______      ____________\r<br>            Brookline, 325 Mass. 562, 564-66 (1950).\r            _________\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            residential   units.     The   new   buildings  were   either\r<br>\r<br>            nonresidential or  so expensive that  very few of  the former\r<br>\r<br>            West Enders could afford to occupy them.\r<br>\r<br>                 In 1970, the BRA terminated Charles River as the project\r<br>\r<br>            developer   and,  in   1986,  solicited  proposals   for  the\r<br>\r<br>            development  of Lowell Square, located at the intersection of\r<br>\r<br>            Lomasney Way and  Staniford Street, the only  remaining large\r<br>\r<br>            undeveloped  section of  the Old  West End.   A  proposal was\r<br>\r<br>            submitted   by   the   Lowell   Square  Cooperative   Limited\r<br>\r<br>            Partnership (the  \"developer\")  to build  a  new  development\r<br>\r<br>            called West End Place at Lowell Square.2  \r<br>\r<br>                 The   BRA   eventually   awarded   the   developer   the\r<br>\r<br>            redevelopment  contract.   One restriction  in  the agreement\r<br>\r<br>            between  the BRA  and  the developer  mirrors a  provision of\r<br>\r<br>            Massachusetts law requiring the BRA to obligate the developer\r<br>\r<br>            as follows:\r<br>\r<br>                 (c)  to give preference in the selection of tenants\r<br>                 for dwelling  units built  in the  project area  to\r<br>                 families displaced  therefrom because  of clearance\r<br>                 and renewal  activity who  desire to  live in  such\r<br>                 dwelling units and who will be able to pay rents or\r<br>                 prices  equal  to  rents  or prices  charged  other\r<br>                 families for  similar or comparable  dwelling units\r<br>                 built as a part of the same redevelopment; and \r<br>\r<br>                 (d) to  comply with  such other  conditions as  are\r<br>                 deemed  necessary to carry out the purposes of this\r<br>                 chapter, or requirements of  federal legislation or\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            2The  partnership later  underwent  a  name  change  and,  in\r<br>            addition,  the  complaint  names other  private  entities and\r<br>            individuals associated  with it.   For  convenience, all  are\r<br>            referred to as \"the developer.\"\r<br>\r<br>                                         -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                 regulations   under   which    loans,   grants   or\r<br>                 contributions have been  made or agreed to  be made\r<br>                 to meet a part of the cost of the project.\r<br>\r<br>            Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121B,   49 (1986).\r<br>\r<br>                 The  BRA also required  that the developer  work closely\r<br>\r<br>            with former West Enders in  developing the property.  To that\r<br>\r<br>            end,  a number of former West  Enders formed the Old West End\r<br>\r<br>            Housing Corporation.  This nonprofit entity and the developer\r<br>\r<br>            signed a  participation agreement, which stated,  inter alia,\r                                                              __________\r<br>\r<br>            that former West  Enders would have  first preference in  the\r<br>\r<br>            purchase  or rental of  residential units in  West End Place,\r<br>\r<br>            subject to applicable local, state, and federal laws.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  developer sought out numerous sources of financing,\r<br>\r<br>            including government funding from  local, state, and  federal\r<br>\r<br>            agencies.  In  particular, the federal Department  of Housing\r<br>\r<br>            and Urban Development  (\"HUD\") funded a grant of $2.5 million\r<br>\r<br>            for  construction, and it  also committed $7  million in rent\r<br>\r<br>            subsidies for the low-income units in West End Place.  See 42\r                                                                   ___\r<br>\r<br>            U.S.C.   1437f (1994).  Like most federal housing assistance,\r<br>\r<br>            these funds were  contingent on compliance with  federal fair\r<br>\r<br>            housing requirements.  See 24 C.F.R.    1.5, 5.105 (1997).\r                                   ___\r<br>\r<br>                 One  such requirement  is that  developer recipients  of\r<br>\r<br>            federal housing funds  must carry out an  affirmative program\r<br>\r<br>            to attract  minority, as  well as  majority, applicants;  the\r<br>\r<br>            pertinent  regulation   contemplates  mailings   to  minority\r<br>\r<br>            organizations,  assurances  of  nondiscrimination,  and  like\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            measures.

The developer and the agencies  agreed; the Old\r<br>\r<br>            West  End Housing  Corporation did  not.   Nevertheless,  the\r<br>\r<br>            mediator's   solution  was   included   in  the   developer's\r<br>\r<br>            affirmative fair  housing marketing plan, which  HUD approved\r<br>\r<br>            in 1996.\r<br>\r<br>                 The plan operates as follows.   West End Place  contains\r<br>\r<br>            183  residential  units  that  fall  into   three  rent-based\r<br>\r<br>            categories: 58 \"low-income\" units (subsidized by HUD  funds),\r<br>\r<br>            48  \"moderate-income units,\"  and 77  units  to be  rented at\r<br>\r<br>            market  rates.   Under the  plan,  the developer  is to  give\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders  first preference as to 101  of 183 units,\r<br>\r<br>            that  is,  55 percent  of  the total.   These  101  units are\r<br>\r<br>            unevenly distributed over  the three rent categories:  former\r<br>\r<br>            West Enders have  a preference as to 19  low-income units (33\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            percent),  24  moderate-income  units (50  percent),  and  58\r<br>\r<br>            market-rate units (75 percent).\r<br>\r<br>                 The tenant selection works by lottery.  Each preliminary\r<br>\r<br>            application  is assigned a  random number.   The applications\r<br>\r<br>            are   then  separated  into   two  pools:  pool   A  contains\r<br>\r<br>            applications from  displaced former  West Enders  and pool  B\r<br>\r<br>            contains  all other  applicants.   Then,  for the  low-income\r<br>\r<br>            units,  the top-ranked  applicant from  pool  A is  selected,\r<br>\r<br>            followed by the two  top-ranked applicants from pool  B; this\r<br>\r<br>            yields a  total of 33  percent pool A applicants  (33 percent\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders) in the  low-income units.  The process is\r<br>\r<br>            then repeated until all 58 units are tentatively allocated.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  same lottery  approach is  used for  the other  two\r<br>\r<br>            categories  of apartments.   For  moderate-income units,  the\r<br>\r<br>            draw ratio is one-to-one (50 percent former West Enders); for\r<br>\r<br>            the market-rate units,  three-to-one (75 percent former  West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders).  Applicants who  have been selected in this  process\r<br>\r<br>            are then invited to complete a full application and undergo a\r<br>\r<br>            more   thorough   screening   process,  which   can   include\r<br>\r<br>            verifications of personal references and credit history.  The\r<br>\r<br>            same process can supply additional applicants if needed.\r<br>\r<br>                 From  August 26  to September  26, 1996,  a real  estate\r<br>\r<br>            manager hired by the developer coordinated community outreach\r<br>\r<br>            efforts  to stimulate preliminary  applications.  The manager\r<br>\r<br>            also contacted former West Enders as well as the Old West End\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            Housing Corporation.   The manager eventually  received 1,858\r<br>\r<br>            timely preliminary applications, 308 of  which identified the\r<br>\r<br>            applicants as  former West  Enders.  Of  the 308  former West\r<br>\r<br>            Ender applicants, 12  identified themselves as black,  one as\r<br>\r<br>            Latino, and 19 did not identify their race.  \r<br>\r<br>                 On September 26,  1996, the individual  plaintiffs--four\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders--filed  a complaint in the  district court\r<br>\r<br>            challenging  the tenant  selection process  and  the plan  on\r<br>\r<br>            numerous  grounds;  they purported  to represent  former West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders as a  class.  The Old West End Housing Corporation was\r<br>\r<br>            also named  as a plaintiff.   The numerous  defendants divide\r<br>\r<br>            into four categories:  the BRA and its director;  HUD and its\r<br>\r<br>            Secretary; the City  of Boston and various  of its officials;\r<br>\r<br>            and,  finally,  the  developer   and  other  private  parties\r<br>\r<br>            associated with the development of West End Place. \r<br>\r<br>                 On October 21,  1996, the plaintiffs filed  an emergency\r<br>\r<br>            motion  for a  preliminary injunction  to  halt the  lottery,\r<br>\r<br>            which was later withdrawn  when the defendants agreed  to let\r<br>\r<br>            the  former West Enders' representatives monitor the lottery.\r<br>\r<br>            In the lottery, which took place on October 29, 1996,  two of\r<br>\r<br>            the  named plaintiffs received  rankings in the  lottery that\r<br>\r<br>            make it  unlikely that  they will receive  units in  West End\r<br>\r<br>            Place.\r<br>\r<br>                 The developer  and  various other  defendants  moved  to\r<br>\r<br>            dismiss the  complaint,  Fed.

Specifically, the  complaint\r<br>\r<br>            cites the  defendants' reliance  upon the  consent decree  as\r<br>\r<br>            comprising a racial  purpose and goal and asserts  that, as a\r<br>\r<br>            result,  the former West Enders were deprived of a benefit--a\r<br>\r<br>            statutory preference for all of the apartments--based upon \"a\r<br>\r<br>            racial classification.\"   In their appeal  brief, plaintiffs'\r<br>\r<br>            shorthand  version  is  that  the  preference  was  curtailed\r<br>\r<br>            \"because\" the former West Enders were predominantly white.\r<br>\r<br>                 Factual assertions in a  complaint are normally accepted\r<br>\r<br>            as  true for  purposes of  a  motion to  dismiss, see,  e.g.,\r                                                              __________\r<br>\r<br>            Berner  v.

The\r<br>\r<br>            defendants'  position, adopted by the district court, is that\r<br>\r<br>            such federal requirements--as a matter of Massachusetts law--\r<br>\r<br>            qualify   the  statutory  priority.     Plaintiffs  have  not\r<br>\r<br>            challenged this ruling on appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                 The plaintiffs  might have  argued  that the  limitation\r<br>\r<br>            adopted  here is  not  itself  a  \"requirement\"  of  \"federal\r<br>\r<br>            legislation  or  regulations\"  but   is  merely  a  developer\r<br>\r<br>            proposal that HUD  has chosen to bless.  Possibly, plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>            thought that this arguable distinction did not matter because\r<br>\r<br>            a  federal administrative  measure, even  if  not statute  or\r<br>\r<br>            regulation,  might  override  state   legislation  under  the\r<br>\r<br>            Supremacy Clause--assuming always  that it was  an authorized\r<br>\r<br>            measure.  This  is by no  means clear, but arguments  on this\r<br>\r<br>            point have not been made and need not be pursued. \r<br>\r<br>                 In the district court, it appears that plaintiffs' trust\r<br>\r<br>            argument may have been advanced  primarily as an adjunct to a\r<br>\r<br>            different  constitutional claim, namely a claim that the plan\r<br>\r<br>            in  question impaired a property interest without due process\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            or  just compensation.   The alleged trust,  in this context,\r<br>\r<br>            would be a way of expressing a claimed property interest.  It\r<br>\r<br>            is not obvious why a trust interest would be more entitled to\r<br>\r<br>            this status than section 49's simple expression of a priority\r<br>\r<br>            in favor of former tenants.\r<br>\r<br>                 In all events, whether called a trust or something else,\r<br>\r<br>            any  property interest created  by section 49(c)  is arguably\r<br>\r<br>            subject to section  49's own explicit reservation  in section\r<br>\r<br>            49(d).

The  complaint\r<br>\r<br>            does not  allege that  the preference  was curtailed  because\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs  are  racially  monolithic;  it alleges  that  the\r<br>\r<br>            preference was curtailed because of the consent decree.  And,\r<br>\r<br>            as I have stated, because the consent decree operates only in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            favor of racial  and ethnic minorities, it could  not be read\r<br>\r<br>            to require curtailment  of the preference if  the former West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders  were  predominantly  black.   Thus,  for  purposes of\r<br>\r<br>            evaluating  defendants' Rule  12(b)(6)  motion, I  believe we\r<br>\r<br>            must  read into  the complaint  the  allegation the  majority\r<br>\r<br>            believes  necessary to trigger  strict scrutiny, see  ante at\r                                                             ___  ____\r<br>\r<br>            16:  that defendants would not have acted as they did had the\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiff class  been predominantly of color.

Thus, in\r<br>\r<br>            evaluating the constitutionality  of defendants' conduct,  we\r<br>\r<br>            must not  look to its  effect and motivation with  respect to\r<br>\r<br>            others;  we  must  look at  its  effect  and  motivation with\r<br>\r<br>            respect  to plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs in this case are\r                          _____________\r<br>\r<br>            former residents of Boston's Old  West End who were forced to\r<br>\r<br>            relocate when their  homes were taken  by eminent domain  for\r<br>\r<br>            urban  renewal.  They  claim that Massachusetts  law entitles\r<br>\r<br>            them  to first preference for tenancy  of all new residential\r<br>\r<br>            units built on the land, and that they are  being denied this\r<br>\r<br>            preference in a new development called West End Place because\r<br>\r<br>            most  former  West  Enders are  white.    The  district judge\r<br>\r<br>            dismissed the complaint, leading to this appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                 The background facts  are undisputed.  In May  1956, the\r<br>\r<br>            Boston  Housing  Authority,  the  forerunner  to  the current\r<br>\r<br>            Boston  Redevelopment Authority (\"the BRA\"),1 prepared a plan\r<br>\r<br>            for  urban  renewal of  Boston's  Old  West End,  a  downtown\r<br>\r<br>            neighborhood lying just  north of Beacon Hill.   The plan was\r<br>\r<br>            approved  as required under  Massachusetts law, and  in 1958,\r<br>\r<br>            the BRA ordered  a taking by eminent domain of  a large area,\r<br>\r<br>            displacing  over   three  thousand   households  of   diverse\r<br>\r<br>            heritages, but including few African Americans.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  BRA executed  a  lease  agreement  with  a  private\r<br>\r<br>            developer,  Charles River Park, Inc. (\"Charles River\").  Over\r<br>\r<br>            the next ten years, Charles  River razed buildings in the Old\r<br>\r<br>            West  End   and  built  offices,  condominiums,   and  luxury\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1The  BRA is  an entity  established  by the  Commonwealth of\r<br>            Massachusetts  to  undertake  urban renewal  projects  and to\r<br>            relieve  housing  shortages.

The   new   buildings  were   either\r<br>\r<br>            nonresidential or  so expensive that  very few of  the former\r<br>\r<br>            West Enders could afford to occupy them.\r<br>\r<br>                 In 1970, the BRA terminated Charles River as the project\r<br>\r<br>            developer   and,  in   1986,  solicited  proposals   for  the\r<br>\r<br>            development  of Lowell Square, located at the intersection of\r<br>\r<br>            Lomasney Way and  Staniford Street, the only  remaining large\r<br>\r<br>            undeveloped  section of  the Old  West End.   A  proposal was\r<br>\r<br>            submitted   by   the   Lowell   Square  Cooperative   Limited\r<br>\r<br>            Partnership (the  \"developer\")  to build  a  new  development\r<br>\r<br>            called West End Place at Lowell Square.2  \r<br>\r<br>                 The   BRA   eventually   awarded   the   developer   the\r<br>\r<br>            redevelopment  contract.   One restriction  in  the agreement\r<br>\r<br>            between  the BRA  and  the developer  mirrors a  provision of\r<br>\r<br>            Massachusetts law requiring the BRA to obligate the developer\r<br>\r<br>            as follows:\r<br>\r<br>                 (c)  to give preference in the selection of tenants\r<br>                 for dwelling  units built  in the  project area  to\r<br>                 families displaced  therefrom because  of clearance\r<br>                 and renewal  activity who  desire to  live in  such\r<br>                 dwelling units and who will be able to pay rents or\r<br>                 prices  equal  to  rents  or prices  charged  other\r<br>                 families for  similar or comparable  dwelling units\r<br>                 built as a part of the same redevelopment; and \r<br>\r<br>                 (d) to  comply with  such other  conditions as  are\r<br>                 deemed  necessary to carry out the purposes of this\r<br>                 chapter, or requirements of  federal legislation or\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            2The  partnership later  underwent  a  name  change  and,  in\r<br>            addition,  the  complaint  names other  private  entities and\r<br>            individuals associated  with it.

Gen. Laws ch. 121B,   49 (1986).\r<br>\r<br>                 The  BRA also required  that the developer  work closely\r<br>\r<br>            with former West Enders in  developing the property.  To that\r<br>\r<br>            end,  a number of former West  Enders formed the Old West End\r<br>\r<br>            Housing Corporation.  This nonprofit entity and the developer\r<br>\r<br>            signed a  participation agreement, which stated,  inter alia,\r                                                              __________\r<br>\r<br>            that former West  Enders would have  first preference in  the\r<br>\r<br>            purchase  or rental of  residential units in  West End Place,\r<br>\r<br>            subject to applicable local, state, and federal laws.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  developer sought out numerous sources of financing,\r<br>\r<br>            including government funding from  local, state, and  federal\r<br>\r<br>            agencies.  In  particular, the federal Department  of Housing\r<br>\r<br>            and Urban Development  (\"HUD\") funded a grant of $2.5 million\r<br>\r<br>            for  construction, and it  also committed $7  million in rent\r<br>\r<br>            subsidies for the low-income units in West End Place.

The developer and the agencies  agreed; the Old\r<br>\r<br>            West  End Housing  Corporation did  not.   Nevertheless,  the\r<br>\r<br>            mediator's   solution  was   included   in  the   developer's\r<br>\r<br>            affirmative fair  housing marketing plan, which  HUD approved\r<br>\r<br>            in 1996.\r<br>\r<br>                 The plan operates as follows.   West End Place  contains\r<br>\r<br>            183  residential  units  that  fall  into   three  rent-based\r<br>\r<br>            categories: 58 \"low-income\" units (subsidized by HUD  funds),\r<br>\r<br>            48  \"moderate-income units,\"  and 77  units  to be  rented at\r<br>\r<br>            market  rates.   Under the  plan,  the developer  is to  give\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders  first preference as to 101  of 183 units,\r<br>\r<br>            that  is,  55 percent  of  the total.   These  101  units are\r<br>\r<br>            unevenly distributed over  the three rent categories:  former\r<br>\r<br>            West Enders have  a preference as to 19  low-income units (33\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            percent),  24  moderate-income  units (50  percent),  and  58\r<br>\r<br>            market-rate units (75 percent).\r<br>\r<br>                 The tenant selection works by lottery.  Each preliminary\r<br>\r<br>            application  is assigned a  random number.   The applications\r<br>\r<br>            are   then  separated  into   two  pools:  pool   A  contains\r<br>\r<br>            applications from  displaced former  West Enders  and pool  B\r<br>\r<br>            contains  all other  applicants.   Then,  for the  low-income\r<br>\r<br>            units,  the top-ranked  applicant from  pool  A is  selected,\r<br>\r<br>            followed by the two  top-ranked applicants from pool  B; this\r<br>\r<br>            yields a  total of 33  percent pool A applicants  (33 percent\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders) in the  low-income units.  The process is\r<br>\r<br>            then repeated until all 58 units are tentatively allocated.\r<br>\r<br>                 The  same lottery  approach is  used for  the other  two\r<br>\r<br>            categories  of apartments.   For  moderate-income units,  the\r<br>\r<br>            draw ratio is one-to-one (50 percent former West Enders); for\r<br>\r<br>            the market-rate units,  three-to-one (75 percent former  West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders).  Applicants who  have been selected in this  process\r<br>\r<br>            are then invited to complete a full application and undergo a\r<br>\r<br>            more   thorough   screening   process,  which   can   include\r<br>\r<br>            verifications of personal references and credit history.  The\r<br>\r<br>            same process can supply additional applicants if needed.\r<br>\r<br>                 From  August 26  to September  26, 1996,  a real  estate\r<br>\r<br>            manager hired by the developer coordinated community outreach\r<br>\r<br>            efforts  to stimulate preliminary  applications.  The manager\r<br>\r<br>            also contacted former West Enders as well as the Old West End\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            Housing Corporation.   The manager eventually  received 1,858\r<br>\r<br>            timely preliminary applications, 308 of  which identified the\r<br>\r<br>            applicants as  former West  Enders.  Of  the 308  former West\r<br>\r<br>            Ender applicants, 12  identified themselves as black,  one as\r<br>\r<br>            Latino, and 19 did not identify their race.  \r<br>\r<br>                 On September 26,  1996, the individual  plaintiffs--four\r<br>\r<br>            former West Enders--filed  a complaint in the  district court\r<br>\r<br>            challenging  the tenant  selection process  and  the plan  on\r<br>\r<br>            numerous  grounds;  they purported  to represent  former West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders as a  class.  The Old West End Housing Corporation was\r<br>\r<br>            also named  as a plaintiff.   The numerous  defendants divide\r<br>\r<br>            into four categories:  the BRA and its director;  HUD and its\r<br>\r<br>            Secretary; the City  of Boston and various  of its officials;\r<br>\r<br>            and,  finally,  the  developer   and  other  private  parties\r<br>\r<br>            associated with the development of West End Place. \r<br>\r<br>                 On October 21,  1996, the plaintiffs filed  an emergency\r<br>\r<br>            motion  for a  preliminary injunction  to  halt the  lottery,\r<br>\r<br>            which was later withdrawn  when the defendants agreed  to let\r<br>\r<br>            the  former West Enders' representatives monitor the lottery.\r<br>\r<br>            In the lottery, which took place on October 29, 1996,  two of\r<br>\r<br>            the  named plaintiffs received  rankings in the  lottery that\r<br>\r<br>            make it  unlikely that  they will receive  units in  West End\r<br>\r<br>            Place.\r<br>\r<br>                 The developer  and  various other  defendants  moved  to\r<br>\r<br>            dismiss the  complaint,  Fed.

If\r<br>\r<br>            we assume arguendo  that the former West Enders  are entitled\r                      ________\r<br>\r<br>            to,  and can  enforce, whatever  priority  is provided  under\r<br>\r<br>            section  49, subject always  to superseding federal  law, the\r<br>\r<br>            trust concept  is nothing  more than  a possible  alternative\r<br>\r<br>            remedy for enforcing  any unpreempted rights that  section 49\r<br>\r<br>            may provide.   The question to  be answered, before  remedies\r<br>\r<br>            are even pertinent, is the extent of those rights.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                 By  its terms  section  49(c)  creates  a  priority  for\r<br>\r<br>            displaced  former  residents,  and  subsection  (d)  arguably\r<br>\r<br>            qualifies this priority  by also obligating the  developer to\r<br>\r<br>            comply   with  \"requirements   of   federal  legislation   or\r<br>\r<br>            regulations  under which loans, grants, or contributions have\r<br>\r<br>            been made or agreed to be made to meet a part of  the cost of\r<br>\r<br>            the project.\"   Mass.  Gen.  Laws ch.  121B,    49(d).    The\r<br>\r<br>            defendants'  position, adopted by the district court, is that\r<br>\r<br>            such federal requirements--as a matter of Massachusetts law--\r<br>\r<br>            qualify   the  statutory  priority.     Plaintiffs  have  not\r<br>\r<br>            challenged this ruling on appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                 The plaintiffs  might have  argued  that the  limitation\r<br>\r<br>            adopted  here is  not  itself  a  \"requirement\"  of  \"federal\r<br>\r<br>            legislation  or  regulations\"  but   is  merely  a  developer\r<br>\r<br>            proposal that HUD  has chosen to bless.  Possibly, plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>            thought that this arguable distinction did not matter because\r<br>\r<br>            a  federal administrative  measure, even  if  not statute  or\r<br>\r<br>            regulation,  might  override  state   legislation  under  the\r<br>\r<br>            Supremacy Clause--assuming always  that it was  an authorized\r<br>\r<br>            measure.  This  is by no  means clear, but arguments  on this\r<br>\r<br>            point have not been made and need not be pursued. \r<br>\r<br>                 In the district court, it appears that plaintiffs' trust\r<br>\r<br>            argument may have been advanced  primarily as an adjunct to a\r<br>\r<br>            different  constitutional claim, namely a claim that the plan\r<br>\r<br>            in  question impaired a property interest without due process\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            or  just compensation.   The alleged trust,  in this context,\r<br>\r<br>            would be a way of expressing a claimed property interest.  It\r<br>\r<br>            is not obvious why a trust interest would be more entitled to\r<br>\r<br>            this status than section 49's simple expression of a priority\r<br>\r<br>            in favor of former tenants.\r<br>\r<br>                 In all events, whether called a trust or something else,\r<br>\r<br>            any  property interest created  by section 49(c)  is arguably\r<br>\r<br>            subject to section  49's own explicit reservation  in section\r<br>\r<br>            49(d).  As already noted,  the plaintiffs on this appeal have\r<br>\r<br>            not  challenged the district court ruling that subsection (d)\r<br>\r<br>            qualifies subsection (c) and also embraces the disputed plan.\r<br>\r<br>            Taking  these  district court  rulings  as unchallenged,  the\r<br>\r<br>            trust  argument adds  nothing to  the  due process  argument,\r<br>\r<br>            which  itself has not itself been  renewed in the plaintiffs'\r<br>\r<br>            briefs in this court.\r<br>\r<br>                 This  is a case  that stirs conflicting  sympathies, for\r<br>\r<br>            those  ousted  from  their West  End  neighborhood  by \"urban\r<br>\r<br>            renewal\" many years ago  no less than for  minorities wrongly\r<br>\r<br>            denied fair  housing opportunities  in Boston.   But we  have\r<br>\r<br>            properly  sought to  decide this  appeal  based upon  Supreme\r<br>\r<br>            Court precedent, as best we can discern it, recognizing  that\r<br>\r<br>            the  case  is a  difficult  and unusual  one on  the  edge of\r<br>\r<br>            developing law.

The  complaint\r<br>\r<br>            does not  allege that  the preference  was curtailed  because\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs  are  racially  monolithic;  it alleges  that  the\r<br>\r<br>            preference was curtailed because of the consent decree.  And,\r<br>\r<br>            as I have stated, because the consent decree operates only in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            favor of racial  and ethnic minorities, it could  not be read\r<br>\r<br>            to require curtailment  of the preference if  the former West\r<br>\r<br>            Enders  were  predominantly  black.   Thus,  for  purposes of\r<br>\r<br>            evaluating  defendants' Rule  12(b)(6)  motion, I  believe we\r<br>\r<br>            must  read into  the complaint  the  allegation the  majority\r<br>\r<br>            believes  necessary to trigger  strict scrutiny, see  ante at\r                                                             ___  ____\r<br>\r<br>            16:  that defendants would not have acted as they did had the\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiff class  been predominantly of color.

It  remains to  be  seen\r<br>\r<br>            whether  the Court  will  press this  principle to  its outer\r<br>\r<br>            limit  and  strictly  scrutinize  even  governmental  conduct\r<br>\r<br>            which, though  predominantly motivated  by a  racial purpose,\r<br>\r<br>            would not appear  to burden any person because of  his or her\r<br>\r<br>            race--e.g., a public university's efforts at recruiting fully\r                  ____\r<br>\r<br>            qualified applicants of  color for its first year  law school\r<br>\r<br>            class.    But it  seems  apparent  that defendants'  lack  of\r<br>\r<br>            hostility towards whites in particular, cf. ante at 13,  does\r                                                    ___ ____\r<br>\r<br>            not  shield  their  conduct--which  has  burdened  plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>            because they are, as a group, racially identifiable--from the\r<br>\r<br>            most searching  judicial inquiry.   See  Miller, 515 U.S.  at\r                                                ___  ______\r<br>\r<br>            913.                          This leads to a final point.  I\r<br>\r<br>            think the majority runs afoul of Adarand in concentrating its\r                                             _______\r<br>\r<br>            focus so heavily on both defendants' intent and the effect of\r<br>\r<br>            defendants' actions on non-parties to this case.  The Supreme\r<br>\r<br>            Court has squarely rejected the argument that classifications\r<br>\r<br>            motivated   by   \"benign\"   considerations   should  not   be\r<br>\r<br>            scrutinized strictly.   See  Adarand, 515 U.S.  at 226.   And\r                                    ___  _______\r<br>\r<br>            though this  case does appear  unique in that  the government\r<br>\r<br>            conduct at  issue is more  a withdrawal of a  special benefit\r<br>\r<br>            from whites than  a giving of special benefits  to members of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -24-\r                                         -24-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            minority groups,9 the  clear import of Adarand is  that it is\r                                                   _______\r<br>\r<br>            the  plaintiff's \"personal right  to equal protection  of the\r                              ________\r<br>\r<br>            laws,\" 515 U.S. at 227,  and not some non-party's interest in\r<br>\r<br>            competing for that which would be the plaintiff's but for his\r<br>\r<br>            or her race, that is constitutionally safeguarded.   Thus, in\r<br>\r<br>            evaluating the constitutionality  of defendants' conduct,  we\r<br>\r<br>            must not  look to its  effect and motivation with  respect to\r<br>\r<br>            others;  we  must  look at  its  effect  and  motivation with\r<br>\r<br>            respect  to plaintiffs.  And here, quite clearly, defendants'\r<br>\r<br>            conduct has  had  the effect  of  depriving plaintiffs  of  a\r<br>\r<br>            benefit  and was  prompted by  the fact  that plaintiffs  are\r<br>\r<br>            mostly white.   \r<br>\r<br>                      Because  defendants'   conduct  should   have  been\r<br>\r<br>            strictly  scrutinized, their  motion  to dismiss  plaintiffs'\r<br>\r<br>            equal  protection  claim  should have  been  denied  and they\r<br>\r<br>            should  have been  required to  produce  evidence that  their\r<br>\r<br>            conduct  was  narrowly  tailored  to  advance   a  compelling\r<br>\r<br>            governmental   interest.    See  Adarand,  515  U.S.  at  227\r                                        ___  _______\r<br>\r<br>            (reciting the components of the strict scrutiny inquiry); see\r                                                                      ___\r<br>\r<br>            also Aiken  v.
