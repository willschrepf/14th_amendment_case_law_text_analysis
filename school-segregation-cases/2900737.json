The Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed, concluding that, because the victim was sleeping, there was\ninsufficient evidence he used “forcible compulsion,” as the sodomy statute requires.\nMo. Rev. Stat. § 566.060(1). The Missouri Supreme Court reinstated the conviction,\nState v. Niederstadt, 66 S.W.3d 12 (Mo. banc 2002), and denied Niederstadt’s motion\n\ffor rehearing. Niederstadt then petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus. The\ndistrict court granted the writ, concluding that Niederstadt’s Fourteenth Amendment\nright to due process was violated by the Missouri Supreme Court’s construction of the\nsodomy statute that was “unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which\nhad been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.” Niederstadt v. Purkett, No.\n4:02CV00847, slip op. at 11 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 27, 2005), quoting Bouie v. City of\nColumbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354 (1964). The State appealed, and a divided panel of this\ncourt affirmed. Niederstadt v. Nixon, 465 F.3d 843 (8th Cir. 2006). We granted the\nState's petition for rehearing en banc and now reverse.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      We quote the Supreme Court of Missouri's undisputed recitation of the\nbackground facts, 66 S.W.2d at 14:\n\n            The victim, S.C., was a sixteen-year-old female at the time of the\n      alleged sodomy in 1992. She was the daughter of American missionaries\n      serving in Gambia, West Africa. In 1991, S.C. was sent by her parents\n      to Malden, Missouri, to attend high school and to live with defendant and\n      his family. Prior to coming to defendant's home, she had no sexual\n      experience. In July and August of 1991, defendant began engaging in\n      inappropriate kissing on the lips and fondling of the girl's breasts and\n      touching her between her legs.\n\n             At the religious school she attended, she began getting into\n      trouble. The school administered detention as punishment. Defendant's\n      punishment was to administer whippings to the girl's buttocks, back, and\n      legs. He contended the girl was \"rebellious and needed it.\" The beatings\n      were so severe that S.C. suffered bruising, making it painful for her to\n      walk and difficult for her to participate in physical education classes.\n      The beatings occurred about once per month during her stay in the\n      Niederstadt home. Sometimes on the morning after a beating, the\n      defendant would come into S.C.'s room, take off her clothes and\n      underwear, and count her bruises out loud. Following one such beating,\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      defendant attempted to strangle S.C., squeezing her neck and repeatedly\n      saying, \"I could kill you right now.\" He eventually released her.\n      Because of the beatings and threats, on one occasion S.C. attempted to\n      run away from the defendant's home but returned the same day. S.C.\n      stated that she was afraid to report the sexual misconduct to authorities.\n\n            Like the beatings, the fondling incidents continued throughout the\n      school year, usually occurring in the early morning. Defendant would\n      come into the girl's room and place his hand under her clothes and\n      underwear. While he touched her, he would masturbate.\n\n             The information alleged that the [sodomy] occurred in March of\n      1992. The victim testified to several such incidents but only gave details\n      as to one in March of 1992. S.C. testified that she had been feeling sick\n      and went to sleep in her room. She was awakened by a sharp pain which\n      she discovered was caused by defendant's finger in her vagina. When\n      she awoke, defendant told S.C. he was \"checking [her] temperature.\"\n      Defendant admitted to that incident. S.C. testified that later in March\n      there were other occasions when defendant penetrated her vagina with\n      his finger.\n\n      Niederstadt was charged with sodomy in violation of § 566.060(1). The statute\nprohibited “deviate sexual intercourse with another person without that person’s\nconsent by the use of forcible compulsion.” It is conceded that Niederstadt's digital\npenetration constituted “deviate sexual intercourse” as defined in § 566.010(1). As\nrelevant here, \"forcible compulsion\" was defined as “[p]hysical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” § 556.061(12)(a).\n\n       After a bench trial, the trial court denied Niederstadt's motion for judgment of\nacquittal and found him guilty of sodomy. The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed,\nconcluding that, because Niederstadt “initiated the sexual act while [the victim] slept”\nand stopped when she awakened, there was no evidence he used forcible compulsion.\nThe fact that he used forcible compulsion on other occasions, the Court reasoned, did\nnot supply the requisite proof that it was used in committing the charged offense.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fState v. Niederstadt, No. 23612, 2001 WL 995937 (Mo. App. July 23, 2001). A\nconcurring opinion criticized “the State's failure to analyze its evidence and file a\ncharge the evidence will support.”\n\n       The Supreme Court of Missouri granted discretionary review, concluded that\nNiederstadt's conduct constituted sodomy under Missouri law, and reinstated the\nconviction and sentence. The Court first noted there can be “no question but that\ndefendant used physical force to insert his finger in the girl’s vagina.” Niederstadt,\n66 S.W.3d at 15. The Court then discussed the “critical question” of “whether the acts\nof deviate sexual intercourse were done by use of physical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” Id. (quotation omitted). The Court looked to the coercive\nbeatings, threats, and sexual indecencies the forty-year-old Niederstadt had previously\ninflicted on a sixteen-year-old girl who was living in his home. The Court concluded\nthat Niederstadt’s conduct and his “complete control and dominance over every aspect\nof the girl’s life” provided sufficient evidence for the court to find that he used\nphysical force that overcame “[t]he reasonable resistance expected of an unconscious\nor sleeping person.” Id. at 16. Niederstadt moved for rehearing, raising as a due\nprocess issue that the Court had “unforeseeably expanded the scope of conduct that\nmight be prosecuted under § 566.060.” The Supreme Court of Missouri summarily\ndenied that motion. Niederstadt then timely filed this petition for federal habeas relief.\n\n                                           II.\n\n        The State first argues that Niederstadt’s due process claim is procedurally\nbarred. Federal habeas relief may not be granted on a claim that the state appellate\ncourt declined to address because the petitioner failed to meet a state procedural\nrequirement constituting an “independent and adequate state ground.” Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U.S. 722, 730 (1991). An “independent and adequate” ground is one\nthat is “firmly established and regularly followed” by the time it is applied. Ford v.\nGeorgia, 498 U.S. 411, 424 (1991). “When a state court decides an issue on the merits\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdespite a possible procedural default, no independent and adequate state ground bars\nconsideration of that claim by a [federal] habeas court.” Sweet v. Delo, 125 F.3d\n1144, 1150 (8th Cir. 1997), cert. denied sub nom. Sweet v. Bowersox, 523 U.S. 1010\n(1998).\n\n      Under Missouri law, “to preserve a constitutional issue for appellate review, it\nmust be raised at the earliest time consistent with good pleading and orderly\nprocedure.” State v. Wickizer, 583 S.W.2d 519, 523 (Mo.banc 1979). The State\nargues that Niederstadt defaulted his due process claim because it was first raised in\nhis motion for rehearing to the Supreme Court of Missouri. The State explains that,\nbecause its brief to that Court urged the interpretation of the sodomy statute the Court\nultimately adopted, Niederstadt had both notice and opportunity to raise a due process\nobjection in his responsive brief, before the Court ruled.\n\n       After careful review of the record, we conclude this issue was not properly\npreserved and presented by the State. The record on appeal does not reveal whether\nthe State argued procedural default to the Supreme Court of Missouri in opposing\nNiederstadt's motion for rehearing. The Court's summary denial of rehearing is\ncustomary and gives no indication that the Court was invoking a procedural bar,\nparticularly if the State did not argue that the due process issue was defaulted. In\nthese circumstances, we infer the state court denied this issue on the merits, not on an\nindependent and adequate procedural ground. See Muth v. Frank, 412 F.3d 808, 815-\n16 (7th Cir.) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 988 (2005). Moreover, the State\ncites only the readily distinguishable Wickizer case, which does not begin to establish\nthat the state court would have been applying a “firmly established and regularly\nfollowed” principle if it had ruled the due process claim procedurally defaulted on the\nunusual procedural facts of this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f                                           III.\n\n       Turning to the merits of Niederstadt's due process claim, in Bouie the state\nsupreme court construed a statute, which on its face limited criminal trespass to\nwrongful entries, as including the refusal by peaceful civil rights demonstrators to\nobey a proprietor's order to leave a racially segregated restaurant otherwise open to\nthe public. The Court held that this retroactive judicial expansion of the statute's\ncriminal prohibition violated the defendants' due process rights. As later clarified,\nBouie's due process restriction on judicial interpretation of criminal statutes is limited\nto those “that are 'unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been\nexpressed prior to the conduct in issue.'” Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 461\n(2001), quoting Bouie, 378 U.S. at 354. Unlike judicial review of retroactive\nlegislation under the broader Ex Post Facto Clause, review of a court's application of\na criminal statute to a particular defendant, which by its nature is retroactive, “rest[s]\non core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to\nfair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal\npenalties to what previously had been innocent conduct.” Rogers, 532 U.S. at 459.\n\n       Niederstadt argues the Missouri Supreme Court’s determination that he used\nforcible compulsion sufficient to violate the sodomy statute violated his right to due\nprocess because, contrary to prior reported decisions, the Court ruled that the forcible\ncoercion element is satisfied by the force inherent in a sex offense committed on a\nsleeping victim, who cannot resist. This ruling was “unexpected and indefensible,”\nhe argues, because it rendered the forcible coercion element surplusage, eliminated the\nstatutory requirement that the defendant “use” forcible coercion, and impermissibly\nequated sodomy with lesser uncharged sex crimes that did not require proof of forcible\ncoercion. The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded that its interpretation of the\nsodomy statute did not conflict with the narrow due process restriction of Bouie and\nRogers. The task of a federal habeas court is to determine whether that conclusion\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fwas an “unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby the Supreme Court.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n      1. At the time Niederstadt committed the offense, the Supreme Court of\nMissouri had not construed the term “forcible compulsion” in § 566.010, nor the\nterm's statutory definition in § 556.061(12)(a), “[p]hysical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” The Missouri Court of Appeals had construed these statutes\nin a number of cases. In only one prior case had that Court reversed a Missouri\nsodomy conviction because the evidence failed to establish use of forcible\ncompulsion. State v. Daleske, 866 S.W.2d 476 (Mo. App. 1993). In reinstating\nNiederstadt's conviction, the Supreme Court of Missouri carefully considered the\nCourt of Appeals decision in Daleske and found it “readily distinguishable” because\nthe defendant in Daleske employed only de minimis force and threats, whereas here\nthe victim “was awakened by a sharp pain which she discovered was caused by\ndefendant’s finger in her vagina” and suffered other “beatings, physical threats [and]\nsexual assaults.” Niederstadt, 66 S.W.3d at 16, 14.1\n\n        In Rogers, a divided Court refused to extend Bouie to a state court decision\noverruling a common law rule that would have barred petitioner’s conviction. Like\nBouie, this case involves a state court decision construing a criminal statute. Thus,\nit is instructive to consider how the dissenting Justices in Rogers -- those who would\nhave extended Bouie -- would apply Bouie in this type of case:\n\n\n      1\n        We disagree with Niederstadt's assertion that the Supreme Court of Missouri’s\ndecision collapsed the distinct offenses of sodomy and deviate sexual assault, defined\nin § 566.070(1) as deviate sexual intercourse without the victim's consent. By\ndistinguishing Daleske as involving only de minimis force and threats, the Court\npreserved a distinction between the offenses. 66 S.W.3d at 16. Moreover, as there is\nno Double Jeopardy Clause concern, we fail to see why such a collapse would violate\ndue process so long as it was not an “unexpected and indefensible” interpretation of\nstate law. As we shall explain, this interpretation was neither.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      Many criminal cases present some factual nuance that arguably\n      distinguishes them from cases that have come before; a court applying\n      the penal statute to the new fact pattern does not purport to change the\n      law. That, however, is not the action before us here, but rather, a square,\n      head-on overruling of prior law . . . .\n\n532 U.S. at 471 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In this case, the Supreme Court of Missouri\ndid not overrule prior law, it applied the governing statute to a new fact pattern,\nengaging in the type of fact-based analysis described in Justice Scalia’s dissent.\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court of Missouri had not previously considered the statute,\nthere was no prior governing law to overrule. As we said in Hagan v. Caspari, 50 F.3d\n542, 547 (8th Cir. 1995), \"until the state's highest court has spoken on a particular\npoint of state law, the law of the state necessarily must be regarded as unsettled.\" A\nruling on an unsettled issue of state law will rarely if ever be unexpected and\nindefensible.\n\n       2. Niederstadt argues that the Supreme Court of Missouri's construction of “use\nof forcible compulsion” reconfigured the sodomy statute in a totally unexpected way\nby eliminating the State's need to prove the defendant used force over and above the\nsex act itself to overcome the victim's reasonable resistance. But this argument\nignores over one hundred years of Missouri criminal statutes and judicial decisions.\nIn State v. Welch, 89 S.W. 945 (Mo. 1905), the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed\nthe rape conviction of a man who penetrated a sleeping victim and continued the\nassault when she awakened. The penal code then defined rape as “forcibly ravishing\nany woman” who had reached the age of fourteen. The Court explained:\n\n      To ravish a woman is to have carnal connection with her forcibly, and\n      without her consent . . . . The general, if not universal, rule is that, if a\n      man have connection with a woman while she is asleep, he is guilty of\n      rape, because the act is without her consent.\n\n                                  *    *   *     *   *\n\n                                           -8-\n\f      [The victim] knew nothing about the assault . . . until she awoke . . . at\n      which time the penetration had already been made and the offense\n      completed. After that no submission or consent of the prosecutrix could\n      avail the defendant.\n\n                                   *   *    *    *    *\n\n      [T]he crime is not mitigated by the fact that it was committed while the\n      prosecutrix was asleep.\n\n89 S.W. at 947-48. In other words, the court equated unconsented penetration of a\nsleeping woman with forcible rape.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Missouri expanded the rule of Welch in State v. Atkins,\n292 S.W. 422 (Mo. 1926), affirming the rape conviction of a physician who while\nexamining a patient penetrated her by surprise and stopped when she protested. The\nCourt explained:\n\n      It is plain that, if appellant did penetrate prosecutrix sexually . . . no more\n      physical force was employed by him than is necessarily incident to such\n      an act when done with the consent of the woman. . . . One phase of the\n      contention concerning the insufficiency of the evidence is that . . . the\n      alleged act of ravishment was not forcible within the meaning of [the\n      statute]. . . . But the law has been otherwise declared in this state.\n\n                                   *   *    *    *    *\n\n      If it is rape under our statutes for a man to have illicit sexual connection\n      with a woman while she is asleep, and incapable of consenting . . . we\n      are unable to see why it is not also rape for a man to have improper\n      sexual connection with a woman by accomplishing penetration through\n      surprise . . . . In all cases of that sort the physical force merely to effect\n      penetration without the employment of further force to overcome\n      resistance, together with the want of consent, should, and, under the rule\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f      announced in the Welch Case, does, constitute force within the meaning\n      of our statute defining and punishing rape.\n\n292 S.W. at 425-26 (emphasis added).\n\n      Welch and Atkins were rape cases, not sodomy cases. In 1979, the Missouri\nLegislature revised the statutes governing both rape and sodomy. The rape statute was\namended to change the “ravishing” language to “use of forcible compulsion.” Mo.\nRev. Stat. § 566.030(1). But the Comment to that subsection advised that it\n“continues the common law concept of forcible rape -- intercourse by 'forcible\ncompulsion'.” At the same time, the sodomy statute, which had previously defined the\ncrime without regard to force or lack of consent, was amended in § 566.060(1) to\ninclude the same “use of forcible compulsion” language adopted to define rape. The\nComment to this statute advised, “The provisions of this section correspond with the\nrape provisions of § 566.030.”\n\n       This historical review makes crystal clear what common sense teaches -- it was\nneither unexpected nor indefensible for the Supreme Court of Missouri to construe the\nMissouri rape and sodomy statutes in effect when Niederstadt committed his offense\nas applying to the unconsented penetration of a sleeping woman, just as the Court had\napplied prior rape statutes for a century, consistent with “[t]he general, if not\nuniversal, rule.” Nor is there reason to infer that 1979 legislative amendments\ndescribed as continuing the historic concept of forcible rape, and applying that\nconcept to the crime of sodomy, were intended to overrule this longstanding judicial\ninterpretation.2 Thus, Niederstadt had the fair notice due process requires that his\n\n\n      2\n        In language since repealed, the 1979 version of § 566.070.1 made “deviate\nsexual intercourse with another person . . . who is incapacitated” a class C felony\npunishable less severely than sodomy. A definitional provision, § 566.020.1, clarified\nthat “incapacity” in this context did not include sleeping. Moreover, if unclear, the\nSupreme Court of Missouri's resolution of that question would not violate Bouie.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdespicable sexual abuse of a sleeping teenage victim would be punished in this\nfashion. As Bouie requires no more, the Supreme Court of Missouri's denial of\nNiederstadt's due process claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law and must be upheld under our deferential standard of review.\n\n       The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with\ninstructions to deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge, with whom GRUENDER, Circuit Judge, joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n\n       I conclude that James Niederstadt’s due process claim was procedurally\ndefaulted in the Missouri courts, and that he is barred from pursuing it in this federal\nhabeas corpus proceeding. I therefore concur in the judgment reversing the decision\nof the district court.\n\n        Under Missouri law, a constitutional claim must be raised at the earliest\nopportunity, State v. Galazin, 58 S.W.3d 500, 505 (Mo. 2001), and a state prisoner\nwho fails to present his claim in accordance with state procedure is barred from\nraising the claim in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. Sweet v. Delo, 125 F.3d\n1144, 1149-50 (8th Cir. 1997). Whether or not Niederstadt was required to raise his\ndue process claim in the trial court, he had an adequate opportunity to present the\nclaim to the Supreme Court of Missouri after that court accepted transfer of the case\nfrom the Missouri Court of Appeals. The trial court had entered a judgment that\nNiederstadt violated § 566.060(1) of the Missouri Revised Statutes. Two alternative\narguments were available to Niederstadt on appeal: (1) as a matter of Missouri law,\nthe trial court erred in concluding that the statute encompassed his conduct, and (2)\nif the trial court’s conclusion that the statute did reach his conduct was correct as a\nmatter of state law, then the result was so unexpected and indefensible as to violate\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Rogers v. Tennessee, 532\n\n                                         -11-\n\fU.S. 451, 457 (2001). As the State points out, this is the very course followed by the\ndefendant in Rogers, see State v. Rogers, 992 S.W.2d 393, 401-02 (Tenn. 1999), and\nan opportunity to raise the constitutional claim likewise was readily available to\nNiederstadt.\n\n      The state supreme court’s summary denial of Niederstadt’s motion for\nrehearing, in which he raised a federal due process claim for the first time, should not\nbe construed as opening up the merits of a previously defaulted federal issue. The\npurpose of a motion for rehearing under Missouri law is “to call attention to material\nmatters of law or fact overlooked or misinterpreted by the court, as shown by its\nopinion or order of dismissal.” Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.17 (2002); Diamond v. Wyrick,\n757 F.2d 192, 193 (8th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). The Supreme Court of Missouri has\nfirmly established and regularly followed a rule in appeals that it will not consider\nnew issues raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing. Allen v. Globe-\nDemocrat Publishing Co., 368 S.W.2d 460, 467 (Mo. 1963) (per curiam); see Graf\nv. Wire Rope Corp. of America, 861 S.W.2d 588, 592 (Mo. App. 1993).\n\n       There is no cause to conclude that the State failed to preserve or present the\nissue of procedural default in the state court proceedings. The State was forbidden by\nthe rules of court to file a response to Niederstadt’s motion for rehearing unless the\nstate supreme court requested one, Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.17 (2002); Beach v. State, 220\nS.W.3d 360, 366 n.1 (Mo. App. 2007) (per curiam), and the docket reflects that the\ncourt denied Niederstadt’s motion for rehearing without seeking a response.\n(Appellee’s App. 16). Niederstadt cites no appeal in which the Supreme Court of\nMissouri has considered the merits of a claim raised for the first time in a motion for\nrehearing. Nothing in the court’s summary denial of Niederstadt’s motion suggests\nthat the decision “rest[ed] primarily on federal law” or was “interwoven with the\nfederal law.” See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 733 (1991). The natural\ninference from the summary order – particularly given that it was entered without\nseeking an opposing brief on Niederstadt’s new constitutional claim – is that the court\n\n                                         -12-\n\fdid not depart from its longstanding refusal to consider new issues on rehearing. See\nByrd v. Delo, 942 F.2d 1226, 1231-32 (8th Cir. 1991). Consistent with this view, our\nprecedent holds that raising a claim for the first time in a motion for rehearing before\nthe Supreme Court of Missouri does not avoid a procedural bar. Tokar v. Bowersox,\n198 F.3d 1039, 1046 n.7 (8th Cir. 1999).3\n\n       For these reasons, Niederstadt defaulted his due process claim in state court\npursuant to an independent and adequate procedural rule in Missouri. Therefore,\nreview of the federal claim is barred in this proceeding unless Niederstadt shows cause\nfor the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged constitutional violation,\nor demonstrates that failure to consider the claim will result in a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750. Niederstadt does not argue “cause”\nand “prejudice,” but the district court thought the claim should be considered, even\nassuming a procedural default, under the miscarriage of justice or “actual innocence”\nexception to procedural default. Rejecting the recommendation of a magistrate judge\nthat the claim was procedurally barred, the district court reasoned that Niederstadt has\nproduced “clear and convincing evidence that, absent the supreme court’s unlawful\nbroadening of the forcible sodomy statute, no reasonable court would have found\n[him] guilty of the crime under existing facts.” Niederstadt v. Purkett, No.\n\n\n      3\n        The court’s alternative suggestion, ante, at 5, that the State has failed to show\nthat the Supreme Court of Missouri relied on a procedural rule that is “firmly\nestablished and regularly followed” presumably is dictum, for resolution of the default\nquestion on that basis would be inconsistent with the court’s conclusion that\nNiederstadt’s constitutional claim should be reviewed under the deferential standard\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). If the state court purported to rely on a procedural ground in\nrejecting the federal constitutional claim, but that ground is later deemed inadequate\nto bar federal habeas review, then the federal claim was not adjudicated on the merits\nby the state court, see Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F.3d 458, 461 (8th Cir. 2004) (en\nbanc), and the pre-AEDPA standard of review likely would apply. See Silverman v.\nEdwards, 69 F. App’x 489, 491 (2d Cir. 2003); cf. Clemons v. Luebbers, 381 F.3d\n744, 755 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                          -13-\n\f4:02CV00847, slip op. at 7 n.7 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 27, 2005) (citing Sawyer v. Whitley,\n505 U.S. 333, 336 (1992)).\n\n        I disagree with Niederstadt’s contention that he may avoid the procedural\ndefault by showing a “miscarriage of justice” under the circumstances of this case.\nThis exception to default “is concerned with actual as compared to legal innocence,”\nSawyer, 505 U.S. at 339, and the term “actual innocence” means “factual innocence.”\nBousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998); McNeal v. United States, 249 F.3d\n747, 749 (8th Cir. 2001). Niederstadt presents no new evidence of factual innocence,\ncf. Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 324 (1995), and he does not deny any of the factual\nallegations advanced during his prosecution. There is no dispute that he was factually\nguilty of violating § 566.060(1) as the statute was interpreted by the Supreme Court\nof Missouri. Niederstadt’s argument that federal law prohibited the Missouri courts\nfrom interpreting the state statute to encompass his conduct is purely legal.\n\n       Niederstadt’s reliance on the “miscarriage of justice” exception, moreover,\nimplies that a defendant never could default a due process claim based on Rogers or\nBouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354 (1964), for if the claim had merit, then\nthe defendant would always be “actually innocent.” And because the defaulted due\nprocess claim would not be adjudicated on the merits by the state courts, see 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d), a habeas corpus applicant would always be entitled to de novo review of\nhis constitutional claim raised for the first time in federal court, while applicants who\npresent the due process claim in state court must proceed under the deferential review\nstandards of AEDPA. This is an unlikely construct, and it finds no support in federal\ndecisions enforcing state procedural bars with respect to similar constitutional claims\nbased on Rogers or Bouie. See Chambers v. McCaughtry, 264 F.3d 732, 739 (7th Cir.\n2001); Coley v. Belleque, No. 03-569, 2006 WL 1007248, at *1 (D. Or. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f      For these reasons, I conclude that Niederstadt is not entitled to relief. I\ntherefore concur in the judgment reversing the decision of the district court and\nremanding with instructions to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n\nARNOLD, Circuit Judge, with whom WOLLMAN and BYE, Circuit Judges, join,\ndissenting.\n\n      I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the court because the court applies\nan incorrect standard in reviewing Mr. Niederstadt's claim and reaches the wrong\nconclusion on its merits.\n\n                                            I.\n       The court does not acknowledge that there is an issue with respect to whether\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) standard of review, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), applies to Mr. Niederstadt's claim: It passes over the matter\nentirely. After deciding that the state of Missouri had not properly preserved the issue\nof procedural default in state court, the court simply states that \"[t]he task of a federal\nhabeas court is to determine whether [a state court's] conclusion was an 'unreasonable\napplication of ... clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt.' \" But that standard applies only if Mr. Niederstadt's claim was \"adjudicated\non the merits in state court.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n      The court, in discussing the question of procedural default, relies on Muth v.\nFrank, 412 F.3d 808 (7th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 988 (2005), for the\nproposition that if a state court denies a claim summarily we should presume that it\ndecided it on the merits. But the motion for rehearing that Mr. Niederstadt filed in the\nMissouri Supreme Court contains claims asserting that the court's interpretation and\napplication of Missouri statutes was wrong both under Missouri law and the due\nprocess clause. The Missouri Supreme Court's response was a one-line order stating\nsimply that Mr. Niederstadt's \"motion for rehearing is overruled.\" The order did not\n\n                                           -15-\n\fdiscuss or even acknowledge Mr. Niederstadt's constitutional claim or any other claim\nthat he raised.\n\n       Although in James v. Bowersox, 187 F.3d 866, 869 (8th Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 528 U.S. 1143 (2000), we stated that \"the summary nature of a state court's\nruling does not affect the § 2254(d)(1) standard of review,\" the state court in James\nhad reviewed the federal claim and \"label[ed]\" it \" 'without merit.' \" Likewise, Weeks\nv. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 231, 237 (2000), is distinguishable: In that case, the state\ncourt had specifically referred to the claim at issue (issue \"44\"), along with several\nothers, \"considered\" them, and found that they had \"no merit.\" Weeks v. Virginia,\n248 Va. 460, 465, 450 S.W.2d 379, 383 (1994).\n\n        Since our decision in James, moreover, we have remarked that determining\nwhen a state court has decided an issue on the merits is \"not so easy\" and indicated\nthat there are no hard-and-fast rules. Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F.3d 458, 460-61 (8th\nCir. 2004) (en banc), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1189 (2005). Indeed, in that case, both\nthe court's and the dissenting opinion discussed at length the question of whether the\nstate court had reached petitioner's federal claim or had decided only the state claim\nthat was based on the same factual predicate. Because of all the labor devoted to that\nquestion, it is plain that both opinions in Brown proceeded on the assumption that if\nthe state court exhibited no apparent awareness of the federal claim or gave no hint\nthat it had considered it, we could not conclude that it had been adjudicated on the\nmerits. And more recently we conducted a detailed examination of a state court\nopinion before determining that it resolved a particular claim on the merits. Weaver\nv. Bowersox, 438 F.3d 832, 838-39 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\n       Thus, the premise of all of our previous relevant cases seems to be that when\na state court has said nothing with respect to a federal claim, we can have no basis for\nconcluding that it had adjudicated it. It therefore comes as a surprise to learn that we\nnow have a binary approach to such matters: If a claim was dismissed for something\n\n                                         -16-\n\fother than a procedural default, it must necessarily have been adjudicated on the\nmerits. Perhaps there is some justification for this rule, but the court offers none, and\nin the process overrules sub silentio a number of our cases that are inconsistent with\nany such principle. Or maybe our previous cases can be distinguished on the ground\nthat in them the state court did discuss some claims and thus it might reasonably be\ninferred that the state court simply overlooked some claim or claims that went\nunmentioned. But the court here does not make that distinction, and I would not be\ninclined to make it either, for reasons that I allude to later.\n\n       It might also be argued that we ought not to presume that a state court has not\nconsidered a claim just because it did not mention it. After all, it often happens that\nappellate courts fail to discuss assignments of error without mentioning them directly,\nbut the court's judgment presumably concludes them nevertheless. But this kind of\nreasoning probably makes less sense when, as here, the state and federal claims are\nbased on the same factual predicate, and the court does not advance this argument in\ndefense of its ruling.\n\n       I think, moreover, that the principle apparently adhered to in our previous cases\nhas a better claim to recognition than the one that the court adopts. First of all, one\napparent purpose of AEDPA is to promote comity and to provide a certain amount of\ndeference to the place of state courts in our overall federal system. The statute was\nintended to increase respect for state court judgments: It is therefore the states'\ninterests that are at stake here, and they should be alert to their vindication. I see no\nreason to encourage state courts to be laconic. Nor do I believe that it burdens a state\ncourt significantly to require it to devise an order that will allow a federal court to\ndiscern whether the state court has adjudicated a federal claim. The statute, moreover,\ndoes not by its own terms apply unless the federal claim has been adjudicated; and if\nthe relevant state court order is opaque with respect to whether it decides a matter, the\ncondition in the statute is not satisfied. To put it another way, if a state wants to claim\nthe shelter that the statute provides, it has the burden to show that it is entitled to it.\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       It is important to appreciate that in passing AEDPA Congress meant only to\nlimit a state prisoner's right to an unrestricted review of a habeas claim, not to\neliminate it. By requiring that a claim be adjudicated on the merits in state court\nbefore the review by a federal court would be restricted, I believe that Congress made\nclear that a habeas petitioner must receive an unrestricted, i.e., de novo, review of his\nor her constitutional claims by either a state or federal court. We therefore correctly\nconducted an intensive review in our previous cases to determine whether the state\ncourt in fact had decided the federal claim at issue. When forced to choose between\npossibly depriving a habeas petitioner of unrestricted review by any court and\nrequiring a state court simply to say that it conducted such a review, I think that\nCongress's intent compels us to choose the latter.\n\n      I would therefore review Mr. Niederstadt's claim de novo.\n\n                                          II.\n       Even assuming for the sake of argument that the due process claim here was\nadjudicated on the merits and AEDPA therefore applies, I believe that Mr. Niederstadt\nwould be entitled to habeas relief. In those cases in which the state court decides an\nissue but provides no explanation, we \"conduct an independent review of the record\nand applicable law to determine whether state court decision is contrary to federal law\n[or] unreasonably applies clearly established law.\" Harris v. Stovall, 212 F.3d 940,\n943 (6th Cir. 2000). For the reasons that follow, I believe that the state court's denial\nof Mr. Niederstadt's due process claim is an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished Supreme Court due-process precedent.\n\n      Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court said that \"[t]he basic principle that a\ncriminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a crime has often\nbeen recognized by this Court.\" Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 350-51\n(1964). While the due process clause does not incorporate the specific prohibitions\nof the ex post facto clause, Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 458 (2001), the\n\n                                          -18-\n\f\"concepts of notice [and] foreseeability\" are at its core, id. at 459. Thus the due\nprocess clause is violated when a court gives retroactive effect to \"a judicial\nconstruction of a criminal statute [that] is 'unexpected and indefensible by reference\nto the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' \" Bouie, 378 U.S.\nat 354 (quoting Jerome Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960));\nsee also Rogers, 532 U.S. at 461.\n\n      The Missouri sodomy statute, at the time of Mr. Niederstadt's conduct,\nprohibited \"deviate sexual intercourse with another person without that person's\nconsent by the use of forcible compulsion.\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.060.1 (Supp. 1991).\nDeviate sexual intercourse included \"any sexual act involving the genitals of one\nperson and the mouth, tongue, hand, or anus of another person.\" Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 566.010(1) (Supp. 1991). Forcible compulsion was defined as \"physical force that\novercomes reasonable resistance\" or \"a threat, express or implied, that places a person\nin reasonable fear of death, serious physical injury, or kidnapping of himself or\nanother person.\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 556.061(12) (Supp. 1991).\n\n       Mr. Niederstadt admits that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict\nhim of deviate sexual assault in the first degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.070(1) (1986),\nwhich applied when the victim was an incapacitated person, or deviate sexual assault\nin the second degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.080(1) (1986), which applied to an assault\nof a sixteen-year-old victim by a person seventeen years or older. Neither of these\ncrimes included the element of forcible compulsion. Mr. Niederstadt argues that he\ndid not use forcible compulsion to accomplish the act, and that the Missouri Supreme\nCourt's construction of § 556.061(12)(a) to include his conduct diverged so widely\nfrom the law as it existed at the time of his offense as to violate his due process rights.\n\n       The Missouri Supreme Court held that Mr. Niederstadt used physical force\nagainst S.C., a minor dependent on him for care, in such a manner that her reasonable\nresistance to his sexual assaults was greatly reduced and then sodomized her while she\n\n                                           -19-\n\fslept. The act of penetrating S.C.'s vagina itself required force to be applied to her\nbody, the court noted, and it held that that satisfied the physical force element of the\nstatute. Niederstadt II, 66 S.W.3d at 14-16.\n\n       Under Bouie, we must determine what law \"had been expressed prior to the\nconduct in issue.\" We first examine the statutory language: The statute, after all, is\nthe primary expression of the law applicable to this case. Section 566.060 required\nthat the \"deviate sexual intercourse\" be accomplished \"by the use of forcible\ncompulsion\" (emphasis added); it does not give notice that the intercourse itself can\nbe the force used to accomplish the intercourse or that a sleeping or unconscious\nvictim can be \"compelled.\" Under § 556.061(12), \"forcible compulsion\" is defined\nas \"physical force that overcomes reasonable resistance,\" but this definition does\nnothing to bring Mr. Niederstadt's conduct within the scope of § 566.060: It provides\nno notice that \"physical force\" can be the intercourse itself or that the victim (whose\n\"reasonable resistance\" is overcome) may be asleep. Therefore we do not believe that\nthe statutory language provided \"fair warning\" that Mr. Niederstadt's conduct came\nwithin the terms of the crime with which he was charged.\n\n       Case law also plainly failed to provide the notice that due process requires. No\nMissouri case before Mr. Niederstadt's holds or implies that the force necessary for\nforcible compulsion is equivalent to the performance of the sexual act which the\nstatute states the forcible compulsion is used to accomplish. Nor had any case held\nor implied that a defendant could be convicted under § 566.060 when the victim was\nasleep and unaware of the acts alleged to be \"forcible compulsion.\" For example, in\nState v. R_ D_ G_, 733 S.W.2d 824, 827 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987), the court's discussion\nof force focused on the defendant's grabbing and holding the victim's arms and\ndragging her into a bedroom. Here S.C. testified that she was not even aware that\nMr. Niederstadt was in the room until she awoke and, according to the Missouri\nSupreme Court, the deviate sexual intercourse had already been accomplished \"by the\nuse of forcible compulsion,\" Mo. Rev. Stat. 566.060.\n\n                                         -20-\n\f       In holding that the force used to penetrate S.C.'s vagina could fulfill the element\nof forcible compulsion, the Missouri Supreme Court reconfigured the sodomy statutes\nin an unexpected way. Under this construction, the element of \"forcible compulsion\"\ncollapses into the element of \"deviate sexual intercourse,\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.060.1\n(Supp. 1991), and sodomy, when committed against a victim from whom virtually no\nreasonable resistance is expected, such as the sleeping victim here, becomes\nindistinguishable from the offense of deviate sexual intercourse in the second degree,\nwhich did not require proof of forcible compulsion. At the time of Mr. Niederstadt's\nconduct, neither the plain language of the sodomy statute nor the case law supported\nsuch a construction. Where, as here, a court construes a criminal statute in a new way\nthat removes an entire element from it, it violates the principle of fair warning that\nunderlies the constitutional right to due process if, in the same case, the court uses that\nnew statutory interpretation to uphold the defendant's conviction.\n\n       As often happens, the state makes arguments and relies on authorities in its\npresentation to the en banc court that it never made to the district court or to the panel\nof our court that heard the case originally. The fact that this tack is late-blooming is\nevidence enough that the state did not originally regard these authorities as relevant,\nand rightly so. The court nevertheless adopts the state's new arguments when it holds,\nante at 8-10, that some old cases dealing with rape are helpful here. See State v.\nWelch, 89 S.W. 945 (Mo. 1905); State v. Atkins, 292 S.W. 422 (Mo. 1926). But those\ncases are inapposite because they do not deal with a calibrated statutory scheme that\ndeliberately distinguishes forcible sexual acts from acts that are committed on the\nincapacitated, including, presumably, the insensate.\n\n       The court also maintains, ante at 7 n.1, that the Missouri Supreme Court\npreserved the distinction between the two offenses at issue here, but in fact the state\ncourt's attempt to distinguish State v. Daleske, 866 S.W.2d 476 (Mo. App. 1993), was\nat best startling and at worst entirely fanciful. The court also remarks, ante at 7 n.1,\nthat collapsing the two offenses would not be unconstitutional unless it was\n\n                                           -21-\n\funexpected and indefensible. But surely the court does not mean to say that it expects\nstate courts to collapse statutes or that it would defend state courts that did so.\n\n       I would therefore conclude that the Missouri Supreme Court's decision was an\nunreasonable interpretation of United States Supreme Court due-process jurisprudence\nin Bouie and other cases because I believe that it is quite obvious that neither the plain\nlanguage of the statute nor state case law at the time of Mr. Niederstadt's conduct\ndefined \"forcible compulsion\" as encompassing his conduct. I agree with the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals, which stated in its opinion reversing Mr. Niederstadt's conviction\nthat \"there are no facts in this case of persuasion or force. Defendant appeared while\nS.C. was sleeping. He initiated the sexual act while she slept. Defendant's actions\ncaused her to awaken. There was no evidence of forcible compulsion, as §\n556.061(12) defines that term, before or after S.C. awoke.\" Niederstadt I, 2001 WL\n995937, at *3. Significantly, one member of the panel, after concurring in the state\ncourt of appeals's unanimous opinion, wrote separately to express his \"chagrin\" that\nthe reversal resulted from the prosecutor's decision to pursue this charge: \"Why the\nprosecutor chose to undertake the burden of proving forcible compulsion – an\nimpossible task on the evidence here – defies explanation.\" Id. at *4 (Shrum, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n      I recognize that the method of the common law will cause legal principles to\nmigrate and expand somewhat as words and principles encounter new facts. But in\nthe present case the Missouri Supreme Court's application of the sodomy statute\nrepresented not the gradual evolution of a principle but a quantum leap that essentially\nredefined a statutory crime.\n\n       I recognize, too, that it is the sole province of the Missouri courts to construe\ntheir own statutes and that such constructions as those courts may give them are\nauthoritative and binding on federal courts. We have no appellate jurisdiction over\nstate courts and would not presume to venture an opinion that the interpretation that\n\n                                          -22-\n\fthe Missouri Supreme Court gave the statute relevant to this case was incorrect as a\nmatter of Missouri law: Indeed, it was correct by definition. The Missouri Supreme\nCourt's interpretation of the statute would remain intact, unaffected by a ruling in\nfavor of the Mr. Niederstadt, and the courts of Missouri would be free to apply that\ninterpretation to any conduct that occurs after the Missouri Supreme Court's ruling in\nMr. Niederstadt's appeal. I would hold only that in applying its construction to\nMr. Niederstadt, the Missouri Supreme Court violated his right to due process.\n\n       Mr. Niederstadt's crime was grievous. Perhaps in some abstract moral sense he\ngot what he deserved. But we are here to do law, not enforce morals, and\nMr. Niederstadt's sentence was at least eighteen years longer than it would otherwise\nhave been because of the construction that the Missouri Supreme Court gave to the\nphrase \"forcible compulsion.\" In any event, Mr. Niederstadt did not get part of what\nhe deserved, namely the due process of law that the Constitution secures for persons\naccused of crime. The maxim nulla poena sine lege, no punishment without a statute,\nis not a modern innovation intended to maximize the number of miscreants who go\nunpunished. It is a cherished principle of Anglo-American law, and ought not to be\nlightly shoved aside.\n\n      I would affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f",

We granted the\nState's petition for rehearing en banc and now reverse.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      We quote the Supreme Court of Missouri's undisputed recitation of the\nbackground facts, 66 S.W.2d at 14:\n\n            The victim, S.C., was a sixteen-year-old female at the time of the\n      alleged sodomy in 1992. She was the daughter of American missionaries\n      serving in Gambia, West Africa. In 1991, S.C. was sent by her parents\n      to Malden, Missouri, to attend high school and to live with defendant and\n      his family. Prior to coming to defendant's home, she had no sexual\n      experience. In July and August of 1991, defendant began engaging in\n      inappropriate kissing on the lips and fondling of the girl's breasts and\n      touching her between her legs.\n\n             At the religious school she attended, she began getting into\n      trouble. The school administered detention as punishment. Defendant's\n      punishment was to administer whippings to the girl's buttocks, back, and\n      legs. He contended the girl was \"rebellious and needed it.\" The beatings\n      were so severe that S.C. suffered bruising, making it painful for her to\n      walk and difficult for her to participate in physical education classes.\n      The beatings occurred about once per month during her stay in the\n      Niederstadt home. Sometimes on the morning after a beating, the\n      defendant would come into S.C.'s room, take off her clothes and\n      underwear, and count her bruises out loud. Following one such beating,\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      defendant attempted to strangle S.C., squeezing her neck and repeatedly\n      saying, \"I could kill you right now.\" He eventually released her.\n      Because of the beatings and threats, on one occasion S.C. attempted to\n      run away from the defendant's home but returned the same day. S.C.\n      stated that she was afraid to report the sexual misconduct to authorities.\n\n            Like the beatings, the fondling incidents continued throughout the\n      school year, usually occurring in the early morning. Defendant would\n      come into the girl's room and place his hand under her clothes and\n      underwear. While he touched her, he would masturbate.\n\n             The information alleged that the [sodomy] occurred in March of\n      1992. The victim testified to several such incidents but only gave details\n      as to one in March of 1992. S.C. testified that she had been feeling sick\n      and went to sleep in her room. She was awakened by a sharp pain which\n      she discovered was caused by defendant's finger in her vagina. When\n      she awoke, defendant told S.C. he was \"checking [her] temperature.\"\n      Defendant admitted to that incident. S.C. testified that later in March\n      there were other occasions when defendant penetrated her vagina with\n      his finger.\n\n      Niederstadt was charged with sodomy in violation of § 566.060(1). The statute\nprohibited “deviate sexual intercourse with another person without that person’s\nconsent by the use of forcible compulsion.” It is conceded that Niederstadt's digital\npenetration constituted “deviate sexual intercourse” as defined in § 566.010(1). As\nrelevant here, \"forcible compulsion\" was defined as “[p]hysical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” § 556.061(12)(a).\n\n       After a bench trial, the trial court denied Niederstadt's motion for judgment of\nacquittal and found him guilty of sodomy. The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed,\nconcluding that, because Niederstadt “initiated the sexual act while [the victim] slept”\nand stopped when she awakened, there was no evidence he used forcible compulsion.\nThe fact that he used forcible compulsion on other occasions, the Court reasoned, did\nnot supply the requisite proof that it was used in committing the charged offense.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fState v. Niederstadt, No. 23612, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">995937</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. July 23, 2001). A\nconcurring opinion criticized “the State's failure to analyze its evidence and file a\ncharge the evidence will support.”\n\n       The Supreme Court of Missouri granted discretionary review, concluded that\nNiederstadt's conduct constituted sodomy under Missouri law, and reinstated the\nconviction and sentence. The Court first noted there can be “no question but that\ndefendant used physical force to insert his finger in the girl’s vagina.” Niederstadt,\n66 S.W.3d at 15. The Court then discussed the “critical question” of “whether the acts\nof deviate sexual intercourse were done by use of physical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” Id. (quotation omitted). The Court looked to the coercive\nbeatings, threats, and sexual indecencies the forty-year-old Niederstadt had previously\ninflicted on a sixteen-year-old girl who was living in his home. The Court concluded\nthat Niederstadt’s conduct and his “complete control and dominance over every aspect\nof the girl’s life” provided sufficient evidence for the court to find that he used\nphysical force that overcame “[t]he reasonable resistance expected of an unconscious\nor sleeping person.” Id. at 16. Niederstadt moved for rehearing, raising as a due\nprocess issue that the Court had “unforeseeably expanded the scope of conduct that\nmight be prosecuted under § 566.060.” The Supreme Court of Missouri summarily\ndenied that motion. Niederstadt then timely filed this petition for federal habeas relief.\n\n                                           II.\n\n        The State first argues that Niederstadt’s due process claim is procedurally\nbarred. Federal habeas relief may not be granted on a claim that the state appellate\ncourt declined to address because the petitioner failed to meet a state procedural\nrequirement constituting an “independent and adequate state ground.” Coleman v.\nThompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 (1991).

The State\nargues that Niederstadt defaulted his due process claim because it was first raised in\nhis motion for rehearing to the Supreme Court of Missouri. The State explains that,\nbecause its brief to that Court urged the interpretation of the sodomy statute the Court\nultimately adopted, Niederstadt had both notice and opportunity to raise a due process\nobjection in his responsive brief, before the Court ruled.\n\n       After careful review of the record, we conclude this issue was not properly\npreserved and presented by the State. The record on appeal does not reveal whether\nthe State argued procedural default to the Supreme Court of Missouri in opposing\nNiederstadt's motion for rehearing. The Court's summary denial of rehearing is\ncustomary and gives no indication that the Court was invoking a procedural bar,\nparticularly if the State did not argue that the due process issue was defaulted. In\nthese circumstances, we infer the state court denied this issue on the merits, not on an\nindependent and adequate procedural ground. See Muth v. Frank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790739\"><a href=\"/opinion/790739/allen-a-muth-v-matthew-j-frank-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 815-\n16 (7th Cir.)

Moreover, the State\ncites only the readily distinguishable Wickizer case, which does not begin to establish\nthat the state court would have been applying a “firmly established and regularly\nfollowed” principle if it had ruled the due process claim procedurally defaulted on the\nunusual procedural facts of this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f                                           III.\n\n       Turning to the merits of Niederstadt's due process claim, in Bouie the state\nsupreme court construed a statute, which on its face limited criminal trespass to\nwrongful entries, as including the refusal by peaceful civil rights demonstrators to\nobey a proprietor's order to leave a racially segregated restaurant otherwise open to\nthe public. The Court held that this retroactive judicial expansion of the statute's\ncriminal prohibition violated the defendants' due process rights. As later clarified,\nBouie's due process restriction on judicial interpretation of criminal statutes is limited\nto those “that are 'unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been\nexpressed prior to the conduct in issue.'” Rogers v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118425\"><a href=\"/opinion/118425/rogers-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461\n(2001), quoting Bouie, 378 U.S. at 354. Unlike judicial review of retroactive\nlegislation under the broader Ex Post Facto Clause, review of a court's application of\na criminal statute to a particular defendant, which by its nature is retroactive, “rest[s]\non core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to\nfair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal\npenalties to what previously had been innocent conduct.” Rogers, 532 U.S. at 459.\n\n       Niederstadt argues the Missouri Supreme Court’s determination that he used\nforcible compulsion sufficient to violate the sodomy statute violated his right to due\nprocess because, contrary to prior reported decisions, the Court ruled that the forcible\ncoercion element is satisfied by the force inherent in a sex offense committed on a\nsleeping victim, who cannot resist. This ruling was “unexpected and indefensible,”\nhe argues, because it rendered the forcible coercion element surplusage, eliminated the\nstatutory requirement that the defendant “use” forcible coercion, and impermissibly\nequated sodomy with lesser uncharged sex crimes that did not require proof of forcible\ncoercion. The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded that its interpretation of the\nsodomy statute did not conflict with the narrow due process restriction of Bouie and\nRogers. The task of a federal habeas court is to determine whether that conclusion\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fwas an “unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby the Supreme Court.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n      1. At the time Niederstadt committed the offense, the Supreme Court of\nMissouri had not construed the term “forcible compulsion” in § 566.010, nor the\nterm's statutory definition in § 556.061(12)(a), “[p]hysical force that overcomes\nreasonable resistance.” The Missouri Court of Appeals had construed these statutes\nin a number of cases. In only one prior case had that Court reversed a Missouri\nsodomy conviction because the evidence failed to establish use of forcible\ncompulsion. State v. Daleske, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2378911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2378911/state-v-daleske/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. 1993). In reinstating\nNiederstadt's conviction, the Supreme Court of Missouri carefully considered the\nCourt of Appeals decision in Daleske and found it “readily distinguishable” because\nthe defendant in Daleske employed only de minimis force and threats, whereas here\nthe victim “was awakened by a sharp pain which she discovered was caused by\ndefendant’s finger in her vagina” and suffered other “beatings, physical threats [and]\nsexual assaults.” Niederstadt, 66 S.W.3d at 16, 14.1\n\n        In Rogers, a divided Court refused to extend Bouie to a state court decision\noverruling a common law rule that would have barred petitioner’s conviction. Like\nBouie, this case involves a state court decision construing a criminal statute. Thus,\nit is instructive to consider how the dissenting Justices in Rogers -- those who would\nhave extended Bouie -- would apply Bouie in this type of case:\n\n\n      1\n        We disagree with Niederstadt's assertion that the Supreme Court of Missouri’s\ndecision collapsed the distinct offenses of sodomy and deviate sexual assault, defined\nin § 566.070(1) as deviate sexual intercourse without the victim's consent. By\ndistinguishing Daleske as involving only de minimis force and threats, the Court\npreserved a distinction between the offenses. 66 S.W.3d at 16. Moreover, as there is\nno Double Jeopardy Clause concern, we fail to see why such a collapse would violate\ndue process so long as it was not an “unexpected and indefensible” interpretation of\nstate law. As we shall explain, this interpretation was neither.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      Many criminal cases present some factual nuance that arguably\n      distinguishes them from cases that have come before; a court applying\n      the penal statute to the new fact pattern does not purport to change the\n      law. That, however, is not the action before us here, but rather, a square,\n      head-on overruling of prior law . . . .\n\n532 U.S. at 471 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In this case, the Supreme Court of Missouri\ndid not overrule prior law, it applied the governing statute to a new fact pattern,\nengaging in the type of fact-based analysis described in Justice Scalia’s dissent.\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court of Missouri had not previously considered the statute,\nthere was no prior governing law to overrule. As we said in Hagan v. Caspari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692015\"><a href=\"/opinion/692015/donald-r-hagan-v-paul-d-caspari-donald-r-hagan-v-paul-d-caspari/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547 (8th Cir. 1995), \"until the state's highest court has spoken on a particular\npoint of state law, the law of the state necessarily must be regarded as unsettled.\" A\nruling on an unsettled issue of state law will rarely if ever be unexpected and\nindefensible.\n\n       2. Niederstadt argues that the Supreme Court of Missouri's construction of “use\nof forcible compulsion” reconfigured the sodomy statute in a totally unexpected way\nby eliminating the State's need to prove the defendant used force over and above the\nsex act itself to overcome the victim's reasonable resistance. But this argument\nignores over one hundred years of Missouri criminal statutes and judicial decisions.\nIn State v. Welch, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. 1905), the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed\nthe rape conviction of a man who penetrated a sleeping victim and continued the\nassault when she awakened. The penal code then defined rape as “forcibly ravishing\nany woman” who had reached the age of fourteen. The Court explained:\n\n      To ravish a woman is to have carnal connection with her forcibly, and\n      without her consent . . . . The general, if not universal, rule is that, if a\n      man have connection with a woman while she is asleep, he is guilty of\n      rape, because the act is without her consent.\n\n                                  *    *   *     *   *\n\n                                           -8-\n\f      [The victim] knew nothing about the assault . . . until she awoke . . . at\n      which time the penetration had already been made and the offense\n      completed. After that no submission or consent of the prosecutrix could\n      avail the defendant.\n\n                                   *   *    *    *    *\n\n      [T]he crime is not mitigated by the fact that it was committed while the\n      prosecutrix was asleep.\n\n89 S.W. at 947-48. In other words, the court equated unconsented penetration of a\nsleeping woman with forcible rape.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Missouri expanded the rule of Welch in State v. Atkins,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. 1926), affirming the rape conviction of a physician who while\nexamining a patient penetrated her by surprise and stopped when she protested. The\nCourt explained:\n\n      It is plain that, if appellant did penetrate prosecutrix sexually . . . no more\n      physical force was employed by him than is necessarily incident to such\n      an act when done with the consent of the woman. . . . One phase of the\n      contention concerning the insufficiency of the evidence is that . . . the\n      alleged act of ravishment was not forcible within the meaning of [the\n      statute]. . . . But the law has been otherwise declared in this state.\n\n                                   *   *    *    *    *\n\n      If it is rape under our statutes for a man to have illicit sexual connection\n      with a woman while she is asleep, and incapable of consenting . . . we\n      are unable to see why it is not also rape for a man to have improper\n      sexual connection with a woman by accomplishing penetration through\n      surprise . . . . In all cases of that sort the physical force merely to effect\n      penetration without the employment of further force to overcome\n      resistance, together with the want of consent, should, and, under the rule\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f      announced in the Welch Case, does, constitute force within the meaning\n      of our statute defining and punishing rape.\n\n292 S.W. at 425-26 (emphasis added).\n\n      Welch and Atkins were rape cases, not sodomy cases. In 1979, the Missouri\nLegislature revised the statutes governing both rape and sodomy. The rape statute was\namended to change the “ravishing” language to “use of forcible compulsion.” Mo.\nRev. Stat. § 566.030(1). But the Comment to that subsection advised that it\n“continues the common law concept of forcible rape -- intercourse by 'forcible\ncompulsion'.” At the same time, the sodomy statute, which had previously defined the\ncrime without regard to force or lack of consent, was amended in § 566.060(1) to\ninclude the same “use of forcible compulsion” language adopted to define rape. The\nComment to this statute advised, “The provisions of this section correspond with the\nrape provisions of § 566.030.”\n\n       This historical review makes crystal clear what common sense teaches -- it was\nneither unexpected nor indefensible for the Supreme Court of Missouri to construe the\nMissouri rape and sodomy statutes in effect when Niederstadt committed his offense\nas applying to the unconsented penetration of a sleeping woman, just as the Court had\napplied prior rape statutes for a century, consistent with “[t]he general, if not\nuniversal, rule.” Nor is there reason to infer that 1979 legislative amendments\ndescribed as continuing the historic concept of forcible rape, and applying that\nconcept to the crime of sodomy, were intended to overrule this longstanding judicial\ninterpretation.2 Thus, Niederstadt had the fair notice due process requires that his\n\n\n      2\n        In language since repealed, the 1979 version of § 566.070.1 made “deviate\nsexual intercourse with another person . . . who is incapacitated” a class C felony\npunishable less severely than sodomy. A definitional provision, § 566.020.1, clarified\nthat “incapacity” in this context did not include sleeping. Moreover, if unclear, the\nSupreme Court of Missouri's resolution of that question would not violate Bouie.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdespicable sexual abuse of a sleeping teenage victim would be punished in this\nfashion. As Bouie requires no more, the Supreme Court of Missouri's denial of\nNiederstadt's due process claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law and must be upheld under our deferential standard of review.\n\n       The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with\ninstructions to deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge, with whom GRUENDER, Circuit Judge, joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n\n       I conclude that James Niederstadt’s due process claim was procedurally\ndefaulted in the Missouri courts, and that he is barred from pursuing it in this federal\nhabeas corpus proceeding.

Whether or not Niederstadt was required to raise his\ndue process claim in the trial court, he had an adequate opportunity to present the\nclaim to the Supreme Court of Missouri after that court accepted transfer of the case\nfrom the Missouri Court of Appeals. The trial court had entered a judgment that\nNiederstadt violated § 566.060(1) of the Missouri Revised Statutes. Two alternative\narguments were available to Niederstadt on appeal: (1) as a matter of Missouri law,\nthe trial court erred in concluding that the statute encompassed his conduct, and (2)\nif the trial court’s conclusion that the statute did reach his conduct was correct as a\nmatter of state law, then the result was so unexpected and indefensible as to violate\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Niederstadt cites no appeal in which the Supreme Court of\nMissouri has considered the merits of a claim raised for the first time in a motion for\nrehearing. Nothing in the court’s summary denial of Niederstadt’s motion suggests\nthat the decision “rest[ed] primarily on federal law” or was “interwoven with the\nfederal law.” See Coleman v.

The natural\ninference from the summary order – particularly given that it was entered without\nseeking an opposing brief on Niederstadt’s new constitutional claim – is that the court\n\n                                         -12-\n\fdid not depart from its longstanding refusal to consider new issues on rehearing.

Therefore,\nreview of the federal claim is barred in this proceeding unless Niederstadt shows cause\nfor the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged constitutional violation,\nor demonstrates that failure to consider the claim will result in a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750. Niederstadt does not argue “cause”\nand “prejudice,” but the district court thought the claim should be considered, even\nassuming a procedural default, under the miscarriage of justice or “actual innocence”\nexception to procedural default. Rejecting the recommendation of a magistrate judge\nthat the claim was procedurally barred, the district court reasoned that Niederstadt has\nproduced “clear and convincing evidence that, absent the supreme court’s unlawful\nbroadening of the forcible sodomy statute, no reasonable court would have found\n[him] guilty of the crime under existing facts.” Niederstadt v. Purkett, No.\n\n\n      3\n        The court’s alternative suggestion, ante, at 5, that the State has failed to show\nthat the Supreme Court of Missouri relied on a procedural rule that is “firmly\nestablished and regularly followed” presumably is dictum, for resolution of the default\nquestion on that basis would be inconsistent with the court’s conclusion that\nNiederstadt’s constitutional claim should be reviewed under the deferential standard\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). If the state court purported to rely on a procedural ground in\nrejecting the federal constitutional claim, but that ground is later deemed inadequate\nto bar federal habeas review, then the federal claim was not adjudicated on the merits\nby the state court, see Brown v.

After deciding that the state of Missouri had not properly preserved the issue\nof procedural default in state court, the court simply states that \"[t]he task of a federal\nhabeas court is to determine whether [a state court's] conclusion was an 'unreasonable\napplication of ... clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt.' \" But that standard applies only if Mr. Niederstadt's claim was \"adjudicated\non the merits in state court.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n      The court, in discussing the question of procedural default, relies on Muth v.\nFrank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790739\"><a href=\"/opinion/790739/allen-a-muth-v-matthew-j-frank-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), for the\nproposition that if a state court denies a claim summarily we should presume that it\ndecided it on the merits.

Brown v. Luebbers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786524\"><a href=\"/opinion/786524/vernon-brown-v-allen-d-luebbers/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460-61 (8th\nCir. 2004) (en banc), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). Indeed, in that case, both\nthe court's and the dissenting opinion discussed at length the question of whether the\nstate court had reached petitioner's federal claim or had decided only the state claim\nthat was based on the same factual predicate. Because of all the labor devoted to that\nquestion, it is plain that both opinions in Brown proceeded on the assumption that if\nthe state court exhibited no apparent awareness of the federal claim or gave no hint\nthat it had considered it, we could not conclude that it had been adjudicated on the\nmerits. And more recently we conducted a detailed examination of a state court\nopinion before determining that it resolved a particular claim on the merits. Weaver\nv. Bowersox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793396\"><a href=\"/opinion/793396/william-weaver-appelleecross-appellant-v-michael-bowersox/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838-39 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\n       Thus, the premise of all of our previous relevant cases seems to be that when\na state court has said nothing with respect to a federal claim, we can have no basis for\nconcluding that it had adjudicated it. It therefore comes as a surprise to learn that we\nnow have a binary approach to such matters: If a claim was dismissed for something\n\n                                         -16-\n\fother than a procedural default, it must necessarily have been adjudicated on the\nmerits. Perhaps there is some justification for this rule, but the court offers none, and\nin the process overrules sub silentio a number of our cases that are inconsistent with\nany such principle. Or maybe our previous cases can be distinguished on the ground\nthat in them the state court did discuss some claims and thus it might reasonably be\ninferred that the state court simply overlooked some claim or claims that went\nunmentioned. But the court here does not make that distinction, and I would not be\ninclined to make it either, for reasons that I allude to later.\n\n       It might also be argued that we ought not to presume that a state court has not\nconsidered a claim just because it did not mention it. After all, it often happens that\nappellate courts fail to discuss assignments of error without mentioning them directly,\nbut the court's judgment presumably concludes them nevertheless. But this kind of\nreasoning probably makes less sense when, as here, the state and federal claims are\nbased on the same factual predicate, and the court does not advance this argument in\ndefense of its ruling.\n\n       I think, moreover, that the principle apparently adhered to in our previous cases\nhas a better claim to recognition than the one that the court adopts. First of all, one\napparent purpose of AEDPA is to promote comity and to provide a certain amount of\ndeference to the place of state courts in our overall federal system. The statute was\nintended to increase respect for state court judgments: It is therefore the states'\ninterests that are at stake here, and they should be alert to their vindication. I see no\nreason to encourage state courts to be laconic. Nor do I believe that it burdens a state\ncourt significantly to require it to devise an order that will allow a federal court to\ndiscern whether the state court has adjudicated a federal claim. The statute, moreover,\ndoes not by its own terms apply unless the federal claim has been adjudicated; and if\nthe relevant state court order is opaque with respect to whether it decides a matter, the\ncondition in the statute is not satisfied. To put it another way, if a state wants to claim\nthe shelter that the statute provides, it has the burden to show that it is entitled to it.\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       It is important to appreciate that in passing AEDPA Congress meant only to\nlimit a state prisoner's right to an unrestricted review of a habeas claim, not to\neliminate it. By requiring that a claim be adjudicated on the merits in state court\nbefore the review by a federal court would be restricted, I believe that Congress made\nclear that a habeas petitioner must receive an unrestricted, i.e., de novo, review of his\nor her constitutional claims by either a state or federal court. We therefore correctly\nconducted an intensive review in our previous cases to determine whether the state\ncourt in fact had decided the federal claim at issue. When forced to choose between\npossibly depriving a habeas petitioner of unrestricted review by any court and\nrequiring a state court simply to say that it conducted such a review, I think that\nCongress's intent compels us to choose the latter.\n\n      I would therefore review Mr. Niederstadt's claim de novo.\n\n                                          II.\n       Even assuming for the sake of argument that the due process claim here was\nadjudicated on the merits and AEDPA therefore applies, I believe that Mr. Niederstadt\nwould be entitled to habeas relief. In those cases in which the state court decides an\nissue but provides no explanation, we \"conduct an independent review of the record\nand applicable law to determine whether state court decision is contrary to federal law\n[or] unreasonably applies clearly established law.\" Harris v.

Thus the due\nprocess clause is violated when a court gives retroactive effect to \"a judicial\nconstruction of a criminal statute [that] is 'unexpected and indefensible by reference\nto the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' \" Bouie, 378 U.S.\nat 354 (quoting Jerome Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960));\nsee also Rogers, 532 U.S. at 461.\n\n      The Missouri sodomy statute, at the time of Mr. Niederstadt's conduct,\nprohibited \"deviate sexual intercourse with another person without that person's\nconsent by the use of forcible compulsion.\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.060.1 (Supp. 1991).\nDeviate sexual intercourse included \"any sexual act involving the genitals of one\nperson and the mouth, tongue, hand, or anus of another person.\" Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 566.010(1) (Supp. 1991). Forcible compulsion was defined as \"physical force that\novercomes reasonable resistance\" or \"a threat, express or implied, that places a person\nin reasonable fear of death, serious physical injury, or kidnapping of himself or\nanother person.\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 556.061(12) (Supp. 1991).\n\n       Mr. Niederstadt admits that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict\nhim of deviate sexual assault in the first degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.070(1) (1986),\nwhich applied when the victim was an incapacitated person, or deviate sexual assault\nin the second degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.080(1) (1986), which applied to an assault\nof a sixteen-year-old victim by a person seventeen years or older. Neither of these\ncrimes included the element of forcible compulsion. Mr. Niederstadt argues that he\ndid not use forcible compulsion to accomplish the act, and that the Missouri Supreme\nCourt's construction of § 556.061(12)(a) to include his conduct diverged so widely\nfrom the law as it existed at the time of his offense as to violate his due process rights.\n\n       The Missouri Supreme Court held that Mr. Niederstadt used physical force\nagainst S.C., a minor dependent on him for care, in such a manner that her reasonable\nresistance to his sexual assaults was greatly reduced and then sodomized her while she\n\n                                           -19-\n\fslept. The act of penetrating S.C.'s vagina itself required force to be applied to her\nbody, the court noted, and it held that that satisfied the physical force element of the\nstatute. Niederstadt II, 66 S.W.3d at 14-16.\n\n       Under Bouie, we must determine what law \"had been expressed prior to the\nconduct in issue.\" We first examine the statutory language: The statute, after all, is\nthe primary expression of the law applicable to this case. Section 566.060 required\nthat the \"deviate sexual intercourse\" be accomplished \"by the use of forcible\ncompulsion\" (emphasis added); it does not give notice that the intercourse itself can\nbe the force used to accomplish the intercourse or that a sleeping or unconscious\nvictim can be \"compelled.\" Under § 556.061(12), \"forcible compulsion\" is defined\nas \"physical force that overcomes reasonable resistance,\" but this definition does\nnothing to bring Mr. Niederstadt's conduct within the scope of § 566.060: It provides\nno notice that \"physical force\" can be the intercourse itself or that the victim (whose\n\"reasonable resistance\" is overcome) may be asleep. Therefore we do not believe that\nthe statutory language provided \"fair warning\" that Mr. Niederstadt's conduct came\nwithin the terms of the crime with which he was charged.\n\n       Case law also plainly failed to provide the notice that due process requires. No\nMissouri case before Mr. Niederstadt's holds or implies that the force necessary for\nforcible compulsion is equivalent to the performance of the sexual act which the\nstatute states the forcible compulsion is used to accomplish. Nor had any case held\nor implied that a defendant could be convicted under § 566.060 when the victim was\nasleep and unaware of the acts alleged to be \"forcible compulsion.\" For example, in\nState v. R_ D_ G_, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2450198\"><a href=\"/opinion/2450198/state-v-r-d-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987), the court's discussion\nof force focused on the defendant's grabbing and holding the victim's arms and\ndragging her into a bedroom. Here S.C. testified that she was not even aware that\nMr. Niederstadt was in the room until she awoke and, according to the Missouri\nSupreme Court, the deviate sexual intercourse had already been accomplished \"by the\nuse of forcible compulsion,\" Mo. Rev. Stat. 566.060.\n\n                                         -20-\n\f       In holding that the force used to penetrate S.C.'s vagina could fulfill the element\nof forcible compulsion, the Missouri Supreme Court reconfigured the sodomy statutes\nin an unexpected way. Under this construction, the element of \"forcible compulsion\"\ncollapses into the element of \"deviate sexual intercourse,\" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 566.060.1\n(Supp. 1991), and sodomy, when committed against a victim from whom virtually no\nreasonable resistance is expected, such as the sleeping victim here, becomes\nindistinguishable from the offense of deviate sexual intercourse in the second degree,\nwhich did not require proof of forcible compulsion. At the time of Mr. Niederstadt's\nconduct, neither the plain language of the sodomy statute nor the case law supported\nsuch a construction. Where, as here, a court construes a criminal statute in a new way\nthat removes an entire element from it, it violates the principle of fair warning that\nunderlies the constitutional right to due process if, in the same case, the court uses that\nnew statutory interpretation to uphold the defendant's conviction.\n\n       As often happens, the state makes arguments and relies on authorities in its\npresentation to the en banc court that it never made to the district court or to the panel\nof our court that heard the case originally. The fact that this tack is late-blooming is\nevidence enough that the state did not originally regard these authorities as relevant,\nand rightly so. The court nevertheless adopts the state's new arguments when it holds,\nante at 8-10, that some old cases dealing with rape are helpful here. See State v.\nWelch, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. 1905); State v. Atkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. 1926). But those\ncases are inapposite because they do not deal with a calibrated statutory scheme that\ndeliberately distinguishes forcible sexual acts from acts that are committed on the\nincapacitated, including, presumably, the insensate.\n\n       The court also maintains, ante at 7 n.1, that the Missouri Supreme Court\npreserved the distinction between the two offenses at issue here, but in fact the state\ncourt's attempt to distinguish State v. Daleske, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2378911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2378911/state-v-daleske/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mo. App. 1993), was\nat best startling and at worst entirely fanciful. The court also remarks, ante at 7 n.1,\nthat collapsing the two offenses would not be unconstitutional unless it was\n\n                                           -21-\n\funexpected and indefensible. But surely the court does not mean to say that it expects\nstate courts to collapse statutes or that it would defend state courts that did so.\n\n       I would therefore conclude that the Missouri Supreme Court's decision was an\nunreasonable interpretation of United States Supreme Court due-process jurisprudence\nin Bouie and other cases because I believe that it is quite obvious that neither the plain\nlanguage of the statute nor state case law at the time of Mr. Niederstadt's conduct\ndefined \"forcible compulsion\" as encompassing his conduct. I agree with the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals, which stated in its opinion reversing Mr. Niederstadt's conviction\nthat \"there are no facts in this case of persuasion or force. Defendant appeared while\nS.C. was sleeping. He initiated the sexual act while she slept. Defendant's actions\ncaused her to awaken. There was no evidence of forcible compulsion, as §\n556.061(12) defines that term, before or after S.C. awoke.\" Niederstadt I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">995937</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. Significantly, one member of the panel, after concurring in the state\ncourt of appeals's unanimous opinion, wrote separately to express his \"chagrin\" that\nthe reversal resulted from the prosecutor's decision to pursue this charge: \"Why the\nprosecutor chose to undertake the burden of proving forcible compulsion – an\nimpossible task on the evidence here – defies explanation.\" Id. at *4 (Shrum, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n      I recognize that the method of the common law will cause legal principles to\nmigrate and expand somewhat as words and principles encounter new facts. But in\nthe present case the Missouri Supreme Court's application of the sodomy statute\nrepresented not the gradual evolution of a principle but a quantum leap that essentially\nredefined a statutory crime.\n\n       I recognize, too, that it is the sole province of the Missouri courts to construe\ntheir own statutes and that such constructions as those courts may give them are\nauthoritative and binding on federal courts. We have no appellate jurisdiction over\nstate courts and would not presume to venture an opinion that the interpretation that\n\n                                          -22-\n\fthe Missouri Supreme Court gave the statute relevant to this case was incorrect as a\nmatter of Missouri law: Indeed, it was correct by definition. The Missouri Supreme\nCourt's interpretation of the statute would remain intact, unaffected by a ruling in\nfavor of the Mr. Niederstadt, and the courts of Missouri would be free to apply that\ninterpretation to any conduct that occurs after the Missouri Supreme Court's ruling in\nMr. Niederstadt's appeal. I would hold only that in applying its construction to\nMr. Niederstadt, the Missouri Supreme Court violated his right to due process.\n\n       Mr. Niederstadt's crime was grievous. Perhaps in some abstract moral sense he\ngot what he deserved. But we are here to do law, not enforce morals, and\nMr. Niederstadt's sentence was at least eighteen years longer than it would otherwise\nhave been because of the construction that the Missouri Supreme Court gave to the\nphrase \"forcible compulsion.\" In any event, Mr. Niederstadt did not get part of what\nhe deserved, namely the due process of law that the Constitution secures for persons\naccused of crime. The maxim nulla poena sine lege, no punishment without a statute,\nis not a modern innovation intended to maximize the number of miscreants who go\nunpunished. It is a cherished principle of Anglo-American law, and ought not to be\nlightly shoved aside.\n\n      I would affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f</pre>",
