The\n\nresponse brief of the appellee, Matthew J. Ocker, does not meaningfully confront\n\nthe body of Texas law that controls this appeal. Instead, he dwells on collateral\n\nirrelevancies concerning the correctness of the decisions of the arbitrator, and even\n\nof Judge Alcala, whose rulings are not at issue in this case.\n\n      If correctness were at issue, Eddleman would still prevail. But the only issue\n\nis whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and he clearly did not. Ocker’s\n\ndecision to ignore the settled and controlling law on that issue means that he has\n\nfailed to challenge what Eddleman’s principal brief established: that the parties’\n\nbroad agreement to arbitrate encompassed all of the disputes on which the\n\narbitrator issued an award in favor of Eddleman, so he did not exceed his\n\nauthority, and the district court reversibly erred in denying Eddleman’s motion to\n\nconfirm. This Court should correct that error.\n\n      1\n         A party normally has 20 days to file a reply brief. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.6(c).\nIn this case, after the Court set oral argument on October 15, it granted appellee’s\nmotion for an extraordinary extension of 90 days to file his response brief. It was\ndue on September 28, which was then altered to September 29. This allowed the\nappellant only 16 days to file the reply, and in reality much less, because the\nappellant would naturally want her reply filed long enough before the oral\nargument that the panel would have adequate time to review it, as the Rules\nenvision.\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      A.     The Breach of Contract Issue\n\n      One of the issues in this appeal is whether the district court erred in finding\n\nthat the arbitrator exceeded his authority by “creating an irreconcilable ambiguity”\n\n(CR 424 at ¶ D) when he found that Eddleman “failed to exchange the children ...\n\nas contemplated by the [Mediated Settlement Agreement with her ex-husband,\n\nOcker],” but also that she was the prevailing party on this breach-of-contract issue.\n\n(Id.) This alleged ambiguity was the district court’s reason for denying\n\nEddleman’s motion to confirm the award (and for granting Ocker’s motion to\n\nvacate). Ocker’s response brief fails to explain why, even if the arbitrator had\n\nrendered an ambiguous decision—and he did not—he exceeded his authority.\n\n      Nothing in Ocker’s response brief changes the fact that when Judge Alcala\n\nordered (at the hearing on June 25, 2013) the parties to return to the mediator, he\n\nheld on the record that the parties’ differences about the MSA meant that “[t]here\n\nis no agreement” (other than the agreements in ¶ 10, including to mediate/\n\narbitrate), and that “the orders ... in effect are the last orders of the Court.”2 And\n\nthere is still no dispute that the MSA required Eddleman to exchange the children\n\nin Cameron, Texas (CR 87), but that “the last orders of the Court” preceding the\n\nMSA did not. There is also no dispute that Eddleman, after the hearing on June 25,\n\n      2\n      Both parties included excerpts from the transcript of the hearing,\nEddleman at Appendix B of her brief, and Ocker at Appendix A of his brief.\n\n\n                                            2\n\f2013, complied with “the last orders of the Court,” not the MSA.\n\n      That she did not comply with the MSA after June 25 was one of Ocker’s\n\ncomplaints in the arbitration,3 but the arbitrator rejected that complaint and found\n\nin favor of Eddleman on the ground that she complied with Judge Alcala’s rulings\n\non June 25 that the MSA was not in effect (other than ¶ 10). There was nothing\n\nambiguous —and nothing that exceeded the arbitrator’s authority—in the\n\narbitrator’s finding that Eddleman prevailed on this issue even though she did not\n\nexchange the children as contemplated by the MSA, because Judge Alcala had\n\nruled that she was not required to do so.\n\n             1.    Lack of Agreement is Not an Affirmative Defense\n\n      Ocker’s response brief contends that the arbitrator should not have\n\nconsidered Eddleman’s argument that the MSA was not in effect when she did not\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. According to Ocker, that was an affirmative\n\ndefense to his claim that Eddleman breached the MSA, and she failed to plead that\n\ndefense in her answer. (Ocker Am. Br. at 10 & 458.)\n\n      On the contrary: MSAs are contracts (as Ocker himself points out: Ocker\n\n\n\n      3\n        It was one of the issues he complained about in the lawsuit he filed in the\n319th District Court (CR 7-8), so it became one of the issues that the parties\nagreed to arbitrate. (CR 246: “The arbitration is intended to resolve all currently\npending issues in the 319th District Court ... as well as all the issues currently\npending in the 13th Court of Appeals.”)\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAm. Br. at 20), of which an essential element is an agreement,4 and in this case\n\nJudge Alcala found that “[t]here is no agreement” (other than the agreements in\n\n¶ 10). When Ocker sued later in the 319th District Court for breach of the MSA\n\nwith respect to the visitation issue, an agreement was an essential element of his\n\nclaim. All Eddleman had to do was deny it, and she did so by way of a general\n\ndenial. (CR 22 at ¶ 14.) An affirmative defense, on the other hand, “does not seek\n\nto defend by merely denying the plaintiff’s claims, but rather seeks to establish an\n\nindependent reason why the plaintiff should not recover.” Texas Beef Cattle Co. v.\n\nGreen, 921 S.W.2d 203, 212 (Tex. 1996). Eddleman’s general denial of an\n\nagreement was not independent of Ocker’s contention that there was an\n\nagreement: it was merely a denial of his contention, so it was not an affirmative\n\ndefense that required specific pleading.\n\n             2.    Judge Alcala’s Decision is Not at Issue\n\n      Ocker also wastes ink questioning whether Judge Alcala, in June 2013,\n\nreleased the parties from compliance with the MSA on the ground that “[t]here is\n\nno agreement” (other than ¶ 10). Ocker’s response brief describes this as “an\n\nalleged order” (Ocker Am. Br. at 10), “a phantom Order” (id. at 47), and “clearly\n\n\n\n      4\n       T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex.\n1992) (“[t]he material terms of the contract must be agreed upon before a court can\nenforce the contract”).\n\n\n                                           4\n\fcontrary” to the written order that eventually issued (id. at 10.) That is sheer\n\nnonsense: Judge Alcala was quite clear on the record of the hearing:\n\n      THE COURT: Okay, so the orders are in effect are the last orders of\n      the Court, correct?\n\n      MS. KNAUPP [counsel for Eddleman]: Correct. That are what’s in\n      effect.\n\n      MR. KELLY [counsel for Ocker]: Your Honor, the [MSA]\n      contemplates the agreement of the parties is now in effect.\n\n      THE COURT: No. There’s no agreement, right? There is no\n      agreement by your own words so —\n\n      MR. KELLY: There are disputes, but there is an agreement.\n\n      THE COURT: No. No. There is no agreement. If there are disputes,\n      there’s no agreement. We’re not going to take it that far.\n\n(Eddleman Br., App’x B, Reporter’s Record, Motion Hearing of June 25, 2013, at\n\n29-30.) There is nothing “phantom” about what Judge Alcala said on the record.\n\n      Therefore, Ocker compares what Judge Alcala said on the record with the\n\ncontent of the order he issued on July 10, 2013:5 in Ocker’s view, the fact that the\n\norder says nothing about the status of the MSA is dispositive. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at\n\n13-14 & 43-44.) In so arguing, Ocker loses sight of the motions that Judge Alcala\n\n\n\n      5\n        This order, attached as Appendix C to Ocker’s amended brief, is not part\nof the appellate record of the case, but Eddleman does not dispute that it is an\naccurate copy of Judge Alcala’s order. Eddleman takes no position on whether this\nCourt should take judicial notice of the order.\n\n\n                                           5\n\fhad before him: (1) Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as written, and (2)\n\nOcker’s motion to go back to mediating/arbitrating the content of the MSA.6 Judge\n\nAlcala abated Eddleman’s motion and granted Ocker’s.7 The combined effect of\n\nthese rulings, as well as Judge Alcala’s comments at the hearing on June 25, was\n\nto make clear to anyone paying attention to the case that the MSA was no longer\n\nin effect (other than ¶ 10). That was certainly the message that the arbitrator got:\n\nas he stated in the arbitral award, Judge Alcala “found that there was no current\n\nagreement between the parties.” (CR 305 at ¶ 7.) In drawing that conclusion, the\n\narbitrator in no way exceeded his authority to decide whether Eddleman breached\n\nthe MSA.\n\n      So Ocker retreats to his third alternative position: if Judge Alcala did indeed\n\nrule that there was no enforceable MSA (other than ¶ 10), then he erred in doing\n\nso. (Ocker Am. Br. at 43: “[T]o the extent there is an Order purporting to excuse\n\n\n\n      6\n         Also at issue were Eddleman’s and Ocker’s motions for fees and costs (see\nOcker Am. Br. at Appendix C). Judge Alcala’s denial of Eddleman’s motion is not\nat issue in this appeal, and his abatement of Ocker’s motion is only relevant to the\nnext issue discussed in this reply.\n      7\n        Ocker’s Brief evidences some confusion on this point. It states that Judge\nAlcala “abated his ruling on the pending motions,” which implies that Judge\nAlcala ruled, and then abated his rulings. Rather, the text of the order makes clear\nthat Judge Alcala abated Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as written, and\nOcker’s motion for fees and costs, by declining to rule on them until after the\nmediation/arbitration. (Ocker Am. Br. at Appendix C.)\n\n\n                                          6\n\fEDDLEMAN from her contractual obligations, it is a void order.”) But that is\n\nirrelevant on two levels. At the first level, the ruling by Judge Alcala is not, quite\n\nobviously, under review in this Court. In fact, instead of appealing it in the normal\n\nway, Ocker attacked it collaterally and improperly (thus drawing Eddleman’s\n\nmotion to transfer venue) by filing suit in the 319th District Court. There, he\n\nalleged that Eddleman was “ignoring ... the [MSA]” by failing to exchange the\n\nchildren in Cameron. (CR 7-8.) The only way such a claim could succeed would\n\nbe if Judge Stith disagreed with Judge Alcala that the MSA did not control.\n\n      At the second level of irrelevance, Eddleman readily acknowledges that the\n\narbitrator relied on Judge Alcala’s ruling that the MSA did not control when he\n\nrejected Ocker’s claim that she breached the MSA. The arbitrator simply accepted\n\nthe ruling as the law of the case. Whether to do so was correct as a matter of law is\n\nnot an issue that this Court has any authority to decide because, as it has already\n\nrecognized, “[j]udicial review of an arbitration award ‘is so limited that even a\n\nmistake of fact or law by the arbitrator in the application of substantive law is not\n\na proper ground for vacating an award.’” Black v. Shor, 443 S.W.3d 154, 169\n\n(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2013, pet. denied).8\n\n\n\n      8\n       Eddleman’s brief cited many other authorities for the same proposition\n(Eddleman’s Brief at 16-17), and in the interest of brevity does not repeat them all\nhere.\n\n\n                                           7\n\f      Ocker’s brief fails to address this principle of Texas law. Instead, he cites\n\ncase law to support his argument that Judge Alcala had no jurisdiction to set aside\n\nany portion of the MSA. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 42.) But reviewing the correctness of\n\nthe arbitrator’s acceptance of Judge Alcala’s action in the light of case law is\n\nprecisely the sort of mistake-of-law review that Black forbids. And it is all-the-\n\nmore contradictory for Ocker now to criticize the arbitrator for following Judge\n\nAlcala’s action given that Ocker insisted to the arbitrator that the parties’\n\narbitration agreement did not encompass any issues in the 24th District Court. (CR\n\n268.) The arbitrator agreed, and stated in his amended award that\n\n      he has no authority to comment on, critique, or in any way change any\n      Order arising out of the 24th District Court of Victoria County,\n      Texas. For purposes of this First Amended Arbitration Award, this\n      Arbitrator will simply assume that all Orders issuing out of that Court\n      are timely and valid.\n\n(CR 305; see also CR 280 at ¶ 8.) Having gotten what he wanted from the\n\narbitrator—no review of Judge Alcala’s rulings—Ocker now complains that the\n\narbitrator should not have followed the rulings. The Court should not tolerate this\n\nkind of argument.\n\n      The sole issue properly before the Court is whether the arbitrator exceeded\n\nhis authority in deciding that Eddleman did not breach the MSA when she did not\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. That depends not on whether Judge Alcala\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fruled correctly on the status of the MSA, or whether the arbitrator correctly\n\nfollowed Judge Alcala’s ruling, but on something entirely different: whether\n\naccording to “‘the language in the arbitration agreement,’” Schuster v. Wild, No.\n\n13-13-00474-CV, 2015 WL 251564, at*3 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Jan. 15,\n\n2015, pet. denied), the parties agreed to submit the breach issue to arbitration.\n\nOcker nowhere engages that issue in his brief, which is hardly surprising: it is\n\npatent on the face of this record that what the parties agreed to arbitrate included,\n\nin broad and sweeping language, with no exceptions, “all currently pending issues\n\nin the 319th District Court” (CR 246; emphasis added), and those issues included\n\nOcker’s allegation that Eddleman was “ignoring ... the [MSA]” by failing to\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. (CR 7-8.) The parties gave the arbitrator\n\nauthority to decide that issue, he decided it, and that is the end of this part of the\n\nstory. The district court should not have denied Eddleman’s motion to confirm the\n\narbitrator’s rejection of Ocker’s claim of breach of contract.\n\n      B.     The Attorney’s Fees/Costs Issue\n\n             1.     Fees/Costs in the 24th District Court, then in the 2014\n                    Appeal to this Court, then in Arbitration\n\n      At the hearing on June 25, 2013, and later in the written order issued on July\n\n10, 2013, Judge Alcala declined to rule on Ocker’s motion for fees and costs (see\n\nsupra note 7). The motion (CR 98-100) was premised on ¶ 10 of the MSA:\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      10. If one or more disputes arise with regard to the interpretation\n      and/or performance of this Agreement or any of its provisions (pre-\n      decree), including drafting disputes, pre-decree enforcement matters,\n      issues relating to omitted property or the necessity and form of\n      closing documents, the parties agree to resolve the dispute by\n      mediation with MICHAEL P. O’REILLY, the mediator, who\n      facilitated this settlement. If mediation fails, the parties agree to enter\n      into binding arbitration with MICHAEL P. O’REILLY as the\n      arbitrator and his decision on such matters shall be binding on the\n      parties, including any decision as to the allocation of the costs of the\n      arbitrator in the arbitration. If litigation is brought to construe or\n      enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\n      recover attorney’s fees, as well as court costs and expenses, including\n      the cost of the mediation/arbitration.\n\n(CR 90.) In Ocker’s view, he filed “litigation ... to construe or enforce this\n\nAgreement” when (amidst of the parties’ disputes about crafting a judicial decree\n\nthat would supersede the MSA) he opposed Eddleman’s motion to enforce the\n\nMSA as originally written, and filed his own successful motion to require\n\nmediation/arbitration of the disputes.\n\n      Ocker states repeatedly in his brief that after Judge Alcala ordered\n\nmediation/arbitration, Eddleman (or Eddleman’s counsel) refused to comply. (See,\n\ne.g., Ocker’s Am. Br. at 3, 9 & 38.) Ocker never offers any evidentiary support\n\nfrom the record for these statements, only citations to the same unsupported\n\nallegations he made in earlier pleadings. The truth (which is also outside the\n\nrecord) is that when the parties’ counsel conferred shortly after the June 25\n\nhearing to set a date for the mediation/arbitration, Ocker’s counsel stated that he\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwas completely unavailable until August 19. Counsel then discussed August 27,\n\nbut Eddleman’s counsel responded, after checking with Eddleman herself, that\n\nEddleman was not available because that day was at the beginning of the school\n\nyear for herself and other teachers in her school district. Ocker’s counsel then sued\n\nEddleman on August 26 in the 319th District Court, alleging that she was\n\nbreaching the MSA by not exchanging the children in Cameron (and by attaching\n\nvarious unreasonable conditions to mediation/arbitration under ¶ 10 of the MSA).\n\n(CR 6-8.)\n\n      Again, evidence of these efforts to set a mediation date is not in the\n\nappellate record or germane to this appeal, so it is odd that Ocker has felt the need\n\nto make unsupported accusations from outside the record blaming Eddleman for\n\nnot complying with Judge Alcala’s July 10 order. The Court must disregard them.\n\n      Despite the parties’ continuing inability to mediate/arbitrate with Michael\n\nO’Reilly pursuant to Judge Alcala’s July 10 order, they worked with Judge Alcala\n\nhimself. He was able to issue, with both parties’ assistance, an order in November\n\n2013 that, at long last, superseded the MSA. (CR 204-32.) He also addressed\n\nOcker’s motion for fees and costs, which he had declined to rule on in the July 10\n\norder, by denying the motion without explanation. (CR 232.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f      Ocker appealed the denial to this Court in 2014,9 but the parties later agreed\n\nto arbitrate “the issues currently pending in the 13th Court of Appeals” (CR 246)\n\n(along with the MSA breach allegations pending in the 319th District Court), so\n\nthis Court dismissed the appeal. Hence, the parties agreed to let the arbitrator,\n\ninstead of this Court, decide de novo the legal question of whether ¶ 10 of the\n\nMSA entitled Ocker to an award of fees and costs. The arbitrator’s amended\n\narbitration award (CR 304-08) addressed the 2014 Appeal only to state that it\n\nshould be dismissed10—he did not explicitly address the fees/costs issue, nor did\n\nhe award Ocker any fees/costs for “prevailing” on the “litigation” he had filed in\n\nthe 24th District Court, i.e., opposing Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as\n\nwritten, and filing his own motion to compel mediation/arbitration of the disputes\n\nthat had arisen when he tried to inject new issues into the MSA. However, in\n\nresponse to a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law (CR\n\n273 at ¶ 2), the arbitrator stated that he resolved nothing from the 2014 Appeal\n\nbecause “[a]t the time of the arbitration, ... there were no pending issues to be\n\n\n\n      9\n      In the Interest of H.N.O. and M.H.O., No. 13-14-00125-CV, 2014 WL\n3541803 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi July 17, 2014, no pet.) (“the 2014 Appeal”).\n      10\n         When the arbitrator rendered his original award on May 5, 2014 (CR 248-\n52), the 2014 Appeal was still pending. By the date of his amended award on\nAugust 15, 2014 (CR 304-08), this Court had already dismissed the appeal (see\nsupra note 9), but the arbitrator did not rewrite this portion of the original award.\n\n\n                                          12\n\fresolved.” (CR 279 at ¶ 2.11)\n\n                   a.     Ocker Did Not Prevail in the 2014 Appeal\n\n      Judge Stith refused to confirm the arbitrator’s denial of Ocker’s fees/costs\n\nfor the “litigation” in the 24th District Court because, in his view, Eddleman’s\n\nagreement to arbitrate the appealed issue of fees/costs meant that “the relief sought\n\nin the 13th Court of Appeals had been accomplished.” (CR 423-24 at ¶ B.)\n\nOcker’s response brief defends that view: “When EDDLEMAN, acting through\n\nher attorney, contracted to arbitrate the issues pending in the 13th Court of\n\nAppeals, the relief OCKER sought in this Appellate Court had been in part\n\nachieved ....” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 19-20.)\n\n      That is entirely false. The relief Ocker sought in the 2014 Appeal was from\n\nJudge Alcala’s order denying his motion for fees and costs. His motion had not\n\nasked Judge Alcala to refer the motion to mediation/arbitration,12 so the relief he\n\nsought in this Court could not include such a referral. Eddleman’s agreement to\n\n\n\n      11\n         Ocker filed this request under TEX. R. CIV. P. 298, which requires trial\ncourts to supply, upon request, findings and conclusions in actions tried without a\njury. The rule has no applicability to arbitration proceedings, and it is not clear\nwhy the arbitrator felt bound to reply, especially since the parties’ agreement to\narbitrate waived a record. (CR 247 at ¶ 3.)\n      12\n         The motion said only: “Movant further requests that the Court award him\nhis attorney’s fees, court costs and expenses including the cost of mediation/\narbitration.” (CR 100 at ¶ VI.)\n\n\n                                         13\n\farbitrate the fees and costs in no way handed Ocker a victory on which Judge Stith\n\ncould conclude that Ocker had prevailed in this Court.\n\n      Regardless of whether he prevailed in the 2014 Appeal when Eddleman\n\nagreed to arbitrate its issue of fees and costs, Ocker’s brief complains about the\n\narbitrator’s failure to address those fees and costs. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 16-17.) (As\n\nnoted above, the arbitrator found that there were “no pending issues to be\n\nresolved” in the 2014 Appeal (CR 279 at ¶ 2.)) That finding is the result of\n\nOcker’s too-clever-by-half maneuvering. As Ocker explained to the arbitrator in\n\nresponse to the original arbitral award, the arbitration agreement “limited your\n\njurisdiction to arbitrate issues concerning any litigation in the 13th Court of\n\nAppeals and the 319th Judicial District Court,” and did not include authority over\n\nany issues in the 24th District Court. (CR 368.) Of course, the issue in the 13th\n\nCourt of Appeals was the issue in the 24th District Court: whether ¶ 10 of the\n\nMSA entitled Ocker to an award of fees and costs. But Ocker had insisted, so the\n\narbitrator’s hands were tied, and he concluded in his amended award that\n\n      he has no authority to comment on, critique, or in any way change any\n      Order arising out of the 24th District Court of Victoria County,\n      Texas. For purposes of this First Amended Arbitration Award, this\n      Arbitrator will simply assume that all Orders issuing out of that Court\n      are timely and valid.\n\n(CR 305; see also CR 280 at ¶ 8.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f      Thus, Ocker’s insistence created the same problem as with the breach of\n\ncontract issue (see supra page 8): he insisted to the arbitrator that he could not\n\ndecide a certain issue, only to fault the arbitrator now for not deciding the issue.\n\nWhatever the Court may think of the arbitrator’s decision that “there were no\n\npending issues to be resolved” because Judge Alcala’s ruling on fees and costs\n\nwas presumed to be “valid” (CR 279 at ¶ 2), it must consider that decision in light\n\nof the dilemma Ocker created.\n\n      But what really dooms Ocker’s position is Black, 443 S.W.3d at 169\n\n(“[j]udicial review of an arbitration award ‘is so limited that even a mistake of fact\n\nor law by the arbitrator in the application of substantive law is not a proper ground\n\nfor vacating an award’”) and similar cases (see Eddleman’s Br. at 16-17) holding\n\nthat the correctness of the arbitrator’s decision is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\nIt is patent on the face of this record that the parties’ agreement to arbitrate\n\nincluded “the issues currently pending in the 13th Court of Appeals” (CR 246),\n\nand those issues included Ocker’s motion for fees and costs on the ground that he\n\n“prevail[ed]” in the “litigation” by getting the July 10 order from Judge Alcala\n\ncompelling mediation and arbitration. The arbitrator decided that the presumed\n\nvalidity of Judge Alcala’s decision—a point on which Ocker had insisted—meant\n\nthat “there were no pending issues to be resolved,” and that is the end of this part\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fof the story. The district court should not have denied Eddleman’s motion to\n\nconfirm the arbitrator’s rejection of this claim for fees and costs.\n\n                    b.    Ocker Did Not Prevail in the 319th District Court\n\n      The arbitrator also had before him Ocker’s other claim for fees and costs,\n\nwhich arose from the litigation in 319th District Court. That claim was premised\n\non the theory that he prevailed by getting Judge Stith to order mediation/\n\narbitration pursuant to ¶ 10 of the MSA, and that he prevailed against Eddleman\n\non the claim that she breached the MSA by not exchanging the children in\n\nCameron after June 25, 2013. (CR 6-7.)\n\n      The arbitrator found that Judge Alcala did not require compliance with the\n\nMSA after June 25, 2013, so naturally he did not award fees on that basis. As we\n\nhave already seen, nothing in Ocker’s response brief explains how the arbitrator\n\nexceeded his authority by following Judge Alcala; consequently, nothing in\n\nOcker’s response brief explains how the arbitrator exceeded his authority by not\n\nawarding fees/costs to Ocker on this issue. It follows that Judge Stith erred in\n\ndenying confirmation on the ground that the failure to award fee/costs to Ocker on\n\nthis issue somehow amounted to exceeding the arbitrator’s authority.\n\n      The arbitrator did not address, and implicitly denied, Ocker’s claim for fees\n\nand costs on the ground that he prevailed by getting Judge Stith’s order\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcompelling mediation/arbitration. Judge Stith, in his later order denying\n\nconfirmation, seems to have believed that getting such an order was sufficient,13\n\n(CR 424), and Ocker’s response brief defends that view:\n\n      The Arbitrator has chosen not to address ... Eddleman’s failure to\n      submit pre-decree disputes to mediation and arbitration. The\n      uncontroverted record reflects that [she] did in fact fail to comply\n      with this requirement until not one but two District Judges ordered\n      her to comply. The record reflects a strong implication that if the\n      Arbitrator had complied with his contractual obligation to consider\n      this alleged breach of contract, OCKER would have been considered\n      the prevailing party, and thus, entitled to his attorney’s fees. We will\n      not know for certain, however, until after the Arbitrator complies with\n      Judge Stith’s order vacating his arbitration ruling, directing him to re-\n      arbitrate in conformity with the Judge’s ruling.\n\n(Ocker’s Br. at 44-45.)\n\n      The argument is groundless. The parties agreed to arbitrate without a record\n\n(CR 247 at ¶ 3), so the court “must presume adequate reasoning and evidence to\n\nsupport the award” (emphasis added). SCI Texas Funeral Servs., Inc. v. Roussett,\n\nNo. 13-03-295-CV, 2005 WL 742654, at *1 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Mar. 31,\n\n2005, no pet.). See also In re Guardianship of Cantu de Villarreal, 330 S.W.3d 11,\n\n24 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2010, no pet) (“[w]hen there is no transcript of the\n\narbitration hearing, as here, the appellate court will presume the evidence was\n\n\n\n      13\n         “[T]his Court ... ordered [Eddleman] to mediate and arbitrate disputed\nissues regarding the [MSA] yet the Arbitrator did not rule on Movant [Ocker’s]\ncosts and damages as mandated by paragraph 10 of the [MSA].” (CR 424.)\n\n\n                                         17\n\fadequate to support the award”). This is necessary because, without a record, it is\n\nsimply impossible for a reviewing court to know what issues a partly actually\n\nraised during an arbitration. Hence, it is important to point out that Ocker, when he\n\nasked the arbitrator to amend the award on the ground that he exceeded his\n\nauthority, failed to mention that he believed the arbitrator had done so by not\n\nawarding fees and costs for prevailing in the 319th District Court. (CR 371.) An\n\narbitrator’s decision on an issue beyond the scope of the agreement clearly\n\nexceeds the arbitrator’s authority, but the lack of an explicit decision on an issue\n\nwithin the scope of the agreement means little, if anything.\n\n      Further, it was “adequate reasoning” for the arbitrator to construe ¶ 10 to\n\nmean that fees and costs were awardable only for prevailing on a substantive\n\ndispute about the interpretation and/or performance of the MSA, not for obtaining\n\njust an order to mediate/arbitrate a substantive dispute. Otherwise, a party who\n\nprevailed only to the extent of requiring mediation/ arbitration would be entitled to\n\nfees even if that party lost the subsequent arbitration and post-arbitral litigation: an\n\noutcome that would make no sense.\n\n      Eddleman pointed out this interpretation of ¶ 10 in her original brief\n\n(Eddleman’s Br. at 22-23), and nothing in Ocker’s response brief engages the\n\nissue. Instead, Ocker’s speculation about his chances of winning, in the above-\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fquoted passage from his brief, depends entirely upon his own interpretation of\n\nwhat it means to be a “prevailing party” under ¶ 10, without admitting the\n\npossibility of another and more reasonable interpretation. Ocker’s argument\n\ncontradicts SCI Texas and Guardianship, asking the Court to assume that the\n\narbitrator’s reasoning was not adequate for denying this claim for fees (if he\n\npressed it before the arbitrator). Since the arbitrator’s reasoning was adequate on\n\nan issue that Ocker contends was within the scope of the arbitration agreement, the\n\narbitrator clearly did not exceed his authority.\n\n      C.     The Motion to Abate or Transfer Venue\n\n      The final issue is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling on\n\nEddleman’s motion, in the 319th District Court, to transfer the venue of Ocker’s\n\naction to Victoria County. Judge Stith believed that the motion was moot, and so\n\nthe arbitrator’s ruling exceeded his authority. (CR 423 at ¶ A.) Ocker’s response\n\nbrief defends that view, arguing that “Judge Stith’s order directing the parties back\n\nto mediation and arbitration was dispositive of the Motion to Transfer Venue.”\n\n(Ocker’s Am. Br. at 33.)\n\n      That assertion is far from accurate. As Eddleman pointed out in her original\n\nbrief, after Judge Stith declined to rule on the venue motion, the arbitrator\n\ncorrectly saw that deciding it was part of his duty because, with the expectation\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fthat Judge Stith would confirm his award, he foresaw that Judge Stith would then\n\ntransfer the action to Victoria County for collection of the attorney’s fees awarded\n\nto Eddleman. That is, in fact, precisely the explanation that the arbitrator stated in\n\nhis response to Ocker’s request for additional findings and conclusions:\n\n      6.     SHERI EDDLEMAN was entitled to have the proceedings in\n             the 319th District Court abated because the case was brought in\n             the wrong court in violation of the agreement of the parties\n             contained in the [MSA] ....\n\n      7.     As stated above, the case was brought in the wrong county ....\n             It should properly be in Victoria County. However, based upon\n             the disposition and the Arbitration Award there is nothing to\n             transfer to Victoria other th[a]n the entry of the Judgment for\n             attorney’s fees granted in the Arbitration Award.\n\n(CR 279-80.) This is more than adequate reasoning to support the arbitrator’s\n\ndecision to rule on the motion to abate or transfer venue on the ground that it was\n\nnot moot and was not in excess of his authority. Ocker’s argument to the contrary\n\nentails disregarding the arbitrator’s explanation.\n\n      Ocker also complains, in the same general section of his brief, that the\n\narbitrator did not properly calculate the fees and costs that he awarded to\n\nEddleman for prevailing on the motion to abate or transfer venue. (Ocker’s Am.\n\nBr. at 35-36.) Judge Stith’s order denying confirmation (and granting vacatur) did\n\nnot in any way address the calculation of these fees and costs. This is consistent\n\nwith the fact that Ocker, in his motion to vacate the arbitration award, did not\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fargue that these fees and costs had been calculated improperly; he only contended\n\nthat they were entirely improper because the arbitrator “made no rulings or\n\nfindings consistent with Texas law that Sherri Eddleman was the prevailing party\n\nin this litigation.” (CR 244.)\n\n      But even if Ocker’s failure to argue this particular error to the district court\n\ndoes not waive his right to do so now, his argument has no merit. The attorney’s\n\nfee award represented only work that occurred in connection with the litigation in\n\nthe 319th District Court,14 where (as the arbitrator explained) Eddleman prevailed\n\non two issues: (1) she defeated Ocker’s claim that she violated the MSA by not\n\nexchanging the children in Cameron, and (2) she prevailed on the venue issue.\n\n(CR 279 at ¶ 4.) But winning on the motion to transfer venue, according to Ocker,\n\ndid not qualify Eddleman for an award of fees under ¶ 10 because it was not a\n\nmotion “to construe or enforce the [MSA].” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 36.) And because\n\nthe arbitrator failed to segregate the fee award by the two issues, Ocker believes\n\nthere is a risk of it improperly including amounts for litigating the venue issue:\n\n“[t]he Arbitrator does not distinguish in his award of attorney’s fees, how much of\n\nthe attorney’s fees he awarded are attributable to this Motion to Transfer Venue,\n\nso the entire award should be set aside.” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 35.)\n\n      14\n        “[Eddleman’s counsel’s] letter to [the arbitrator] ... requested fees only in\nconnection with the litigation in the 319th Judicial District.” (CR 374 at ¶ 2.)\n\n\n                                          21\n\f      That is an absurd argument. The MSA provided that it was “made and\n\nperformable in Victoria County” (CR 90 at ¶ 9), a provision clearly designed to\n\ncreate venue in Victoria County. Therefore, when Ocker sued Eddleman in Nueces\n\nCounty, alleging that she was violating the MSA, her motion to abate or transfer\n\nthat action plainly and simply sought to enforce ¶ 9 of the MSA.\n\n      Ocker even goes so far as to say that his suit in Nueces County, alleging that\n\nEddleman was violating the MSA, “was not a lawsuit brought to enforce or\n\nconstrue the [MSA], [but] it was a lawsuit seeking damages for a breach of the\n\n[MSA].” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 36.) Consequently, Ocker believes that once again\n\nEddleman did not prevail on enforcement or construal of the MSA when she\n\ndefeated the claim. But how Ocker could possibly have won damages for breach of\n\nthe MSA without the 319th District Court construing or enforcing the MSA is a\n\nquestion that Ocker’s brief does not even try to answer.\n\n      D.     The Procedural Posture of This Appeal\n\n      Ocker states that if Eddleman wins her appeal of the denial of her motion to\n\nconfirm the arbitration award, then her decision not to appeal the granting of his\n\nmotion for vacatur “will create the unfortunate circumstance where there will be\n\ntwo separate outcomes from the same arbitration.” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 6.) Clearly,\n\nOcker has failed to appreciate—and nowhere addresses— Eddleman’s discussion\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fof that very issue in her original brief:\n\n       The granting of Ocker’s motion to vacate is not presently appealable,\n       but that does not preclude Eddleman from appealing the denial of\n       confirmation, nor does it preclude this Court from ordering\n       confirmation. Werline v. E. Texas Salt Water Disposal Co., 209\n       S.W.3d 888 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2006), presented exactly the same\n       scenario: denial of confirmation, and grant of vacatur with an order to\n       rearbitrate. The court of appeals held that denial of confirmation was\n       appealable, and it “render[ed] judgment confirming the arbitrator’s\n       award.” Id. at 901. The Texas Supreme Court affirmed. 307 S.W.3d\n       267 (Tex. 2010).\n\n(Eddleman’s Br. at 1 n.1.) The Texas Supreme Court in Werline saw no problem\n\nwith an appellate judgment that confirmed an arbitration award, regardless of the\n\nnon-appealability of the vacatur. The vacatur is necessarily incompatible with the\n\nconfirmation, and cannot survive confirmation by the higher court. Ocker’s\n\nconcern about this issue has no merit.\n\n                          Conclusion and Prayer for Relief\n\n       The Court should reverse the denial of Eddleman’s motion to confirm the\n\narbitrator’s amended award, and order confirmation of the award in its entirety. The\n\nCourt should also instruct the district court that after it confirms the amended award\n\nin its entirety, it should transfer the action to the 24th District Court, Victoria County.\n\nOnce there, Eddleman will be able to collect the fees and costs specified in the\n\nconfirmed award, and will be able to move for the additional fees and costs that she\n\nhas incurred, in the district court and in this Court, in obtaining confirmation.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fDate: October 7, 2015                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            MAREK, GRIFFIN & KNAUPP\n                                            Post Office Box 2329\n                                            203 N.

The\n\nresponse brief of the appellee, Matthew J. Ocker, does not meaningfully confront\n\nthe body of Texas law that controls this appeal. Instead, he dwells on collateral\n\nirrelevancies concerning the correctness of the decisions of the arbitrator, and even\n\nof Judge Alcala, whose rulings are not at issue in this case.\n\n      If correctness were at issue, Eddleman would still prevail. But the only issue\n\nis whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and he clearly did not. Ocker’s\n\ndecision to ignore the settled and controlling law on that issue means that he has\n\nfailed to challenge what Eddleman’s principal brief established: that the parties’\n\nbroad agreement to arbitrate encompassed all of the disputes on which the\n\narbitrator issued an award in favor of Eddleman, so he did not exceed his\n\nauthority, and the district court reversibly erred in denying Eddleman’s motion to\n\nconfirm. This Court should correct that error.\n\n      1\n         A party normally has 20 days to file a reply brief. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.6(c).\nIn this case, after the Court set oral argument on October 15, it granted appellee’s\nmotion for an extraordinary extension of 90 days to file his response brief. It was\ndue on September 28, which was then altered to September 29. This allowed the\nappellant only 16 days to file the reply, and in reality much less, because the\nappellant would naturally want her reply filed long enough before the oral\nargument that the panel would have adequate time to review it, as the Rules\nenvision.\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      A.     The Breach of Contract Issue\n\n      One of the issues in this appeal is whether the district court erred in finding\n\nthat the arbitrator exceeded his authority by “creating an irreconcilable ambiguity”\n\n(CR 424 at ¶ D) when he found that Eddleman “failed to exchange the children ...\n\nas contemplated by the [Mediated Settlement Agreement with her ex-husband,\n\nOcker],” but also that she was the prevailing party on this breach-of-contract issue.\n\n(Id.) This alleged ambiguity was the district court’s reason for denying\n\nEddleman’s motion to confirm the award (and for granting Ocker’s motion to\n\nvacate). Ocker’s response brief fails to explain why, even if the arbitrator had\n\nrendered an ambiguous decision—and he did not—he exceeded his authority.\n\n      Nothing in Ocker’s response brief changes the fact that when Judge Alcala\n\nordered (at the hearing on June 25, 2013) the parties to return to the mediator, he\n\nheld on the record that the parties’ differences about the MSA meant that “[t]here\n\nis no agreement” (other than the agreements in ¶ 10, including to mediate/\n\narbitrate), and that “the orders ... in effect are the last orders of the Court.”2 And\n\nthere is still no dispute that the MSA required Eddleman to exchange the children\n\nin Cameron, Texas (CR 87), but that “the last orders of the Court” preceding the\n\nMSA did not. There is also no dispute that Eddleman, after the hearing on June 25,\n\n      2\n      Both parties included excerpts from the transcript of the hearing,\nEddleman at Appendix B of her brief, and Ocker at Appendix A of his brief.\n\n\n                                            2\n\f2013, complied with “the last orders of the Court,” not the MSA.\n\n      That she did not comply with the MSA after June 25 was one of Ocker’s\n\ncomplaints in the arbitration,3 but the arbitrator rejected that complaint and found\n\nin favor of Eddleman on the ground that she complied with Judge Alcala’s rulings\n\non June 25 that the MSA was not in effect (other than ¶ 10). There was nothing\n\nambiguous —and nothing that exceeded the arbitrator’s authority—in the\n\narbitrator’s finding that Eddleman prevailed on this issue even though she did not\n\nexchange the children as contemplated by the MSA, because Judge Alcala had\n\nruled that she was not required to do so.\n\n             1.    Lack of Agreement is Not an Affirmative Defense\n\n      Ocker’s response brief contends that the arbitrator should not have\n\nconsidered Eddleman’s argument that the MSA was not in effect when she did not\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. According to Ocker, that was an affirmative\n\ndefense to his claim that Eddleman breached the MSA, and she failed to plead that\n\ndefense in her answer. (Ocker Am. Br. at 10 & 458.)\n\n      On the contrary: MSAs are contracts (as Ocker himself points out: Ocker\n\n\n\n      3\n        It was one of the issues he complained about in the lawsuit he filed in the\n319th District Court (CR 7-8), so it became one of the issues that the parties\nagreed to arbitrate. (CR 246: “The arbitration is intended to resolve all currently\npending issues in the 319th District Court ... as well as all the issues currently\npending in the 13th Court of Appeals.”)\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAm. Br. at 20), of which an essential element is an agreement,4 and in this case\n\nJudge Alcala found that “[t]here is no agreement” (other than the agreements in\n\n¶ 10). When Ocker sued later in the 319th District Court for breach of the MSA\n\nwith respect to the visitation issue, an agreement was an essential element of his\n\nclaim. All Eddleman had to do was deny it, and she did so by way of a general\n\ndenial. (CR 22 at ¶ 14.) An affirmative defense, on the other hand, “does not seek\n\nto defend by merely denying the plaintiff’s claims, but rather seeks to establish an\n\nindependent reason why the plaintiff should not recover.” Texas Beef Cattle Co. v.\n\nGreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1677377\"><a href=\"/opinion/1677377/texas-beef-cattle-co-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (Tex. 1996). Eddleman’s general denial of an\n\nagreement was not independent of Ocker’s contention that there was an\n\nagreement: it was merely a denial of his contention, so it was not an affirmative\n\ndefense that required specific pleading.\n\n             2.    Judge Alcala’s Decision is Not at Issue\n\n      Ocker also wastes ink questioning whether Judge Alcala, in June 2013,\n\nreleased the parties from compliance with the MSA on the ground that “[t]here is\n\nno agreement” (other than ¶ 10). Ocker’s response brief describes this as “an\n\nalleged order” (Ocker Am. Br. at 10), “a phantom Order” (id. at 47), and “clearly\n\n\n\n      4\n       T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v.

That is sheer\n\nnonsense: Judge Alcala was quite clear on the record of the hearing:\n\n      THE COURT: Okay, so the orders are in effect are the last orders of\n      the Court, correct?\n\n      MS. KNAUPP [counsel for Eddleman]: Correct. That are what’s in\n      effect.\n\n      MR. KELLY [counsel for Ocker]: Your Honor, the [MSA]\n      contemplates the agreement of the parties is now in effect.\n\n      THE COURT: No. There’s no agreement, right? There is no\n      agreement by your own words so —\n\n      MR. KELLY: There are disputes, but there is an agreement.\n\n      THE COURT: No. No. There is no agreement. If there are disputes,\n      there’s no agreement. We’re not going to take it that far.\n\n(Eddleman Br., App’x B, Reporter’s Record, Motion Hearing of June 25, 2013, at\n\n29-30.) There is nothing “phantom” about what Judge Alcala said on the record.\n\n      Therefore, Ocker compares what Judge Alcala said on the record with the\n\ncontent of the order he issued on July 10, 2013:5 in Ocker’s view, the fact that the\n\norder says nothing about the status of the MSA is dispositive. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at\n\n13-14 & 43-44.) In so arguing, Ocker loses sight of the motions that Judge Alcala\n\n\n\n      5\n        This order, attached as Appendix C to Ocker’s amended brief, is not part\nof the appellate record of the case, but Eddleman does not dispute that it is an\naccurate copy of Judge Alcala’s order. Eddleman takes no position on whether this\nCourt should take judicial notice of the order.\n\n\n                                           5\n\fhad before him: (1) Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as written, and (2)\n\nOcker’s motion to go back to mediating/arbitrating the content of the MSA.6 Judge\n\nAlcala abated Eddleman’s motion and granted Ocker’s.7 The combined effect of\n\nthese rulings, as well as Judge Alcala’s comments at the hearing on June 25, was\n\nto make clear to anyone paying attention to the case that the MSA was no longer\n\nin effect (other than ¶ 10). That was certainly the message that the arbitrator got:\n\nas he stated in the arbitral award, Judge Alcala “found that there was no current\n\nagreement between the parties.” (CR 305 at ¶ 7.) In drawing that conclusion, the\n\narbitrator in no way exceeded his authority to decide whether Eddleman breached\n\nthe MSA.\n\n      So Ocker retreats to his third alternative position: if Judge Alcala did indeed\n\nrule that there was no enforceable MSA (other than ¶ 10), then he erred in doing\n\nso. (Ocker Am. Br. at 43: “[T]o the extent there is an Order purporting to excuse\n\n\n\n      6\n         Also at issue were Eddleman’s and Ocker’s motions for fees and costs (see\nOcker Am. Br. at Appendix C). Judge Alcala’s denial of Eddleman’s motion is not\nat issue in this appeal, and his abatement of Ocker’s motion is only relevant to the\nnext issue discussed in this reply.\n      7\n        Ocker’s Brief evidences some confusion on this point. It states that Judge\nAlcala “abated his ruling on the pending motions,” which implies that Judge\nAlcala ruled, and then abated his rulings. Rather, the text of the order makes clear\nthat Judge Alcala abated Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as written, and\nOcker’s motion for fees and costs, by declining to rule on them until after the\nmediation/arbitration. (Ocker Am. Br. at Appendix C.)\n\n\n                                          6\n\fEDDLEMAN from her contractual obligations, it is a void order.”) But that is\n\nirrelevant on two levels. At the first level, the ruling by Judge Alcala is not, quite\n\nobviously, under review in this Court. In fact, instead of appealing it in the normal\n\nway, Ocker attacked it collaterally and improperly (thus drawing Eddleman’s\n\nmotion to transfer venue) by filing suit in the 319th District Court. There, he\n\nalleged that Eddleman was “ignoring ... the [MSA]” by failing to exchange the\n\nchildren in Cameron. (CR 7-8.) The only way such a claim could succeed would\n\nbe if Judge Stith disagreed with Judge Alcala that the MSA did not control.\n\n      At the second level of irrelevance, Eddleman readily acknowledges that the\n\narbitrator relied on Judge Alcala’s ruling that the MSA did not control when he\n\nrejected Ocker’s claim that she breached the MSA. The arbitrator simply accepted\n\nthe ruling as the law of the case. Whether to do so was correct as a matter of law is\n\nnot an issue that this Court has any authority to decide because, as it has already\n\nrecognized, “[j]udicial review of an arbitration award ‘is so limited that even a\n\nmistake of fact or law by the arbitrator in the application of substantive law is not\n\na proper ground for vacating an award.’” Black v. Shor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169\n\n(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2013, pet. denied).8\n\n\n\n      8\n       Eddleman’s brief cited many other authorities for the same proposition\n(Eddleman’s Brief at 16-17), and in the interest of brevity does not repeat them all\nhere.\n\n\n                                           7\n\f      Ocker’s brief fails to address this principle of Texas law. Instead, he cites\n\ncase law to support his argument that Judge Alcala had no jurisdiction to set aside\n\nany portion of the MSA. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 42.) But reviewing the correctness of\n\nthe arbitrator’s acceptance of Judge Alcala’s action in the light of case law is\n\nprecisely the sort of mistake-of-law review that Black forbids. And it is all-the-\n\nmore contradictory for Ocker now to criticize the arbitrator for following Judge\n\nAlcala’s action given that Ocker insisted to the arbitrator that the parties’\n\narbitration agreement did not encompass any issues in the 24th District Court. (CR\n\n268.) The arbitrator agreed, and stated in his amended award that\n\n      he has no authority to comment on, critique, or in any way change any\n      Order arising out of the 24th District Court of Victoria County,\n      Texas. For purposes of this First Amended Arbitration Award, this\n      Arbitrator will simply assume that all Orders issuing out of that Court\n      are timely and valid.\n\n(CR 305; see also CR 280 at ¶ 8.) Having gotten what he wanted from the\n\narbitrator—no review of Judge Alcala’s rulings—Ocker now complains that the\n\narbitrator should not have followed the rulings. The Court should not tolerate this\n\nkind of argument.\n\n      The sole issue properly before the Court is whether the arbitrator exceeded\n\nhis authority in deciding that Eddleman did not breach the MSA when she did not\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. That depends not on whether Judge Alcala\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fruled correctly on the status of the MSA, or whether the arbitrator correctly\n\nfollowed Judge Alcala’s ruling, but on something entirely different: whether\n\naccording to “‘the language in the arbitration agreement,’” Schuster v.

App.-Corpus Christi Jan. 15,\n\n2015, pet. denied), the parties agreed to submit the breach issue to arbitration.\n\nOcker nowhere engages that issue in his brief, which is hardly surprising: it is\n\npatent on the face of this record that what the parties agreed to arbitrate included,\n\nin broad and sweeping language, with no exceptions, “all currently pending issues\n\nin the 319th District Court” (CR 246; emphasis added), and those issues included\n\nOcker’s allegation that Eddleman was “ignoring ... the [MSA]” by failing to\n\nexchange the children in Cameron. (CR 7-8.) The parties gave the arbitrator\n\nauthority to decide that issue, he decided it, and that is the end of this part of the\n\nstory. The district court should not have denied Eddleman’s motion to confirm the\n\narbitrator’s rejection of Ocker’s claim of breach of contract.\n\n      B.     The Attorney’s Fees/Costs Issue\n\n             1.     Fees/Costs in the 24th District Court, then in the 2014\n                    Appeal to this Court, then in Arbitration\n\n      At the hearing on June 25, 2013, and later in the written order issued on July\n\n10, 2013, Judge Alcala declined to rule on Ocker’s motion for fees and costs (see\n\nsupra note 7). The motion (CR 98-100) was premised on ¶ 10 of the MSA:\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      10. If one or more disputes arise with regard to the interpretation\n      and/or performance of this Agreement or any of its provisions (pre-\n      decree), including drafting disputes, pre-decree enforcement matters,\n      issues relating to omitted property or the necessity and form of\n      closing documents, the parties agree to resolve the dispute by\n      mediation with MICHAEL P. O’REILLY, the mediator, who\n      facilitated this settlement. If mediation fails, the parties agree to enter\n      into binding arbitration with MICHAEL P. O’REILLY as the\n      arbitrator and his decision on such matters shall be binding on the\n      parties, including any decision as to the allocation of the costs of the\n      arbitrator in the arbitration. If litigation is brought to construe or\n      enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\n      recover attorney’s fees, as well as court costs and expenses, including\n      the cost of the mediation/arbitration.\n\n(CR 90.) In Ocker’s view, he filed “litigation ... to construe or enforce this\n\nAgreement” when (amidst of the parties’ disputes about crafting a judicial decree\n\nthat would supersede the MSA) he opposed Eddleman’s motion to enforce the\n\nMSA as originally written, and filed his own successful motion to require\n\nmediation/arbitration of the disputes.\n\n      Ocker states repeatedly in his brief that after Judge Alcala ordered\n\nmediation/arbitration, Eddleman (or Eddleman’s counsel) refused to comply. (See,\n\ne.g., Ocker’s Am. Br. at 3, 9 & 38.) Ocker never offers any evidentiary support\n\nfrom the record for these statements, only citations to the same unsupported\n\nallegations he made in earlier pleadings. The truth (which is also outside the\n\nrecord) is that when the parties’ counsel conferred shortly after the June 25\n\nhearing to set a date for the mediation/arbitration, Ocker’s counsel stated that he\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwas completely unavailable until August 19. Counsel then discussed August 27,\n\nbut Eddleman’s counsel responded, after checking with Eddleman herself, that\n\nEddleman was not available because that day was at the beginning of the school\n\nyear for herself and other teachers in her school district. Ocker’s counsel then sued\n\nEddleman on August 26 in the 319th District Court, alleging that she was\n\nbreaching the MSA by not exchanging the children in Cameron (and by attaching\n\nvarious unreasonable conditions to mediation/arbitration under ¶ 10 of the MSA).\n\n(CR 6-8.)\n\n      Again, evidence of these efforts to set a mediation date is not in the\n\nappellate record or germane to this appeal, so it is odd that Ocker has felt the need\n\nto make unsupported accusations from outside the record blaming Eddleman for\n\nnot complying with Judge Alcala’s July 10 order. The Court must disregard them.\n\n      Despite the parties’ continuing inability to mediate/arbitrate with Michael\n\nO’Reilly pursuant to Judge Alcala’s July 10 order, they worked with Judge Alcala\n\nhimself. He was able to issue, with both parties’ assistance, an order in November\n\n2013 that, at long last, superseded the MSA. (CR 204-32.) He also addressed\n\nOcker’s motion for fees and costs, which he had declined to rule on in the July 10\n\norder, by denying the motion without explanation. (CR 232.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f      Ocker appealed the denial to this Court in 2014,9 but the parties later agreed\n\nto arbitrate “the issues currently pending in the 13th Court of Appeals” (CR 246)\n\n(along with the MSA breach allegations pending in the 319th District Court), so\n\nthis Court dismissed the appeal. Hence, the parties agreed to let the arbitrator,\n\ninstead of this Court, decide de novo the legal question of whether ¶ 10 of the\n\nMSA entitled Ocker to an award of fees and costs. The arbitrator’s amended\n\narbitration award (CR 304-08) addressed the 2014 Appeal only to state that it\n\nshould be dismissed10—he did not explicitly address the fees/costs issue, nor did\n\nhe award Ocker any fees/costs for “prevailing” on the “litigation” he had filed in\n\nthe 24th District Court, i.e., opposing Eddleman’s motion to enforce the MSA as\n\nwritten, and filing his own motion to compel mediation/arbitration of the disputes\n\nthat had arisen when he tried to inject new issues into the MSA. However, in\n\nresponse to a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law (CR\n\n273 at ¶ 2), the arbitrator stated that he resolved nothing from the 2014 Appeal\n\nbecause “[a]t the time of the arbitration, ... there were no pending issues to be\n\n\n\n      9\n      In the Interest of H.N.O. and M.H.O., No. 13-14-00125-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3541803</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

By the date of his amended award on\nAugust 15, 2014 (CR 304-08), this Court had already dismissed the appeal (see\nsupra note 9), but the arbitrator did not rewrite this portion of the original award.\n\n\n                                          12\n\fresolved.” (CR 279 at ¶ 2.11)\n\n                   a.     Ocker Did Not Prevail in the 2014 Appeal\n\n      Judge Stith refused to confirm the arbitrator’s denial of Ocker’s fees/costs\n\nfor the “litigation” in the 24th District Court because, in his view, Eddleman’s\n\nagreement to arbitrate the appealed issue of fees/costs meant that “the relief sought\n\nin the 13th Court of Appeals had been accomplished.” (CR 423-24 at ¶ B.)\n\nOcker’s response brief defends that view: “When EDDLEMAN, acting through\n\nher attorney, contracted to arbitrate the issues pending in the 13th Court of\n\nAppeals, the relief OCKER sought in this Appellate Court had been in part\n\nachieved ....” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 19-20.)\n\n      That is entirely false. The relief Ocker sought in the 2014 Appeal was from\n\nJudge Alcala’s order denying his motion for fees and costs. His motion had not\n\nasked Judge Alcala to refer the motion to mediation/arbitration,12 so the relief he\n\nsought in this Court could not include such a referral. Eddleman’s agreement to\n\n\n\n      11\n         Ocker filed this request under TEX. R. CIV. P. 298, which requires trial\ncourts to supply, upon request, findings and conclusions in actions tried without a\njury. The rule has no applicability to arbitration proceedings, and it is not clear\nwhy the arbitrator felt bound to reply, especially since the parties’ agreement to\narbitrate waived a record. (CR 247 at ¶ 3.)\n      12\n         The motion said only: “Movant further requests that the Court award him\nhis attorney’s fees, court costs and expenses including the cost of mediation/\narbitration.” (CR 100 at ¶ VI.)\n\n\n                                         13\n\farbitrate the fees and costs in no way handed Ocker a victory on which Judge Stith\n\ncould conclude that Ocker had prevailed in this Court.\n\n      Regardless of whether he prevailed in the 2014 Appeal when Eddleman\n\nagreed to arbitrate its issue of fees and costs, Ocker’s brief complains about the\n\narbitrator’s failure to address those fees and costs. (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 16-17.) (As\n\nnoted above, the arbitrator found that there were “no pending issues to be\n\nresolved” in the 2014 Appeal (CR 279 at ¶ 2.)) That finding is the result of\n\nOcker’s too-clever-by-half maneuvering. As Ocker explained to the arbitrator in\n\nresponse to the original arbitral award, the arbitration agreement “limited your\n\njurisdiction to arbitrate issues concerning any litigation in the 13th Court of\n\nAppeals and the 319th Judicial District Court,” and did not include authority over\n\nany issues in the 24th District Court. (CR 368.) Of course, the issue in the 13th\n\nCourt of Appeals was the issue in the 24th District Court: whether ¶ 10 of the\n\nMSA entitled Ocker to an award of fees and costs. But Ocker had insisted, so the\n\narbitrator’s hands were tied, and he concluded in his amended award that\n\n      he has no authority to comment on, critique, or in any way change any\n      Order arising out of the 24th District Court of Victoria County,\n      Texas. For purposes of this First Amended Arbitration Award, this\n      Arbitrator will simply assume that all Orders issuing out of that Court\n      are timely and valid.\n\n(CR 305; see also CR 280 at ¶ 8.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f      Thus, Ocker’s insistence created the same problem as with the breach of\n\ncontract issue (see supra page 8): he insisted to the arbitrator that he could not\n\ndecide a certain issue, only to fault the arbitrator now for not deciding the issue.\n\nWhatever the Court may think of the arbitrator’s decision that “there were no\n\npending issues to be resolved” because Judge Alcala’s ruling on fees and costs\n\nwas presumed to be “valid” (CR 279 at ¶ 2), it must consider that decision in light\n\nof the dilemma Ocker created.\n\n      But what really dooms Ocker’s position is Black, 443 S.W.3d at 169\n\n(“[j]udicial review of an arbitration award ‘is so limited that even a mistake of fact\n\nor law by the arbitrator in the application of substantive law is not a proper ground\n\nfor vacating an award’”) and similar cases (see Eddleman’s Br. at 16-17) holding\n\nthat the correctness of the arbitrator’s decision is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\nIt is patent on the face of this record that the parties’ agreement to arbitrate\n\nincluded “the issues currently pending in the 13th Court of Appeals” (CR 246),\n\nand those issues included Ocker’s motion for fees and costs on the ground that he\n\n“prevail[ed]” in the “litigation” by getting the July 10 order from Judge Alcala\n\ncompelling mediation and arbitration. The arbitrator decided that the presumed\n\nvalidity of Judge Alcala’s decision—a point on which Ocker had insisted—meant\n\nthat “there were no pending issues to be resolved,” and that is the end of this part\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fof the story. The district court should not have denied Eddleman’s motion to\n\nconfirm the arbitrator’s rejection of this claim for fees and costs.\n\n                    b.    Ocker Did Not Prevail in the 319th District Court\n\n      The arbitrator also had before him Ocker’s other claim for fees and costs,\n\nwhich arose from the litigation in 319th District Court. That claim was premised\n\non the theory that he prevailed by getting Judge Stith to order mediation/\n\narbitration pursuant to ¶ 10 of the MSA, and that he prevailed against Eddleman\n\non the claim that she breached the MSA by not exchanging the children in\n\nCameron after June 25, 2013. (CR 6-7.)\n\n      The arbitrator found that Judge Alcala did not require compliance with the\n\nMSA after June 25, 2013, so naturally he did not award fees on that basis. As we\n\nhave already seen, nothing in Ocker’s response brief explains how the arbitrator\n\nexceeded his authority by following Judge Alcala; consequently, nothing in\n\nOcker’s response brief explains how the arbitrator exceeded his authority by not\n\nawarding fees/costs to Ocker on this issue. It follows that Judge Stith erred in\n\ndenying confirmation on the ground that the failure to award fee/costs to Ocker on\n\nthis issue somehow amounted to exceeding the arbitrator’s authority.\n\n      The arbitrator did not address, and implicitly denied, Ocker’s claim for fees\n\nand costs on the ground that he prevailed by getting Judge Stith’s order\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcompelling mediation/arbitration. Judge Stith, in his later order denying\n\nconfirmation, seems to have believed that getting such an order was sufficient,13\n\n(CR 424), and Ocker’s response brief defends that view:\n\n      The Arbitrator has chosen not to address ... Eddleman’s failure to\n      submit pre-decree disputes to mediation and arbitration. The\n      uncontroverted record reflects that [she] did in fact fail to comply\n      with this requirement until not one but two District Judges ordered\n      her to comply. The record reflects a strong implication that if the\n      Arbitrator had complied with his contractual obligation to consider\n      this alleged breach of contract, OCKER would have been considered\n      the prevailing party, and thus, entitled to his attorney’s fees. We will\n      not know for certain, however, until after the Arbitrator complies with\n      Judge Stith’s order vacating his arbitration ruling, directing him to re-\n      arbitrate in conformity with the Judge’s ruling.\n\n(Ocker’s Br. at 44-45.)\n\n      The argument is groundless. The parties agreed to arbitrate without a record\n\n(CR 247 at ¶ 3), so the court “must presume adequate reasoning and evidence to\n\nsupport the award” (emphasis added).

App.-Corpus Christi 2010, no pet) (“[w]hen there is no transcript of the\n\narbitration hearing, as here, the appellate court will presume the evidence was\n\n\n\n      13\n         “[T]his Court ... ordered [Eddleman] to mediate and arbitrate disputed\nissues regarding the [MSA] yet the Arbitrator did not rule on Movant [Ocker’s]\ncosts and damages as mandated by paragraph 10 of the [MSA].” (CR 424.)\n\n\n                                         17\n\fadequate to support the award”). This is necessary because, without a record, it is\n\nsimply impossible for a reviewing court to know what issues a partly actually\n\nraised during an arbitration. Hence, it is important to point out that Ocker, when he\n\nasked the arbitrator to amend the award on the ground that he exceeded his\n\nauthority, failed to mention that he believed the arbitrator had done so by not\n\nawarding fees and costs for prevailing in the 319th District Court. (CR 371.) An\n\narbitrator’s decision on an issue beyond the scope of the agreement clearly\n\nexceeds the arbitrator’s authority, but the lack of an explicit decision on an issue\n\nwithin the scope of the agreement means little, if anything.\n\n      Further, it was “adequate reasoning” for the arbitrator to construe ¶ 10 to\n\nmean that fees and costs were awardable only for prevailing on a substantive\n\ndispute about the interpretation and/or performance of the MSA, not for obtaining\n\njust an order to mediate/arbitrate a substantive dispute. Otherwise, a party who\n\nprevailed only to the extent of requiring mediation/ arbitration would be entitled to\n\nfees even if that party lost the subsequent arbitration and post-arbitral litigation: an\n\noutcome that would make no sense.\n\n      Eddleman pointed out this interpretation of ¶ 10 in her original brief\n\n(Eddleman’s Br. at 22-23), and nothing in Ocker’s response brief engages the\n\nissue. Instead, Ocker’s speculation about his chances of winning, in the above-\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fquoted passage from his brief, depends entirely upon his own interpretation of\n\nwhat it means to be a “prevailing party” under ¶ 10, without admitting the\n\npossibility of another and more reasonable interpretation. Ocker’s argument\n\ncontradicts SCI Texas and Guardianship, asking the Court to assume that the\n\narbitrator’s reasoning was not adequate for denying this claim for fees (if he\n\npressed it before the arbitrator). Since the arbitrator’s reasoning was adequate on\n\nan issue that Ocker contends was within the scope of the arbitration agreement, the\n\narbitrator clearly did not exceed his authority.\n\n      C.     The Motion to Abate or Transfer Venue\n\n      The final issue is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling on\n\nEddleman’s motion, in the 319th District Court, to transfer the venue of Ocker’s\n\naction to Victoria County. Judge Stith believed that the motion was moot, and so\n\nthe arbitrator’s ruling exceeded his authority. (CR 423 at ¶ A.) Ocker’s response\n\nbrief defends that view, arguing that “Judge Stith’s order directing the parties back\n\nto mediation and arbitration was dispositive of the Motion to Transfer Venue.”\n\n(Ocker’s Am. Br. at 33.)\n\n      That assertion is far from accurate. As Eddleman pointed out in her original\n\nbrief, after Judge Stith declined to rule on the venue motion, the arbitrator\n\ncorrectly saw that deciding it was part of his duty because, with the expectation\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fthat Judge Stith would confirm his award, he foresaw that Judge Stith would then\n\ntransfer the action to Victoria County for collection of the attorney’s fees awarded\n\nto Eddleman. That is, in fact, precisely the explanation that the arbitrator stated in\n\nhis response to Ocker’s request for additional findings and conclusions:\n\n      6.     SHERI EDDLEMAN was entitled to have the proceedings in\n             the 319th District Court abated because the case was brought in\n             the wrong court in violation of the agreement of the parties\n             contained in the [MSA] ....\n\n      7.     As stated above, the case was brought in the wrong county ....\n             It should properly be in Victoria County. However, based upon\n             the disposition and the Arbitration Award there is nothing to\n             transfer to Victoria other th[a]n the entry of the Judgment for\n             attorney’s fees granted in the Arbitration Award.\n\n(CR 279-80.) This is more than adequate reasoning to support the arbitrator’s\n\ndecision to rule on the motion to abate or transfer venue on the ground that it was\n\nnot moot and was not in excess of his authority. Ocker’s argument to the contrary\n\nentails disregarding the arbitrator’s explanation.\n\n      Ocker also complains, in the same general section of his brief, that the\n\narbitrator did not properly calculate the fees and costs that he awarded to\n\nEddleman for prevailing on the motion to abate or transfer venue. (Ocker’s Am.\n\nBr. at 35-36.) Judge Stith’s order denying confirmation (and granting vacatur) did\n\nnot in any way address the calculation of these fees and costs. This is consistent\n\nwith the fact that Ocker, in his motion to vacate the arbitration award, did not\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fargue that these fees and costs had been calculated improperly; he only contended\n\nthat they were entirely improper because the arbitrator “made no rulings or\n\nfindings consistent with Texas law that Sherri Eddleman was the prevailing party\n\nin this litigation.” (CR 244.)\n\n      But even if Ocker’s failure to argue this particular error to the district court\n\ndoes not waive his right to do so now, his argument has no merit. The attorney’s\n\nfee award represented only work that occurred in connection with the litigation in\n\nthe 319th District Court,14 where (as the arbitrator explained) Eddleman prevailed\n\non two issues: (1) she defeated Ocker’s claim that she violated the MSA by not\n\nexchanging the children in Cameron, and (2) she prevailed on the venue issue.\n\n(CR 279 at ¶ 4.) But winning on the motion to transfer venue, according to Ocker,\n\ndid not qualify Eddleman for an award of fees under ¶ 10 because it was not a\n\nmotion “to construe or enforce the [MSA].” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 36.) And because\n\nthe arbitrator failed to segregate the fee award by the two issues, Ocker believes\n\nthere is a risk of it improperly including amounts for litigating the venue issue:\n\n“[t]he Arbitrator does not distinguish in his award of attorney’s fees, how much of\n\nthe attorney’s fees he awarded are attributable to this Motion to Transfer Venue,\n\nso the entire award should be set aside.” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 35.)\n\n      14\n        “[Eddleman’s counsel’s] letter to [the arbitrator] ... requested fees only in\nconnection with the litigation in the 319th Judicial District.” (CR 374 at ¶ 2.)\n\n\n                                          21\n\f      That is an absurd argument. The MSA provided that it was “made and\n\nperformable in Victoria County” (CR 90 at ¶ 9), a provision clearly designed to\n\ncreate venue in Victoria County. Therefore, when Ocker sued Eddleman in Nueces\n\nCounty, alleging that she was violating the MSA, her motion to abate or transfer\n\nthat action plainly and simply sought to enforce ¶ 9 of the MSA.\n\n      Ocker even goes so far as to say that his suit in Nueces County, alleging that\n\nEddleman was violating the MSA, “was not a lawsuit brought to enforce or\n\nconstrue the [MSA], [but] it was a lawsuit seeking damages for a breach of the\n\n[MSA].” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 36.) Consequently, Ocker believes that once again\n\nEddleman did not prevail on enforcement or construal of the MSA when she\n\ndefeated the claim. But how Ocker could possibly have won damages for breach of\n\nthe MSA without the 319th District Court construing or enforcing the MSA is a\n\nquestion that Ocker’s brief does not even try to answer.\n\n      D.     The Procedural Posture of This Appeal\n\n      Ocker states that if Eddleman wins her appeal of the denial of her motion to\n\nconfirm the arbitration award, then her decision not to appeal the granting of his\n\nmotion for vacatur “will create the unfortunate circumstance where there will be\n\ntwo separate outcomes from the same arbitration.” (Ocker’s Am. Br. at 6.) Clearly,\n\nOcker has failed to appreciate—and nowhere addresses— Eddleman’s discussion\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fof that very issue in her original brief:\n\n       The granting of Ocker’s motion to vacate is not presently appealable,\n       but that does not preclude Eddleman from appealing the denial of\n       confirmation, nor does it preclude this Court from ordering\n       confirmation.

The Texas Supreme Court in Werline saw no problem\n\nwith an appellate judgment that confirmed an arbitration award, regardless of the\n\nnon-appealability of the vacatur. The vacatur is necessarily incompatible with the\n\nconfirmation, and cannot survive confirmation by the higher court. Ocker’s\n\nconcern about this issue has no merit.\n\n                          Conclusion and Prayer for Relief\n\n       The Court should reverse the denial of Eddleman’s motion to confirm the\n\narbitrator’s amended award, and order confirmation of the award in its entirety. The\n\nCourt should also instruct the district court that after it confirms the amended award\n\nin its entirety, it should transfer the action to the 24th District Court, Victoria County.\n\nOnce there, Eddleman will be able to collect the fees and costs specified in the\n\nconfirmed award, and will be able to move for the additional fees and costs that she\n\nhas incurred, in the district court and in this Court, in obtaining confirmation.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fDate: October 7, 2015                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            MAREK, GRIFFIN & KNAUPP\n                                            Post Office Box 2329\n                                            203 N.
