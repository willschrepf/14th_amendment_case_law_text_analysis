Tribe, American Constitutional Law, &#167; 15-6, at 903 (1978).  In a thoughtful analysis of Meyer and Pierce, Professor Tribe opined:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>One subsequent explanation of their joint import has been that they demonstrated judicial solicitude for the Catholics in Oregon and the Germans in Nebraska against whom the invalidated statutes had evidently been directed because of the inability of those groups adequately to safeguard their interests through the political processes of their states.  That notion is worth stressing as illustrative of a general technique-that of assessing alleged invasions of personhood in their historical and social context.... A rule that might be sustained as a proper expression of community interest were it to affect the population as a whole might thus be invalidated as a violation of personality when it operates to single out, if not to submerge, a distinct group in the society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L. Tribe, supra, &#167; 15-6, at 904 (footnotes omitted) (citing United States v. Carolene Prods.  Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783-84, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938)).  Such concerns are not present in the matter now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees cite as controlling precedent a line of Supreme Court decisions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> which purportedly recognize the existence of a \"private realm of family life which the state cannot enter,\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. at 166, 64 S.Ct. at 442, absent compelling reasons.  Uncertainty abounds, not only as to the constitutional spring from which this family privacy right flows, but also as to its definition and character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recent decisions by the Supreme Court declaring that parents have no constitutional right to educate their children in private segregated academies, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), or to demand approval before the administration of corporal punishment in school, Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977), or to exercise an absolute veto power over a minor child's decision to terminate a pregnancy via abortion, Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), clearly signal that parental authority falls short of being constitutionally absolute.  Confronted with these situations which, at first blush, appear to rest at the heart of parental decision making, the Supreme Court refrained from clothing parental judgment with a constitutional mantle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case presents a similar inquiry.  Reduced to essentials, the legal questions posed are: (1) whether parents possess a fundamental right to send their children to summer athletic camps; and (2) whether the children have a constitutional right to attend such activities.  As is frequently the case, in the very postulation of the questions the answer lies.  A negative response to both questions is mandated.  This case implicates no fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination that no fundamental right to participate in summer athletic camp exists establishes the level of scrutiny to which we must subject section 21.  The regulation will pass constitutional muster if it is found to have a rational basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Due Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UIL contends that its rules are designed to make competition among its 1,142 member schools as fair and equitable as possible.  The UIL program, including the athletics component, is only a part of the overall educational process.  Several reasons are advanced in support of section 21, including the need to control over-zealous coaches, parents and communities, the achieving of a competitive balance between those who can afford to attend summer camp and those who cannot, the avoidance of various excessive pressures on students, and the abrogation of the use of camps as recruiting mechanisms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be argued seriously that section 21 is wholly arbitrary and totally without value in the promotion of a legitimate state objective.  We do not evaluate the ultimate wisdom, vel non, of section 21, or the sagacity of its methodology.  The school authorities have concluded that section 21 serves the purpose of making interscholastic athletics fairer and more competitive.  We are not prepared to say that section 21 bears no meaningful relationship to the achievement of that ideal.  The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment has not been offended.  See City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976); Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, the equal protection analysis has been performed against the backdrop of the standards of strict scrutiny and minimum rationality.  To withstand strict scrutiny, a statute must necessarily relate to a compelling state interest.  Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973).  The rational basis test requires only that the legislation or regulation under challenge rationally promote a legitimate governmental objective.  McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state action viewed under the rational basis banner is presumed to be valid.  In such a situation, \"the burden is not upon the state to establish the rationality of its restriction, but is upon the challenger to show that the restriction is wholly arbitrary.\"  Karr v. Schmidt, 460 F.2d 609, 617 (5th Cir. 1972) (en banc).  Accordingly, only when a demonstration is made that the classification contained in the regulation is wholly arbitrary or does not teleologically relate to a permissible governmental objective is the equal protection clause violated.  When \"the classification created by the regulatory scheme neither trammels fundamental rights or interests nor burdens an inherently suspect class, equal protection analysis requires that the classification be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\"  Walsh v. Louisiana High School Athletic Ass'n, 616 F.2d 152, 160 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1124, 101 S.Ct. 939, 67 L.Ed.2d 109 (1981) (citing Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 99 S.Ct. 1742, 60 L.Ed.2d 269 (1979); City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976); Jackson v. Marine Exploration Co., 583 F.2d 1336 (5th Cir. 1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the Supreme Court's prevailing opinions and our decisions in Walsh and Parish v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 506 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1975), we believe that the minimum rationality test provides the guide for our equal protection evaluation.  See Denis J. O'Connell High Sch. v. Virginia High Sch. League, 581 F.2d 81 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 99 S.Ct. 1280, 59 L.Ed.2d 494 (1979); Moreland v. Western Pa.  Interscholastic, etc.  League, 572 F.2d 121 (3d Cir. 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly section 21 operates to treat student-athletes who attend summer athletic camps differently from those students who do not.  The former lose eligibility in all varsity sports for the next year.  But the categorization is not premised on impermissible, suspect grounds.  Nor does the classification impinge upon the exercise of fundamental rights.  The rule seeks to achieve a balance in interscholastic athletics.  It is not unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court, in these consolidated cases, is REVERSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Former Fifth Circuit case, Section 9(1) of Public Law 96-452-October 14, 1980</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Due to his death on May 15, 1981, Judge Gewin did not participate in this decision; the case is being decided by a quorum.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 46(d)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Article VIII, Section 21, provides:</p>\n        <p>Training Camps Forbidden.-Any student who attends a special athletic training camp in football or basketball shall be ineligible for a period of one year from the date he enrolls in the camp for any athletic contest in the League.

As is frequently the case, in the very postulation of the questions the answer lies.  A negative response to both questions is mandated.

The UIL program, including the athletics component, is only a part of the overall educational process.  Several reasons are advanced in support of section 21, including the need to control over-zealous coaches, parents and communities, the achieving of a competitive balance between those who can afford to attend summer camp and those who cannot, the avoidance of various excessive pressures on students, and the abrogation of the use of camps as recruiting mechanisms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be argued seriously that section 21 is wholly arbitrary and totally without value in the promotion of a legitimate state objective.  We do not evaluate the ultimate wisdom, vel non, of section 21, or the sagacity of its methodology.  The school authorities have concluded that section 21 serves the purpose of making interscholastic athletics fairer and more competitive.  We are not prepared to say that section 21 bears no meaningful relationship to the achievement of that ideal.  The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment has not been offended.
