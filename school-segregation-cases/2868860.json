S 499a et seq. (\"PACA\"), and\ntherefore subject to its trust provision, 7 U.S.C.S 499e(c).\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\nDelaware held that they are, and subsequently granted\npartial summary judgment in favor of the Appellant. The\nUnited States District Court reversed. We hold that\nrestaurants are dealers under the plain language of PACA,\nand we therefore reverse the order of the district court and\nreinstate the order of the bankruptcy court.\n\n                                  2\n\n\nI.\n\nOn April 6, 1995, Magic Restaurants, Inc. and Magic\nAmerican Cafe, Inc. (collectively \"Magic\")filed voluntary\nbankruptcy petitions in the bankruptcy court for\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nMagic, directly or through its subsidiaries, owned and\noperated fifteen restaurants in the Washington, D.C. and\nNew York City metropolitan areas. These restaurants\ngenerated $20 million in sales revenues in a six month\nperiod in 1995-96. Magic purchased fresh fruits and\nvegetables from Bowie Produce Co., Inc. (\"Bowie\"), which it\nprocessed into food items, including salads or hamburger\ntrimmings, and sold to its restaurant customers. At the\ntime Magic filed for bankruptcy in April 1995, it owed\nBowie $98,983.74 for these produce purchases.\n\fBowie commenced an adversarial proceeding in the\nbankruptcy court to recover full payment from Magic on the\nground that the proceeds from the produce Magic had\npurchased were trust funds under Section 5(c) of PACA, 7\nU.S.C. S 499e(c). Magic moved for summary judgment on\nthe ground that as a restaurant, it was not a \"dealer,\" and\nwas therefore not subject to PACA's trust provision. By\nmemorandum opinion and order dated June 18, 1996, the\nbankruptcy court denied Magic's motion and held that\nMagic was a \"dealer\" under the plain language of PACA. On\nJanuary 15, 1997, the bankruptcy court granted partial\nsummary judgment for Bowie, awarding it $93,173.29 in\ntrust proceeds.\n\nMagic appealed the bankruptcy court's ruling to the\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 158(a). The district\ncourt reversed the bankruptcy court by memorandum\nopinion and order dated January 6, 1999, holding that\nMagic was not a \"dealer\" under PACA and therefore was not\nsubject to its trust provision. This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\nA. Statutory Background.\n\nCongress enacted PACA in 1930 \"to promote fair trading\npractices in the marketing of perishable agricultural\n\n\n                               3\n\n\ncommodities, largely fruits and vegetables.\" Consumers\nProduce Co., Inc. v. Volante Wholesale Produce, Inc. , 16 F.3d\n1374, 1377-78 (3d Cir. 1994). PACA was \" `designed\nprimarily for the protection of the producers of perishable\nagricultural products -- most of whom must entrust their\nproducts to a buyer or commission merchant who may be\nthousands of miles away, and depend for their payment\nupon his business acumen and fair dealing.' \" In re\nKornblum & Co., Inc., 81 F.3d 280, 283 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1196, at 2 (1955), reprinted in 1956\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3699, 3701). Producers of perishable\nagricultural goods are in large part dependent upon the\nhonesty and scrupulousness of the purchaser or consignee\nwho geographically may be far removed. To provide\nproducers with some protection, Congress fortified the\noriginal PACA with two primary weapons. First, it\nprohibited certain conduct by \"commission merchants,\"\n\"brokers,\" or \"dealers.\" 7 U.S.C. S 499b. Failure to abide by\nthese prohibitions rendered the \"commission merchant,\ndealer, or broker . . . liable to the person or persons injured\nthereby for the full amount of damages . . . sustained in\n\fconsequence of such violation.\" Id. SS 499e(a) & 499e(b).\nSecond, PACA established a mandatory licensing scheme,\nunder the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture, for\nany \"person\" carrying on \"the business of a commission\nmerchant, dealer, or broker.\" Id. S 499c. The Secretary was\ngiven the power to refuse, suspend, or terminate licenses\non numerous grounds, including conduct prohibited under\nS 499b. See 7 U.S.C. SS 499c, 499d, 499h. Any person\ndoing business without the required license was subject to\nmonetary penalties. Id. S 499c(a).\n\nPACA in its original form therefore protected produce\ngrowers and producers, and worked to make \"the marketing\nof perishable agricultural commodities more orderly and\nefficient.\" Hull Co. v. Hauser's Foods, Inc., 924 F.2d 777,\n779 (8th Cir. 1991). Even with the passage of a half-century\nafter its initial enactment, Congress, in 1984, determined\nthat prevalent financing practices in the perishable\nagricultural commodities industry were placing the industry\nas a whole, including produce sellers, in jeopardy. It\nresponded by amending PACA, explaining:\n\n                               4\n\n\n       It is hereby found that a burden on commerce in\n       perishable agricultural commodities is caused by\n       financing arrangements under which commission\n\n       merchants, dealers, or brokers, who have not made\n       payment for perishable agricultural commodities\n       purchased, contracted to be purchased, or otherwise\n       handled by them on behalf of another person,\n       encumber or give lenders a security interest in, such\n       commodities, or on inventories of food or other\n       products derived from such commodities, and any\n       receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, and that such arrangements\n       are contrary to the public interest. . . .\n\n7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(1).1\n\nIn order to \"remedy such burden on commerce in\nperishable agricultural commodities and to protect the\npublic interest,\" id., Congress \"increase[d] the legal\nprotection for unpaid sellers and suppliers of perishable\nagricultural commodities until full payment of sums due\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The legislative history of the 1984 PACA amendments further explains\nthe problem Congress intended to address:\n\n        Sellers of agricultural commodities are often located thousands of\n       miles from their customers. Sales transactions must be made\n\f       quickly or they are not made at all . . . . Under such conditions,\nit\n       is often difficult to make credit checks, conditional sales\n       agreements, and take other traditional safeguards.\n\n       * * *\n\n        Many [buyers], in the ordinary course of their business\n       transactions, operate on bank loans secured by [their] inventories,\n       proceeds or assigned receivables from sales of perishable\n       agricultural commodities, giving the lender a secured position in\nthe\n       case of insolvency. Under present law, sellers of fresh fruits and\n       vegetables are unsecured creditors and receive little protection in\n       any suit for recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make\n       payment as required by the contract.\n\n        In recent years, produce sellers have been subjected to increased\n       instances of buyers failure to pay and slow payments.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 3 (1983), reprinted in   1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405,\n406.\n\n                               5\n\n\nhave been received by them,\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 3\n(1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406 (emphasis\nadded), by enacting 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c). This provision\nimposes a floating, non-segregated trust on produce buyers\nfor the benefit of unpaid produce suppliers.2 The corpus of\nthis trust is comprised of (1) the perishable agricultural\ncommodities purchased from these suppliers, (2) all\ninventories of food or other products derived from the\nperishable agricultural commodities, and (3) receivables or\nproceeds from the sale of such commodities or products. 7\nU.S.C. S 499e(c)(2). The statutory trustee is the delinquent\n\"commission merchant, dealer, or broker.\" Id. The unpaid\nsupplier loses the benefits of the trust unless written notice\nof intent to preserve the trust is given to the trustee within\nthirty calendar days after payment must be made. Id.\nS 499e(c)(3). In essence, PACA's trust provision gives the\nunpaid supplier an interest in the trust corpus superior to\nthe interest of any other lien or secured creditor. See\nConsumers Produce, 16 F.3d at 1379; In re W.L. Bradley\nCo., Inc., 75 B.R. 505, 509 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1987) (quoting\nIn re Prange Foods, Corp., 63 B.R. 211, 214 (Bankr. W.D.\nMich. 1986)).\n\nB. The District Court's Decision.\n\nBowie's appeal hinges on its contention that Magic is a\n\"dealer\" under PACA.3 If Bowie is correct, it has priority to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f2. The trust provision states, in relevant part:\n\n       Perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission\n       merchant, dealer, or broker in all transactions, and all\ninventories\n\n       of food or other products derived from perishable agricultural\n       commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, shall be held by such commission\n       merchant, dealer, or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid\n       suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the\n       transaction, until full payment of the sums owing in connection\nwith\n\n       such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,\n       sellers, or agents. . . .\n\n7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(2).\n\n3. Bowie did not contend in the bankruptcy court or the district court\nand does not contend now that Magic is a \"commission merchant\" or a\n\"broker.\"\n\n                               6\n\n\ncertain of Magic's assets as the beneficiary of PACA's\nstatutorily imposed trust. PACA defines the term\"dealer\" as\n\"any person engaged in the business of buying or selling in\nwholesale or jobbing quantities, as defined by the\nSecretary, any perishable agricultural commodity in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . .\" 7 U.S.C.S 499a(b)(6).\nPACA also provides three exceptions to this definition:\n\n       (A) no producer shall be considered as a \"deale r\" in\n       respect to sales of any such commodity of his own\n       raising;\n\n       (B) no person buying any such commodity solely for\n       sale at retail shall be considered as a \"dealer\" until the\n       invoice cost of his purchases of perishable agricultural\n       commodities in any calendar year are in excess of\n       $230,000; and\n\n       (C) no person buying any commodity other than\n       potatoes for canning and/or processing within the\n       State where grown shall be considered a \"dealer\"\n       whether or not the canned or processed product is to\n       be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce, unless\n       such product is frozen or packed in ice, or consists of\n       cherries in brine . . . .\n\fId. Finally, this provision notes that \"[a]ny person not\nconsidered as a `dealer' under clauses (A), (B), and (C) may\nelect to secure a license under the provisions of section\n499c of this title, and in such case and while the license is\nin effect such person shall be considered as a `dealer'.\"\nMagic has never secured such a license, and contends that\nno restaurant has done so.\n\nThe parties do not dispute that Magic purchases\n\"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" of perishable agricultural\ncommodities in interstate commerce.4 Bowie therefore\ncontends that, based on the plain language of the statute,\nMagic is a \"dealer\" and is subject to the trust. The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of\nAgriculture (\"USDA\") define \"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" as\n\"aggregate quantities of all types of produce totaling one ton (2,000\npounds) or more in weight in any day shipped, received, or contracted to\nbe shipped or received.\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(x).\n\n                               7\n\n\nbankruptcy court agreed, but the district court reversed.\nThe court held that PACA \"is silent on the issue of whether\nrestaurants qualify as `dealers,' \" and therefore, \"Congress\nhas not spoken directly to the issue of PACA's applicability\nto restaurants.\" (A.7). Thus, the district court proceeded to\nconsider regulations promulgated by the USDA under its\nauthority to administer PACA. See 7 U.S.C.S 499o.\n\nThese USDA regulations define \"dealer\" as:\n\n       any person engaged in the business of buying or selling\n       in wholesale or jobbing quantities in commerce and\n       includes:\n\n        (1) Jobbers, distributors and other wholesaler s;\n\n        (2) Retailers, when the invoice cost of all pu rchases\n       of produce exceeds $230,000 during a calendar year.\n       In computing dollar volume, all purchases of fresh and\n       frozen fruits and vegetables are to be counted, without\n       regard to quantity involved in a transaction or whether\n       the transaction was intrastate, interstate or foreign\n       commerce;\n\n        (3) Growers who market produce grown by others.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.2(m). The district court concluded that under\nthis regulation, in order to be a \"dealer\" an entity had to fall\ninto one of the categories enumerated in 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(m)(1), (2), or (3). The court determined that the only\n\fpossible category a restaurant such as Magic could fall into\nwas that of \"retailers\" under 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(m)(2), but\nconcluded that restaurants such as Magic were consumers,\nnot retailers. Accordingly, the district court held that under\nthis USDA regulation, Magic was not a dealer.\n\nThe court found support for this conclusion in two\nadditional sources. First, in 1996, USDA amended its\nregulatory definition of \"fresh fruits and vegetables,\" 7\nC.F.R. S 46.2(u), to include oil-blanched frozen fruits and\nvegetables, thereby bringing such produce within PACA's\nreach. In its statement accompanying publication of the\nfinal rule, USDA described a comment it received from a\nrepresentative of a major restaurant chain voicing its\nconcern that the rule change \"might bring restaurants\nunder the jurisdiction of the PACA.\" Final Rule,\n\n                               8\n\n\n\"Regulations (Other Than Rules of Practice) Under the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (PACA),\" 61\nFed. Reg. 13385, 13386 (Mar. 27, 1996). USDA responded:\n\n       Restaurants traditionally have not been considered\n       subject to the PACA by USDA or Congress unless the\n       buying arm of the restaurant is a separate legal entity,\n       and is buying for and/or reselling the product to\n       another entity. Since restaurants are not subject to the\n       PACA, this change in the regulation will not impact\n       restaurants.\n\nId.\n\nSecond, in 1995, Congress amended PACA. These\namendments had no bearing on who was and was not\ncovered by the statute.5 In the report of the House\nCommittee on Agriculture accompanying the 1995 PACA\nAmendments Act, the Committee explained that:\n\n       Section 3 phases out license fees for retailers and\n       grocery wholesalers. It defines the term \"retailer\" as a\n       person who is a dealer engaged in the business of\n       selling any perishable commodity at retail.\n       Approximately 4,000 retailers are currently estimated\n       to be licensed under PACA. Those businesses such as\n       grocery stores and other like businesses that\n       predominantly serve those consumers purchasing food\n       for consumption at home or off the premises of the\n       retail establishment are considered to be included in\n       the definition of retailer. It is not the intent of the\n       Committee that the definition of retailer be construed\n       to include foodservice establishments such as\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f5. Essentially, the 1995 amendments phased retailers and grocery\nwholesalers out of license fee payment, allowed USDA to adjust license\nfees under its rulemaking authority, \"require[d] USDA to receive a\nwritten complaint before pursuing an investigation, require[d] additional\nUSDA investigation notification procedures, increase[d] . . .\nadministrative penalties, establishe[d] civil penalties, clarifie[d] the\nstatus\nof collateral fees and expenses, and clarifie[d] misbranding prohibitions\n. . . .\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-207, at 6 (1995), reprinted in 1995\nU.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n453, 453. Other than these changes, the House Committee on\nAgriculture explained, the law remained unaffected. Id.\n\n                                9\n\n\n       restaurants, or schools, hospitals and other\n       institutional cafeterias.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-207, at 7 (1995), reprinted in   1995\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 453, 454.\n\nAccordingly, based on this regulatory interpretation and\nlegislative history, the district court held that restaurants\nsuch as Magic are not \"dealers\" and are therefore not\nsubject to PACA's trust provision.\n\nIII.\n\nThe question of whether a restaurant with extensive\noperations such as Magic is a \"dealer\" under PACA is a\npurely legal determination. Accordingly, this court exercises\nplenary review over the judgment of the district court. In re\nReading Co., 115 F.3d 1111, 1124 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nA. The Statutory Language.\n\nIn resolving this issue, the first question we must ask is\nwhether the plain language of the statute is unambiguous.\nIdahoan Fresh v. Advantage Produce, Inc., 157 F.3d 197,\n202 (3d Cir. 1998). If it is, there is generally no need to look\nto administrative interpretations or to legislative history.\nRatzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 147-48 (1994);\nIdahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 202; West v. Sullivan, 973 F.2d\n179, 185 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 962 (1993).\nIf the statute is \"silent or ambiguous as to the specific\nissue,\" and an administrative agency charged with\nadministering the statute has devised its own regulatory\ninterpretation of the statute, the court must then ask\n\"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\" West, 973 F.2d 179 at 185\n(quoting Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Def.\n\fCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984)).\n\nIn the more than half-century since the initial enactment\nof PACA, only three other courts have addressed whether\nrestaurants are \"dealers\" under it. We appear to be the only\nUnited States Court of Appeals to consider the question.\nRecently, two district courts in California concluded, like\nthe bankruptcy court in this case, that restaurants are\n\n                               10\n\n\n\"dealers\" under the plain language of PACA. See Royal\nFoods Co. v. L.R. Holdings, Inc., No. C 99-01609, 1999 WL\n1051978 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 1999); JC Produce, Inc. v.\nParagon Steakhouse Restaurants, Inc., 70 F. Supp.2d 1119\n(E.D. Cal. 1999). However, in In re Italian Oven, Inc., 207\nB.R. 839 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1997), the bankruptcy court, like\nthe district court in this case, held that PACA's definition of\n\"dealer\" is ambiguous, that the USDA regulation defining\n\"dealer\" did so to the exclusion of anyone not expressly\ndescribed by the regulation, and that the restaurant debtor\nin that case was not a retailer under this regulation and\ntherefore not subject to PACA's trust provision. The Italian\nOven court considered and expressly rejected the reasoning\nof the bankruptcy court in this case. Id. at 842-43.6\n\nAs noted above, USDA, the agency charged with\nadministering PACA, has indicated its view that restaurants\nare not \"dealers\" under that statute. Indeed, that agency's\nconsistent practice for seven decades since PACA's\nenactment has been to deny that the statute gives it\njurisdiction over restaurants.7 Nevertheless, \"a reviewing\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. It gave three reasons in support of its holding that PACA's definition\nof \"dealer\" was ambiguous and resort to administrative materials was\nappropriate. The first reason was that prior to the bankruptcy court's\ndecision in this case, there had been no reported decisions dealing with\nwhether PACA applies to restaurants, even though the statute had been\nin existence since 1930. Id. at 843. The court's second reason is\nconfusing, but appears to have had something to do with PACA's silence\nas to its applicability to restaurants. Id. The third reason was that PACA\nempowered the USDA to administer the statute by enacting regulations.\nId. at 843-44. For the same reasons discussed herein, the Italian Oven\ncourt's first two reasons for looking beyond the plain statutory\ndefinition\n\nof \"dealer\" are unconvincing to us. Additionally, its third reason is\nirrelevant to an inquiry into the ambiguity of statutory text.\n\n7. This practice is further evidenced by USDA's communications with\nMagic. A July 6, 1995 letter to counsel for Magic from a USDA official\napparently responsible for license and program review in the PACA\n\fBranch of USDA's Fruit and Vegetable Division explained that official's\nview that \"[r]estaurants are not considered`dealers,' `brokers,'\n`commission merchants' or any other entity whose operations are subject\nto the PACA,\" and that \"[t]he PACA is not applicable to a restaurant that\ndoes not act as a central distributor for subsidiary restaurants\nirrespective of where it obtains it perishable commodities.\" (A.16).\n\n                               11\n\n\ncourt should not defer to an agency position which is\ncontrary to an intent of Congress expressed in\nunambiguous terms.\" Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling\nCo., 505 U.S. 469, 476 (1992).\n\nUltimately, this case turns on whether the statutory\ndefinition of \"dealer\" found in PACA is unambiguous with\nrespect to its inclusion of restaurants such as Magic. As\ndiscussed above, PACA states that subject to certain\nexceptions, a dealer is \"any person engaged in the business\nof buying or selling in wholesale or jobbing quantities, as\ndefined by the Secretary, any perishable agricultural\ncommodity in interstate or foreign commerce . . . .\" 7 U.S.C.\nS 499a(b)(6). Because \"the term `person' includes\nindividuals, partnerships, corporations, and associations,\"\nid. S 499a(b)(1), Magic is a \"person\" under PACA.\nFurthermore, the parties do not dispute that Magic\npurchased \"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" of produce,\nwhich USDA regulations define as \"aggregate quantities of\nall types of produce totaling one ton (2,000 pounds) or more\nin weight in any day shipped, received, or contracted to be\nshipped or received.\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(x). Additionally, Magic\ndoes not contend that it falls within any of the three\nstatutory exceptions to PACA's definition of \"dealer.\" See 7\nU.S.C. S 499a(b)(6)(A), (B), and (C).\n\nAt oral argument in this case, it was suggested that\nCongress's employment of the words \"engaged in the\nbusiness of \" in defining the category of\"dealers\" rendered\nthis definition ambiguous, because this language could be\ninterpreted to restrict the meaning of \"dealer\" to include\nonly those engaged primarily in the business of buying or\nselling perishable agricultural commodities. However,\nnothing about the ordinary meaning of the words\"engaged\"\nor \"business\" indicates that the statutory definition should\nbe understood to apply only to those engaged primarily in\nthis business. This \"engaged in the business of \" language\nspeaks to the type of business required to invoke\njurisdiction under PACA, not to the quantity thereof.\nCongress spoke to quantity later in this definition, when it\n\n                               12\n\frestricted the category of \"dealers\" to those doing business\n\"in wholesale or jobbing quantities.\"8\n\nThere is therefore nothing ambiguous about the\napplication of this statutory definition to the facts of this\ncase. The district court's conclusion that the definition is\nambiguous because it does not explicitly state whether\nrestaurants are dealers is specious. Because Congress\nchose to define the word \"dealer\" in broad terms, rather\nthan by specifically identifying each entity that falls into\nthis category, does not automatically render the definition\nambiguous.\n\nB. The Statutory Purpose.\n\nEven where the express language of a statute appears\nunambiguous, a court must look beyond that plain\nlanguage where a literal interpretation of this language\nwould thwart the purpose of the overall statutory scheme,\nUnited States v. Jersey Shore Bank, 781 F.2d 974, 977 (3d\nCir. 1986), aff 'd, 479 U.S. 442 (1987), would lead to an\nabsurd result, id., or would otherwise produce a result\n\"demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters,\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The interpretation given to the definition of \"dealer\" in the Packers\nand\nStockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. S 181 et seq. (\"PSA\"), lends additional support\nto this conclusion. PACA's trust provision was modeled on that of the\nPSA, and this court has previously observed that authority developed\nunder the PSA is persuasive in interpreting PACA's trust. See Consumers\nProduce, 16 F.3d at 1382 n.5. Using language nearly identical to that\nused in PACA, the PSA defines a \"dealer\" as\"any person . . . engaged in\nthe business of buying or selling in commerce livestock at a stockyard\n. . . .\" Id. S 201(d). The only decision interpreting the PSA's \"engaged\nin\n\nthe business of \" language of which we are aware confirms our\ninterpretation of PACA's identical language. See Kelley v. United States,\n202 F.2d 838, 841 (10th Cir. 1953) (\"engaged in the business of \"\nlanguage cannot be read to mean engaged in the sole business of); see\nalso United States v. Perdue Farms, Inc., 680 F.2d 277, 285 (2d Cir.\n1982) (interpreting PSA's nearly identical definition of \"live poultry\ndealer,\" 7 U.S.C. S 218b (repealed 1987), and concluding that \"rather\nthan focusing upon the absolute amount of packing business or live\npoultry business a firm engaged in, Congress chose to make the USDA's\njurisdiction dependent upon the activity of the business . . . , no matter\nhow small . . . .\").\n\n                               13\n\n\nDemarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184, 190 (1991) (quoting\nGriffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571\n\f(1982)).\n\nNevertheless, it cannot be seriously contended that\nholding that restaurants purchasing perishable agricultural\ncommodities in wholesale or jobbing quantities, as defined\nby the Secretary, are \"dealers\" under PACA is contrary to\nthe statute's purpose, absurd, or \"demonstrably at odds\nwith the intentions of the drafters.\" There is no clear\nevidence of legislative intent regarding treatment of such\nrestaurants at the time the definition of \"dealer\" was\noriginally enacted in 1930. Indeed, the only such evidence\nof legislative intent is the statement contained in the 1995\nHouse Agriculture Committee report that the Committee did\nnot intend that restaurants be included within the\ndefinition of \"retailers\" enacted in the 1995 PACA\nAmendments Act. That statement, however, is confined to\nthe amendment. This committee report was issued more\nthan 30 years after the last time Congress modified the\ndefinition of \"dealer\" in any substantial way,9 and dealt with\nissues wholly different from this definition. See supra note\n6. This report language is not something \"upon which other\nlegislators might have relied in voting for or against\" the\nstatutory definition of \"dealer,\" and cannot constitute\nevidence of the legislative intent behind that definition. See\nHeintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. 291, 298 (1995). As the\nSupreme Court has observed, \"the views of a subsequent\nCongress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of\nan earlier one.\" United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313\n(1960); see also Pennsylvania Med. Society v. Snider, 29\nF.3d 886, 898 (3d Cir. 1994). We therefore disregard this\nHouse committee report.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Pub L. No. 87-725, 1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2749, substituted \"wholesale or\njobbing quantities\" for \"carloads.\" Amendments in 1969, 1978, and 1981\nincrease the monetary amount under current section 499a(b)(6)(B) from\n$90,000 to $100,000, $100,000 to $200,000, and $200,000 to $230,000,\nrespectively. See Pub. L. No. 97-98, 1981 U.S.C.C.A.N. (95 Stat.) 1213,\n1269; Pub. L. No. 95-562, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 2381; Pub. L. No.\n91-107, 1969 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1225. In addition, the 1978 amendment\ninserted \"other than potatoes\" after \"commodity\" in current section\n499a(b)(6)(C). See Pub L. No. 95-562, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 2381.\n\n                               14\n\n\nMoreover, requiring restaurants that purchase large\nquantities of produce to comply with PACA furthers the\ngoals of the statute as amended in 1984. Although the\noriginal PACA was enacted to protect produce growers and\nproducers, the 1984 amendments, including the trust\nprovision, were enacted for the protection of all produce\nsellers and suppliers. Holding restaurant-purchasers\nresponsible to produce sellers such as Bowie provides\n\fprotection of produce suppliers up through the distribution\nchain and therefore furthers the purposes of the trust\nprovision.\n\nMagic contends that if this court holds that restaurants\nare \"dealers,\" and therefore subject to PACA, the\nrepercussions would be \"staggering\" because\"all of the\nhundreds of thousands of restaurants in this country\" that\nhave never applied for licenses under PACA \"have been in\ndirect violation of federal law, for decades.\" (Appellee's Br.\nat 18-19). To some extent, Magic may have a point. Under\nPACA, any person failing to obtain a license through\ninadvertence rather than wilfulness may \"be permitted by\nthe Secretary . . . to settle his liability in the matter by the\npayment of fees due for the period covered by such violation\nand an additional sum, not in excess of $250, to befixed by\nthe Secretary . . . .\" 7 U.S.C. 499c(b). Should the Secretary\nchoose to pursue such violations, these licensing fees could\nadd up to substantial amounts over the 70-year period in\nwhich PACA has been in force.\n\nIt is not clear how many restaurants actually purchase\nproduce in \"wholesale or jobbing quantities,\" and are\ntherefore subject to PACA's licensing requirement. The\nparties have offered no evidence on this point. We suspect,\nhowever, that the number of restaurants that do so is far\nsmaller than Magic contends. In addition, we would be very\nsurprised if the Secretary chose to pursue enforcement of\nsuch violations retroactively. Even if the Secretary does\nattempt to enforce PACA's penalty provisions against these\n\"violating\" restaurants, the long history of non-enforcement\nagainst restaurants in this case may be sufficiently\nextraordinary as to permit restaurants to successfully argue\nthe application of equitable estoppel or laches.\n\n                                15\n\n\nWe recognize that the USDA has refused to exercise\njurisdiction over restaurants pursuant to PACA for\napproximately seven decades. It is this benign neglect that\nis responsible for much of the confusion in this area.\nNevertheless, we are constrained by PACA's unambiguous\nstatutory language to hold that a restaurant such as Magic,\nwhich purchases produce in wholesale or jobbing quantities\n(and in excess of $230,000 per year), is a \"dealer\" under 7\nU.S.C. S 499a(b)(6), and administrative interpretations\ncontrary to this plain language are therefore not persuasive.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the January 6, 1999 order of\nthe district court will be reversed, and the case remanded\nto the district court with instructions to reinstate the\n\fJanuary 15, 1997 order of the bankruptcy court granting\npartial summary judgment in favor of Bowie. Each side to\nbear its own costs.\n\n                               16\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI respectfully dissent because I find the phrase\"engaged\nin the business of buying or selling . . .\" to be susceptible\nof a different meaning from that given it by the majority.\n\nRestaurants are engaged in the business of preparing\nand selling meals to customers. Not only is buying or\nselling perishables in large quantities not their primary\nbusiness, it is not their business at all. 10 Admittedly, in the\ncourse of their business, they do buy perishables in great\nquantities. If PACA was intended to include them, Congress\nshould have said, \"any business that buys or sells . . .\"; it\ndid not. As I read the statute, it confines the concept of\n\"dealer\" to those who do this as their bread and butter, so\nto speak. The majority reading would make most prisons\n\"dealers,\" yet prisons are not engaged in the perishable\ncommodity-buying business.\n\nThe reading I have proffered, together with the majority's\nrejection of it, leads me to conclude that the statutory\nlanguage is ambiguous. Once we have found an ambiguity\nin the statutory language, our resort to legislative history\nwould confirm that PACA is not intended to cover\nrestaurants and food service institutions. In discussing the\ndefinition of \"retailer\" (which relies in part on the definition\nof dealer), the House Report made clear that food service\nestablishments such as restaurants or schools, hospitals,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The majority relies by analogy upon the Kelley case, which found\nthat the Packers and Stockyards Act did not require a dealer to be\nengaged solely in the business of selling livestock. See Kelley v. United\nStates, 202 F.2d 838 (10th Cir. 1953). This analogy is inapposite. In\nKelley, the livestock dealer was clearly engaged in the business of\nselling\n\nlivestock. Kelley was a proprietor of a stockyard that, because it was\nprivate, was not itself subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act. See id.\nat 839. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that, by buying\nlivestock from stockyards that were subject to the Act, Kelley became a\n\"dealer\" subject to the registration and bond requirements of the Act. See\nid. at 841. That is, the issue in Kelley was whether the livestock dealer\nhad to be registered when his dealing in livestock subject to the Act was\nnot his sole business due to the fact that his sales of other livestock\nmight predominate. There is no question that the core of Kelley's\nbusiness was dealing livestock, and this clearly distinguishes his case\n\ffrom the instant case where Magic's business is not dealing in produce.\n\n                                17\n\n\nand other institutional cafeterias are not required to be\nlicensed. The agency's construction of PACA is consistent\nwith this position.11 In short, dealers and brokers are those\nwhose business is in dealing in, or brokering, these items.\nThey should be licensed and are subject to the Act. Magic\nis engaged in a very different business, and is not in my\nview subject to regulation as a \"dealer\" under PACA.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11.

S 499a et seq. (\"PACA\"), and\ntherefore subject to its trust provision, 7 U.S.C.S 499e(c).\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\nDelaware held that they are, and subsequently granted\npartial summary judgment in favor of the Appellant. The\nUnited States District Court reversed. We hold that\nrestaurants are dealers under the plain language of PACA,\nand we therefore reverse the order of the district court and\nreinstate the order of the bankruptcy court.\n\n                                  2\n\n\nI.\n\nOn April 6, 1995, Magic Restaurants, Inc. and Magic\nAmerican Cafe, Inc. (collectively \"Magic\")filed voluntary\nbankruptcy petitions in the bankruptcy court for\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nMagic, directly or through its subsidiaries, owned and\noperated fifteen restaurants in the Washington, D.C. and\nNew York City metropolitan areas. These restaurants\ngenerated $20 million in sales revenues in a six month\nperiod in 1995-96. Magic purchased fresh fruits and\nvegetables from Bowie Produce Co., Inc. (\"Bowie\"), which it\nprocessed into food items, including salads or hamburger\ntrimmings, and sold to its restaurant customers. At the\ntime Magic filed for bankruptcy in April 1995, it owed\nBowie $98,983.74 for these produce purchases.\n\fBowie commenced an adversarial proceeding in the\nbankruptcy court to recover full payment from Magic on the\nground that the proceeds from the produce Magic had\npurchased were trust funds under Section 5(c) of PACA, 7\nU.S.C. S 499e(c). Magic moved for summary judgment on\nthe ground that as a restaurant, it was not a \"dealer,\" and\nwas therefore not subject to PACA's trust provision. By\nmemorandum opinion and order dated June 18, 1996, the\nbankruptcy court denied Magic's motion and held that\nMagic was a \"dealer\" under the plain language of PACA. On\nJanuary 15, 1997, the bankruptcy court granted partial\nsummary judgment for Bowie, awarding it $93,173.29 in\ntrust proceeds.\n\nMagic appealed the bankruptcy court's ruling to the\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 158(a). The district\ncourt reversed the bankruptcy court by memorandum\nopinion and order dated January 6, 1999, holding that\nMagic was not a \"dealer\" under PACA and therefore was not\nsubject to its trust provision. This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\nA. Statutory Background.\n\nCongress enacted PACA in 1930 \"to promote fair trading\npractices in the marketing of perishable agricultural\n\n\n                               3\n\n\ncommodities, largely fruits and vegetables.\" Consumers\nProduce Co., Inc. v. Volante Wholesale Produce, Inc. , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663701\"><a href=\"/opinion/663701/consumers-produce-co-inc-of-pittsburgh-and-golden-triangle-packing/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377-78 (3d Cir. 1994). PACA was \" `designed\nprimarily for the protection of the producers of perishable\nagricultural products -- most of whom must entrust their\nproducts to a buyer or commission merchant who may be\nthousands of miles away, and depend for their payment\nupon his business acumen and fair dealing.' \" In re\nKornblum & Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716603\"><a href=\"/opinion/716603/in-re-kornblum-co-inc-debtor-tom-lange-co-inc-and-scott-finks/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1196, at 2 (1955), reprinted in 1956\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3699, 3701). Producers of perishable\nagricultural goods are in large part dependent upon the\nhonesty and scrupulousness of the purchaser or consignee\nwho geographically may be far removed. To provide\nproducers with some protection, Congress fortified the\noriginal PACA with two primary weapons. First, it\nprohibited certain conduct by \"commission merchants,\"\n\"brokers,\" or \"dealers.\" 7 U.S.C. S 499b. Failure to abide by\nthese prohibitions rendered the \"commission merchant,\ndealer, or broker . . . liable to the person or persons injured\nthereby for the full amount of damages . . . sustained in\n\fconsequence of such violation.\" Id. SS 499e(a) & 499e(b).\nSecond, PACA established a mandatory licensing scheme,\nunder the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture, for\nany \"person\" carrying on \"the business of a commission\nmerchant, dealer, or broker.\" Id.

Even with the passage of a half-century\nafter its initial enactment, Congress, in 1984, determined\nthat prevalent financing practices in the perishable\nagricultural commodities industry were placing the industry\nas a whole, including produce sellers, in jeopardy. It\nresponded by amending PACA, explaining:\n\n                               4\n\n\n       It is hereby found that a burden on commerce in\n       perishable agricultural commodities is caused by\n       financing arrangements under which commission\n\n       merchants, dealers, or brokers, who have not made\n       payment for perishable agricultural commodities\n       purchased, contracted to be purchased, or otherwise\n       handled by them on behalf of another person,\n       encumber or give lenders a security interest in, such\n       commodities, or on inventories of food or other\n       products derived from such commodities, and any\n       receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, and that such arrangements\n       are contrary to the public interest. . . .\n\n7 U.S.C.

The legislative history of the 1984 PACA amendments further explains\nthe problem Congress intended to address:\n\n        Sellers of agricultural commodities are often located thousands of\n       miles from their customers. Sales transactions must be made\n\f       quickly or they are not made at all . . . . Under such conditions,\nit\n       is often difficult to make credit checks, conditional sales\n       agreements, and take other traditional safeguards.\n\n       * * *\n\n        Many [buyers], in the ordinary course of their business\n       transactions, operate on bank loans secured by [their] inventories,\n       proceeds or assigned receivables from sales of perishable\n       agricultural commodities, giving the lender a secured position in\nthe\n       case of insolvency. Under present law, sellers of fresh fruits and\n       vegetables are unsecured creditors and receive little protection in\n       any suit for recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make\n       payment as required by the contract.\n\n        In recent years, produce sellers have been subjected to increased\n       instances of buyers failure to pay and slow payments.\n\nH.R.

The District Court's Decision.\n\nBowie's appeal hinges on its contention that Magic is a\n\"dealer\" under PACA.3 If Bowie is correct, it has priority to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f2. The trust provision states, in relevant part:\n\n       Perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission\n       merchant, dealer, or broker in all transactions, and all\ninventories\n\n       of food or other products derived from perishable agricultural\n       commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, shall be held by such commission\n       merchant, dealer, or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid\n       suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the\n       transaction, until full payment of the sums owing in connection\nwith\n\n       such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,\n       sellers, or agents. . . .\n\n7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(2).\n\n3. Bowie did not contend in the bankruptcy court or the district court\nand does not contend now that Magic is a \"commission merchant\" or a\n\"broker.\"\n\n                               6\n\n\ncertain of Magic's assets as the beneficiary of PACA's\nstatutorily imposed trust. PACA defines the term\"dealer\" as\n\"any person engaged in the business of buying or selling in\nwholesale or jobbing quantities, as defined by the\nSecretary, any perishable agricultural commodity in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . .\" 7 U.S.C.S 499a(b)(6).\nPACA also provides three exceptions to this definition:\n\n       (A) no producer shall be considered as a \"deale r\" in\n       respect to sales of any such commodity of his own\n       raising;\n\n       (B) no person buying any such commodity solely for\n       sale at retail shall be considered as a \"dealer\" until the\n       invoice cost of his purchases of perishable agricultural\n       commodities in any calendar year are in excess of\n       $230,000; and\n\n       (C) no person buying any commodity other than\n       potatoes for canning and/or processing within the\n       State where grown shall be considered a \"dealer\"\n       whether or not the canned or processed product is to\n       be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce, unless\n       such product is frozen or packed in ice, or consists of\n       cherries in brine . . . .\n\fId. Finally, this provision notes that \"[a]ny person not\nconsidered as a `dealer' under clauses (A), (B), and (C) may\nelect to secure a license under the provisions of section\n499c of this title, and in such case and while the license is\nin effect such person shall be considered as a `dealer'.\"\nMagic has never secured such a license, and contends that\nno restaurant has done so.\n\nThe parties do not dispute that Magic purchases\n\"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" of perishable agricultural\ncommodities in interstate commerce.4 Bowie therefore\ncontends that, based on the plain language of the statute,\nMagic is a \"dealer\" and is subject to the trust. The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of\nAgriculture (\"USDA\") define \"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" as\n\"aggregate quantities of all types of produce totaling one ton (2,000\npounds) or more in weight in any day shipped, received, or contracted to\nbe shipped or received.\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(x).\n\n                               7\n\n\nbankruptcy court agreed, but the district court reversed.\nThe court held that PACA \"is silent on the issue of whether\nrestaurants qualify as `dealers,' \" and therefore, \"Congress\nhas not spoken directly to the issue of PACA's applicability\nto restaurants.\" (A.7). Thus, the district court proceeded to\nconsider regulations promulgated by the USDA under its\nauthority to administer PACA. See 7 U.S.C.S 499o.\n\nThese USDA regulations define \"dealer\" as:\n\n       any person engaged in the business of buying or selling\n       in wholesale or jobbing quantities in commerce and\n       includes:\n\n        (1) Jobbers, distributors and other wholesaler s;\n\n        (2) Retailers, when the invoice cost of all pu rchases\n       of produce exceeds $230,000 during a calendar year.\n       In computing dollar volume, all purchases of fresh and\n       frozen fruits and vegetables are to be counted, without\n       regard to quantity involved in a transaction or whether\n       the transaction was intrastate, interstate or foreign\n       commerce;\n\n        (3) Growers who market produce grown by others.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.2(m). The district court concluded that under\nthis regulation, in order to be a \"dealer\" an entity had to fall\ninto one of the categories enumerated in 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(m)(1), (2), or (3). The court determined that the only\n\fpossible category a restaurant such as Magic could fall into\nwas that of \"retailers\" under 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(m)(2), but\nconcluded that restaurants such as Magic were consumers,\nnot retailers. Accordingly, the district court held that under\nthis USDA regulation, Magic was not a dealer.\n\nThe court found support for this conclusion in two\nadditional sources. First, in 1996, USDA amended its\nregulatory definition of \"fresh fruits and vegetables,\" 7\nC.F.R. S 46.2(u), to include oil-blanched frozen fruits and\nvegetables, thereby bringing such produce within PACA's\nreach. In its statement accompanying publication of the\nfinal rule, USDA described a comment it received from a\nrepresentative of a major restaurant chain voicing its\nconcern that the rule change \"might bring restaurants\nunder the jurisdiction of the PACA.\" Final Rule,\n\n                               8\n\n\n\"Regulations (Other Than Rules of Practice) Under the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (PACA),\" 61\nFed. Reg. 13385, 13386 (Mar. 27, 1996). USDA responded:\n\n       Restaurants traditionally have not been considered\n       subject to the PACA by USDA or Congress unless the\n       buying arm of the restaurant is a separate legal entity,\n       and is buying for and/or reselling the product to\n       another entity. Since restaurants are not subject to the\n       PACA, this change in the regulation will not impact\n       restaurants.\n\nId.\n\nSecond, in 1995, Congress amended PACA. These\namendments had no bearing on who was and was not\ncovered by the statute.5 In the report of the House\nCommittee on Agriculture accompanying the 1995 PACA\nAmendments Act, the Committee explained that:\n\n       Section 3 phases out license fees for retailers and\n       grocery wholesalers. It defines the term \"retailer\" as a\n       person who is a dealer engaged in the business of\n       selling any perishable commodity at retail.\n       Approximately 4,000 retailers are currently estimated\n       to be licensed under PACA. Those businesses such as\n       grocery stores and other like businesses that\n       predominantly serve those consumers purchasing food\n       for consumption at home or off the premises of the\n       retail establishment are considered to be included in\n       the definition of retailer. It is not the intent of the\n       Committee that the definition of retailer be construed\n       to include foodservice establishments such as\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f5. Essentially, the 1995 amendments phased retailers and grocery\nwholesalers out of license fee payment, allowed USDA to adjust license\nfees under its rulemaking authority, \"require[d] USDA to receive a\nwritten complaint before pursuing an investigation, require[d] additional\nUSDA investigation notification procedures, increase[d] . . .\nadministrative penalties, establishe[d] civil penalties, clarifie[d] the\nstatus\nof collateral fees and expenses, and clarifie[d] misbranding prohibitions\n. . . .\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-207, at 6 (1995), reprinted in 1995\nU.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n453, 453. Other than these changes, the House Committee on\nAgriculture explained, the law remained unaffected.

No. 104-207, at 7 (1995), reprinted in   1995\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 453, 454.\n\nAccordingly, based on this regulatory interpretation and\nlegislative history, the district court held that restaurants\nsuch as Magic are not \"dealers\" and are therefore not\nsubject to PACA's trust provision.\n\nIII.\n\nThe question of whether a restaurant with extensive\noperations such as Magic is a \"dealer\" under PACA is a\npurely legal determination. Accordingly, this court exercises\nplenary review over the judgment of the district court.

W.D. Pa. 1997), the bankruptcy court, like\nthe district court in this case, held that PACA's definition of\n\"dealer\" is ambiguous, that the USDA regulation defining\n\"dealer\" did so to the exclusion of anyone not expressly\ndescribed by the regulation, and that the restaurant debtor\nin that case was not a retailer under this regulation and\ntherefore not subject to PACA's trust provision. The Italian\nOven court considered and expressly rejected the reasoning\nof the bankruptcy court in this case. Id. at 842-43.6\n\nAs noted above, USDA, the agency charged with\nadministering PACA, has indicated its view that restaurants\nare not \"dealers\" under that statute. Indeed, that agency's\nconsistent practice for seven decades since PACA's\nenactment has been to deny that the statute gives it\njurisdiction over restaurants.7 Nevertheless, \"a reviewing\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. It gave three reasons in support of its holding that PACA's definition\nof \"dealer\" was ambiguous and resort to administrative materials was\nappropriate. The first reason was that prior to the bankruptcy court's\ndecision in this case, there had been no reported decisions dealing with\nwhether PACA applies to restaurants, even though the statute had been\nin existence since 1930. Id. at 843. The court's second reason is\nconfusing, but appears to have had something to do with PACA's silence\nas to its applicability to restaurants. Id. The third reason was that PACA\nempowered the USDA to administer the statute by enacting regulations.\nId. at 843-44. For the same reasons discussed herein, the Italian Oven\ncourt's first two reasons for looking beyond the plain statutory\ndefinition\n\nof \"dealer\" are unconvincing to us. Additionally, its third reason is\nirrelevant to an inquiry into the ambiguity of statutory text.\n\n7. This practice is further evidenced by USDA's communications with\nMagic. A July 6, 1995 letter to counsel for Magic from a USDA official\napparently responsible for license and program review in the PACA\n\fBranch of USDA's Fruit and Vegetable Division explained that official's\nview that \"[r]estaurants are not considered`dealers,' `brokers,'\n`commission merchants' or any other entity whose operations are subject\nto the PACA,\" and that \"[t]he PACA is not applicable to a restaurant that\ndoes not act as a central distributor for subsidiary restaurants\nirrespective of where it obtains it perishable commodities.\" (A.16).\n\n                               11\n\n\ncourt should not defer to an agency position which is\ncontrary to an intent of Congress expressed in\nunambiguous terms.\" Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112776\"><a href=\"/opinion/112776/estate-of-cowart-v-nicklos-drilling-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 (1992).\n\nUltimately, this case turns on whether the statutory\ndefinition of \"dealer\" found in PACA is unambiguous with\nrespect to its inclusion of restaurants such as Magic. As\ndiscussed above, PACA states that subject to certain\nexceptions, a dealer is \"any person engaged in the business\nof buying or selling in wholesale or jobbing quantities, as\ndefined by the Secretary, any perishable agricultural\ncommodity in interstate or foreign commerce . . . .\" 7 U.S.C.\nS 499a(b)(6). Because \"the term `person' includes\nindividuals, partnerships, corporations, and associations,\"\nid. S 499a(b)(1), Magic is a \"person\" under PACA.\nFurthermore, the parties do not dispute that Magic\npurchased \"wholesale or jobbing quantities\" of produce,\nwhich USDA regulations define as \"aggregate quantities of\nall types of produce totaling one ton (2,000 pounds) or more\nin weight in any day shipped, received, or contracted to be\nshipped or received.\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(x). Additionally, Magic\ndoes not contend that it falls within any of the three\nstatutory exceptions to PACA's definition of \"dealer.\" See 7\nU.S.C. S 499a(b)(6)(A), (B), and (C).\n\nAt oral argument in this case, it was suggested that\nCongress's employment of the words \"engaged in the\nbusiness of \" in defining the category of\"dealers\" rendered\nthis definition ambiguous, because this language could be\ninterpreted to restrict the meaning of \"dealer\" to include\nonly those engaged primarily in the business of buying or\nselling perishable agricultural commodities. However,\nnothing about the ordinary meaning of the words\"engaged\"\nor \"business\" indicates that the statutory definition should\nbe understood to apply only to those engaged primarily in\nthis business. This \"engaged in the business of \" language\nspeaks to the type of business required to invoke\njurisdiction under PACA, not to the quantity thereof.\nCongress spoke to quantity later in this definition, when it\n\n                               12\n\frestricted the category of \"dealers\" to those doing business\n\"in wholesale or jobbing quantities.\"8\n\nThere is therefore nothing ambiguous about the\napplication of this statutory definition to the facts of this\ncase. The district court's conclusion that the definition is\nambiguous because it does not explicitly state whether\nrestaurants are dealers is specious. Because Congress\nchose to define the word \"dealer\" in broad terms, rather\nthan by specifically identifying each entity that falls into\nthis category, does not automatically render the definition\nambiguous.\n\nB. The Statutory Purpose.\n\nEven where the express language of a statute appears\nunambiguous, a court must look beyond that plain\nlanguage where a literal interpretation of this language\nwould thwart the purpose of the overall statutory scheme,\nUnited States v. Jersey Shore Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463484\"><a href=\"/opinion/463484/united-states-v-jersey-shore-state-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977 (3d\nCir. 1986), aff 'd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111791\"><a href=\"/opinion/111791/jersey-shore-state-bank-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), would lead to an\nabsurd result, id., or would otherwise produce a result\n\"demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters,\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The interpretation given to the definition of \"dealer\" in the Packers\nand\nStockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. S 181 et seq. (\"PSA\"), lends additional support\nto this conclusion. PACA's trust provision was modeled on that of the\nPSA, and this court has previously observed that authority developed\nunder the PSA is persuasive in interpreting PACA's trust. See Consumers\nProduce, 16 F.3d at 1382 n.5. Using language nearly identical to that\nused in PACA, the PSA defines a \"dealer\" as\"any person . . . engaged in\nthe business of buying or selling in commerce livestock at a stockyard\n. . . .\" Id.

Indeed, the only such evidence\nof legislative intent is the statement contained in the 1995\nHouse Agriculture Committee report that the Committee did\nnot intend that restaurants be included within the\ndefinition of \"retailers\" enacted in the 1995 PACA\nAmendments Act. That statement, however, is confined to\nthe amendment. This committee report was issued more\nthan 30 years after the last time Congress modified the\ndefinition of \"dealer\" in any substantial way,9 and dealt with\nissues wholly different from this definition. See supra note\n6. This report language is not something \"upon which other\nlegislators might have relied in voting for or against\" the\nstatutory definition of \"dealer,\" and cannot constitute\nevidence of the legislative intent behind that definition.

We therefore disregard this\nHouse committee report.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Pub L. No. 87-725, 1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2749, substituted \"wholesale or\njobbing quantities\" for \"carloads.\" Amendments in 1969, 1978, and 1981\nincrease the monetary amount under current section 499a(b)(6)(B) from\n$90,000 to $100,000, $100,000 to $200,000, and $200,000 to $230,000,\nrespectively. See Pub. L. No. 97-98, 1981 U.S.C.C.A.N. (95 Stat.) 1213,\n1269; Pub. L. No. 95-562, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 2381; Pub. L. No.\n91-107, 1969 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1225. In addition, the 1978 amendment\ninserted \"other than potatoes\" after \"commodity\" in current section\n499a(b)(6)(C). See Pub L. No. 95-562, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 2381.\n\n                               14\n\n\nMoreover, requiring restaurants that purchase large\nquantities of produce to comply with PACA furthers the\ngoals of the statute as amended in 1984. Although the\noriginal PACA was enacted to protect produce growers and\nproducers, the 1984 amendments, including the trust\nprovision, were enacted for the protection of all produce\nsellers and suppliers. Holding restaurant-purchasers\nresponsible to produce sellers such as Bowie provides\n\fprotection of produce suppliers up through the distribution\nchain and therefore furthers the purposes of the trust\nprovision.\n\nMagic contends that if this court holds that restaurants\nare \"dealers,\" and therefore subject to PACA, the\nrepercussions would be \"staggering\" because\"all of the\nhundreds of thousands of restaurants in this country\" that\nhave never applied for licenses under PACA \"have been in\ndirect violation of federal law, for decades.\" (Appellee's Br.\nat 18-19). To some extent, Magic may have a point. Under\nPACA, any person failing to obtain a license through\ninadvertence rather than wilfulness may \"be permitted by\nthe Secretary . . . to settle his liability in the matter by the\npayment of fees due for the period covered by such violation\nand an additional sum, not in excess of $250, to befixed by\nthe Secretary . . . .\" 7 U.S.C. 499c(b). Should the Secretary\nchoose to pursue such violations, these licensing fees could\nadd up to substantial amounts over the 70-year period in\nwhich PACA has been in force.\n\nIt is not clear how many restaurants actually purchase\nproduce in \"wholesale or jobbing quantities,\" and are\ntherefore subject to PACA's licensing requirement. The\nparties have offered no evidence on this point. We suspect,\nhowever, that the number of restaurants that do so is far\nsmaller than Magic contends. In addition, we would be very\nsurprised if the Secretary chose to pursue enforcement of\nsuch violations retroactively. Even if the Secretary does\nattempt to enforce PACA's penalty provisions against these\n\"violating\" restaurants, the long history of non-enforcement\nagainst restaurants in this case may be sufficiently\nextraordinary as to permit restaurants to successfully argue\nthe application of equitable estoppel or laches.\n\n                                15\n\n\nWe recognize that the USDA has refused to exercise\njurisdiction over restaurants pursuant to PACA for\napproximately seven decades. It is this benign neglect that\nis responsible for much of the confusion in this area.\nNevertheless, we are constrained by PACA's unambiguous\nstatutory language to hold that a restaurant such as Magic,\nwhich purchases produce in wholesale or jobbing quantities\n(and in excess of $230,000 per year), is a \"dealer\" under 7\nU.S.C. S 499a(b)(6), and administrative interpretations\ncontrary to this plain language are therefore not persuasive.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the January 6, 1999 order of\nthe district court will be reversed, and the case remanded\nto the district court with instructions to reinstate the\n\fJanuary 15, 1997 order of the bankruptcy court granting\npartial summary judgment in favor of Bowie. Each side to\nbear its own costs.\n\n                               16\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI respectfully dissent because I find the phrase\"engaged\nin the business of buying or selling . . .\" to be susceptible\nof a different meaning from that given it by the majority.\n\nRestaurants are engaged in the business of preparing\nand selling meals to customers. Not only is buying or\nselling perishables in large quantities not their primary\nbusiness, it is not their business at all. 10 Admittedly, in the\ncourse of their business, they do buy perishables in great\nquantities. If PACA was intended to include them, Congress\nshould have said, \"any business that buys or sells . . .\"; it\ndid not. As I read the statute, it confines the concept of\n\"dealer\" to those who do this as their bread and butter, so\nto speak. The majority reading would make most prisons\n\"dealers,\" yet prisons are not engaged in the perishable\ncommodity-buying business.\n\nThe reading I have proffered, together with the majority's\nrejection of it, leads me to conclude that the statutory\nlanguage is ambiguous. Once we have found an ambiguity\nin the statutory language, our resort to legislative history\nwould confirm that PACA is not intended to cover\nrestaurants and food service institutions. In discussing the\ndefinition of \"retailer\" (which relies in part on the definition\nof dealer), the House Report made clear that food service\nestablishments such as restaurants or schools, hospitals,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The majority relies by analogy upon the Kelley case, which found\nthat the Packers and Stockyards Act did not require a dealer to be\nengaged solely in the business of selling livestock. See Kelley v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"231306\"><a href=\"/opinion/231306/kelley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1953). This analogy is inapposite. In\nKelley, the livestock dealer was clearly engaged in the business of\nselling\n\nlivestock. Kelley was a proprietor of a stockyard that, because it was\nprivate, was not itself subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act. See id.\nat 839. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that, by buying\nlivestock from stockyards that were subject to the Act, Kelley became a\n\"dealer\" subject to the registration and bond requirements of the Act. See\nid. at 841. That is, the issue in Kelley was whether the livestock dealer\nhad to be registered when his dealing in livestock subject to the Act was\nnot his sole business due to the fact that his sales of other livestock\nmight predominate. There is no question that the core of Kelley's\nbusiness was dealing livestock, and this clearly distinguishes his case\n\ffrom the instant case where Magic's business is not dealing in produce.\n\n                                17\n\n\nand other institutional cafeterias are not required to be\nlicensed. The agency's construction of PACA is consistent\nwith this position.11 In short, dealers and brokers are those\nwhose business is in dealing in, or brokering, these items.\nThey should be licensed and are subject to the Act. Magic\nis engaged in a very different business, and is not in my\nview subject to regulation as a \"dealer\" under PACA.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11.
