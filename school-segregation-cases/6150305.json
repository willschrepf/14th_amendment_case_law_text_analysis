Hardie, who is\nAfrican American, alleges that the NCAA’s policy of\nexcluding anyone with a felony conviction from coaching at\nNCAA-certified youth athletic tournaments violates Title II\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a), which\nprohibits racial discrimination in places of public\naccommodation. Hardie’s suit rests on a disparate-impact\ntheory of Title II liability. We have never endorsed or\nrejected disparate-impact liability under Title II, and we\nneed not decide this issue today. We hold that even if\ndisparate-impact claims are cognizable under Title II, Hardie\nhas not shown that an equally effective, less discriminatory\nalternative to the NCAA’s felon-exclusion policy exists, as\nhe must do under the three-step analysis for disparate-impact\nclaims set forth in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,\n490 U.S. 642 (1989). We affirm summary judgment for the\nNCAA.\n\n                              I\n\n    The NCAA is a voluntary, unincorporated association of\nover 1,200 colleges and universities. One of the functions of\nthe NCAA is to develop rules that govern intercollegiate\nathletics, including rules that limit recruitment of student-\n\f6                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nathletes. As part of their recruitment activities, coaches and\nother athletics staff from NCAA member schools attend\nnonscholastic 1 youth athletic tournaments to scout potential\nrecruits. Under NCAA rules, coaches and recruiters from\nDivision I schools may attend nonscholastic tournaments\nonly if the tournaments have obtained certification from the\nNCAA to verify that they are in compliance with NCAA\nguidelines. Without such attendance, the chances that\nplayers might be scouted and later recruited to play for an\nNCAA school are significantly diminished. This in turn\naffects the willingness of teams to play in uncertified\ntournaments and the profitability of private sponsors who\norganize these events.\n\n    The NCAA’s guidelines impose a number of\nrequirements on tournament operators to ensure the safety of\nparticipants and preserve the integrity of college athletics\nrecruiting. The guidelines restrict the number of games\nathletes may play in, for example, and they mandate that\ntournament operators obtain insurance and hire medical\npersonnel. Importantly here, the guidelines require that\ntournament operators abide by the NCAA Participant\nApproval Policy. The Participant Approval Policy provides\nthat anyone seeking to coach at an NCAA-certified\nnonscholastic tournament must submit to a criminal\nbackground check. Under the current version of the policy,\nanyone who has been convicted of a felony is automatically\ndenied approval to coach in an NCAA-certified tournament.\nIf a tournament operator fails to comply with NCAA\nguidelines, including the Participant Approval Policy, the\ntournament will not receive NCAA certification, and NCAA\n\n\n     1\n        Nonscholastic tournaments are tournaments in which the\nparticipating teams are unaffiliated with schools.\n\f                        HARDIE V. NCAA                             7\n\nDivision I coaches and recruiters may not attend the\nuncertified tournament to scout for new talent.\n\n    The NCAA did not always ban anyone with a felony\nconviction from coaching at certified tournaments. The first\nParticipant Approval Policy governing women’s basketball,\nadopted in 2006, disqualified only prospective coaches who\nhad been convicted of a violent felony, 2 a sex offense, a\ncrime involving children, or a nonviolent felony if the\nnonviolent felony conviction was less than seven years old.\nThe NCAA asserts, however, that the 2006 policy caused\nsafety concerns and administrative difficulties. Certain\ncrimes classified as nonviolent, including financial crimes,\nsports bribery, and possession of controlled substances,\nnonetheless raised significant safety and ethical concerns\nabout    coaches     interacting    with    student-athletes.\nAdditionally, differences between states’ classification of\nthe same crimes led to inconsistent outcomes with respect to\nwho was approved as a tournament coach and who was not.\n\n    In light of these challenges, the NCAA amended the\nParticipant Approval Policy in 2011 to eliminate the violent-\nnonviolent felony distinction. Now, anyone with a felony\nconviction, no matter how old, is denied entry approval to\ncoach. Any prior sex offense conviction, regardless of the\ncharge level, and “active criminal cases” are also\ndisqualifying. Coaches approved under the Participant\nApproval Policy may coach at NCAA-certified tournaments\nfor two years, and then must reapply.\n\n    In conformance with the amended Participant Approval\nPolicy, Dominic Hardie was denied approval to coach at the\n\n    2\n      The NCAA defined “violent felonies” as crimes committed against\na person and punishable by at least one year in prison.\n\f8                       HARDIE V. NCAA\n\n2013 MidSummer Night’s Madness Western Tournament,\nan annual NCAA-certified girls’ basketball tournament in\nSan Diego. In 2001, Hardie had pled guilty and was\nconvicted for possession of a controlled substance (cocaine),\na felony in Texas. Hardie’s felony conviction had not\naffected his ability to coach in NCAA-certified tournaments\nbefore the Participant Approval Policy was amended. Under\nthe pre-2011 version of the policy, Hardie had been able to\ncoach because his only conviction was over seven years old\nand was for a nonviolent felony. But in 2012, when Hardie’s\ncoaching approval expired and he reapplied, he was barred\nfrom coaching under the amended policy banning all felons.\nHardie was allowed to attend the 2013 MidSummer Night’s\nMadness tournament as a spectator, but he could not\nparticipate from the coaches’ bench. Hardie alleges this\nprevented him from having personal contact with the\nstudent-athletes he coaches during the tournament games,\nwhich negatively affected his team members’ performance\nand opportunities to earn college athletics scholarships to\nNCAA schools.\n\n    After exhausting his administrative remedies without\nobtaining approval to coach, Hardie sued the NCAA in\nfederal district court to enjoin enforcement of the Participant\nApproval Policy. 3 Hardie alleges that the Participant\nApproval Policy violates Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a), by denying him the full and\n\n    3\n      Hardie’s First Amended Complaint also named the operator of the\nMidSummer Night’s Madness tournament, the International Girls\nBasketball Organization (IGBO), and the owners of the tournament\nvenues, Alliant International University and Town and Country Hotel,\nLLC, as defendants. Hardie later jointly agreed to dismiss his claims\nagainst these defendants.\n\f                           HARDIE V. NCAA                                   9\n\nequal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.4\nOriginally, Hardie advanced both disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact theories of Title II liability; on appeal, he\nnow pursues only a disparate-impact theory. To prevail on\nhis claim, Hardie must prove that the Participant Approval\nPolicy has a “‘disproportionately adverse effect on\nminorities’ and [is] otherwise unjustified by a legitimate\nrationale.” See Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v.\nInclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2513 (2015)\n(quoting Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009)). He\nneed not show that the NCAA acted with a “discriminatory\nintent or motive.” See id. Hardie alleges that “[t]he NCAA’s\ncategorical bar” on coaches with felony convictions “falls\ndisproportionately on African Americans like Hardie, who\nare more than three times as likely as white Americans to\nhave suffered a felony conviction.”\n\n    To prove the Participant Approval Policy’s disparate\nimpact, Hardie offers a report prepared by economist Marc\nBendick. Bendick surveyed 541 applicants who sought\nparticipant approval to coach at NCAA-certified\n\n     4\n       Title II provides that “[a]ll persons shall be entitled to the full and\nequal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,\nand accommodations of any place of public accommodation . . . without\ndiscrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or\nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a). “Public accommodations”\ninclude, among other things, “sports arena[s], stadium[s] or other\nplace[s] of exhibition or entertainment,” so long as their “operations\naffect commerce, or if discrimination or segregation by it is supported\nby State action.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(b). The NCAA does not dispute\nthat coaching in NCAA-certified athletic tournaments constitutes a\n“privilege” of a place of public accommodation. See Daniel v. Paul,\n395 U.S. 298, 306 (1969) (holding that Title II protects from\ndiscrimination “spectators,” “listeners,” and “those where entertainment\ntakes the form of direct participation in some sport or activity”).\n\f10                       HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nnonscholastic youth basketball tournaments between 2011\nand 2013. Among applicants surveyed, 46.5% of those\napproved under the Participant Approval Policy were\nAfrican American, while 80.1% of those denied because of\na felony conviction were African American. Bendick’s\nresults thus show that African American applicants “were\nrepresented among felony denied applicants at 1.72 times\ntheir representation among approved applicants.”            A\nsupplemental report Bendick prepared using “geocoding” 5\nproduced similar results. In the supplemental report, African\nAmerican applicants represented 40.3% of applicants denied\nbecause of a felony conviction, compared to 26.5% of\napproved applicants, meaning that African Americans were\nrepresented among felony-denied applicants at a rate 1.52\ntimes higher than among approved applicants. Bendick\nstates that the survey and geocoding results are statistically\nsignificant. 6\n\n    The NCAA moved for summary judgment on Hardie’s\nTitle II claim. The district court granted summary judgment\nfor the NCAA, concluding that disparate-impact claims are\nnot cognizable under Title II. Hardie timely appealed. We\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       “Geocoding” involves using U.S. Census Bureau data to predict\nthe race of applicants based on their home addresses. In his supplemental\nreport, Bendick used geocoding to predict the race of 1,105 applicants\nusing home addresses provided by the NCAA.\n     6\n      Bendick undertook these data-gathering efforts because the NCAA\ndid not itself collect information on the race of applicants for coaching\napproval.\n\f                         HARDIE V. NCAA                              11\n\n                                  II\n\n    “We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo, and may affirm on any basis supported by the\nrecord.” Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 575 F.3d 1040, 1047\n(9th Cir. 2009). On review of a grant of summary judgment,\nwe “must determine, viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any\ngenuine issues of material fact and whether the district court\ncorrectly applied the relevant substantive law.” Szajer v.\nCity of Los Angeles, 632 F.3d 607, 610 (9th Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson,\n363 F.3d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir. 2004)).\n\n                                  III\n\n    On appeal, the NCAA does not challenge Hardie’s\nargument that Title II encompasses disparate-impact claims.\nInstead, the NCAA asks us to affirm entry of summary\njudgment in its favor on either of two other grounds\nadvanced below, assuming arguendo that disparate-impact\nclaims are cognizable under Title II. First, the NCAA\ncontends that it did not deny Hardie a privilege of a place of\npublic accommodation because tournament operators, not\nthe NCAA, enforce the Participant Approval Policy.\nSecond, the NCAA argues that Hardie has failed to meet his\nburden under Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio 7 of\nshowing in support of his disparate-impact claim that an\nequally effective, less discriminatory alternative to the\nfelony ban under the Participant Approval Policy exists. We\n\n\n    7\n      490 U.S. 642 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k), as recognized in Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty.\nAffairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2523 (2015).\n\f12                     HARDIE V. NCAA\n\naffirm summary judgment for the NCAA on the latter\nground.\n\n                                A\n\n    Neither the Supreme Court nor we have decided whether\ndisparate-impact claims are cognizable under Title II. A few\ncourts have found that Title II authorizes disparate-impact\nclaims, see Olzman v. Lake Hills Swim Club, Inc., 495 F.2d\n1333, 1341–42 (2d Cir. 1974); Robinson v. Power Pizza,\nInc., 993 F. Supp. 1462, 1464–66 (M.D. Fla. 1998), while\nothers have rejected disparate-impact liability under Title II,\nsee, e.g., Akiyama v. U.S. Judo Inc., 181 F. Supp. 2d 1179,\n1187 (W.D. Wash. 2002); LaRoche v. Denny’s, Inc., 62 F.\nSupp. 2d 1366, 1370 n.2 (S.D. Fla. 1999). Several courts\nhave declined to decide the issue altogether. See, e.g.,\nArguello v. Conoco, Inc., 207 F.3d 803, 813 (5th Cir. 2000);\nJefferson v. City of Fremont, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1145–46\n(N.D. Cal. 2014) (citing cases).\n\n    We express no view today on whether Title II\nencompasses disparate-impact claims. Even if Title II\nauthorized such claims, Hardie has not met his burden under\nWards Cove of showing that an equally effective, less\ndiscriminatory alternative to the Participant Approval Policy\nexists.\n\n                                 B\n\n    In Wards Cove, the Supreme Court laid out a burden-\nshifting framework that applies to disparate-impact claims. 8\n     8\n      The Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 105,\n105 Stat. 1071, 1074 (1991), abrogated Wards Cove with respect to\nclaims under Title VII, but the Supreme Court has continued to apply\nWards Cove burden shifting to other antidiscrimination statutes. See\n\f                        HARDIE V. NCAA                             13\n\n490 U.S. at 658. Burden shifting serves to limit disparate-\nimpact liability “in key respects that avoid the serious\nconstitutional questions that might arise . . . if such liability\nwere imposed based solely on a showing of statistical\ndisparities.” Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. Disparate-\nimpact liability may only condemn practices or policies that\nare “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary.” Id. at 2524\n(internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting Griggs v. Duke\nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971)). The parties here\nagree that, assuming Title II encompasses disparate-impact\nclaims, the Wards Cove framework would apply to Hardie’s\nclaim.\n\n    Wards Cove burden shifting proceeds in three steps.\nFirst, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case that the\ndefendant’s challenged policy or practice has a\n“significantly disparate impact on nonwhites.” Wards Cove,\n490 U.S. at 658. At the prima facie stage, the plaintiff must\npoint to “the application of a specific or particular . . .\npractice that has created the disparate impact under attack.”\nId. at 657. This “robust causality requirement ensures that\n‘[r]acial imbalance . . . does not, without more, establish a\nprima facie case of disparate impact’ and thus protects\ndefendants from being held liable for racial disparities they\ndid not create.” Inclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2523 (quoting\nWards Cove, 490 U.S. at 653).\n\n    Next, if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, “the case\nwill shift to any business justification [defendants] offer for\ntheir use of these practices.” Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 658.\n“This phase of the disparate-impact case contains two\ncomponents: first, a consideration of the justifications [a\n\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 240 (2005) (applying the Wards\nCove framework to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).\n\f14                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\ndefendant] offers for his use of these practices; and second,\nthe availability of alternative practices to achieve the same\n. . . ends, with less racial impact.” Id.\n\n    At the justification step of Wards Cove burden shifting,\nthe defendant must show that the “challenged practice\nserves, in a significant way, the legitimate . . . goals of the\n[defendant].” Id. at 659. The defendant’s practice need not\nbe “essential” or “indispensable” to achieving its stated goal,\nbut the relationship between the practice and its purpose\nmust be more than “insubstantial.” Id. While the defendant\nmust produce evidence that the practice serves legitimate\nends, “[t]he ultimate burden of proving that discrimination\nagainst a protected group has been caused by a specific . . .\npractice remains with the plaintiff at all times.” Id. (quoting\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Tr., 487 U.S. 977, 997\n(1988)).\n\n    Finally, if the defendant provides a legitimate\njustification for the challenged practice, the plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that an alternative practice (1) would “serve the\n[defendant’s] legitimate . . . interest[s],” and (2) would not\nhave a “similarly undesirable racial effect.” Id. at 660 (third\nalteration in the original) (internal quotation mark omitted)\n(quoting Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425\n(1975)). The plaintiff’s proposed alternative(s) must be\n“equally effective” as the defendant’s chosen policy at\nserving the defendant’s interest(s), taking into account\n“[f]actors such as the cost or other burdens” that alternative\npolicies would impose. Id. at 661 (alteration in original)\n(quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 998). A proposed alternative\nlacks a “similarly undesirable racial effect” if it results in\n“less disparate impact” compared to the challenged policy.\nInclusive Cmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2518; Ricci, 557 U.S. at 578.\nThis means plaintiffs must show not merely that an\n\f                         HARDIE V. NCAA                              15\n\nalternative policy would exclude fewer nonwhites, but that\nthe alternative would reduce the overall racial disparity\nbetween whites and nonwhites. In some circumstances, an\nalternative policy may exclude fewer nonwhites but, because\nmany more whites than nonwhites benefit under the\nalternative policy, the alternative actually exacerbates racial\ndisparities. Alternative policies that are less restrictive than\nthe challenged policy but do not result in “less disparate\nimpact” will not withstand scrutiny at step three. 9\n\n    Applying the Wards Cove framework here, Hardie relies\non the Bendick report to establish a prima facie case of\ndisparate impact. The Bendick report reveals that African\nAmericans were significantly overrepresented—by a factor\nof 1.52 to 1.72—among felony-denied applicants compared\nto approved applicants. The NCAA does not contest that\nBendick’s results represent a significant racial disparity, and\nwe agree. Furthermore, because Bendick surveyed only\ncoaches who sought approval after the amended Participant\nApproval Policy took effect, and because he identified\ncoaches who were denied specifically because of a prior\n\n    9\n      Hardie would have us frame the “less disparate impact” question\nsomewhat differently. He contends that, to satisfy this part of the third\nstep of the Wards Cove analysis, he would only need to show that\nprohibiting coaches with nonviolent felonies independently has a\ndisparate impact on African Americans. By Hardie’s logic, if people\nwith nonviolent felonies, a group that is disproportionately African\nAmerican, were allowed to coach, African Americans would\ndisproportionately benefit. We need not evaluate this argument. As\nexplained below, one of Hardie’s proposed alternatives—reverting to the\npre-2011 policy—falters on the “equally effective” prong of the third\nstep of the Wards Cove analysis, not the “less disparate impact” prong.\nAnd Hardie’s logic does not even apply to his other alternative—\nindividual assessments—because not all prospective coaches with\nnonviolent felonies would necessarily be allowed to coach under that\npolicy.\n\f16                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nfelony conviction, the Bendick report also establishes a\n“causal connection” between the Participant Approval\nPolicy’s blanket felon ban and the disproportionate effect on\nAfrican American coaching applicants. See Inclusive\nCmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2523.\n\n    At Wards Cove step two, the NCAA contends that the\nParticipant Approval Policy serves the NCAA’s interest in\n“protecting the safety of the children who participate in the\ntournaments and the integrity of the NCAA’s recruiting\nprocess and college athletics more generally.” For the most\npart, Hardie accepts that the NCAA’s proffered rationale for\nthe Participant Approval Policy is legitimate. We also agree.\n\n    The parties’ disagreement thus focuses on step three of\nthe Wards Cove analysis. To satisfy his burden at step three,\nHardie proposes two alternatives to the Participant Approval\nPolicy: (1) the NCAA could revert to the pre-2011 version\nof the policy, which disqualified applicants with violent but\nnot nonviolent felony convictions that were at least seven\nyears old; or (2) the NCAA could conduct individualized\nassessments of applicants with felony convictions to\ndetermine if they would pose an unacceptable risk to the\nsafety of tournament participants. We hold that Hardie has\nfailed to show that either of his proposed alternatives would\nbe both equally effective compared to, and less\ndiscriminatory than, the current policy. We address each of\nthese alternatives in turn.\n\n                              1\n\n    Hardie first proposes that the NCAA revert to the version\nof the Participant Approval Policy that was in effect before\n2011. The pre-2011 policy excluded applicants convicted of\na violent felony, a sex offense, or a crime involving children,\n\f                        HARDIE V. NCAA                            17\n\nno matter how old, or a nonviolent felony conviction if the\nconviction was less than seven years old.\n\n    We find Hardie has failed to establish that the pre-2011\npolicy would be equally effective as the current policy in\nserving the NCAA’s legitimate interests. Hardie contends\nthat the pre-2011 policy was proven equally effective\nbecause no documented safety incidents occurred during the\nfew years when that version of the policy was in force. But\nthe NCAA could have reasonably concluded that the level of\nrisk under the pre-2011 policy was unacceptable, even if no\ntournament participants had yet been harmed. Cf. El v. Se.\nPa. Transp. Auth., 479 F.3d 232, 244 (3d Cir. 2007) (“In a\nbroad sense, hiring policies . . . ultimately concern the\nmanagement of risk.”). Indeed, Hardie has not rebutted the\nNCAA’s assertion that under the pre-2011 policy, certain\nnonviolent felonies, such as financial crimes, possession of\ncontrolled substances, and sports bribery, posed\nunreasonable risks for the safety of student-athletes and the\nintegrity of the recruiting process.\n\n    To compare the relative effectiveness of the pre-2011\npolicy and the current policy, Hardie submits a report by Dr.\nKiminori Nakamura, a criminologist and expert on\nrecidivism. The Nakamura report concludes that the\nprobability that someone with a prior conviction will\nrecidivate decreases the longer that person goes without\ncommitting another crime. At some point, known as the\n“redemption time,” the risk that someone with a prior\nconviction will reoffend becomes equal to the risk of arrest\nfor the general population. 10 For people convicted of violent\ncrimes, the redemption time is four to seven years; for drug\n\n    10\n       The Nakamura report measures general population risk including\npeople with and without criminal histories.\n\f18                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nand property crimes, the redemption time is shortened to\nabout four years. Nakamura states that, because Hardie has\nnot committed another criminal offense since 2001, and\nbecause of his age, employment, and educational\nachievements, his risk of future arrest is in fact lower than\nthat of the general population.\n\n    For several reasons, the Nakamura report does not\nestablish that the pre-2011 Participant Approval Policy\noverall screens coaching applicants as effectively as the\ncurrent policy. First, it does not attempt to quantify and\ncompare the risk of future arrest for those permitted to coach\nunder the current Participant Approval Policy with the risk\nof those permitted under the pre-2011 version. Second,\nNakamura acknowledges that, even after many years have\npassed, the risk of future arrest for someone who has a\ncriminal record may remain higher than the risk of future\narrest for someone who has never been arrested. Hardie has\noffered no evidence to suggest that this difference in risk,\neven if small, is immaterial to achieving the NCAA’s\ninterests. Particularly considering that NCAA-approved\ncoaches work with minors, we cannot conclude on the record\nbefore us that this additional risk is insignificant.\n\n    We view this case as similar to El v. Southeastern\nPennsylvania Transportation Authority, 479 F.3d 232 (3d\nCir. 2007), in which the Third Circuit affirmed summary\njudgment for a local transit authority in a Title VII suit. Id.\nat 235. The transit authority in that case refused to hire\nanyone who had been convicted of a violent crime as a\nparatransit driver for disabled residents. In support of its\npolicy, the transit authority offered unrebutted evidence that,\neven after many years, people convicted of violent crimes\n“are at least somewhat more likely than members of the\ngeneral population to commit a future violent act.” Id. at\n\f                          HARDIE V. NCAA                               19\n\n246. The transit authority’s expert testified that, even if the\nadditional risk that a former violent felon posed “might be\nsmall,” “given the marked sensitivity of the paratransit\nposition at issue, a small but extant difference is sufficient”\nto justify the policy. Id. at 246–47. Analogizing to Hardie’s\nTitle II claim here, Hardie has offered no evidence to suggest\nthat the increased risk posed by coaches with prior felony\nconvictions, even if small, is immaterial to protecting the\nsafety of young athletes. Cf. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. v. Beazer,\n440 U.S. 568, 587 n.31 (1979) (holding that transit authority\nwas justified in refusing to hire methadone users for “safety-\nsensitive” positions). Nor does he offer evidence to address\nthe increased risk to preserving the integrity of college\nathletics from nonviolent crimes like sports bribery. 11\n\n    We must also note that reverting to the pre-2011 policy\nwould impose some increased administrative burden on the\nNCAA’s participant approval process.             The NCAA\nsubmitted evidence that the 2011 amendment to the\nParticipant Approval Policy was motivated in part by\nadministrative difficulties in distinguishing between violent\nand nonviolent crimes given states’ differing definitions of\nthe same offenses. While costs and other administrative\nburdens are only a “factor” in the equal effectiveness\nanalysis, see Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 661, and perhaps only\na small one in this case, the increased administrative burden\n\n\n    11\n       We do not mean to suggest that the small risk posed by individuals\nwith nonviolent felony convictions will always be material. In some\ncases, the risk presented by a felony conviction will be a generalized one,\nattenuated from the work of the organization in question. We are not\npresented with that situation here, though. In this context, where coaches\noften travel with, are responsible for, and have a great deal of influence\nover minors, and where certain crimes are particularly relevant to the\nintegrity of college athletics recruiting, the risk is material.\n\f20                   HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nhere is an additional factor that weighs slightly in the\nNCAA’s favor.\n\n    In sum, Hardie has not carried his burden at step three of\nthe Wards Cove framework with respect to this proposed\nalternative. He has not adduced sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that excluding\nviolent felons, but not nonviolent felons, from coaching\nwould be equally effective at achieving the NCAA’s goals\nas the current policy. While we recognize that the plaintiff’s\nburden at the alternatives stage is a demanding one, courts\nmust take caution before displacing reasonable business\njudgments. Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 661 (“Courts are\ngenerally less competent than employers to restructure\nbusiness practices.” (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v.\nWaters, 438 U.S. 567, 578 (1978))). Because we hold that\nHardie has failed to prove that the pre-2011 Participant\nApproval Policy would serve the NCAA’s legitimate\ninterests as effectively as the current policy, we need not\ndecide whether reverting to the pre-2011 policy would result\nin a lesser adverse racial effect.\n\n                              2\n\n    As a second alternative, Hardie proposes that the NCAA\nconduct individualized assessments of applicants with a\nfelony conviction to calculate the actual risks posed by an\napplicant. Hardie’s expert on human resources practices,\nLester S. Rosen, states that individualized assessments may\ntake into account factors such as “any mitigating\ncircumstance about the offense, the age of the offense, . . .\npast employment, educational achievements since the\noffense, and other signs of rehabilitation.”\n\n    Hardie’s individualized assessments alternative fails at\nstep three of the Wards Cove analysis, because he has put\n\f                     HARDIE V. NCAA                        21\n\nforward no evidence from which a reasonable jury could\nconclude that individualized assessments would have less\ndisparate impact than the current Participant Approval\nPolicy. None of Hardie’s experts analyze the expected racial\nimpact of individualized assessments using the criteria\nHardie proposes. The Rosen report only remarks generally\nthat “[t]here is widespread recognition that a policy of\nautomatically rejecting an applicant on the basis of a felony\nconviction, without any consideration of the offense, the\nposition in question, the age of the offense, and evidence of\nrehabilitation, is both unfair and potentially violates Civil\nRights laws.” Hardie also points to EEOC Guidelines that\nrecommend employers adopt individualized assessments as\na tool to avoid Title VII liability in the employment context.\nU.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, No. 915.002, EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance: Consideration of Arrest and\nConviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 18 (2012). Neither the\nRosen report nor the EEOC Guidelines analyze the racial\neffect of individualized assessments. Without more, we\ncannot say that Hardie has met his burden to show that\nindividualized assessments would be a less discriminatory\nalternative to the current Participant Approval Policy.\n\n    Because neither of Hardie’s proposed alternatives to the\nParticipant Approval Policy pass muster at the final stage of\nWards Cove burden shifting, the NCAA is entitled to\nsummary judgment.\n\n                              C\n\n    Alternatively, the NCAA urges us to affirm summary\njudgment on the ground that it has not actually denied Hardie\na “privilege[] . . . of [a] place of public accommodation,”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a), because tournament operators, rather\nthan the NCAA, actually enforce the Participant Approval\n\f22                       HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nPolicy. Because we find that Hardie failed to produce\nsufficient proof at step three of the Wards Cove analysis, we\nneed not reach this alternative basis for upholding summary\njudgment.\n\n                                   IV\n\n    We do not decide today whether Title II of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 encompasses disparate-impact claims.\nEven assuming arguendo that disparate-impact claims are\ncognizable under Title II, Hardie has not created a genuine\nissue of material fact that one of his proposed alternatives to\nthe NCAA’s Participant Approval Policy would be both\nequally effective and less discriminatory. The NCAA is\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFABER, District Judge, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment:\n\n    I agree with the Court that under Title II, Appellant\nDominic Hardie has not stated a cognizable claim. Yet the\nCourt skirts a key issue that this case squarely presents:\nWhether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under Title\nII.\n\n   In my view, Title II’s text does not recognize disparate-\nimpact liability, and we should clearly say so. 1 Title II\n     1\n        The Court’s statement that “the [National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation (‘NCAA’)] does not challenge Hardie’s argument that Title\nII encompasses disparate-impact claims,” Maj. op. at 11, tells only part\nof the story. True, the NCAA chooses to devote no part of its brief before\n\f                         HARDIE V. NCAA                              23\n\nrecognizes only disparate-treatment claims: claims\ninvolving intentional discrimination. Even if Title II did\nrecognize disparate-impact liability, the “business[-\n]necessity” defense, as the Court makes clear, requires us to\nreject Hardie’s claim. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs\nv. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2517\n(2015). Lastly, extraneous evidence such as human\nresources experts’, economists’ and criminologists’ reports\nis not helpful in determining what Title II requires. Such\nevidence is malleable and enables a court to adopt the result-\noriented expedient it prefers.\n\n   I. Title II’s Text Precludes Disparate-Impact Liability.\n\n    The text of Title II does not authorize disparate-impact\nliability, which typically flows from “practices that have a\n‘disproportionately adverse effect on minorities’ and are\notherwise unjustified by a legitimate rationale.” Inclusive\nCmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at 2513 (quoting Ricci v.\nDeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Under disparate-impact liability, “a\nfacially neutral . . . practice may be deemed [unlawfully\ndiscriminatory] without evidence of the [defendant’s]\nsubjective intent to discriminate that is required in a\n‘disparate-treatment’ case.” Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\n\n\nthis Court on that issue. However, the NCAA did raise it below,\nprevailed on that ground before the district court, and preserved that\nground for our consideration. In fact, the NCAA stated: “In light of the\nNCAA’s decision not to defend the district court’s reasoning, the Court\nmay deem it appropriate to appoint an amicus curiae to do so.” In other\nwords, the NCAA strategically chose to focus on the narrower reasons\nin its brief. However, amici Pacific Legal Foundation (“PLF”), the\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute (“CEI”), and the Center for Equal\nOpportunity (“CEO”) have argued most ably that Title II does not\nauthorize disparate-impact liability.\n\f24                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nAtonio, 490 U.S. 642, 645—46 (1989), superseded by statute\non other grounds, Civil Rights Act of 1991, §105, 105 Stat.\n1074—1075, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e—2(k) (1994 ed.).\n\n    42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a) (“Equal Access”), which is the\nrelevant Title II provision, states:\n\n       All persons shall be entitled to the full and\n       equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n       facilities, privileges, advantages, and\n       accommodations of any place of public\n       accommodation, as defined in this section,\n       without discrimination or segregation on the\n       ground of race, color, religion, or national\n       origin.\n\n    Title II imposes no liability on organizations based on an\nindividual’s exclusion from public places over which the\norganization did not have actual control, or at least some\nclose connection. In order to impose Title II liability, a court\nmust find that the defendant intentionally has engaged in\nracial discrimination in the enjoyment of public\naccommodations—also known as disparate treatment.\nHence, the defendant itself must have denied someone or\nwithheld from someone a privilege of a public\naccommodation or, at a bare minimum, have a concrete,\nmaterial link to the public accommodation in question. See\nClegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F.3d 752, 756 (9th Cir.\n1994) (twice using the phrase “closely connected”); Welsh\nv. Boy Scouts of America, 993 F.2d 1267, 1272 (7th Cir.\n1993) (deploying the “close[] connect[ion]” test). Only in\nthat circumstance is a plaintiff’s exclusion from such a\nprivilege fairly attributed to the defendant. Otherwise, the\ndefendant may not be subjected to the cost and the\nopprobrium that Title II liability inflicts.\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                          25\n\n    The National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”)\ndoes not have such a connection to any place or activity from\nwhich Hardie was allegedly excluded, nor does it have such\na connection to any act of exclusion itself. Any decision to\nexclude Hardie was made and carried out by entities separate\nfrom the NCAA; the NCAA had no authority or control over\nthose entities. Such places and activities were free to\ncontinue these tournaments, albeit without NCAA approval.\nThe federal courts must be extremely hesitant to second-\nguess the decisions of non-governmental entities charged\nwith the responsibility of developing standards and running\nactivities. Here, the NCAA has that responsibility, and is\nbetter equipped to exercise it than the courts are. Therefore,\nany exclusion of Hardie should not be attributed to the\nNCAA.\n\n    Furthermore, the courts must demand that Title II\ncontain a “clear statement” of congressional intent in order\nto infer that it authorizes disparate-impact liability. I.N.S. v.\nSt. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298—99 (2001). The Supreme Court\nhas instructed that we must employ a “clear statement” rule\nwhen we confront a question of statutory construction that\n“invokes the outer limits of Congress’ power.” Id. at 299.\nThe rule requires “the clearest statement of congressional\nintent,” id. at 312 n.35, so that the courts can be “perfect[ly]\nconfiden[t] that Congress in fact intended” to wade into\nareas of “special constitutional concern[].” Dellmuth v.\nMuth, 491 U.S. 223, 231 (1989). The rule ensures “that the\nlegislature . . . intended to bring into issue . . . the critical\nmatters involved in the judicial decision.” United States v.\nBass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971). Requiring a clear statement\nfrom Congress suggests that “‘Congress does not exercise\nlightly’ the ‘extraordinary power’ to legislate.” Arizona v.\nInter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2256\n\f26                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\n(2013) (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460\n(1991)).\n\n     Disparate-impact liability implicates two constitutional\nconcerns: equal protection and federalism. With respect to\nequal protection, when the courts racially balance the\nparticipants in public accommodations, they impose what is\neffectively a quota—be it fixed or moving. This quota\narrangement confines a participant to the playing room\nallotted to her race; like Linda Brown and her\ncontemporaries more than sixty-three years ago, today’s\nparticipant must learn to tailor her aspirations to the quota\nsystem’s ingenious separate but equal regime. See Brown\nv. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). Shifting quotas\nsuch as those which disparate-impact liability foists on us are\n“[g]overnment action[s]” that “divid[e] us by race.” Parents\nInvolved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No.\n1, 551 U.S. 701, 746 (2007) (plurality opinion). They are\n“inherently suspect because such classifications promote\nnotions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial\nhostility, reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much\nof our history, that individuals should be judged by the color\nof their skin, and endorse race-based reasoning and the\nconception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus\ncontributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.”\nId. (plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). “One of the principal reasons race is treated as a\nforbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and\nworth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his\nor her own merit and essential qualities.” Rice v. Cayetano,\n528 U.S. 495, 517 (2000). Since an impartial sovereign\nordinarily may not make one set of rules for one race and\nanother set of rules for another race, disparate-impact\nliability triggers equal-protection concerns. See Hampton v.\nMow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 100 (1976) (“The federal\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                          27\n\nsovereign, like the States, must govern impartially.”);\nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954)\n(“Classifications based solely upon race must be scrutinized\nwith particular care, since they are contrary to our traditions,\nand hence constitutionally suspect.”).\n\n    As for federalism, federal anti-discrimination statutes\nlike Title II often deter state and local governments from\nimplementing their own affairs, including their traditional\npolice-power prerogatives. See, e.g., Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, 135 S. Ct. 2507 (state agency); Magner v.\nGallagher, 619 F.3d 823 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. dismissed,\n565 U.S. 1187 (2012) (municipal government); In re\nEmployment Discrimination Litigation Against State of Ala.,\n198 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir. 1999) (state agency). After all,\nTitle II imposes the same obligations on state and municipal\nactors as it does on private actors. “The constitutionally\nmandated balance of power between the States and the\nFederal Government” exists “to ensure the protection of our\nfundamental liberties.” Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon,\n473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because disparate-impact liability would\n“radically readjust[] the balance of state and national\nauthority” under Title II’s aegis, its text need clearly say that\nthis is the proper result. BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.,\n511 U.S. 531, 544 (1994) (citations omitted).\n\n    Title II contains no such clear statement. “All persons\nshall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment . . . without\ndiscrimination or segregation,” Title II says. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000a(a).      Since “[t]he statute does not define\n‘discriminat[ion]’” or “segregation,” I consult “the ordinary\nmeaning[s] of the word[s].” CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dept.\nof Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 286 (2011). The ordinary\nmeaning of the word “discrimination” refers to the\n\f28                    HARDIE V.

Additionally, an outcome-\ndeterminative Supreme Court opinion has defined\n“discrimination” as “[p]referring members of any one group\nfor no reason other than race or ethnic origin.” Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307 (1978) (opinion of\nPowell, J.) (emphasis added).\n\n     In this context, making personnel selection or preferring\none person over another on an impermissible basis\npresupposes the defendant’s subjective intent; it involves\ndisparate treatment. No actor can absentmindedly, by\nrelying on subconscious stereotypes, or otherwise without a\ndeliberately discriminatory intent or motive slip into\nintentional behavior such as preferring persons on a racial or\nethnic basis. That would be an oxymoron. When English\nspeakers say that someone has discriminated against a\nperson on a forbidden ground, they are saying that\ncommitting discrimination was the actor’s intent or motive.\nStatistical disparities indicating that certain “practices . . .\nfall more harshly on one group than another,” International\nBroth. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335, n.\n15 (1977), do not establish that the defendant’s disfavor on\nthe basis of “the protected trait . . . actually motivated [her]\ndecision” to prefer some persons over others. Hazen Paper\nCo. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993). By contrast,\ndisparate-impact liability bars practices that generate\ndisproportionately adverse consequences, even when the\norganizer’s motivations appear neutral, so long as there\nexists “an available alternative . . . practice that has less\ndisparate impact and serves the [organization’s] legitimate\nneeds.” Ricci, 557 U.S. at 578. Accordingly, Title II’s\ndecision to maximize the role of the defendant’s subjective\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                          29\n\nintent and to minimize the role of any statistical disparities\nis the opposite of how disparate-impact liability operates.\n\n     Similarly, under Title II, “segregation” is the “[unlawful]\npolicy of separating people on the basis of color, nationality,\nreligion, or the like.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1388 (8th\ned. 2004) (emphasis added).              This definition, too,\npresupposes the actor’s subjective intent; it involves\ndisparate treatment. No actor can absentmindedly, by\nrelying on subconscious stereotypes, or otherwise without a\ndeliberately segregation-effectuating intent or motive slip\ninto intentional behavior such as separating persons on a\nforbidden basis. When English speakers say that someone\nhas segregated members of one group from members of\nanother group on a prohibited basis, they are saying that\ncommitting segregation was the actor’s intent or motive.\nRacially-correlated statistical disparities do not establish that\nthe defendant’s disfavor on the basis of “the protected trait .\n. . actually motivated [her] decision” to segregate persons\nfrom one another. Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 610.\nContrast this with disparate-impact liability, which\neradicates practices that generate disproportionately adverse\neffects, even when the organizer’s motivations appear\nneutral, so long as there exists “an available alternative . . .\npractice that has less disparate impact and serves the\n[organization’s] legitimate needs.” Ricci, 557 U.S. at 578.\nIt follows that Title II’s decision to maximize the role of the\ndefendant’s subjective intent and to minimize the role of any\nstatistical disparities is the opposite of how disparate-impact\nliability works.\n\n   Besides, Title II lacks a catch-all mechanism\nencompassing disparate-impact claims. Unlike the Fair\nHousing Act (“FHA”), which the Inclusive Cmtys. Project\nCourt understood to authorize disparate-impact liability,\n\f30                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nTitle II contains no “results-oriented phrase” such as\n“‘otherwise make unavailable.’” 135 S.Ct. at 2518—19\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)). Consequently, Title II\nauthorizes only disparate-treatment liability.\n\n II. Business-Necessity Defense under Title II Protects the\n                          NCAA.\n\n     Even if Title II had authorized disparate-impact liability,\nthe business-necessity defense would immunize the\nNCAA’s policy. In Inclusive Cmtys. Project, the Supreme\nCourt highlighted the long pedigree of the “‘business[-\n]necessity’ . . . defense to disparate-impact claims.”\n135 S.Ct. at 2517 (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The defense must also apply to Title II, if we\nassume that Title II covers such claims. As long as there is\n“a manifest relationship” between the requirement and the\norganizational necessity, the court will uphold the\nrequirement. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432\n(1971) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But\n“it remains open to the complaining party to show that other\ntests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable\nracial effect, would also serve the [organizer’s] legitimate\ninterest in efficient and trustworthy workmanship.”\nAlbemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Hardie has\ndemonstrated nothing of the sort. Nor could he.\n\n    The NCAA’s or, for that matter, similar organizations’\nlegitimate, bona fide interest in setting up a wholesome\nenvironment with good role models for youth cannot be\noutweighed by some need to give former felons a chance to\nassimilate into society at this level. The NCAA’s interest in\npromoting “efficient and trustworthy [relationships]” among\nthe athletes and their coaches, id., cannot be served without\nhaving coaches who are good role models for youth, which\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                        31\n\nis not a criterion that Title II prohibits. Perhaps in the\nNCAA’s eyes, a felony conviction disqualifies someone\nfrom being a good role model. Moreover, the NCAA might\nnot want to enhance its risk of exposure to liability, if the\nformer felon should commit a crime or a tort while he is a\nparticipant. Thus, the NCAA does not wish to be affiliated\nwith youth athletic tournaments coached by former felons.\nThe NCAA has the right, one with robust constitutional\ndimensions, to decide with whom it will associate, see Boy\nScouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000) (“The\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes\nthe group’s freedom of expressive association [under the\nFirst Amendment] if the presence of that person affects in a\nsignificant way the group’s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.”)—and no one can fault the NCAA.\nThis limited restriction is consistent with Title II. Had the\nNCAA wanted to impose a blanket ban on former felons,\nTitle II would have so permitted.\n\n  III. Resorts to Irrelevant and Extraneous Evidence are\n                        Impermissible.\n\n    The majority’s application of extraneous evidence such\nas human resources experts’, economists’ and\ncriminologists’ reports to this case is, in my view, misplaced.\nFirst, considering such materials for the purposes of\napplying Title II to certain facts does not fall within the\njudicial function’s province. Second, it gives litigants the\nlicense to cherry-pick the convenient evidence they wish to\nsubmit and thus the ability to game the litigation. Third, it\nis not something that federal judges untutored in statistics,\neconomics, sociology, criminology, and other social\nsciences are even competent to ascertain and adjudicate.\nEven if, by dint of luck, the designated federal judge were\ncapable of engaging in competent social-science analysis to\n\f32                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nfigure out if the impact were disparate, her doing so would\nnot elicit the public’s confidence in the legitimate\ndischarging of the judicial role. Never does Article III, when\ninvesting the “judicial [p]ower,” U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1, cl.\n1, in the federal courts, allow our reasoning to be informed\nby “questionable social[-]science research rather than [legal]\nprinciple.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 114 (1995)\n(Thomas, J., concurring). The Framers of our Constitution\nwould have seen the federal courts’ considering such\nevidence as mere “pretext for” the Third Branch to\n“gradual[ly] and unobserved[ly] usurp[]” the policy-making\n“power” that the Constitution commits to our coordinate\nbranches. The Federalist No. 42, p. 265 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961) (J. Madison).\n\n    That a disproportionately high number of felons might\nself-identify as members of any particular race(s) does not\nsomehow convert the NCAA policy into a racially\ndiscriminatory one. Certainly, “[s]ome activities may be\nsuch an irrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted,\nand if they also happen to be engaged in exclusively or\npredominantly by a particular class of people, an intent to\ndisfavor that class can readily be presumed. A tax on\nwearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews,” for instance. Bray v.\nAlexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270\n(1993) (emphasis added). A causal relationship between\nyarmulkes and Jewish people is obvious. But committing\nfelonies is not “predominantly” co-extensive with or an\nessential element of self-identifying with certain races; and\nsaying otherwise is both inaccurate and demeaning to\nindividuals who do self-identify with those races. Id. The\nlatter assertion might be the result of invidious\ndiscrimination, of the soft bigotry of low expectations, or of\nboth. In any event, it “rests on an assumption of [racial]\ninferiority.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 114 (Thomas, J.,\n\f                     HARDIE V. NCAA                        33\n\nconcurring). Moreover, holding a defendant liable on that\nbasis would set a pernicious precedent that the Supreme\nCourt expressly has rejected in materially indistinguishable\ncircumstances. See, e.g., McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279,\n312 (1987) (rejecting “study indicat[ing] a discrepancy that\nappears to correlate with race.”).\n\n    The future need not be grim with limitless disparate-\nimpact claims under Title II. Think of the children and\nyoung adults, some of the most vulnerable members of our\nsociety. What will happen to entertainment platforms for\nyoung people to demonstrate their gifts and diligence? Must\nsuch platforms admit former felons, just because those\nformer felons belong to certain races? Does it depend on\nwhat some criminologist, sociologist, statistician or other\nsocial scientist has to say about the matter today? No and it\nshould not. What about swimming meets where coaches can\nsee the swimmers in compromising attire? Do former felons\nwho happen to self-identify with particular races get a free\npass in hiding behind their races and taking part in those\nmeets? Why would Hardie’s argument not apply to both\ncoaches and judges at athletic and performing-arts\ncompetitions? (If the coaches can be former felons, then so\ntoo can the judges and many other stakeholders be!) Indeed,\nthe more subjective the craft, the worse it will be for the\norganizers because then they have to worry about handling\nboth felonious coaches and felonious judges. Could this not\nlead the organizers to shut down various productive, public-\nservice enterprises altogether, thereby depriving our youth\n(and all of us) of countless opportunities? Will this not\nwreak havoc on our Nation’s “vibrant and dynamic free-\nenterprise system[s],” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at\n2518, committed to altruistic or profit-minded endeavors?\nSince the opportunity costs would be so devastating, the\nprospect is an unwelcome one, which—yet again—is the\n\f34                   HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nreason that Title II does not authorize disparate-impact\nliability.\n\n    The courts undoubtedly have no power to so authorize\non the basis of fickle evidence, namely protean materials like\nthe Nakamura report, with respect to which the Court says\nthat “Hardie has offered no evidence to suggest that this\ndifference in risk, even if small, is immaterial to achieving\nthe NCAA’s interests.” Maj. op. at 18. But what if Hardie\nhad—and the Court had thought it valid? What if tomorrow\nDr. Kiminori Nakamura expands or contracts the study’s\nscope, makes new findings and devises Version 2.0 of the\nsame report? Does Title II’s meaning or application have to\nevolve based on what these non-vetted, democratically non-\nlegitimized academic studies have to say? The federal\ncourts’ privileging certain sympathetic studies without\nadequately investigating their probative value or the\nprejudicial effect they will have is akin to our “look[ing]\nover the heads of the crowd and pick[ing] out [our] friends.”\nANTONIN SCALIA, A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION: FEDERAL\nCOURTS AND THE LAW 36 (1997).\n\n    Likewise, today “[n]either the Rosen report nor the\n[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’)]\nGuidelines” happen to “analyze the racial effect of\nindividualized assessments.” Maj. op. at 21. So the Court\ndeems them insufficiently helpful to Hardie’s claim.\nHowever, if just a few years down the road the Rosen report,\nthe EEOC Guidelines, and other extraneous evidence do end\nup predicting such a “racial effect,” id., will we then allow\nan identical claim to proceed? I hope not, for that would turn\nus into dilettante social scientists and, worse, into\nomnipotent social engineers, a role we have neither the\nexpertise nor the authority to fulfill. Consulting the\ncognoscenti’s social-science research, which frequently is\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                        35\n\nfraught with flawed methodologies and philosophical,\npolitical, and other biases, to decide legal questions is\ntantamount to putting a thumb on the scales to produce a\npalatable result.\n\n    None of this reflects the limitations attending a federal\njudicial commission. Alexander Hamilton believed that the\nfederal courts would be “the best expedient which can be\ndevised in any government” because they help “secure a\nsteady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws”\nthat the whole of the American People, not just the conclave\nof experts, have enacted. The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). Accountable to and\nrepresentative of the American People, the political branches\nare composed of members “sufficiently numerous to feel all\nthe passions which actuate a multitude.” The Federalist No.\n47, p. 332 (C. Van Doren ed. 1945) (J. Madison). Neither of\nthese traits is true of the experts or, for that matter, of the\nfederal courts. Designed to be “the least dangerous” branch,\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 465, one without any “political\nrights,” id., we are empowered to exercise “neither force nor\nwill but merely judgment,” id. (capitalization altered), when\nwe construe our People’s statutory and constitutional\ncommands.\n\n                        *       *        *\n\n     Since Title II lacks “unmistakably clear” language\nauthorizing disparate-impact liability, it does not reach such\nclaims. Atascadero State Hosp., 473 U.S. at 242. Also clear\nis the business-necessity defense, which precludes Hardie’s\nclaim.\n\n   I respectfully concur in part and concur in the judgment.\n\f",

Hardie’s suit rests on a disparate-impact\ntheory of Title II liability. We have never endorsed or\nrejected disparate-impact liability under Title II, and we\nneed not decide this issue today. We hold that even if\ndisparate-impact claims are cognizable under Title II, Hardie\nhas not shown that an equally effective, less discriminatory\nalternative to the NCAA’s felon-exclusion policy exists, as\nhe must do under the three-step analysis for disparate-impact\nclaims set forth in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989). We affirm summary judgment for the\nNCAA.\n\n                              I\n\n    The NCAA is a voluntary, unincorporated association of\nover 1,200 colleges and universities. One of the functions of\nthe NCAA is to develop rules that govern intercollegiate\nathletics, including rules that limit recruitment of student-\n\f6                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nathletes. As part of their recruitment activities, coaches and\nother athletics staff from NCAA member schools attend\nnonscholastic 1 youth athletic tournaments to scout potential\nrecruits. Under NCAA rules, coaches and recruiters from\nDivision I schools may attend nonscholastic tournaments\nonly if the tournaments have obtained certification from the\nNCAA to verify that they are in compliance with NCAA\nguidelines. Without such attendance, the chances that\nplayers might be scouted and later recruited to play for an\nNCAA school are significantly diminished. This in turn\naffects the willingness of teams to play in uncertified\ntournaments and the profitability of private sponsors who\norganize these events.\n\n    The NCAA’s guidelines impose a number of\nrequirements on tournament operators to ensure the safety of\nparticipants and preserve the integrity of college athletics\nrecruiting. The guidelines restrict the number of games\nathletes may play in, for example, and they mandate that\ntournament operators obtain insurance and hire medical\npersonnel. Importantly here, the guidelines require that\ntournament operators abide by the NCAA Participant\nApproval Policy. The Participant Approval Policy provides\nthat anyone seeking to coach at an NCAA-certified\nnonscholastic tournament must submit to a criminal\nbackground check. Under the current version of the policy,\nanyone who has been convicted of a felony is automatically\ndenied approval to coach in an NCAA-certified tournament.\nIf a tournament operator fails to comply with NCAA\nguidelines, including the Participant Approval Policy, the\ntournament will not receive NCAA certification, and NCAA\n\n\n     1\n        Nonscholastic tournaments are tournaments in which the\nparticipating teams are unaffiliated with schools.\n\f                        HARDIE V.

The first\nParticipant Approval Policy governing women’s basketball,\nadopted in 2006, disqualified only prospective coaches who\nhad been convicted of a violent felony, 2 a sex offense, a\ncrime involving children, or a nonviolent felony if the\nnonviolent felony conviction was less than seven years old.\nThe NCAA asserts, however, that the 2006 policy caused\nsafety concerns and administrative difficulties. Certain\ncrimes classified as nonviolent, including financial crimes,\nsports bribery, and possession of controlled substances,\nnonetheless raised significant safety and ethical concerns\nabout    coaches     interacting    with    student-athletes.\nAdditionally, differences between states’ classification of\nthe same crimes led to inconsistent outcomes with respect to\nwho was approved as a tournament coach and who was not.\n\n    In light of these challenges, the NCAA amended the\nParticipant Approval Policy in 2011 to eliminate the violent-\nnonviolent felony distinction. Now, anyone with a felony\nconviction, no matter how old, is denied entry approval to\ncoach. Any prior sex offense conviction, regardless of the\ncharge level, and “active criminal cases” are also\ndisqualifying. Coaches approved under the Participant\nApproval Policy may coach at NCAA-certified tournaments\nfor two years, and then must reapply.\n\n    In conformance with the amended Participant Approval\nPolicy, Dominic Hardie was denied approval to coach at the\n\n    2\n      The NCAA defined “violent felonies” as crimes committed against\na person and punishable by at least one year in prison.\n\f8                       HARDIE V.

In 2001, Hardie had pled guilty and was\nconvicted for possession of a controlled substance (cocaine),\na felony in Texas. Hardie’s felony conviction had not\naffected his ability to coach in NCAA-certified tournaments\nbefore the Participant Approval Policy was amended. Under\nthe pre-2011 version of the policy, Hardie had been able to\ncoach because his only conviction was over seven years old\nand was for a nonviolent felony. But in 2012, when Hardie’s\ncoaching approval expired and he reapplied, he was barred\nfrom coaching under the amended policy banning all felons.\nHardie was allowed to attend the 2013 MidSummer Night’s\nMadness tournament as a spectator, but he could not\nparticipate from the coaches’ bench. Hardie alleges this\nprevented him from having personal contact with the\nstudent-athletes he coaches during the tournament games,\nwhich negatively affected his team members’ performance\nand opportunities to earn college athletics scholarships to\nNCAA schools.\n\n    After exhausting his administrative remedies without\nobtaining approval to coach, Hardie sued the NCAA in\nfederal district court to enjoin enforcement of the Participant\nApproval Policy. 3 Hardie alleges that the Participant\nApproval Policy violates Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a), by denying him the full and\n\n    3\n      Hardie’s First Amended Complaint also named the operator of the\nMidSummer Night’s Madness tournament, the International Girls\nBasketball Organization (IGBO), and the owners of the tournament\nvenues, Alliant International University and Town and Country Hotel,\nLLC, as defendants.

The parties here\nagree that, assuming Title II encompasses disparate-impact\nclaims, the Wards Cove framework would apply to Hardie’s\nclaim.\n\n    Wards Cove burden shifting proceeds in three steps.\nFirst, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case that the\ndefendant’s challenged policy or practice has a\n“significantly disparate impact on nonwhites.” Wards Cove,\n490 U.S. at 658. At the prima facie stage, the plaintiff must\npoint to “the application of a specific or particular . . .\npractice that has created the disparate impact under attack.”\nId. at 657.

In some circumstances, an\nalternative policy may exclude fewer nonwhites but, because\nmany more whites than nonwhites benefit under the\nalternative policy, the alternative actually exacerbates racial\ndisparities. Alternative policies that are less restrictive than\nthe challenged policy but do not result in “less disparate\nimpact” will not withstand scrutiny at step three. 9\n\n    Applying the Wards Cove framework here, Hardie relies\non the Bendick report to establish a prima facie case of\ndisparate impact. The Bendick report reveals that African\nAmericans were significantly overrepresented—by a factor\nof 1.52 to 1.72—among felony-denied applicants compared\nto approved applicants. The NCAA does not contest that\nBendick’s results represent a significant racial disparity, and\nwe agree. Furthermore, because Bendick surveyed only\ncoaches who sought approval after the amended Participant\nApproval Policy took effect, and because he identified\ncoaches who were denied specifically because of a prior\n\n    9\n      Hardie would have us frame the “less disparate impact” question\nsomewhat differently. He contends that, to satisfy this part of the third\nstep of the Wards Cove analysis, he would only need to show that\nprohibiting coaches with nonviolent felonies independently has a\ndisparate impact on African Americans. By Hardie’s logic, if people\nwith nonviolent felonies, a group that is disproportionately African\nAmerican, were allowed to coach, African Americans would\ndisproportionately benefit. We need not evaluate this argument. As\nexplained below, one of Hardie’s proposed alternatives—reverting to the\npre-2011 policy—falters on the “equally effective” prong of the third\nstep of the Wards Cove analysis, not the “less disparate impact” prong.\nAnd Hardie’s logic does not even apply to his other alternative—\nindividual assessments—because not all prospective coaches with\nnonviolent felonies would necessarily be allowed to coach under that\npolicy.\n\f16                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nfelony conviction, the Bendick report also establishes a\n“causal connection” between the Participant Approval\nPolicy’s blanket felon ban and the disproportionate effect on\nAfrican American coaching applicants. See Inclusive\nCmtys., 135 S. Ct. at 2523.\n\n    At Wards Cove step two, the NCAA contends that the\nParticipant Approval Policy serves the NCAA’s interest in\n“protecting the safety of the children who participate in the\ntournaments and the integrity of the NCAA’s recruiting\nprocess and college athletics more generally.” For the most\npart, Hardie accepts that the NCAA’s proffered rationale for\nthe Participant Approval Policy is legitimate. We also agree.\n\n    The parties’ disagreement thus focuses on step three of\nthe Wards Cove analysis. To satisfy his burden at step three,\nHardie proposes two alternatives to the Participant Approval\nPolicy: (1) the NCAA could revert to the pre-2011 version\nof the policy, which disqualified applicants with violent but\nnot nonviolent felony convictions that were at least seven\nyears old; or (2) the NCAA could conduct individualized\nassessments of applicants with felony convictions to\ndetermine if they would pose an unacceptable risk to the\nsafety of tournament participants. We hold that Hardie has\nfailed to show that either of his proposed alternatives would\nbe both equally effective compared to, and less\ndiscriminatory than, the current policy. We address each of\nthese alternatives in turn.\n\n                              1\n\n    Hardie first proposes that the NCAA revert to the version\nof the Participant Approval Policy that was in effect before\n2011. The pre-2011 policy excluded applicants convicted of\na violent felony, a sex offense, or a crime involving children,\n\f                        HARDIE V. NCAA                            17\n\nno matter how old, or a nonviolent felony conviction if the\nconviction was less than seven years old.\n\n    We find Hardie has failed to establish that the pre-2011\npolicy would be equally effective as the current policy in\nserving the NCAA’s legitimate interests. Hardie contends\nthat the pre-2011 policy was proven equally effective\nbecause no documented safety incidents occurred during the\nfew years when that version of the policy was in force. But\nthe NCAA could have reasonably concluded that the level of\nrisk under the pre-2011 policy was unacceptable, even if no\ntournament participants had yet been harmed. Cf. El v. Se.\nPa. Transp. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797056\"><a href=\"/opinion/797056/douglas-el-v-southeastern-pennsylvania-transportation-authority-septa/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (3d Cir. 2007) (“In a\nbroad sense, hiring policies . . . ultimately concern the\nmanagement of risk.”). Indeed, Hardie has not rebutted the\nNCAA’s assertion that under the pre-2011 policy, certain\nnonviolent felonies, such as financial crimes, possession of\ncontrolled substances, and sports bribery, posed\nunreasonable risks for the safety of student-athletes and the\nintegrity of the recruiting process.\n\n    To compare the relative effectiveness of the pre-2011\npolicy and the current policy, Hardie submits a report by Dr.\nKiminori Nakamura, a criminologist and expert on\nrecidivism. The Nakamura report concludes that the\nprobability that someone with a prior conviction will\nrecidivate decreases the longer that person goes without\ncommitting another crime. At some point, known as the\n“redemption time,” the risk that someone with a prior\nconviction will reoffend becomes equal to the risk of arrest\nfor the general population. 10 For people convicted of violent\ncrimes, the redemption time is four to seven years; for drug\n\n    10\n       The Nakamura report measures general population risk including\npeople with and without criminal histories.\n\f18                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nand property crimes, the redemption time is shortened to\nabout four years. Nakamura states that, because Hardie has\nnot committed another criminal offense since 2001, and\nbecause of his age, employment, and educational\nachievements, his risk of future arrest is in fact lower than\nthat of the general population.\n\n    For several reasons, the Nakamura report does not\nestablish that the pre-2011 Participant Approval Policy\noverall screens coaching applicants as effectively as the\ncurrent policy. First, it does not attempt to quantify and\ncompare the risk of future arrest for those permitted to coach\nunder the current Participant Approval Policy with the risk\nof those permitted under the pre-2011 version. Second,\nNakamura acknowledges that, even after many years have\npassed, the risk of future arrest for someone who has a\ncriminal record may remain higher than the risk of future\narrest for someone who has never been arrested. Hardie has\noffered no evidence to suggest that this difference in risk,\neven if small, is immaterial to achieving the NCAA’s\ninterests. Particularly considering that NCAA-approved\ncoaches work with minors, we cannot conclude on the record\nbefore us that this additional risk is insignificant.\n\n    We view this case as similar to El v. Southeastern\nPennsylvania Transportation Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797056\"><a href=\"/opinion/797056/douglas-el-v-southeastern-pennsylvania-transportation-authority-septa/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\nCir. 2007), in which the Third Circuit affirmed summary\njudgment for a local transit authority in a Title VII suit. Id.\nat 235. The transit authority in that case refused to hire\nanyone who had been convicted of a violent crime as a\nparatransit driver for disabled residents. In support of its\npolicy, the transit authority offered unrebutted evidence that,\neven after many years, people convicted of violent crimes\n“are at least somewhat more likely than members of the\ngeneral population to commit a future violent act.” Id. at\n\f                          HARDIE V.

The transit authority’s expert testified that, even if the\nadditional risk that a former violent felon posed “might be\nsmall,” “given the marked sensitivity of the paratransit\nposition at issue, a small but extant difference is sufficient”\nto justify the policy. Id. at 246–47. Analogizing to Hardie’s\nTitle II claim here, Hardie has offered no evidence to suggest\nthat the increased risk posed by coaches with prior felony\nconvictions, even if small, is immaterial to protecting the\nsafety of young athletes.

Beazer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110042\"><a href=\"/opinion/110042/new-york-city-transit-authority-v-beazer/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 n.31 (1979) (holding that transit authority\nwas justified in refusing to hire methadone users for “safety-\nsensitive” positions). Nor does he offer evidence to address\nthe increased risk to preserving the integrity of college\nathletics from nonviolent crimes like sports bribery. 11\n\n    We must also note that reverting to the pre-2011 policy\nwould impose some increased administrative burden on the\nNCAA’s participant approval process.             The NCAA\nsubmitted evidence that the 2011 amendment to the\nParticipant Approval Policy was motivated in part by\nadministrative difficulties in distinguishing between violent\nand nonviolent crimes given states’ differing definitions of\nthe same offenses. While costs and other administrative\nburdens are only a “factor” in the equal effectiveness\nanalysis, see Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 661, and perhaps only\na small one in this case, the increased administrative burden\n\n\n    11\n       We do not mean to suggest that the small risk posed by individuals\nwith nonviolent felony convictions will always be material. In some\ncases, the risk presented by a felony conviction will be a generalized one,\nattenuated from the work of the organization in question. We are not\npresented with that situation here, though. In this context, where coaches\noften travel with, are responsible for, and have a great deal of influence\nover minors, and where certain crimes are particularly relevant to the\nintegrity of college athletics recruiting, the risk is material.\n\f20                   HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nhere is an additional factor that weighs slightly in the\nNCAA’s favor.\n\n    In sum, Hardie has not carried his burden at step three of\nthe Wards Cove framework with respect to this proposed\nalternative. He has not adduced sufficient evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that excluding\nviolent felons, but not nonviolent felons, from coaching\nwould be equally effective at achieving the NCAA’s goals\nas the current policy. While we recognize that the plaintiff’s\nburden at the alternatives stage is a demanding one, courts\nmust take caution before displacing reasonable business\njudgments. Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 661 (“Courts are\ngenerally less competent than employers to restructure\nbusiness practices.” (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v.\nWaters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109934\"><a href=\"/opinion/109934/furnco-constr-corp-v-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (1978))). Because we hold that\nHardie has failed to prove that the pre-2011 Participant\nApproval Policy would serve the NCAA’s legitimate\ninterests as effectively as the current policy, we need not\ndecide whether reverting to the pre-2011 policy would result\nin a lesser adverse racial effect.\n\n                              2\n\n    As a second alternative, Hardie proposes that the NCAA\nconduct individualized assessments of applicants with a\nfelony conviction to calculate the actual risks posed by an\napplicant. Hardie’s expert on human resources practices,\nLester S. Rosen, states that individualized assessments may\ntake into account factors such as “any mitigating\ncircumstance about the offense, the age of the offense, . . .\npast employment, educational achievements since the\noffense, and other signs of rehabilitation.”\n\n    Hardie’s individualized assessments alternative fails at\nstep three of the Wards Cove analysis, because he has put\n\f                     HARDIE V. NCAA                        21\n\nforward no evidence from which a reasonable jury could\nconclude that individualized assessments would have less\ndisparate impact than the current Participant Approval\nPolicy. None of Hardie’s experts analyze the expected racial\nimpact of individualized assessments using the criteria\nHardie proposes. The Rosen report only remarks generally\nthat “[t]here is widespread recognition that a policy of\nautomatically rejecting an applicant on the basis of a felony\nconviction, without any consideration of the offense, the\nposition in question, the age of the offense, and evidence of\nrehabilitation, is both unfair and potentially violates Civil\nRights laws.” Hardie also points to EEOC Guidelines that\nrecommend employers adopt individualized assessments as\na tool to avoid Title VII liability in the employment context.\nU.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, No. 915.002, EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance: Consideration of Arrest and\nConviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 18 (2012). Neither the\nRosen report nor the EEOC Guidelines analyze the racial\neffect of individualized assessments. Without more, we\ncannot say that Hardie has met his burden to show that\nindividualized assessments would be a less discriminatory\nalternative to the current Participant Approval Policy.\n\n    Because neither of Hardie’s proposed alternatives to the\nParticipant Approval Policy pass muster at the final stage of\nWards Cove burden shifting, the NCAA is entitled to\nsummary judgment.\n\n                              C\n\n    Alternatively, the NCAA urges us to affirm summary\njudgment on the ground that it has not actually denied Hardie\na “privilege[] . . . of [a] place of public accommodation,”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a), because tournament operators, rather\nthan the NCAA, actually enforce the Participant Approval\n\f22                       HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nPolicy. Because we find that Hardie failed to produce\nsufficient proof at step three of the Wards Cove analysis, we\nneed not reach this alternative basis for upholding summary\njudgment.\n\n                                   IV\n\n    We do not decide today whether Title II of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 encompasses disparate-impact claims.\nEven assuming arguendo that disparate-impact claims are\ncognizable under Title II, Hardie has not created a genuine\nissue of material fact that one of his proposed alternatives to\nthe NCAA’s Participant Approval Policy would be both\nequally effective and less discriminatory. The NCAA is\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFABER, District Judge, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment:\n\n    I agree with the Court that under Title II, Appellant\nDominic Hardie has not stated a cognizable claim. Yet the\nCourt skirts a key issue that this case squarely presents:\nWhether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under Title\nII.\n\n   In my view, Title II’s text does not recognize disparate-\nimpact liability, and we should clearly say so. 1 Title II\n     1\n        The Court’s statement that “the [National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation (‘NCAA’)] does not challenge Hardie’s argument that Title\nII encompasses disparate-impact claims,” Maj. op. at 11, tells only part\nof the story.

Title II’s Text Precludes Disparate-Impact Liability.\n\n    The text of Title II does not authorize disparate-impact\nliability, which typically flows from “practices that have a\n‘disproportionately adverse effect on minorities’ and are\notherwise unjustified by a legitimate rationale.” Inclusive\nCmtys.

Under disparate-impact liability, “a\nfacially neutral . . . practice may be deemed [unlawfully\ndiscriminatory] without evidence of the [defendant’s]\nsubjective intent to discriminate that is required in a\n‘disparate-treatment’ case.” Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\n\n\nthis Court on that issue.

In fact, the NCAA stated: “In light of the\nNCAA’s decision not to defend the district court’s reasoning, the Court\nmay deem it appropriate to appoint an amicus curiae to do so.” In other\nwords, the NCAA strategically chose to focus on the narrower reasons\nin its brief. However, amici Pacific Legal Foundation (“PLF”), the\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute (“CEI”), and the Center for Equal\nOpportunity (“CEO”) have argued most ably that Title II does not\nauthorize disparate-impact liability.\n\f24                    HARDIE V.

NCAA                          29\n\nintent and to minimize the role of any statistical disparities\nis the opposite of how disparate-impact liability operates.\n\n     Similarly, under Title II, “segregation” is the “[unlawful]\npolicy of separating people on the basis of color, nationality,\nreligion, or the like.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1388 (8th\ned. 2004) (emphasis added).              This definition, too,\npresupposes the actor’s subjective intent; it involves\ndisparate treatment. No actor can absentmindedly, by\nrelying on subconscious stereotypes, or otherwise without a\ndeliberately segregation-effectuating intent or motive slip\ninto intentional behavior such as separating persons on a\nforbidden basis. When English speakers say that someone\nhas segregated members of one group from members of\nanother group on a prohibited basis, they are saying that\ncommitting segregation was the actor’s intent or motive.\nRacially-correlated statistical disparities do not establish that\nthe defendant’s disfavor on the basis of “the protected trait .\n. . actually motivated [her] decision” to segregate persons\nfrom one another. Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 610.\nContrast this with disparate-impact liability, which\neradicates practices that generate disproportionately adverse\neffects, even when the organizer’s motivations appear\nneutral, so long as there exists “an available alternative . . .\npractice that has less disparate impact and serves the\n[organization’s] legitimate needs.” Ricci, 557 U.S. at 578.\nIt follows that Title II’s decision to maximize the role of the\ndefendant’s subjective intent and to minimize the role of any\nstatistical disparities is the opposite of how disparate-impact\nliability works.\n\n   Besides, Title II lacks a catch-all mechanism\nencompassing disparate-impact claims. Unlike the Fair\nHousing Act (“FHA”), which the Inclusive Cmtys. Project\nCourt understood to authorize disparate-impact liability,\n\f30                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nTitle II contains no “results-oriented phrase” such as\n“‘otherwise make unavailable.’” 135 S.Ct. at 2518—19\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)). Consequently, Title II\nauthorizes only disparate-treatment liability.\n\n II. Business-Necessity Defense under Title II Protects the\n                          NCAA.\n\n     Even if Title II had authorized disparate-impact liability,\nthe business-necessity defense would immunize the\nNCAA’s policy. In Inclusive Cmtys. Project, the Supreme\nCourt highlighted the long pedigree of the “‘business[-\n]necessity’ . . . defense to disparate-impact claims.”\n135 S.Ct. at 2517 (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The defense must also apply to Title II, if we\nassume that Title II covers such claims. As long as there is\n“a manifest relationship” between the requirement and the\norganizational necessity, the court will uphold the\nrequirement. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432\n(1971) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But\n“it remains open to the complaining party to show that other\ntests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable\nracial effect, would also serve the [organizer’s] legitimate\ninterest in efficient and trustworthy workmanship.”\nAlbemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (1975)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Hardie has\ndemonstrated nothing of the sort. Nor could he.\n\n    The NCAA’s or, for that matter, similar organizations’\nlegitimate, bona fide interest in setting up a wholesome\nenvironment with good role models for youth cannot be\noutweighed by some need to give former felons a chance to\nassimilate into society at this level. The NCAA’s interest in\npromoting “efficient and trustworthy [relationships]” among\nthe athletes and their coaches, id., cannot be served without\nhaving coaches who are good role models for youth, which\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                        31\n\nis not a criterion that Title II prohibits. Perhaps in the\nNCAA’s eyes, a felony conviction disqualifies someone\nfrom being a good role model. Moreover, the NCAA might\nnot want to enhance its risk of exposure to liability, if the\nformer felon should commit a crime or a tort while he is a\nparticipant. Thus, the NCAA does not wish to be affiliated\nwith youth athletic tournaments coached by former felons.\nThe NCAA has the right, one with robust constitutional\ndimensions, to decide with whom it will associate, see Boy\nScouts of America v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648 (2000) (“The\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes\nthe group’s freedom of expressive association [under the\nFirst Amendment] if the presence of that person affects in a\nsignificant way the group’s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.”)—and no one can fault the NCAA.\nThis limited restriction is consistent with Title II. Had the\nNCAA wanted to impose a blanket ban on former felons,\nTitle II would have so permitted.\n\n  III. Resorts to Irrelevant and Extraneous Evidence are\n                        Impermissible.\n\n    The majority’s application of extraneous evidence such\nas human resources experts’, economists’ and\ncriminologists’ reports to this case is, in my view, misplaced.\nFirst, considering such materials for the purposes of\napplying Title II to certain facts does not fall within the\njudicial function’s province. Second, it gives litigants the\nlicense to cherry-pick the convenient evidence they wish to\nsubmit and thus the ability to game the litigation. Third, it\nis not something that federal judges untutored in statistics,\neconomics, sociology, criminology, and other social\nsciences are even competent to ascertain and adjudicate.\nEven if, by dint of luck, the designated federal judge were\ncapable of engaging in competent social-science analysis to\n\f32                    HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nfigure out if the impact were disparate, her doing so would\nnot elicit the public’s confidence in the legitimate\ndischarging of the judicial role. Never does Article III, when\ninvesting the “judicial [p]ower,” U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1, cl.\n1, in the federal courts, allow our reasoning to be informed\nby “questionable social[-]science research rather than [legal]\nprinciple.” Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114 (1995)\n(Thomas, J., concurring). The Framers of our Constitution\nwould have seen the federal courts’ considering such\nevidence as mere “pretext for” the Third Branch to\n“gradual[ly] and unobserved[ly] usurp[]” the policy-making\n“power” that the Constitution commits to our coordinate\nbranches. The Federalist No. 42, p. 265 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961) (J. Madison).\n\n    That a disproportionately high number of felons might\nself-identify as members of any particular race(s) does not\nsomehow convert the NCAA policy into a racially\ndiscriminatory one. Certainly, “[s]ome activities may be\nsuch an irrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted,\nand if they also happen to be engaged in exclusively or\npredominantly by a particular class of people, an intent to\ndisfavor that class can readily be presumed. A tax on\nwearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews,” for instance. Bray v.\nAlexandria Women’s Health Clinic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270\n(1993) (emphasis added). A causal relationship between\nyarmulkes and Jewish people is obvious. But committing\nfelonies is not “predominantly” co-extensive with or an\nessential element of self-identifying with certain races; and\nsaying otherwise is both inaccurate and demeaning to\nindividuals who do self-identify with those races. Id. The\nlatter assertion might be the result of invidious\ndiscrimination, of the soft bigotry of low expectations, or of\nboth. In any event, it “rests on an assumption of [racial]\ninferiority.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 114 (Thomas, J.,\n\f                     HARDIE V. NCAA                        33\n\nconcurring). Moreover, holding a defendant liable on that\nbasis would set a pernicious precedent that the Supreme\nCourt expressly has rejected in materially indistinguishable\ncircumstances. See, e.g., McCleskey v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n312 (1987) (rejecting “study indicat[ing] a discrepancy that\nappears to correlate with race.”).\n\n    The future need not be grim with limitless disparate-\nimpact claims under Title II. Think of the children and\nyoung adults, some of the most vulnerable members of our\nsociety. What will happen to entertainment platforms for\nyoung people to demonstrate their gifts and diligence? Must\nsuch platforms admit former felons, just because those\nformer felons belong to certain races? Does it depend on\nwhat some criminologist, sociologist, statistician or other\nsocial scientist has to say about the matter today? No and it\nshould not. What about swimming meets where coaches can\nsee the swimmers in compromising attire? Do former felons\nwho happen to self-identify with particular races get a free\npass in hiding behind their races and taking part in those\nmeets? Why would Hardie’s argument not apply to both\ncoaches and judges at athletic and performing-arts\ncompetitions? (If the coaches can be former felons, then so\ntoo can the judges and many other stakeholders be!) Indeed,\nthe more subjective the craft, the worse it will be for the\norganizers because then they have to worry about handling\nboth felonious coaches and felonious judges. Could this not\nlead the organizers to shut down various productive, public-\nservice enterprises altogether, thereby depriving our youth\n(and all of us) of countless opportunities? Will this not\nwreak havoc on our Nation’s “vibrant and dynamic free-\nenterprise system[s],” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at\n2518, committed to altruistic or profit-minded endeavors?\nSince the opportunity costs would be so devastating, the\nprospect is an unwelcome one, which—yet again—is the\n\f34                   HARDIE V. NCAA\n\nreason that Title II does not authorize disparate-impact\nliability.\n\n    The courts undoubtedly have no power to so authorize\non the basis of fickle evidence, namely protean materials like\nthe Nakamura report, with respect to which the Court says\nthat “Hardie has offered no evidence to suggest that this\ndifference in risk, even if small, is immaterial to achieving\nthe NCAA’s interests.” Maj. op. at 18. But what if Hardie\nhad—and the Court had thought it valid? What if tomorrow\nDr. Kiminori Nakamura expands or contracts the study’s\nscope, makes new findings and devises Version 2.0 of the\nsame report? Does Title II’s meaning or application have to\nevolve based on what these non-vetted, democratically non-\nlegitimized academic studies have to say? The federal\ncourts’ privileging certain sympathetic studies without\nadequately investigating their probative value or the\nprejudicial effect they will have is akin to our “look[ing]\nover the heads of the crowd and pick[ing] out [our] friends.”\nANTONIN SCALIA, A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION: FEDERAL\nCOURTS AND THE LAW 36 (1997).\n\n    Likewise, today “[n]either the Rosen report nor the\n[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’)]\nGuidelines” happen to “analyze the racial effect of\nindividualized assessments.” Maj. op. at 21. So the Court\ndeems them insufficiently helpful to Hardie’s claim.\nHowever, if just a few years down the road the Rosen report,\nthe EEOC Guidelines, and other extraneous evidence do end\nup predicting such a “racial effect,” id., will we then allow\nan identical claim to proceed? I hope not, for that would turn\nus into dilettante social scientists and, worse, into\nomnipotent social engineers, a role we have neither the\nexpertise nor the authority to fulfill. Consulting the\ncognoscenti’s social-science research, which frequently is\n\f                      HARDIE V. NCAA                        35\n\nfraught with flawed methodologies and philosophical,\npolitical, and other biases, to decide legal questions is\ntantamount to putting a thumb on the scales to produce a\npalatable result.\n\n    None of this reflects the limitations attending a federal\njudicial commission. Alexander Hamilton believed that the\nfederal courts would be “the best expedient which can be\ndevised in any government” because they help “secure a\nsteady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws”\nthat the whole of the American People, not just the conclave\nof experts, have enacted. The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). Accountable to and\nrepresentative of the American People, the political branches\nare composed of members “sufficiently numerous to feel all\nthe passions which actuate a multitude.” The Federalist No.\n47, p. 332 (C. Van Doren ed. 1945) (J. Madison). Neither of\nthese traits is true of the experts or, for that matter, of the\nfederal courts. Designed to be “the least dangerous” branch,\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 465, one without any “political\nrights,” id., we are empowered to exercise “neither force nor\nwill but merely judgment,” id. (capitalization altered), when\nwe construe our People’s statutory and constitutional\ncommands.\n\n                        *       *        *\n\n     Since Title II lacks “unmistakably clear” language\nauthorizing disparate-impact liability, it does not reach such\nclaims. Atascadero State Hosp., 473 U.S. at 242. Also clear\nis the business-necessity defense, which precludes Hardie’s\nclaim.\n\n   I respectfully concur in part and concur in the judgment.\n\f</pre>",
