The\n\nCity was ordered to pay over $440,000 in damages and $150,000 in attorney’s fees,\n\fand it was ordered to specifically perform its duties under the contract at issue. On\n\nappeal, the City contends by twelve issues that the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment on the jury’s verdict. We will affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Casso was appointed by the City in 1990 to be the presiding judge of its\n\nmunicipal court.     In 1991, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n(“Lupus”), an autoimmune disorder with no known cure. Casso was reappointed as\n\nmunicipal judge several times, but decided to resign in 1999. At that time, she informed\n\nthe City that she believed her health condition had been aggravated by unsanitary\n\nconditions at the building in which she worked. She indicated to City officials that she\n\nwould be amenable to releasing whatever claims she had against the City in exchange\n\nfor, among other things, continued health insurance coverage.           Accordingly, Casso\n\nnegotiated an agreement with the City in which she promised to release the City “from\n\nany type of claim, demand, and cause of action whatsoever arising out of her\n\nemployment or that could have been brought by her, relating to her employment or her\n\nseparation . . . .” The agreement further stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n       1. CONSIDERATION\n\n       In consideration for the promise made by Casso in this Agreement, the\n       City agrees to the following payments and/or benefits referred herein as\n       “Consideration”: a lump sum payment equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars\n       ($50,000.00) plus an amount equal to the City’s total contributions to\n       Casso’s [Texas Municipal Retirement System] account as of the date of\n       the execution of this Agreement. In addition, the City will continue to pay\n       Casso’s health insurance premiums for Health Insurance coverage with\n       The City of McAllen throughout the period of time from the date of the\n       execution of this Agreement through June 2002.\n\n              ....\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       5. NATURE OF CONSIDERATION\n\n       Casso understands and acknowledges that the settlement payments\n       hereunder are for the alleged mental anguish and physical sickness she\n       has claimed, associated with the aggravation of her physical disability,\n       Lupus. Casso understands that the City denies the claims she has\n       asserted.\n\n               ....\n\n       16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\n       This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, covenant, and\n       consideration between the parties. There was no reliance upon any other\n       representation, statement, consideration, covenant, promise, or\n       agreement not contained in the Agreement for the covenant made in these\n       documents.\n\n       17. REPRESENTATIONS BY CASSO\n\n       In return for the Consideration, Casso represents the following to the City:\n       (1) I am legally competent to execute this Agreement; (2) in making this\n       settlement and with respect to the Agreement, I have had the benefit of\n       advise [sic] of counsel chosen by me; (3) no promise or representation of\n       any kind has been made to me by the City, or by anyone acting for the\n       City, except as is expressly stated in the Agreement; . . . (7) I understand\n       that the Agreement represents and contains the entire agreement\n       between the parties hereto . . . .\n\nCasso, acting on her own behalf and without independent legal counsel, executed the\n\nrelease agreement along with the City’s attorney on April 12, 1999.\n\n       In accordance with the agreement, the City paid Casso $128,000,1 and it paid\n\nher health insurance premiums until June 1, 2002. At that time, Casso began making\n\nthe monthly premium payments. The City believed, however, that it was not obligated\n\nunder the agreement to keep Casso enrolled indefinitely on its insurance plan, even if\n\nCasso continued to make the premium payments. Instead, the City believed that Casso\n\n\n       1\n         This sum included the $50,000 lump sum and $78,000 representing the City’s contributions to\nCasso’s retirement account.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fwould be eligible for 18 months of post-employment health insurance coverage through\n\nCOBRA, beginning in June 2002.2              In 2001, the City sent Casso a form entitled\n\n“Enrollment/Change/Cancellation Form” and it asked that Casso sign it. Casso testified:\n\n       I was asked to come by the insurance department and talk to Becky and\n       another young lady that were there. I was told that I needed to sign that\n       form. And I was—I said, why. And I joked with them about never signing\n       a form that was blank. But I was told that was so that they could enroll me\n       on the new—I think they went from TML [Texas Municipal League] to\n       TASB [Texas Association of School Boards] or—there had been a change\n       in their third party—in their carrier or whatever they were called.[3] And it\n       seemed innocent enough to me. And then I did read the portion where I\n       signed and even that was an innocent—I joked with them. I said you want\n       me to sign so they can take money from my payroll—from my paycheck\n       but I wasn’t getting a paycheck from the City. So it really—you know, if I\n       was going to continue my insurance it didn’t make a difference to me\n       whether I signed that or not. It had—in my opinion it had no value. They\n       were asking me to sign something just so they could continue to process\n       my insurance and keep me current. And they had me sign something that\n       says I authorize the City of McAllen to take money from my paycheck or to\n       make a payroll deduction.\n\nCasso signed the blank form on a signature line underneath the following statement: “I\n\nauthorize my employer to make the appropriate payroll deductions as a result of this\n\nenrollment and/or change.” The City then forwarded the form to TASB, its third-party\n\nclaims administrator, along with a letter from Rebecca Ramirez, the City’s benefits\n\ncoordinator, explaining that Casso was enrolling in COBRA health insurance coverage.\n\nThe letter, which was admitted into evidence at trial, claimed that Casso is “eligible for\n\nC[OBRA] benefits effective July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003.” The form, as\n\n\n       2\n           “COBRA” refers to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. See 42\nU.S.C. §§ 300bb-1–300bb-8. Section 300bb-1(a) of COBRA applies to health insurance plans\nmaintained by state and local governmental units. Id. § 300bb-1(a). It requires that such plans permit\nemployees who lose coverage as a result of a “qualifying event,” such as termination of employment, to\nelect to continue coverage for up to 18 months following the “qualifying event.” Id.\n       3\n         The evidence showed that the health insurance plan at issue was maintained by the City itself\nand that there was no separate insurance “carrier.”       The City did, however, use third-party\nadministrators—including, at various times, TML and TASB—to process claims under the plan.\n\n                                                  4\n\fsent to TASB, had the words “Cobra Coverage” handwritten on a line next to the words\n\n“Qualifying Event.” Casso stated that she did not intend for the form to be used to enroll\n\nher in COBRA, because she believed she was still entitled, under the agreement, to be\n\ncovered by the City’s insurance plan as long as she paid the premiums.4\n\n        Despite the fact that Casso continued to make the premium payments, the City\n\nterminated her health insurance coverage at the end of December 2003. Casso later\n\nsued the City, claiming that the City was obligated under the release agreement to keep\n\nher on its health insurance plan until she turned 65, at which point she would be eligible\n\nfor Medicare. The trial court initially granted a plea to the jurisdiction in favor of the City,\n\nbut we reversed.        Casso v. City of McAllen, No. 13-08-00618-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 2049, at *22–23 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\n\n(holding that “the City was performing a proprietary function in providing Casso with\n\nhealth insurance coverage; therefore, the City is not entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity”).\n\n        At trial, Casso testified that, after the City terminated her coverage, she applied\n\nfor health insurance through the State Bar of Texas but was denied. She also made\n\nseveral other unsuccessful attempts to obtain health insurance coverage. Casso stated\n\n\n        4\n            Eventually, Casso learned that she was ineligible for COBRA coverage as of June 1, 2002,\nbecause more than 18 months had passed since the applicable “qualifying event”—i.e., the termination of\nher employment. See id. § 300bb-2(2)(A)(i) (stating that, where the “qualifying event” is termination of\nemployment or reduced hours, the “maximum required period” of continued coverage is “the date which is\n18 months after the date of the qualifying event”); § 300bb-3 (stating that a “qualifying event” means “any\nof the following events which, but for the continuation coverage required under this subchapter, would\nresult in the loss of coverage of a qualified beneficiary: (1) The death of the covered employee[;] (2) The\ntermination (other than by reason of such employee’s gross misconduct), or reduction of hours, of the\ncovered employee’s employment[;] (3) The divorce or legal separation of the covered employee from the\nemployee’s spouse[;] (4) The covered employee becoming entitled to benefits under title XVIII of the\nSocial Security Act[;] (5) A dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child under the generally\napplicable requirements of the plan.”). The City’s staff was mistaken in its belief that, under COBRA, the\n“qualifying event” was the termination of Casso’s fully-paid health insurance coverage on June 1, 2002.\nSee id. § 300bb-3.\n\n                                                    5\n\fthat she has gone without health insurance coverage since December 2003.                She\n\nidentified evidence of several large medical bills she paid out-of-pocket since then.\n\n       Casso conceded on cross-examination that, if a City employee resigns, he or she\n\nwould not ordinarily be entitled to continued health insurance coverage beyond access\n\nto COBRA.     She also stated that she specifically negotiated certain terms of the\n\nsettlement agreement. In particular, Casso demanded that the agreement state that\n\nshe resigned her position and was not terminated; she demanded that the agreement\n\nstate that the compensation was for “aggravation” of her Lupus condition; and she\n\ndemanded that the agreement make no reference to her potential COBRA eligibility.\n\n       Casso agreed with the City’s counsel that the City had complied with the release\n\nagreement’s express requirements that it (1) pay her $50,000, (2) pay her an amount\n\nequal to the contributions made by the City to her retirement account, and (3) pay her\n\nhealth insurance premiums up until June 2002.         Casso argued, however, that the\n\nagreement contained an additional implied term—namely, that the City was required to\n\nmaintain her eligibility to buy into the health insurance plan until such time as she\n\nbecame eligible for Medicare—which the City violated by unilaterally terminating her\n\ncoverage at the end of December 2003.\n\n       Casso’s theory was that the agreement was ambiguous because, while it\n\nspecified the date upon which the City would stop paying her insurance premiums, it did\n\nnot specify the date upon which her ability to buy into the plan—that is, her ability to\n\nmaintain enrollment in the plan while paying her own premiums—would be terminated.\n\nCasso urged that the ambiguity could be resolved by considering the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the formation of the agreement; in particular, she noted that, at the time of\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe agreement, the City was fully aware of her medical condition and her need for\n\ncontinuous health insurance coverage.\n\n        Casso also argued that the ambiguity could be resolved by referring to the City’s\n\n2003 “Employee Benefit Plan” (the “Plan”). The Plan, which was entered into evidence,\n\ndefines four different categories of “participant”: (1) a regular full-time employee; (2) a\n\nspouse or child of a participant; (3) a retired employee “who meets the requirements set\n\nforth in this Plan”5; or (4) a COBRA participant. Casso reasoned that, because she was\n\nno longer a full-time employee and because COBRA is legally available for only 18\n\nmonths post-employment, she must have been covered as a “retiree” participant from\n\n1999 until December 2003. She further claimed that, under the terms of the plan, a\n\n“retiree” is entitled to buy in to coverage until the time he or she turns 65 years old and\n\nbecomes eligible for Medicare. She argued that the City breached the agreement by\n\nterminating her access to coverage prior to age 65.\n\n        The City contended that the agreement was unambiguous and it filed a motion in\n\nlimine seeking to exclude, among other things, extraneous evidence regarding the\n\nterms of the agreement. The City also filed a motion to exclude any evidence of an oral\n\nagreement on parol evidence grounds. The trial court denied the motions, thereby\n\nimplicitly concluding as a matter of law that the agreement was ambiguous. See Anglo-\n\nDutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d 445, 451 (Tex. 2011)\n\n        5\n         The Plan defines a retiree “participant” as “[a] person who is an Eligible SB 404 Retiree of the\nCity who has: 1) 28 years of service, or 2) 25 years of service and age 50, or 3) 10 years of service and\nage 60.” “Eligible SB 404 Retiree” apparently refers to Texas Local Government Code chapter 175,\nwhich was originally enacted as Senate Bill 404. See Act of June 15, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 663, § 1,\n1993 TEX. SESS. LAW . SERV. 2462, 2463–64 (amended 1995, 2009) (current version at TEX. LOC. GOV’T\nCODE ANN. §§ 175.001–.007 (West Supp. 2011)). That chapter provides, among other things, that a\nperson who retires from a municipality with a population of 25,000 or more and is “entitled to receive\nretirement benefits from a . . . municipal retirement plan” is entitled to purchase continued health\ninsurance coverage from the municipality. See TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 175.001–.002.\n\n\n                                                   7\n\f(“Only where a contract is ambiguous may a court consider the parties’ interpretation\n\nand ‘admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.’”)\n\n(quoting David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450–51 (Tex. 2008) (per\n\ncuriam)).\n\n        After trial, the jury found that the City agreed to treat Casso as a “retiree” under\n\nthe City’s health plan and that the City failed to comply with that agreement. The jury\n\nawarded damages as follows: $38,523.43 for medical costs incurred by Casso between\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the time of trial; $150,000 for medical costs incurred on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 which the City’s insurance plan would have paid; $126,000 in past net\n\nprofits; and $126,000 in future net profits. The jury further found that the City committed\n\nfraud against Casso and awarded an additional $126,000 in damages representing\n\nfuture net profits.6 Casso filed a “Motion to Sign Judgment” in accordance with the\n\nverdict. The trial court granted the motion and rendered final judgment awarding Casso\n\n$440,523.43 in actual damages, $8,705.20 in court costs, $150,000 in attorney’s fees,\n\nand pre- and post-judgment interest.7 The final judgment further stated:\n\n        [T]his Court also enters judgment on the equitable remedy of specific\n        performance and [the City] is hereby ordered to enroll [Casso] on its\n        current health insurance plan as a “Retiree Participant” within three (3)\n\n        6\n         A majority of the jury also found fraud by clear and convincing evidence and awarded Casso\n$300,000 in exemplary damages. However, that finding was not unanimous and so judgment was not\nrendered thereon. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 41.003(e) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n         Moreover, the $126,000 in future net profits awarded as fraud damages was not included in the\nfinal judgment, presumably because $126,000 in future net profits damages had already been awarded\npursuant to the breach of contract finding. This is despite the fact that the jury was instructed in the\ndamages questions as follows: “You shall not award any sum of money on any element if you have\notherwise, under some other element, awarded a sum of money for the same loss. That is, do not\ncompensate twice for the same loss, if any.”\n        7\n          Pre-judgment interest was awarded only on “$314,523.43 in past damages.” This amount\nincludes all of the damages awarded except those attributable to future net profits. Post-judgment\ninterest was awarded on the entire amount of damages, plus all fees, costs, and pre-judgment interest\nawarded in the judgment, amounting to $659,460.38.\n\n                                                   8\n\f       days of the date of this Judgment and [Casso] is ordered to pay monthly\n       premiums of $245 beginning the first day of the month following the date\n       of this Judgment. [Casso] shall remain on [the City]’s health insurance\n       Plan as a “Retiree Participant” until the earlier of the following dates: (a)\n       the date of [Casso]’s death; (b) the last day of the month in which [Casso]\n       turns 65; or (c) the last day of the month in which [Casso] fails to pay the\n       $245 monthly premium.\n\n       The City filed a motion for new trial as well as a motion to modify, correct, or\n\nreform the judgment, both of which were overruled by operation of law. See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 329b(c). This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Breach of Contract Claim\n\n       By its first issue, the City contends that there was legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that it agreed to treat Casso as a “retiree” for\n\npurposes of her post-employment health insurance coverage. By its second issue, the\n\nCity urges that there was legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the finding\n\nthat the City breached its obligations under any such agreement.\n\n       1. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       In evaluating the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting a verdict, we\n\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every\n\nreasonable inference that would support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,\n\n822 (Tex. 2005). We will sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only if: (1) there is a\n\ncomplete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of\n\nevidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the\n\nevidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the\n\nevidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact. Id. at 810. In reviewing\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ffactual sufficiency, we consider all the evidence in a neutral light and will set aside the\n\njudgment only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be\n\nclearly wrong and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).\n\n       Our primary concern when construing a written contract is to ascertain the true\n\nintentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d\n\n391, 393 (Tex. 1983); Heil Co. v. Polar Corp., 191 S.W.3d 805, 810 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2006, pet. denied). If the language of a contract can be given a certain and\n\ndefinite meaning, it is not ambiguous and the contract’s construction is a matter for the\n\ncourt. Milner v. Milner, 361 S.W.3d 615, 619 (Tex. 2012) (citing Chrysler Ins. Co. v.\n\nGreenspoint Dodge of Houston, Inc., 297 S.W.3d 248, 252 (Tex. 2009) (per curiam)).\n\nOn the other hand, if the agreement is susceptible to more than one reasonable\n\ninterpretation, the agreement is ambiguous, creating a fact issue on the parties’ intent.\n\nId. (citing J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003)).           An\n\nunambiguous contract will be enforced as written, and parol evidence cannot be\n\nreceived for the purpose of creating an ambiguity or to give the contract a meaning\n\ndifferent from that which its language imports. Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d\n\nat 451.   “Only where a contract is ambiguous may a court consider the parties’\n\ninterpretation and ‘admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the\n\ninstrument.’” Id. (quoting Haden, 266 S.W.3d at 450–51).\n\n       A trial court’s determination of whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of\n\nlaw that we review de novo. Bowden v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 247 S.W.3d 690, 705\n\n(Tex. 2008).\n\n       2. Analysis\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f        The City argues that the agreement was unambiguous as a matter of law and\n\nthat parol evidence was, therefore, inadmissible to establish its terms. It contends that,\n\nwithout such parol evidence, there was legally and factually insufficient evidentiary\n\nsupport for the jury’s finding that the City breached its contract with Casso.\n\n        At trial, Casso advanced several arguments as to why the agreement was\n\nambiguous. First, she contended that because the City agreed to pay her the entire\n\namount it contributed to her retirement account, the City must therefore have intended\n\nto treat her as a “retiree.”8 She notes that a City employee ordinarily must accrue at\n\nleast ten years of service before he or she is “vested” and eligible to receive the\n\nretirement contributions previously made by the City, see TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §\n\n854.202 (West Supp. 2011), but that, at the time Casso resigned, she had accrued only\n\nnine years of service. Casso argued that the City’s advancement to her of benefits\n\nordinarily unavailable to non-retirees evinced an intent on the part of the City to treat her\n\nas a “retiree” for purposes of health insurance coverage.\n\n        8\n           Casso’s live petition alleged that, under the terms of the Plan, health insurance “coverage for\nretirees is not limited” in duration. In fact, the Plan does not explicitly state when a “retiree” participant\nloses his or her eligibility for coverage. The section of the Plan regarding “Participant Termination” states\nonly as follows:\n\n        Participant Coverage shall automatically terminate upon the earliest of the following\n        dates:\n\n        1. Last day of Calendar Month coincident or next following date of termination of\n           employment of Participant. EXCEPT: This shall not apply to a person who qualifies\n           as a Participant due to being an Eligible Retiree; or\n\n        2. Date the Participant ceases to be eligible for coverage; or\n\n        3. Date the Participant fails to pay the required contribution for coverage; or\n\n        4. Date the Plan is terminated; the date of termination of such benefit; or\n\n        5. Date the City terminates coverage for Participant; or\n\n        6. Date the Participant dies.\n\n\n                                                     11\n\f       Second, Casso points to various items of evidence extraneous to the agreement,\n\nincluding: (1) the terms of 2003 Plan, which listed only four classes of participants:\n\nemployee, dependent, retiree, and COBRA; (2) invoices for Casso’s health insurance\n\npremiums between June 2002 and December 2003, which referred to Casso as a\n\n“retiree”; (3) correspondence between the City and Casso, in which the City referred to\n\nCasso’s coverage as “retiree” status; and (4) testimony by Casso that the City agreed to\n\ntreat her as a “retiree” for purposes of health insurance coverage. Casso alleged that,\n\nof the four types of participants defined in the Plan, the only possible category she could\n\nhave fit in was “retiree,” because the release agreement contemplated at least 38\n\nmonths of coverage (i.e., from April 1999 to June 2002) and “[t]he only participants who\n\nmay have post-employment health coverage over 18 months are retirees.” She argued\n\nthat the terms of the Plan therefore required the City to treat her as a “retiree” for\n\npurposes of health insurance eligibility.\n\n       Finally, Casso noted that both she and the City were fully aware of her chronic\n\nhealth condition at the time the release agreement was executed. She contended that\n\nboth parties were also aware of the fact that, due to her condition, she would not be\n\nable to obtain other private health insurance coverage if her City health insurance\n\ncoverage were to be terminated.\n\n       The City contends that evidence of Casso’s health condition and of the terms of\n\nthe Plan was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule. See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum\n\nInt’l, 352 S.W.3d at 451; Baroid Equip., Inc. v. Odeco Drilling, Inc., 184 S.W.3d 1, 13\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (“The parol evidence rule is not a\n\nmere rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive contract law. . . . Evidence violating the\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fparol evidence rule has no legal effect and merely constitutes proof of facts that are\n\nimmaterial and inoperative.”). But the parol evidence rule\n\n        does not prohibit consideration of surrounding circumstances that inform,\n        rather than vary from or contradict, the contract text.            Those\n        circumstances include . . . the commercial or other setting in which the\n        contract was negotiated and other objectively determinable factors that\n        give a context to the transaction between the parties.\n\nHouston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462,\n\n469 (Tex. 2011) (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Here, the release agreement at issue states that, in exchange for Casso’s\n\nrelease of her potential claims against the City, the City would: (1) make a $50,000\n\nlump sum payment to Casso; (2) make a payment to Casso equaling the City’s total\n\ncontributions to her retirement account; and (3) “continue to pay Casso’s health\n\ninsurance premiums for Health Insurance coverage with The City of McAllen throughout\n\nthe period of time from the date of the execution of this Agreement through June 2002.”\n\nBecause the City was obligated to pay Casso’s premiums until June 2002, the City was\n\nalso implicitly obligated to preserve Casso’s eligibility for health insurance coverage until\n\nthat date. However, the agreement does not address—either explicitly or implicitly—the\n\nquestion of whether or when her eligibility for health insurance would be terminated. As\n\nto health insurance eligibility post-June 2002, therefore, the agreement was susceptible\n\nto two reasonable interpretations.9 It was ambiguous as to that particular issue. See\n\nMilner, 361 S.W.3d at 619. Accordingly, we disagree with the City that the agreement\n\nwas unambiguous as a matter of law.\n\n        We also disagree with the City that evidence of Casso’s health condition and of\n\n        9\n         It is noteworthy that the City preserved Casso’s health insurance eligibility until December 2003,\neven though the City’s position is that it was not obligated to preserve Casso’s eligibility beyond June\n2002.\n\n                                                    13\n\fthe terms of the Plan was inadmissible. The Austin Court of Appeals also considered\n\nthe question of ambiguity in an employment contract in Carr v. Christie, 970 S.W.2d 620\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied).         In that case, the parties entered into an\n\nemployment agreement which stated in part that “[t]he term of this agreement shall\n\nbegin on the 1st day of August 1994 and shall continue for a period of one (1) year or\n\nuntil termination as hereinafter provided.”      Id. at 621.     The contract also had a\n\nparagraph entitled “Involuntary Termination” which listed various specific circumstances\n\nunder which the agreement “shall be deemed to be terminated and the employment\n\nrelationship . . . shall be deemed severed . . . .”   Id.   The employee, Carr, was fired\n\nwithout cause after 18 months on the job, and he sued the employer, Christie, for\n\nbreach of contract. Id. Christie argued that Carr’s employment was at-will and that the\n\ncircumstances listed in the “Involuntary Termination” paragraph were not intended to be\n\nexclusive.   Id. at 622.   Carr, on the other hand, argued that Christie breached the\n\ncontract “because the parties intended the quoted language to mean that Carr shall be\n\nemployed for a minimum of one year and thereafter might be discharged only for a\n\nreason specified in [the ‘Involuntary Termination’] paragraph . . . .” Id. The trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Christie, but the court of appeals reversed,\n\nholding that the agreement was ambiguous because both Carr’s and Christie’s\n\ninterpretations of the provisions at issue were reasonable. Id.\n\n       In determining that Carr’s interpretation of the contract was reasonable, the court\n\nof appeals noted that “Carr's interpretation [is not] inconsistent with the circumstances\n\nunder which the contract was written and executed.” Id. The court rejected Christie’s\n\ncontention that consideration of the “circumstances under which the contract was\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fwritten” would run afoul of the parol evidence rule. Id. at 622 n.2. The court noted that:\n\n       In interpreting contracts or clauses set forth in “clear and unambiguous”\n       language, the courts do not confine themselves to a mere inspection of\n       the document. Before committing themselves, the courts carefully\n       examine the surrounding circumstances, prior negotiations, and all other\n       relevant incidents bearing on the intent of the parties . . . .\n\n       Only after a careful and painstaking search of all the factors shedding light\n       on the intent of the parties, only after “turning signs and symbols into\n       equivalent realities” will the court conclude that the language in any given\n       case is “clear and unambiguous.”\n\nId. (quoting 4 W ILLISTON   ON   CONTRACTS § 600A (3rd ed. 1957) (internal citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n       We find, consistent with Carr, that the parol evidence rule was not violated here.\n\nCasso’s chronic health condition and the terms of the Plan constitute evidence of\n\n“objectively determinable factors that give a context to the transaction between the\n\nparties,” which is admissible for purposes of determining if a contract is “clear and\n\nunambiguous.” See Houston Exploration Co., 352 S.W.3d at 469; Carr, 970 S.W.2d at\n\n622 n.2.     Considering that evidence, the trial court was justified in its implicit\n\ndetermination that the contract was susceptible to more than one reasonable\n\ninterpretation. And, a reasonable juror could have concluded from that evidence that\n\nthe parties intended, by the 2003 settlement agreement, for Casso’s health insurance\n\neligibility to be preserved until such time as she obtained other health insurance or was\n\neligible for Medicare. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d 802 at 819 (“Jurors are the sole\n\njudges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. They\n\nmay choose to believe one witness and disbelieve another. Reviewing courts cannot\n\nimpose their own opinions to the contrary.” (Internal citations omitted)).\n\n       The City further argues by its first issue that the trial court was prohibited by\n\n                                            15\n\fstatute from giving effect to any agreement to treat Casso as a “retiree” for purposes of\n\nhealth insurance. Specifically, the City argues that sections 172.002 and 172.004 of the\n\nTexas Local Government Code require that, if a political subdivision chooses to provide\n\nhealth insurance benefits to employees, those benefits must be uniform as to all\n\nemployees. See TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 172.002 (West 2008); id. § 172.004(a)\n\n(West 2008) (“A political subdivision . . . directly or through a risk pool may provide\n\nhealth and accident coverage for political subdivision officials, employees, and retirees\n\nor any class of officials, employees, or retirees, and employees of affiliated service\n\ncontractors.”).    The City also contends that ERISA,10 the federal statute governing\n\nemployee benefit plans, prohibits the enforcement of any agreement to treat Casso as a\n\n“retiree.” See Greathouse v. Glidden Co., 40 S.W.3d 560, 567–68 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.) (“The policy behind the ‘written instrument’ clause in ERISA is\n\nto prevent collusive or fraudulent side agreements between employers and\n\nemployees. . . . Therefore, ERISA precludes all oral modifications and written\n\nmodifications which do not purport to be formal amendments of a plan.”); see also 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1102(a)(1) (“Every employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained\n\npursuant to a written instrument. . . .”).        Again, we disagree.         Nothing in the local\n\ngovernment code or ERISA prohibits a political subdivision from entering into\n\nagreements in which continued access to health insurance coverage is granted in\n\nexchange for the release of disputed claims. ERISA does require that every plan be\n\nadministered in accordance with its establishing instrument, see 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1);\n\nhowever, there is also nothing in the terms of the written Plan at issue that precludes\n\n\n       10\n          ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, which is codified in\nchapter 18 of title 29 of the United States Code. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001–1453.\n\n                                                  16\n\fenforcement of the release agreement. In fact, the Plan states explicitly that “[t]he City\n\nof McAllen shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make any and all factual\n\ndeterminations, Plan interpretations, eligibility and/or other determinations that it deems\n\nnecessary . . . .” The Plan also provides that “the City reserves the right to amend,\n\nsuspend or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time.” The Plan therefore\n\nappears to permit the City to enter into agreements such as the one at issue here. We\n\nare not persuaded by the City’s argument that the agreement is unenforceable under\n\nchapter 27 of the local government code and ERISA.\n\n       Finally, the City argues that any agreement to grant Casso health insurance\n\neligibility was unenforceable due to the statute of frauds. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE\n\nANN. § 26.01(a), (b)(6) (West 2009) (providing that “an agreement which is not to be\n\nperformed within one year from the date of making the agreement” is not enforceable\n\nunless the “agreement, or a memorandum of it, is (1) in writing; and (2) signed by the\n\nperson to be charged with the promise or agreement or by someone lawfully authorized\n\nto sign for him”).    Assuming arguendo that the statute of frauds applies to the\n\nagreement at issue, we find that the release agreement, which was written and was duly\n\nsigned by the City’s attorney, satisfies the statute’s requirements. The mere fact that\n\nthe release agreement was ambiguous as to Casso’s post-2002 health insurance\n\neligibility does not negate the agreement’s written character.\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, see City\n\nof Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, we conclude that there was legally sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s findings that (1) the City agreed to treat Casso as a health\n\ninsurance “retiree” participant until the age of 65, and (2) the City breached that\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fagreement. Additionally, considering the evidence in a neutral light, we find that the\n\nevidence is factually sufficient to support those findings. The City’s first and second\n\nissues are overruled.\n\nB.     Medical Costs Damages\n\n       By its third issue, the City contends the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the award of medical cost damages corresponding to the breach\n\nof contract claim.\n\n       Question 3 of the jury charge asked what sum of money, if paid now in cash,\n\nwould fairly and reasonably compensate Casso for damages resulting from the City’s\n\nbreach of contract. Subsection (a) of question 3 asked the jury to assess “[t]he medical\n\ncosts, if any, paid or incurred by Dahlila Guerra Casso between January 1, 2004 and\n\nthe present, less the sum that Casso would have paid in monthly premiums during that\n\nperiod to obtain coverage under the City of McAllen, Texas health insurance plan.” The\n\njury answered “$38,523.43.” The City first contends by its third issue that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence of the difference between the medical costs incurred by Casso and\n\nthe sum she would have been required to pay for her health insurance coverage\n\nbetween January 1, 2004 and the time of trial. The City specifically claims that no\n\nattempt was made to show what the City’s insurance premium amounts were for retiree\n\nparticipants between January 1, 2004 and the time of trial.\n\n       We find that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s answer to charge\n\nquestion 3(a). Among the pieces of evidence before the jury were billing records from\n\nvarious medical providers that treated Casso during the relevant time period. Those\n\nbills reflected total medical costs of $58,306.19. The jury was also able to consider\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fseveral monthly invoices sent by the City between 2002 and 2003 asking Casso to pay\n\na monthly premium of $215.03.              The jury additionally heard testimony from City\n\nManager Mike Perez that the current monthly premium for a retiree participant is $245.\n\nThe jury could have chosen to disbelieve Perez and instead to believe that the 2002–\n\n2003 monthly invoices reflected the amount Casso would have been charged in monthly\n\npremiums between 2004 and 2011. See id. at 819. We therefore conclude that the jury\n\ncould have reasonably found that Casso suffered $38,523.43 in damages, representing\n\nthe difference between the amount she paid or incurred in medical costs and the\n\namount she would have been required to pay in insurance premiums from January 1,\n\n2004 to the time of trial.11\n\n       The City next argues by its third issue that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nestablish damages under question 3(b) of the jury charge, which asked the jury to\n\nassess:\n\n       The medical costs, if any, that in reasonable probability, would have been\n       or will be incurred by Dahlila Guerra Casso on and after January 1, 2004\n       that would have been actually paid by the City of McAllen, Texas health\n       insurance plan, less the sum that Casso would have paid in monthly\n       premiums during that period to obtain coverage under the City of McAllen,\n       Texas health insurance plan.[12]\n\n       11\n          The amount could have been reasonably calculated as follows: $58,306.19 (Casso’s incurred\nmedical costs between 2004 and 2011) minus $19,782.76 ($215.03 per month for 92 months, between\nJanuary 2004 and August 2011) equals $38,523.43.\n       12\n          As noted, question 3(a) asked the jury to assess the medical costs incurred by Casso between\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the time of trial; whereas question 3(b) asked the jury to assess the amount that\n“would have been” incurred or “will be incurred” by Casso “on and after January 1, 2004 that would have\nbeen actually paid” by the City’s health insurance plan, less the amount Casso would have paid in\npremiums. Question 3(b) therefore arguably invited the jury to award duplicate damages for medical\ncosts incurred by Casso between January 1, 2004 and the time of trial. However, as we noted supra at\nnote 6, the jury was specifically instructed not to award duplicate damages. Moreover, at the charge\nconference, Casso’s counsel set forth his theory as to why the questions did not create a risk of double\nrecovery:\n\n       Number one [question 3(a)] is the actual out of pocket medical costs that [Casso] paid on\n       that charge of $58,000 that we showed the jury. The second one [question 3(b)] is the\n\n                                                  19\n\fThe jury answered “$150,000.00.” The City contends that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto establish that these medical costs “would have been or will be” incurred by Casso.\n\n       Casso’s primary care physician, Michael Jelinek, M.D., testified that he has\n\ntreated Casso for her Lupus condition since 1992.                   He stated that Lupus is an\n\nautoimmune disease without a known cure, so treatment consists primarily of managing\n\na patient’s symptoms. According to Dr. Jelinek, Casso’s Lupus caused her to suffer\n\nsevere joint pain, the inability to walk, hair loss, and various infections. He testified that\n\nhe attempted to treat these symptoms by prescribing an immunomodulator, a\n\nmedication that suppresses the immune system.                          Dr. Jelinek testified that\n\nimmunomodulator therapy costs about $2,000 to $2,500 per infusion and that an\n\ninfusion should be administered every three to four weeks. For Casso’s treatment, Dr.\n\nJelinek prescribed Remicade, an immunomodulator that is administered intravenously.\n\nDr. Jelinek stated that Casso would need an infusion of Remicade—or, if Casso did not\n\nrespond to that medication, another immunomodulator—every three to four weeks for\n\nthe rest of her life.\n\n       The City notes that Casso suffered an adverse reaction to a Remicade infusion in\n\nJuly 2003 and that it was not certain that she would have been able to continue\n\nRemicade treatments beyond December 2003, when her health insurance eligibility was\n\n\n\n       measure of damages—the benefit of the bargain damages. The benefit of the bargain\n       damages are damages that are recoverable in a breach of contract case. And that is\n       what damages would put the Plaintiff in a position that the Plaintiff would have been [in]\n       had the contract been performed. Had the contract been performed she would have\n       received all of these Remicade treatments, for example, and the benefit of the bargain\n       measure is what is set forth there. It’s a description of these medical benefits that she\n       would have received had the contract been performed.\n\nAlthough the City objected at the charge conference on the basis that the submission of question 3(b)\ncreated a risk of double recovery, the City has not raised that issue on appeal.\n\n                                                  20\n\fterminated. The City also notes that Casso had not been prescribed Remicade until\n\n2003 and was using less-expensive medication prior to that time.\n\n       We find the evidence sufficient to support the jury’s answer to question 3(b).\n\nAlthough the City is correct in noting that Casso’s pre-2003 treatments were not as\n\nexpensive as the Remicade infusions, Dr. Jelinek testified that Casso’s condition\n\n“deteriorated substantially since the expiry of her insurance coverage” and that “the\n\nprogression of her illness could have been controlled or slowed down if proper care had\n\nbeen more forthcoming.”        The jury could have therefore reasonably concluded that\n\nRemicade or other immunomodulator treatment was necessary for Casso in the years\n\nbeyond 2003, even if it was not necessary for her before that time.                  Moreover, in\n\ndetermining damages, the jury has discretion to award damages within the range of\n\nevidence presented at trial. Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 566 (Tex.\n\n2002). As Casso notes, the evidence presented at trial could have supported an award\n\nof future medical damages exceeding $400,000, representing a $2,500 Remicade\n\ntreatment minus a $215.03 monthly premium payment every month from 2004 until\n\n2018, when Casso will become eligible for Medicare.13 Of course, the evidence could\n\nhave also supported a conclusion that Casso’s future medical costs were zero because\n\nshe had suffered an adverse reaction to Remicade, and Dr. Jelinek could not say for\n\nsure that post-2003 Remicade treatments would have been possible. But that is not\n\nwhat the jury found—and we cannot and will not substitute our judgment for that of the\n\njury. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, see City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to\n\n       13\n          That amount could be calculated as follows: $450,000 (representing monthly $2,500 Remicade\ntreatments over 180 months, from 2004 to 2018) minus $38,705.40 (representing monthly $215.03\npremium payments over the same time period) equals $411,294.60.\n\n                                                21\n\fsupport an award of $150,000 in medical cost damages under question 3(b). Viewing\n\nthe evidence in a neutral light, see Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176, we find the evidence\n\nfactually sufficient.\n\n        The City additionally complains by its third issue that the trial court failed to\n\nsubmit its requested instruction on mitigation of damages. The mitigation of damages\n\ndoctrine “prevents a party from recovering for damages resulting from a breach of\n\ncontract that could be avoided by reasonable efforts on the part of the plaintiff.” Great\n\nAm. Ins. Co. v. North Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. 1, 908 S.W.2d 415, 426 (Tex. 1995)\n\n(citing Walker v. Salt Flat Water Co., 128 Tex. 140, 96 S.W.2d 231, 232 (1936) (“Where\n\na party is entitled to the benefits of a contract and can save himself from the damages\n\nresulting from its breach at a trifling expense or with reasonable exertions, it is his duty\n\nto incur such expense and make such exertions.”)). A defendant claiming failure to\n\nmitigate damages has the burden of proving lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff,\n\nand the amount by which the damages were increased as a result of the failure to\n\nmitigate. Cocke v. White, 697 S.W.2d 739, 744 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1985, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.).\n\n        We find no error in the trial court’s refusal to submit a mitigation instruction.\n\nCasso testified that, after learning that the City would terminate her health insurance\n\neligibility, she sought alternative health insurance coverage through the State Bar of\n\nTexas but was denied. She also testified that she consulted with her insurance agent\n\nas to the availability of private health insurance. According to Casso, her agent replied\n\n“don’t bother. . . . I don’t know of anybody that’s going to insure you.” The City points to\n\ntestimony by Casso in which she appeared to acknowledge that she might qualify for\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fcertain insurance coverage available on the internet, despite her pre-existing\n\ncondition.14 However, the City was under a burden to produce evidence that Casso\n\nfailed to show diligence in pursuing alternative health insurance. See id. The City failed\n\nin that regard. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on\n\nmitigation of damages.\n\n        The City’s third issue is overruled.\n\nC.      Lost Profits Damages\n\n        By its fourth issue, the City argues that the evidence was insufficient to support\n\nthe award of lost profits damages pursuant to Casso’s breach of contract claim.15\n\n        The City first argues that lost attorney’s fees are not recoverable as a matter of\n\nlaw because they are not a foreseeable consequence of the breach of an unrelated\n\ncontract. The City cites Stuart v. Bayless, where the Texas Supreme Court held that an\n\n\n        14\n            The City’s counsel asked Casso: “Isn’t it true . . . that you’ve become aware of an insurance\npolicy for which you can qualify?” Casso replied: “Am I aware that I can qualify? No. Some [insurance\npolicies] have been mentioned. And I found it very offensive that it was suggested by your client . . . that I\ngo out and secure some insurance off the internet so that the City doesn’t have to provide and keep their\nobligation. . . .” Casso continued:\n\n        If that’s part of the national health care [act] that may be overturned next week or the\n        week after—if that’s what you’re referring to that one court finds unconstitutional and the\n        other upholds, I am not going to take care of—going to do the research because the City\n        has failed me and has breached the contract.\n\nThe parties are apparently referring to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”),\nwhich includes a “guaranteed issue” requirement barring insurers from denying coverage to any person\ndue to that person’s medical condition or history. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-1, 300gg-3, 300gg-4(a).\nAlthough the United States Supreme Court has since upheld the portion of the PPACA containing this\nrequirement, Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2613 (U.S. 2012), we cannot fault\nCasso’s confusion as to the status of the law at the time of trial.\n        15\n            Question 3(c) of the jury charge asked the jury to assess “[t]he net profits, if any, that Dahlila\nGuerra Casso, in reasonable probability would have earned from January 2004 to the present had she\nnot lost the health benefits associated with having health insurance with the City of McAllen, Texas.” The\njury answered “$126,000.00.”\n\n         Question 3(d) asked the jury to assess “[t]he net profits, if any, that [Casso], in reasonable\nprobability would have earned in the future had she not lost the health benefits associated with having\nhealth insurance with the City of McAllen, Texas.” The jury answered “$126,000.00.”\n\n                                                     23\n\fattorney plaintiff, who had sued a former client for failure to pay fees, could not recover\n\nconsequential damages for the loss of potential contingency fees in other unrelated\n\ncases. 964 S.W.2d 920, 921–22 (Tex. 1998) (per curiam). The plaintiff argued that, as\n\nlong as his firm is able to collect an hourly-rate fee from clients, it can financially afford\n\nto take on contingent fee cases, but that the defendant’s failure to pay resulted in the\n\nfirm’s inability to take on other contingent fee matters. Id. at 921. The Court rejected\n\nthat argument, noting that the loss of unrelated contingency fees was not reasonably\n\nforeseeable. Id. (citing Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812,\n\n816 (Tex. 1997)) (stating that consequential damages are those that “result naturally,\n\nbut not necessarily, from the defendant’s wrongful acts”). We find that Stuart does not\n\ncategorically preclude the recovery of attorney’s fees as lost profits; it only precludes the\n\nrecovery of such fees when their loss was not reasonably foreseeable. The defendant\n\nin Stuart could not have reasonably foreseen that her failure to pay the hourly-rate fee\n\nwould have caused the plaintiff’s law firm to refuse other, unrelated contingency-fee\n\ncases.     See id.   Here, in contrast, the City could have reasonably foreseen that\n\nterminating Casso’s health insurance eligibility would have had a deleterious effect on\n\nher earnings. The recovery of attorney’s fees as lost profits was therefore not barred as\n\na matter of law.\n\n         The City next contends by its fourth issue that the evidence adduced at trial was\n\ninsufficient to establish (1) a causal nexus between Casso’s loss of health insurance\n\ncoverage and her lost profits, or (2) the amount of such lost profits. In order to recover\n\nlost profits, a party must produce sufficient competent evidence to enable the fact finder\n\nto determine the net amount of the loss with reasonable certainty. Holt Atherton Indus.,\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fInc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex. 1992); D/FW Commercial Roofing Co. v. Mehra,\n\n854 S.W.2d 182, 187 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1993, no writ). The evidence relative to the\n\nprofits must not be uncertain or speculative. Mehra, 854 S.W.2d at 187 (citing Sw.\n\nBattery Corp. v. Owen, 131 Tex. 423, 426, 115 S.W.2d 1097, 1098 (1938)). However, it\n\nis not necessary that the lost profits be subject to exact calculation. Holt Atherton, 835\n\nS.W.2d at 84.\n\n       What constitutes reasonably certain evidence of lost profits is a fact\n       intensive determination. As a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost\n       profits must be based on objective facts, figures, or data from which the\n       amount of lost profits can be ascertained.           Although supporting\n       documentation may affect the weight of the evidence, it is not necessary\n       to produce in court the documents supporting the opinions or estimates.\n\nERI Consulting Eng’rs, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867, 876 (Tex. 2010) (citations\n\nomitted). Courts have held that a party seeking lost profits damages must show either a\n\nhistory of profitability or the actual existence of future contracts from which lost profits\n\ncan be calculated with reasonable certainty. Allied Bank W. Loop, N.A. v. C.B.D. &\n\nAssocs., Inc., 728 S.W.2d 49, 54–55 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (citing Sw. Battery Corp., 131 Tex. at 423, 115 S.W.2d at 1097).\n\n       To support her claim for lost profits damages, Casso introduced evidence of\n\nprofits from her law practice during the time she was insured, and evidence of her\n\nprofits during the time she was uninsured. When she left the City’s employment in\n\n1999, Casso’s annual salary was $70,000. Casso’s 2002 federal income tax return\n\nshows that she earned $71,938 in business income in that year, during which she was\n\nstill covered by the City’s health insurance. Other income tax returns showed: a loss of\n\n$2,530 in 2004; a profit of $30,991 in 2005; a profit of $18,149 in 2006; a profit of\n\n$6,904 in 2007; a loss of $8,343 in 2008; and a profit of $9,569 in 2009. Thus, Casso\n\n                                            25\n\fearned an average annual profit of $9,123.33 during the years 2004 to 2009, during\n\nwhich she did not have health insurance. The jury awarded $126,000 in past lost\n\nprofits, corresponding to years 2004 through 2011, and $126,000 in future profits,\n\ncorresponding to years 2012 through 2018, when Casso will become eligible for\n\nMedicare.\n\n      The City urges that Casso’s evidence was insufficient because the only evidence\n\nas to a “history of profitability” during the time she was covered by health insurance but\n\nnot employed by the City was her 2002 income tax return.          See id. We disagree.\n\nCasso also introduced evidence that she earned $70,000 in her final year of\n\nemployment as the City’s municipal judge. This evidence, along with the income tax\n\nreturns, constituted “facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits can be\n\nascertained.” See ERI Consulting Eng’rs, 318 S.W.3d at 876. Moreover, the particular\n\namount awarded by the jury was supported by the evidence. As noted, the evidence\n\nshowed that Casso earned an average annual profit of $9,123.33 between 2004 and\n\n2009, but that she earned an average of $70,969 in the years 1999 and 2002. The jury\n\ncould therefore have reasonably concluded that Casso suffered as much as\n\n$61,845.6716 in annual lost profits as a result of the City’s breach. That annual amount\n\nwould result in damages of $494,765.3617 for years 2004 to 2011 and $432,919.6918 for\n\nyears 2012 to 2018. The jury’s award of $126,000 for each of those respective time\n\nperiods therefore did not exceed the amounts supported by the evidence. We further\n\n\n      16\n           $70,969 minus $9,123.33.\n      17\n           $61,845.67 per year for eight years.\n      18\n           $61,845.67 per year for seven years.\n\n\n                                                  26\n\ffind that the evidence—including Dr. Jelinek’s testimony that Casso’s condition\n\ndeteriorated substantially after she lost health insurance—was legally and factually\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s implicit conclusion that Casso’s lost profits resulted from\n\nthe City’s termination of her health insurance eligibility.\n\n       The City’s fourth issue is overruled.\n\nD.     Attorney’s Fees Award\n\n       By its fifth issue, the City argues that the award of $150,000 attorney’s fees to\n\nCasso was erroneous because such fees were not recoverable from the City as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n       The award of attorney’s fees in this case was based on section 38.001 of the civil\n\npractice and remedies code, which provides that a “person may recover reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid\n\nclaim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n\nREM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2008). The question presented here is whether the\n\nCity is an “individual or corporation” for purposes of the statute. In 1986, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court held that the predecessor statute to section 38.001 permitted the\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees against a municipality where those fees were incurred in the\n\ncontext of enforcing a contract made by the municipality in its proprietary capacity. See\n\nGates v. City of Dallas, 704 S.W.2d 737, 738–41 (Tex. 1986) (noting that the defendant\n\ncity “is a home rule municipal corporation” and that, when the city entered into the\n\nunderlying contract with plaintiff, it “acted in its proprietary role and was clothed with the\n\nsame authority and subject to the same liabilities as a private citizen”).\n\n       Apparently in response to that ruling, the Legislature enacted what is now section\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f5.904 of the local government code, which states:               “A municipality may not be\n\nconsidered a corporation under a state statute governing corporations unless the statute\n\nextends its application to a municipality by express use of the term ‘municipal\n\ncorporation,’ ‘municipality,’ ‘city,’ ‘town,’ or ‘village.’”   TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. §\n\n5.904(a) (West 2008); see id. § 5.904(b) (“It is the intent of the legislature that the\n\nlimitation provided by this section apply regardless of whether the municipality is acting\n\nin a governmental or proprietary function.”). This statute effectively amends section\n\n38.001 so that it no longer authorizes the award of attorney’s fees against a\n\nmunicipality. See, e.g., City of Corinth v. NuRock Dev. Inc., 293 S.W.3d 360, 370 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.) (noting that the language of section 38.001 “indicates a\n\nclear legislative intent to exclude government entities from those against whom\n\nattorney’s fees may be recovered under the statute”); City of Alton v. Sharyland Water\n\nSupply Corp., 277 S.W.3d 132, 147 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2009) (“[A]\n\nmunicipality . . . is not considered a corporation even when it is acting in its proprietary\n\nfunction.”), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, Sharyland Water Supply\n\nCorp. v. City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d 407 (Tex. 2011); City of Dallas v. Arnett, 762 S.W.2d\n\n942, 951 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied).\n\n       Casso argues that the City did not preserve this issue for review because its only\n\nobjection to the attorney’s fees question in the jury charge was based on chapter 271 of\n\nthe local government code. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Exxon Corp. v. Allsup, 808\n\nS.W.2d 648, 655 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1991, writ denied) (“An objection at trial\n\nwhich is not the same as the objection urged on appeal presents nothing for appellate\n\nreview.”); see also TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. ch. 271 (West 2005 & Supp. 2011)\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f(waiving governmental immunity for certain contract claims). However, prior to rendition\n\nof the final judgment, the City filed a supplemental response to Casso’s “Motion to Sign\n\nJudgment” in which it urged that “counties and cities are not individuals or corporations\n\nand, as such, a party may not recover attorney’s fees against them under the statute.”\n\nThe City cited the relevant statutory and case law in advancing that argument. It also\n\nmade this argument in its “Motion to Modify, Correct or Reform Judgment” filed after the\n\nfinal judgment was rendered.\n\n       We conclude that the issue has been preserved, see TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a), and\n\nthat it is meritorious. We therefore sustain the City’s fifth issue and modify the judgment\n\nto delete the attorney’s fees award.\n\nE.     Pre-Judgment Interest\n\n       By its sixth issue, the City argues that the award of pre-judgment interest on the\n\naward of medical cost damages pursuant to jury charge question 3(b) was\n\nimpermissible because the award was attributable in part to future medical costs. See\n\nTEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 304.1045 (“Prejudgment interest may not be assessed or\n\nrecovered on an award of future damages.”).\n\n       In response, Casso argues that the issue has not been preserved because the\n\nCity did not object to question 3(b) on the basis that two questions—one addressing\n\npast medical costs and one addressing future medical costs—should instead be\n\nsubmitted. Casso further contends that the issue lacks merit because the jury’s award\n\nof $150,000 in medical cost damages in response to question 3(b) could have been\n\nentirely attributable, under the evidence, to pre-trial medical costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       We disagree that the issue has not been preserved.             Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 274 states:     “A party objecting to a charge must point out distinctly the\n\nobjectionable matter and the grounds of the objection. Any complaint as to a question,\n\ndefinition, or instruction, on account of any defect, omission, or fault in pleading, is\n\nwaived unless specifically included in the objections.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 274. At the\n\ncharge conference, the City objected to the submission of question 3(b) on the basis\n\nthat it permitted double recovery of medical cost damages incurred by Casso between\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the date of trial. The City’s counsel argued: “I think what the\n\nCourt needs to say is that the first one [question 3(a)] is medical costs paid or incurred\n\nbetween January 2004 and the present. And the second one [question 3(b)] should say\n\nthe medical costs that will be incurred in reasonable probability from today forward . . . .”\n\n       In any event, the City is not, strictly speaking, challenging any element of the jury\n\ncharge by its sixth issue.     It does not claim that question 3(b) should have been\n\nbifurcated, and it does not claim that future damages should not have been submitted or\n\nawarded.    Instead, the City is merely claiming that the trial court should not have\n\nawarded pre-judgment interest on an award of medical cost damages that\n\nencompassed both past and future costs. Therefore, the more stringent preservation\n\nrequirements found in Rule 274 do not apply. Instead, to preserve the pre-judgment\n\ninterest issue, the City was required only to make a timely complaint to the trial court\n\nthat comports with its complaint on appeal. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Exxon Corp., 808\n\nS.W.2d at 655.     And, the City specifically objected to the award of pre-judgment\n\ninterest—on the same basis as it now raises on appeal—in its post-trial “Motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fCorrect, Modify or Reform Judgment.” Accordingly, the issue has been preserved for\n\nour review.\n\n       We further agree with the City that the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment\n\ninterest on the amount awarded by the jury in response to charge question 3(b),\n\nbecause past and future damages were not segregated. In Cavnar v. Quality Control\n\nParking, Inc., the Texas Supreme Court held that, because certain plaintiffs were\n\nawarded damages for both their past and their future losses in lump sums and past\n\nlosses were not segregated from future losses, those plaintiffs were not entitled to\n\nrecover pre-judgment interest on those elements of damages. 696 S.W.2d 549, 556\n\n(Tex. 1985).19 The same result holds here. Because past and future damages were\n\nsubmitted to the jury but were not segregated in the damages question at issue, Casso\n\nis not entitled to pre-judgment interest on the amount awarded pursuant to that\n\nquestion. See id.; KMG Kanal-Muller-Gruppe Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG v. Davis,\n\n175 S.W.3d 379, 396–97 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.); Casteel v.\n\nCrown Life Ins. Co., 3 S.W.3d 582, 596 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997), rev’d in part on other\n\ngrounds, 22 S.W.3d 378, 391 (Tex. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n       19\n            Cavnar has been superseded by statute in wrongful death, personal injury, and property\ndamage cases. KMG Kanal-Muller-Gruppe Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG v. Davis, 175 S.W.3d 379, 397\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.); see TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 304.101 (West 2006).\nAdditionally, the Texas Supreme Court modified the common law pre-judgment interest rules set forth in\nCavnar to conform with the statute governing pre-judgment interest in wrongful death, personal injury,\nand property damage cases. See Johnson & Higgins of Tex. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507,\n528 (Tex. 1998). However, where damages are awarded for economic injury rather than for personal\ninjury, Cavnar still controls. Davis, 175 S.W.3d at 397. Moreover, the modifications made in Johnson &\nHiggins do not affect the viability of Cavnar with regard to award of pre-judgment interest on damages\nawards that are not segregated between past and future damages.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f        We sustain the City’s sixth issue and modify the judgment to delete the award of\n\npre-judgment interest on the $150,000 awarded as damages under jury charge question\n\n3(b).\n\nF.      Specific Performance\n\n        By its seventh issue, the City argues that the trial court erred in commanding the\n\nCity to specifically perform the contract at issue by enrolling Casso on its health\n\ninsurance plan.    The City urges that this remedy violated the one-satisfaction rule.\n\nAgain, we agree. Specific performance is an equitable remedy that may be awarded\n\nupon a showing of breach of contract. Stafford v. S. Vanity Magazine, Inc., 231 S.W.3d\n\n530, 535 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied). Specific performance is used as a\n\nsubstitute for monetary damages when such damages would not be adequate. Id. The\n\none-satisfaction rule provides that a plaintiff is entitled to only one recovery for any\n\ndamages suffered. See Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 390; Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling,\n\n822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex. 1991).       The related doctrine of election of remedies bars a\n\nplaintiff from recovering both damages for breach of a contract and specific\n\nperformance of the contract. See NRG Exploration v. Rauch, 905 S.W.2d 405, 410\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1995, writ denied); Seegers v. Spradley, 522 S.W.2d 951, 957 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Beaumont 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Redding v. Ferguson, 501 S.W.2d 717,\n\n720 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1973, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (concluding that when party\n\nobtains final judgment for damages, party can no longer demand specific performance\n\nof contract).\n\n        Here, the final judgment awarded a total of $440,523.43 in actual damages. That\n\nsum included $150,000 awarded pursuant to the jury’s answer to charge question 3(b),\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fwhich    asked      the   jury   to    assess     all   “medical     costs . . . that   in   reasonable\n\nprobability . . . will be incurred by [Casso] on and after January 1, 2004 that would have\n\nbeen actually paid by the [City’s] health insurance plan,” less the amount that Casso\n\nwould expend in premium payments. The provision of the final judgment commanding\n\nthe City to enroll Casso on its health insurance plan remedies exactly the same\n\ndamages—i.e., coverage of Casso’s medical costs, minus her premium payments,\n\nthrough 2018. The award of specific performance was therefore in violation of the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule.20 We sustain the City’s seventh issue and modify the judgment to\n\ndelete the award of specific performance.\n\nG.      Fraud Claim\n\n        By its final five issues, the City argues that the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment on the jury’s fraud verdict.21 Specifically, the City contends by its eighth issue\n\nthat that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that the City committed\n\nfraud; by its ninth issue that the trial court erred by considering the jury’s finding that\n\nCasso was entitled to past lost profits as a result of the fraud; by its tenth issue that the\n\n        20\n           The City also claims by its seventh issue that specific performance was unavailable to Casso\nbecause she did not establish: (1) that she was ready, willing, and able to perform her obligations under\nthe contract; or (2) that her remedy at law was inadequate. See DiGiuseppe v. Lawler, 269 S.W.3d 588,\n593 (Tex. 2008) (“An essential element in obtaining the equitable remedy of specific performance is that\nthe party seeking such relief must plead and prove he was ready, willing, and able to timely perform his\nobligations under the contract.”); City of Alton v. Sharyland Water Supply Corp., 277 S.W.3d 132, 147\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2009) (“It is a fundamental rule of equity that a court will not grant specific\nperformance unless it is shown that an adequate remedy does not exist at law.”), aff’d in part and rev’d in\npart on other grounds, Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v. City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d 407 (Tex. 2011). We\nneed not address these sub-issues because of our conclusion that the award of specific performance\nviolated the one-satisfaction rule. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n        21\n           We note that there appears to be some confusion as to what alleged fraud Casso attempted to\nprove at trial. Casso’s live petition characterized her fraud claim as one for fraudulent inducement; she\nalleged that she was induced into signing the agreement because “[t]he City represented to Casso that its\noriginal COBRA proposal would not be part of the agreement after Casso expressly rejected that\nproposal.” On the other hand, on appeal, both parties confine their arguments regarding the fraud claim\nto the facts surrounding Casso’s execution of the blank “Enrollment/Change/Cancellation Form” at the\nCity’s request in 2001. We need not resolve the confusion because of our conclusion herein that any\nerror corresponding to the fraud judgment would not be reversible. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a), 47.1.\n\n                                                   33\n\fevidence of fraud was not clear and convincing; by its eleventh issue that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence supporting the award of exemplary damages 22; and by its twelfth\n\nissue that the fraud claim was barred by limitations.\n\n       We need not address these issues because the only damages actually awarded\n\npursuant to the fraud verdict were past lost profit damages of $126,000, and this award,\n\nas we have concluded, was also justified by the breach of contract finding. Accordingly,\n\neven if we were to find error with respect to each of the City’s five issues regarding the\n\nfraud verdict, those errors would not be reversible. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a) (stating\n\nthat, in a civil case, “[n]o judgment may be reversed on appeal on the ground that the\n\ntrial court made an error of law unless the court of appeals concludes that the error\n\ncomplained of:        (1) probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment; or (2)\n\nprobably prevented the appellant from properly presenting the case to the court of\n\nappeals”); TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1 (“The court of appeals must hand down a written opinion\n\nthat is as brief as practicable but that addresses every issue raised and necessary to\n\nfinal disposition of the appeal.”). The City’s eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\n\nissues are overruled.\n\n                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as modified herein. See TEX. R.

The\n\nCity was ordered to pay over $440,000 in damages and $150,000 in attorney’s fees,\n\fand it was ordered to specifically perform its duties under the contract at issue. On\n\nappeal, the City contends by twelve issues that the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment on the jury’s verdict. We will affirm the judgment as modified.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Casso was appointed by the City in 1990 to be the presiding judge of its\n\nmunicipal court.     In 1991, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n(“Lupus”), an autoimmune disorder with no known cure. Casso was reappointed as\n\nmunicipal judge several times, but decided to resign in 1999. At that time, she informed\n\nthe City that she believed her health condition had been aggravated by unsanitary\n\nconditions at the building in which she worked. She indicated to City officials that she\n\nwould be amenable to releasing whatever claims she had against the City in exchange\n\nfor, among other things, continued health insurance coverage.           Accordingly, Casso\n\nnegotiated an agreement with the City in which she promised to release the City “from\n\nany type of claim, demand, and cause of action whatsoever arising out of her\n\nemployment or that could have been brought by her, relating to her employment or her\n\nseparation . . . .” The agreement further stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n       1. CONSIDERATION\n\n       In consideration for the promise made by Casso in this Agreement, the\n       City agrees to the following payments and/or benefits referred herein as\n       “Consideration”: a lump sum payment equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars\n       ($50,000.00) plus an amount equal to the City’s total contributions to\n       Casso’s [Texas Municipal Retirement System] account as of the date of\n       the execution of this Agreement. In addition, the City will continue to pay\n       Casso’s health insurance premiums for Health Insurance coverage with\n       The City of McAllen throughout the period of time from the date of the\n       execution of this Agreement through June 2002.\n\n              ....\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       5. NATURE OF CONSIDERATION\n\n       Casso understands and acknowledges that the settlement payments\n       hereunder are for the alleged mental anguish and physical sickness she\n       has claimed, associated with the aggravation of her physical disability,\n       Lupus. Casso understands that the City denies the claims she has\n       asserted.\n\n               ....\n\n       16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\n       This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, covenant, and\n       consideration between the parties. There was no reliance upon any other\n       representation, statement, consideration, covenant, promise, or\n       agreement not contained in the Agreement for the covenant made in these\n       documents.\n\n       17. REPRESENTATIONS BY CASSO\n\n       In return for the Consideration, Casso represents the following to the City:\n       (1) I am legally competent to execute this Agreement; (2) in making this\n       settlement and with respect to the Agreement, I have had the benefit of\n       advise [sic] of counsel chosen by me; (3) no promise or representation of\n       any kind has been made to me by the City, or by anyone acting for the\n       City, except as is expressly stated in the Agreement; . . . (7) I understand\n       that the Agreement represents and contains the entire agreement\n       between the parties hereto . . . .\n\nCasso, acting on her own behalf and without independent legal counsel, executed the\n\nrelease agreement along with the City’s attorney on April 12, 1999.\n\n       In accordance with the agreement, the City paid Casso $128,000,1 and it paid\n\nher health insurance premiums until June 1, 2002. At that time, Casso began making\n\nthe monthly premium payments. The City believed, however, that it was not obligated\n\nunder the agreement to keep Casso enrolled indefinitely on its insurance plan, even if\n\nCasso continued to make the premium payments. Instead, the City believed that Casso\n\n\n       1\n         This sum included the $50,000 lump sum and $78,000 representing the City’s contributions to\nCasso’s retirement account.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fwould be eligible for 18 months of post-employment health insurance coverage through\n\nCOBRA, beginning in June 2002.2              In 2001, the City sent Casso a form entitled\n\n“Enrollment/Change/Cancellation Form” and it asked that Casso sign it. Casso testified:\n\n       I was asked to come by the insurance department and talk to Becky and\n       another young lady that were there. I was told that I needed to sign that\n       form. And I was—I said, why. And I joked with them about never signing\n       a form that was blank. But I was told that was so that they could enroll me\n       on the new—I think they went from TML [Texas Municipal League] to\n       TASB [Texas Association of School Boards] or—there had been a change\n       in their third party—in their carrier or whatever they were called.[3] And it\n       seemed innocent enough to me. And then I did read the portion where I\n       signed and even that was an innocent—I joked with them. I said you want\n       me to sign so they can take money from my payroll—from my paycheck\n       but I wasn’t getting a paycheck from the City. So it really—you know, if I\n       was going to continue my insurance it didn’t make a difference to me\n       whether I signed that or not. It had—in my opinion it had no value. They\n       were asking me to sign something just so they could continue to process\n       my insurance and keep me current. And they had me sign something that\n       says I authorize the City of McAllen to take money from my paycheck or to\n       make a payroll deduction.\n\nCasso signed the blank form on a signature line underneath the following statement: “I\n\nauthorize my employer to make the appropriate payroll deductions as a result of this\n\nenrollment and/or change.” The City then forwarded the form to TASB, its third-party\n\nclaims administrator, along with a letter from Rebecca Ramirez, the City’s benefits\n\ncoordinator, explaining that Casso was enrolling in COBRA health insurance coverage.\n\nThe letter, which was admitted into evidence at trial, claimed that Casso is “eligible for\n\nC[OBRA] benefits effective July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003.” The form, as\n\n\n       2\n           “COBRA” refers to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. See 42\nU.S.C. §§ 300bb-1–300bb-8. Section 300bb-1(a) of COBRA applies to health insurance plans\nmaintained by state and local governmental units. Id. § 300bb-1(a). It requires that such plans permit\nemployees who lose coverage as a result of a “qualifying event,” such as termination of employment, to\nelect to continue coverage for up to 18 months following the “qualifying event.” Id.\n       3\n         The evidence showed that the health insurance plan at issue was maintained by the City itself\nand that there was no separate insurance “carrier.”       The City did, however, use third-party\nadministrators—including, at various times, TML and TASB—to process claims under the plan.\n\n                                                  4\n\fsent to TASB, had the words “Cobra Coverage” handwritten on a line next to the words\n\n“Qualifying Event.” Casso stated that she did not intend for the form to be used to enroll\n\nher in COBRA, because she believed she was still entitled, under the agreement, to be\n\ncovered by the City’s insurance plan as long as she paid the premiums.4\n\n        Despite the fact that Casso continued to make the premium payments, the City\n\nterminated her health insurance coverage at the end of December 2003. Casso later\n\nsued the City, claiming that the City was obligated under the release agreement to keep\n\nher on its health insurance plan until she turned 65, at which point she would be eligible\n\nfor Medicare. The trial court initially granted a plea to the jurisdiction in favor of the City,\n\nbut we reversed.        Casso v. City of McAllen, No. 13-08-00618-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 2049, at *22–23 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\n\n(holding that “the City was performing a proprietary function in providing Casso with\n\nhealth insurance coverage; therefore, the City is not entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity”).\n\n        At trial, Casso testified that, after the City terminated her coverage, she applied\n\nfor health insurance through the State Bar of Texas but was denied. She also made\n\nseveral other unsuccessful attempts to obtain health insurance coverage. Casso stated\n\n\n        4\n            Eventually, Casso learned that she was ineligible for COBRA coverage as of June 1, 2002,\nbecause more than 18 months had passed since the applicable “qualifying event”—i.e., the termination of\nher employment. See id. § 300bb-2(2)(A)(i) (stating that, where the “qualifying event” is termination of\nemployment or reduced hours, the “maximum required period” of continued coverage is “the date which is\n18 months after the date of the qualifying event”); § 300bb-3 (stating that a “qualifying event” means “any\nof the following events which, but for the continuation coverage required under this subchapter, would\nresult in the loss of coverage of a qualified beneficiary: (1) The death of the covered employee[;] (2) The\ntermination (other than by reason of such employee’s gross misconduct), or reduction of hours, of the\ncovered employee’s employment[;] (3) The divorce or legal separation of the covered employee from the\nemployee’s spouse[;] (4) The covered employee becoming entitled to benefits under title XVIII of the\nSocial Security Act[;] (5) A dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child under the generally\napplicable requirements of the plan.”). The City’s staff was mistaken in its belief that, under COBRA, the\n“qualifying event” was the termination of Casso’s fully-paid health insurance coverage on June 1, 2002.\nSee id. § 300bb-3.\n\n                                                    5\n\fthat she has gone without health insurance coverage since December 2003.                She\n\nidentified evidence of several large medical bills she paid out-of-pocket since then.\n\n       Casso conceded on cross-examination that, if a City employee resigns, he or she\n\nwould not ordinarily be entitled to continued health insurance coverage beyond access\n\nto COBRA.     She also stated that she specifically negotiated certain terms of the\n\nsettlement agreement. In particular, Casso demanded that the agreement state that\n\nshe resigned her position and was not terminated; she demanded that the agreement\n\nstate that the compensation was for “aggravation” of her Lupus condition; and she\n\ndemanded that the agreement make no reference to her potential COBRA eligibility.\n\n       Casso agreed with the City’s counsel that the City had complied with the release\n\nagreement’s express requirements that it (1) pay her $50,000, (2) pay her an amount\n\nequal to the contributions made by the City to her retirement account, and (3) pay her\n\nhealth insurance premiums up until June 2002.         Casso argued, however, that the\n\nagreement contained an additional implied term—namely, that the City was required to\n\nmaintain her eligibility to buy into the health insurance plan until such time as she\n\nbecame eligible for Medicare—which the City violated by unilaterally terminating her\n\ncoverage at the end of December 2003.\n\n       Casso’s theory was that the agreement was ambiguous because, while it\n\nspecified the date upon which the City would stop paying her insurance premiums, it did\n\nnot specify the date upon which her ability to buy into the plan—that is, her ability to\n\nmaintain enrollment in the plan while paying her own premiums—would be terminated.\n\nCasso urged that the ambiguity could be resolved by considering the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the formation of the agreement; in particular, she noted that, at the time of\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe agreement, the City was fully aware of her medical condition and her need for\n\ncontinuous health insurance coverage.\n\n        Casso also argued that the ambiguity could be resolved by referring to the City’s\n\n2003 “Employee Benefit Plan” (the “Plan”). The Plan, which was entered into evidence,\n\ndefines four different categories of “participant”: (1) a regular full-time employee; (2) a\n\nspouse or child of a participant; (3) a retired employee “who meets the requirements set\n\nforth in this Plan”5; or (4) a COBRA participant. Casso reasoned that, because she was\n\nno longer a full-time employee and because COBRA is legally available for only 18\n\nmonths post-employment, she must have been covered as a “retiree” participant from\n\n1999 until December 2003. She further claimed that, under the terms of the plan, a\n\n“retiree” is entitled to buy in to coverage until the time he or she turns 65 years old and\n\nbecomes eligible for Medicare. She argued that the City breached the agreement by\n\nterminating her access to coverage prior to age 65.\n\n        The City contended that the agreement was unambiguous and it filed a motion in\n\nlimine seeking to exclude, among other things, extraneous evidence regarding the\n\nterms of the agreement. The City also filed a motion to exclude any evidence of an oral\n\nagreement on parol evidence grounds. The trial court denied the motions, thereby\n\nimplicitly concluding as a matter of law that the agreement was ambiguous. See Anglo-\n\nDutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895367\"><a href=\"/opinion/895367/anglo-dutch-petroleum-v-greenberg-peden/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451 (Tex. 2011)\n\n        5\n         The Plan defines a retiree “participant” as “[a] person who is an Eligible SB 404 Retiree of the\nCity who has: 1) 28 years of service, or 2) 25 years of service and age 50, or 3) 10 years of service and\nage 60.” “Eligible SB 404 Retiree” apparently refers to Texas Local Government Code chapter 175,\nwhich was originally enacted as Senate Bill 404. See Act of June 15, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 663, § 1,\n1993 TEX. SESS. LAW . SERV. 2462, 2463–64 (amended 1995, 2009) (current version at TEX. LOC. GOV’T\nCODE ANN. §§ 175.001–.007 (West Supp. 2011)). That chapter provides, among other things, that a\nperson who retires from a municipality with a population of 25,000 or more and is “entitled to receive\nretirement benefits from a . . . municipal retirement plan” is entitled to purchase continued health\ninsurance coverage from the municipality.

The jury\n\nawarded damages as follows: $38,523.43 for medical costs incurred by Casso between\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the time of trial; $150,000 for medical costs incurred on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 which the City’s insurance plan would have paid; $126,000 in past net\n\nprofits; and $126,000 in future net profits. The jury further found that the City committed\n\nfraud against Casso and awarded an additional $126,000 in damages representing\n\nfuture net profits.6 Casso filed a “Motion to Sign Judgment” in accordance with the\n\nverdict. The trial court granted the motion and rendered final judgment awarding Casso\n\n$440,523.43 in actual damages, $8,705.20 in court costs, $150,000 in attorney’s fees,\n\nand pre- and post-judgment interest.7 The final judgment further stated:\n\n        [T]his Court also enters judgment on the equitable remedy of specific\n        performance and [the City] is hereby ordered to enroll [Casso] on its\n        current health insurance plan as a “Retiree Participant” within three (3)\n\n        6\n         A majority of the jury also found fraud by clear and convincing evidence and awarded Casso\n$300,000 in exemplary damages. However, that finding was not unanimous and so judgment was not\nrendered thereon. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 41.003(e) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n         Moreover, the $126,000 in future net profits awarded as fraud damages was not included in the\nfinal judgment, presumably because $126,000 in future net profits damages had already been awarded\npursuant to the breach of contract finding. This is despite the fact that the jury was instructed in the\ndamages questions as follows: “You shall not award any sum of money on any element if you have\notherwise, under some other element, awarded a sum of money for the same loss. That is, do not\ncompensate twice for the same loss, if any.”\n        7\n          Pre-judgment interest was awarded only on “$314,523.43 in past damages.” This amount\nincludes all of the damages awarded except those attributable to future net profits. Post-judgment\ninterest was awarded on the entire amount of damages, plus all fees, costs, and pre-judgment interest\nawarded in the judgment, amounting to $659,460.38.\n\n                                                   8\n\f       days of the date of this Judgment and [Casso] is ordered to pay monthly\n       premiums of $245 beginning the first day of the month following the date\n       of this Judgment.

See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 329b(c). This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Breach of Contract Claim\n\n       By its first issue, the City contends that there was legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that it agreed to treat Casso as a “retiree” for\n\npurposes of her post-employment health insurance coverage. By its second issue, the\n\nCity urges that there was legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the finding\n\nthat the City breached its obligations under any such agreement.\n\n       1.

Analysis\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f        The City argues that the agreement was unambiguous as a matter of law and\n\nthat parol evidence was, therefore, inadmissible to establish its terms. It contends that,\n\nwithout such parol evidence, there was legally and factually insufficient evidentiary\n\nsupport for the jury’s finding that the City breached its contract with Casso.\n\n        At trial, Casso advanced several arguments as to why the agreement was\n\nambiguous. First, she contended that because the City agreed to pay her the entire\n\namount it contributed to her retirement account, the City must therefore have intended\n\nto treat her as a “retiree.”8 She notes that a City employee ordinarily must accrue at\n\nleast ten years of service before he or she is “vested” and eligible to receive the\n\nretirement contributions previously made by the City, see TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §\n\n854.202 (West Supp. 2011), but that, at the time Casso resigned, she had accrued only\n\nnine years of service. Casso argued that the City’s advancement to her of benefits\n\nordinarily unavailable to non-retirees evinced an intent on the part of the City to treat her\n\nas a “retiree” for purposes of health insurance coverage.\n\n        8\n           Casso’s live petition alleged that, under the terms of the Plan, health insurance “coverage for\nretirees is not limited” in duration. In fact, the Plan does not explicitly state when a “retiree” participant\nloses his or her eligibility for coverage. The section of the Plan regarding “Participant Termination” states\nonly as follows:\n\n        Participant Coverage shall automatically terminate upon the earliest of the following\n        dates:\n\n        1. Last day of Calendar Month coincident or next following date of termination of\n           employment of Participant. EXCEPT: This shall not apply to a person who qualifies\n           as a Participant due to being an Eligible Retiree; or\n\n        2. Date the Participant ceases to be eligible for coverage; or\n\n        3. Date the Participant fails to pay the required contribution for coverage; or\n\n        4. Date the Plan is terminated; the date of termination of such benefit; or\n\n        5. Date the City terminates coverage for Participant; or\n\n        6. Date the Participant dies.\n\n\n                                                     11\n\f       Second, Casso points to various items of evidence extraneous to the agreement,\n\nincluding: (1) the terms of 2003 Plan, which listed only four classes of participants:\n\nemployee, dependent, retiree, and COBRA; (2) invoices for Casso’s health insurance\n\npremiums between June 2002 and December 2003, which referred to Casso as a\n\n“retiree”; (3) correspondence between the City and Casso, in which the City referred to\n\nCasso’s coverage as “retiree” status; and (4) testimony by Casso that the City agreed to\n\ntreat her as a “retiree” for purposes of health insurance coverage. Casso alleged that,\n\nof the four types of participants defined in the Plan, the only possible category she could\n\nhave fit in was “retiree,” because the release agreement contemplated at least 38\n\nmonths of coverage (i.e., from April 1999 to June 2002) and “[t]he only participants who\n\nmay have post-employment health coverage over 18 months are retirees.” She argued\n\nthat the terms of the Plan therefore required the City to treat her as a “retiree” for\n\npurposes of health insurance eligibility.\n\n       Finally, Casso noted that both she and the City were fully aware of her chronic\n\nhealth condition at the time the release agreement was executed. She contended that\n\nboth parties were also aware of the fact that, due to her condition, she would not be\n\nable to obtain other private health insurance coverage if her City health insurance\n\ncoverage were to be terminated.\n\n       The City contends that evidence of Casso’s health condition and of the terms of\n\nthe Plan was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.

However, the agreement does not address—either explicitly or implicitly—the\n\nquestion of whether or when her eligibility for health insurance would be terminated. As\n\nto health insurance eligibility post-June 2002, therefore, the agreement was susceptible\n\nto two reasonable interpretations.9 It was ambiguous as to that particular issue. See\n\nMilner, 361 S.W.3d at 619. Accordingly, we disagree with the City that the agreement\n\nwas unambiguous as a matter of law.\n\n        We also disagree with the City that evidence of Casso’s health condition and of\n\n        9\n         It is noteworthy that the City preserved Casso’s health insurance eligibility until December 2003,\neven though the City’s position is that it was not obligated to preserve Casso’s eligibility beyond June\n2002.\n\n                                                    13\n\fthe terms of the Plan was inadmissible.

App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied).         In that case, the parties entered into an\n\nemployment agreement which stated in part that “[t]he term of this agreement shall\n\nbegin on the 1st day of August 1994 and shall continue for a period of one (1) year or\n\nuntil termination as hereinafter provided.”      Id. at 621.     The contract also had a\n\nparagraph entitled “Involuntary Termination” which listed various specific circumstances\n\nunder which the agreement “shall be deemed to be terminated and the employment\n\nrelationship . . . shall be deemed severed . . . .”   Id.   The employee, Carr, was fired\n\nwithout cause after 18 months on the job, and he sued the employer, Christie, for\n\nbreach of contract. Id. Christie argued that Carr’s employment was at-will and that the\n\ncircumstances listed in the “Involuntary Termination” paragraph were not intended to be\n\nexclusive.   Id. at 622.   Carr, on the other hand, argued that Christie breached the\n\ncontract “because the parties intended the quoted language to mean that Carr shall be\n\nemployed for a minimum of one year and thereafter might be discharged only for a\n\nreason specified in [the ‘Involuntary Termination’] paragraph . . . .” Id. The trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Christie, but the court of appeals reversed,\n\nholding that the agreement was ambiguous because both Carr’s and Christie’s\n\ninterpretations of the provisions at issue were reasonable. Id.\n\n       In determining that Carr’s interpretation of the contract was reasonable, the court\n\nof appeals noted that “Carr's interpretation [is not] inconsistent with the circumstances\n\nunder which the contract was written and executed.” Id. The court rejected Christie’s\n\ncontention that consideration of the “circumstances under which the contract was\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fwritten” would run afoul of the parol evidence rule. Id. at 622 n.2. The court noted that:\n\n       In interpreting contracts or clauses set forth in “clear and unambiguous”\n       language, the courts do not confine themselves to a mere inspection of\n       the document. Before committing themselves, the courts carefully\n       examine the surrounding circumstances, prior negotiations, and all other\n       relevant incidents bearing on the intent of the parties . . . .\n\n       Only after a careful and painstaking search of all the factors shedding light\n       on the intent of the parties, only after “turning signs and symbols into\n       equivalent realities” will the court conclude that the language in any given\n       case is “clear and unambiguous.”\n\nId. (quoting 4 W ILLISTON   ON   CONTRACTS § 600A (3rd ed. 1957) (internal citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n       We find, consistent with Carr, that the parol evidence rule was not violated here.\n\nCasso’s chronic health condition and the terms of the Plan constitute evidence of\n\n“objectively determinable factors that give a context to the transaction between the\n\nparties,” which is admissible for purposes of determining if a contract is “clear and\n\nunambiguous.” See Houston Exploration Co., 352 S.W.3d at 469; Carr, 970 S.W.2d at\n\n622 n.2.     Considering that evidence, the trial court was justified in its implicit\n\ndetermination that the contract was susceptible to more than one reasonable\n\ninterpretation. And, a reasonable juror could have concluded from that evidence that\n\nthe parties intended, by the 2003 settlement agreement, for Casso’s health insurance\n\neligibility to be preserved until such time as she obtained other health insurance or was\n\neligible for Medicare. See City of Keller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 819 (“Jurors are the sole\n\njudges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. They\n\nmay choose to believe one witness and disbelieve another. Reviewing courts cannot\n\nimpose their own opinions to the contrary.” (Internal citations omitted)).\n\n       The City further argues by its first issue that the trial court was prohibited by\n\n                                            15\n\fstatute from giving effect to any agreement to treat Casso as a “retiree” for purposes of\n\nhealth insurance. Specifically, the City argues that sections 172.002 and 172.004 of the\n\nTexas Local Government Code require that, if a political subdivision chooses to provide\n\nhealth insurance benefits to employees, those benefits must be uniform as to all\n\nemployees. See TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 172.002 (West 2008); id. § 172.004(a)\n\n(West 2008) (“A political subdivision . . . directly or through a risk pool may provide\n\nhealth and accident coverage for political subdivision officials, employees, and retirees\n\nor any class of officials, employees, or retirees, and employees of affiliated service\n\ncontractors.”).    The City also contends that ERISA,10 the federal statute governing\n\nemployee benefit plans, prohibits the enforcement of any agreement to treat Casso as a\n\n“retiree.” See Greathouse v. Glidden Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2337143\"><a href=\"/opinion/2337143/greathouse-v-glidden-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567–68 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.) (“The policy behind the ‘written instrument’ clause in ERISA is\n\nto prevent collusive or fraudulent side agreements between employers and\n\nemployees. . . . Therefore, ERISA precludes all oral modifications and written\n\nmodifications which do not purport to be formal amendments of a plan.”); see also 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1102(a)(1) (“Every employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained\n\npursuant to a written instrument. . . .”).        Again, we disagree.         Nothing in the local\n\ngovernment code or ERISA prohibits a political subdivision from entering into\n\nagreements in which continued access to health insurance coverage is granted in\n\nexchange for the release of disputed claims. ERISA does require that every plan be\n\nadministered in accordance with its establishing instrument, see 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1);\n\nhowever, there is also nothing in the terms of the written Plan at issue that precludes\n\n\n       10\n          ERISA refers to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, which is codified in\nchapter 18 of title 29 of the United States Code. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001–1453.\n\n                                                  16\n\fenforcement of the release agreement. In fact, the Plan states explicitly that “[t]he City\n\nof McAllen shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make any and all factual\n\ndeterminations, Plan interpretations, eligibility and/or other determinations that it deems\n\nnecessary . . . .” The Plan also provides that “the City reserves the right to amend,\n\nsuspend or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time.” The Plan therefore\n\nappears to permit the City to enter into agreements such as the one at issue here. We\n\nare not persuaded by the City’s argument that the agreement is unenforceable under\n\nchapter 27 of the local government code and ERISA.\n\n       Finally, the City argues that any agreement to grant Casso health insurance\n\neligibility was unenforceable due to the statute of frauds. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE\n\nANN. § 26.01(a), (b)(6) (West 2009) (providing that “an agreement which is not to be\n\nperformed within one year from the date of making the agreement” is not enforceable\n\nunless the “agreement, or a memorandum of it, is (1) in writing; and (2) signed by the\n\nperson to be charged with the promise or agreement or by someone lawfully authorized\n\nto sign for him”).    Assuming arguendo that the statute of frauds applies to the\n\nagreement at issue, we find that the release agreement, which was written and was duly\n\nsigned by the City’s attorney, satisfies the statute’s requirements. The mere fact that\n\nthe release agreement was ambiguous as to Casso’s post-2002 health insurance\n\neligibility does not negate the agreement’s written character.\n\n       Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, see City\n\nof Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, we conclude that there was legally sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s findings that (1) the City agreed to treat Casso as a health\n\ninsurance “retiree” participant until the age of 65, and (2) the City breached that\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fagreement. Additionally, considering the evidence in a neutral light, we find that the\n\nevidence is factually sufficient to support those findings. The City’s first and second\n\nissues are overruled.\n\nB.     Medical Costs Damages\n\n       By its third issue, the City contends the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the award of medical cost damages corresponding to the breach\n\nof contract claim.\n\n       Question 3 of the jury charge asked what sum of money, if paid now in cash,\n\nwould fairly and reasonably compensate Casso for damages resulting from the City’s\n\nbreach of contract. Subsection (a) of question 3 asked the jury to assess “[t]he medical\n\ncosts, if any, paid or incurred by Dahlila Guerra Casso between January 1, 2004 and\n\nthe present, less the sum that Casso would have paid in monthly premiums during that\n\nperiod to obtain coverage under the City of McAllen, Texas health insurance plan.” The\n\njury answered “$38,523.43.” The City first contends by its third issue that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence of the difference between the medical costs incurred by Casso and\n\nthe sum she would have been required to pay for her health insurance coverage\n\nbetween January 1, 2004 and the time of trial. The City specifically claims that no\n\nattempt was made to show what the City’s insurance premium amounts were for retiree\n\nparticipants between January 1, 2004 and the time of trial.\n\n       We find that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s answer to charge\n\nquestion 3(a). Among the pieces of evidence before the jury were billing records from\n\nvarious medical providers that treated Casso during the relevant time period. Those\n\nbills reflected total medical costs of $58,306.19. The jury was also able to consider\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fseveral monthly invoices sent by the City between 2002 and 2003 asking Casso to pay\n\na monthly premium of $215.03.              The jury additionally heard testimony from City\n\nManager Mike Perez that the current monthly premium for a retiree participant is $245.\n\nThe jury could have chosen to disbelieve Perez and instead to believe that the 2002–\n\n2003 monthly invoices reflected the amount Casso would have been charged in monthly\n\npremiums between 2004 and 2011. See id. at 819. We therefore conclude that the jury\n\ncould have reasonably found that Casso suffered $38,523.43 in damages, representing\n\nthe difference between the amount she paid or incurred in medical costs and the\n\namount she would have been required to pay in insurance premiums from January 1,\n\n2004 to the time of trial.11\n\n       The City next argues by its third issue that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nestablish damages under question 3(b) of the jury charge, which asked the jury to\n\nassess:\n\n       The medical costs, if any, that in reasonable probability, would have been\n       or will be incurred by Dahlila Guerra Casso on and after January 1, 2004\n       that would have been actually paid by the City of McAllen, Texas health\n       insurance plan, less the sum that Casso would have paid in monthly\n       premiums during that period to obtain coverage under the City of McAllen,\n       Texas health insurance plan.[12]\n\n       11\n          The amount could have been reasonably calculated as follows: $58,306.19 (Casso’s incurred\nmedical costs between 2004 and 2011) minus $19,782.76 ($215.03 per month for 92 months, between\nJanuary 2004 and August 2011) equals $38,523.43.\n       12\n          As noted, question 3(a) asked the jury to assess the medical costs incurred by Casso between\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the time of trial; whereas question 3(b) asked the jury to assess the amount that\n“would have been” incurred or “will be incurred” by Casso “on and after January 1, 2004 that would have\nbeen actually paid” by the City’s health insurance plan, less the amount Casso would have paid in\npremiums. Question 3(b) therefore arguably invited the jury to award duplicate damages for medical\ncosts incurred by Casso between January 1, 2004 and the time of trial. However, as we noted supra at\nnote 6, the jury was specifically instructed not to award duplicate damages. Moreover, at the charge\nconference, Casso’s counsel set forth his theory as to why the questions did not create a risk of double\nrecovery:\n\n       Number one [question 3(a)] is the actual out of pocket medical costs that [Casso] paid on\n       that charge of $58,000 that we showed the jury. The second one [question 3(b)] is the\n\n                                                  19\n\fThe jury answered “$150,000.00.” The City contends that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto establish that these medical costs “would have been or will be” incurred by Casso.\n\n       Casso’s primary care physician, Michael Jelinek, M.D., testified that he has\n\ntreated Casso for her Lupus condition since 1992.                   He stated that Lupus is an\n\nautoimmune disease without a known cure, so treatment consists primarily of managing\n\na patient’s symptoms. According to Dr. Jelinek, Casso’s Lupus caused her to suffer\n\nsevere joint pain, the inability to walk, hair loss, and various infections. He testified that\n\nhe attempted to treat these symptoms by prescribing an immunomodulator, a\n\nmedication that suppresses the immune system.                          Dr. Jelinek testified that\n\nimmunomodulator therapy costs about $2,000 to $2,500 per infusion and that an\n\ninfusion should be administered every three to four weeks. For Casso’s treatment, Dr.\n\nJelinek prescribed Remicade, an immunomodulator that is administered intravenously.\n\nDr. Jelinek stated that Casso would need an infusion of Remicade—or, if Casso did not\n\nrespond to that medication, another immunomodulator—every three to four weeks for\n\nthe rest of her life.\n\n       The City notes that Casso suffered an adverse reaction to a Remicade infusion in\n\nJuly 2003 and that it was not certain that she would have been able to continue\n\nRemicade treatments beyond December 2003, when her health insurance eligibility was\n\n\n\n       measure of damages—the benefit of the bargain damages. The benefit of the bargain\n       damages are damages that are recoverable in a breach of contract case. And that is\n       what damages would put the Plaintiff in a position that the Plaintiff would have been [in]\n       had the contract been performed. Had the contract been performed she would have\n       received all of these Remicade treatments, for example, and the benefit of the bargain\n       measure is what is set forth there. It’s a description of these medical benefits that she\n       would have received had the contract been performed.\n\nAlthough the City objected at the charge conference on the basis that the submission of question 3(b)\ncreated a risk of double recovery, the City has not raised that issue on appeal.\n\n                                                  20\n\fterminated. The City also notes that Casso had not been prescribed Remicade until\n\n2003 and was using less-expensive medication prior to that time.\n\n       We find the evidence sufficient to support the jury’s answer to question 3(b).\n\nAlthough the City is correct in noting that Casso’s pre-2003 treatments were not as\n\nexpensive as the Remicade infusions, Dr. Jelinek testified that Casso’s condition\n\n“deteriorated substantially since the expiry of her insurance coverage” and that “the\n\nprogression of her illness could have been controlled or slowed down if proper care had\n\nbeen more forthcoming.”        The jury could have therefore reasonably concluded that\n\nRemicade or other immunomodulator treatment was necessary for Casso in the years\n\nbeyond 2003, even if it was not necessary for her before that time.                  Moreover, in\n\ndetermining damages, the jury has discretion to award damages within the range of\n\nevidence presented at trial. Gulf States Utils. Co. v.

As Casso notes, the evidence presented at trial could have supported an award\n\nof future medical damages exceeding $400,000, representing a $2,500 Remicade\n\ntreatment minus a $215.03 monthly premium payment every month from 2004 until\n\n2018, when Casso will become eligible for Medicare.13 Of course, the evidence could\n\nhave also supported a conclusion that Casso’s future medical costs were zero because\n\nshe had suffered an adverse reaction to Remicade, and Dr. Jelinek could not say for\n\nsure that post-2003 Remicade treatments would have been possible. But that is not\n\nwhat the jury found—and we cannot and will not substitute our judgment for that of the\n\njury. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, see City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to\n\n       13\n          That amount could be calculated as follows: $450,000 (representing monthly $2,500 Remicade\ntreatments over 180 months, from 2004 to 2018) minus $38,705.40 (representing monthly $215.03\npremium payments over the same time period) equals $411,294.60.\n\n                                                21\n\fsupport an award of $150,000 in medical cost damages under question 3(b). Viewing\n\nthe evidence in a neutral light, see Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176, we find the evidence\n\nfactually sufficient.\n\n        The City additionally complains by its third issue that the trial court failed to\n\nsubmit its requested instruction on mitigation of damages.

She also testified that she consulted with her insurance agent\n\nas to the availability of private health insurance. According to Casso, her agent replied\n\n“don’t bother. . . . I don’t know of anybody that’s going to insure you.” The City points to\n\ntestimony by Casso in which she appeared to acknowledge that she might qualify for\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fcertain insurance coverage available on the internet, despite her pre-existing\n\ncondition.14 However, the City was under a burden to produce evidence that Casso\n\nfailed to show diligence in pursuing alternative health insurance.

Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on\n\nmitigation of damages.\n\n        The City’s third issue is overruled.\n\nC.      Lost Profits Damages\n\n        By its fourth issue, the City argues that the evidence was insufficient to support\n\nthe award of lost profits damages pursuant to Casso’s breach of contract claim.15\n\n        The City first argues that lost attorney’s fees are not recoverable as a matter of\n\nlaw because they are not a foreseeable consequence of the breach of an unrelated\n\ncontract. The City cites Stuart v. Bayless, where the Texas Supreme Court held that an\n\n\n        14\n            The City’s counsel asked Casso: “Isn’t it true . . . that you’ve become aware of an insurance\npolicy for which you can qualify?” Casso replied: “Am I aware that I can qualify? No. Some [insurance\npolicies] have been mentioned. And I found it very offensive that it was suggested by your client . . . that I\ngo out and secure some insurance off the internet so that the City doesn’t have to provide and keep their\nobligation. . . .” Casso continued:\n\n        If that’s part of the national health care [act] that may be overturned next week or the\n        week after—if that’s what you’re referring to that one court finds unconstitutional and the\n        other upholds, I am not going to take care of—going to do the research because the City\n        has failed me and has breached the contract.\n\nThe parties are apparently referring to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”),\nwhich includes a “guaranteed issue” requirement barring insurers from denying coverage to any person\ndue to that person’s medical condition or history.

We find that Stuart does not\n\ncategorically preclude the recovery of attorney’s fees as lost profits; it only precludes the\n\nrecovery of such fees when their loss was not reasonably foreseeable. The defendant\n\nin Stuart could not have reasonably foreseen that her failure to pay the hourly-rate fee\n\nwould have caused the plaintiff’s law firm to refuse other, unrelated contingency-fee\n\ncases.     See id.   Here, in contrast, the City could have reasonably foreseen that\n\nterminating Casso’s health insurance eligibility would have had a deleterious effect on\n\nher earnings. The recovery of attorney’s fees as lost profits was therefore not barred as\n\na matter of law.\n\n         The City next contends by its fourth issue that the evidence adduced at trial was\n\ninsufficient to establish (1) a causal nexus between Casso’s loss of health insurance\n\ncoverage and her lost profits, or (2) the amount of such lost profits.

Battery Corp., 131 Tex. at 423, 115 S.W.2d at 1097).\n\n       To support her claim for lost profits damages, Casso introduced evidence of\n\nprofits from her law practice during the time she was insured, and evidence of her\n\nprofits during the time she was uninsured. When she left the City’s employment in\n\n1999, Casso’s annual salary was $70,000. Casso’s 2002 federal income tax return\n\nshows that she earned $71,938 in business income in that year, during which she was\n\nstill covered by the City’s health insurance. Other income tax returns showed: a loss of\n\n$2,530 in 2004; a profit of $30,991 in 2005; a profit of $18,149 in 2006; a profit of\n\n$6,904 in 2007; a loss of $8,343 in 2008; and a profit of $9,569 in 2009. Thus, Casso\n\n                                            25\n\fearned an average annual profit of $9,123.33 during the years 2004 to 2009, during\n\nwhich she did not have health insurance. The jury awarded $126,000 in past lost\n\nprofits, corresponding to years 2004 through 2011, and $126,000 in future profits,\n\ncorresponding to years 2012 through 2018, when Casso will become eligible for\n\nMedicare.\n\n      The City urges that Casso’s evidence was insufficient because the only evidence\n\nas to a “history of profitability” during the time she was covered by health insurance but\n\nnot employed by the City was her 2002 income tax return.          See id. We disagree.\n\nCasso also introduced evidence that she earned $70,000 in her final year of\n\nemployment as the City’s municipal judge. This evidence, along with the income tax\n\nreturns, constituted “facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits can be\n\nascertained.” See ERI Consulting Eng’rs, 318 S.W.3d at 876. Moreover, the particular\n\namount awarded by the jury was supported by the evidence. As noted, the evidence\n\nshowed that Casso earned an average annual profit of $9,123.33 between 2004 and\n\n2009, but that she earned an average of $70,969 in the years 1999 and 2002. The jury\n\ncould therefore have reasonably concluded that Casso suffered as much as\n\n$61,845.6716 in annual lost profits as a result of the City’s breach. That annual amount\n\nwould result in damages of $494,765.3617 for years 2004 to 2011 and $432,919.6918 for\n\nyears 2012 to 2018. The jury’s award of $126,000 for each of those respective time\n\nperiods therefore did not exceed the amounts supported by the evidence. We further\n\n\n      16\n           $70,969 minus $9,123.33.\n      17\n           $61,845.67 per year for eight years.\n      18\n           $61,845.67 per year for seven years.\n\n\n                                                  26\n\ffind that the evidence—including Dr. Jelinek’s testimony that Casso’s condition\n\ndeteriorated substantially after she lost health insurance—was legally and factually\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s implicit conclusion that Casso’s lost profits resulted from\n\nthe City’s termination of her health insurance eligibility.\n\n       The City’s fourth issue is overruled.\n\nD.     Attorney’s Fees Award\n\n       By its fifth issue, the City argues that the award of $150,000 attorney’s fees to\n\nCasso was erroneous because such fees were not recoverable from the City as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n       The award of attorney’s fees in this case was based on section 38.001 of the civil\n\npractice and remedies code, which provides that a “person may recover reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid\n\nclaim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n\nREM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2008). The question presented here is whether the\n\nCity is an “individual or corporation” for purposes of the statute. In 1986, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court held that the predecessor statute to section 38.001 permitted the\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees against a municipality where those fees were incurred in the\n\ncontext of enforcing a contract made by the municipality in its proprietary capacity.

GOV’T CODE ANN. ch. 271 (West 2005 & Supp. 2011)\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f(waiving governmental immunity for certain contract claims). However, prior to rendition\n\nof the final judgment, the City filed a supplemental response to Casso’s “Motion to Sign\n\nJudgment” in which it urged that “counties and cities are not individuals or corporations\n\nand, as such, a party may not recover attorney’s fees against them under the statute.”\n\nThe City cited the relevant statutory and case law in advancing that argument. It also\n\nmade this argument in its “Motion to Modify, Correct or Reform Judgment” filed after the\n\nfinal judgment was rendered.\n\n       We conclude that the issue has been preserved, see TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a), and\n\nthat it is meritorious. We therefore sustain the City’s fifth issue and modify the judgment\n\nto delete the attorney’s fees award.\n\nE.     Pre-Judgment Interest\n\n       By its sixth issue, the City argues that the award of pre-judgment interest on the\n\naward of medical cost damages pursuant to jury charge question 3(b) was\n\nimpermissible because the award was attributable in part to future medical costs. See\n\nTEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 304.1045 (“Prejudgment interest may not be assessed or\n\nrecovered on an award of future damages.”).\n\n       In response, Casso argues that the issue has not been preserved because the\n\nCity did not object to question 3(b) on the basis that two questions—one addressing\n\npast medical costs and one addressing future medical costs—should instead be\n\nsubmitted. Casso further contends that the issue lacks merit because the jury’s award\n\nof $150,000 in medical cost damages in response to question 3(b) could have been\n\nentirely attributable, under the evidence, to pre-trial medical costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       We disagree that the issue has not been preserved.             Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 274 states:     “A party objecting to a charge must point out distinctly the\n\nobjectionable matter and the grounds of the objection. Any complaint as to a question,\n\ndefinition, or instruction, on account of any defect, omission, or fault in pleading, is\n\nwaived unless specifically included in the objections.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 274. At the\n\ncharge conference, the City objected to the submission of question 3(b) on the basis\n\nthat it permitted double recovery of medical cost damages incurred by Casso between\n\nJanuary 1, 2004 and the date of trial. The City’s counsel argued: “I think what the\n\nCourt needs to say is that the first one [question 3(a)] is medical costs paid or incurred\n\nbetween January 2004 and the present. And the second one [question 3(b)] should say\n\nthe medical costs that will be incurred in reasonable probability from today forward . . . .”\n\n       In any event, the City is not, strictly speaking, challenging any element of the jury\n\ncharge by its sixth issue.     It does not claim that question 3(b) should have been\n\nbifurcated, and it does not claim that future damages should not have been submitted or\n\nawarded.    Instead, the City is merely claiming that the trial court should not have\n\nawarded pre-judgment interest on an award of medical cost damages that\n\nencompassed both past and future costs. Therefore, the more stringent preservation\n\nrequirements found in Rule 274 do not apply. Instead, to preserve the pre-judgment\n\ninterest issue, the City was required only to make a timely complaint to the trial court\n\nthat comports with its complaint on appeal. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Exxon Corp., 808\n\nS.W.2d at 655.     And, the City specifically objected to the award of pre-judgment\n\ninterest—on the same basis as it now raises on appeal—in its post-trial “Motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fCorrect, Modify or Reform Judgment.” Accordingly, the issue has been preserved for\n\nour review.\n\n       We further agree with the City that the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment\n\ninterest on the amount awarded by the jury in response to charge question 3(b),\n\nbecause past and future damages were not segregated. In Cavnar v. Quality Control\n\nParking, Inc., the Texas Supreme Court held that, because certain plaintiffs were\n\nawarded damages for both their past and their future losses in lump sums and past\n\nlosses were not segregated from future losses, those plaintiffs were not entitled to\n\nrecover pre-judgment interest on those elements of damages. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403455\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403455/cavnar-v-quality-control-parking-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556\n\n(Tex. 1985).19 The same result holds here. Because past and future damages were\n\nsubmitted to the jury but were not segregated in the damages question at issue, Casso\n\nis not entitled to pre-judgment interest on the amount awarded pursuant to that\n\nquestion.

See Johnson & Higgins of Tex. v.

However, where damages are awarded for economic injury rather than for personal\ninjury, Cavnar still controls. Davis, 175 S.W.3d at 397. Moreover, the modifications made in Johnson &\nHiggins do not affect the viability of Cavnar with regard to award of pre-judgment interest on damages\nawards that are not segregated between past and future damages.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f        We sustain the City’s sixth issue and modify the judgment to delete the award of\n\npre-judgment interest on the $150,000 awarded as damages under jury charge question\n\n3(b).\n\nF.      Specific Performance\n\n        By its seventh issue, the City argues that the trial court erred in commanding the\n\nCity to specifically perform the contract at issue by enrolling Casso on its health\n\ninsurance plan.    The City urges that this remedy violated the one-satisfaction rule.\n\nAgain, we agree. Specific performance is an equitable remedy that may be awarded\n\nupon a showing of breach of contract.

App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied). Specific performance is used as a\n\nsubstitute for monetary damages when such damages would not be adequate. Id. The\n\none-satisfaction rule provides that a plaintiff is entitled to only one recovery for any\n\ndamages suffered. See Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 390; Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.

The related doctrine of election of remedies bars a\n\nplaintiff from recovering both damages for breach of a contract and specific\n\nperformance of the contract. See NRG Exploration v.

Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1973, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (concluding that when party\n\nobtains final judgment for damages, party can no longer demand specific performance\n\nof contract).\n\n        Here, the final judgment awarded a total of $440,523.43 in actual damages. That\n\nsum included $150,000 awarded pursuant to the jury’s answer to charge question 3(b),\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fwhich    asked      the   jury   to    assess     all   “medical     costs . . . that   in   reasonable\n\nprobability . . . will be incurred by [Casso] on and after January 1, 2004 that would have\n\nbeen actually paid by the [City’s] health insurance plan,” less the amount that Casso\n\nwould expend in premium payments. The provision of the final judgment commanding\n\nthe City to enroll Casso on its health insurance plan remedies exactly the same\n\ndamages—i.e., coverage of Casso’s medical costs, minus her premium payments,\n\nthrough 2018. The award of specific performance was therefore in violation of the one-\n\nsatisfaction rule.20 We sustain the City’s seventh issue and modify the judgment to\n\ndelete the award of specific performance.\n\nG.      Fraud Claim\n\n        By its final five issues, the City argues that the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment on the jury’s fraud verdict.21 Specifically, the City contends by its eighth issue\n\nthat that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that the City committed\n\nfraud; by its ninth issue that the trial court erred by considering the jury’s finding that\n\nCasso was entitled to past lost profits as a result of the fraud; by its tenth issue that the\n\n        20\n           The City also claims by its seventh issue that specific performance was unavailable to Casso\nbecause she did not establish: (1) that she was ready, willing, and able to perform her obligations under\nthe contract; or (2) that her remedy at law was inadequate. See DiGiuseppe v. Lawler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895057\"><a href=\"/opinion/895057/digiuseppe-v-lawler/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n593 (Tex. 2008) (“An essential element in obtaining the equitable remedy of specific performance is that\nthe party seeking such relief must plead and prove he was ready, willing, and able to timely perform his\nobligations under the contract.”); City of Alton v.

App.—Corpus Christi 2009) (“It is a fundamental rule of equity that a court will not grant specific\nperformance unless it is shown that an adequate remedy does not exist at law.”), aff’d in part and rev’d in\npart on other grounds, Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v. City of Alton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011). We\nneed not address these sub-issues because of our conclusion that the award of specific performance\nviolated the one-satisfaction rule. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n        21\n           We note that there appears to be some confusion as to what alleged fraud Casso attempted to\nprove at trial. Casso’s live petition characterized her fraud claim as one for fraudulent inducement; she\nalleged that she was induced into signing the agreement because “[t]he City represented to Casso that its\noriginal COBRA proposal would not be part of the agreement after Casso expressly rejected that\nproposal.” On the other hand, on appeal, both parties confine their arguments regarding the fraud claim\nto the facts surrounding Casso’s execution of the blank “Enrollment/Change/Cancellation Form” at the\nCity’s request in 2001. We need not resolve the confusion because of our conclusion herein that any\nerror corresponding to the fraud judgment would not be reversible. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a), 47.1.\n\n                                                   33\n\fevidence of fraud was not clear and convincing; by its eleventh issue that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence supporting the award of exemplary damages 22; and by its twelfth\n\nissue that the fraud claim was barred by limitations.\n\n       We need not address these issues because the only damages actually awarded\n\npursuant to the fraud verdict were past lost profit damages of $126,000, and this award,\n\nas we have concluded, was also justified by the breach of contract finding. Accordingly,\n\neven if we were to find error with respect to each of the City’s five issues regarding the\n\nfraud verdict, those errors would not be reversible. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a) (stating\n\nthat, in a civil case, “[n]o judgment may be reversed on appeal on the ground that the\n\ntrial court made an error of law unless the court of appeals concludes that the error\n\ncomplained of:        (1) probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment; or (2)\n\nprobably prevented the appellant from properly presenting the case to the court of\n\nappeals”); TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1 (“The court of appeals must hand down a written opinion\n\nthat is as brief as practicable but that addresses every issue raised and necessary to\n\nfinal disposition of the appeal.”). The City’s eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\n\nissues are overruled.\n\n                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as modified herein. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 43.2(b).\n\n                                                         DORI CONTRERAS GARZA,\n                                                         Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n28th day of March, 2013.\n\n\n       22\n            As noted supra note 6, the final judgment did not contain an award of exemplary damages.\n\n\n                                                   34\n\f</pre>",
