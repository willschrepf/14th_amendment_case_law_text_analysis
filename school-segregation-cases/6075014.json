A fellow\n\nofficer, Stephen Schleig, accused Troxell of threatening him with termination, physical\n\nviolence, and even death, in retaliation for Schleig’s active involvement in a police union.\n\nTroxell moved to dismiss Schleig’s complaint on the basis of qualified immunity, and\n\nthat motion was denied by the District Court.\n\n       On appeal, Troxell argues that his conduct does not constitute retaliation and that,\n\neven if it did, the law did not clearly establish that his conduct was improper. Because\n\nthe District Court correctly determined that Troxell’s claim of qualified immunity could\n\nnot prevail at a preliminary stage of the case, we will affirm.\n\nI.     FACTS1\n\n       Schleig was employed as an officer with the Nazareth Borough Police\n\nDepartment. [App. at 22.] In 2009, he became involved in the local police union and\n\n\n       *\n        This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7,\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.\n           1\n         In reviewing the District Court’s rejection of Troxell’s motion to dismiss under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we “are required to accept all well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnon-moving party” – in this case Schleig. Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224,\n231 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n                                              2\n\fparticipated in union advocacy by filing grievances and reporting on purportedly unfair\n\nlabor practices in the police department. [App. at 23.] In part because of his union\n\nactivities, Schleig was heavily criticized by Chief of Police Thomas M. Trachta and other\n\nBorough officials and police officers. [App. at 24-28.] Trachta in particular retaliated\n\nagainst Schleig by publicly berating him, questioning his mental health, reassigning him\n\nto less desirable shifts, and giving him undesirable tasks. [App. at 25, 28, 31.]\n\n       Tensions in the Police Department further intensified when another officer,\n\nFrederick J. Lahovski, Jr., who was also active in the labor union, brought a lawsuit\n\nagainst the Police Department alleging violations of constitutional rights. [App. at 32.]\n\nTrachta and other officers, including Troxell, suspected that Schleig was assisting\n\nLahovski with his lawsuit by providing him with copies of incident reports and other\n\ndocuments. [App. at 32.]\n\n       In November 2013, animosity within the department increased when Troxell\n\nconfronted Schleig. [App. at 32.] According to Schleig’s Complaint,\n\n       Troxell stated … that he suspected another police officer was assisting\n       Lahovski with his case by providing Lahovski with copies of incident\n       reports involving … Troxell, and … Troxell intended to harm that\n       individual once he learned his identity. Specifically, … Troxell indicated\n       to [Schleig] that he intended to get the individual fired, file criminal\n       charges against the individual for alleged theft, and further go after the\n       individual physically and cause them [sic] severe harm as well as severe\n       harm to the individual’s family. … Troxell proceeded to threaten [Schleig]\n       and any individual found to be supporting Lahovski by stating that he [i.e.,\n       Troxell] and … Trachta were going to end the alleged culprit’s life. …\n       Troxell made very clear to [Schleig] that he was very serious and was in\n       no way exaggerating or joking.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f(App. at 32-33.) As the verbal abuse proceeded, Troxell revealed that he and Trachta had\n\na plan to spy on those suspected of being sympathetic to Lahovski, including Schleig.\n\n[App. at 33.] Troxell specifically questioned whether Schleig had given Lahovski a copy\n\nof Troxell’s resume. [App. at 33.] Troxell then\n\n       indicated that [the Borough of Nazareth] … Trachta … and [the Borough\n       Council] were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected that\n       [Schleig] was assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit … . Troxell continued by\n       telling [Schleig] that … Trachta had evidence that was going to cause\n       [Schleig] to lose his job and get arrested because he was suspected of being\n       the “spy for the union.”\n\n(App. at 33.)\n\n       The harassing conduct from Trachta and other officers and Borough officials\n\ncontinued until Schleig brought the present lawsuit. [App. at 35-40.] Schleig sued the\n\nBorough of Nazareth, its present and former Mayors and the Borough Council, Trachta,\n\nTroxell, and other Police Department officers (collectively the “Defendants”) pursuant to\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. [App. at 16-21.] He alleged that the Defendants conspired to violate\n\nand violated his First Amendment rights of free speech, free association, and the ability to\n\npetition for redress of grievances. [App. at 41-51.] He also argued that the Defendants\n\nconspired to violate and violated his rights to substantive and procedural due process and\n\nequal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. [App. at 51-53.]\n\n       After the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, Schleig filed an Amended\n\nComplaint. [App. at 4, 16] The Defendants then submitted a motion to dismiss the\n\nAmended Complaint, which the District Court granted in part. [App. at 4.] The Court\n\ndismissed with prejudice the claims against some of the Defendants, including the former\n\n\n                                             4\n\fMayor and other members of the Borough Council, and it also dismissed the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and conspiracy claims against all Defendants. [App. at 1-2.] It refused,\n\nhowever, to dismiss Schleig’s First Amendment retaliation claims against Troxell and\n\nsome of the other Defendants, [App. at 4.] and it denied Troxell’s motion to dismiss on\n\nthe basis of qualified immunity. [App. at 9.] The Court concluded that “[Schleig’s]\n\nAmended Complaint is sufficient to plead a claim for retaliation,” (App. at 9), and that\n\nTroxell’s qualified immunity defense failed because “[i]t is clearly established that a\n\npublic employee has the constitutional right to speak as a citizen on matters of public\n\nconcern without fear of retaliation.” (App. at 10 (citing Dougherty v. Sch. Dist. of\n\nPhiladelphia, 772 F.3d 979, 987 (3d Cir. 2014)).) Troxell then brought this timely appeal\n\nchallenging the District Court’s refusal to grant him qualified immunity.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION2\n\n       Qualified immunity protects government actors from suit “insofar as their conduct\n\ndoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\n\nOur analysis of qualified immunity proceeds in two parts, which may be tackled in either\n\n       2\n         The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1343(a)(3). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. “[A] district court’s\ndenial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an\nappealable ‘final decision’ within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291[.]” Mitchell v.\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). In this case, we have jurisdiction because the\nquestion at issue is “whether the law allegedly violated was clearly established at the time\nof the defendant’s actions … the type of legal issue immediately appealable as a final\ndecision.” Zaloga v. Borough of Moosic, 841 F.3d 170, 174 n.3 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s denial of\nthe motion to dismiss. Acierno v. Cloutier, 40 F.3d 597, 609 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n                                              5\n\forder based on our “sound discretion.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009).\n\nFirst, we consider “whether the alleged facts, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\ninjured party, ‘show [that] the [government official]’s conduct violated a constitutional\n\nright[.]’” Zaloga v. Borough of Moosic, 841 F.3d 170, 174 (3d Cir. 2016) (first and\n\nsecond alterations in original) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)).\n\nSecond, we “ask whether the right was clearly established ‘in light of the specific context\n\nof the case, [and] not as a broad general proposition.’” Id. (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201).\n\n       On appeal, Troxell argues that the District Court erred when it concluded that his\n\nremarks could constitute unconstitutional threats of retaliation. He also argues that, even\n\nif he threatened Schleig, his actions did not violate clearly established law. But based on\n\nthe detailed allegations of the Amended Complaint – allegations that we are bound to\n\naccept as true at this stage of the proceedings – Troxell’s threats against Schleig\n\nconstitute textbook retaliatory speech, and “every reasonable official” in Troxell’s shoes\n\n“would have understood that what he [was] doing violate[d]” Schleig’s right against\n\nretaliation. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011) (quoting Anderson v.\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)).\n\n       A.     Schleig Made a Valid Claim of First Amendment Retaliation\n\n       As a general principle, it is well established that “public employees do not\n\nsurrender all of their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment” and may\n\n“speak[] as citizens about matters of public concern,” without retaliation or punishment.\n\nDougherty, 772 F.3d at 987 (quoting Garcetti v Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 417 (2006)).\n\n                                              6\n\fSpeech that is critical of unlawful labor practices qualifies as speech on matters of public\n\nconcern, see Davignon v. Hodgson, 524 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that,\n\nwhen labor speech is intended “to publicly express criticism of management,” that fact\n\n“weigh[s] heavily” in finding that the speech involved a matter of public concern); Clue\n\nv. Johnson, 179 F.3d 57, 61 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that “activities on behalf of a union\n\nfaction that necessarily entail a substantial criticism of management raise matters of\n\npublic concern”), so long as it addresses “fundamental problems” reaching beyond the\n\nemployee’s “day-to-day minutiae,” Watters v. City of Phila., 55 F.3d 886, 894 (3d Cir.\n\n1995), and does not solely discuss “mundane employment grievances,” Munroe v.\n\nCentral Bucks Sch. Dist., 805 F.3d 454, 467 (3d Cir. 2015). The publicly-minded critic is\n\nthus entitled to be free of retaliation.\n\n       “To prevail on a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must prove ‘(1) that he engaged in\n\nconstitutionally-protected activity; (2) that the government responded with retaliation;\n\nand (3) that the protected activity caused the retaliation.’” Miller v. Mitchell, 598 F.3d\n\n139, 147 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Eichenlaub v. Twp. of Indiana, 385 F.3d 274, 282 (3d\n\nCir. 2004)). Only the second element is at issue in this appeal.3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The parties do not, at this time, dispute that Schleig was engaged in a\nconstitutionally-protected activity with his pro-union speech. See Pickering v. Bd. of\nEduc., 391 U.S. 563, 574 (1968) (explaining that First Amendment speech protections\nonly apply to government employees speaking out on matters of public concern); Hotel &\nRest. Emps. & Bartenders Int’l Union Local 54 v. Read, 832 F.2d 263, 265 (3d Cir. 1987)\n(noting that “some union activity presumably comes within the right to associate for\nexpressive purposes”). Nor is there any dispute, at this time, with regard to causation.\n\n                                              7\n\f       The parties disagree as to whether Troxell’s remarks constitute an unlawful threat\n\nof retaliation. Schleig alleges that Troxell threatened to get him fired as a result of\n\nSchleig’s continued union activities. “[T]he threat of dismissal from public employment\n\nis … a potent means of inhibiting speech.” Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 574\n\n(1968). Therefore, the threat of dismissal, depending on its clarity and credibility, can\n\nform the basis for a claim of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. See id.\n\n(noting that the “exercise of [the] right to speak on issues of public importance may not\n\nfurnish the basis for … dismissal from public employment”).\n\n       But threatening a loss of livelihood is relatively small stuff here. According to\n\nSchleig, Troxell threatened to kill him. [App. at 32.] In the few cases in which\n\ngovernment officials have made death threats in response to constitutionally protected\n\nactivity, no one has tried to claim that the offending official’s behavior is something other\n\nthan unlawful retaliation. Even the strained defenses in those cases have evidently not\n\ntried to stretch that far. Cf. Santiago v. Blair, 707 F.3d 984, 992 (8th Cir. 2013)\n\n(concluding that “a reasonable jury could find that threats of death, issued by a\n\ncorrectional officer tasked with guarding a prisoner’s segregated cell, would chill a\n\nprisoner of ordinary firmness from engaging in the prison grievance process”); Van\n\nDeelen v. Johnson, 497 F.3d 1151, 1157 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that “allegations of\n\nphysical and verbal intimidation, including a threat by a deputy sheriff to shoot him if he\n\nbrought any more tax appeals, would surely suffice under our precedents to chill a person\n\nof ordinary firmness from continuing to seek redress for (allegedly) unfair property tax\n\nassessments”). We have found no precedent that puts in doubt the unlawful retaliatory\n\n                                              8\n\fcharacter of Troxell’s conduct as alleged in the Amended Complaint, and, indeed, it is\n\nobvious. See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002) (“For a constitutional right to be\n\nclearly established, its contours ‘must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\n\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right. ... [I]n the light of pre-existing\n\nlaw the unlawfulness [of the government official’s conduct] must be apparent.’” (quoting\n\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640)).\n\n       To find some cover, Troxell argues that he did not threaten Schleig with retaliation\n\nbecause his remarks were not actually directed at Schleig. [Opening Br. at 24.] He\n\nclaims that, at the time, he “did not know that [Schleig] was the individual about whom\n\nhe was speaking” and therefore he “could not have formed the specific intent necessary to\n\nretaliate.” (Opening Br. at 24). But Troxell’s recitation of the facts is inconsistent with\n\nthe allegations in Schleig’s Complaint. Schleig alleges that Troxell directly threatened\n\nhim with termination, in terms of both employment and existence, because of pro-union\n\nactivities. [App. at 32-33.] While Troxell began his conversation with Schleig by\n\nthreatening an unnamed informant, he quickly made clear that he and the other\n\nDefendants “were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected that [Schleig]\n\nwas assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit against Defendants for violations of his\n\nconstitutional rights.” (App. at 33.) Accepting Schleig’s account of the facts, again as\n\nwe must, Troxell clearly directed his threats of retaliation at Schleig in a manner that a\n\njury could find violated Schleig’s constitutional rights.\n\n       B.     Schleig’s Actions Violate Clearly Established Law\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       Troxell next argues that, even if we conclude that he unlawfully threatened\n\nSchleig, we should nevertheless conclude that his actions did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law. [Opening Br. at 22.] This is a position that barely warrants a response.\n\nThirty years ago, in a case involving retaliation against a police officer no less, we held\n\nthat “retaliatory discharges” were “clearly established” as unlawful. Bennis v. Gable, 823\n\nF.2d 723, 733 (3d Cir. 1987). And, as already discussed, it should go without saying that\n\nno reasonable officer could think that it was lawful to threaten to injure or kill an\n\nemployee because of that employee’s participation in a labor union.\n\n       Troxell asserts, however, that words that merely threaten without subsequent\n\nconcrete action, are not clearly established as a violation of the First Amendment’s\n\nprotection against retaliation. [Opening Br. at 25.] In advancing that proposition,\n\nTroxell relies on an erroneous interpretation of our recent decision in Zaloga v. Borough\n\nof Moosic, taking language from the opinion out of context. (See Opening Br. at 25\n\n(quoting Zaloga, 841 F.3d at 176 (“[O]ur cases do not provide government officials with\n\nclear guidance as to when a government official’s own speech can nevertheless constitute\n\nunconstitutional retaliation.”))). In that case, an individual brought suit against a\n\npolitician who, in retaliation for political criticism, urged other government officials not\n\nto renew a contract with the individual’s business. Zaloga, 841 F.3d at 172-73.\n\nHowever, the politician in that case did not have the power to take adverse action himself\n\nand did not do anything more than suggest to other officials that they should not contract\n\nwith that individual. Id. at 173. We explained that when a public official retaliates\n\nmerely by speaking out critically, “the official’s ‘own First Amendment speech rights are\n\n                                              10\n\fimplicated.’” Id. at 176 (quoting McLaughlin v. Watson, 271 F.3d 566, 573 (3d Cir.\n\n2001)). 4 Therefore, “[i]t is not enough that defendant speaks critically of plaintiff or\n\neven that defendant directly urges or influences the third party to take adverse action.\n\nRather, defendant must ‘threaten’ or ‘coerce’ the third party to act.” Id. (quoting\n\nMcLaughlin, 271 F.3d at 573). “[I]n the absence of a threat, coercion, or intimidation,\n\nintimating that punishment, sanction, or adverse regulatory action will follow, such\n\nspeech does not adversely affect a citizen’s First Amendment rights even if defamatory.”\n\nMcLaughlin, 271 F.3d at 573 (citation omitted).\n\n       Zaloga plainly does not stand for the proposition that an official is free to threaten\n\nto terminate or physically harm an employee because the official is speaking his mind. In\n\ncontrast to the defendant in Zaloga, Troxell did not simply criticize Schleig or suggest to\n\nothers that Schleig should be punished for his activities. Instead, Troxell “intimat[ed]\n\nthat punishment, sanction, or adverse … action” would follow as a direct result of\n\nSchleig’s union activities. Id. (citation omitted). In particular, he made it clear that he\n\nand the other Defendants “were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected\n\nthat [Schleig] was assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit against Defendants for violations\n\nof [Lahovski’s] constitutional rights[,]” (App. at 33) and he let Schleig know that “severe\n\n       4\n         McLaughlin v. Watson, another case relied upon by Troxell, is also easily\ndistinguishable. 271 F.3d 566 (3d Cir. 2001). In McLaughlin, a U.S. Attorney for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania was sued for advocating that agents of the Pennsylvania\nAttorney General’s Office be fired. Id. at 568. Critical to our decision that the U.S.\nAttorney was entitled to qualified immunity was the fact that a U.S. Attorney had no\nauthority to threaten or coerce a state officer and therefore his suggestion of retaliation\nwas mere speech. Id. at 573-74. Here, in contrast, Troxell threatened to take direct\nretaliatory action against Schleig.\n\n                                             11\n\fharm” or death would follow. (App. at 32.) Such direct threats of adverse action are\n\nsquarely prohibited by Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this Court.\n\nTherefore, Troxell is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage. Whether a jury will\n\nbelieve Schleig’s allegations and any associated proof is yet to be seen.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f",

A fellow\n\nofficer, Stephen Schleig, accused Troxell of threatening him with termination, physical\n\nviolence, and even death, in retaliation for Schleig’s active involvement in a police union.\n\nTroxell moved to dismiss Schleig’s complaint on the basis of qualified immunity, and\n\nthat motion was denied by the District Court.\n\n       On appeal, Troxell argues that his conduct does not constitute retaliation and that,\n\neven if it did, the law did not clearly establish that his conduct was improper. Because\n\nthe District Court correctly determined that Troxell’s claim of qualified immunity could\n\nnot prevail at a preliminary stage of the case, we will affirm.\n\nI.     FACTS1\n\n       Schleig was employed as an officer with the Nazareth Borough Police\n\nDepartment. [App. at 22.] In 2009, he became involved in the local police union and\n\n\n       *\n        This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7,\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.\n           1\n         In reviewing the District Court’s rejection of Troxell’s motion to dismiss under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we “are required to accept all well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnon-moving party” – in this case Schleig.

Cty. of Allegheny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387268\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387268/phillips-v-county-of-allegheny/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n231 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n                                              2\n\fparticipated in union advocacy by filing grievances and reporting on purportedly unfair\n\nlabor practices in the police department. [App. at 23.] In part because of his union\n\nactivities, Schleig was heavily criticized by Chief of Police Thomas M. Trachta and other\n\nBorough officials and police officers. [App. at 24-28.] Trachta in particular retaliated\n\nagainst Schleig by publicly berating him, questioning his mental health, reassigning him\n\nto less desirable shifts, and giving him undesirable tasks. [App. at 25, 28, 31.]\n\n       Tensions in the Police Department further intensified when another officer,\n\nFrederick J. Lahovski, Jr., who was also active in the labor union, brought a lawsuit\n\nagainst the Police Department alleging violations of constitutional rights. [App. at 32.]\n\nTrachta and other officers, including Troxell, suspected that Schleig was assisting\n\nLahovski with his lawsuit by providing him with copies of incident reports and other\n\ndocuments. [App. at 32.]\n\n       In November 2013, animosity within the department increased when Troxell\n\nconfronted Schleig. [App. at 32.] According to Schleig’s Complaint,\n\n       Troxell stated … that he suspected another police officer was assisting\n       Lahovski with his case by providing Lahovski with copies of incident\n       reports involving … Troxell, and … Troxell intended to harm that\n       individual once he learned his identity. Specifically, … Troxell indicated\n       to [Schleig] that he intended to get the individual fired, file criminal\n       charges against the individual for alleged theft, and further go after the\n       individual physically and cause them [sic] severe harm as well as severe\n       harm to the individual’s family. … Troxell proceeded to threaten [Schleig]\n       and any individual found to be supporting Lahovski by stating that he [i.e.,\n       Troxell] and … Trachta were going to end the alleged culprit’s life. …\n       Troxell made very clear to [Schleig] that he was very serious and was in\n       no way exaggerating or joking.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f(App. at 32-33.) As the verbal abuse proceeded, Troxell revealed that he and Trachta had\n\na plan to spy on those suspected of being sympathetic to Lahovski, including Schleig.\n\n[App. at 33.] Troxell specifically questioned whether Schleig had given Lahovski a copy\n\nof Troxell’s resume. [App. at 33.] Troxell then\n\n       indicated that [the Borough of Nazareth] … Trachta … and [the Borough\n       Council] were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected that\n       [Schleig] was assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit … . Troxell continued by\n       telling [Schleig] that … Trachta had evidence that was going to cause\n       [Schleig] to lose his job and get arrested because he was suspected of being\n       the “spy for the union.”\n\n(App. at 33.)\n\n       The harassing conduct from Trachta and other officers and Borough officials\n\ncontinued until Schleig brought the present lawsuit. [App. at 35-40.] Schleig sued the\n\nBorough of Nazareth, its present and former Mayors and the Borough Council, Trachta,\n\nTroxell, and other Police Department officers (collectively the “Defendants”) pursuant to\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. [App. at 16-21.] He alleged that the Defendants conspired to violate\n\nand violated his First Amendment rights of free speech, free association, and the ability to\n\npetition for redress of grievances. [App. at 41-51.] He also argued that the Defendants\n\nconspired to violate and violated his rights to substantive and procedural due process and\n\nequal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. [App. at 51-53.]\n\n       After the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, Schleig filed an Amended\n\nComplaint. [App. at 4, 16] The Defendants then submitted a motion to dismiss the\n\nAmended Complaint, which the District Court granted in part. [App. at 4.] The Court\n\ndismissed with prejudice the claims against some of the Defendants, including the former\n\n\n                                             4\n\fMayor and other members of the Borough Council, and it also dismissed the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and conspiracy claims against all Defendants. [App. at 1-2.] It refused,\n\nhowever, to dismiss Schleig’s First Amendment retaliation claims against Troxell and\n\nsome of the other Defendants, [App. at 4.] and it denied Troxell’s motion to dismiss on\n\nthe basis of qualified immunity. [App. at 9.] The Court concluded that “[Schleig’s]\n\nAmended Complaint is sufficient to plead a claim for retaliation,” (App. at 9), and that\n\nTroxell’s qualified immunity defense failed because “[i]t is clearly established that a\n\npublic employee has the constitutional right to speak as a citizen on matters of public\n\nconcern without fear of retaliation.” (App. at 10 (citing Dougherty v.

Troxell then brought this timely appeal\n\nchallenging the District Court’s refusal to grant him qualified immunity.\n\nII.

He also argues that, even\n\nif he threatened Schleig, his actions did not violate clearly established law. But based on\n\nthe detailed allegations of the Amended Complaint – allegations that we are bound to\n\naccept as true at this stage of the proceedings – Troxell’s threats against Schleig\n\nconstitute textbook retaliatory speech, and “every reasonable official” in Troxell’s shoes\n\n“would have understood that what he [was] doing violate[d]” Schleig’s right against\n\nretaliation.

Schleig alleges that Troxell threatened to get him fired as a result of\n\nSchleig’s continued union activities. “[T]he threat of dismissal from public employment\n\nis … a potent means of inhibiting speech.” Pickering v.

Therefore, the threat of dismissal, depending on its clarity and credibility, can\n\nform the basis for a claim of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. See id.\n\n(noting that the “exercise of [the] right to speak on issues of public importance may not\n\nfurnish the basis for … dismissal from public employment”).\n\n       But threatening a loss of livelihood is relatively small stuff here. According to\n\nSchleig, Troxell threatened to kill him. [App. at 32.] In the few cases in which\n\ngovernment officials have made death threats in response to constitutionally protected\n\nactivity, no one has tried to claim that the offending official’s behavior is something other\n\nthan unlawful retaliation. Even the strained defenses in those cases have evidently not\n\ntried to stretch that far. Cf. Santiago v.

Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739 (2002) (“For a constitutional right to be\n\nclearly established, its contours ‘must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\n\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right. ... [I]n the light of pre-existing\n\nlaw the unlawfulness [of the government official’s conduct] must be apparent.’” (quoting\n\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640)).\n\n       To find some cover, Troxell argues that he did not threaten Schleig with retaliation\n\nbecause his remarks were not actually directed at Schleig. [Opening Br. at 24.] He\n\nclaims that, at the time, he “did not know that [Schleig] was the individual about whom\n\nhe was speaking” and therefore he “could not have formed the specific intent necessary to\n\nretaliate.” (Opening Br. at 24). But Troxell’s recitation of the facts is inconsistent with\n\nthe allegations in Schleig’s Complaint. Schleig alleges that Troxell directly threatened\n\nhim with termination, in terms of both employment and existence, because of pro-union\n\nactivities. [App. at 32-33.] While Troxell began his conversation with Schleig by\n\nthreatening an unnamed informant, he quickly made clear that he and the other\n\nDefendants “were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected that [Schleig]\n\nwas assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit against Defendants for violations of his\n\nconstitutional rights.” (App. at 33.) Accepting Schleig’s account of the facts, again as\n\nwe must, Troxell clearly directed his threats of retaliation at Schleig in a manner that a\n\njury could find violated Schleig’s constitutional rights.\n\n       B.     Schleig’s Actions Violate Clearly Established Law\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       Troxell next argues that, even if we conclude that he unlawfully threatened\n\nSchleig, we should nevertheless conclude that his actions did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law. [Opening Br. at 22.] This is a position that barely warrants a response.\n\nThirty years ago, in a case involving retaliation against a police officer no less, we held\n\nthat “retaliatory discharges” were “clearly established” as unlawful. Bennis v. Gable, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491468\"><a href=\"/opinion/491468/thomas-f-bennis-roger-j-maclean-v-carson-s-gable-joseph-s-daddona/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733 (3d Cir. 1987). And, as already discussed, it should go without saying that\n\nno reasonable officer could think that it was lawful to threaten to injure or kill an\n\nemployee because of that employee’s participation in a labor union.\n\n       Troxell asserts, however, that words that merely threaten without subsequent\n\nconcrete action, are not clearly established as a violation of the First Amendment’s\n\nprotection against retaliation. [Opening Br. at 25.] In advancing that proposition,\n\nTroxell relies on an erroneous interpretation of our recent decision in Zaloga v. Borough\n\nof Moosic, taking language from the opinion out of context. (See Opening Br. at 25\n\n(quoting Zaloga, 841 F.3d at 176 (“[O]ur cases do not provide government officials with\n\nclear guidance as to when a government official’s own speech can nevertheless constitute\n\nunconstitutional retaliation.”))). In that case, an individual brought suit against a\n\npolitician who, in retaliation for political criticism, urged other government officials not\n\nto renew a contract with the individual’s business. Zaloga, 841 F.3d at 172-73.\n\nHowever, the politician in that case did not have the power to take adverse action himself\n\nand did not do anything more than suggest to other officials that they should not contract\n\nwith that individual. Id. at 173. We explained that when a public official retaliates\n\nmerely by speaking out critically, “the official’s ‘own First Amendment speech rights are\n\n                                              10\n\fimplicated.’” Id. at 176 (quoting McLaughlin v. Watson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775567\"><a href=\"/opinion/775567/john-mclaughlin-charles-a-micewski-dennis-j-mckeefery-edward-eggles-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (3d Cir.\n\n2001)). 4 Therefore, “[i]t is not enough that defendant speaks critically of plaintiff or\n\neven that defendant directly urges or influences the third party to take adverse action.\n\nRather, defendant must ‘threaten’ or ‘coerce’ the third party to act.” Id. (quoting\n\nMcLaughlin, 271 F.3d at 573). “[I]n the absence of a threat, coercion, or intimidation,\n\nintimating that punishment, sanction, or adverse regulatory action will follow, such\n\nspeech does not adversely affect a citizen’s First Amendment rights even if defamatory.”\n\nMcLaughlin, 271 F.3d at 573 (citation omitted).\n\n       Zaloga plainly does not stand for the proposition that an official is free to threaten\n\nto terminate or physically harm an employee because the official is speaking his mind. In\n\ncontrast to the defendant in Zaloga, Troxell did not simply criticize Schleig or suggest to\n\nothers that Schleig should be punished for his activities. Instead, Troxell “intimat[ed]\n\nthat punishment, sanction, or adverse … action” would follow as a direct result of\n\nSchleig’s union activities. Id. (citation omitted). In particular, he made it clear that he\n\nand the other Defendants “were working on going after [Schleig] because they suspected\n\nthat [Schleig] was assisting Lahovski with his lawsuit against Defendants for violations\n\nof [Lahovski’s] constitutional rights[,]” (App. at 33) and he let Schleig know that “severe\n\n       4\n         McLaughlin v. Watson, another case relied upon by Troxell, is also easily\ndistinguishable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775567\"><a href=\"/opinion/775567/john-mclaughlin-charles-a-micewski-dennis-j-mckeefery-edward-eggles-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2001). In McLaughlin, a U.S. Attorney for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania was sued for advocating that agents of the Pennsylvania\nAttorney General’s Office be fired. Id. at 568. Critical to our decision that the U.S.\nAttorney was entitled to qualified immunity was the fact that a U.S. Attorney had no\nauthority to threaten or coerce a state officer and therefore his suggestion of retaliation\nwas mere speech. Id. at 573-74. Here, in contrast, Troxell threatened to take direct\nretaliatory action against Schleig.\n\n                                             11\n\fharm” or death would follow. (App. at 32.) Such direct threats of adverse action are\n\nsquarely prohibited by Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this Court.\n\nTherefore, Troxell is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage. Whether a jury will\n\nbelieve Schleig’s allegations and any associated proof is yet to be seen.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f</pre>",
